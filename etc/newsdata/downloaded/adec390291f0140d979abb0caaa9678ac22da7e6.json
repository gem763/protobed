Photo: Bob Berg/Getty Images\n\nAfter hearing the sad news that Ric Ocasek, co-frontman for the Cars, died on Sunday, I immediately conjured an image of Ocasek in my head. That image was of Ric Ocasek as a fly.\n\nThen, Ocasek as a tube of lipstick. And a coat hanger. And the face of an alarm clock.\n\nAll of these snapshots come from the Cars\u2019 video for one of their biggest hits, \u201cYou Might Think,\u201d a video I watched thousands of times in the 1980s and one in which Ocasek keeps popping up in the life of a woman with whom he\u2019s clearly unhealthily obsessed. Like many things from the \u201980s, it reads different now than it did then. Now, that video looks like exhibit A in the weirdest, worst stalking case in human history. But at the time, it was cheeky, clever, and an example of how inventive music videos could be. At the very first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, it won Video of the Year. One of the nominees it beat? Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, Ocasek\u2019s role as a shapeshifter in that video speaks to what was so appealing about him and his band. The Cars released six albums during their core productive years (1978-1987) and a seventh after the death of bassist and frequent lead singer Benjamin Orr. Given that output, it\u2019s extraordinary how many hits they produced and how enduring those songs continue to be. Just look at the tracks on their eponymous first album: \u201cGood Times Roll,\u201d \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl,\u201d \u201cJust What I Needed,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re All I\u2019ve Got Tonight.\u201d All of them are among their greatest hits, all of them were released on their first shot, and all of them were written by Ocasek.\n\nThe Cars\u2019 appeal was wide because you could hear them in more than one way. If you were a traditional rock fan, you hooked into the guitar riffs of \u201cJust What I Needed\u201d or the infectious tempo of \u201cShake It Up.\u201d If you were more into New Wave, the synthesized accents on \u201cMoving in Stereo\u201d and the even heavier synths heard on just about every song on 1984\u2019s Heartbeat City, their most commercially successful album, were what grabbed you. They sounded at once like pop-music past and pop-music future.\n\nThe Cars were the kind of band that everyone in your family liked. (My mom loved them. So did my older brother. So did I.) No one objected to the Cars, because what kind of weirdo objects to the Cars? You could dance to their music, but you also could just chill out to it. Their bangers sent you out into the wild of a Saturday night (\u201cLet\u2019s go / I like the nightlife, baby!\u201d) and their more downbeat tracks helped you mourn being dumped (\u201cOh baby, why can\u2019t I have you?\u201d). All of their songs, still, sound like summer to me.\n\nAnd all of their songs are associated, first and foremost, with Ric Ocasek. There\u2019s no debating the band could not have been what it was without its other members: Orr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes, and drummer David Robinson. But Ocasek, as the primary songwriter, constructed the Cars\u2019 entire sound. Even though he shared vocal responsibilities with Orr, Ocasek was the true face of the band, the guy you thought of first when you thought of the Cars. With his impressive, gangly height (he was reportedly six-foot-four), his long, striking face, and his tendency to wear dark glasses and \u201980s blazers, he looked like the cocktail that got poured after mixing up Roy Orbison, Joey Ramone, and David Byrne in a shaker. Again: the past, and also the future.\n\nJust as he and the band do in the \u201cYou Might Think\u201d video, Ocasek and the Cars have continued to insert themselves into the culture and our lives. You can still hear their sound in the music of Weezer, whom Ocasek produced and mentored, and in countless other bands whose work bridges the gap between pop and synth-inflected rock. You can hear them on television in shows like Dead to Me, where the still gorgeous \u201cDrive\u201d played a major role in a karaoke scene, and American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, where Aimee Mann performed a lovely cover of the same song, and in the departed but not forgotten Braindead, where \u201cYou Might Think\u201d became a clever, quite literal earworm stalking Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who heard it everywhere she went. The Cars absolutely sound like the \u201970s and \u201980s, but there\u2019s also something timeless in what they put out into the world. A song like \u201cMoving in Stereo\u201d could play a key role in the most memorable scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, then be used again, more than 30 years later, to pay homage to the same Fast Times scene in season three of Stranger Things. If it\u2019s possible to hear music while stuck in a time loop, I\u2019m pretty sure the Cars is one of the bands you\u2019ll hear if you ever get stuck in one.\n\nThe other image of Ocasek that immediately bubbled up in my brain after hearing of his death came from another video of a major Cars hit: \u201cMagic.\u201d In it, a crowd of random people \u2014 hippies, a pair of twins in very \u201980s evening wear, a guy dressed as Uncle Sam, a pilot who is carrying two trumpets for some reason \u2014 gather around a Beverly Hills swimming pool to worship Ocasek, who is standing in the middle of it. All of these admirers seem to have little in common other than a belief that Ocasek is the messiah. Those of us watching this on MTV or Friday Night Videos from the comfort of our living rooms just saw him as the guy from the Cars who could suddenly walk on water thanks to special effects. Which, honestly, seemed almost as cool as being the actual messiah.\n\nWe saw something different than the characters in the video did. But our reaction \u2014 the desire to be closer to the guy responsible for making that sound \u2014 was the same. He had a hold on us. It was, indeed, magic.", "description": "An appreciation of Ric Ocasek, the frontman for The Cars, who died at age 75 and wrote hits like \u201cJust What I Needed,\u201d \u201cYou Might Think\u201d and \u201cDrive.\u201d", "authors": ["Jen Chaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/17-ric-ocasek.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
