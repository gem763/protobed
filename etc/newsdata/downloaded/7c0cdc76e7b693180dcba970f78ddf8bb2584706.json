The cause of death was not disclosed.\n\n\u201cIt is with great sadness we confirm our beloved Robert passed away yesterday night,\u201d Hunter\u2019s family announced in a statement. \u201cHe died peacefully at home in his bed, surrounded by love. His wife Maureen was by his side holding his hand. For his fans that have loved and supported him all these years, take comfort in knowing that his words are all around us, and in that way he is never truly gone. In this time of grief please celebrate him the way you all know how, by being together and listening to the music. Let there be songs to fill the air.\u201d\n\nAlthough proficient on a number of instruments including guitar, violin, cello and trumpet, Hunter never appeared on stage with the Grateful Dead. \u201cI had my choice,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cI had my go at that and it didn\u2019t work for me.\u201d\n\nInstead he was content to stay in the background and let his written words speak for him during the band\u2019s 30-year run that ended with the 1995 death of guitarist Jerry Garcia.\n\nHunter\u2019s songs included Truckin\u2019, Uncle John\u2019s Band, Box of Rain and Ripple. He also collaborated with Bob Dylan and others, including Hart and other members of the Grateful Dead.\n\n\u201cI was basically a maverick and a rebel\u2019s rebel even among the Dead,\u201d he said to Rolling Stone in 2015.", "description": "The man behind the words for Truckin\u2019 and Ripple, among others, died at his home in northern California", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b94828c42fd7aa3b96622d7811d8f2f21b623e49/0_236_5637_3384/master/5637.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d933050de979f81afd43629b860a979", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
