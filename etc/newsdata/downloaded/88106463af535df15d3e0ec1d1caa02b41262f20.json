But that isn\u2019t what Everton need, particularly not in a season when a place in the top six, maybe even top four, is there for the \u00adtaking.\n\nA lot of the chat by Everton fans on \u00adsocial media is that Silva has to go with Duncan \u00adFerguson put in charge as a \u00adtemporary \u00admeasure.\n\nThe feeling is Big Dunc would at least put a bit of fight back into the players and hark back to the \u2018Dogs of War\u2019 while they looked for \u00adanother manager.\n\nI can understand that because at Hull, Watford and now Everton, Silva has been distinctly average overall.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nAnd what really gets my goat is that British and Irish managers have been overlooked for him. We\u2019re a football crazy nation and with plenty of talent. But whether it has been with \u00adplayers, \u00admanagers or coaches, we\u2019ve all too often favoured an exotic name over one of our own.\n\nThis season the tide has turned a bit with talented youngsters hailing from these shores \u00adproducing the goods from Chelsea to Sheffield United and now Newcastle.\n\nAnd hopefully that has served as a reminder that at every level of our game and in every aspect of it there are people more than \u00adcapable of \u00adbringing plenty to the table.\n\nWhen Silva does walk out of English football he will go with \u00adseveral million pounds in his back pocket and my question will be, \u00ad\u2018Having given our game exactly what?\u2019\n\nBecause no one can tell me Eddie Howe wouldn\u2019t have made a better fist of things at Everton than Silva has done if he\u2019d have been given the job.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to be all jingoistic about homegrown managers because at the very top Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho will always be great managers wherever they go.\n\nBut Silva isn\u2019t in that bracket, so what is it on his CV that means he deserves to be managing Everton over someone who was born on home soil.\n\nHe is a very lucky man and if he doesn\u2019t massively change tack and start getting results in the next month, he\u2019ll be a goner.", "description": "Everton slumped to a fifth defeat of the season and dropped into the relegation zone after losing to Burnley 1-0 this weekend", "authors": ["Stan Collymore", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20533035.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Burnley-FC-v-Everton-FC-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
