They join a growing list of states and other localities, including Columbus, Ohio. Yes, the explorer\u2019s namesake declined to celebrate him last year, the first non-observance since the city\u2019s founding.\n\n(One place the name change failed was New Hampshire, where a bill passed the state house but died in the senate. Though its failure was not due to a lack of endorsements.)\n\n\u201cMy view on this is why would we not want to honor indigenous people?\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren in January. \u201cThese were the people who were here. These were the people who in Massachusetts reached out and helped the first settlers to Massachusetts Bay colony and helped them survive those first harsh and rugged years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren masqueraded for decades as someone of native descent, including describing herself as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d on her 1986 Texas Bar registration card. A 1997 Fordham Law Review article billed her as the \u201cfirst woman of color\u201d to teach at Harvard Law School. A DNA test last year proved definitively that she is as little as 1/512th American Indian. Her deception shows that she would much rather honor (and identify with) the native people than the European settlers they helped.\n\n\u201cThere is power in a name and in who we choose to honor,\u201d said Maine Governor Janet Mills as she signed a bill to recognize Indigenous People\u2019s Day.\n\nBut national holidays ought to be just that: national. They should honor the nation\u2019s history, founding, and culture. Holidays are not about inclusion or diversity; they\u2019re about unifying and bonding. They\u2019re about celebrating everything uniquely American, not removing it.\n\nStudent groups, however, don\u2019t share that understanding. Reminiscent of my own George Mason University, the student government at the University of Oklahoma voted to remove the Pledge of Allegiance from their congressional agenda and linked it directly to Columbus Day.\n\n\u201cIt was written as a celebration of Columbus Day in 1892, and in the city of Norman we don\u2019t celebrate Columbus Day, we celebrate Indigenous People\u2019s Day,\u201d said the student senator who authored the bill. \u201cI was really able to connect with a lot of the international students and them saying thank you for writing it.\u201d\n\nWhy are foreign students given precedence over what holidays Americans celebrate? Aren\u2019t they studying here to experience and appreciate our history and culture? Not to the students at GMU or OU, who are taught by professors like Elizabeth Warren to hate anything related to the arrival of Europeans on American shores.\n\nLast year, a week prior to Columbus Day, the century-old bronze statue of Thorfinn Karlsefni in Philadelphia was knocked over into the Schuylkill River. Karlsefni was a Viking explorer, an associate of Leif Erickson, and the father of Snorri Thorfinnson, the first European child born in the Americas. Even without the baggage that discolors Christopher Columbus\u2019 legacy, the Karlsefni statue was still decried as racist and a monument to white supremacy before its defacing.\n\nAt its core, the movement to destroy Columbus Day has nothing to do with the Italian explorer\u2019s morally despicable actions in Hispaniola. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who established Columbus Day as a federal holiday in 1937, described the real reason in his 1940 celebratory statement:\n\nThe courage and the faith and the vision of the Genoese navigator glorify and enrich the drama of the early movement of European people to America. Columbus and his fellow voyagers were the harbingers of later mighty movements of people from Spain, from Columbus\u2019s native Italy and from every country in Europe. And out of the fusion of all these national strains was created the America to which the Old World contributed so magnificently.\n\nThe primary motivation of activists (and sometime vandals) who want to institute Indigenous People\u2019s Day is their hatred for European exploration, the original sin of the modern world. Cultural arsonists seek to correct this through a systematic replacement of the descendants of European colonization. Tearing down our nation\u2019s heroes is a first step to tearing down the rest of the historic American nation. Don\u2019t let them.\n\nHappy Columbus Day.\n\nHunter DeRensis is a reporter for The National Interest.
