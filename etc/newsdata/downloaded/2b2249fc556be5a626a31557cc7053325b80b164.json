But strip out the strained speechifying on that subject and it could have been made at any time in the last 40 years. There are some funny lines, and, despite the literary setting, Assayas can\u2019t resist cinephile gags, particularly a bizarre juxtaposition of Star Wars: The Force Awakens with Michael Haneke\u2019s searing drama The White Ribbon. But once we\u2019ve reached an in-joke about the movie\u2019s own female lead \u2013 Juliette Binoche \u2013 the film has started munching its own tail.\n\nVincent Macaigne is L\u00e9onard, an author of middling literary fiction based on his own failed marriage and affairs. His sales are declining, and his urbane publisher Alain (Guillaume Canet) wants to drop him from his list; they have an excruciating lunch at which Alain can\u2019t bring himself to say this out loud. But L\u00e9onard is having an affair with Alain\u2019s wife, Selena (Binoche), whose loyal cheerleading on the home front may have been the only thing keeping L\u00e9onard\u2019s career alive. Alain himself is having an affair with his head of digital policy, Laure (Christa Th\u00e9ret).\n\nJust as L\u00e9onard is periodically asked if he is writing \u201cautofiction\u201d and if this is a viable genre, so Assayas seems to be playing around with the idea of autofilm. There is one interesting line: brooding on online abuse rising as literacy falls, L\u00e9onard remarks about trolls: \u201cThey less they read, the more wary they are of writing.\u201d Very true.\n\n\u2022 Non-Fiction is released in the UK on 18 October.", "description": "Olivier Assayas\u2019s drama, set in the world of publishing, strains in vain to make zeitgeisty points about the future of books", "authors": ["Peter Bradshaw"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b909f7b69f3969e4e857f72d31158baf56dc40a/278_159_5031_3019/master/5031.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=32cecf80b46bc423542f16d4c615d954", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
