They were 189 lives\" lost, he added.\n\nHowever, investigators said they did not have a mandate to assign blame or recommend sanctions.\n\nThe sit-down with relatives came after Boeing on Tuesday replaced the chief of its commercial plane division, the most significant executive departure since the 737 MAX grounding plunged the company into crisis seven months ago.\n\nBoeing faced new scrutiny following text messages from November 2016 in which a test pilot described the MCAS during a simulation as \"running rampant\" and behaving in an \"egregious\" manner.\n\nThe company shared the messages with the Department of Justice in February.\n\nBut the FAA learned of their existence only recently and publicly criticised Boeing for withholding them.\n\nBoeing is facing scores of lawsuits, and a plaintiffs' lawyer previously told AFP that it had so far reached settlements with 11 families of victims.\n\nBut some relatives expressed scepticism about Boeing and the law firms suing the company.\n\n\"We have no information on the compensation Boeing is offering,\" Imam Rismanto, who lost his older brother in the crash, said before Wednesday's meeting.\n\n\"Some law firms contacted us, but we're afraid they'll just use us ... We don't want anyone taking advantage of us just because this is a major case.\n\n\"And we don't want a constant reminder of this sad accident - we just want to move on,\" he added.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [JAKARTA] Mechanical and design problems with a Boeing 737 MAX flight control system were key factors in the crash of a Lion Air jet last year, Indonesian investigators told victims' families in a briefing on their findings Wednesday. .
