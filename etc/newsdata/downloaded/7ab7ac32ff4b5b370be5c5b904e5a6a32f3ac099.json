But does truth still matter?", "language": "en", "text": "MORE THAN ever before in Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the U.S. political system faces a fundamental question: Does truth still matter? Our democracy depends on a positive answer. But the evidence of the past few days offers reason for worry.\n\nIn the matter of Ukraine, Congress and the public now have before them an indisputable set of facts. A rough transcript prepared and issued by the White House reveals repeated demands by Mr. Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky launch politicized investigations, including of Joe Biden, who currently leads Mr. Trump by a wide margin in polling for next year\u2019s presidential election. The transcript shows Mr. Trump first raising his request for \u201ca favor\u201d in response to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s appeal to buy antitank weapons his army desperately needs. After Mr. Zelensky pledges to carry out the probes, Mr. Trump promises a prize he has been withholding for months: a White House visit.\n\n[Who\u2019s who in the whistleblower complaint]\n\nAgainst this clear record of suborning support for his reelection campaign, Mr. Trump has thrown up a smokescreen of denials, insults \u2014 and blatant lies. Over and over, he and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have repeated the easily disproved claim that Mr. Biden sought to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to protect his son. Senior Ukrainian officials, including one of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s own sources, have publicly stated that the story is false; multiple media investigations have definitively debunked it. Yet the president just goes on peddling it.\n\nOther Trump lies are even more far-fetched: that Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter \u201cmade millions of dollars from China\u201d; or that President Barack Obama sought dirt on Mr. Trump from foreign leaders. Mr. Trump tweeted that Democrats \u201cwent to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.\u201d Again, an easily established falsehood.\n\nThrough most of our political history, such a contest between documented facts and proven lies would be lopsided. When President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s lies were exposed by White House tapes, his own Republican Party quickly turned against him. Yet in the past few days Mr. Trump\u2019s propaganda has been embraced and echoed by GOP legislators and conservative media. Against the clear evidence of the transcript, they proclaim: \u201cNo quid pro quo!\u201d Despite the abundant proof that neither Mr. Biden nor his son is guilty of wrongdoing in Ukraine, they reiterate dark insinuations about the former vice president\u2019s \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d\n\n[The Post\u2019s View: The whistleblower adds to the case that Trump offered Ukraine\u2019s president a quid pro quo]\n\nWhat we could be left with, if Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy succeeds, is a partisan standoff where there is no common ground of accepted facts. Like Russia\u2019s Vladi\u00admir Putin, who uses lies to cloak his foreign aggressions, Mr. Trump wants to leave Americans with the impression that there is no discernible, objective truth about his behavior, only rival claims by bickering politicians and media in Washington that are best discounted or ignored. He doesn\u2019t need to prove the Bidens are corrupt. He needs only to cast a shadow on the otherwise black-and-white evidence of the transcript.\n\nThere is really only one clear remedy for this, and that is for Republicans of integrity to stand up and acknowledge that Mr. Trump sought to pressure a foreign leader into digging up dirt on his foremost political opponent \u2014 and that it was wrong. A few have moved in that direction: Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio) deserve some credit. But more must speak up. Those who remain silent, or worse, join in Mr. Trump\u2019s lying game, will be complicit in the degradation of the U.S. polity.", "description": "Republicans must not defend the president\u2019s smokescreen of denials, insults \u2014 and blatant lies.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gRrdCbhYG6Yd_mUTYWLEfd-5ze0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NASRB3HAUQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
