With about 54% of the vote counted, the Socialists led with 36.7%. Preliminary results tend to initially focus more on smaller towns and the final picture could still change.\n\nThe main opposition Social Democrats (PSD) were on 24.2% to 31% of the exit polls and 28.4% of the preliminary results.\n\nThe range of percentages of votes given by the pollsters was quite wide. Depending on how close the outcome eventually is, a clear picture could emerge quickly or take days or even weeks.\n\n\u2018WE GOT STRONGER\u2019\n\nAt the Socialist Party (PS) election rally, supporters stood up cheering as the exit polls were published.\n\nPortugal's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PS) candidate Antonio Costa reacts after preliminary results in the general election in Lisbon, Portugal, October 7, 2019. REUTERS/Jon Nazca\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great victory for the PS, that\u2019s what has to be underscored. The party will seek to have a stable four-year government solution for Portugal,\u201d Mendes, the PS deputy secretary general, told supporters.\n\nThe four exit polls put the Socialists in a range of 33.3 to 40%. While it was not immediately clear if even the most optimistic scenario could deliver a full majority, it would in any case give them more seats than in the last election, in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe got stronger from this election and we will be able to continue with our policies,\u201d said 25-year-old supporter Miguel Matos.\n\nCosta was seen getting a boost from the southern European country\u2019s economy. It is growing more than the EU average, helped by export growth and a booming tourism industry that last year saw more tourists visit Portugal than it has inhabitants.\n\nPost-election negotiations are not expected to be as messy as in neighbouring Spain, which still has no government more than five months after elections and is heading for a repeat vote in November.\n\nIn 2015, it took less than two months for Costa, whose party had come in second behind the PSD, to strike an unexpected alliance with two far-left, Eurosceptic parties and be sworn in as prime minister.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nThe People-Animals-Nature party (PAN) attracted more votes than in the previous election, riding a wave of popularity among pro-environment parties in much of Europe. But it was not immediately clear if it could become a kingmaker, landing in a range of 2.3% to 5.3% of the vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good result. I still wish it was more, because the country needs to move quickly to tackle the climate emergency,\u201d PAN supporter Paulo Santos, 43, said at the party\u2019s evening rally.\n\nThe election already claimed its first political victim.
