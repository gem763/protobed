It\u2019s a big job.\n\nBut Pina doesn\u2019t just lead part of Google\u2019s business across a third of the globe \u2014 he\u2019s changing the lives for thousands of people both inside and outside the tech giant.\n\nThis is the reason why one of the world\u2019s most prominent diversity and inclusion organisations, INvolve, has placed Pina at the top of its OUTstanding 100 LGBT+ Executive Role Models List in 2019, which is supported by Yahoo Finance.\n\nPina, who is the only openly LGBT+ VP at Google EMEA, told Yahoo Finance he is \u201chonoured\u201d and \u201cdeeply humbled\u201d to top the list.\n\n\u201cThis award is not just for me but for my team and the allies that I am just lucky to represent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe work we have been doing at Google is possible because of the committed Googlers who are passionate about making sure Google is the reflection of the rich & diverse tapestry of the people who use our products and services.\u201d\n\nThe OUTstanding LGBT+ Role Model Lists are a powerful reflection of the incredible achievements of LGBT+ people in the business community. The lists are published annually and cover LGBT+ Executives, LGBT+ Future Leaders, Ally Executives, and Public Sector LGBT+ Executives.\n\nPina said awards like these are important because \u201cthey are catalysts for hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was a young boy, I wasn\u2019t aware of any role models or heroes in this space. Or awards. Or visible LGBTQ+ executives, politicians or artists,\u201d Pina said. \u201cThere were no role-models. I would look up and see nobody like me. There was no hope for a life where I could be my true self without sacrificing my happiness.\n\n\u201cThese lists solve for that \u2014 they provide hope.\u201d\n\n\u2018Change starts and spreads at the individual level, one Googler at the time\u2019\n\nA \"G\" sign is on display during the press tour.

Throughout his time at the company, he has woven in diversity and inclusion practices that are changing the company from inside out.\n\nHis advocacy roles are too numerous to list but include:\n\nExecutive Sponsor for Google\u2019s EMEA Diversity & Inclusion programmes (covering more than 10,000 Googlers in EMEA);\n\nHead of the EMEA Gayglers, Google\u2019s regional LGBTQ+ employee inclusion group;\n\nChampion for Google EMEA to ensure that all Googlers (20,000+) take a quarterly goal to make Google a better, more-inclusive, place to work (#ItsUpToMe).\n\nPina has also:\n\nDriven an EMEA Roadshow across 32 cities in 20 countries that instilled better diversity & inclusion behaviours within teams, especially around LGBTQ+. (The programme is now being extended to Asia-Pacific and the US.);\n\nLed 20+ Google country leaders to send messages of support to their local teams on National Coming Out Day. In 2019, Google supported 24 cities across 20 countries \u2014 its strongest presence yet \u2014 with more than 30,000 Googlers marching and Google showing up to support them at Pride, Black Pride, and Trans Pride.\n\nLed several of Google\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ partnerships including with Stonewall UK, and headed a number of new initiatives launched with the organisation \u2014including a bespoke programme for LGBTQ+ leaders at Google to learn how to be an authentic leader.\n\nSupported and helped many organisations, such as Diageo (DGE.L) and Unilever (ULVR.L), by being a panelist and keynote speaker, helping to shape their employee conversations around LGBTQ+ equality and inclusion.\n\nMuch of Pina\u2019s work involves large scale programmes or partnerships aimed at driving change. But his most poignant moments involve individual impact.\n\n\u201cWhat moves me is to get the odd email from a Googler, who decided to come out at work because of something we have done,\u201d he said. \u201cOr when someone decides to have kids or marry, because he/she was encouraged by one of our talks. Or when a heterosexual senior director decides to become an active and enthusiastic LGBTQ+ ally at its business unit as a result of the enthusiasm of a local LGBTQ+ chapter.\n\n\u201cChange starts and spreads at the individual level, one Googler at the time. And that\u2019s what I am focused on.\u201d\n\n\u2018Consistency is my next milestone\u2019\n\nParticipants hold up a Google banner during Berlin's annual Christopher Street Day (CSD) gay pride parade on July 22, 2017.

While some are excellent, others are still learning.\n\n\u201cI want our baseline to be the same in every corner of EMEA. And that requires leadership, lots of heavy lifting and significant enthusiasm. And, air miles too.\u201d", "description": "Pedro Pina isn\u2019t just the vice president for global client & agency solutions in EMEA at Google (GOOG) \u2014 he\u2019s changing the lives for thousands employees inside and outside the tech giant.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OryHUImLTqPkLeZ68MPNSg--~B/aD0xNDM0O3c9MjA2MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/ff205480-f3e5-11e9-b77f-19fc7b74d6fd", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
