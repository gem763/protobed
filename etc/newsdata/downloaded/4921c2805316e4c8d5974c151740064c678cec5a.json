Investors are accustomed to belligerence from Trump before he dials down his rhetoric, said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy that we have seen in the past - keeping the pressure very high and then settling for whatever deal is possible,\u201d he said.\n\nAny progress in talks next month would probably fall short of a comprehensive deal, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely than not that there will some kind of agreement that would be more cosmetic in nature.\u201d\n\nAlso supporting the mood in Asia was economic data from China on Monday that showed sustained weakness in exports but a surprising improvement in domestic consumption indicators.\n\n\u201cThis is better than what the market was expecting,\u201d said Alessia Berardi, senior economist at Amundi, adding that markets were downplaying the likelihood of a major escalation in the trade war by Washington.\n\n\u201cThe probability of implementing the (delisting) decision for the market is still quite low,\u201d she said.\n\nChinese markets will trade only on Monday before a week-long holiday that marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe dollar was little changed against a basket of six major currencies .DXY, adding 0.1% to 99.117.
