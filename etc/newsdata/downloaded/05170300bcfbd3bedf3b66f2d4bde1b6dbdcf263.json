A global launch plan is under review. '\n\nHuawei will launch the Mate X in China next month after multiple delays pushed the device's release back\n\nHuawei's Mate X is among the first phones to pioneer a new breed of folding device and comes with a collapsible screen that can be used in two configurations.\n\nWhen open, the display spans 8 inches and appears closer to a tablet. While closed, the phone folds onto itself for a more traditional-looking 6.6-inch display.\n\nThe biggest question for the Mate X will be durability since the phone's screen wraps around its hinge on the exterior instead of folding inside.\n\nThis means the phone's display is constantly exposed and could lead to problems similar to those faced by its direct competitor the Galaxy Fold.\n\nSamsung's Fold, which retails for $1,980, recently went on sale after myriad problems with the display that plagued initial test by reviewers.\n\nAmong the issues were dust and particles finding their way underneath the display and causing bumps and blemished in addition to interfering with the hinge mechanism.\n\nThe Mate X will look to avoid the flaws documented via Samsung's select release of the Galaxy Fold\n\nAnother issue caused some reviewers to mistake the screen for a screen protector and attempt to peel it off of the device, a mistake the irreparably damage the screen.\n\nFor the Mate X, a hard release in China will proceed after multiple delays from the company throughout the last year.\n\nThe device was delayed in June and again in August, though it's unclear exactly what was causing the postponement.\n\nAt the same time, Huawei has struggled with an ongoing trade dispute between the US and China that has seen the company essentially blacklisted by the US government.", "description": "The company announced that it will begin shipping its Mate X in China on November 15 and told The Verge that it is in the process of outlining plans for an international release.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/10214724-0-image-a-7_1571844811934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
