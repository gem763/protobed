These are valid elements, but that cannot be all.\u201d\n\nBecause of an overemphasis on outreach to the poor, evangelization has been neglected, the priest lamented.\n\nWhile a focus on the poor in Latin America may have been \u201cprophetic\u201d at the time, there are bigger issues to deal with today, he noted.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental thing is missing: the first proclamation [of the Gospel],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe love for the poor and a social commitment are consequences of the faith,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the most important thing, the transmission of the faith, has been interrupted. We live in a different world than the 1970s, and we cannot continue to have the proposals of 1970.\u201d\n\nThe overly simplistic categories applied to Latin America through the influence of Marxism do not capture the complex realities in play today, he suggested.\n\nMany in the Church see the reality of Latin America just in terms of \u201crich and poor,\u201d he said, when the reality is more nuanced.\n\n\u201cThere are rich and poor, yes, but also men and women, indigenous peoples who live in the Andes, those who live in the Amazon, and there\u2019s an important Afro-descendant culture,\u201d he said.\n\nThe priest also criticized what he considers an overemphasis on the issue of priestly celibacy in the Vatican synod hall, arguing that it is not a matter for just one region to decide.\n\nThe question of priestly celibacy is \u201cnot pertinent to this synod,\u201d he said, because it is \u201ca very rich issue for the whole Church, and it cannot be decided by only one region.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the importance of a synodal conversion,\u201d he added. \u201cWell, if we\u2019re going to discuss this issue, let\u2019s ask our brothers from Congo what they think about it, those from Mexico, from Vietnam, from Argentina, from the Far East.\u201d\n\nEvangelization is at the heart of missionary work, the priest explained, but in many places it has been abandoned and replaced by other concerns.\n\nSome bought into the myth that \u201cevangelization destroys cultures\u201d and is \u201canthropologically negative,\u201d Lasarte said. As a result, many within the Catholic Church gave up evangelization altogether, convinced that \u201cgiving witness is enough.\u201d\n\nThis was a big mistake, Lasarte said.\n\n\u201cPope Paul VI says in Evangelii Nuntandi that evangelization requires the explicit announcement of the Word, the doctrine, Christ,\u201d he said. \u201cWitness and service are central, but so is proclamation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are afraid of speaking about Jesus Christ, in fear of offending others,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Many missionaries in Latin America are still living in the 1970s, a Synod father said, as if class struggle topped the gospel.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
