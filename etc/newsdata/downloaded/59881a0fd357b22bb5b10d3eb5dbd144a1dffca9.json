It\u2019s awful. It would put a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea and annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nJim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, called the deal \u2013 welcomed by the Irish government and Sinn F\u00e9in \u2013 a disaster that would put Northern Ireland in the Republic of Ireland\u2019s economic orbit, ensuring the union \u201cslowly bleeds to death\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe inescapable reality is that a permanent regulatory and customs border cutting us off from GB puts us in a waiting room for Irish unity with the door locked from the outside.\u201d\n\nMany farmers and business owners, in contrast, welcomed a deal that would keep trade flowing and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. \u201cWhat is good is that a deal is struck, we can move on to the more positive conversation about the future relationship and, regardless, Northern Ireland can continue to have tariff-free, quota-free access to both the UK and the EU\u2019s single market,\u201d said the Manufacturing Northern Ireland chief executive, Stephen Kelly.\n\nThey are relieved they have certainty as the new arrangements will mean the same trading environment for four years beyond the transition period. Stormont then gets to vote, and if the new regime is popular and can command 60% support \u2013 with at least 40% each of the nationalist and unionist votes \u2013 it will be rolled over for another eight years, a protracted EU alignment that is anathema to the DUP.\n\nThe party\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC that he felt the Benn act preventing no deal had pushed Boris Johnson \u201cinto desperate measures\u201d.\n\nDodds said: \u201cHe has been too eager by far to get a deal at any cost, and the fact of the matter is, if he held his nerve and held out he would, of course, have got better concessions that kept the integrity, both economic and constitutionally, of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nUnder Johnson\u2019s deal, Northern Ireland would legally remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory but stay in the EU\u2019s single market for goods. The EU\u2019s customs code would be enforced on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.\n\nUnder a complicated consent mechanism, four years after the end of the transition period, the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont would vote on maintaining the arrangements. Crucially, the DUP would have no veto.\n\nThe DUP rejected the deal and vowed to vote against it, saying it would undermine the integrity of the union and drive \u201ca coach and horses\u201d through the Good Friday agreement\u2019s consent mechanism.\n\nOnce the details became clear DUP leaders pivoted towards a campaign to retain their base, said one source. \u201cShouting traitor from the green benches might suit them.\u201d\n\nSome Brexiters will blame the party if the deal falters in the Commons, further straining relations between Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists and English Conservatives.\n\nRival unionists said DUP hubris led to the deal.\n\nA year ago the party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, boasted of its unprecedented influence at Westminster \u2013 where its 10 MPs propped up the government \u2013 and garlanded Johnson at its party conference. Johnson said Northern Ireland should be treated no differently from the rest of the UK.\n\nTwo weeks ago Johnson, under pressure for a deal with Brussels, persuaded his allies to accept some regulatory alignment with the EU, necessitating checks in the Irish Sea.\n\nThat concession \u2013 a DUP recognition that farmers and business owners feared a no-deal hit on Northern Ireland\u2019s economy \u2013 facilitated Downing Street stretching the measure to clinch a deal with Brussels, said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and co-author of a book about the DUP.\n\nHow is Boris Johnson's Brexit deal different from Theresa May's? Read more\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been completely stitched up by Boris Johnson. He reversed on all that he promised them. This deal gives the EU and Irish government huge economic leverage over Northern Ireland.\u201d Tonge called the consent mechanism a fantasy given Stormont\u2019s dysfunction \u2013 it has been mothballed since power sharing collapsed in January 2017.\n\nThe anti-abortion DUP may receive another humiliation on Monday when abortion rights are due to be extended to Northern Ireland, the result of a vote by Labour and Conservative MPs at Westminster earlier this year.\n\nThe Stormont assembly is due to sit on Monday for the first time since devolution collapsed after more than 30 members backed a recall petition to debate the law. Analysts said it was unlikely they could stop the law taking effect.", "description": "UUP leader says party\u2019s blunders threaten to put Northern Ireland on \u2018window ledge\u2019 of union", "authors": ["Rory Carroll", "Lisa O'Carroll", "Larry Elliott Economics Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749ab62f0b598325c6e65c6d238e47f7791f2226/0_30_2737_1643/master/2737.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7e7c2ed4b471f58409b8fbd4c7f68507", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
