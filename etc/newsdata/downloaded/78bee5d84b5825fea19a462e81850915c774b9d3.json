He moved from the city of Ibadan to the Igbatoro village to work and save up for university as his parents were too poor to pay for his education.\n\nAnother man, Kabiru Ogundijo, 34, has worked in the wood and timber business since 1991. A high school drop out, he says has made good fortune selling wood.\n\nA form of biomass, wood is the sole source of energy for hundreds of millions of Africans, who lack access to modern sources of power, and logging remains a lucrative business that has contributed to the rapid shrinking of Africa\u2019s rainforests and woodlands.\n\nFor many communities which are not and have never been connected to the national electricity grid, it is their sole source of energy and many Nigerians rely on firewood for their cooking needs.\n\nBut Nigeria lost just over 2 million hectares of forest annually between 2005-2010 driven by agricultural expansion, logging and infrastructure development.\n\nIn one of the bushes I noticed that logging had significantly reduced the animal habitat. I suspect many nearby communities and villages were left without windbreakers.\n\nWhile there could be a few temporary gains from logging, the practice remains environmentally devastating and deserves the attention of the international community and the government at home.", "description": "For hundreds of millions of Africans who lack access to modern sources of power, wood, a form of biomass, is the sole source of energy.", "authors": ["Akintunde Akinleye"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ__DfjURfkKskkmMYCUxjhzU5nJLK7-3DJxrK7QhXpbJ8e887X7rsMxHcQW5OgReycYVUKWnr0Ltuae88nG-7yaPBu114SRUu0pUNgCXgH04", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
