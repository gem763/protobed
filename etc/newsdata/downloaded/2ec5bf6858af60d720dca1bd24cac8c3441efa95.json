It is cheap and brings a long list of health benefits,\u201d said Prof Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England.\n\nFoster stressed that advice on muscle strengthening was too often overlooked. \u201cIt has become the forgotten guideline,\u201d he said, adding that such activities were important in staving off a natural decline in muscle mass and bone density as we age. \u201cIt is much more important than we have probably thought,\u201d he said.\n\nOlder adults at risk of falls are again advised to take up activities like bowls or tai chi twice a week to improve balance and co\u2011ordination, while for the first time the guidelines for adults have also explicitly been extended to disabled adults, again recommending 150 mins of moderate activity and two days of strength and balance exercises a week.\n\n\u201cAny myths about physical activity being inherently harmful for disabled people should be dispelled,\u201d the report states.\n\nFive ways to move more \u2013 without going to the gym Read more\n\nThe updated recommendations also mention pregnant women and new mothers, with at least 150 minutes of moderate activity recommended a week, together with twice-weekly muscle strengthening exercises. However, it adds that women should tailor their physical activity to their stage of pregnancy, or delivery, and that vigorous activity should be avoided if an individual is not used to it.\n\nFor pregnant women, the guidelines state that exercise can bring benefits including reduced weight gain and a reduction in risk of gestational diabetes. The report also says moderate activity after giving birth helps women regain strength, improve their emotional wellbeing and return to their pre-pregnancy weight.\n\n\u201cBeing active won\u2019t affect the quality of your breastmilk or breastfeeding,\u201d said Foster, adding that the guidelines also advise new mothers to undertake pelvic floor exercises, and that women should wait until six to eight weeks after giving birth before gradually building up vigorous exercise.\n\nThe guidelines also include recommendations for babies as well as children and young people. Among them, babies that are not yet crawling are recommended to have at least 30 minutes of tummy time throughout the day while they are awake.\n\nHolly Holder, evidence manager at the Centre for Ageing Better, welcomed the report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see these guidelines focusing on the importance of exercises which improve muscle strength and support good balance, which we know can have a huge impact on keeping us healthier for longer and reducing the risk of falls in later life,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of us don\u2019t realise the huge difference this kind of activity can make to our wellbeing, especially as we age.\u201d", "description": "Activities such as sprinting up stairs are positive for health, says UK chief medical officer", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9b88ec6c02d99c93191c438b30350e03587d21/0_84_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdf28099b1651ad04455971895131434", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
