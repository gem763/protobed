But Facebook lobbied prestige and subscription publishers to provide their news to the section and dangled extra financial incentives to them, sources with direct knowledge said.\n\nIt got many of the biggest names on board \u2014 The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, BuzzFeed, Los Angeles Times, New York Media, and Business Insider are among the publishers participating. Facebook is paying some of them, sources confirmed.\n\nThe New York Times confirmed for the first time it's participating.\n\n\"Facebook is taking a welcome first step toward recognizing the differential value of New York Times journalism,\" The Times said in a statement. \"Facebook News should make quality news easier to find in the Facebook environment and easier to distinguish from other forms of content. Our participation in this new tab will promote Times journalism to Facebook's audience while continuing to direct users to our own destinations, support our digital subscription growth strategy, and increase our ability to invest in our newsroom.\"\n\nRead more: CNN explains why it's pulling its high-performing Anderson Cooper news show off Facebook Watch\n\n'A better environment for news'\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year floated the idea of creating a place for users who want more news. The tech giant has since begun talking to publishers and hiring to support it.\n\nThe section was seen as a way to help Facebook repair its reputation that's been dented by the spread of false and misleading news on its platform. To encourage publishers to provide their news to the section, Facebook made it enticing in several ways.\n\nIt features links back to publishers' sites so they can benefit from traffic and associated ad sales when people click on the links.\n\nFacebook said the section wouldn't replace the news that's in the main feed, so any new traffic that publishers get from the new section will be incremental.\n\nThe top of the section will feature top stories picked by a team of human editors, while other parts will be algorithmically driven.\n\nFacebook also allowed publishers with paywalls to keep their models intact in the new section.\n\n\"This will be a better environment for news,\" Jeff Jarvis, a City University of New York journalism professor who's familiar with the plan, said earlier in the summer.\n\nSome say the Facebook payments put pressure on Google\n\nOn the surface, it makes sense to have a separate tab for news, because while Facebook has cut the amount of news it sends through its News Feed, news still forms part of the conversation ecosystem that Facebook wants to be part of. Facebook has over the years changed strategies to promote and pay for news, and it has said it wants to elevate quality news on the platform but has struggled with how to judge quality.\n\nA lot of publishers are strapped for revenue and welcome any funding as Facebook and Google eat up most of the digital-ad pie.\n\nSome publishers think Facebook's payments will help them step up pressure on other tech companies, especially Google, to get more favorable terms.\n\nThe section comes as the rival platforms Apple and Snap have been increasingly paying publishers to present their content. In fact, about the time Zuckerberg floated the news-tab idea, Apple News launched a subscription program that shares revenue with publishers.\n\nThe new section featuring established news outlets could help Facebook defend against criticism of its problems with misinformation and propaganda spreading on the platform and accusations of ideological bias, from both the left and the right, in the news it promotes in the feed.\n\nFacebook emphasized that it sought to represent a wide array of publishers in Facebook News, covering general, subject-specific, and local outlets, and that it will seek to expand the list over time. Facebook said publishers had to meet other criteria such as its community standards against hate speech. It didn't publicize which ones were being paid.\n\nMost publishers won't get direct payments, though\n\nBut a common criticism is that only a few publishers will get paid and that the payments leave out most of the news ecosystem, especially local newspapers, the most hard-hit sector of the news industry.\n\nDavid Chavern, president and CEO of the News Media Alliance, a trade organization for newspapers, said the initiative was a \"small but awkward start\" but was mostly to the benefit of national news providers, which leaves out most of the news ecosystem.\n\nAlso, by negotiating one by one with publishers and requiring them to sign nondisclosure agreements, Facebook prevents publishers from knowing what the market for their news is, putting them at a disadvantage, he said.\n\n\"It highlights the need for some collective work,\" he said. \"No one is allowed to know what everybody else has gotten.\"\n\nFacebook News has to build a whole new audience\n\nOne big question is whether Facebook can get a meaningful audience to the section in the first place after it struggled to create a strong viewing habit with its Watch video section. An exec who's familiar with the plans said Zuckerberg believed a news tab could draw 15% of Facebook users, which could be huge.\n\nBut Facebook has set expectations low with other publishers, telling them it's unknown how much traffic benefit they'll get, since going to News requires users to change their behavior.\n\nAnd will Facebook keep paying publishers after the three-year terms end?
