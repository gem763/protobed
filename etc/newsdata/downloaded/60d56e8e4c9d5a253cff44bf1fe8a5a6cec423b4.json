The survey of 1,640 registered voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nIn a survey taken last weekend, 49% were opposed and 36% were in favor of impeachment.\n\nAnd by a 49% to 46% margin, Americans said they approve of the House of Representatives\u2019 formally starting an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, according to a separate NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll released on Thursday.\n\nThat survey of 864 adults was taken Wednesday night, after Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s impeachment announcement on Tuesday, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.\n\nDemocrats say the major tipping point in the debate was a whistleblower complaint that touched on a phone conversation Mr. Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July.\n\nThe complaint, made public Thursday, alleges that the president used his power to try to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a top political rival. Mr. Trump has denied the accusations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
