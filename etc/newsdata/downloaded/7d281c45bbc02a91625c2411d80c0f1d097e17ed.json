During the speech, he repeated that Facebook stood for free expression, made vague noises towards its improvement, and pointed out that \u2014 as far as values go \u2014 it\u2019s at least standing against the likes of China.\n\nThere was a theme throughout the speech, linking Facebook communication with major civil rights movements of ages past. Zuckerberg name-dropped the likes of Martin Luther King Jr and Frederick Douglass, and went so far as to call it a \u201cfifth estate alongside other power structures in our society.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg spent the first part of his speech touting the good Facebook had done, and how it\u2019s \u201cdecentralized power by putting it in people\u2019s hands.\u201d Most of his speech attempted to cast Facebook as a bastion of free expression battered by outside forces and critics, and I leave it to my readers to assess how true they think that is.\n\nFacebook, according to Zuckerberg, needs to have more openness when it comes to speech, not less. One of his more notable quotes was, \u201cI don\u2019t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things tech companies judge to be 100 percent true.\u201d He also said the company doesn\u2019t fact-check political ads for this reason, as it isn\u2019t on Facebook to police politicians.\n\n\"I believe that, when it is not absolutely clear what we should do, we should err on the side of greater expression.\" @facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg #ZuckerbergatGU \u2014 McCourt School (@McCourtSchool) October 17, 2019\n\nDespite that, he acknowledged that such openness is dangerous, as it leaves users vulnerable to manipulation. He claimed that the problem wasn\u2019t the speech, but the inauthenticity of the speakers, and that the company was focused on purging bot accounts as soon as they\u2019re created. He didn\u2019t allude to what the company would do about the real people creating these accounts, other than play an ever-escalating game of Whac-a-mole with the bots.\n\nZuckerberg also admitted he\u2019d considered banning all political ads from Facebook, saying the controversy they invited wasn\u2019t worth what little revenue they generated. But he added that this only swung the power in favor of incumbents, as it robbed underdog candidates of a major platform.\n\nHe also alluded to Facebook\u2019s intention to create an independent review board to which users could appeal Facebook\u2019s decisions \u2014 a sort-of social media Supreme Court. Their decisions on whether to overturn Facebook\u2019s own rulings would be absolute. It sounds like a nice idea, provided the right people are on this board. This was only actionable thing Zuckerberg mentioned during the whole speech, and it\u2019s an idea Facebook has floated before.\n\nZuckerberg says he\u2019s creating an \u201cindependent\u201d advisory board he will appoint to oversee his monopoly. It\u2019ll be very independent. He\u2019ll make sure of it. And definitely way better than Congress or the Fed gov\u2019t stepping in and regulating them. Definitely. He promises. \u2014 john r stanton (@dcbigjohn) October 17, 2019\n\nThe speech seemed to take a real turn when Zuckerberg said that one of the problems is that countries with limits on free expressions try to impose those limits on other countries. He specifically namedropped China, a country with which Facebook has often had friction.\n\nHe identified the Chinese vision for the internet as a major threat to freedom of expression, saying, it\u2019s \u201cbuilding its own internet focused on very different values.\u201d Most major platforms have been built on American values (and money). He pointed out that, nowadays, six of the top ten internet platform are Chinese, and directly called out TikTok for censoring mentions of the Hong Kong protests. \u201cIs that the internet we want?\u201d\n\nThis is the only time during the event Zuckerberg actually seemed to be passionate about what he was saying. Everything else he mentioned on stage was Macbeth\u2019s tale told by an idiot: \u201cFull of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\u201d But when he spoke about Facebook as some kind of oak standing sentinel against the encroaching, anti-free expression values of China, you could tell he actually felt what he was saying.\n\nI actually appreciate it when Mark Zuckerberg stands by free speech and not trade away freedom for the Chinese market This is very important to me because I am a Hong Konger and a lot of us read and discuss news through Facebook#FightForFreedomStandWithHongKong \u2014 Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) October 17, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s not entirely wrong to criticize attempts by the Chinese government to infringe on the free expression of people in other countries. For an example of how this is happening in real time, take a look at the NBA Twitter scandal or the Hearthstone kerfuffle. But just because Facebook isn\u2019t one thing doesn\u2019t mean it is something else by default \u2014 in this case an open platform that boosts and protects free expression. The simple act of \u201cnot being in bed with the Chinese\u201d does not address any of the legitimate complaints against the kind of speech Facebook has allowed to proliferate on its platform.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, despite the event ostensibly being about freedom to speak one\u2019s mind, the students weren\u2019t actually permitted to stand up and ask Zuck questions after the show. They submitted questions before the event, which were handpicked and asked by a moderator during the Q&A after the event, said NYT reporter Kara Swisher, who was present. Zuck also wrapped up on a decided saccharine note, saying, \u201cI believe in giving people a voice because, at the end of the day, I believe in people.\u201d It\u2019s a good summing up of the whole speech \u2014 a pleasant sentiment that doesn\u2019t really mean anything when you think about it.\n\nRead next: Nintendo's Switch leads console sales in U.S. for 10th straight month", "description": "Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke at Georgetown University about Facebook's devotion to free expression, and how it's different from China.", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FZuck-Georgtown.jpg&signature=fe5cdf181993df623bde623a1a5ffb05", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
