Tate George, a four-year NBA player in the 1990s before his 2013 real-estate Ponzi scheme conviction, said the Internal Revenue Service fouled him by filing his taxes while he was locked up.\n\nJudge James Halpern wasn\u2019t convinced, writing \u201cthe mere fact that [George] was incarcerated when his return was due is not reasonable cause for his failure to file timely.\u201d\n\nThe IRS correctly determined George had an unpaid tax balance of $28,696 and owed almost $9,000 in additional fees, Halpern said in a decision released earlier last week.\n\nLong before he was dueling with tax authorities, George was a University of Connecticut star player. At school, he heaved a successful buzzer beater in the very last second of a 1990 NCAA Sweet Sixteen round game.\n\nHe went on to play for the then-New Jersey Nets and Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nIn 2012, New Jersey federal prosecutors charged George for leading a Ponzi scheme that bilked victims out of $2.5 million. George was convicted at trial in 2013 and sentenced to a nine-year prison term, along with a $2.5 million restitution order to pay back victims.\n\nGeorge has maintained his innocence and he\u2019s representing himself behind bars in a pending challenge on his case.\n\nIn 2013, the NBA paid George a $208,111 pension distribution, the Tax Court decision noted. When the incarcerated ex-player didn\u2019t file his federal income taxes for that year, IRS officials took it upon themselves to file the return.\n\nAfter all its calculations, the IRS said George had a $28,696 unpaid tax balance, the decision said.\n\nGeorge appealed.\n\nHe said if he had access to all his documents and did his own returns, he might have itemized deductions, which could have been more than the $6,100 standard deduction the\n\nIRS gave him.\n\nGeorge complained that paying the amount would be a hardship for him and his family. He didn\u2019t offer specifics about the alleged hardship, Halpern noted.\n\nGeorge represented himself in the Tax Court case. The 51-year-old is being held at a low-security federal prison in Pennsylvania. He\u2019s scheduled for release in September 2021, prison records show.\n\nAn NBA spokesman declined to comment whether George was still receiving his pension. Player pension information was confidential, the spokesman said.\n\nAn IRS spokesman said \u201cas a general rule, we don\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\u201d", "description": "The IRS did the Tate George\u2019s taxes for him and he didn\u2019t like the outcome.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS245_tate_g_ZG_20190927142608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
