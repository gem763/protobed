Boxing saves, but what about when it takes someone who doesn\u2019t need saving?\n\nTwo days before fight night, Patrick Day walked to the podium for the event\u2019s final press conference. He complimented Chicago, a city he said reminded him of New York, \u201cjust less crowded\u201d. He then remarked that the other fighters looked fit and healthy, and promised an entertaining fight with Charles Conwell. He sounded more like the promoter than one of the participants, a point he addressed.\n\n\u201cPeople look at me, look at my demeanor, and say, \u2018Oh you\u2019re such a nice guy, well-spoken, why do you choose to box?\u2019 It\u2019s about what\u2019s in your heart \u2026 I have a fighter\u2019s soul, a fighter\u2019s spirit, and I love this sport,\u201d Day said. \u201cBoxing makes me happy, that\u2019s why I choose to do it.\u201d\n\nPatrick Day dies aged 27 from injuries sustained in fight against Conwell Read more\n\nIt\u2019s a question that has been repeated in the days that followed, though the tenses have changed. Day lapsed into a coma after being knocked out, less than 100 seconds before the bout\u2019s scheduled conclusion. Emergency brain surgery was performed, but he died Wednesday, four days after the fight, aged 27.\n\nIn a sport where everyone is fighting for a piece of the same pie, Day was the rare example of someone universally well-liked by peer and promoter alike. He had been a standout student at his high school in Freeport, Long Island, and earned his associate\u2019s degree in Nutrition at Nassau Community College, and later obtained his Bachelor\u2019s in Health and Wellness through online classes at Kaplan University (now known as Purdue University Global).\n\nDay, a Haitian-American, was the youngest of four boys. His mother, a translator at the United Nations would never be in attendance when he fought, though his father, a doctor, had been to a few. \u201cIt was a running conversation with us over the years how much his mom did not want him to fight,\u201d said Lou DiBella, who promoted Day through most of his pro career.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kid that, if you had a son, you\u2019d want your son to be like him. If you had a little brother, you\u2019d want your little brother to be like him,\u201d said Joe Quiambao, who worked as the matchmaker for DiBella Entertainment when they signed Day to his first pro contract, and had matched him with his first nine opponents.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Patrick Day, right, holds up his check alongside matchmaker Joe Quiambao after his professional debut in 2013.

He wasn\u2019t like that, he just produced positive vibes all over the place.\u201d\n\nSean Monaghan, a former contender and gym mate who knew Day since he was 14, remembers that Day was always smiling, \u201ca genuine smile\u201d, but that he became a different person once the bell rang.\n\n\u201cHe was the nicest kid you could meet outside the ring but he was pretty nasty inside that ring,\u201d said Monaghan, who had been a constant training partner of Day\u2019s, traveling together to find sparring, and spending days out on the track for grueling workouts.\n\n\u201cWith the connections he made and how well liked he was, he could have walked away from boxing into a nice job, someone would have looked after him. But he was completely determined to become a world champion.\u201d\n\nThat determination was evident since he was a teenaged amateur boxing in the New York Golden Gloves. After a preliminary fight, the 19-year-old told this writer about the anxiety he felt in the ring, but added, \u201cI dreamed about getting in the Gloves and nothing is gonna stop me.\u201d He made it to the finals, but lost a close, 3-2 split-decision. He was given the Gil Clancy Sportsmanship Award, but he wanted more. \u201cI was down, I was going through a depression after I lost in the Golden Gloves finals, I felt so bad because I wanted it,\u201d Day said in 2013, when he was two fights into his pro career. \u201cI didn\u2019t sit around and sulk for too long. I used that for motivation and determination, and I promised myself that I was gonna get gold next time I got in that tournament.\u201d He did just that, unseating the incumbent champion at 152lbs and winning the Sugar Ray Robinson award as the tournament\u2019s best open class boxer. He then went on to win the US nationals, earning the No 1 national ranking in his weight class, and was a 2012 Olympic alternate.\n\nDiBella noticed immediately that he had a different vibe from most of the other fighters.\n\n\u201cHe clearly didn\u2019t need to do it, and if it wasn\u2019t such a passion for him and he wasn\u2019t compelled by whatever lies within his soul to do it, do I think a kid like this would have been better without it? Yeah,\u201d said DiBella, who had previously lost Leavander Johnson, an International Boxing Federation lightweight champion he promoted, to a ring death in 2005.\n\nDiBella says there was a quality about Day which he was immediately drawn to.\n\n\u201cUnlike a lot of kids, his charisma didn\u2019t lay in braggadocio or swag. His charisma was in his approachability and his whole presence. He was just a positive, cool cat,\u201d DiBella said.\n\nRyan Songalia (@ryansongalia) Patrick Day talking about transitioning from the amateurs to the pro ranks, he was 2-0 here. pic.twitter.com/x43CYSpgmu\n\nDay went undefeated in his first 10 pro fights, but suffered a pair of defeats in 2015, after which DiBella released him from his contract. It might have seemed like an opportune time to disembark and move into post-boxing life. Though he\u2019d been designated an \u201copponent\u201d, he never lost the mentality of a winner. He won six straight, facing a level of opposition he often wasn\u2019t expected to beat, and was once again re-signed by DiBella. He was rated in the top 10 by all four major sanctioning bodies after defeating the unbeaten Ismail Iliev in February, but lost to Carlos Adames in a punishing fight this past June.\n\nThe irony of last Saturday\u2019s fight was that, though Conwell was undefeated and a 2016 US Olympian, he hadn\u2019t looked good in his previous fight, a decision win over Courtney Pennington, whom Day had beaten in 2016. He seemed like another one of the prospects whom Day had derailed along the way. Several days after the fight, Conwell penned an emotional open letter, revealing that he had been brought to tears, replaying the fight repeatedly in his head, and that he had considered quitting the sport.\n\n\u201cI never meant for this to happen to you. All I ever wanted to do was win. If I could take it all back I would no one deserves for this to happen to them,\u201d wrote Conwell.\n\nIt was Joe Higgins, the trainer and father figure to Day, who had reached out to Conwell on Twitter, reassuring him that he doesn\u2019t blame Conwell for what happened to Day.\n\n\u201cHe would have wanted you to continue. I\u2019m am rooting for you to reach your dream, the same one he had,\u201d wrote Higgins, a retired firefighter who has dealt with post-traumatic stress after being a first responder on 9/11.\n\nThe dangers of boxing, inherent to its very nature, are often justified by the direction it offers to many wayward youths. Boxing saves, but what about when it takes somebody that didn\u2019t need to be saved?\n\nHiggins, who first taught Day to box in the garage across the street from where Day lived with his family, told The Ring magazine that he plans to remove the ring and punching bags from the Freeport Police Athletic League Gym and convert the space into a fitness gym, one where no one else will be subjected to a blow to the head.\n\nThough Eddie Hearn, who promoted the show on which Day would have his final fight, had only met Day moments before he walked to the podium, he was moved to tears in an interview with the iFL Youtube outlet, remembering someone he\u2019d only known for \u201c30 seconds.\u201d Quiambao, who knew Day much longer, understood why.\n\n\u201cWhether you knew him for a minute, an hour, a day, year, he left that impression on you. After you finish you\u2019re like, \u2018That guy\u2019s gonna be successful and I want him to do good.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Boxing\u2019s dangers are often justified by the direction it offers to many wayward youths.
