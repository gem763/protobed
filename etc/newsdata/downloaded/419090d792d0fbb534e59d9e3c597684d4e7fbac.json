Dorsey said a full policy will be made available to the public on November 15th.\n\n\u201cSome might argue our actions today could favor incumbents,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cBut we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026 \u2014 jack (@jack) October 30, 2019\n\nThe company\u2019s decision comes after weeks of Facebook stumbling over the same issue. Earlier this month, Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign penned letters to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube asking that they refuse to run false or misleading political ads. Biden\u2019s campaign had become the target of a series of ads placed by President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign that made baseless claims regarding the Biden family\u2019s relationship with the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn a response letter obtained by The Verge at the time, Facebook said that it would not be fact-checking claims made by politicians in ads placed on the platform.\n\n\u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s public policy director for global elections, said earlier this month. \u201cThus, when a politician speaks or makes an ad, we do not send it to third party fact checkers.\u201d\n\nTwitter has had some policies in place to keep politicians from making false statements on its platform, but has yet to use them. Earlier this summer, Twitter said that it would gray out tweets from public figures like Trump that violated its rules and restrict users\u2019 abilities to share them, but hasn\u2019t implemented it on any tweets so far.\n\nIn a USA Today op-ed on Tuesday, Facebook doubled-down on its policy to allow candidates to boost misinformation. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t become the gatekeeper of truth on candidate ads,\u201d Harbath and Nell McCarthy, Facebook\u2019s director of policy management, wrote.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free expression,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cThis is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle.\u201d\n\nDorsey\u2019s full statement on the rule change is below (emojis removed):", "description": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has announced that, starting in November, Twitter will no longer accept money for political ads \u2014 a stunning break after Facebook\u2019s recent fact-checking controversies.", "authors": ["Makena Kelly", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2z0nkeOqAbnZqe1cJriMBz4J4Lg=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12645587/acastro_180827_1777_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
