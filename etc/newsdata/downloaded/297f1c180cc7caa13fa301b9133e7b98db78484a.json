However, their equities businesses suffered the most with a 17% decline.\n\nEquities may have further to fall, according to the Financial Times, as stricter investor protection regulations in Europe could mean other banking giants join Deutsche Bank in leaving equities to Wall Street's biggest players.\n\nEarnings from Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and others have missed the mark in recent months.\n\nDeutsche Bank posted a $3.5 billion loss in the second quarter, much wider than the $2.8 billion predicted by Credit Suisse. Morgan Stanley also suffered, with equities-trading revenue down 14% \u2014 the worst of any Wall Street Bank \u2014 and overall sales-and-trading revenue down 12%.\n\nHeadcount in the investment banks also shrunk by 1,500 between January and June, Coalition reported.
