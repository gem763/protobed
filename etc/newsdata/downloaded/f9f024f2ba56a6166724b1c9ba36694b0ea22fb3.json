The assurance that active euthanasia would always be limited to terminally ill, competent adults just never made any sense. Here\u2019s the problem: Once a society widely supports eliminating suffering by eliminating the sufferer and redefines as a \u201cmedical treatment\u201d the act whereby doctors kill seriously ill patients, there is no logical argument for limiting euthanasia to adults with legal decision-making capacity. After all, children suffer too, so how can they be logically refused \u201cmedical aid in dying\u201d \u2014 or MAID, the current euphemism for euthanasia and assisted suicide \u2014 only because of their age?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe short answer, of course, is that they can\u2019t and they won\u2019t be, once a society generally embraces euthanasia consciousness, as is demonstrated by the three countries where lethal-jab euthanasia has been legalized and now has popular support. Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for anyone age twelve and older. In 2014, it eliminated all age restrictions. A recent report published by Belgian authorities reveals that three children were euthanized legally in 2016\u201317 \u2014 the youngest at age nine \u2014 with the two others at ages eleven and 17, respectively. Their maladies? Cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and a brain tumor.\n\nEuthanasia has popular support in the Netherlands as well. There children down to age twelve are permitted to be euthanized, with parental permission required until age 17. Infanticide is also practiced openly by Dutch doctors, even though it is technically illegal. Indeed, the \u201cGroningen Protocol,\u201d a bureaucratic checklist published by Dutch pediatricians, describes which terminally ill and seriously disabled babies can be put down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen these horrors are brought up in euthanasia debates in the United States, assisted-suicide advocates wave off the concern as mere slippery-slope advocacy and sniff that whatever policies Belgium and Netherlands have adopted, those countries are very different culturally from the United States. Now that blithe assurance is poised to become inoperable, as Canada appears on the verge of allowing children to be euthanized.\n\nThe Canadian Supreme Court in 2015 created a right to be euthanized, followed by enabling legislation in the national and provincial parliaments. The law basically guarantees the availability of euthanasia to adults experiencing intractable suffering \u2014 as defined by the patient \u2014 in circumstances where death is reasonably foreseeable. Serious discussions are now underway to expand that license to children. That development is especially alarming for the United States, given that Canada is our closest cultural cousin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Canadian medical establishment has clearly signaled its acquiescence. Earlier this year, the Canadian Paediatric Society issued a position paper entitled \u201cMedical Assistance in Dying: A Paediatric Perspective.\u201d The paper is entirely uncritical of expanding the euthanasia law to include minors. More than that, the statement makes recommendations about how to implement pediatric euthanasia once the law permits. In refusing to oppose legalization or, indeed, to make even one substantive argument against its moral propriety, the society implicitly endorses a policy that would allow sick and disabled children to be killed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMember pediatricians were polled about the question. Only one-third of respondents opposed expanding Canada\u2019s euthanasia law to children in all circumstances. Almost half (46 percent) were in favor of extending the MAID option to \u201cmature minors experiencing progressive illness or intractable pain.\u201d (According to the report, \u201cthe mature minor doctrine recognizes that a patient\u2019s comprehension of the nature and consequences of a treatment has determinants beyond age, and that children\u2019s wishes should be granted degrees of deference that reflect their evolving maturity.\u201d) There\u2019s more: Twenty-nine percent of answering respondents believe in making euthanasia available to mature minors experiencing \u201cintolerable disability,\u201d while 8 percent would even extend the killing to mature minors with \u201cintolerable mental illness as the sole indication\u201d!\n\nSome parents are already open to having their sick children killed. A startling 11.2 percent of those responding to questionnaires reported having already held \u201cexploratory discussions\u201d with parents about killing their seriously ill mature children \u2014 and that\u2019s while child euthanasia remains illegal in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about euthanasia for \u201cnever competent children\u201d? Forty-five respondents reported having received explicit parental requests to euthanize their children. One-half of the requests were for babies under the age of one. Netherlands-style infanticide, here we come. Thirty-two percent of responding doctors said they approved of allowing euthanasia for immature children \u201cin rare situations involving terminal illness or intractable pain, provided that the process was accompanied by significant oversight.\u201d\n\nWhile the paper did not take an explicit position on legalizing child euthanasia, it is not reticent about forcing doctors\u2019 participation once it becomes legal. Even though only 19 percent \u2014 still a startling figure \u2014 of responding doctors stated they would personally euthanize children, the society argued that, on legalization, dissenting doctors would have the ethical obligation to \u201cinform\u201d patients about the euthanasia option and to \u201crefer requesting patients or families appropriately\u201d to doctors known to be willing to do the deed. (In Canada, this is known as an \u201ceffective referral.\u201d An Ontario judge has even ruled that Catholic and other dissenting doctors morally and religiously opposed to euthanasia must so participate in adult euthanasia or get out of medicine. One presumes that the same coercion would apply to pediatricians should pediatric euthanasia become legal.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn contrast to the society\u2019s supportive neutrality (let\u2019s call it) to child euthanasia, in \u201cMedically Assisted Dying in a Paediatric Hospital,\u201d an article in the Journal of Medical Ethics, doctors and bioethicists associated with a children\u2019s hospital in Toronto are positively enthusiastic about expanding the law. Indeed, the authors report, some doctors at the Hospital for Sick Children have already volunteered to euthanize children once that lethal act becomes legal.\n\nThe authors assume that pediatric euthanasia will be soon legalized in Canada, at least for mature minors \u2014 a good bet, as the government has planned legalization as a two-step process, starting with competent adults and then potentially expanding to the legally incompetent. Accordingly, the paper describes the bureaucratic process the hospital plans to implement once minors can be given lethal jabs.\n\nI found this point particularly startling: Doctors will be allowed to euthanize \u201ccapable minors\u201d \u2014 akin to a \u201cmature minor,\u201d as previously described \u2014 without parental consent or even their notification (my italics):\n\nIf . . . a capable [legally underage] patient explicitly indicates that they do not want their family members involved in their decision-making, although healthcare providers may encourage the patient to reconsider and involve their family, ultimately the wishes of capable patients with respect to confidentiality must be respected. If we regard MAID as practically and ethically equivalent to other medical decisions that result in the end of life, then confidentiality regarding MAID should be managed in this same way.\n\nThe paper was not as explicit about doctors euthanizing children who do not have the perceived mental capacity to decide for themselves. But the paper does state that lethal jabs should be considered \u201cpractically and ethically equivalent to other medical practices that result in the end of life.\u201d That means parents would be able to request pediatric euthanasia in the same way they can now order the removal of life support in an ICU.\n\nThe members of the working group are also intent on doing what they can to normalize pediatric euthanasia as a standard part of medical practice, stating, \u201cWe will . . . as an institution, publicly discuss the provision of MAID in an effort to normalise this procedure and reduce social stigma for everyone involved.\u201d Good grief. Sometimes \u201csocial stigma\u201d serves a positive social purpose by preventing immoral acts regardless of legality.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: Countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and now our most culturally aligned nation, Canada, demonstrate that once a society popularly accepts euthanasia, there are no brakes to prevent the steady expansion of the killing license, to include eventually even children and babies \u2014 acts that, until very recently, were universally condemned in the civilized world. Those with eyes to see, let them see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: In an earlier version of this article, the percentage of respondents to a questionnaire who reported that they had held exploratory discussions with parents about medical aid in dying for their seriously ill mature children was misstated.
