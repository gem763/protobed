Matt Dean, R-Dellwood, of bailing out rather than trying to kill the statewide health insurance exchange known as MNsure. Downey claims Dean used his position as chair of the House Health and Human Services committee to \u201cprop up\u201d MNsure by advancing a reinsurance bill last session. The measure provides subsidies aimed at stabilizing the cost of private insurance plans.\n\n\u201cHe could have refused to hear the bill in his committee,\u201d Downey wrote. \u201cHe could have led a charge to vote against passing it on the House floor. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis StarTribune: Minneapolis mayoral candidates talk downtown safety, affordable housing\n\nMinneapolis mayoral candidates traded barbs on issues from public safety to the citywide $15 minimum wage at a forum organized by the downtown business community Thursday, with much of the criticism directed at Mayor Betsy Hodges, who reiterated what she\u2019s accomplished since being elected in 2013.\n\n\u201cI have not jumped to the head of the parade and pretended I\u2019ve been leading it the whole time,\u201d she said.\n\nHodges is facing challenges from Council Member Jacob Frey, DFL state Rep. Ray Dehn, Nekima Levy-Pounds, Tom Hoch and Aswar Rahman, among others. About 100 members of the local business community attended the forum, filling a conference room at the downtown Radisson Blu hotel.\n\nModerator Tom Hauser, a political reporter for KSTP-TV, kicked off the hourlong forum with a question about public safety and crime downtown \u2014 an issue that\u2019s become central to the race. As with other topics, including affordable housing and the bid for Amazon\u2019s new headquarters, candidates largely agreed on fundamentals but differed on specifics.\n\nMinnesota Post: For some Minnesota counties, climate change may bring economic benefits\n\nScientists predict places like Texas and Florida will be bracing for more hurricanes like Harvey and Irma as the earth heats up in the coming years, and that rising temps and extreme weather events will cost those states\u2019 economies.\n\nMinnesota, not as much. According to a new study from an interdisciplinary team of researchers, Minnesota and other parts of the country, especially the upper Midwest, Northeast and West actually stand to benefit from climate change. At least in some ways.\n\nThe study, published in Science this summer, is the first to estimate the effects of climate change on multiple sectors at the county level, said Amir Jina, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris School of Public Policy and a co-author of the report. The researchers assumed a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario \u2014 what Jina described as \u201cthe world if we don\u2019t adhere to the Paris Agreement, but don\u2019t get too much worse in terms of what we\u2019re doing\u201d \u2014 and projected the effects of climate change out to around the end of the current century, 2080-99.\n\nWhat they found surprised even them. While people often talk about how the world\u2019s poorest countries will be disproportionately hurt by climate change, Jina and his colleagues found the same patterns across counties in the U.S., with the poorest third of counties, many of them in southern states, projected to experience much larger income losses by the end of the century than their wealthier counterparts, largely in the Northwest, upper Midwest and Northeast.", "description": "Minnesota Public Radio:\u00a0MN GOP candidates feud over health insurance\nAn unusually .09/02/2019 3:21:13AM EST.", "authors": ["Watchdog News", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
