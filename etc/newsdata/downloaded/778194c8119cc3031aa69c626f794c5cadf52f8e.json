Even those who manage to invest directly are oftentimes challenged with a lot of administrative burdens. Real estate is also known to be relatively illiquid, meaning that your capital could, in theory, stay locked for a more extended period.\n\nThere have been quite a few initial coin offerings (ICOs) of projects which fail to place enough professional experience required to realize the material return on the investments. A lot of them offer stakes in commercial buildings and hotels. However, the reality is that in a lot of the cases, the amount of capital that\u2019s raised would only cover a portion of the proposed investments.\n\nThis is supposedly where MilCoin steps into the picture. Boasting a promising business model, the project aims to revolutionize real estate investment in Latin America.\n\nWhat is MilCoin?\n\nThe MilCoin Network is intended to be a world leader when it comes to acquisition, preservation, as well as the development of both real estate and entertainment media assets. The project\u2019s mission is to create a model for sustainable land usage and business practices which would also stimulate tourism development and community growth.\n\nThe key to the project\u2019s business model is the acquisition of a large volume of debt-free real estate assets which would produce income. They would also secure the value of each MilCoin token, but more on that later.\n\nMilCoin\u2019s Real Estate Portfolio\n\nThe project\u2019s real estate portfolio has hundreds of properties in areas that contain exploitable natural and mineral resources in the state of Baja California. Under the careful direction of LatAm Save The World, the team will perform extraction methods to reap the benefits of the land in a manner that is environmentally friendly.\n\nThe entire region of Baja California is known for having very favorable geological conditions for non-metallic and metallic mineral deposits, which include gold, silver, copper, iron, silica sand, limestone, and so forth. These are largely used in the construction industry, which offers the MilCoin Network a fairly wide range of extraction opportunities and industrialization of said minerals.\n\nAdditionally, MilCoin Network is going to acquire intellectual property rights by purchasing digital libraries while also enhancing and restoring international films in the public domain. This will allow it to produce entirely original content which will be accessible on the project\u2019s proprietary streaming media platform.\n\nName Hardcap Milcoin Hardcap $30.0 M More Infromation\n\nAbout The MilCoin Token\n\nFirst things first, the MIL token is a securitized ERC-20 based Ethereum asset, which is intended to facilitate a rewarding member experience through various products and services. Besides, the token will be used for membership subscriptions, as well as affiliate referral payouts.\n\nThe team claims that each MIL token is going to be secured by land value which ranges from $833,000 to $5.5 million and shares in multiple operational businesses.\n\nAbout MilCoin\u2019s ICO\n\nMilCoin Network\u2019s ICO started on September 9th this year, and it\u2019s going to last until September 9th, 2020. The hard cap is set to $30 million and people can invest in both ETH and USD.\n\nThe token which is being sold carries the MIL ticker, and it\u2019s based on the ERC-20 standard.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s Whitepaper, 97% of the ICO proceeds are going to be used to purchase the real estate portfolio which comprises 10 million hectares and about 3,000 kilometers of beach-front property in Mexico and Latin America. This is also what\u2019s going to collateralize the value of MIL.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn general, the project is very ambitious and it intends to introduce a network comprised of numerous aspects that offer a nice diversification. Unlike most projects of the kind which focus solely on real estate, MilCoin\u2019s network adds entertainment media assets which are generally in high demand.\n\nThe business path MilCoin Network has chosen is undoubtedly challenging to achieve, mainly because the success of the project depends on the ICO itself. At the same time, even though the MIL token is supposedly collateralized, this collateral will only come when and if the project acquires its portfolio assets.\n\nPros:\n\nAmbitious goals and innovative idea\n\nA variety of intended assets which bring serious versatility\n\nA coherent and well-written Whitepaper with a lot of valuable information\n\nCons:\n\nThe project is very dependent on its ICO\n\nThe tokens will only be collateralized if and when the team acquires its portfolio assets\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "Featured Real estate is undoubtedly a reasonably tricky asset class to access.
