USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 If Vice President Mike Pence doesn\u2019t comply with House Democrats\u2019 request to turn over by Tuesday documents related to the Trump administration\u2019s actions on Ukraine, Democrats have said that refusal can be used as evidence to impeach the president.\n\nPence, himself, could also face repercussions.\n\nThose range from a more probable next step \u2013 the denial becomes part of the larger battle between Democrats and the administration \u2013 to the most extreme route that experts say Democrats are unlikely to pursue: Pence is also impeached.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see him as the target,\u201d said Stuart M. Gerson, one of 16 conservative lawyers who released a statement last week in support of an \u201cexpeditious impeachment investigation.\u201d \u201cThat creates a political issue that one would assume the Congress is smart enough to avoid.\u201d\n\nInstead, Gerson and other legal experts expect Pence to be treated like other officials in Democrats\u2019 efforts to investigate whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to get the newly-elected president to investigate the Biden family.\n\nDemocrats have subpoenaed a variety of people inside and outside of the administration, including giving acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney an Oct. 18 deadline to comply with a large documents request.\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, testified under subpoena Friday after the administration ordered her not to appear before the House investigatory committees voluntarily. U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland has said he will testify under subpoena on Thursday.\n\nKey testimony: US Ambassador to EU Gordon Sondland, key impeachment witness, will testify\n\nTrump and his team have told Democrats the White House will not provide documents or witnesses to House impeachment investigators because it considers their investigation to be unfair and illegitimate. Among their criticisms is the fact that the House has not formally voted to begin impeachment proceedings, a move that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has argued is not required.\n\nPeter J. Wallison, who served as White House counsel to President Ronald Reagan, predicted the courts will view the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as a political fight and not enforce any subpoenas.\n\n\u201cOn the merits, I think the administration has it right, not to comply with requests for documents and testimony until the House actually adopts a resolution of impeachment,\u201d Wallison said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it has been done in the past, and is the only sensible way for this to proceed.\u201d\n\nConstitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who has participated in prior impeachment cases, said Pelosi\u2019s refusal so far to hold a House vote on impeachment, weakens Democrats\u2019 legal argument but is not fatal.\n\n\u201cThe court may not be confident as to why the House is pursuing this information when the speaker has steadfastly declined to hold a vote of the body,\u201d said Turley, who was the lead counsel in the last Senate impeachment trial of a federal judge in 2010 and testified at the impeachment hearings of President Bill Clinton. \u201cThe odds still favor Congress regardless. But it may take more time.\u201d\n\nTrump has accused Democrats of trying to take him out by \u201ccoup.\u201d If Trump were impeached by the Democratic-controlled House and removed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Pence would become president, keeping Republicans in control of the executive branch.\n\nIf both Trump and Pence were to be removed, however, Pelosi would become president.\n\nWhile vice presidents can also be impeached, Pence\u2019s operating theory may be that he\u2019s protected because Pelosi is the next in succession, said Julian Epstein, who was the chief counsel for House Judiciary Committee Democrats during Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of truth to that,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cBut I\u2019d be very careful if I were him. Certainly, if he\u2019s not physically impeached, he can be reputationally impeached. This can be a definite career-ender for him.\"\n\nEpstein said Pence should find back channels to signal that he wants to be as cooperative as he can be within the strictures of executive privilege.\n\nPence told reporters last week that he has no problem with the White House releasing transcripts of his conversations with the Ukrainian president, something he said White House lawyers are reviewing.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, left, shakes hands with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, in Warsaw, Poland on Sept. 1, 2019. A Washinton Post article published on Oct. 2, 2019 reported President Donald Trump used Pence in his attempt to pressure the new Ukrainian president to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, but is not conclusive on how much Pence knew about Trump's efforts. (Photo: Petr David Josek, AP)\n\nDemocrats have requested a variety of material from Pence, including those relating to his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in early September and a call a few weeks later.\n\nIf Pence doesn\u2019t comply, the House can vote to hold him in contempt. The House sergeant-at-arms could then take him into custody, a highly unlikely outcome.\n\n\u201cCan you see the sergeant-at-arms showing up and meeting the FBI?\u201d Gerson said. \u201cI doubt that that\u2019s the scenario.\u201d\n\nBeing in contempt of Congress is also a federal misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and a year a prison. But the House would have to rely on Trump's Justice Department to prosecute Pence.\n\nThe third option for Democrats is asking the courts to uphold a subpoena. If he declines, then he\u2019s not just defying the House, but defying the courts, said constitutional scholar Frank O. Bowman, III, author of \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court has its own mechanisms to deal with people who've done that \u2013 fines, jailing, all sorts of things, which would certainly be an awkward kind of thing to happen to a vice president,\u201d Bowman said.\n\nPence\u2019s most obvious legal defense for not complying would be claiming executive privilege, the right of the president and high-level executive branch officials to withhold information.\n\nIf a battle with the White House comes down to that, past precedents and judicial decisions make it clear that in cases of credible allegations of wrongdoing, an executive privilege claim is overridden by the need to determine any violations of law or the Constitution, said Mark J. Rozell, an expert on executive privilege at George Mason University.\n\nRozell said that when he first wrote his book on executive privilege in the 1990s, he could have said with confidence that the precedent would hold.\n\nBut, he added: \"It is hard to say what the current court might determine, if things got that far.\u201d\n\nText messages: Read key text messages between diplomats on Trump, Ukraine president\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/14/impeachment-vice-president-pence-faces-deadline-provide-documents/3947297002/", "description": "What happens to Vice President Mike Pence if he doesn't meet Tuesday's deadline to give Democrats documents for their impeachment inquiry?", "authors": ["Maureen Groppe", "Published A.M.
