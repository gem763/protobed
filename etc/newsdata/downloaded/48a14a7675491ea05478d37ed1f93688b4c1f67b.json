(Callaghan O'Hare/Bloomberg)\n\nDemocracyPost contributor\n\nIn 1874, Ulysses S. Grant was president. Levi Strauss received a patent for blue jeans the year before. New York City annexed the Bronx. And the Universal Postal Union was formed, facilitating the exchange of mail across international borders.\n\nThat treaty, which turned 145 in July, is now under attack by President Trump, who has threatened to withdraw from it. If he follows through, the consequences could be disruptive for American businesses, which are already getting hammered by new frictions in international exchange created by Trump\u2019s tariffs. But the consequences would also be potentially dire for overseas citizens who would have a harder \u2014 and costlier \u2014 time casting their ballot in American elections.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably never heard of the Universal Postal Union. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be. It\u2019s an invisible force that allows you to seamlessly receive a letter from Madagascar or a package shipped by a Chinese company.\n\nBut those Chinese companies have been getting a bit of a sweetheart deal. Since 1969, China and other poorer countries have been charged lower rates for shipping internationally than richer countries. In effect, those fixed rates have created a system in which Chinese companies can sometimes send parcels that weigh 4.4 pounds or less to the United States for a lower cost than American companies would pay to ship domestically. If that seems unfair to you, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has lashed out against the UPU. Last year, the White House formally began the process to withdraw from the treaty. And, for once, Trump has a point: The treaty should be amended to reflect China\u2019s position as an emerging superpower rather than the impoverished backwater it once was. In 1969, China\u2019s GDP per capita was around $100; today it\u2019s nearly $10,000.\n\nThe UPU \u2014 with representatives from its 192 member states \u2014 is holding an Extraordinary Congress this month in Geneva. On the table is an American-led proposal to allow member countries to set their own shipping rates, which would likely see the United States unilaterally increase shipping rates on China. That could spark tit-for-tat retaliation, as with the tariffs. In effect, it would open a new front in the trade war using the postal system \u2014 an economic conflict that the UPU was partially designed to prevent. But if the Extraordinary Congress ends without a deal, Trump\u2019s administration has said that the United States will unilaterally withdraw.\n\nAs is often the case with Trumpian policy, there would be massive unintended consequences of that withdrawal \u2014 and not just for businesses that rely on international shipping. The threat of withdrawal alone is already creating a headache for election officials who are preparing to send out ballots to voters (including soldiers) who are overseas.\n\nIn Kentucky, for example, the deadline for sending ballots abroad for state and local elections this November falls before the UPU Congress meets in Geneva. As a result, Kentucky elections director Jared Dearing has voiced concerns that overseas voters will be given incorrect information about how to return their ballots, which, in the best-case scenario, could end up costing voters quite a bit of money to mail their ballots home. In the worst-case scenario, it could lead to thousands of votes left uncounted.\n\n\u201cMilitary and overseas citizens already face enormous hurdles casting their votes,\u201d Matthew Weil, director of the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Elections Project, told me. \u201cThese citizens may be forced to pay up to $70 to return their ballots via private shipping companies, and it\u2019s not clear all states will accept ballots delivered this way.\u201d\n\nIn the 2018 midterms, more than 350,000 overseas civilians and military personnel voted from abroad, with the majority using postal ballots, so a significant number of potential voters would be affected.\n\nThe economic consequences could also be disastrous, significantly raising the costs of doing business with American companies. That\u2019s why many experts believe that Trump\u2019s threat to withdraw is little more than bluster aimed at securing concessions.\n\nBut many experts also believed that Trump wouldn\u2019t follow through on leaving the Paris climate accord or trashing the Iran nuclear deal. As with those blunders, Trump\u2019s approach to the UPU is startlingly slapdash. Rather than courting European allies who also have legitimate beefs with the UPU\u2019s current rates, the White House is yet again going it alone, making the gambit less likely to succeed. And if Trump follows through on his threat to leave the postal union, the U.S. government will have to begin the long slog of bilateral negotiations with the 191 other member states, a massive waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn many ways, then, the White House\u2019s latest gamble with the economy is a quintessentially Trumpian move: a bold threat to walk away from a multilateral agreement that works pretty well, while ignoring the unintended consequences that could hurt American business, alienate allies and cause collateral damage to democracy. The best way to put America First is to return to negotiations with a more powerful hand once he\u2019s brought key allies aboard. Otherwise, his dangerous brinkmanship will create more drag on an already flagging economy and could even cost soldiers their right to vote.\n\nRead more:\n\nGeorge F.
