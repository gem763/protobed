Nation pulls plug on airing games, celebrities boycott", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nChina will not air two preseason NBA games scheduled in China this week on TV and the Internet after NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s latest comments in Tokyo showing unwavering support for free speech and the growing rift between the league and China.\n\nThere is concern the two games between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers will be cancelled, a person in China with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive situation.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Silver tried to clarify the NBA\u2019s stance, saying, \u201cIt is inevitable that people around the world \u2013 including from America and China \u2013 will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\n\n\u201cHowever, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nOPINION: LeBron James needs to exercise free speech on China\n\nOPINION: NBA commissioner has no winning play for China crisis\n\nIn addition to not airing the games, Chinese actors, musicians and celebrities have withdrawn from NBA-related events, and a Nets\u2019 scheduled visit to a school in China has been cancelled.\n\nThe rift between China and the NBA that began over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet showing support for pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong continues to grow, leaving the NBA in a sudden and escalating geopolitical crisis just before the start of the 2019-20 season.\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta tried to distance the team and the league from Morey's tweet with a strong rebuke saying Morey doesn't speak for the team or the league, and Rockets star James Harden offered an apology to China during a press conference on Monday.\n\nThe NBA tried to apologize to China for Morey\u2019s tweet in a statement on Sunday, but two versions of the statement \u2013 one in English and one in Chinese \u2013 left more confusion. Multiple U.S. presidential candidates and senators slammed the initial statement Silver and the NBA were criticized for appearing to choose profit over freedom.\n\n\"I understand that there are consequences from that exercise of, in essence, his freedom of speech. We will have to live with those consequences,\" Silver told reporters in Tokyo.\n\nHe is Tokyo for two preseason games between Houston and Toronto, and he is expected to be in China later this week.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver speaks at a news conference before an NBA preseason basketball game between the Houston Rockets and the Toronto Raptors in Saitama, near Tokyo (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBefore meeting with reporters, Silver tried to clear up any discrepancies with his lengthy statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI recognize our initial statement left people angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the NBA stands for. Let me be more clear,\u201d Silver\u2019s statement began.\n\n\u201cOver the last three decades, the NBA has developed a great affinity for the people of China. We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we recognize that our two countries have different political systems and beliefs. And like many global brands, we bring our business to places with different political systems around the world.\n\n\u201cBut for those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business.\n\n\u201cValues of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2013 and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "After NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a second statement Tuesday underlining the league's stance on free speech, unrest in China grows.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published A.M.
