His report includes plenty of material on Trump\u2019s Oval Office meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak the day after Comey\u2019s firing, including Trump\u2019s comments that, \u201cI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\u201d And it includes detail about Trump\u2019s exchange with an apparently concerned White House Counsel Don McGahn following the meeting. But there is nothing in the report about any comment by Trump informing the Russian delegation that he did not care about election interference. And there are no redactions in this section whatsoever where such information might be hiding\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t know for sure that Mueller never learned of this information, but I know his investigation began without it, and I know what is obvious to everyone who has read his report: that it plays no role in his analysis of collusion. This raises a significant question to me about the completeness of the Mueller\u2019s collusion analysis.", "description": "", "authors": ["Benjamin Wittes", "Lawfareblog.Com Collusion-After-Fact"], "top_image": ""}
