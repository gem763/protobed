We parted as friends. And then, only a few days later, the tragedy happened.\n\n'I was in the car when someone called me checking if I had heard the news. When I asked him what he was talking about he was actually scared to say because he knew what my reaction would be. I went mad. My head was on fire. I started punching the seat, smacking it.\n\n'The driver was asking me if I was okay, and I just shouted: \"No, no, I'm not okay.\" I couldn't really believe it. I just wanted to be alone. He stopped the car, I got out and just walked. I don't know where.\n\nTiote made more than 150 appearances for Newcastle before joining Beijing Enterprises\n\n'I'm Muslim. The only thing I could do was pray for my friend, and for his family, the kids. I'm always in contact with them back in Senegal now. It was very, very sad what happened.\n\n'Tiote had helped me so much, and I respect this guy. For me, he was a giant. He was my brother. He will always be my brother. I miss him so much.'\n\nThe pair played with each other for four years between 2012-16 at St James' Park, with them both becoming fan favourites for the Premier League outfit.", "description": "Tiote, who made more than 150 appearances for Newcastle, passed away at the tender age of 30 after suffering a heart attack in training with new club Beijing Enterprises in China back in June 2017.", "authors": ["Jonathan Spencer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/13/19692218-0-image-a-8_1571056285171.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
