Researchers think one of these refuges, name Wrangel Island, became the last mammoth hold-out; these tusked giants outlived their North American and European counterparts by some 7,000 years before going abruptly extinct.\n\nThat means mammoths as a species lasted far longer than scientists previously thought. When the last woolly mammoth kicked the bucket, the Great Pyramid of Giza had already been built in Egypt.\n\nAccording to a new study, published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, the Wrangel Island inhabitants didn't die of the same causes as other mammoths. Rather, the study authors argue, the isolated animals started to inbreed, which weakened their genetic diversity. The weakened population was then unable to adapt to extreme weather events, which likely caused their sudden, untimely demise.\n\nRead More: Scientists think they finally know why the last woolly mammoths died out\n\nwrangel island More\n\nPatr\u00edcia Pe\u010dnerov\u00e1\n\nA mysterious, 'fairly abrupt' extinction\n\nWrangel Island is about 86 miles northeast of Chukotka, Siberia, a 3,000 square-mile chunk of land in the Chuckchi Sea that broke off from Asia about 10,000 years ago. The population of mammoths that went along for the ride were seemingly spared the global extinction of their species, until about 4,000 years ago when they all disappeared.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of skeletons from Wrangel Island showed that the mammoth population's extinction was \"fairly abrupt\" without any warning signs, according to the study authors.\n\nBut the reason behind this sudden die-off wasn't clear.\n\nA previous study found that the mammoth inhabitants on the other similarly isolated island of St. Paul perished from environmental factors. That island, about 1,000 miles to the south of Wrangel Island in the heart of the Bering Sea, was only 42 square miles in size. By examining fossilized DNA, pollen, and spores, scientists discovered that the St. Paul mammoths had likely run out of fresh water as their tiny island dried up, before finally going extinct 5,600 years ago.\n\nThat story was reflected in the composition of the St. Paul mammoths' bones, which showed drops in certain types of elements just before the creatures went extinct.\n\nmammoth More", "description": "The last of the woolly mammoths died on an Arctic island 4,000 years ago, meaning these animals went extinct much later than scientists once thought.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GrzhNEFsdQxe3khNayb1zA--~B/aD0xMjQwO3c9MTY1MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/3830fff6096687b1d96a58aaca1f1526", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
