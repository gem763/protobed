Protect the identities and safety of those now coming forward.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says that \"like every American,\" he deserves to meet his accuser (\"the so-called 'Whistleblower' \") from the intelligence community. Compared with his earlier statement calling the anonymous whistleblower \u201calmost a spy\u201d and making a thinly veiled reference to execution, the president\u2019s most recent request seems tame \u2014 almost reasonable.\n\nIn fact, it is anything but. As an attorney who represents courageous individuals who come forward to report fraud in a range of industries, I know just how essential confidentiality is to guarding the safety of whistleblowers and the integrity of the reporting process, and just how dangerous a precedent revealing the whistleblower\u2019s identity could set.\n\nThe president is not entitled to \u201cmeet my accuser\u201d any more than the general public is entitled to rule on the whistleblower\u2019s credibility.\n\nRetaliation and intimidation risks\n\nAs more information emerges on Trump's attempts to get Ukraine to do political favors for him, that notion seems to be up for debate even outside Trump's Twitter account. The New York Times, ignoring the chilling effect on future whistleblowers, revealed details about this whistleblower's employment history.\n\nWhen faced with a backlash, Executive Editor Dean Baquet responded that \u201cthe president himself has called the whistleblower\u2019s account a \u2018political hack job,\u2019 \u201d so the Times \u201cwanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.\u201d Others have echoed the idea that revealing details about the whistleblower would somehow add to the credibility of his accusations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on October 4, 2019.

Revealing details about the national security whistleblower\u2019s employment history will not further inform the public or help the government determine whether his allegations are credible. The identity of the whistleblower has nothing to do with the credibility of his information.\n\nConsider the various programs that reward and protect whistleblowers who come forward with evidence of fraud in matters involving government agencies. These programs explicitly account for the vulnerability of the person reporting the fraud. Whistleblowers risk retaliation and intimidation, both from within their company and from other potential employers who might blacklist them \u2014 especially when they report misconduct at high levels of an organization.\n\nNobody gets to 'face' their accuser\n\nMaintaining confidentiality is a crucial to protecting whistleblowers from threats to their safety and from being ostracized. It is also a way to ensure that potential whistleblowers are not discouraged by these risks and to incentivize them to come forward.\n\nFor this reason, the majority of federal whistleblower programs allow people to file reports of fraud under seal. The whistleblower\u2019s confidentiality is preserved even as the government investigates the claim.\n\nHow Democrats should impeach Trump: A searing constitutional duty, a plan from two realists\n\nAt no time during the government\u2019s investigation into a company or individuals accused of wrongdoing is the target of the investigation entitled or allowed to \u201cface\u201d the accuser. Nor is the whistleblower allowed to discuss the matter with anyone other than his or her attorney.\n\nAs part of its investigation, the government may confidentially interview the whistleblower, interview other witnesses or try to corroborate the report with other evidence. The emphasis throughout the investigation is on the credibility of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations, rather than the identity of the person reporting wrongdoing.\n\nFocus on identity is meant to distract\n\nIntelligence community whistleblowers are in an especially precarious position. They have far fewer retaliation and safety protections than private sector whistleblowers. And the heightened media attention often makes them more vulnerable to threats from members of the public.\n\nCase in point: Two Trump supporters offered a $50,000 reward to anyone who could provide further details of the whistleblower\u2019s identity. As a result, the whistleblower\u2019s lawyer reported that his client feared for his safety.\n\nKeep the priorities straight: Pay attention to what Ukraine whistleblower reported, not motivations for speaking out\n\nI know from experience that obsession with the identity of the whistleblower rather than the evidence supporting the allegations is a common tactic used by those accused of fraud. De-emphasizing the national security whistleblower\u2019s identity and focusing on the evidence that results from his information should be our collective priority.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee is now investigating a federal whistleblower's report of improper influence at the Treasury Department in connection with a mandatory audit of Trump's taxes, and other intelligence officials are coming forward on the Ukraine allegations. We need to show these and future whistleblowers that we can get this right.\n\nDebating the merits of revealing the national security whistleblower\u2019s identity distracts from the investigation and the evidence it develops. That plays right into the hands of those seeking to detract from the gravity of the accusations against the president.\n\nWe should not fall into this trap.\n\nNoelle Yasso is a whistleblower attorney at Constantine Cannon.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
