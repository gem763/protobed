The New Jersey-based school adds to a list that includes the University of Virginia and University of Pennsylvania, which have also sold so-called century bonds in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThe market presented UVA with a historic opportunity,\u201d said Jennifer Wagner Davis, the school\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer.\n\nAlong with UVA, borrowers including Apple Inc., Deere & Co. and Walt Disney Co. have recently sought to secure historically low rates. The sales are occurring as fears of a global economic slowdown have driven bond yields around the world to near-record lows and made it cheaper for states, local governments and higher-education institutions to borrow.\n\nAdding to the urgency for issuers: The lows in bond yields may already have passed. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, for example, has jumped by around a quarter percentage point in recent days.\n\nStill, there is more than $15 trillion of negative-yielding debt around the world.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that the U.S. was \u201cvery seriously considering\u201d issuing a 50-year Treasury bond, and analysts and investors have wondered why more governments aren\u2019t taking advantage of low rates to issue bonds that mature in 100 years.\n\nMeanwhile, more money has flown into municipal-bond funds this year through August than since at least 1992, according to data from Refinitiv.\n\n\u201cWith Treasury yields falling so low, the world-wide demand for municipals is just unbelievable,\u201d said Jeff Burger, a portfolio manager at Mellon Investments Corp.\n\nAs a result, municipalities are jumping to meet the demand for their bonds, which investors often prize for their stable income and typically tax-exempt interest payments. Tax-exempt muni-bond issuance has risen 5% year-to-date from the same time last year, according to the latest available data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, while taxable municipal-bond issuance has jumped 34%.\n\nUniversities are getting into the act too. The recent sales put issuance of municipal century bonds on track to hit the highest level in five years. Total century-bond issuance this year is headed toward about $1.3 billion through early September, according to estimates from research firm Municipal Market Analytics. All century-bond issuers this year have been universities, according to MMA. That is a rebound after issuers sold no century bonds last year, and slated to be the most since 2014\u2019s $1.6 billion.\n\nLower and Lower University of Virginia recently landed historically low borrowing costs for a higher education institution's century bond. 6% yield MIT Ohio Univ USC Georgetown Tufts 5 Hamilton UC UC CalTech Wesleyan Bowdoin Penn MIT CalTech UVA 4 MIT UPenn UVA 3 U.S. 30 year treasury 2 \u201919 \u201918 \u201917 \u201916 \u201915 \u201914 \u201913 \u201912 2011 6% yield MIT Ohio Univ USC Georgetown Tufts 5 Hamilton UC UC CalTech Wesleyan Bowdoin Penn MIT UVA CalTech 4 MIT UPenn UVA 3 U.S. 30 year treasury 2 2011 \u201919 \u201918 \u201917 \u201916 \u201915 \u201914 \u201913 \u201912 6% yield MIT Ohio Univ USC Georgetown Tufts 5 Hamilton UC UC CalTech Wesleyan Bowdoin MIT Penn UVA CalTech 4 MIT UPenn UVA 3 U.S. 30 year treasury 2 \u201913 \u201915 \u201912 \u201916 \u201917 2011 \u201919 \u201918 \u201914 6% yield MIT Ohio Univ USC Georgetown Tufts 5 Hamilton UC UC CalTech Wesleyan Bowdoin MIT Penn CalTech UVA 4 MIT UPenn UVA 3 U.S. 30 year treasury 2 \u201918 \u201914 \u201917 \u201915 \u201919 2011 \u201913 \u201916 \u201912\n\n\u201cOur borrowing costs beat our expectations,\u201d said MaryFrances McCourt, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s vice president of finance and treasurer, adding that the all-in interest costs on the century bond were about half a percentage point lower than the university anticipated. \u201cWe were thrilled.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, UVA moved up the timing of its century bond offering by approximately two months in anticipation of heavy demand from investors, issuing $350 million in taxable debt to pay for academic facilities such as a chemistry lab, a student wellness center and dormitories, Ms. Wagner Davis said.\n\nThe university landed the lowest interest rates for a higher education institution\u2019s century bond on record as of last week, with interest costs of about 3.3%, she said. That is almost a percentage point lower than its borrowing costs when it issued a century bond in 2017.\n\nFalling bond yields have spurred unusual movements in the municipal market, some of which have mimicked the Treasury market. For example, shorter-term bond yields hovered higher than longer-term municipal bond yields for the first time in August, according to Daniel Berger, a senior market strategist at Refinitiv\u2019s Municipal Market Data.\n\nThe University of Virginia issued $350 million in taxable debt to pay for academic facilities such as a chemistry lab, a student wellness center and dormitories.

The 2017 tax overhaul limited the ability of state and local governments to sell tax-free debt to refinance old bonds through so-called advanced refundings. But borrowers are swapping out tax-exempt debt for taxable debt and still saving money.\n\nTraditionally, yields on tax-exempt debt are lower than those on taxable bonds. But rates are so low that borrowers are able to issue taxable debt and still save money, analysts said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange moment that makes this available but it makes perfect economic sense,\u201d said Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley .\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Would you invest in a century bond given the current state of the economy? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nMiami-Dade County, Fla., sold almost $400 million in bonds in August for Miami International Airport. Swapping old debt for taxable debt saved money, said Sergio San Miguel, Miami-Dade Aviation Department\u2019s chief financial officer through a spokesman. As a result, the county can borrow more to make improvements to the airport.\n\nBankers and analysts said they are expecting issuance to remain strong in coming months. Jim Costello, a managing director at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said more universities are looking at century bond issuances and advanced refundings.\n\n\u201cMost universities are considering their financing options in the bond market given the low interest rate environment,\u201d said Mr. Costello.\n\nBut some investors are wondering how low yields on municipal debt can fall before the bonds lose their luster. The yield on the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index recently declined to its lowest level since 2016, FactSet data show. The yield on the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond High Yield Index hit a record low in August.\n\n\u201cThe flows going into munis are getting extremely strong,\u201d said George Rusnak, co-head of fixed-income strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cIf it continues down this path, we could see bumpy times ahead.\u201d\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com", "description": "State and local governments, along with universities, are joining companies in a dash to issue debt and lock in low rates, sometimes for up to 100 years.", "authors": ["Gunjan Banerji", "Gunjan.Banerji Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105827/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
