He was really positive. He was kind, caring, loving, wicked sense of humour. He would make a joke about anything and was very quick-witted.\n\n\u2018As a teacher he would have done anything for his students. He would have done anything for his family. He was just a really positive person who would have done anything for anybody.\n\n\u2018He loved his sport. He would go to the gym, he loved being outside and walking. He liked cycling. He was careful about what he ate.\n\n\u2018Everything the doctors warn you about, he didn\u2019t do. He didn\u2019t drink, he didn\u2019t smoke, he had a good diet, he exercised.\n\n\u2018He always put sun cream on because he was paranoid he might catch skin cancer or something.\n\n\u2018He did everything he could to try and prevent anything from happening to him. As the doctors said there was nothing he could have done to prevent this.\u2019\n\nAbi said Matt \u2018did everything he could to try and prevent anything from happening to him\u2019 (Picture: Kennedy News/Total Wedding Photography)\n\nBut cruelly \u2018the doctors said there was nothing he could have done\u2019 to prevent his diagnosis (Picture: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nMatt first started mentioning his tiredness on July 6, and Abi told him to go to the doctor after he started vomiting to the point of being unable to keep ice cubes down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter visiting his GP and being referred to hospital, he was told he had gastroenteritis or constipation, but it wasn\u2019t until he returned for a second time that they did a blood test.\n\nAbi, also a teacher, said: \u2018Obviously I wish it was spotted sooner. I don\u2019t feel any anger towards to the hospital. I genuinely believe they did everything they could for him.\u2019\n\nShe now wants others complaining of similar symptoms to be \u2018persistent\u2019 in demanding a blood test.\n\n\u2018You know your own body,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018If you\u2019ve got it for days and it\u2019s not getting any better, if you\u2019re in any doubt, get it checked. We didn\u2019t know what the symptoms were.\n\n\u2018The only one I knew was bruising, but Matt didn\u2019t have any bruises until he was in hospital.\n\n\u2018So the one thing I knew wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t realise about the night sweats, fatigue or heavy breathing.\n\n\u2018We never expected it would be that. We had thought worst case scenario it was gallstones or an impacted bowel, so when he came and said leukaemia it was just unexpected.\n\n\u2018When you\u2019re poorly you have all these possibilities going through your head but you never think it\u2019s going to be that.\n\n\u2018I had a really good chat with Matt\u2019s consultant where I questioned whether I should have done more, if I had spotted things sooner, whether if I had been more pushy in getting him to hospital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But the symptoms are vague and it can come on within days. It doesn\u2019t have to be something that has been happening for weeks or months.\u2019\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia is an aggressive and quickly progressing type of cancer affecting white blood cells. Around 790 adults in the UK are diagnosed with it in the UK each year.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
