It will have a crew of 11.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Cup teams take extraordinary steps to protect their technology from the prying eyes of opponents, in this case the four teams which will challenge for the Cup from March 2021.\n\nBut Team New Zealand seemed unusually relaxed in displaying the new-generation Cup defender to rivals ahead of its launching ceremony Friday.\n\n\u201cThe spies are about to become very busy,\u201d the team said on its Facebook page.\n\nAs defender, Team New Zealand was allowed to choose the type of sailboat in which it would defend the title it won from Team USA in foiling multi-hulls in 2017. It chose to move to an unprecedented class of mono-hulls, stretching the limits of sailing technology.\n\nItalian challenger Prada is due to unveil its first sailboat early next week.\n\n____\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "America's Cup defending champions Team New Zealand has revealed its revolutionary foiling mono-hull, showing off the sleek sailboat a day ahead of its official launch.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/new_zealand_americas_cup_80253_c0-73-5000-2988_s1770x1032.jpg?77245091c4205e8b5f2818fa79ea1afd9935ea4a", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
