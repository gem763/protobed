A big part of those new features is making it easier for developers to build apps that integrate with the service.\n\nBear Douglas, Slack\u2019s director of developer relations, told Business Insider that many of the new features came about after seeing how developers were creatively getting the Slack platform to provide the level of flexibility they needed.\n\n\u201cHow are [developers] bending your platform to suit their needs, and how can you meet that need,\u201d Douglas said of the reasoning.\n\nThese new features make it easier for users to connect to outside applications they may be using along with Slack \u2013 for example, Google Calendar. This push for integration with outside apps like Google\u2019s, is fueled by Slack\u2019s continued rivalry with Microsoft\u2019s Teams app, which is bundled and integrated with the Microsoft Office 365 suite of business software.\n\ncaption A new landing page for the Google Calendar app in Slack. source Slack\n\nDouglas said part of Slack\u2019s appeal is that it is an open platform that can be custom-tailored to meet any need, no matter how obscure. She also highlighted how Slack\u2019s app directory \u2013 essentially its app store \u2013 is stocked full of many of the most common integrations and tools that a user might need. That includes some Microsoft software, sure, she said, but also from other vendors large and small.\n\n\u201cSome of the software might already have some integration in the app directory, and if it doesn\u2019t you have the ability to write it. That makes all the difference,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cOur customers should be able to choose the best software that they want to use, and we should make it possible for them to have that experience\u2026and if that includes things like [Microsoft] Onedrive and Outlook Calendar, absolutely, that works for some of our customers.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Teams is a workplace communication hub that integrates Office 365. This makes it an appealing option for companies who rely on Office 365 applications like Outlook and Word. In July, Microsoft said its Teams app had 13 million daily active users, which it said put them ahead of Slack.\n\nEarlier in October, Slack announced new daily active user numbers, saying it has 12 million daily active users, a 37 percent increase from a year prior. That\u2019s still less than Microsoft Teams, but Slack highlighted its user engagement figures, which it said showed much people like using the app.\n\nBuilding a community\n\nSlack is answering this rivalry in part by doubling down on the people who build the tools that integrate with Slack. It\u2019s been building out a community made up of outside developers building new software and apps for public consumption, and developers within the companies that use Slack.\n\n\u201cOver the last nine months to a year, we\u2019ve been working on building out our own Slack platform community,\u201d Douglas said. She added that Slack is also releasing a certification program for developers who want to develop Slack apps, aimed at growing the community even more.\n\nSlack says it has over 1,800 apps in its app directory, and over 500,000 custom apps were actively on a weekly basis. It also says that it now has almost 600,000 daily active registered developers designing apps for Slack.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft has a well established developer community, with several major business applications beyond its own offering Teams integrations.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown on the specifics of the new features Slack announced today:\n\nA landing page where users can see all of their available Slack apps, and a new home page within those apps to view and interact with the program directly through Slack.\n\nNew windows to help launch and interact with apps directly (like sending a survey or launching an online class directly in Slack).\n\nA new \u201cactions\u201d button that is accessible anywhere in the app (including in search), to access app integrations anywhere while using Slack (for tasks like submitting expenses and scheduling a meeting). It is currently available as a closed beta that will be made publicly available in the coming months.", "description": "Business Insider - Slack announced new features to help users integrate and collaborate with outside apps within Slack, and is building out its developer community..
