Well, more specifically, you can buy Impossible Burger 2.0 at Gelson\u2019s Market in Southern California, but the company plans an America-wide rollout soon. We got our hands on a couple of bricks of the stuff and cooked up some burgers and tacos. They tasted good! The feeling of raw Impossible chuck between my fingers, however, is something I will not soon forget.\n\nOne adjective stands out: slimy. Impossible not-meat is essentially based on soy and potato protein, and the formula also includes sunflower and coconut oil to simulate the presence of animal fat and also help it sizzle on the grill. The magic ingredient, the company says, is something called heme, a molecule that exists in actual blood that gives the Impossible burger a meat-like taste. There\u2019s also a binding agent, methylcellulose, which is also used to make ice cream and jams and stuff. I\u2019m not sure exactly what gives raw Impossible its slimy consistency, but beware that it feels a little unsettling.\n\nThings get more unsettling when you get the raw Impossible in the pan. This is how we cooked our taco meat, and we were immediately impressed to see how the Impossible Food browns up just like beef. We were less thrilled by the smell that somewhere between buttered popcorn and crushed up peanuts, with just a hint of ammonia. The odour probably won\u2019t bother you if you\u2019re cooking on a big stove with a powerful hood. In our tiny Brooklyn kitchen, it was overpowering. Once we got outside for the burger portion of the test, however, we didn\u2019t catch any of that buttery, nutty scent.\n\nThe extent to which there\u2019s not much more to say about the difference between cooking Impossible fake meat and actual ground beef is a testament to the company\u2019s technology. The finished Impossible taco meat looked identical to our finished ground beef. The finished Impossible burgers were a little bit crumbly but biting into them reveal a surprisingly beef-like texture. The Impossible burgers did lack the greasy bite you get out of a proper hamburger, but with the right amount of toppings, you might not be able to tell the difference. Ditto for the tacos.\n\nSo go forth vegetarians and pretend to eat meat. Understand that the Impossible food doesn\u2019t taste like very fine meat, like the ribeye you might get at a fancy burger restaurant. It tastes a little bit like fast food meat. But if your alternative is the Beyond Burger \u2014 which we also tested and could not eat because it was so awful \u2014 Impossible is a pretty incredible option!\n\nEditor's Note: Australians may have to settle for another fake meat alternative if Impossible doesn't make it to our shores. Until then, we hope you enjoyed Adam's meaty review!", "description": "Impossible Foods has started selling its new fake ground beef in American grocery stores.
