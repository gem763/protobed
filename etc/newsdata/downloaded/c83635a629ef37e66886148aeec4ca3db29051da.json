Then tragedy struck.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nIn this July 9, 1960 photo, the USS Thresher is launched bow-first at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine.\n\nTom Wiley was sitting in his dorm room at Purdue University listening to his transistor radio when he heard about the missing submarine.\n\nThe radio hadn\u2019t been working lately, but his roommate got it on just as word came about the USS Thresher. Wiley\u2019s big brother, John Joseph, \u201cJJ,\u201d was a 23-year-old officer on the submarine. A Naval Academy graduate who had been handed his degree by President John F. Kennedy, JJ \u2014 one of the six children of a locomotive engineer from Altoona, Pa. \u2014 was among the Navy\u2019s best. He was Tom\u2019s hero.\n\nJJ was aboard a nuclear sub that was one of the Navy\u2019s latest, with 128 other elite sailors, officers and shipyard personnel. The Thresher was the first of its class of nuclear-powered attack submarines. It was undergoing deep-diving trials on April 10, 1963, when the boat went silent in 8,500 feet of water off the coast of New England. The last thing an escort ship had heard was an ominous rumble from far below.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, in Arlington National Cemetery, Thomas J. Wiley, now 75, a retired Secret Service special agent in charge, is scheduled to speak at the dedication of a granite memorial to the crew of the Thresher, the sinking of which is said to be the deadliest submarine loss in maritime history.\n\nCrew families, as well as friends, legislators, and current and former Navy officials are gathering to honor the men who perished when the boat burst a leak and imploded under the pressure of the ocean as it drifted out of control past its \u201ccrush\u201d depth.\n\nHistorians think the implosion happened in milliseconds around 1,500 feet, and that scattered pieces of the boat then drifted to the bottom more than a mile below.\n\nNo bodies were ever recovered, and their loss was front-page news across the country. The wreckage was found a few months later.\n\n(In the 1980s, the Navy and oceanographer Robert Ballard secretly teamed up to dive on the Thresher\u2019s sunken nuclear reactor, which in 1985 was found to be intact, according to the National Geographic Society, where Ballard is an explorer in residence. After the Navy mission, Ballard had 12 days left over. He used it to find the Titanic.)\n\n\u201cThe guys on the Thresher were the cream,\u201d said Kevin M. Galeaz, a submarine veteran and president of the project and foundation that got the monument built. \u201cYou took the best, you took latest and greatest ship, gone, and it just stunned everybody.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy, left, presents Lt. j.g. John Joseph Wiley with his diploma at his Naval Academy graduation in 1961. He reported to his first submarine, USS Thresher, in December 1962. He and the rest of the crew died in the boat's sinking in April 1963.\n\nTwo members of the crew were brothers \u2014 Master Chief Electrician\u2019s Mate Benjamin N. Shafer, 36, and Senior Chief Electrician\u2019s Mate John D. Shafer, 33.\n\nThe boat\u2019s skipper, Lt. Cmdr. John Wesley \u201cWes\u201d Harvey, 36, had served on the USS Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine, and had taken command of the Thresher four months earlier. But he had never before been to sea in the boat, according to John Bently, author of the book, \u201cThe Thresher Disaster.\u201d\n\nNeither, apparently, had Wiley.\n\nOne sailor, Alan D. Sinnett, 29, had been on the Thresher for only six days.\n\nFifty-five-year-old Henry Charles Moreau, a World War II veteran and longtime employee of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where the Thresher was built, was onboard as an air conditioning expert.\n\nThresher officer Raymond A. McCoole was ordered off the boat hours before its fatal trip. His wife had suffered an accidental eye injury, the boat was crowded with 21 observers and the captain needed an extra bunk.\n\nAfterward, to McCoole\u2019s dismay, he was hailed as the luckiest man alive.\n\nThen there was Machinist\u2019s Mate 2nd Class George John Keisecker, 48, a World War II veteran who had been on a submarine that entered Tokyo Bay when the war ended. He was terrified of the Thresher, telling his wife the boat was troubled, not ready for sea, and was a \u201ccoffin.\u201d\n\nThe Thresher had been in commission only 20 months and was beset with problems. It had spent the previous nine months in port for repairs. And Keisecker said the fixes had been rushed.\n\n\u201cHoney, I have a feeling this will be our last trip,\u201d he reportedly told his wife, Lily, just before the boat sailed. \u201cYou will be a wealthy widow before the week is over.\u201d\n\nThe Thresher left the Naval shipyard at Kittery, Maine, at 8:05 a.m. on April 9, after a tedious nine-month overhaul, and headed for the open ocean to conduct test dives.\n\nThe boat\u2019s capability was such that its deepest diving test had to be conducted beyond the shallow water of the continental shelf, where the water is less than 600 feet deep. And after some initial tests in the shallow water, the Thresher headed out to where the ocean was 1,400 fathoms, or a mile and half, deep.\n\nThe sub was escorted by a rescue vessel, the 17-year-old USS Skylark. The Skylark carried special equipment and a submarine rescue chamber. But the chamber could only go down to a depth of 850 feet. It could work well in the waters of the shelf but would be almost useless where the Thresher was headed.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how far down the doomed sub intended to go on its main test dive, nor at what depth the boat would be destroyed by the enormous water pressure.\n\nNaval historian Norman Polmar, in his book, \u201cDeath of the USS Thresher,\u201d estimated that boat\u2019s test depth was 800 to 1,000 feet, and that its \u201ccollapse depth\u201d was about 1,200 to 1,500 feet.\n\n\n\nA fragment of the anchor from the USS Thresher located near the wreckage. (U.S. Navy)\n\nCollapse occurs in a split second, said Galeaz, of the monument project.\n\n\u201cIn one-twentieth of a second, literally, it implodes,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cPoof, like that. It is so fast [that] one of the small blessings of this is that even though the guys knew they were going down \u2026 [the end] happened instantaneously.\u201d\n\nOn the morning of April 10, the ocean was calm, with a slight swell, a Navy inquiry found later. Visibility was 10 miles. An eight-mile-an-hour breeze was blowing from the north. No other ships were known to be around.\n\nThe Thresher was so crowded, with 12 officers, 96 enlisted men, and 21 observers, that 30 temporary bunks had been set up in the empty torpedo room, according to Bently.\n\nAt 7:47 a.m., the submerged submarine told the Skylark via an underwater acoustic \u201ctelephone\u201d that it was starting its deep dive.\n\nThe escort ship was about two miles away. The Skylark\u2019s captain, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley W. Hecker, later said he knew little about the Thresher. \u201cI had no information as to \u2026 her depth, speed and range,\u201d according to Polmar.\n\nAs the dive proceeded, the submarine reported its depth to Skylark.\n\nAt 7:52 it reached 400 feet, and paused to check for leaks.\n\nAt 8:09 it was halfway to its test depth. All seemed well.\n\nLt. j.g. James D. Watson, the Skylark\u2019s navigator, was on the \u201cphone\u201d with the submarine.\n\nAt 8:27 the Thresher started toward its test depth.\n\nThe sub checked in at 9:02 and 9:12.\n\nThen, about 9:13, the Thresher reported: \u201cExperiencing minor difficulties. Have positive up angle. Am attempting to blow. Will keep you informed.\u201d\n\nIn hindsight, this was alarming, Galeaz said. It suggested something was wrong and the sub was blowing air into its ballast tanks to head toward the surface.\n\nTwo impulses were detected, from 9:09 to 9:11 and from 9:13 to 9:14, which might have been made by the sub blowing its ballast tanks.\n\nAt 9:14 Skylark lost contact with the Thresher.\n\nHecker, the Skylark\u2019s skipper, called the submarine and three times asked, \u201cAre you in control?\u201d\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nFour minutes later, a \u201chigh energy, low frequency noise disturbance,\u201d was heard from far below, the Navy inquiry said.\n\nIt was the sound of the Thresher being crushed.\n\nBack at Purdue, Tom Wiley hurried from his dorm room to find a TV. After seeing the television reports, he returned to his room. The radio was now off, he recalled. His roommate said it had cut out just as Tom had left the room.\n\n\u201cThe radio never worked again,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called his mother, who confirmed the bad news, and caught a train for Altoona the next day.\n\nIt was a 12-hour trip: \u201cEvery train stop, I got off the train hoping to hear the good news that the submarine had been found and they were all safe.\"\n\n\u201cIt never came out,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe remarkable story of four stranded nuns, a remote island and a heroic submarine rescue\n\nThe German sub sank over 70 years ago.
