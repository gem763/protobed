Magazine: \u2018The baby was conceived not long after we got engaged in March.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s definitely the most wonderful engagement present we could ever wish for.\u2019\n\nThe 27-year-old might be postponing their wedding until the arrival of their baby as they \u2018want to get it right\u2019.\n\n\u2018Our wedding is about telling our friends and family that we want to be together forever and what counts is that our little baby will be with us,\u2019 she said. \u2018That\u2019s really special.\u2019\n\nAmy is already five months pregnant and kept the news of her pregnancy a secret as she wanted to check that her baby was healthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe underwent an amniocentesis, which checks the full spectrum of any chromosomal and genetic conditions.\n\nAmy waited several months to share the news (Picture: Hello!

(Picture: Hello! magazine/PA)\n\n\u2018I was all set to do some extreme skiing,\u2019 Amy told Hello! at the time. \u2018Then I spied a breakfast picnic set up with candles, a firepit, a bottle of our favourite champagne and red roses everywhere.\n\n\u2018Then he dropped to both knees and pulled out a box from his pocket containing the most beautiful ring. It felt like a dream.\n\n\u2018And the second time around I made him do it on one knee because I didn\u2019t know if proposing on both knees counted.\u2019\n\nDaniel, of course, proposed a second time properly.\n\nHe said: \u2018I couldn\u2019t have asked for it to go better. She\u2019s like Sherlock Holmes \u2013 you can\u2019t get anything by her.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Now it does feel like the next chapter,\u2019 Amy continued.\n\nThe full interview is available in Hello magazine, out now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
