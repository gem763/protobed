The report predicts that the most impressive returns will come from investments that strengthen early warning systems for disasters like storms and floods.\n\n\u201cIf we delay adaptation, we will pay such a high price that we would never be able to look at ourselves in the mirror,\u201d Christiana Figueres, who previously headed the United Nations\u2019 Framework Convention on Climate Change during the adoption of the Paris climate agreement, said in a press call ahead of the report launch. \u201cEither we delay and pay, or we plan and prosper.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither we delay and pay, or we plan and prosper.\u201d\n\nThe research was released by the Global Commission on Adaptation, an organization jointly headed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, and World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva. According to the report, \u201cfailing to seize the economic benefits of climate adaptation with high-return investments would undermine trillions of dollars in potential growth and prosperity.\u201d\n\nTo see those $7 trillion in benefits, the report says, governments and companies will need to funnel money into five areas. The first is to improve early warning systems for disastrous events. Second, it calls for making infrastructure more climate-resilient. It also carves out spending for getting more out of crops while using less water and preserving mangroves that protect coastal communities from storm surge. Lastly, it highlights better management of the world\u2019s water resources. The benefits of spending in all of these areas outweigh the costs by four to one.\n\nThe predicted $7 trillion in returns won\u2019t go directly back to stakeholders in the form of cold hard cash. Instead, that number includes all of the damage avoided by better preparing for climate catastrophes (such as storms or heatwaves), and economic, and social and environmental benefits of the projects. \u201cBy investing in certain areas, one can reduce risk, one can improve productivity, one can stimulate innovation in ways that could generate other benefits,\u201d Manish Bapna, a lead author and executive vice president and managing director of the World Resources Institute, told The Verge.\n\nThe advantages are biggest when it comes to tackling the ways we warn and prepare people for disasters. \u201cEarly warning systems save lives and assets worth at least ten times their cost,\u201d the report says. Giving a warning 24 hours ahead of a storm or heatwave can minimize damage by 30 percent by giving people a chance to prepare for the extreme weather. And the authors say that spending $800 million on these systems in developing countries could prevent up to $16 billion in losses each year.\n\n\u201cNobody needs to die in a heatwave.\u201d\n\nRecent events, including Hurricane Dorian\u2019s deadly toll in the Bahamas and this summer's sweltering heat in France highlight why severe extreme weather events are at the forefront of people\u2019s minds. \u201cThere is a sense of inevitability and helplessness in the face of such events, that nothing can be done or that anything that is being done will not be sufficient to stop the devastating consequences of a warming climate,\u201d Ban said on the press call. \u201cI\u2019m here today to tell you that it\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\n\nBapna pointed to how warning systems can be improved ahead of disaster, thanks to data science and the rapid spread of information and communications technologies. \u201cThe ability to process big data more effectively is enabling us to provide more granular weather forecasts,\u201d Bapna says.\n\nJohn Harding, climate risk and early warning systems secretariat at the World Meteorological Organization, says those advances have prevented storms like Hurricane Dorian from being even more catastrophic. \u201cIt is now possible thanks to higher modeling capacity to show the path of the hurricane up to 5 days in advance with pretty high accuracy - thus allowing life saving measures to be put in place,\u201d Harding told The Verge in an email. \u201cThis is a key factor behind the relatively low loss of life compared to the scale of physical damage.\u201d\n\nBetter forecasts can also be used to pinpoint which groups will be most vulnerable and figure out how to reach them in a more targeted way. \u201cNobody needs to die in a heatwave,\u201d Kristie Ebi, a professor at the University of Washington\u2019s Center for Health and the Global Environment, tells The Verge. Understanding those vulnerabilities will be increasingly important as climate change throws more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030 within developing countries alone, according to the report. Its authors call for prioritizing improvements in early warning systems in the least developed countries and small island developing states.\n\nEbi adds that figuring out what message to send and how to make people listen can be equally as important as knowing when to send it. \u201cThere\u2019s much more investment into setting thresholds for when to declare a warning than there is, in fact, in how do we increase effective response?\u201d she says. \u201cWhen hurricanes start approaching, there\u2019s always a fair number of people who say, \u2018I\u2019ve seen a storm before, I\u2019m going to stay in place.\u201d\n\nBapna proposed finding ways to finance preparedness and recovery based on forecasts before the disaster even strikes. Traditionally he says, \u201cgovernment or insurance agents go out, they survey the damage, they quantify what the damage has been, shortly thereafter, you get the money.\u201d Instead, he proposes, \u201cIf we\u2019re able to actually allocate that money before the disaster strikes, as imprecise as that may be, you can oftentimes use much less money much more effectively.\u201d\n\nBoth Bapna and Ban pointed to Bangladesh for a case study on successfully reducing the toll a major storm takes. The death toll of cyclones in the country dropped from 138,000 in the 1991 cyclone that struck the region of Chittagong to 3,363 deaths during Cyclone Sidr in 2007. Cyclone Fani in 2019 killed five people. The report attributes the sharp fall to the country putting in place stronger early warning systems and scaling up its disaster response.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about this in terms of dollars, but there is much more of a human story or dimension to this,\u201d Bapna says. \u201cThese are modest investments that can be made that can reduce death and human misery significantly.\u201d", "description": "Spending $1.8 trillion on climate adaptation projects  between 2020 to 2030 would result in $7.1 trillion in total net benefits over time, the authors of a new global report say.
