Photo: Amazon, Getty Images\n\nGun to my head, if I had to sum up what a \u201cVSCO girl\u201d is in one word, it would be \u201cbasic.\u201d But gun to my head, I would probably use my last breath to say that I am 24 years old and I should not feel this ancient because of an internet trend.\n\nIn recent months, the VSCO girl has become inescapable in certain corners of the internet \u2014 mainly those that teens flock to, like YouTube and TikTok \u2014 and made its way into established outlets like the New York Times and BuzzFeed News. I\u2019d sum it up as \u201cmanic pixie ecowarrior,\u201d though a teen I know described the archetype more bluntly \u2014 as \u201cannoying, white hopeless romantics.\u201d\n\nThe VSCO girl is both a person and a meme, blandly aspirational to many, but also the subject of pointed parody. It has a hyperspecific set of associations and aesthetics. The name comes from VSCO, a popular photo-editing app, known for its dreamy \u201cis that a film camera?\u201d filters. And the VSCO girl has a set uniform as well: Brandy Melville crop tops and oversize tees that eclipse one\u2019s jean shorts, scrunchies, a perpetually dewy face courtesy of Mario Badescu facial sprays, Pura Vida puka-shell bracelets, a Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven backpack, and a sticker-covered Hydro Flask water bottle. They love taking photos in nature and engage with sustainability in ways that match their aesthetic \u2014 they use reusable metal straws, but also disposable cameras (the OG VSCO filter).\n\nThere\u2019s also a signature VSCO-girl vernacular. As parodied in a TikTok that recently went viral, a stereotypical VSCO girl can\u2019t go more than five breaths without saying \u201cand I oop\u201d \u2014 a reference to a video of the drag queen Jasmine Masters, used to express surprise \u2014 or \u201csksksksksk,\u201d which is meant to represent excitement, sort of like \u201cOMG,\u201d and pronounced, well, phonetically: like \u201cski\u201d without the \u201ci.\u201d\n\nBecause VSCO allows users to upload to a social media feed without likes or comments, it functions as a more low-pressure Instagram, essentially, where many VSCO girls will post things that may not get good engagement on their Instagram grid: inspirational quotes, GIFs of themselves dancing while driving in a convertible, and carefully filtered photos of their Hydro Flasks. (On Instagram, they\u2019ll post bikini pics and selfies.)\n\nBut the concept of a VSCO girl extends far beyond its eponymous app; it\u2019s so popular on TikTok that the app has a dedicated VSCO-girl filter, which includes a water bottle decorated with stickers and a side ponytail tied with several scrunchies. This was added on August 30, three days after #sksksk first started trending (it\u2019s still trending). On YouTube, thousands of videos are dedicated to \u201cVSCO-girl transformation,\u201d wherein a teen girl gives herself a VSCO makeover, donning Crocs or Birkenstocks and wrist scrunchies. These aren\u2019t portrayed as parodies or a time of self-reflection. They\u2019re consistently framed as this is something I am not. But as I was watching them, I was thinking, Wait, aren\u2019t these chicks VSCO girls?\n\nSydney Serena, a teen vlogger with over a million subscribers on YouTube and 515,000 on Instagram, uses and promotes her VSCO, and fits the VSCO aesthetic to a T. However, she also posted two videos about undergoing a VSCO-girl transformation. They were both situated as \u201cI am going to do VSCO stuff for this video, which is not what I usually do.\u201d So \u2026 is she a VSCO girl or not?\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t take the term \u2018VSCO girl\u2019 too seriously, and I don\u2019t like to put labels on myself,\u201d she told me over email. \u201cI just like being creative and taking fun photos.\u201d However, she does \u201clove VSCO girl\u2013themed things.\u201d\n\nMarla Fay is another vlogger with over 64,400 Instagram followers whose aesthetic is similar to Sydney Serena\u2019s and the VSCO archetype. She uses the app in addition to YouTube and Instagram, but likes that it doesn\u2019t track engagement like Instagram. \u201c[People] turn to VSCO because it\u2019s a safe place to be creative and expressive,\u201d she said.\n\nSo is Fay as VSCO girl? Yes and no, according to her. \u201cDo I like scrunchies, big sweatshirts, Pura Vida bracelets, reusable straws, and Hydro Flasks like most girls in this generation? Yeah. If that is what they say about VSCO girls, what it actually means is that these girls are looking for comfort and companies that give back to the environment and that is a great thing.\u201d But like Serena, she would rather not limit herself to one definition.\n\nIf anything, the VSCO aesthetic feels more like a relic, a callback to when everyone was carefully choosing whether to use Kelvin or Hudson on their Instagram photos and taking photos of latte art, when all that was expected was a cute, filtered photo, as opposed to the trying-not-to-seem-like-I\u2019m-trying aesthetic that dominates Instagram today. It\u2019s such a random grouping of products and interests that vaguely links back to being free-spirited and ecofriendly that if you looked deep inside yourself, you\u2019d probably find a VSCO quality. You\u2019d probably find a basic one too.", "description": "Diving into the internet trend of \u201cVSCO girls.\u201d Who are they?
