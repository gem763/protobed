After 86 years, Washington baseball fans get a World Series to call their own when the Nationals take on the Houston Astros in a best-of-seven starting Tuesday in Texas.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 bid for a title comes as the city is rapidly dispensing with the idea of a Washington sports curse: The Capitals kicked open the door last year with a Stanley Cup, the Mystics won the WNBA title earlier this month, and now the Nationals, full of swagger and loaded with talent, will take their turn at the plate.\n\nIf this Nationals team feels different, that\u2019s because it is. This is a squad, after all, that climbed out of a 19-31 hole to eventually sweep the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such a ball down the hill experience that\u2019s been rolling into something that we can\u2019t quite stop,\u201d Nationals outfielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cJust gotta continue to roll with it.\n\n\u201cI feel like if you stop and you take a breath, and you think we\u2019ve made it, you\u2019re going to lose the next round or you\u2019re going to lose the next game.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals, who arrived in the District in 2005, haven\u2019t traveled through the baseball desert like some of their fans who grew up rooting for the long-departed Senators.\n\nBut there have been trying times and bitter disappointments on the journey to the Fall Classic.\n\nThere were the 100-plus loss-seasons late last decade. There were playoff meltdowns and narrow defeats. Between 2014 and 2017, eight of the Nationals\u2019 nine playoff losses were by a single run. They were World Series favorites in recent years, only to come up short.\n\nOn this iteration of the Nationals, only seven players \u2014 Matt Adams, Brian Dozier, Max Scherzer, Anibal Sanchez, Fernando Rodney, Yan Gomes and Hunter Strickland \u2014 have previously played in a World Series. Only one, Strickland, has ever won it all.\n\nThe Nationals are the oldest team in the league \u2014 by a considerable margin. According to ESPN, the Nationals\u2019 average age is 31.1, topping the Atlanta Braves\u2019 29.7.\n\nGeneral manager Mike Rizzo values experience. He says he wants players who have lived through both success and failures.\n\nWith the veterans comes a sense of urgency. Team meetings are rare for Washington \u2014 manager Dave Martinez prefers to meet individually with a player if he\u2019s struggling. But the veterans delivered a message in an early spring training team gathering.\n\nScherzer, Sanchez and catcher Kurt Suzuki emphasized the importance of the year ahead.\n\n\u201cAll those guys basically said, \u2018I\u2019m getting old. We\u2019re getting old. And we want to win and we have the guys in this room to win,\u2019\u201d Eaton said.\n\nThe Nationals believe the veteran presence helped overcome the season\u2019s poor start.\n\nEaton said his teammates are \u201cpretty level-headed,\u201d which helps the team\u2019s chemistry over the course of a long year. No player, he said, is off limits when it comes to the team\u2019s propensity for poking fun at one another.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t happen everywhere,\u201d Eaton said.\n\nThe fun-loving Nationals enter the World Series having won 16 of their last 18. Even in intense moments \u2014 rallying in both the wild card game and Game 5 of the NLDS \u2014 the team kept its composure.\n\nIn many ways, these Nationals look like another team in town that conquered its demons to win its first title: the Washington Capitals.\n\nWhen Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby watches the Nationals, he sees similarities to his team\u2019s Stanley Cup run in 2018.\n\nNeither team played with any pressure, he said.\n\n\u201cThey just started to learn how to play as a group and have fun with it,\u201d Holtby said. \u201cYou could tell. The playoffs this year was a lot like us. They weren\u2019t tense. They weren\u2019t the favorites where they had to win. They were playing because they wanted to keep playing together. \u2026 That was exactly like us.\u201d\n\nBefore the Capitals won their first title, years of playoff exits took a toll.\n\nWith memories of the Washington Redskins\u2019 Super Bowl wins fading, new generations of District sports fans increasingly knew nothing but regular season misery or early playoff exits.\n\nUntil the Capitals beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2018, there were 71 consecutive seasons in Washington in which a major pro sports team failed to reach a conference final.\n\nThe 20-year streak was the longest in sports with cities with at least one NHL, NBA, MLB or NFL team.\n\nEven Nationals reliever Sean Doolittle picked up on the city\u2019s history when he first arrived in the District during the 2017 trade deadline. That year, Doolittle, Ryan Madson and Brandon Kintzler were acquired in attempt to shore up the bullpen.\n\nDoolittle recalled the reaction from fans: \u201c\u2018This is the year that we\u2019re going to do it. We\u2019re going to get past the first round of the playoffs.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said he couldn\u2019t believe how little confidence District fans had.\n\n\u201cWe have a team that can win the World Series,\u201d Doolittle said, recalling the moment. \u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s changed now.\n\nFans have shown they can get behind Washington teams. Capitals center Lars Eller glowingly remembered how fans packed the team\u2019s practice rink before they traveled to Las Vegas for the Cup final. The Washington Mystics had a full stadium when they beat the Connecticut Sun earlier this month.\n\nTo add the Nationals to that honor roll, the Nationals will have to beat one of the best teams in baseball.\n\nHouston, which won it all in 2017, features a star-studded rotation led by Justin Verlander, Gerrit Cole and Zack Greinke. They have homegrown talent in Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and Alex Bregman.\n\nWashington, though, doesn\u2019t want its run to end.\n\n\u201cFor us, we didn\u2019t come this far just to get here,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cIt feels cool being a part of a team that won the first playoff series in Nats history and played in the first championship series ever at Nats Park. That stuff\u2019s really, really cool but there will be time to look back and appreciate those kinds of things later.\n\n\u201cBut for now, we just really want that championship.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
