He began terrorising her in the fallout, while claiming she made up the attack.\n\nRobert has been wanting revenge, and last month he ended up hospitalising Lee after a fight - with Robert now facing prison charges.\n\nBut things escalate next week when Lee dies, with Robert and husband Aaron Dingle soon realising the trouble he will now be in.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWith the duo deciding to leave the village for good, actor Ryan has now revealed all on his \"emotional goodbye\" from the soap.\n\nHe said of the death twist: \"The news has just been broken to them so they haven\u2019t really got a plan, they are going to have to take it as it comes.\n\n\"It means some very emotional goodbyes to some people in the village, but they have to be quick and there are some people they don\u2019t even get the chance to because there just isn\u2019t time.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"The police are literally on their way so they have to be fast and quickly make it out of the village. They really believe they are going to stay on the run and make it work. There were very emotional goodbyes with a real sense of urgency.\"\n\nOn bowing out of the soap and bringing an end to Robron, the star shared his sadness about departing the role he has played since 2014.\n\nHe said: \"I will miss the show massively, it has been a huge part of my life for the last few years.\n\n\"I love working here, I love the people that I work with and it\u2019s going to be very emotional leaving.\"\n\nThe pair will flee the village in scenes to air next week, while Ryan has also explained Aaron's decision to go with Robert.\n\nHe said: \"Robert is initially reluctant for Aaron to join him, but Aaron says there is no way you are leaving without me so he reluctantly accepts that.\n\n\"He knows he has to go and it has to be quick.\"\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode at 8pm on Thursdays.", "description": "Robert Sugden actor Ryan Hawley has confirmed new details about his exit from Emmerdale, after the death of a character", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18956325.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/34_07_EMM_RYAN_AARON_01JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
