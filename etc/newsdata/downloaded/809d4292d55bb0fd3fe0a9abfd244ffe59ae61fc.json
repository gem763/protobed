It\u2019s just a story that is unbelievable.\u2019\n\nAs she gears up to join Shirley Ballas, Craig Revel Horwood and Bruno Tonioli on the Strictly judging panel tonight, Motsi said she was excited but also feels a \u2018lot of responsibility\u2019 as it\u2019s such a \u2018big role.\u2019\n\nShe said her differences to much-loved Darcey Bussell will set her apart and give her \u2018space to develop and do what I want.\u2019\n\nShe moved to Germany at 18, where she became a professional dancer and judge on the German version of Strictly, Let\u2019s Dance.\n\nShe married dance partner Timo Kulczak in 2003 but they split in 2014.
