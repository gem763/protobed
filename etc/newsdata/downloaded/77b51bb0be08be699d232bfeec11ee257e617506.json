This was in stark contrast to the detail with which they addressed health care, education, gun control and the war in Afghanistan. Their silence, half-truths or platitudes on these issues was surprising.\n\nHowever, the fact that none of the participants repeated the commitment to decriminalize unauthorized entry into the United States is worthy of praise. Unauthorized entry should indeed be decriminalized, but saying so during a campaign against President Trump is akin to political suicide. But none of the candidates touched on any of these other pressing issues in their opening or closing remarks. And it was only in response to the Univision anchor Jorge Ramos\u2019s queries about immigration, asylum and Venezuela that they tepidly clarified their stances.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro said of the shootings in El Paso: \u201cSomeone drove 10 hours to kill people who look like me and my family.\u201d And yet he was much more cautious about his immigration plan, preferring to center his statements on Dreamers, or DACA, an important but \u201csafe\u201d issue that even President Trump can agree to. His silence on decriminalization was all the more conspicuous, considering he brought up the issue in a debate in June.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke touched upon, but without detail \u2014 and partly in Spanish \u2014 one of the more complicated aspects of immigration: what should be done about people who overstay their visas. Elizabeth Warren supported creating a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented foreigners in the United States today, but again, without specifics. And former Vice President Biden wavered when asked whether he thought President Barack Obama\u2019s mass deportations had been a mistake or not \u2014 granted, a tough question that perhaps he was wise to avoid answering.", "description": "A serious discussion of Hispanic and Latin American issues was absent from the debate.", "authors": ["Jorge G.
