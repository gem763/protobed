Europeans start voting on Thursday in four days of elections to the EU parliament that will influence not just Brussels policy for the next five years but, to some extent, the very future of the Union project itself.\n\nUK spending on security for MPs topped at least \u00a34.2 million ($5.2 million) in the latest data available, continuing its climb since Labour MP and Remain campaigner Jo Cox was killed by a far-right extremist days before the June 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nYesterday, Labour MPs invoked Cox\u2019s memory, with Paula Sheriff calling on prime minister Boris Johnson to stop using words like \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d when discussing Brexit. She said that language was being echoed in the harassment and death threats lawmakers face.\n\nJohnson retorted that he\u2019d \u201cnever heard such humbug in all my life,\u201d which sparked a furious reaction among the opposition.\n\nHe then responded to Labour MP Tracy Brabin\u2019s invocation of Cox. \u201cThe best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done,\u201d he said.\n\nBrendan Cox, the husband of the late politician, said he felt \u201ca bit sick at Jo\u2019s name being used in this way.\u201d\n\nFeel a bit sick at Jo\u2019s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common. \u2014 Brendan Cox (@MrBrendanCox) September 25, 2019\n\nThreats against MPs have reportedly surged since the Brexit vote. In addition to the 2016 to 2017 period, spending also grew from 2017 to 2018, after a March 2017 terror attack outside parliament left six people dead.\n\nThe head of the UK\u2019s Metropolitan police said earlier this year that the number of threats and harassment directed at MPs is now \u201cunprecedented.\u201d The police chief cited a polarized political climate as a driving force behind the uptick, and said women and non-white MPs were at particular risk.\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s comments yesterday, leader of the pro-Remain Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson told the House that she had reported a death threat against one of her children to police.\n\n\u201cI cannot overstate the frequency by which I have been informed over the last year or so by members on both sides of the House and on both sides of the Brexit argument of the fact and persistence of threats they have received,\u201d said John Bercow, speaker of the House.\n\nBercow today said that the tone of dialogue in parliament yesterday was worse than any in his 22-year parliamentary career. He called on MPs to \u201clower the decibel level\u201d and to not behave as enemies.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "MP Jo Cox was killed by a man with far-right views days ahead of the 2016 referendum.", "authors": ["Adam Rasmi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_LlmchD9dIoTimEekojZlg--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/13109522a8bac494d6413fd8eef408f0", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
