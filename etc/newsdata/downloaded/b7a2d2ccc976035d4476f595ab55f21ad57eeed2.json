On Friday afternoon, a group of hackers known as the \"Chuckling Hella\" gang seemingly was able to post a litany of vulgar, anti-Semitic, and racist language on Jack Dorsey's official account.\n\nAt 3:44 pm ET, Jack's account, with handle @jack, tweeted, \" Shoutout Debug, Corey, NuBLoM, Joe, Owen, & Aqua #ChucklingHella.\"\n\nIn a series of twenty or so tweets, the hackers then posted the N-word, comments about Hitler and Nazi Germany, and other odd messages. They even threatened to blow up Twitter HQ, though it is unclear how serious this threat was.\n\nTwitter users, of course, responded as they typically do -- a mix of sarcasm and jokes while being questionably concerned.\n\nThis is what you call a hi-jack-ing ??? https://t.co/dOCx7YvmRY \u2014 Jeff Cimmino (@jeffcimmino) August 30, 2019\n\nTweeting a bomb threat from the hacked account of the CEO of Twitter is like an express lane to prison. \u2014 Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) August 30, 2019\n\nJust imagine the head of Twitter's security team right now, on seven different kinds of mushrooms, nude, in a giant bamboo steampunk rocketship called the Love Temple, ignoring his push notifications \u2014 Tom Gara (@tomgara) August 30, 2019\n\nWho gave Joe Walsh @Jack's twitter password? \u2014 Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) August 30, 2019\n\nHey @TwitterSupport, I know it's a lazy Friday afternoon... but you might want to crack down @Jack's hacked account. \u2014 Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) August 30, 2019\n\nImagine getting hacked on the website you created pic.twitter.com/K0DhpvZIy4 \u2014 Ben McDonald (@Bmac0507) August 30, 2019\n\nIt is still unclear how these individuals got access to Jack's account nor, if they still do have control his Twitter. Some of the tweets have been deleted, but most are still up. While these tweets were clearly juvenile, there will likely be many questions as to how this happened and whether or not there is any actual security on the social media website.\n\nIt appears Twitter's engineers are on the case:", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:15:20AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/248/63357243-b17f-4c5f-b02a-d900dfcc3d97.jpg"}
