Every nook and cranny of the map has an adventure or memory I can recall from playing the game with my wife on the Nintendo Switch. It took 65 hours of work over six weeks in my fathers shop to complete the map. It was my first time working with resin/epoxy and now that it\u2019s done, hanging on the office wall behind my desk, I\u2019m happy to say it was an absolute delight to bring that digital realm into the real world.\n\nTo get an idea of just how much work went into it, and how big it is, check out this fancy video Mason made of the map being made:\n\nWhat an absolutely phenomenal project. This thing is a beast, and the detail on the map is just plain awesome.", "description": "Photographer Mason Drumm is also pretty handy with a set of tools, and this winter set out to build one hell of a great tribute to Breath of the Wild....", "authors": ["Stephen Totilo", "Gita Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/a1l0fluhihcvvmpioya1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
