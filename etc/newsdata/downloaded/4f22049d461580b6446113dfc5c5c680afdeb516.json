Kate Brown beat her Republican challenger Knute Buehler by about 120,000 votes in 2018.\n\nHer opponents launched the recall efforts, objecting to a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill that she backed but failed to emerge from the Legislature, and an education tax package that did pass, among other issues.\n\nClarno said that three hours before the deadline to deliver signatures on his \u201cFlush Down Kate Brown\u201d recall petition, chief sponsor Michael Cross delivered nine boxes of petitions to elections officials, along with a form attesting to a \u201ccompleted petition submission estimating 290,000 signatures.\u201d\n\nThe boxes were transferred under lock to the Secure Election Division facility where staff counted 23,926 sheets, Clarno said. Since each sheet cannot contain more than 10 signatures, the submission fell short of the 280,050 signatures necessary to trigger a recall vote, Clarno said.\n\nNo submission was received from the Oregon Republican Party, she said.\n\nOregon GOP Chairman Bill Currier said on KXL radio\u2019s Lars Larson Show that the effort came up short and there are plans to try again, the Statesman Journal newspaper of Salem reported.\n\nThomas Wheatley, a Brown political adviser, said recalls should be used only when an elected official has committed a crime, not when someone disagrees with the policies of the governor or another elected official.\n\n\u201cThe public has sent a clear message: Oregonians don\u2019t want to waste their tax dollars on reckless recalls against Democratic lawmakers who are moving our state forward,\u201d Wheatley said on Twitter.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A pair of recall efforts by Republicans to oust Oregon's Democratic governor, Kate Brown, failed on Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Selsky"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/07/01/oregon_cap_and_trade_75688_c0-55-3016-1814_s1200x700.jpg?2e79f6fbb8f47c538db3e16d380fc211537c5565", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
