But creating scale in the biggest logistics markets and gateways to major population centers allows Prologis to offer \u201cone-stop shopping in big key markets\u201d to more easily meet demand from clients that want to ramp up operations in places such as Southern California or Pennsylvania, he said.\n\nLiberty\u2019s properties include sites in key distribution hubs such as Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley, Houston, Chicago and Southern California.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to grow our presence in the Lehigh Valley for years,\u201d Prologis Chief Investment Office Eugene F. Reilly said on a Monday call with investors. \u201cThe combined portfolio going forward in the Lehigh Valley totals 26 million square feet, with additional land to build 4 million square feet in the future.\u201d\n\nThe deal would give Prologis 5.1 million square feet of developments in progress across the U.S., 1,684 acres of land for future logistics development and nearly 5 million square feet of office space.\n\nThe company intends to sell off about $3.5 billion in assets, including $2.8 billion of nonstrategic logistics properties and $700 million of office properties.\n\nChanges in consumer shopping patterns have been reshaping logistics networks, driving up demand for warehouse space, especially for sites near major population centers as businesses push to deliver goods more quickly to consumers.\n\nThe deals come amid signs that the market for warehousing and distribution space may be leveling off. This year, new building construction is on track to outpace overall demand by about 70 million square feet, according to Cushman & Wakefield, although the real-estate services company said the national average vacancy rate for industrial real estate remained at a historic low of 4.8%.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "description": "Warehouse providers are racing to add scale as the growth of e-commerce drives demand for industrial space near key logistics hubs.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith", "Jennifer.Smith Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121398/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
