Go Bokke!\"\n\nSouth Africa was more than welcoming of Brady's support, captioning the tweet: \"Can't go wrong with the GOAT in your corner.

I wouldn't tag us as favorites, but we have a much more realistic chance.\"\n\nHe added: \"My job is to coach well and the players' job is to play well. We do have the talent and we have worked really hard.\n\n\"That is ultimately what we will be judged on. If we are lucky and we don't get a lot of injuries, we should go deep in the tournament.\"\n\nRead more: These photos of 90-year-old Japanese men competing in full-contact rugby are all the fitness motivation you need\n\nThe Rugby World Cup kicks off on Friday, when hosts Japan take on Russia.", "description": "South Africa take on current world champions New Zealand in its opening game on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d84be6a2e22af4c4710e696-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
