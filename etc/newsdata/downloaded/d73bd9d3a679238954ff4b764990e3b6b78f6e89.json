The government has reduced rebel forces to that single province as it seeks to consolidate its victory in Syria\u2019s brutal eight-year civil war.\n\nThe recent attack is believed to be the first since the U.S. and allied forces conducted retaliatory strikes against the regime in April 2018 for an earlier chemical strike.\n\n\u201cClearly the use of chemical weapons in May shows that the Assad regime is not deterred from using them,\u201d said Mr. Rayburn. The regime has used chemical weapons in the country\u2019s civil war more than 300 times over just the past five years, according to 2019 data.\n\nExperts warn that while the Trump administration\u2019s retaliatory strike to the chemical weapons attack was forceful, it is unlikely to make the Assad regime change its ways.\n\n\u201cThe next time \u2026 the Assad regime uses chemical weapons against civilians, the strike must be much harder than it was,\u201d said Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a Washington-based anti-Assad advocacy group.\n\nHe called former President Barack Obama\u2019s response to prior chemical weapons attacks by Mr. Assad\u2019s forces a \u201cdisaster,\u201d but pointed out that Mr. Trump\u2019s second response to an attack was \u201ceven weaker\u201d than the first.\n\n\u201cWe need to up the price with the Assad regime to ensure that never happens again,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
