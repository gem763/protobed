Some lawmakers have vowed to physically resist any attempt to send them home.\n\nThe opposition party that controls Congress - led by jailed former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori - says Vizcarra cannot override Congress\u2019 constitutional authority to name new members of the TC.\n\n\u201cClose Congress, we\u2019re not afraid,\u201d Congressman Gilbert Violeta said in a debate marked by shouting, fist-pounding and a brief attempt to shut out Vizcarra\u2019s prime minister.\n\nDespite Prime Minister Salvador del Solar\u2019s last-minute appeal to heed Vizcarra\u2019s calls, lawmakers elected one new nominee to the TC, Gonzalo Ortiz de Zevallos, a relative of the president of Congress with no judicial experience listed on his LinkedIn profile.\n\nBut Congress suspended debate on other proposed justices until later on Monday, when a vote of confidence will also be held on Vizcarra\u2019s government over the matter.\n\nUnder Peru\u2019s constitution, presidents can dissolve Congress to call new elections if the lawmakers deliver two votes of no-confidence in a government. The current Congress has already voted once that it had no confidence in the government.\n\nVizcarra told local TV channel America Television late on Sunday that he would count the election of new members of the TC as a vote of no-confidence and proceed to close Congress \u201cin strict application of the constitution.\u201d\n\nIf he follows through with the threat, lawmakers might try to impeach Vizcarra. In the Congress of 130 seats, 87 votes would be needed to oust Vizcarra in an impeachment, the same number of votes that officially elected Ortiz to the TC, though leftist lawmakers questioned whether the tally was legitimate.\n\nRelated Coverage Peru's Vizcarra announces he is dissolving Congress\n\n\u201cLet them impeach me if they have the votes,\u201d Vizcarra told America Television on Sunday, ruling out stepping down.\n\nA former vice president, Vizcarra has emerged as an unlikely champion of efforts to uproot corruption since taking office last year to replace former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who stepped down in a graft scandal involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht.\n\nVizcarra is barred from running in the next presidential election due to constitutional limits on consecutive terms. He proposed a snap election that would have ended his term and Congress\u2019 term a year before they were due to end. But lawmakers shelved that proposal last week.", "description": "Peru's opposition-run Congress defied President Martin Vizcarra's threat to close it by electing the first of up to six new leading court justices in a raucous vote on Monday, bringing the nation to the brink of a constitutional crisis.", "authors": ["Mitra Taj", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435673636&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1GY", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
