To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\"\n\nPrince Harry compares 'malicious' media coverage of Duchess Meghan to late Princess Diana\n\nHe continued: \"My deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\nContributing: Anika Reed", "description": "Duchess Meghan's treatment in the British press has inspired 72 female members of Parliament to come together in support of the former \"Suits\" star.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/25/USAT/e13d1215-728c-466c-8359-7847033f0949-GTY_1177989330.JPG?crop=5567,3131,x0,y283&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
