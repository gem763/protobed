(Bruno Kelly/Reuters)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe Brazilian modernist Roberto Burle Marx was a creative dynamo, as the 240,000 visitors to the New York Botanical Garden\u2019s major show this summer discovered. He was a landscape architect, a painter, a ceramist, a textile artist and more. But it was his other and lesser-known incarnations, as a plant explorer and conservationist, that came sharply into focus as the exhibition played out in the botanical garden\u2019s grounds, conservatories and galleries in the Bronx. The reason: The Amazon is on fire.\n\nThe show, which ended Sept. 29, was several years in the making but came together, poignantly and ironically, as the world learned that this year\u2019s clearing and burning of the Amazon rainforest was occurring at alarming levels.\n\n[The Amazon is burning]\n\nThe exhibition\u2019s character, thus, shifted somewhat in late summer, from principally a celebration of an artist\u2019s lust for life to a reminder that Burle Marx\u2019s love of the natural world fueled not only his garden designs and paintings, but also his rage at those who have considered the Amazon and other habitats a natural resource to be exploited.\n\nDeforestation, he wrote, \u201crepresents an attack on humanity, an affront to the sources of life, and an assured means of destroying future generations.\u201d This was in 1969, long before greenhouse gases and climate change became the dominant ecological paradigm.\n\n\n\nRoberto Burle Marx during a botanical expedition in Ecuador in 1974. (Luiz Knud Correia de Ara\u00fajo)\n\nThe heart of the botanical garden show was an outdoor garden paying homage to Burle Marx\u2019s design for Rio\u2019s Copacabana Beach and other commissions, with broad, patterned paths winding through groves of palm trees. But within the more subdued, indoor ecological displays, the curators added signs reflecting the current furor. One of them noted that by late August, the number of fires was its highest on record, more than 80 percent above last year\u2019s level, and that the \u201closs of forest to these fires will displace people and animals, negatively affect air quality in the region, change rain patterns on a continental scale and reduce the forest\u2019s capacity to clean air for the planet.\u201d\n\n[The creative world of a Brazilian artist and landscape architect]\n\nThe issue came to a head in August, when the scale of this year\u2019s fires \u2014 reportedly as many as 70,000 \u2014 prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to refer to the conflagration as an international crisis.\n\nThe dry-season burning of the Brazilian Amazon between May and October is not new \u2014 early 19th-century explorers were horrified to see colonists and indigenous people alike setting the Amazon ablaze. A century later, large areas were cleared for roads and telegraph lines. The land since has been consistently deforested for farming, ranching, logging and mining.\n\nBut Burle Marx, who died in 1994 at 84, was instrumental in getting Brazilians to see the Amazon as a natural treasure to be protected, and new environmental laws and enforcement reduced the rate of fire-clearing for a while. It has picked up in recent years, and especially since January, when the populist far-right President Jair Bolsonaro took office. Critics say he has championed land-clearing while weakening environmental enforcement. The head of the country\u2019s National Institute for Space Research was fired after releasing data showing the surge in this year\u2019s forest fires.\n\nBolsonaro was in New York recently, but not to see the Burle Marx exhibition. He could be found in Manhattan, addressing the United Nations General Assembly. He defiantly asserted that the Amazon devastation had been hyped by the media and accused foreign critics of being \u201ccolonialist.\u201d\n\nThe show, \u201cBrazilian Modern: The Living Art of Roberto Burle Marx,\u201d opened June 8 and seemed a good fit for the botanical garden. Scientists at the institution have been going to Brazil since the late 19th century to survey the country\u2019s flora. One big concern, said Douglas Daly, the garden\u2019s curator of Amazonian botany, is that \u201cthe rains will come at some point, and then people will lose interest and when the dry season comes again next year, it will be that much worse.\u201d\n\nThe current outcry recalls one 43 years ago, when Burle Marx spoke out against the then-military regime\u2019s policy of clearing swaths of the Amazon for infrastructure and agriculture as a way of cementing Brazil\u2019s territorial sovereignty. The regime gave tax incentives to multinational corporations to undertake agricultural ventures, resulting in some odd corporate roles. Volkswagen of Brazil acquired 540 square miles of Amazon forest as an experimental cattle ranch and was entitled to clear half of it for pasture.\n\nThe initial burning of Volkswagen\u2019s Fazenda Cristalino could be seen from space, prompting Burle Marx, in testimony to the Brazilian senate, to rail against the clearing but also to overstate its magnitude. VW asked him to correct the record. Instead, he wrote to the company\u2019s head, Wolfgang Sauer. His scathing response is recounted in the exhibition catalogue by Catherine Seavitt Nordenson, a landscape architect who teaches at the City College of New York.\n\n\u201cI will never make such a denial. . . . In addition to \u2018weeds,\u2019 it is likely that the fire also burned \u2018noisy\u2019 macaws, \u2018filthy\u2019 armadillos, \u2018vicious\u2019 jaguars, \u2018venomous\u2019 snakes, certainly large trees and perhaps even some \u2018treacherous\u2019 Indian,\u201d Burle Marx wrote.\n\n\n\nA visitor walks through the New York Botanical Garden\u2019s \u201cModern Garden\u201d on a path inspired by Roberto Burle Marx's work. (Marlon Co/New York Botanical Garden)\n\nThe argument against Amazon burning today is framed by climate change \u2014 burning releases carbon into the atmosphere that the trees captured over their lifetimes. Each tree that is felled diminishes the Amazon\u2019s role as a carbon sink.\n\nWhat is not so obvious, perhaps, is that the clearing also reduces habitats that plant and animal species rely on. Burle Marx viewed this loss as \u201cecological genocide,\u201d Seavitt Nordenson writes.\n\nCompounding the problem, Daly says, is that only a portion of the plants in the Amazon have been identified by scientists and many that have been described are now known to have been wrongly classified.\n\n\u201cThere are relatively few ecologists for the size of the area,\u201d Daly says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what we are losing.\u201d\n\nDaly has studied Brazilian flora for more than 40 years and is also the director of the garden\u2019s Institute of Systematic Botany. Late last month, he traveled to Rondonia, the northern state where the fires are concentrated, to gauge the impact. He is also training local teams of biologists to improve the identification and inventory of plant species.\n\nSeavitt Nordenson credits Burle Marx with getting his compatriots to understand the intrinsic value of the Amazon. Still, almost one-fifth of the rainforest has been cleared since the 1970s, and the fear of some scientists is that further loss will lead to a tipping point in which the entire ecosystem begins to collapse.\n\nGlobal attention has been on the Amazon, but the exhibition and Burle Marx\u2019s attentions were also focused on the country\u2019s two other major biomes \u2014 the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado. The Cerrado is a high savanna, with dry forests and shrub lands, and occupies a quarter of Brazil\u2019s land area. It looks rocky and barren, but Burle Marx did much of his plant collecting there, discovering close to 50 species. He championed the use of such native vegetation in his plant designs.\n\n\n\nA Brazilian soldier puts out fires at the Nova Fronteira region in Novo Progresso, Brazil, on Sept. 3. (Leo Correa/AP)\n\nThe Cerrado has undergone its own environmental losses, Daly says, as farmers tapped deep wells and amended the soil to negate the effects of toxic levels of aluminum. He wrote in the catalogue that \u201cthe natural vegetation of some 30 percent of the enormous state of Mato Grosso was converted to soybeans in the space of ten years in the early 2000s.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the Atlantic Forest, home to 70 percent of the Brazilian population, has seen the highest percentage of environmental degradation, Daly writes. Only 5 percent of its original vegetation remains.\n\n\u201cYou look at the Atlantic Forest and you see what\u2019s coming up for the Amazon,\u201d he says.\n\nPerhaps the greatest lesson from Burle Marx is that environmental destruction doesn\u2019t just lead to the loss of species or harm natural systems or affect global warming. It degrades our relationship with nature and our sense of place within it.\n\nIf Burle Marx were alive today, \u201che would make the most eloquent and passionate entreaties to anyone and everyone who would listen,\u201d says Todd Forrest, the botanical garden\u2019s vice president for horticulture and living collections.\n\nBurle Marx, he adds, would remind people that climate change isn\u2019t just about how \u201cwe can somehow figure out how to live in a world of increased carbon and then all would be fine. He would argue all the other things that are lost. And the loss of that life profoundly erodes the joyfulness of human existence.\u201d\n\n@adrian_higgins on Twitter", "description": "An exhibition celebrating the late conservationist became a reminder of his rage toward deforestation.", "authors": ["Adrian Higgins", "Gardening Columnist", "October At Am", "Adrian Higgins Has Been Writing About Gardening", "Landscape Design", "Related Environmental Topics Since The Late He Joined The Washington Post In He Is The Author Of Several Books", "Including The", "Washington Post Garden Book", "Chanticleer", "A Pleasure Garden."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RejallLud0aaJO_F7BAwFXTfpss=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ACKMYZXEO4I6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg"}
