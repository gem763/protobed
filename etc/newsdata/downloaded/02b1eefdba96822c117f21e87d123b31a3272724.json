Jeffries pointed out that despite the aid package having both bipartisan support from Congress and support from the Department of Defense, the money was not delivered to the Ukrainian government. Jeffries went on to point out that it was not until after the July 25 phone call between between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the aid was received by the Ukrainian government.\n\n.@ABC EXCLUSIVE: Attorney representing whistleblower who sounded the alarm on Pres.

More than 300 national security professionals have expressed public support for the impeachment inquiry, and both the general council to the CIA and the inspector general to the Intelligence Community -- who are each Trump appointees -- expressed concern over Trump's actions and the whistleblower's complaint.\n\n\"The question has to be asked,\" Jeffries told Stephanopoulos. \"If Donald Trump has nothing to hide, why does he continue to hide information, hide documents, hide evidence from the American people?\"\n\nTrump abused his power by pressuring a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election #UkraineScandal.

Gun. https://t.co/THekkXxurP \u2014 Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries) October 5, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview that Trump is \"scared\" of the impeachment inquiry because he \"knows the argument can be made against him,\" she said.\n\nWhen pressed if House Democrats are focusing too much on the impeachment inquiry rather than the American people, Jeffries said House Democrats are focusing on both.\n\n\"We will not be distracted by our constitutional responsibility,\" said Jeffries, promising that House Democrats are also focused on passing bills and not just the impeachment inquiry. \"That will proceed on a separate track.\"\n\nWhile the impeachment inquiry has been underway for the last three weeks, Democrats have simultaneously been introducing and passing bills that deal with issues such as health care, gun control and infrastructure. In late September, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House Democrats held a press conference for the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which is legislation that is meant to lower drug prices for all Americans.\n\nThis coming week, though the House is in recess, State Department officials are set to appear before the House Intelligence Committee. According to congressional sources, Marie Yovanovitch, the former Ukraine ambassador, and the U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland are expected to appear before lawmakers.\n\n(MORE: House Democrats subpoena White House for documents in impeachment investigation)\n\nJeffries urged that House Democrats will continue following the facts as the impeachment inquiry continues, telling Stephanopoulos, \"this is as serious as it gets.\"", "description": "Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus Rep.
