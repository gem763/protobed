The deal, which values the company at US$8 billion\u2014compared to January\u2019s US$47 billion from SoftBank\u2014will see Neumann step down from the board and cut most of his ties with the company. SoftBank will also spend up to US$3 billion buying out shares from other employees and investors. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nTalking point: This is the biggest change at the embattled office-rental company since Neumann was ousted as CEO in late September, following the firm\u2019s failed IPO and a wave of criticism over his leadership. The credit offer is a major component of the deal, since Neumann had a line of credit tied to his stock in the company when it was worth much more than it is today. The turbulent six weeks that led to the IPO\u2019s cancellation will soon be the subject of a documentary. Meanwhile, a cash shortage spurred by the failed IPO has reportedly led the firm to delay its plans to lay off thousands of employees earlier this month\u2014many of whom were paid partially in shares\u2014because it couldn\u2019t afford the severance costs.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
