They are very much reliant on cash. The rise in contactless technology risks leaving behind rural and poorer communities.\"\n\nHigh credit card interest rates, and a safety-first approach from consumers, mean that the growth in outstanding credit card debt has slowed in recent months.\n\nThe UK Finance figures show that the annual growth rate stood at 3.67% in July.\n\nThis was down from a recent high of 8.3% in February last year.\n\nCommentators have suggested the Bank of England's base interest rate could be cut in the near future, but such a change might not feed through to better deals for borrowers.", "description": "Industry figures reveal the 50% mark has been reached for the first time as the way we pay changes.", "authors": ["Kevin Peachey", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18091/production/_109194489_8e80jitc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
