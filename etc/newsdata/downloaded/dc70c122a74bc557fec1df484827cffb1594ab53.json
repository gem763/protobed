I got told I had Polycystic ovary syndrome. [It has taken] over 11 years I've been hospitalised maybe 50 times.\n\n'It makes me feel angry but also worried about all the other women out there that are currently struggling.'\n\nShe went on to admit that she's 'collapsed in the street' due to her awful pain and questioned why there's so much research in to condition such as diabetes which affects one in 16 people, and not endometriosis.\n\nBex compared her pain to 'sitting on a hot knife' and revealed it took her eleven years to know what her condition was, with doctors originally thinking she had Polycystic ovary syndrome\n\nShe said: 'I think society doesn't take women's pain as seriously as they should a lot of the time.\n\n'There's so much research and funding around diabetes but why, if it's affecting the same amount of people, do we not having any more funding but behind it? We don't even have a cure yet.'\n\nSadie, who was originally told her condition was IBS, revealed that she's unable to use tampons because her illness is so painful - and compared it to someone 'squeezing' her internal organs.\n\nThe video attempted to visually demonstrate the painful condition, which causes painful periods, pain with intercourse, pain with bowel movements or urination, inflammation, excessive bleeding and infertility\n\nShe said: 'Putting your hand up inside you and someone's squeezing all your organs. I can't wear tampons because they're too painful.'\n\nIt took doctors 15-years to realise that Sadie had Endometriosis and feels that the condition should be taught in schools when pupils learn about periods.\n\nShe said: 'I've seen doctors who have never heard of it.\n\nWhat is endometriosis? How the disorder results in pelvic pain and internal scarring Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus - the endometrium - grows outside the uterus. It most commonly affects the ovaries, Fallopian tubes and the tissue lining the pelvis. The primary symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain although many women also experience cramping during their menstrual cycle. Symptoms also include painful periods, pain with intercourse, pain with bowel movements or urination, inflammation, excessive bleeding and infertility. Often misdiagnosed, many women only discover they have the condition during infertility treatment. Approximately half of women diagnosed with endometriosis have difficulty getting pregnant. While studies about the link between endometriosis and miscarriages are still ongoing, newer research suggests that the condition can leave sufferers at greater risk of having a miscarriage.

I've seen in the region of about 50 doctors\n\n'Why is it during sex education you never learn about this condition?'\n\nRebekah was also told that her condition was IBS, and confessed that sometimes her pain is so intense it causes her to vomit.\n\nShe said that her pain is 'like someone's getting a knife and just whipping it round on the inside. There have been times I've vomited just because it's so much on my body.\n\n'It's ten years of the same symptoms just getting progressively worse and no real investigation as to why.\n\nSadie, who was originally told her condition was IBS, revealed that she's unable to use tampons as her illness is so painful and it took 15-years to diagnose her condition\n\nRebekah was also told that her condition was IBS and confessed that sometimes her pain is so intense it causes her to vomit\n\n'This year? five times I've been in hospital A&A because of pain.'\n\nShe feels that women are made to feel as though their pain is natural, and shouldn't be spoken about, insisting that she shouldn't have to 'fight with her doctor'.\n\nShe said: 'Why there isn't more knowledge about this within health care professionals?\n\n'I find myself a lot of the time explaining what Endometriosis is and how it affects me to doctors.\n\n'I constantly feel like I have to fight. I'm fighting with my own body every single day as it is I shouldn't have to fight with the doctor.'", "description": "Three women from the UK have revealed what it's like living with Endometriosis, with one claiming her pain is so severe it's like 'sitting on a hot knife', and another saying she 'collapsed' in the street", "authors": ["Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/15/19400664-0-image-a-43_1570459727738.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
