The guest speaker at a gala dinner at the club planned for 2 April had pulled out and a replacement was needed. The problem was this was no ordinary dinner. It was the centrepiece of a weekend celebrating 150 years of rugby in Japan, which arrived in the country five years before the creation of the Rugby Football Union.\n\nMore of the emergency stand-in later but fast forward to last week as Japan kickstarted its buildup to the World Cup with the unveiling of a memorial plaque in Yokohama\u2019s Chinatown area, close to where the then Yokohama Foot Ball Club held its first meeting.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: Japan team guide Read more\n\n\u201cBuilding the monument will help create a new [understanding of] history in Yokohama, with the city expected to draw attention from the world in two weeks,\u201d the Kanagawa governor Yuji Kuroiwa said.\n\nThe plaque was official confirmation from those who run the game that Japan\u2019s rugby history was considerably older than previously recognised, while the ceremony was a fitting start to the festivities for the World Cup, the origins of which are as blurred by urban myth as the birth of the game in Japan.\n\nThe late Katsuhiko Oku, a diplomat with the United Nations who had played rugby for Oxford University, is often credited as being the first person to lobby for Japan to host a World Cup in his role as a member of the international committee of the JRFU. However, his hopes were known to only a few and were certainly not official policy until 2003, the same year Oku was assassinated in Iraq.\n\nThe reality was apparently a slightly more off-the-cuff move. \u201cI remember [former] chairman Nobby Mashimo wanted to say something \u201cbig\u201d at a new year\u2019s speech [to the press] in 2003,\u201d says Koji Tokumasu, a director of the World Cup 2019 organising committee. \u201cI suggested he say Japan wants to host the World Cup. I called [former International Rugby Board chief executive] Mike Miller and asked what he thought. He said: \u2018It\u2019s not impossible\u2019 \u2013 and it sort of went from there.\u201d\n\nJapan lost out to New Zealand for the right to host the 2011 World Cup. Despair, however, turned to joy when Japan was awarded this year\u2019s tournament, turning the spotlight on the sport in the country and prompting renewed delving into its origins.\n\nThe long-accepted view had always been that the sport was first introduced to Japan by Edward Bramwell Clarke and Ginnosuke Tanaka to students at Keio University.\n\nThe two Cambridge graduates wanted to give their students something constructive to do to \u201ckeep them from idling and wasting the lovely autumn weather\u201d and started a rugby club in 1899.\n\nOn 7 December 1901, Keio played the YC&AC \u2013 an amalgamation of the Yokohama football (rugby), athletics, baseball, cricket and tennis clubs \u2013 and the sport eventually spread to some of the other top educational establishments.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The first Japan national rugby team jersey, worn in 1930.

Two years later, Japan hosted its first Test match when the home side defeated Canada 9-8 in Osaka.\n\nIn 1948 the national corporate championship began with three teams vying for the title. The competition continued until 2003 when it was absorbed by the Top League.\n\nBut back to the early days, and historian Mike Galbraith has proved that the \u201cKeio story\u201d is not 100% accurate when it comes to the origins of rugby in Japan and his research has shown that \u201cfootball\u201d was being played in Japan as early as 1863, the year cricket was formally introduced to the country.\n\n\u201cI am very glad that my efforts bore fruit 10 years after I discovered the history,\u201d Galbraith told reporters after the unveiling of the plaque in September.\n\nAccording to Galbraith, Sir Harry Holdsworth Rawson, the governor-general of New South Wales in Australia, gave a speech in 1908 describing the first game of cricket in Japan \u2013 \u201cA remarkable feature of which was the fact that half the players were playing football.\u201d\n\nThat game was played between a Royal Navy team drawn from officers on ships sent to protect British expats in Japan and those under their protection following a declaration by Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi that foreigners who ignored his order to leave Japan should be killed.\n\nWith the garrison at Yokohama strengthened, it soon became commonplace for the soldiers stationed there to play rugby against civilians \u2013 who may well have included Clarke\u2019s father who was a baker in the small port town \u2013 culminating two years later in the formation of the Yokohama Foot Ball Club.\n\n\u201cAs we happen to have two or three Rugby and Winchester men in the community, we may be certain that we shall have really good scientific play,\u201d said an editorial in the Japan Times dated 26 January 1866.\n\nHence the dinner 150 years later and the urgent call for a guest speaker who could represent the history of rugby in Japan. A history that incorporated its expat beginnings, its development and the eventual rise of the national team to one that caused one of the biggest upsets sport has ever seen with the win over South Africa at the 2015 World Cup.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eddie Jones celebrates with Suntory Sungoriath after winning the All-Japan Rugby Championship Final in February 2011.

It is fair to say, with close to 500,000 foreign fans expected to hit Japanese shores for the World Cup, that not only local rugby fans but the population as a whole are about to get their own taste of what rugby is all about.", "description": "Japan has been enjoying rugby long before the World Cup arrives on its shores but its history is blurred by urban myths", "authors": ["Rich Freeman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17b125297bb28d995196f470ff55741363bb49a1/0_329_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d51c742a06cf5e23eececbb9512d666b", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
