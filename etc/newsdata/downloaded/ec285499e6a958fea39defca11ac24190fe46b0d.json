His move to call a general election was not successful after Labour whipped its MPs to abstain from the vote.\n\nImage caption The i newspaper also says the PM has been \"cornered\". Before the government lost the vote on whether to call an election, MPs backed a bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit if the PM has not agreed a plan with the EU.\n\nImage caption The Financial Times completes a triple-corner effect created by like-minded headline writers with its offering \"Johnson backed into corner as Commons delivers double below\". It says Mr Johnson suffered a \"humbling double defeat\" that leaves him \"in effect, trapped in 10 Downing Street by a hostile Parliament\".\n\nImage caption \"Boris Johnson is facing an increasingly desperate battle to force a general election as his enemies plot to trap him in office but without power,\" says the Times. A photo of the prime minister and his political strategist Dominic Cummings on what it calls \"another bruising day\" features on its front page.\n\nImage caption The Metro responds to the momentous day in parliament with an image of Mr Johnson gesticulating and the headline \"He just can't win\".\n\nImage caption The Mirror uses its front page headline to declare Mr Johnson \"Britain's worst PM (since the last one)\". An image of what the paper calls a \"deflated\" Mr Johnson looking downwards fills the front page, along with an inset photo of Theresa May smiling.\n\nImage caption Not all the papers focus on Mr Johnson. \"'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock\" is the headline on the front page of the Daily Telegraph. An opinion piece by associate editor Camilla Tominey on its front page says Mr Corbyn has been persuaded by \"Brussels-loving Blairites\" to \"capitulate over his long-cherished election\".\n\nImage caption The Daily Mail picks up on Mr Johnson calling the Labour leader a \"chicken\" in the Commons, using the headline \"Corbyn chickens out of an election\".\n\nImage caption Not missing the opportunity, the Sun goes a little further - superimposed a photo of Mr Corbyn's face onto a picture of a red rooster. As the paper declares \"Corbyn clucks up Brexit\", its main headline asks: \"Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?\"\n\nImage copyright BBB Image caption \"Boris urges 'people power' to force election\" is the headline on the front of the Daily Express. The tabloid calls Mr Corbyn's decision not to support a general election yet \"an extraordinary act of cowardice\".\n\nImage caption Finally, the Daily Star's front page carries a story about Alison Hammond, presenter on ITV's This Morning, who told viewers she had to stop breastfeeding her son after \"nearly killing him with her mammoth boobs\".\n\nMany of the front pages - including the Guardian, the Financial Times and the i newspaper - describe Mr Johnson as being \"cornered\".\n\nThe Financial Times talks of \"humbling\" defeats for the prime minister as well as \"growing anger\" among Tory MPs about his handling of Brexit.\n\nFor the Times, he faces an increasingly desperate battle to force an election, with his enemies plotting to trap him in office but without power.\n\nYet writing inside, Jenni Russel argues that even though No 10 may not have foreseen the scale and the seriousness of the Conservative rebellion, Downing Street's strategy may still be on course.\n\nShe thinks the calculation is that voters in swing towns won't care about the absence of the likes of Ken Clarke - and that Jeremy Corbyn will not be able to resist the appeal of a general election for long.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The Financial Times describes Boris Johnson's defeats in the Commons as \"humiliating\"\n\nThe Sun superimposes the face of Jeremy Corbyn onto the body of a rooster and asks: \"Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?\"\n\nThe Daily Mail calls his decision not to back an election \"the final insult\". The word \"hypocrite\" looms large in the Daily Telegraph headline, while the Matt Cartoon depicts an ad van bearing the slogan: \"Vote Labour - but not just yet\".\n\nThe paper's associate editor, Camilla Tominey, describes Mr Corbyn as \"the campaigning veteran of the loud hailer\" and says that in reality, he relishes the idea of going back to the polls.\n\nShe thinks \"It is the Brussels-loving Blairites in his party who are flapping like battery hens in their bid to block Brexit and force a second referendum.\"\n\nThe Daily Mirror agrees that some senior Labour figures prefer the idea of allowing Mr Johnson to \"limp on\" - believing he would be politically damaged if he were unable to deliver Brexit by Halloween.\n\nWriting in the paper, Kevin Maguire praises the Labour leader for his performance at prime minister's questions. \"Cool, calm and calculating Corbyn contrasted well with his flailing opponent,\" he says.", "description": "Thursday's newspapers react to the prime minister losing a series of votes in the House of Commons.", "authors": ["Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/438B/production/_108619271_guardian.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
