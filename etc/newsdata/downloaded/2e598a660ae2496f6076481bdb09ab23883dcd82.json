The alleged victim claimed the Labour party ignored her numerous official complaints about the matter.\n\nOn Thursday, the man sent a statement to RNZ denying \u201cthe serious allegations made against me\u201d but saying he was resigning due to stress and to avoid distracting from the government\u2019s work.\n\nNew Zealand Labour's president resigns over handling of sexual assault inquiry Read more\n\n\u201cI am cooperating fully with the Dew inquiry that is now under way and will continue to do so, having been assured that this process will be fair to all parties,\u201d the statement said.\n\nScepticism is mounting as to when the prime minister found out about the allegations, and Ardern has been accused of letting down survivors who viewed her as a champion for women\u2019s rights and equality.\n\nArdern has repeatedly said she first became aware of the allegations from reports on Monday, but documents obtained by domestic media show senior Labour figures were sent testimony of the sexual assault allegations last year.\n\nA number of political journalists said the allegations were a critical moment for Ardern\u2019s leadership. Newshub\u2019s Duncan Garner said the idea that the prime minister did not know about the allegations was a \u201cmassive stretch\u201d, while Stuff\u2019s Andrea Vance said the prime minister\u2019s insistence that she did not know was \u201chard to swallow\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister faced a barrage of questions over the issue from the press on Thursday as she announced policies on mental health and the school curriculum.\n\nA QC has been appointed to investigate Labour\u2019s handling of the complaint and is due to report back to Ardern within a month.\n\nOn Wednesday, the party\u2019s president, Nigel Haworth, resigned after emails showed he had been sent testimony detailing the alleged sexual assault last year, despite claiming to have not been told about it.\n\nThere were at least six other complaints against the man relating to misconduct, of which he was cleared by an internal Labour investigation earlier this year.\n\nThe allegations are the worst crisis to face Ardern since she took office in 2017, not least for her strong focus on women\u2019s and young people\u2019s rights.\n\nSpeaking last year at the UN general assembly, she said the #MeToo movement must become \u201cwe too\u201d.\n\nArdern told the assembly: \u201cIt seems surprising that in this modern age we have to recommit ourselves to gender equality, but we do. And I for one will never celebrate the gains we have made for women domestically, while internationally other women and girls experience a lack of the most basic of opportunity and dignity.\u201d", "description": "New Zealand prime minister facing questions as to when she first found out about claims", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1cde99b1885f31c6f1bf7501239ca236a91c145/0_36_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a5b945106ae9e75894c4eb00fa984d1", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
