And even though the company\u2019s array of flavors had disappeared from shelves, they were still available online, and a host of competitors sprouted up with lookalike versions and similar flavors to fill the vacuum. Juul had said that nearly 85 percent of its sales were from mint and other flavors, and that its decision to stop shipping them to stores had dented their sales.\n\nOn Monday, the F.D.A. took action against Juul, sending a warning letter accusing the company of violating federal regulations by promoting its vaping products as a healthier option than cigarettes.\n\nAs for the agency\u2019s decision to prohibit most flavors, Ted Kwong, a Juul spokesman, said the company would comply. \u201cWe strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic health groups have long clamored for strict curbs on e-cigarettes and flavors, especially because they worried that the soaring use among youths was hooking a new generation on nicotine after decades of a decline in smoking rates.", "description": "As vaping-related illnesses spread, President Trump and top health officials met at the White House to discuss ways to keep the products away from teenagers.", "authors": ["Sheila Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/science/11ECIGARETTES/11ECIGARETTES-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
