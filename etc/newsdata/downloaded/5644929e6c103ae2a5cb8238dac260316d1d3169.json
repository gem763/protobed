Cameron Maybin and Clint Frazier homered for good measure in the eighth, and Aroldis Chapman struck out Albert Pujols to end it.\n\nDespite putting 30 players on the injured list this season, New York (100-54) wrapped up first place with eight games to spare and made Aaron Boone the first manager to win 100 games in each of his first two major league seasons.\n\nThe Yankees open the playoffs on Oct. 4, likely against Minnesota, which leads the AL Central, or the wild-card winner.\n\nMasahiro Tanaka (11-8) allowed Kole Calhoun\u2019s homer leading off the fourth. The Angels had just four hits in seven innings off Tanaka, who struck out six and walked one.\n\nBut the Yankees may go to the postseason without their winningest pitcher, Domingo Germ\u00e1n. The 27-year-old right-hander, who is 18-4, was placed on administrative leave under Major League Baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy earlier in the day.\n\nNew York\u2019s 19th AL East title was its first following a run of 13 in 17 years that started in Derek Jeter\u2019s rookie season.\n\nAndrew Heaney (4-6) gave up six runs and five hits in five-plus innings.\n\nBRAVES 5, PHILLIES 4\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. became the second-youngest player in baseball history to hit 40 homers in a season, Freddie Freeman also drove in two runs and Atlanta clinched at least a tie for first place in the NL East with a win over Philadelphia.\n\nThe Braves hold a 9 1/2-game lead over the Washington Nationals, who have played three fewer games and were off Thursday. Atlanta can officially celebrate as soon as Friday with either a victory over the San Francisco Giants or if Washington loses at Miami.\n\nThe Phillies trail Milwaukee by four games in the race for the NL\u2019s second wild-card spot.\n\nMel Ott, who was 20 when he hit 42 homers for the New York Giants in 1940, is the only player younger than Acu\u00f1a to post a 40-homer season.\n\nAaron Nola (12-6) worked five-plus innings, giving up nine hits, two hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\nMark Melancon worked perfect ninth for his 11th save with Atlanta and 12th overall this season.\n\nCARDINALS 5, CUBS 4, 10 INNINGS\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - Matt Carpenter homered in the 10th inning against Craig Kimbrel in the All-Star closer\u2019s return, and St. Louis regrouped after blowing a late lead to beat Chicago.\n\nEmerging ace Jack Flaherty shut down Chicago over eight innings, and despite a tying three-run rally in the ninth, the Cubs dropped a game behind Milwaukee for the second NL wild card and four games behind St. Louis for first place in the NL Central.\n\nCubs slugger Anthony Rizzo provided a jolt in his unexpected return from a sprained right ankle, homering in the third inning to tie the game at 1. But Flaherty was spectacular otherwise, pitching three-hit ball while allowing just the one run and striking out eight.\n\nCarpenter homered to deep center field off Kimbrel (0-3), who was activated from the injured list prior to the game after dealing with right elbow inflammation.\n\nGiovanny Gallegos pitched a perfect 10th for his first save in two chances. Andrew Miller (5-5) recorded the final two outs in the ninth for the victory.\n\nBREWERS 5, PADRES 1\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) - Lorenzo Cain homered before exiting with a sore ankle, Milwaukee pitchers combined to strike out 16 and the Brewers improved their playoff position by beating San Diego.\n\nMilwaukee moved within one game of Washington for the top NL wild-card spot. The Brewers are in the second wild-card slot and three games behind Central-leading St. Louis.\n\nRyan Braun put Milwaukee ahead with an RBI double in the first inning off Joey Lucchesi (10-9). The Brewers added a run in the third when Keston Huira doubled and later scored on Lucchesi\u2019s wild pitch.\n\nEric Hosmer\u2019 homered for San Diego.\n\nFreddy Peralta (7-3) struck out three of the four batters he faced for the win. Josh Hader picked up his 34th save in 40 tries, breaking a franchise record for left-handers previously held by Dan Plesac.\n\nTWINS 8, ROYALS 5\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Nelson Cruz hit two of Minnesota\u2019s four home runs and matched his season high with five RBIs, igniting another impressive power display by the first-place Twins.\n\nThe win over Kansas City kept the Twins\u2019 American League Central lead at four games - with nine games to go.\n\nMiguel San\u00f3 homered and hit the tiebreaking RBI double in the fifth following the ejection of Royals starter Mike Montgomery, who started that inning by giving up a home run to Mitch Garver.\n\nThe Twins trimmed their magic number for clinching the division to six.\n\nLewis Thorpe (4-2) worked four innings for the win. Taylor Rogers recorded his 28th save.\n\nINDIANS 7, TIGERS 0\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Mike Clevinger pitched six shutdown innings, Franmil Reyes homered in his return to the lineup and Cleveland moved into a tie for the second AL wild card with a win over Detroit.\n\nFrancisco Lindor added three hits, and Cleveland matched idle Tampa Bay at 90-63. Both teams trail Oakland by two games for the top spot. The Indians trail Minnesota by four games in the AL Central.\n\nThe Indians defeated the Tigers for the 17th straight time this season to match a franchise record set against Baltimore in 1954. Cleveland won 18 of 19 in the season series and outscored Detroit 116-38\n\nClevinger (12-3) allowed seven hits and struck out six.\n\nStarter Daniel Norris (3-13) allowed one run in three innings for the Tigers, who have the worst record in baseball at 45-107.\n\nThe shutout was the 15th by Cleveland this season, and Detroit was blanked for the 14th time.\n\nRED SOX 5, GIANTS 4\n\nBOSTON (AP) - Eduardo Rodriguez struck out 10 over six innings of two-hit ball, and Xander Bogaerts had a pair of RBI singles to lead Boston over San Francisco.\n\nBrandon Workman picked up his 15th save. Rodriguez (18-6) walked two and allowed one unearned run.\n\nMadison Bumgarner (9-9) lost in his first career start at Fenway Park, giving up five runs on nine hits and two walks in five innings while striking out seven. He allowed the first four Boston batters to reach safely and fell behind 2-1 after one inning.\n\nMARINERS 6, PIRATES 5, 11 INNINGS\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) - Shed Long had three hits, two RBIs and scored the go-ahead run in the 11th on an unusual inning-ending double play as Seattle beat Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Mariners swept the three-game series between last-place teams and sent the Pirates to their sixth straight loss.\n\nLong reached base on first baseman Jose Osuna\u2019s error to start the 11th and Omar Narvaez singled with one out to put runners on the corners. Austin Nola then hit a chopper to second baseman Kevin Kramer - rather than flip the ball to second, he ran at Narvaez, who alertly stopped and began to retreat.\n\nKramer then threw to first, and Narvaez was eventually tagged in a 4-3-6-2 rundown as Long scored. Kramer likely would\u2019ve had no chance to throw home at the start to get Long.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s Jake Elmore had three hits and two RBIs.\n\nBrandon Brennan (3-6) pitched one scoreless inning and rookie Erik Swanson worked around a walk in the 11th for his first career save. Clay Holmes (1-2) took the loss.\n\nBLUE JAYS 8, ORIOLES 4\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) - Cavan Biggio homered and had three RBIs to offset a spectacular, homer-robbing catch by Austin Hays, and Toronto used a six-run seventh inning to beat Baltimore for a three-game sweep.\n\nLourdes Gurriel Jr. also went deep for the Blue Jays, who earned their first sweep at Camden Yards since July 2010.\n\nAfter Biggio and Gurriel homered off Gabriel Ynoa (1-9) within a span of three pitches in the fourth inning, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. sent a drive to center. Hays ran to the warning track, leaped to reach over the 7-foot wall and snagged the ball in the middle of his glove. Upon returning to the ground, Hays pounded his chest three times in succession and yelled with delight.\n\nAnthony Kay (1-0) earned his first major league victory.\n\nTrey Mancini had four hits for the Orioles, who have lost four straight and 15 of 19.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The resilient New York Yankees powered their way to the club's first AL East title since 2012, routing the Los Angeles Angels 9-1 Thursday night behind three RBIs each from old mainstay Brett Gardner and newcomer DJ LeMahieu.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/angels_yankees_baseball_29379_c0-182-4364-2726_s1770x1032.jpg?194e6db63d7928feee7387b328e5231ebaf96c49", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
