Capital expenditures are expected to be $2.75 billion to $2.85 billion for the year, from as high as $3.05 billion, Toronto-based Rogers said Wednesday in a statement. The company also cut its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings and free cash flow.\n\nRogers shares were down 6.5 per cent at $62.05 in morning trade.\n\n\u201cThe downward adjustment primarily reflects faster-than-expected adoption of our new Rogers Infinite unlimited data plans and the related reduction in overage revenue, lower wireless equipment revenue resulting from the highly competitive environment, and certain efficiencies recognized this year on capital expenditures,\u201d the company said.\n\nRogers posted $593 million in net income, or $1.14 a share, for the third quarter, compared with $594 million, or $1.15 a year earlier. Adjusted earnings of $1.19 a share missed the $1.31 estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nRogers shared have dropped 5 per cent this year, trailing its main rivals BCE Inc., up 19 per cent, and Telus Corp., which has risen 6 per cent.\n\nCanadian telecom companies also face political pressure, with the latest federal election campaign targeting the wireless providers for their data plans. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal Party was re-elected Monday with a minority government, pledged to cut wireless services costs by 25 per cent within four years.\n\nThe Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association said that competition is already creating value and lowering data prices.\n\n\u201cWith the vigorous competition among wireless carriers, the cost of wireless data in Canada is already declining significantly,\u201d the association said in an emailed statement. \u201cToday, Canadians in every region of the country can get unlimited data plans starting from $50-$75 a month. This is a significant decline in the price of data from just a year ago.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Earnings miss expectations", "authors": ["Doug Alexander", "Divya Balji", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/rogers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
