We have been subconsciously preparing for this game. When you ingrain habits in your players they are easier to sustain, and we saw some great habits from our players tonight.\u201d\n\nJones sees the mental side of the game as key, and much of his work with England over the past four years has been about instilling a sense of calm when under the most extreme pressure.\n\nHis players certainly showed that on Saturday, bursting into a 13-point lead shortly after halftime and, despite gifting reigning champions New Zealand a way back into the match, England showed immense resolve to shut out the All Blacks and see out the win.\n\n\u201cThe psychological process of the game is becoming increasingly important,\u201d explained Jones. \u201cThere is so little difference between the teams so (one needs) to try and understand what gives them energy and take that away from them. Then, for your own team, what gives us energy, what makes us play to our strengths.\n\n\u201cYou have to be disciplined enough to follow that and I think Owen (Farrell) and the other leaders on the field today were exceptional. They kept the team disciplined, kept to our game plan and targeted areas where we thought New Zealand were weak.\u201d\n\nCaptain Farrell, who led the team in tackles alongside playmaking partner George Ford, epitomised England\u2019s combination of ferocious defense and calmness under pressure.\n\n\u201cThe feeling was of calm going into the game and building up into it. We feel in control of what we are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat comes from our preparation and the work we are doing in the week. You can\u2019t fake that out there, especially in a big test match.\n\n\u201cIf you see when they scored points today, that is the calmest we were under the posts after that, and that showed in our next actions.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s next actions, indeed, were to score a further six points and move the match beyond New Zealand. As a result Jones, who was Australia\u2019s losing head coach in the 2003 final and technical adviser with the victorious Springboks in 2007, will now be involved in his third World Cup final.\n\n\u201cWe set out four years ago\u2026 I remember our first meeting at Pennyhill Park, our first meeting, we wanted to be the best team in the world and we are not the best team in the world,\u201d said Jones. \u201cBut we have the opportunity to play in the game where we can prove that we are.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Following their momentous 19-7 victory over New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup on Saturday, England are one win away from claiming the trophy for the second time - while Eddie Jones is just 80 minutes away from accomplishing the goal he set when taking over as England coach in\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://japantoday.com/images/japan-today-social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
