Most of those sustained injuries, state radio ORTM reported.\n\nThe government said a lack of respect for construction standards was the likely cause of the collapse.\n\n\u201cThere are many mistakes... at the root of this tragedy. One cannot construct buildings haphazardly,\u201d said security minister General Salif Traore.\n\nAuthorities launched an investigation into the causes of the collapse, the government said on Twitter.\n\nBuilding collapses are common in Bamako, one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, where a construction boom has driven many to be built without permits.", "description": "Fifteen people were confirmed dead after a day of rescue in the remains of a three-storey building which collapsed in Mali's capital Bamako, an official said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425384568&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810YC-OZATP"}
