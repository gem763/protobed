He ended up with 34 percent support in the nationwide poll \u2014 his best CNN poll numbers since he launched his 2020 run back in April.\n\nBiden's support doesn't seem to pull points away from any single candidate, CNN points out. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are about even with their previous CNN poll showings, with 19 and 16 percent, respectively. Still, that's a big drop from Warren's peak 29 percent in a Quinnipiac poll earlier this month. Biden's rise also comes as he's dealing with being a major player in President Trump's impeachment investigation, and corresponds with big gains in support among \"moderate and conservative Democrats,\" \"racial and ethnic minorities,\" and \"older voters,\" CNN writes.\n\nNext up in the CNN poll are South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) with 6 percent, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke each at 3 percent. CNN and SRSS surveyed 352 people by landline and 651 by cell phone from Oct. 17\u201322, with a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points.", "description": "Joe Biden is taking his rebound to a new level.After briefly yielding frontrunner status to Sen.
