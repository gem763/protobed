But one of its premises may be real: The multiverse", "language": "en", "text": "In the hit Cartoon Network series \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d clones duke it out in an infinity of endlessly weird universes. But are the show\u2019s seriously outlandish situations based in any scientific truth?\n\nIn the last season alone, the show has toyed with whether it\u2019s possible to delete traumatic memories (kind of), murder someone with a wristwatch-sized laser (nope), target DNA with a nanobot (one day) or wipe out an alien species with a neutrino bomb (yeah, no).\n\nOkay, so it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll be able to transform into a pickle by drinking a special serum anytime soon. Butone of the show\u2019s most beloved premises \u2014 the multi\u00adverse \u2014 is more probable than you might think, science teacher Matt Brady explains in his book, \u201cThe Science of Rick and Morty.\u201d\n\nThe idea that undergirds seemingly endless jokes about infinity is actually rooted in modern physics, and the simplest morsel of multiverse theory is digestible even if it has been ages since you took a physics class.\n\nIt goes like this: We can observe only what we can see, and we need light to do that. We can see about 46.5 billion light-years in any direction because the observable universe has been expanding since the big bang, a theory that says the cosmos began with a giant explosion. Most scientists agree that there\u2019s still space beyond that. You could consider the area beyond what we can observe to be a separate universe, and the area beyond that universe to be a separate universe, and so on.\n\nThe separate universes could expand into infinity in a kind of patchwork quilt that \u201cgoes on forever,\u201d Brady writes. \u201cLiterally forever: it\u2019s infinite. And if it\u2019s infinite, there are bound to be repeats.\u201d\n\nThat concept, first proposed by American theoretical physicist Brian Greene, is called Quilted Multiverse.\n\nMultiverse theory gets only more complicated from there \u2014 so complicated, it might make you feel like you\u2019re watching mad scientist Rick Sanchez rant and rave.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go feeling like you\u2019re special or anything,\u201d writes Brady, sounding a bit like Sanchez himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re just one of an infinite number of yous. And, honestly, some of them are more interesting than this version is.\u201d\n\nWant to be a citizen scientists? You can zoom into the Zooniverse.\n\nThe sometimes bizarre world of condensed matter physics is interesting. Really.\n\nInstagram shows that the Large Hadron Collider is very photogenic", "description": "New book about the TV series says the scientific theory is actually rooted in modern physics.", "authors": ["Erin Blakemore", "September At Am", "Erin Blakemore Is A Freelance Reporter Based In Boulder", "Colo.", "A Frequent Contributor To The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/o6edeK8sZKHuEXZv3sEpduCvCgA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y3GICNXARYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
