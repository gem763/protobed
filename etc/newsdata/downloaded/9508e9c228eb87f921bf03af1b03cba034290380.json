Applied to a prominent streamer who left the platform the day before, however, it becomes a sign of how Twitch thinks about its biggest personalities. Leaving, to Twitch, seems to mean something like a betrayal. Twitch\u2019s partner badge is one of the harder verifications to get online, and it denotes a level of status on the site. Grzesiek\u2019s announcement was instantly viral and led tens of thousands to the chat on his empty Mixer page.\n\nA spokesperson for Twitch told The Verge that Grzesiek disappearing from search was the result of a bug that happened to also hide a number of different streamers, though it did not say who else was hidden. Twitch said it was working to resolve the issue, and Shroud began surfacing in search results again around 5PM ET on Friday after being absent for about a full day.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Twitch has seemingly made an aggressive move toward a streamer who quit the platform. That honor goes to Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins who left Twitch for Mixer in August. Within hours of his departure, Twitch revoked his partner status, and a couple of weeks later, it accidentally ran porn on his dormant channel. It\u2019s still one of the most popular on the platform; currently, Blevins\u2019 channel has 14.6 million followers, even though he\u2019s exclusively streaming on Mixer.\n\nBlevins is the most popular gamer in the world, and his departure signaled that live-streaming had grown up. Attracting top talent is big business now. The deals that streamers like Blevins are cutting with platforms are worth millions.\n\nThe deals that streamers like Blevins are cutting with platforms are worth millions\n\nTwitch is still the leader in the live-streaming space, but there\u2019s now serious competition for big names and their audiences. It\u2019s also still a compelling place for streamers \u2014 Nick \u201cNick Eh 30\u201d Amyoony joined the platform from YouTube just a few weeks after Blevins left it.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where Twitch will go from here. My guess is that we\u2019re going to see more big-name streamers move onto the platform via its streamer acquisition team, and I think Twitch is going to begin flexing more of its Amazon muscle. We\u2019ll probably see more features like Watch Parties, which allow certain streamers to broadcast Amazon Prime content to their viewers. The next big battleground in the live-streaming wars is over social broadcasting rights, and Amazon has a built-in advantage, thanks to its wealth of content.\n\nTwitch could also start to extend more of the features partners get to its community of affiliates, the people who stream to small-scale communities. (Features like earning revenue from ads, which had previously been the strict provenance of partners, have recently been rolled out to affiliates too.) The reason would be to keep smaller broadcasters \u2014 who make up the majority of the Twitch community \u2014 from leaving their platform for another, smaller one where they might have an easier time building an audience. Discovery is easier when there\u2019s a lower ratio of noise to signal.\n\nUpdate October 25th, 5:00PM ET: Twitch returned a request for comment, saying that Grzesiek was hidden in search because of a bug that also happened to hide a number of other streamers.", "description": "Twitch stripped Michael \"Shroud\" Grzesiek of his verified partner badge and hid his channel on the site\u2019s search after the popular streamer and former Counter-Strike: Global Offensive pro announced yesterday that he was leaving the platform for Mixer.
