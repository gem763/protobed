But Mr Thind claims doctors 'didn't really know what they were doing'.\n\nMr Thind's erection finally went away naturally, but he has been left with possible permanent damage.\n\nNat Thind, 26, bought a Viagra pill over the counter in June and now says he is impotent after doctors 'mutilated' his penis to fix a month-long erection\n\nThe electrician's erection wouldn't subside and become agonising, a condition known as priapism. Doctors tried to treat him for three days\n\nWriting on a GoFundMe page, Mr Thind said: 'In the months following and through speaking to other doctors, I have found that they did not really know what they were doing and it turns out they just \"had a go\".\n\n'In their attempts at surgery they caused severe nerve damage.\n\n'As a result I am now left with a mutilated penis, a numb tip, the inability to get an erection or achieve orgasm, random shooting and burning pains and penile fibrosis.\n\n'Going from having a healthy sex life to no sex life is devastating and is taking its toll on relationships. It is most definitely not easy living with this dark secret that I feel so ashamed of.'\n\nMr Thind took the recommend dose of one Viagra pill on June 17 like he had done many times before, according to Daily Star. His relationship status is unclear.\n\nThe manufacturers of Viagra, Pfizer, say one in 1,000 people who take the pill will have a 'prolonged and sometimes painful erection', pharmacist Superdrug says.\n\nPriapism is when an erection lasts more than four hours, and occurs when the blood that has flowed into the penis and created the erection is unable to flow out again.\n\nDoctors reportedly made two failed attempts to drain the blood from his member using needles, as well as giving him aspirin and blood thinners.\n\nFinally they used a surgical stunt, which is generally used when drugs have failed to work.\n\nShunting, done under general anaesthetic, creates an escape route for the trapped blood to return to the normal circulation.\n\nIt involves putting one or more large needles or a scalpel through the head of the penis to remove clotted blood and to create a route back into the normal circulation.\n\nUp to one in ten patients will have difficulty getting an erection after this procedure, according to The British Association of Urological Surgeons.\n\nMr Thind said he has been left with permanent nerve damage and the inability to get an erection. He said his penis has been left 'mutilated' by doctors\n\nWHAT IS VIAGRA? Viagra was developed in 1998 by accident, after scientists discovered it had benefits for sufferers of erectile dysfunction. Manufactured by Pfizer, the magic blue pills are taken by more than one million men in Britain each year, figures suggest. Most users are in their early to mid 50s, but younger people are starting to take the drugs more often, the pharmaceutical previously said. Until 2013, only the US drug giant had permission to make the pills - costing on average \u00a321.27 for a pack of four. But since its patent expired, rivals have made generic versions containing the same active ingredient, priced at around \u00a31.45 for the same amount of capsules. Celebrities such as Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy magazine, and Hollywood actors Ben Affleck and Ashton Kutcher have previously admitted using Viagra.\n\nThe risk of permanent issues is higher the longer the priapism has persisted, and some patients will require implants to ever have an erection again.\n\nMr Thind said his penis later returned to a flaccid state naturally, but he is now impotent.\n\nHe said: 'I have been living with this for almost four months now, trying to get help and get the treatment I need to get back to a normal life through the NHS, the health service we pay our taxes and national insurance for.\n\n'It is taking its toll on me mentally as well as physically.'\n\nTo try and treat Mr Thind's impotence, he has reportedly been prescribed Viagra to 'see how things go'.\n\nBut he is looking to travel abroad to pay for treatment, including vascular reconstruction, nerve reconstruction and penile reconstruction.\n\nHe is keen to try an experimental treatment that uses his own fat derived stem cells to regenerate the damaged parts of his penis.\n\nHe said: 'I am planning to see a specialist at Ghent University Hospital at my own expense, the NHS are not forthcoming with any help whatsoever.\n\n'I am planning to see a specialist at a state hospital in Munich, again at my own expense.'\n\nMr Thind said on October 5 he had undergone one minor operation to try and 'fix things', but he won't know for a few months whether this will effective.\n\nHe told The Star: 'There's no point in me being depressed about what's happened.'\n\nMailOnline have contacted Pfizer for comment.", "description": "Nat Thind, of Hampshire, took Viagra in June.
