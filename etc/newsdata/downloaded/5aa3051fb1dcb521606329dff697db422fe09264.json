George Walker, Nashville Tennessean\n\nDENVER \u2013 You had to feel a bit for Marcus Mariota as he stood at a podium, sport coat buttoned, ever dignified, as always accepting all the blame while being peppered with questions for which he didn\u2019t have answers.\n\nOnes like: Do you have any idea if you're still going to be the Titans' No. 1 quarterback?\n\n\u201cI don't,\u201d Mariota replied. \"I don't have an idea.\"\n\nThe season felt lost for the Titans on Sunday, buried in offensive ineffectiveness that doesn't appear to have an easy fix. Maybe Mariota was the biggest problem. Maybe he wasn't. But he wasn't the solution.\n\nIt's time for the Titans to see what Ryan Tannehill can do as their full-time starter. If he's not the choice for Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Chargers, he should be.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 6 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nNFL Week 6 winners, losers: Cowboys at a crossroads while Chiefs searching for answers\n\nAwful as things looked Sunday, this season is still salvageable at 2-4. The Titans\u2019 defense is playing well enough to win. It wouldn\u2019t take a juggernaut offense. It\u2019ll just take a capable one.\n\nThe Titans can do capable. They\u2019ve done it before. Tannehill has done capable before.\n\nSo has Mariota, but now feels different. The move to bench him on Sunday, given the uncertainty of his future with the organization, shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. It was a weighty step, perhaps signaling the end of a Titans era, even if in this case it was made more out of desperation than sincere deliberation.\n\nMike Vrabel didn\u2019t have much of a choice. It was past time. That\u2019s how poorly Sunday's shutout loss had devolved for Mariota and a lifeless Titans\u2019 offense. The decision was obvious. By that point, Tannehill couldn\u2019t have possibly been any worse.\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s good to have a player like Tannehill in these situations. He\u2019s a six-year NFL starter, far better and more proven than an average NFL backup. A case could be made that Tannehill was the Titans\u2019 best quarterback upon first being acquired.\n\nAnd now the Titans owe it to their defense, if no one else, to see what Tannehill can do in a more extended audition.\n\nThings can change fast in the NFL, and four of the Titans' next five games are at home. Of three opponents to visit Nissan Stadium before the Titans\u2019 bye week, the Chargers (2-4) and Buccaneers (2-4) look beatable, and the Chiefs (4-2) no longer look unbeatable after back-to-back home losses to AFC South opponents.\n\nIf the Titans can just find a way to crank the volume up on their offense, their defense is good enough to keep them in any game.\n\nWill Mariota get chances to redeem himself? Probably. At some point.\n\nBut in franchise terms, the Titans showed their cards by pulling him. There's no going back. Everything changes now.\n\nYou don\u2019t know, at any level, how easily a slumping quarterback can come back confidence-wise after being benched. In this case, you\u2019ve also got long-term ramifications for an entire team to digest. It becomes far-fetched for anyone to believe the Titans truly view Mariota as a preferable long-term quarterback when they don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s the best option next weekend against the Chargers.\n\nTannehill, at 31 years old, also seems unlikely as a long-term choice. But he\u2019s the best choice right now.\n\nIf you know Mariota isn\u2019t going to be around, why not remove the mystery about Tannehill? Why not see what he can do while healthy and somewhere other than Miami?\n\nThe Titans don\u2019t need a hero necessarily. They need solid quarterbacking.\n\nAnd much better pass protection.\n\nAnd more production at receiver. And tight end.\n\nOn second thought, good luck, Ryan Tannehill.
