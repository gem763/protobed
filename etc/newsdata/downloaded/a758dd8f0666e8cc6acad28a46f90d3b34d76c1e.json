It packs in several improvements over its predecessor: it now has the Digic 8 image processor, the amount of autofocus points has been increased from 49 to 123, it has eye-detecting autofocus (that keeps the focus sharp on people), and it adds the ability to shoot 4K/24p footage. All four of those spec bumps puts the M200 more in line with Canon\u2019s M50, albeit with a more simplified physical interface.\n\nNot much has changed about the look of the M200. It\u2019s still small and has the same 24.1-megapixel APS-C sensor found in the M100. Similarly, this model also has a built-in flash, and its moveable screen can still be flipped 180 degrees to make taking selfies easier.\n\nThe M200\u2019s 4K recording capability sounds attractive, but Engadget notes that it comes with a big caveat: 4K mode records with a 1.6x crop (compared to recording in other resolutions), so you might not be able to easily achieve the proper framing \u2014 especially with the 15-45mm f/4.5-6.3 EF-M lens that comes included with the camera body.\n\nCanon may be counting on the fact that, at the M200\u2019s $549 starting price, it might pull in a few users who typically shoot on smartphones or who are not used to the features of a higher-end camera. The M200 includes a Feature Assistant tool that helps to explain what each camera mode is useful for, which is a great way to wean people off of auto mode and into manual modes that require some toggling but usually result in a better photo. The ability to wirelessly send photos from the camera to your phone or computer is great if you want to quickly post your shots on social media.\n\nAs mentioned, the M200 will cost $549 when it releases in October. It will be available with a white or black body, and it will work with all of Canon\u2019s EF and EF-S lenses. The M100 required the purchase of a $200 adapter to make this possible, so that\u2019s a big perk here.", "description": "If you\u2019re looking for a capable lightweight mirrorless camera, Canon\u2019s new EOS M200 might be a good fit.
