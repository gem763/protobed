The ad rates on OTT players were also rising faster than on platforms like YouTube.\n\nAs Whistle worked to diversify its revenue and acquire the digital studios New Form and Vertical Networks in its push to become profitable, it wanted to make a play for those OTT ad dollars with WhistleTV.\n\nRead more: Whistle is buying media mogul Elisabeth Murdoch's mobile-content studio, Vertical Networks\n\n\"We've been seeing the audience shift to OTT increasing,\" Izzet Asayas, the executive vice president of distribution and sales strategy at Whistle, said. \"Quite frankly, the ad dollars are also moving to the OTT platforms ... We want to make sure that we capture the eyeballs as well as the ad dollars.\"\n\nIzzet Asayas. Whistle\n\nBy 2020, ad spending on OTT platforms in the US is forecast to hit $5 billion, 85% more than the spending levels two years earlier, estimates from the ad-buying group Magna Global show.\n\nOther digital studios have also started programming free-to-air channels on streaming-TV services, including the Roku Channel, Pluto TV, and Xumo. The subscription-sports service FuboTV launched a free network on the Roku Channel, Xumo, and other platforms last month. Otter Media's Gunpowder and Sky debuted a science-fiction channel, DustX, on a number of platforms earlier this year. And Revry, an LGBTQ-plus-focused content company, programs a channel for Pluto TV.\n\nThe millennial-news network Cheddar, the original \"post-cable\" network, is perhaps the most successful example. It started streaming a live linear channel on Sling TV in 2016 and later rented a broadcast spectrum to expand its reach. The company announced its sale to Altice USA for $200 million earlier this year. The company said it was on track to be profitable in 2019.\n\nRead more: Cable TV company Altice USA is buying the streaming-news network Cheddar for $200 million\n\nThese free linear networks typically forgo the carriage fees paid in the traditional TV ecosystem in favor of advertising revenue. There are two main revenue models, Asayas said:\n\nrevenue share\n\ninventory share.\n\nWhistleTV will focus on the latter, since it already has its own ad-sales team. If eight minutes of commercials run in a 22-minute episode on WhistleTV, for example, Whistle might sell six minutes of that inventory, and the rest could go to the OTT platform. Asayas did not reveal the actual inventory split in the upcoming distribution deals.\n\nLinear channels are more expensive to run but can capture more ad dollars\n\nOTT players like Pluto TV, which has about 18 million monthly active users, have smaller potential audiences than platforms like YouTube, which reaches more than 2 billion active users per month.\n\nAnd streaming networks are more expensive to run than channels on YouTube or Snapchat.\n\nAsayas said Whistle had to hire people who knew how to develop content and program for different times of the day, which it didn't need for on demand. It brought on the former Hulu and Warner Bros. exec Griffin Gmelich to oversee the linear OTT push.\n\nWhistle is investing in video players, content-management systems, and other technology to deliver the video feeds.\n\nIt also needed more programming to fill the hours in the day. WhistleTV will be leaning on its library of existing originals and influencer-led content, which will be recut and refreshed to work for linear, as well as programming from some niche sports leagues, movies, and documentaries.\n\n\"Once we move into this space, we want to make sure that we are not leaving anything on the table from programming to monetization to tech,\" Asayas said of the higher investment.\n\nBut there's more ad inventory available in a 24/7 linear channel than in the short form on-demand videos on YouTube.\n\nThe CPMs, a standard ad-buying metric that measures revenue per thousand views, can also be much higher, Asayas said.\n\nA major broadcast network that sells ads direct on OTT platforms can reach CPMs of $35 or more. Programmatic CPMs can be in the double digits. CPMs on YouTube, which vary wildly based on geography and other factors, are often in the single digits, though they can go well into the double digits.\n\nAsayas said Whistle's research suggested the margins on OTT streaming channels could be higher than on social-media channels despite the higher costs.\n\n\"Seeing both from our first-party data as well as third-party data that these OTT platforms having a considerable amount of audience, and the audience that we're targeting, basically made it a no-brainer for us to move into this space,\" Asayas said.", "description": "Digital-entertainment company Whistle is the latest to go over the top with a 24-hour streaming channel, WhistleTV, the company told Business Insider.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da8756b4af9091bbd0ab486?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
