Choudhury has previously been accused of running a \u2018cult\u2019 of sexual harassment and even rape by former students.\n\nPhyllis Main, 62, died under mysterious circumstances in Mexico last week during a \u00a313,000 course in hot yoga taught by disgraced yogi Bikram Choudhury\n\nJust before travelling, she posted on Facebook: \u2018Acapulco tomorrow to become a Bikram Yoga teacher. Love this yoga. If it\u2019s not 90 mins it\u2019s not Bikram Yoga. Will miss you all\u2019\n\nMs Main had updated her social media before and during her trip to Mexico. She is understood to have been given a clean bill of health from her doctor in Glasgow, where she lived.\n\nJust before travelling, she posted on Facebook: \u2018Acapulco tomorrow to become a Bikram Yoga teacher. Love this yoga. If it\u2019s not 90 mins it\u2019s not Bikram Yoga. Will miss you all.\u2019 She later told how she performed yoga \u2018in front of the Boss\u2019, but in a final post this month she said: \u2018Acapulco is beautiful, only wish it had less humidity.\u2019\n\nThe Mail on Sunday understands Ms Main complained of feeling unwell on October 2 but was not taken to hospital until October 14. Her son Ross, who was on holiday in America, arrived at the hospital two days later but her condition suddenly worsened and she was rushed into intensive care, where she died on Monday. Early reports suggest the cause of death was heart failure brought on by sepsis.\n\nMr Main declined to comment to the MoS last night, saying it was \u2018too early\u2019 to discuss his mother\u2019s death. But a source said family members were \u2018devastated and distraught\u2019 over the tragedy and angry that no one from Choudhury\u2019s yoga course staff stayed with Ms Main at the hospital. The source said: \u2018She was basically abandoned.\u2019\n\nThe Mail on Sunday understands Ms Main complained of feeling unwell on October 2 but was not taken to hospital until October 14\n\nA spokesman for Choudhury, 75, said Mexican privacy laws meant his staff were not allowed to be at her hospital bedside.\n\nA fellow student at the Damn Hot yoga studio in Glasgow where Ms Mains was a regular said: \u2018She was extremely good at yoga \u2013 one of the best in the class. She was very, very fit. It\u2019s a shock.\u2019\n\nIndian-born Choudhury built an estimated \u00a360 million fortune from his Bikram Yoga brand, with students undergoing gruelling 90-minute yoga sessions in 105F heat.\n\nBut several woman have accused Choudhury of rape and sexual harassment. In 2016, a judge awarded his former lawyer, Minakshi Jafa-Bodden, \u00a36.4 million in a wrongful dismissal case.\n\nShe was also awarded control of his 700 Bikram studios around the world and the multi-million-pound fleet of 43 cars, including 13 Rolls-Royces, eight Bentleys and three Ferraris, but has yet to see a penny.\n\nLast night Ms Jafa-Bodden said: \u2018My heart goes out to Ms Main\u2019s family. This is a tragedy, but one that I\u2019ve been warning could happen for years. A jury found Bikram guilty of malice, oppression and fraud in my case, and yet he continues to teach unregulated classes around the world. There is a warrant out for his arrest in the US.\n\n\u2018He has no business running anything. His classes are unregulated and poorly run. He runs his company like a cult. The man is a dangerous fraud.\u2019\n\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: \u2018Our staff have provided consular support to the family of a British woman who died in Mexico.\u2019\n\nAdditional reporting: Jake Ryan", "description": "Phyllis Main, 62, died under mysterious circumstances in Mexico last week during a \u00a313,000 course in hot yoga taught by disgraced yogi Bikram Choudhury.", "authors": ["Caroline Graham For The Mail On Sunday In Los Angeles"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/02/20231998-0-image-a-45_1572141604966.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
