It was her 22nd medal at the world championships, putting her just one from the record of Belarus\u2019 Vitaly Scherbo \u2013 who had two more events to collect his, mind you.\n\nOnly Japan\u2019s Kohei Uchimura, with six, has more world titles.\n\nAfter doing her final pose, a grinning Biles pretended to drop a mic. As she should.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Rio Olympics, Biles\u2019 U.S. teammates would joke about the \u201cSimone Division,\u201d an acknowledgment of just how much better she was than everyone else.\n\nA year before the Tokyo Games, the gap has only gotten wider. Biles finished 2.1 points ahead of China\u2019s Tang Xijing, who only made the all-around after Liu Tingting scratched. Angelina Melnikova of Russia was third. American Sunisa Lee, competing in her first world championships, finished eighth.\n\nBiles had a slim 0.033 lead over Belgium\u2019s Nina Derwael after the first rotation, giving faint hope to anyone hoping for an upset. But she shut that down real quick on uneven bars.\n\nYes, her least-favorite and \u201cweakest\u201d event.\n\nThe new skills Biles has added on floor, vault and balance beam in the last year get most of the attention \u2013 rightly so because they have pushed the boundaries of the sport. But improvement on bars under coach Laurent Landi, who coached Madison Kocian to a world title on the event in 2015, has probably been the most dramatic.\n\nShe moves between the bars with confidence, and her dismount \u2013 a double-twisting, double somersault \u2013 was huge. She got several feet above the upper bar yet landed with a solid thud, her feet not moving an inch.\n\nHer score, a 14.733, was the third-highest of the day on the event, and widened her lead over Derwael to more than a point. 1.033, to be exact. And there was no way Derwael was going to get any closer, having started on uneven bars, her best event.\n\nBalance beam has been the curse of many a gymnast at these world championships, but Biles has been solid every routine. Though she didn\u2019t do her new double-double dismount \u2013 why would she when the International Gymnastics Federation isn\u2019t going to value it fairly? \u2013 it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nShe moves across the beam, which is a mere 4 inches wide and 4 feet off the ground, with more assuredness than most mere mortals walk on flat ground. She landed her aerial series as if to say, \u201cOh, is that supposed to be hard?\u201d\n\nBiles had a slight balance check on her split leap, but that\u2019s like quibbling over a brush stroke on a Picasso. Her score of 14.633 increased her lead to 1.3 points, with Tang now in second.\n\nThat left only floor exercise, where Biles is the reigning world and Olympic champion. She did her new triple-twisting, double somersault pass to open, getting such height she had to take a step out of bounds. But it was minor compared with all of the difficulty she packs into the routine.\n\nShe almost fell backward on her final pass, but managed to stay upright.", "description": "It was Simone Biles' 22nd medal at the world championships, putting her just one from the record of Belarus\u2019 Vitaly Scherbo.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
