She, like him, is tough and independent. The daughter of a gangster.\u2019\n\nFilming finished for the movie on 25 October, and No Time To Die is set to be released on 3 April 2020.\n\nFilming on No Time To Die has wrapped (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThe film\u2019s official 007 Instagram account announced that filming had been completed, telling fans: \u2018That\u2019s a wrap on #NoTimeToDie. See you in cinemas April 2020. #Bond25\u2019.\n\nIt will be the fifth and final time Daniel Craig plays Bond, and he thanked the cast and crew for their \u2018hard work\u2019 during the wrap party in Matera, Italy.\n\nHe told them: \u2018I just want to say, and I am really quite drunk now so I won\u2019t go on for long, this has been the best, most wonderful experience I have ever had!\n\nNo Time To Die is Daniel Craig\u2019s last time playing James Bond (Picture: Universal)\n\n\u2018You have all done the most amazing job.

Thank goodness, we did this tonight.\u2019\n\nThe plot of the film is a closely guarded secret, with three endings having been reportedly filmed to avoid details of the finale being leaked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conclusion is so secret, in fact, that not even Daniel knows which ending will be chosen as the only person who knows the fate of Bond is director Cary Joji Fukunaga, who took over the project from Danny Boyle.\n\nNo Time To Die will be released on 3 April, 2020.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
