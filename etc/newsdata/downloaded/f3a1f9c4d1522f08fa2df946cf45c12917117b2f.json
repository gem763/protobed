Mr. Kenney had great success in the 1990s with a string of restaurants, and this dish became a dinner party favorite, of sorts, for Brooklynites of a certain time. The ingredients are few, and the technique simple. So do as Sifton suggests: \u201cGet good organic apples that can hold up to heat and the best coarse-ground polenta and thick, creamy goat cheese you can find. Spend the money for Grade A maple syrup and organic pecans. And spend the time to find the candied ginger, which adds a bright, floral taste to the final dish.\u201d Serve it with these pork chops, another of Mr. Kenney\u2019s dishes.\n\nFeatured in: Off The Menu.", "description": "Sam Sifton brought this recipe, from the chef Matthew Kenney, to The Times in 2009 Mr Kenney had great success in the 1990s with a string of restaurants, and this dish became a dinner party favorite, of sorts, for Brooklynites of a certain time", "authors": ["Sam Sifton", "Craig Claiborne", "Joan Nathan", "Ali Slagle", "Alexa Weibel", "Julia Moskin", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/20/dining/Polenta-With-Goat-Cheese/Polenta-With-Goat-Cheese-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "published_at": "2014-05-20"}
