Especially not during working hours. I texted him back, and he told me I\u2019d been hacked.\n\nMy heart started pounding. I still get nightmares from that story Wired\u2019s Mat Honan wrote when he got hacked, and lost all his personal data. What if someone read my conversations with my girlfriend? Found embarrassing group convos? Got into my work accounts? Or even worse: got into my banking stuff?\n\nI asked my dad what happened, and he started sending me screenshots of a conversation he and I supposedly had on WhatsApp. Initially, I thought someone got into my WhatsApp account, but on closer inspection I realized someone was using my name and picture with a new number. Not a hack, \u2018just\u2019 a simple case of identity fraud.\n\nThe hacker texted my dad to say \u2018I\u2019 accidentally put my phone in the washing machine and got a new number, and that I needed money to pay some outstanding bills. Now this is not something I had ever done before, and the language used wasn\u2019t typical of me either, so my dad immediately suspected something was up, but I can see how a more gullible parent could fall for this scam.\n\nThe conversation between the scammer and my dad\n\nThe social engineering tricks these hackers use are downright devious. A former colleague of mine got attacked earlier this year and tweeted the screenshots, which show how the hackers told his dad that \u2018he\u2019 got a new phone and that his dad could have his old device. It\u2019s pretty unsettling to read such a jovial conversation between a scammer and his victim.\n\nThis attack is extra dangerous in the Netherlands because we have this service called Tikkie, which lets you send people a payment request without having to give your banking details. Usage of this service is extremely common over here, so a potential victim wouldn\u2019t be freaked out by it.\n\nApparently scammers have been using this technique since the beginning of this year. A story by Dutch website RTL Nieuws warns people about this attack, after their newsroom got a bunch of tips from people who got targeted by this scheme. They also interviewed a woman who fell for it and paid a thousand bucks to her hacker.\n\nThe solution is simple; tell your parents not to wire you money without speaking to you first. It might sound like the most obvious thing in the world, but the sophistication of these scams is truly scary and, unlike simple phishing attempts, you can see how someone would fall for this. And it\u2019s a good excuse to call your parents, you know it\u2019s been too long.\n\nRead next: Chemists may have finally solved pollution", "description": "", "authors": ["Nino De Vries"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fgrandmahacker.png&signature=5b6411282e35a6d4fa6f0416aabe4c7b", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
