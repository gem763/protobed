Goldman and Fisher Investments declined to comment to the news outlet.\n\nAnd the Goldman news came not long after Bloomberg reported that the Los Angeles fire and police pension was yanking $511 million from the firm.\n\nThe three investors join Fidelity Investments and five pension funds in divesting from the large RIA following its founder and chairman\u2019s remarks at a closed-door industry summit on Oct. 8. Accounting for Texas, outflows now total more than $3.1 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe decision by Los Angeles on Thursday followed what Bloomberg described as a \u201ccontentious\u201d pension board meeting with Fisher representatives.\n\n\u201cFisher\u2019s words reach millions and only do damage,\u201d Los Angeles pension commissioner Brian Pendleton said at the meeting. \u201cOther pension funds are going to come to the same conclusion and we shouldn\u2019t be the last ones to turn the lights off.\u201d\n\nFisher Investments\u2019 CEO, Damian Ornani, apologized for Ken Fisher. (When the scandal first erupted, Fisher initially expressed surprise his comments had offended listeners; later he issued a full apology.)\n\n\u201cI really apologize sincerely,\u201d Mr. Ornani said at the meeting, according to Bloomberg. \u201cHe does too. He understands what he did. This will not happen again. This is not who Fisher Investments is. This is not who Ken Fisher is.\u201d\n\nBut Adam Nathanson, the president of the pension board asked why Ken Fisher didn\u2019t show up for the meeting and whether he has offered to resign. A representative from the firm said its founder was too important to Fisher Investments to resign.\n\nOne one crisis PR manager tells Financial Advisor IQ that Fisher\u2019s resignation is exactly what\u2019s needed for his firm to staunch the outflow of clients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for him not just to resign, but rather to announce his retirement and, as an author, go to work on his next book with a mea culpa-like theme,\u201d Marco Greenberg, president of Thunder11, tells the publication.\n\n--Ross Snel", "description": "Texas, Goldman Sachs and Los Angeles reportedly join the exodus of institutional clients from Fisher Investments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-120701/social", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
