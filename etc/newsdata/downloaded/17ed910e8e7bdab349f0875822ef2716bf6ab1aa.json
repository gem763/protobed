Calling an election if, in his view, he needs to. When would he need to do that? Soon.\n\nRead more from Laura.\n\nThere is not due to be another general election until 2022.\n\nUnder the Fixed Terms Parliament Act, Mr Johnson would require the backing of two-thirds of the UK's 650 MPs to trigger an early poll this autumn.\n\nShould this happen, the prime minister would be able to recommend the date - likely to be a hugely contentious issue given the looming Brexit deadline - to the Queen.\n\nIf there is an election before the end of 2019, it would be the third in the past five years, after polls in 2015 and 2017.\n\nWhat does the no-deal bill say?\n\nThe legislation to be put forward on Tuesday seeks to tie Boris Johnson's hands, and instructs him to ask the EU for an extension of the Brexit process until 31 January 2020.\n\nA lot of attention will be on the clause which says that if the European Council proposes an extension to a different date, then the prime minister must accept it within two days, unless that extension has been rejected by the House of Commons.\n\nIn other words, the power to decide will lie with members of Parliament not with the government.\n\nFor a PM who has promised to leave on 31 October come what may, it would seem to be impossible to accept.\n\nHence all the talk of an early election. We will know for sure before the end of this week.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage said Parliament was \"doing its damnedest\" to prevent the UK leaving the EU, and his party would be ready for an election.\n\nAt a party event in Colchester, he pledged his party would fight Mr Johnson \"every inch of the way\" at such a poll if he decides to pursue a new deal with the EU.\n\nBut he added his party would do \"everything we can\" to help the prime minister if he decides to seek a mandate for a no-deal departure.\n\n\"They, allied with us, would be unstoppable in a general election,\" he added.", "description": "The PM says he does not want a general election, but he is expected to seek one on 14 October if his opponents succeed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07m8m8k.jpg"}
