You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThese products are still stocked in all these supermarkets, the campaign group has claimed.\n\nDanny Gross, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, told The Independent: \u201cThe world watches in horror as the Amazon burns but unfortunately a lot of us are unwitting contributors to the crisis.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, JBS \u2013 which is the world\u2019s largest meat-packer \u2013 was fined $7.7m (\u00a36.2m) for buying 49,438 cattle raised on illegally deforested land between 2013 and 2016.\n\nBrazil\u2019s environment regulator, Ibama, said the company had turned a blind eye to regulations that were intended to protect the Amazon and had knowingly bought cattle raised on deforested land for years.\n\nAccording to a report by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the company is allegedly continuing to buy cows raised on illegally deforested land, although it denies this. Companies that supply JBS are believed to be responsible for the destruction of up to 32,000 hectares of forest each year, according to data from NGO Trase.\n\nLast year, the UK imported 28,550 tonnes of corned beef, 95 per cent of which came from Brazil, with nearly half supplied by JBS.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fires, Boris Johnson said the UK would do \u201ceverything we possibly can\u201d to help Brazil tackle rainforest destruction.\n\nHowever, asked whether he would join other leaders in opposing a trade deal between South American nations and the EU, he said: \u201cPeople will take any excuse at all to interfere with free trade and to frustrate trade deals, and I don\u2019t want to see that.\u201d\n\nDr Marco Springmann, senior researcher for the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food, told The Independent: \u201cThe UK directly imports about 30,000 tonnes of beef and beef preparations from Brazil. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this means when we eat meat, we have deforestation on our plate.\n\n\u201cIn addition to calling [Brazil\u2019s] government to account, we must call ourselves to account.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He believes environmental laws and activist groups often work to hinder Brazil\u2019s economic potential.\n\nThe demand for animal products is responsible for more than 80 per cent of all deforestation in Brazil and other South American countries, according to experts from Yale.\n\nMr Gross said: \u201cIt\u2019s no good for Boris Johnson to shout about the importance of preserving precious ecosystems while pursuing a trade deal with Brazil which will only add fuel to the Amazon fires. We need to have environmental protection at the heart of international trading relationships.\n\n\u201cThe scandal goes way beyond beef products, with hundreds of thousands of hectares of land in Brazil used to produce soy for UK animal feed,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOur government \u2013 and British companies \u2013 need to ensure that none of the commodities we import are fuelling deforestation overseas. Cutting down on meat consumption is an easy thing people can do to help.\u201d\n\nJBS denied selling meat sourced from farms associated with deforestation.\n\nA spokesperson said: \u201cJBS is committed to a sustainable livestock supply chain and has a zero-deforestation policy for cattle across the Amazon region. We do not allow cattle from farms contributing to Amazon deforestation to enter our supply chain.\n\n\u201cThe JBS Amazon monitoring system covers more than 280,000 square miles, an area larger than Germany, and assesses more than 50,000 potential cattle suppliers every day.\u201d\n\nThe Independent contacted the supermarkets in question for comment.\n\nA spokesperson from Waitrose & Partners said its own-brand corned beef is 100 per cent British.\n\n\u201cPrinces supplies us with its brand of tinned corned beef and has previously responded to these allegations,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWe take deforestation very seriously and would stop working with any supplier that does not share our values or practice the high standards we expect.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson from Princes confirmed the company sourced corned beef products from JBS and has commercial relationships with a number of national retailers.\n\nHowever, the firm denied that the beef came from illegally deforested areas.\n\nThe spokesperson said: \u201cWe require that all Brazilian sourced beef must come from suppliers that undertake and publish annual independent audits to ensure no purchases are made from farms that have illegally deforested native forests in the Amazon biome after October 2009.\u201d\n\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) made a statement on behalf of the supermarkets mentioned, saying: \u201cIllegal deforestation is completely unacceptable, and retailers are collaborating to tackle deforestation and drive greater uptake of certified sustainable products in their supply chains.\n\n\u201cThe retail industry understands consumers need assurance that the products they buy are environmentally responsible and do not contribute to deforestation. Retailers are working with suppliers to move to more sustainable sourcing by providing them with access to training and more information.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, many leading BRC members are signed up to Better Retail Better World which commits them to halting deforestation across all supply chains by 2030.\u201d", "description": "The UK\u2019s most popular supermarkets are selling beef from a meat company associated with illegal deforestation of the Amazon despite an international outcry following recent wildfires,\u00a0according to environmental investigators.
