The mixture of different textures is what makes this one of my favourite salads to prepare and eat. But, as you may know by now, I cannot for the life of me leave any recipe alone! So this is my breakfast version, full of fresh, frozen and dried fruits and seeds, which means loads of variety. Not forgetting the most important part, the crispy bits on top, for which I\u2019ve used toasted cinnamon tortillas.\" - Nadiya Hussain\n\nFruit Salad Fattoush\n\nBy Nadiya Hussain\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the crispy tortillas:\n\n4 small flour tortilla wraps, cut into 1cm pieces\n\n20g unsalted butter, melted\n\n35g brown sugar\n\n\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon\n\nA pinch of salt\n\nFor the fruit salad:\n\n400g fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered\n\n1 large orange, peeled and segmented\n\n125g dried pineapple, roughly chopped (I use scissors, much easier than a knife)\n\n200g green grapes, halved\n\n200g frozen blueberries\n\n150g frozen raspberries\n\n3 passion fruit, halved and pulp spooned out\n\n2 tbsp sunflower seeds\n\n25g fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped\n\nPreparation\n\nBegin by making the crispy bits. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C/180\u00b0C fan/gas mark 6. Place the tortilla pieces in a large baking tray, so they can all sit in a single layer. Pour over the melted butter, then, using your hands, toss the tortillas around so each piece is coated. Sprinkle over the sugar and cinnamon and get in there, making sure everything is coated well. Sprinkle over the salt.\n\nPop into the oven and bake for 10 minutes, making sure to keep a close eye on the tortillas so they don\u2019t burn. Halfway through, take the tray out and turn the pieces around, then put back into the oven for another 5 minutes. You will know they are ready when they make a crunchy sound when dropped on to the tray. If you think they need a little longer, leave them for an extra few minutes, but make sure you still keep an eye on them.\n\nOnce they are crisp, leave them on the tray to cool and dry out a little bit more while you put the salad together.\n\nPut all the salad ingredients into a large bowl and mix together. I like to do this just before serving, so that the frozen fruit stays frozen.\n\nServe in individual bowls and sprinkle those oh so delicious crispy bits over the top.\n\nYield: Makes 8 servings\n\nThis recipe originally appeared on Nadiya's Family Favourites - Series 1.
