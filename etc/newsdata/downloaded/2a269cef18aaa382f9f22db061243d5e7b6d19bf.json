Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is facing backlash over his big rally in Queens over the weekend, with one community leader remarking that it seemed to be a \u201cpretty white\u201d event and others claiming that the Sanders campaign failed to properly reach out to the people of Queens.\n\nSanders held a massive rally at Queensbridge Park on Saturday, which featured special guests Michael Moore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), both of whom gave their formal endorsements.\n\n\u201cWe need a United States that really, truly, and authentically is operated, owned, and decided by working \u2014 and all \u2014 people in the United States of America,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said at the rally.\n\n\u201cThat is what it \u2014 it is multiracial, multigendered, multigenerational, and multigeographic,\u201d she continued, adding, \u201cWe have to come together, not ignoring our differences but listening to them, prioritizing them, understanding injustice.\u201d\n\nSanders appeared to choose Queens, in part, because it is \u201cground zero for the fight for public housing\u201d and home to the country\u2019s \u201clargest public housing project\u201d \u2014 something Ocasio-Cortez highlighted in her speech.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s acknowledge the ground that we are on, which is the ground zero for the fight for public housing and fully funded, dignified housing in the United States of America,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd on Saturday.\n\nHowever, some residents of Queens, particularly residents of the Queensbridge Houses public housing development, say that the Sanders campaign snubbed them.\n\nQueensbridge Tenants Association President April Simpson said the Sanders campaign did not seem to make significant efforts to reach out to Queensbridge residents. She said there were no flyers in the building advertising the event, although the Sanders campaign claims it did, in fact, hand some out.\n\nSimpson said the Sanders campaign did not contact her until the day before the rally, which happened to coincide with the monthly tenant association meeting.\n\n\u201cThese people were coming from near, far \u2014 but they weren\u2019t from Queensbridge,\u201d Simpson told Patch. \u201cThat rally wasn\u2019t for us.\u201d\n\nAs Patch reported:\n\nA Sanders campaign spokesperson said the team handed out flyers to Queensbridge residents going in and out of their buildings on Friday, the day before the rally, and had reached out to Simpson as soon as they got her contact information and invited her to meet with Sanders. But Simpson said she felt slighted. \u201cThe residents that were sitting in the meeting, they said they found out from all the people going past,\u201d Simpson added, calling the lack of outreach \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d\n\nCommunity leader Bishop Mitchell Taylor was also perturbed by the Sanders campaign\u2019s purported lack of outreach and remarked that the event \u201cseemed to be a pretty white rally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey chose a picture over a population,\u201d he said, according to Patch. \u201cHow could you use Queensbridge Park as your rallying point but not engage Queensbridge people as a part of the rally?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the biggest projects in the world, and you didn\u2019t even let the people there know what\u2019s going on in their own neighborhood,\u201d Queensbridge resident Billy Robinson told the outlet.\n\nSimpson told Patch reporter Maya Kaufman that the Sanders campaign reached out to set up a meeting \u201cwith Sanders and Queensbridge community leaders\u201d following the publication of the Patch article. The Sanders campaign maintained that it offered such a meeting the day prior to the rally, but Simpson denies that:\n\nA Sanders campaign spokesperson, who would only speak to me on background, claimed the campaign offered this meeting Friday. Simpson says that isn't true. I've asked for a copy of the flyer the campaign says they handed out Friday by Queensbridge but haven't gotten a response. \u2014 Maya Kaufman (@mayakauf) October 22, 2019\n\nBoth Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have emphasized the need to provide affordable housing for all. Sanders released a $1.5 trillion Housing for All plan which asserts that every American is entitled to a \u201cdecent\u201d home.\n\n\u201cIn the richest country in the history of the world, every American must have a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable home as a fundamental right,\u201d Sanders\u2019 proposal states. \u201cWe need a homes guarantee.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Ocasio-Cortez has put forth a massive \u201canti-poverty\u201d proposal which gives illegal aliens access to public benefits and outlines a protections for renters under \u201cThe Place to Prosper Act.\u201d The act \u201cgives access to a \u2018counsel fund\u2019 for renters who are facing eviction and \u201cimposes a national cap of 3% on annual rent increases and begins to pursue penalties\u201d on what the freshman lawmaker calls \u2018abusive and predatory landlords,'\u201d as Breitbart News reported.", "description": "Sanders is facing backlash over his Queens rally, with one community leader remarking that it seemed to be a \"pretty white\" event.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Bernie-Rally-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
