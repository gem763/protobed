On Tuesday night, CNN's Chris Cuomo accused him of more or less touting \"meaningless\" talking points for the purpose of giving Republicans fodder to discredit Schiff and the Democrats. Well on Wednesday, after the New York Times reported that Rep. Schiff did indeed have early access to the complaint, Fleitz had his day on Twitter and made sure that Cuomo saw the latest news.\n\nDaily Caller reporter and Townhall columnist Scott Morefield broke down the sequence of events from Fleitz's CNN appearance:\n\nDrawing on his own experience with whistleblower complaints, Fleitz told Cuomo he thought this one \u201cwas very unusual.\u201d \"When I saw this one, I thought it was very unusual, not just that it was extremely well written, but it had legal references and footnotes. That was a little bit unusual, but I compared that with the fact that Adam Schiff was talking about the subject matter of this complaint throughout the month of August. He posted a tweet at the end of August that almost identically reflected this complaint. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know any of that,\u201d Cuomo pushed back. \u201cYou\u2019re raising it as questions. You know that is meaningless unless you can put some meat on the bones. Of course the Republicans are agreeing with you. That\u2019s the whole state of play. Anything you say that\u2019s negative about this guy or this woman they\u2019re going to pick up on.\u201d\n\nYou were pretty hard on me last night on @CNN last night @ChrisCuomowhen I told you that I assessed @RepAdamSchiff probably knew about the CIA whistleblower in advance. We now know from the NYT that I was right. Apology not necessary. @realDonaldTrump,\" Fleitz tweeted Wednesday evening.\n\nBut, CNN should apologize. Rather than respect Fleitz's career and pedigree as reason for why he should be seen as credible, Cuomo dismissed his viewpoint as partisan nonsense. He was pretty sharp on his prediction. Here's a breakdown from Fleitz of why Rep. Schiff's and the wistleblower's actions were so damaging.\n\nBelow is this twitter thread and the two relevant tweets:https://t.co/fzwLXchBFD pic.twitter.com/tBVLT0HY3r \u2014 Fred Fleitz (@FredFleitz) October 2, 2019\n\n4/ Supposedly the @HouseIntelComm dem counsel told the CIA whistleblower to hire counsel and go through the ICIG process. That would be believable if Schiff and his staff revealed this weeks ago. @Susan_Hennessey and @MiekeEoyang : don't be fooled by this. \u2014 Fred Fleitz (@FredFleitz) October 2, 2019\n\n6/ And here's the kicker (@Susan_Hennessey &@MiekeEoyang pay attention): under @HouseIntelComm rules, any classified info brought to the committee from outside sources MUST BE SHARED WITH BOTH SIDES. Schiff broke committee rules by not telling committee GOP members about this. \u2014 Fred Fleitz (@FredFleitz) October 2, 2019", "description": ".10/03/2019 19:24:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/226/5f500418-5b28-4bba-b3a4-0b677543e3ca.png"}
