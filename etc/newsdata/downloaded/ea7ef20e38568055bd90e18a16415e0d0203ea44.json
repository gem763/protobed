This became the basis for a segment from Ingraham\u2019s Fox show later in the evening.\n\nWhen Ingraham asked diGenova for his thoughts on whether there\u2019s a connection between Hasson and President Donald Trump, he grumbled about Virginia\u2019s leaders \u201cgetting a pass\u201d because of the decreasing media focus on them. Soon enough, diGenova went all out and declared \u201cWe are in a civil war in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two standards of justice, one for Democrats one for Republicans. The press is all Democrat, all liberal, all progressive, all left \u2013 they hate Republicans, they hate Trump. So the suggestion that there\u2019s ever going to be civil discourse in this country for the foreseeable future in this country is over. It\u2019s not going to be. It\u2019s going to be total war. And as I say to my friends, I do two things \u2013 I vote and I buy guns.\u201d\n\nListen above, via The Laura Ingraham Show.\n\n[H/T Media Matters]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Ken Meyer (@KenMeyer91) on Twitter\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com", "description": "Former prosecutor and Fox News regular Joe diGenova had a moment on Thursday where he said America is in a \"civil war,\" advising people to grab their guns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/digenova-1-3-1200x866.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-22"}
