Their boots did, anyway.", "language": "en", "text": "It was her date, Andy Hight, 53, a sales rep for a software company. Andy said later he thought Lucia was very attractive. Lucia said their initial interaction felt tense and awkward \u2014 but it helped that they were wearing nearly the same color and style of ankle boots. Their similar fashion sense gave them both a chuckle and eased the tension.\n\nThey relaxed a little more courtesy of some drinks: ros\u00e9 for Lucia and chardonnay for Andy. Once they were seated, they put in an order for small plates: Moroccan spiced ribs, roasted cauliflower, flatbread, beet salad and more. \u201cI like small plates,\u201d Andy said later, \u201cand I\u2019m nervous about people who don\u2019t like to share.\u201d That was not a problem for Lucia. She mentioned that she\u2019s from a large family with six kids, which prompted Andy to reveal that he comes from a family of five children. Andy\u2019s table manners also earned him bonus points: \u201cHe was a gentleman, serving me first and then serving himself,\u201d Lucia recalled.\n\nAndy told Lucia that he had recently relocated to D.C. after four years in Australia, 20-plus years in San Francisco, and many years of traveling for work. Lucia, who was born in Peru, also loves to travel. Andy was enthralled by Lucia\u2019s stories of her recent trip to Spain. She was fascinated by his stories about the safari he just took in South Africa. Then there was Paris: Andy\u2019s favorite city was also high on Lucia\u2019s list of places to visit.\n\nLucia ordered another ros\u00e9, Andy switched to red wine, and the connections continued. They both enjoy hiking. Andy works out regularly at the gym with a trainer and said it was important to him that the women he dates are fit. He was glad to hear that Lucia runs.\n\n\u201cWhat do you like to read?\u201d he asked. Andy likes novels, while Lucia seeks out books by female authors, particularly historical novels, in Spanish. Lucia told me, \u201cHe was sympathetic that I prefer to read in Spanish.\u201d Andy told her that he\u2019d be surprised if she were reading in English. \u201cYou can absorb the story better in your native tongue,\u201d he added.\n\nAround that point, Lucia began to wonder if he could understand her English. \u201cHe seemed to be having a difficult time and putting in a lot of effort to understand my accent,\u201d she told me. When I asked Andy about this, he said, on the contrary, \u201cI could understand her well. I work a lot internationally, and I have a good ear for accents.\u201d\n\nFor his part, he wondered why the date didn\u2019t seem very flirtatious despite the fact that they were very comfortable with each other. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m terrible at is knowing if someone is attracted to me or not,\u201d he said later.\n\nLucia said, \u201cI probably wasn\u2019t that flirtatious with him, but I enjoyed his company very much.\u201d\n\nAt some point, they noticed most of the tables in the restaurant were empty. Lucia said she suggested they go to the bar, but he didn\u2019t respond. Andy explained later he didn\u2019t bypass her invitation because of lack of interest. \u201cI knew she was driving home and figured that ... having more alcohol would not be the right call.\u201d\n\nThey went outside and Andy walked her to her car. Lucia then offered him a ride home. She was headed to her sister\u2019s place, close to where Andy lives. He declined, which was fine with Lucia. She later said: \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural thing. You offer someone a ride, but it probably would have been too much.\u201d Andy, however, did ask for her phone number and promised to contact her the next day. Then they went their separate ways.\n\nLucia found Andy to be more reserved than men she usually dates, but that only stoked her interest: \u201cI get the impression that he\u2019s more fun than what he showed.\u201d Andy, who has hired a matchmaker and used dating apps since returning to the States, told me it was \u201cone of the better dates I\u2019ve had in the last couple of months.\u201d For these two, it wasn\u2019t about instant chemistry and butterflies. Good conversation and meaningful commonalities were enough to keep the curiosity going. The next morning, Andy texted: \u201cHello beautiful Lucia \u2014 I had a good time with you last night, why don\u2019t we get together Monday?\u201d\n\nRate the date\n\nAndy: 4.5 [out of 5].\n\nLucia: 4.25.\n\nUpdate\n\nThey went on a second date but have had no contact since then.\n\nDamona Hoffman is a certified dating coach and the host of the \u201cDates & Mates\u201d podcast.\n\nMore from Date Lab:\n\nBefore the date, she did a little online sleuthing\n\nHis dream date is with \u2018a Southern belle wedding planner that knows her way around the kitchen\u2019\n\nDate Lab 2.0: Four new writers dig deeper to find out how the dates really went\n\nApply now to Date Lab", "description": "\u201cOne thing I\u2019m terrible at is knowing if someone is attracted to me or not,\u201d he says.", "authors": ["Damona Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NC4TSLWIGYI6TJHTYCA2CJW6OA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
