Several analysts said the sudden reversal reflects Trump\u2019s concerns about holding Republican support as impeachment heats up. Former Barack Obama and George W. Bush administration officials said the Trump Doral resort should not even have been under consideration because of the perception of conflicts of interest. The G-7 is a high-profile, annual gathering of leaders from the world's largest industrialized economies.\n\nFlorida GOP lawmaker who's undecided on impeaching Trump decides not to seek re-election.\n\ndecides not to seek re-election.

Instead, opposition and rebel lawmakers passed a last-minute motion Saturday to postpone an important Brexit vote, legally forcing Johnson to request a delay of the U.K.\u2019s exit. A reluctant Johnson sent a letter requesting the delay late Saturday night, but he also made clear that he opposed Britain's departure, scheduled for Oct. 31. The outcome, and Johnson's response, injects new confusion and uncertainty into the Brexit process and piles pressure on Britain's leader just three months into his tenure. His government argued that any delay increases the likelihood of a \"no deal\" Brexit, which experts warn could harm Britain\u2019s economy and lead to border chaos. Britain\u2019s Parliament may vote on his deal as early as Monday.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrives for a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels, on Oct. 17, 2019.

The 5-foot-6 second baseman's two-out, ninth-inning homer propelled the team past the New York Yankees, 6-4. The Astros will take on the National League champion Washington Nationals in the World Series, beginning Tuesday in Houston. After losing winner-take-all playoff games in 2012, 2016 and 2017, the Nats put their past postseason failures behind them and advanced to the Series by sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals last week. Altuve's walkoff homer knocked out the Yankees, who have gone a decade without a World Series trip for first time in 100 years.\n\nReal quick\n\nUS troops leaving Syria to go to western Iraq, defense chief says\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper says that under current plans all U.S. troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq and the military will continue to conduct operations against the Islamic State group to prevent its resurgence. Esper\u2019s comments were the first to specifically lay out where American troops will go as they leave Syria and what the counter-IS fight could look like. Speaking to reporters traveling with him to the Middle East, Esper did not rule out the idea that U.S. forces would conduct counterterrorism missions from Iraq into Syria. But he said those details will be worked out over time. Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to defend his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, opening the door to a Turkish assault on Kurds who had helped America combat the Islamic State, but in the process, he incorrectly identified his secretary of defense.", "description": "The Astros are heading to the World Series.
