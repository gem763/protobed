Biden faces scrutiny, too.\n\nMr. Trump said he informed House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and the GOP conference that he\u2019s all for transparency, as Democrats attempt to pry loose the complaint from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nMr. Maguire is set to testify on Capitol Hill Thursday.\n\n\u201cI fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly second-hand information,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a U.N. press conference.\n\nBut, Mr. Trump added, he will demand \u201ctransparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said he wants information on the \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d that have been \u201cquickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, I demand transparency from Democrats that went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Mr. Trump is demanding, precisely, as he hasn\u2019t offered evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden beyond the appearance of a conflict.\n\nMr. Biden demanded the ouster of a prosecutor who once looked into the leader of gas company Burisma Holdings.\n\nHunter Biden served on the company\u2019s board, though wasn\u2019t accused of wrongdoing. A probe into the company was reportedly dormant when Mr. Biden and other Western leaders demanded the ouster of General Prosecutor Viktor Shokin in 2016, saying he wasn\u2019t taking on corruption.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
