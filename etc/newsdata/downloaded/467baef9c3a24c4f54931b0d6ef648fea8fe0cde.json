But to take his cocktails to a new and funky level, he had to find a way to work with ingredients that were just too finicky for traditional methods.\n\nThat\u2019s when he and a colleague started considering using a sous vide system to quickly extract flavors from unusual ingredients.\n\nTraditionally, chefs use the technique to cook everything from vegetables to steak to tender perfection\u2014the food (or, in this case, liquor) is sealed in an airtight container and submerged in a warm bath.\n\n\u201cI realized that I could let pecans sit in vodka for three weeks or I could spend one hour doing it,\u201d says Walter. \u201cThe sous vide is amazing\u2014it\u2019s probably the most intense tool I\u2019ve used.\u201d\n\nWalter adds that there are two big reasons this has become his go-to infusion method. For one, you don\u2019t lose any alcohol during the process and secondly, he\u2019s able to extract a more intense, concentrated flavor from an ingredient.\n\n\u201cIt has been really useful to me and it\u2019s funny how it\u2019s made some things possible,\u201d says Walter. \u201cIt encourages me to make more complex things. It gives you a lot more access to getting to the place you want to be. It\u2019s more time to make mistakes and figure out your mistakes quicker, too.\u201d\n\nWalter actually built his own sous vide system in what he calls \u201cpoor Southern fashion.\u201d That is, he uses Ziplock freezer bags, a good thermometer and \u201ca real big gumbo pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt works as well as a fancy [machine],\u201d says Walter. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind having the fancy stuff, but it\u2019s kind of fun to pretend those things weren\u2019t invented.\u201d\n\nAnd so far, the method has worked wonders. He\u2019s found success with fresh herbs that, in a more traditional infusion might be \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but in a sous vide yield nice, clean savory notes. One particularly exciting result Walter had is with fresh mushrooms, which he uses in a shiitake and honey liqueur made with a vodka base.\n\nSous vide has also allowed Walter to infuse a spirit with multiple ingredients at once. \u201cIf you can get up to four ingredients at a time to infuse straight into a liquor, you can almost pass a lot of cocktail making that way,\u201d says Walter. \u201cIt\u2019s like a one-pot meal.\u201d\n\nThis is how he made the Bobby Charles cocktail, which was on a recent Loa menu. The base of the cocktail was a house-made, sous vide-infused blueberry aquavit that also was flavored with caraway, anise and fennel. The concoction was then mixed with elements of lemongrass, celery and dill.\n\n\u201cThat drink was just a smashing success,\u201d says Walter. \u201cIt had savory notes. The blueberry and caraway play off each other great and the sous vide allowed the blueberries to give up their fruit. It was a bright, gorgeous rosy blue color. After a few times doing it, I knew my measurements well enough to do the caraway, anise, fennel and blueberries all in the same bag.\u201d\n\nFor his new fall menu, Walter, of course, included a couple sous vide infusion drinks. The Greater New Orleans French 75 features a Cognac infused with peaches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple idea, but is really delicious,\u201d says Walter.\n\nThe Greater New Orleans French 75\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n1.5 oz Peach-infused Cognac Park VS\n\n.75 oz Fresh lemon juice\n\n.5 oz Peach syrup\n\n1 Dash Angostura Bitters\n\n3 oz Sparkling ros\u00e9\n\nGlass: Champagne flute\n\nGarnish: Lemon twist\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\nFor the Cognac-Infused with Peach: Slice the peaches thinly and dehydrate. Add the peaches to the Cognac and submerge in a sous vide bath at 155 degrees Fahrenheit for two-and-a-half hours.\n\nFor the Peach Syrup: Slice the peaches in half and press flat. Allow the peaches to simmer in a simple syrup (one part sugar, one part water) for 30 minutes.\n\nAdd all the ingredients, except the sparkling wine, to a cocktail shaker and fill with ice. Shake and strain into a Champagne glass. Top with the sparkling ros\u00e9 and garnish with a lemon twist.", "description": "The creative director of New Orleans bar Loa has found a way to use unusual ingredients, like mushrooms and herbs, in cocktails.", "authors": ["Anna Archibald"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571194949/191015-Rothbaum-Adam-Walter-tease_jyfvfg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
