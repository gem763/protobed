It was an entirely average outfit for a momentous occasion. The only flair present was a tiny zipper up the front, which left a few online commentators wondering if Pelosi had her midi on backward. (She did not.)\n\nIt was not a new look, either. Pelosi wore the frock before, back in January, underneath her winter coat\u2014no, not that Max Mara coat, which went viral after she wore it while leaving a meeting with Trump and Senator Chuck Schumer last year.\n\nDespite public excitement on the left regarding the possibility of impeaching Trump\u2014cheeky recipes for peach cocktails made rounds on the internet this week\u2014Pelosi said on Friday that the investigation \u201cis no cause for joy. This is a sad time for our country.\u201d But she spoke those words on Morning Joe while wearing a baby pink pantsuit, hardly the uniform of a nation in mourning.\n\nDemocrats announced their inquiry on Tuesday, and it could take weeks or longer before proceedings begin. Of course not every outfit Democrats wear until then should be scrutinized too closely. But the past few days have been historic, if exhausting, for Americans, and lawmakers are dressing accordingly, with the gravitas this situation carries.\n\nSometimes, that means ballet-slipper\u2014dare I say millennial\u2014pink, a color which in recent years has come to embody gender-fluidity and cultural shifts. Popular feminists have reclaimed the hue to challenge the notion that girly thing are inherently unserious. Pelosi\u2019s suit shows that a woman can lead one of government\u2019s weightiest responsibilities in soft pastels, thank you very much.\n\nAfter acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified at a hearing regarding the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, Pelosi held another presser in a pristine white frock with a scoop neck and cuffed sleeves. An undergraduate reading of the look might call it angelic, casting Good Pelosi against Bad Trump. But the Speaker added a crafty, almost homespun element that distracted from her clean posturing\u2014a chunky red and blue necklace.\n\nPelosi could have been any woman at a Potomac Starbucks ordering her obligatory one Pumpkin Spice Latte of the season, but she was accusing one of the most powerful people in the world of orchestrating a \u201ccover-up.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) looked the part, too, on Wednesday. The morning after the inquiry was launched, the freshman lawmaker showed up ready to work in a beige sweater and carnelian jewelry, toting an extra-large coffee cup. She meant business, even if one can practically hear the clanging of her bulky necklace just from staring at her picture.\n\nHouse Appropriation Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) both injected some flair into the standard D.C. ensemble of red, white, and blue. Jackson Lee wore pearls for the occasion; so did Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA).\n\nFor most of this week, certain (very stylish) sources have been debating the \u201cdream\u201d impeachment outfit. The preferred aesthetic basically resembles a very expensive Elle Woods Halloween costume: pink Chanel tweed skirt, black circle sunglasses, Louboutins, and a very tiny purse. \u201cI will have to take a personal day if Pelosi shows up in that outfit,\u201d I kindly informed them. (Your move, Speaker.)\n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t live in a world where Patricia Field costume designs for politicians. And, really, Pelosi and company would do well to dress reticently, lest Trump's Twitterati come after them for appearing too gilded. As Vanity Fair staff writer Kenzie Bryant wrote, \u201cIt [is] not a time to gloat\u2014verbally nor sartorially.\u201d\n\nYes, Pelosi seems to be outfitting herself very carefully, unsurprising for a speaker who waited approximately an entire ice age to support impeachment.\n\nBut her tepid wardrobe\u2014no tiny purses allowed\u2014also shows that during a chaotic and dramatic week, maybe the most ordinary thing she and other Democrats did was peek into their closets and suit up for the day.\n\nEven in, as Pelosi put it, a \u201csad time,\u201d everyone still has to get dressed. A pink pantsuit never fails to perk things up.", "description": "Pink pantsuit, chunky necklaces, and the obligatory flag pin: here\u2019s how Democratic lawmakers are suiting up for a long and dramatic process.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569611519/190927-pelosi-impeachment-fashion-tease_qngiys", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
