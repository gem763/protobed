That opposition intensified this week when Liberal senator Dean Smith proposed increasing the base or rate of the GST and abolishing payroll tax in return.\n\nMr Perrottet argues in his article that he was not, as some critics contended, proposing an increase in taxes but a more efficient tax mix.\n\nSimply increasing taxes is not tax reform. \u2014 Dominic Perrottet, NSW Treasurer\n\n\"As a small government Liberal, I have no interest in providing the government with more of other people\u2019s money. Simply increasing taxes is not tax reform,'' he says.\n\n\"The question is not so much the amount of tax but the type and mix of taxes our revenue is raised from.\"\n\nMr Perrottet says the while economy may have grown for 28 years, it was approaching a stasis similar to one it reached in the 1970s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The grand reforms of the Hawke-Keating and then the Howard-Costello eras, which saw tariffs fall, the dollar floated and the introduction of the GST, halted the slide,'' he says.\n\n\"The only choice we face is whether we embrace reform and shape it, or ignore it until we are dragged kicking and screaming into the future we know is coming.\"\n\nHe opines that the economic challenges are many but that the modern media cycle makes the task of reform more difficult.\n\n\"The list of challenges confronting policymakers \u2013 drought, balanced budgets, interest rates, trade wars, unemployment, infrastructure funding, taxes, even inverted bond yield curves \u2013 is long,'' he says.\n\n\"Add in intense media scrutiny which seeks to distil everything to a digestible sound-bite or create confrontation, and a political system which has seldom seemed more fragile, and there is little wonder policy reform is not at the top of any to-do list.\n\n\"But there is a strong case it should be.\"", "description": "The NSW Treasurer says national prosperity is at stake and the Morrison government needs to display the courage of its forebears.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_19/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/178a95c66e0a82665053ee49574788c297c0ecb2", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
