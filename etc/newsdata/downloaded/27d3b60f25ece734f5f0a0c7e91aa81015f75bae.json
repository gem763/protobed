It stands for quantum dot light-emitting diode and, holy crap, it\u2019s way better than LCD (liquid crystal display). Like we\u2019re talking no contest in the picture quality department.\n\nI tested a Samsung 65\u201d QLED 4K Q90 smart television for a month and frankly I\u2019m hooked; I\u2019ll just sit here and keep watching movies and playing Xbox games all day thank you.\n\nUsing the FandangoNow 4K app that runs on the smart television, I watched John Wick Chapter 3 - Parabellum and could see the perspiration on Keanu Reeves face as he blasted everyone in sight. In Spider-Man: Far From Home, you can see and hear the webs shooting from the fingers of Tom Holland. (The Samsung 65\u201d QLED 4K Q90 has lush built-in audio that rivals some soundbars I\u2019ve tested in the past.) The Xbox game Gears 5 looked so photo-realistic the gory bits seemed to explode off the screen.\n\nSo back to those quantum dots. With any television, you are paying for the latest technology. There\u2019s just way more detail with QLED, and the 4K processor in the Samsung 65\u201d QLED 4K Q90 can upscale HD content. It\u2019s also super fast. During one John Wick horse chase scene, the camera pans were quick and smooth, not clunky. Lesser televisions sometimes can\u2019t keep up with the 4K video streams and they...pause...for...effect.\n\nFor $2,597, this smart television is packed with extras. I tested built-in Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Vudu, Hulu, and anything else I could find. I even liked the ambient video mode, which plays background video and music to help you fall asleep or check email. Glare was minimal in my office even with a large window in the background. A Minnesota Vikings game last Sunday looked spectacular in HD running on a Dish Hopper 3. Even from a side viewing angle this television will captivate anyone in the room. I\u2019m serious.\n\nIn review: QLED. It\u2019s fast, smoother \u2014 and you can see Keanu Reeves\u2019 sweat. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
