REUTERS/Jose Luis Saavedra/File Photo\n\nThousands of people poured into Santiago\u2019s central squares on Monday to protest high living costs and inequality.\n\nAs pressure mounted, Chile\u2019s center-right President Sebastian Pinera said he would meet with opposition leaders on Tuesday to forge a \u201cnew social contract.\u201d\n\nTen cities throughout Chile have been placed in a state of emergency and under evening lockdown since riots broke out last Friday.\n\nThe general in charge of security in Santiago, Javier Iturriaga early on Monday told Chileans that the city \u201chad slept tranquilly last night.\u201d Iturriaga reported only minor, isolated incidents following a military lockdown that began at 8 p.m.\n\nThe widespread protests have nonetheless continued to sow destruction across the city. Santiago\u2019s central Plaza Italia, the focal point of much of the unrest, was littered with broken glass and stone, graffiti and still-smoldering fires. Many downtown streets reeked of tear gas early on Monday.\n\n\u2018NOTHING CHANGES\u2019\n\nRoxana Yanez, 56, a factory worker, said she had had a difficult commute.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, we support these protests. We don\u2019t earn much, just enough to pay our bus fare,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t support is disorder, riots, looting. That doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nThe recent protests in Chile were sparked by an increase in public transport fares in early October. But they reflect simmering anger over intense economic inequality in Chile, as well as costly health, education and pension systems seen by many as inadequate.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t stop until people see real change,\u201d said Brandon Rodriguez, 25, a security guard. \u201cGovernments of the left and right have come and gone...but nothing changes for ordinary people.\u201d\n\nLate into the day on Monday, demonstrators spread along main avenues, plazas and bridges around the city, and remained on the streets until past the 8 p.m. curfew before soldiers dispersed them using water cannons, tear gas and verbal persuasion.\n\nGeneral Iturriaga said he was aware of videos circulating on social media suggesting brutality by police or the military in dealing with protesters and vandals.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating every one of these situations. We\u2019re not going to hide anything,\u201d Iturriaga told reporters.\n\nInterior sub-secretary Rodrigo Ubilla declined to identify the 15 people killed thus far in the riots.\n\nThe unrest in Chile has yet to dock copper output from the world\u2019s top producer of the red metal, mining officials said.\n\nWorkers at BHP\u2019s Escondida copper mine, the world\u2019s largest, nonetheless initiated a 5-hour strike Tuesday morning, union officials told Reuters.\n\nAt Santiago\u2019s international airport, many passengers were stranded after hundreds of flights were canceled by major airlines over several days and airlines laid out camp beds on the airport forecourt to accommodate them.", "description": "A hobbled metro system and damage to downtown streets snarled public transportation in the Chilean capital Santiago on Tuesday, following days of protests throughout the country that have left 15 dead and led to the arrest of 2,600, officials said.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443747960&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L15K", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
