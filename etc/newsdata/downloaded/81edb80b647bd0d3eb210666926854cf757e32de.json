Storyful\n\nNEW ORLEANS - In the wake of the partial collapse of the Hard Rock Hotel construction site on Oct 12, 11 lawsuits have been filed by site workers, nearby businesses, bystanders and the children of two of the men killed.\n\nAll but one of the lawsuits, filed in Orleans Parish Civil District Court, make unspecific allegations of negligence against the owners of the project, the general contractor Citadel Builders and numerous sub-contractors. Those suits read like placeholders for facts that will be established later as the litigation moves forward.\n\nThe under-construction, 18-story hotel on the edge of the French Quarter collapsed just after 9 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 12, sending debris spilling into the street below. Three workers were killed and dozens were injured.\n\nOne lawsuit, filed by attorney Rene Rocha of the law firm Morgan & Morgan, does make a number of specific allegations, including that structural supports were not strong enough to support the concrete in the upper floors, the use of unskilled labor, and not allowing time for concrete to cure fully.\n\nThe suit also claims the contractors supplied incorrect test results to the city.\n\n'Very dangerous situation': Two dead, one still missing after Hard Rock hotel collapse\n\nThis aerial photo shows the Hard Rock Hotel, which was under construction, after a fatal partial collapse in New Orleans, Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019.

The detailed allegations of wrongdoing came from these workers and engineers interviewed by Rocha's firm.\n\nThe children of Anthony Magrette and Quinnyon Wimberly, two of the men killed in the collapse, along with their relatives filed separate lawsuits. Those suits seek compensation for the suffering of the deceased and the loss of companionship. The bodies of Wimberly and Jose Ponce Arreola, the third victim killed, remain trapped in the rubble.\n\nCitadel and Harry Baker Smith, the architect for the hotel, declined to comment on any of the lawsuits. Kailas Company, the owner of the property, and Heaslip Engineering, the structural engineers, did not respond to calls seeking comment.\n\nEngineer weighs in on Hard Rock Hotel collapse: 'Logically, it doesn't make sense'\n\nTwo large cranes from the Hard Rock Hotel construction collapse come crashing down after being detonated for implosion in New Orleans, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2019.

Two massive, damaged cranes on the site were partially taken down with explosives Sunday. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has said that she wants the entire structure demolished.\n\nThe cause of the collapse is under investigation by the New Orleans Police Department and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nCitadel has faced a previous accusation of negligence on the Hard Rock hotel project. In 2018, the contractor was sued by Todd Trosclair, one of the partners in the Hard Rock hotel. Trosclair Equity III, a company that public records show is owned by Trosclair, sued Citadel for damaging a wall shared with a building it owns on Iberville Street. That lawsuit was dismissed in September at Trosclair's request.\n\nTrosclair's company All-Star Electric, the electrical contractor for the Hard Rock project, is itself now a defendant in many of the lawsuits filed after the collapse.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/30/new-orleans-hard-rock-hotel-collapse-site-lawsuits-civil-court/4095561002/", "description": "Workers, businesses, bystanders and children of two men killed asre suing the project owner and construction contractors involved in Oct. 12 collapse.", "authors": ["Todd A.
