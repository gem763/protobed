Iran has refused to offer the same for Adelkhah, citing her Iranian nationality, and has called France\u2019s demands for her release an interference in its internal affairs.\n\nAdelkhah and Marchal were arrested at a time when France and other European powers were caught up in an international standoff over Tehran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal, which the United States abandoned last year.\n\nMarchal, an Africa expert, had sought to spend the Eid religious holiday with his colleague in Iran, but was arrested at Tehran airport upon his arrival, their university association said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNothing justifies the arrest of Fariba Adelkhah and Roland Marchal,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTheir activities are strictly academic and have no links whatsoever to any intelligence service and (they) do not carry out any political activity in Iran.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 9 France issued a new advisory for Iran warning its nationals to postpone all travel plans, underscoring the risk posed by \u201cthe arbitrary arrest and detention practices of the Iranian security and intelligence services especially with regard to the contacts of foreign nationals with the population, notably for those in universities\u201d.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron sought in September to broker a meeting between Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and U.S. President Donald Trump as he sought to defuse tensions between the two in recent months and convince Iran to comply with the nuclear deal. Those efforts faltered.\n\nIn another incident, Iran said on Monday agents of Revolutionary Guards had captured and returned to Iran a Paris-based journalist they suspect of fuelling anti-government street unrest across Iran last year using social media.\n\nSpokeswoman von der Muhll on Wednesday also confirmed Rouhollah Zam had been given political asylum in France, but had no details on the circumstances surrounding his arrest outside of France.\n\n\u201cWe recall our commitment to the respect for the rule of law, including freedom of expression and the right of asylum, and strongly condemn the arrest of Mr Zam,\u201d she said.", "description": "France demanded on Wednesday that Iran immediately release two of its nationals who have been held in prison since June, a situation that is likely to complicate Paris's efforts to defuse tensions between the United States and Tehran.", "authors": ["John Irish", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
