These behaviours have no place within the BMA.\n\n\u201cI am deeply sorry to those who have been affected and I thank all those individuals who came forward to contribute to the review \u2013 I recognise their strength and courage in speaking out.\u201d\n\nDr Helena McKeown, a chief officer at the BMA and representative body chair, said: \u201cI am of an age where sexism has pervaded so many parts of my personal and working life for too long. It\u2019s not just within the BMA, but that doesn\u2019t mean we accept it; we don\u2019t, and we won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBMA chief executive, Tom Grinyer, said he would introduce an external guardian of safe working and internal staff listening champions for all involved in the BMA.\n\n\u201cI arrived in July determined to tackle these cultural issues and this report gives us clear recommendations to do that,\u201d he added.\n\nIn line with Ms Romney\u2019s recommendations, the BMA has launched an independent and external 24-hour support line, and an independent complaints investigation process carried out by an external firm.\n\nDr Bramall-Stainer and Dr Norris both previously said \u201cvery senior\u201d male members of the BMA\u2019s GP committee had called them \u201cnaughty girls\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Women face sexual harassment and bullying at the\u00a0British Medical Association, a scathing\u00a0report has found.
