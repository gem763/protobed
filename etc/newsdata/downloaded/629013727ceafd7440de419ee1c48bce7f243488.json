More than 110,000 personnel are involved in search and rescue operations, including 13,000 police, 66,000 fire department staff and 31,000 self-defense force staff, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said in a press conference Monday.\n\nOne of those killed was a 77-year-old woman who fell 40 meters (131 feet) during a helicopter rescue operation in Iwaki City, Fukushima prefecture, on Sunday morning, Tokyo Fire Department press officer Yuji Kikuchi said.\n\nRescuers had failed to properly attach a hook to the harness as the woman was being pulled onto the helicopter. \"We apologize from the bottom of our heart,\" Hirofumi Shimizu, the deputy chief of Tokyo Fire Department, said in a press conference on Sunday. \"We will try our best not to have this happen again and to recover trust to us.\"\n\nMore than 230,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, and emergency orders were issued for many cities around the greater Tokyo area. As of Monday, more than 84,000 households in Tokyo, northern Japan and mountainous areas in the center of the country were still without power, according to electricity companies.\n\nA man sorts through the debris of a building that was destroyed by a tornado shortly before the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis, on October 13, 2019 in Chiba, Japan.\n\nTyphoon-hit regions are bracing for more rain on Monday which could exacerbate flooding, prompting authorities to caution people to stay away from rivers and mountain slopes.\n\nVideo released by authorities and shared online showed the extent of the devastation in Japan.\n\nOne clip shows a helicopter hovering over a house surrounded by murky water as rescuers pull a person to safety in Fukushima prefecture.

Another four were found by government officials.\n\nOn Monday, Fukushima prefecture decontamination spokesperson Akira Suzuki could not say whether more bags had washed away over the weekend.\n\n\"We are confirming how many are gone as well as searching for any other bags washed away,\" Suzuki said.\n\nShoji Watanabe, the head of nuclear disaster measurement office, said the radiation levels of the material in the bags had decreased over time. However, he refused to say that the bags were entirely safe.\n\nHe estimated that the radiation level from the material contained in each bag was between 0.3 to 1 microsievert per hour -- over the government standard of 0.23 microsievert per hour\n\nPhotos: In photos: Typhoon Hagibis hits Japan Residential areas are submerged in muddy waters after an embankment of the Chikuma River broke in Nagano, Japan, on October 13.
