His moves have been met with increasing hostility, raising the prospect of isolation and blockade.\n\nSome Iraqi leaders have warned of military action, particularly over the fate of Kirkuk, and the national parliament approved the use of force as part of a 13-point resolution condemning the referendum.\n\nFearful neighbours look on as Iraq\u2019s Kurds stake claim to nationhood Read more\n\nPeshmerga fighters took control of the Kirkuk oilfields in 2014, when the Iraqi army fled in the wake of Islamic State\u2019s advance on the city. Kirkuk is home to Kurds, Turkmens and Arabs. The latter appeared to boycott the ballot, while Kurds turned out in large numbers.\n\nIran has threatened to use Iraqi militias, with whom it has strong influence, to wrest back control of the city, which is essential to Kurdistan\u2019s fragile economy. As revenue sharing and oil deals have collapsed over the past four years, the Kurdish north has completed construction of a pipeline to Turkey, which has helped the Kurds export oil using its Mediterranean port.\n\n\n\nTrade between Erbil and Ankara is thought to be close to \u00a37.5bn a year, meaning Turkey would face a significant financial blow if it chose to close its borders. Officials in Erbil believe the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, will pull back from his threats, but are less sure about the next moves in their standoff with Baghdad and Tehran.\n\n\n\nNationalistic fervour has been widespread in Erbil since Monday\u2019s referendum, which large numbers of Kurds have hailed as a landmark moment in a centuries-old push for self-determination. Barzani has insisted the poll does not trigger immediate moves towards sovereignty. Rather, he says, it lays the groundwork for further discussions with Baghdad.\n\nIn the absence of a mechanism to advance independence, critics of the referendum say it is little more than an opinion poll, which could only be leveraged into statehood through broad international involvement.\n\n\n\nWith the exception of Russia and Israel, all regional states and most international allies and foes opposed the referendum, fearing it would destabilise an already volatile area.\n\n\n\nThe US and Britain, which strongly opposed the referendum and have since described it as \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d, have softened their rhetoric and have tried to broker a deal between Erbil and Baghdad. Washington has challenged the air blockade, which has led to many international carriers suspending flights to Erbil.\n\n\n\nThe Kurds are the region\u2019s fourth largest ethnic group and have never obtained a nation state. The carve-up of the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman empire left substantial Kurdish populations in what is now Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran, as well as a large diaspora abroad. Moves towards sovereignty have long been opposed by all four states, who fear knock-on effects within their Kurdish communities and potential threats to their borders.\n\n", "description": "Referendum results in overwhelming endorsement of split from Baghdad, after troops are sent into disputed areas", "authors": ["Martin Chulov", "Amjed Rasheed", "Simon Tisdall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8fcc2adfaa83a41f41e48d88e9ed35d5f718973/0_99_6508_3905/master/6508.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d0187d2cd7306a77200ede8a87d05fe7", "published_at": "2017-09-27"}
