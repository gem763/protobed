It's already been in my head, thinking about him as a future captain,\" the United boss said previously.\n\n\"On the pitch he's a leader. He stands on the ball when we need to slow it down, he defends well, he's got this presence in both boxes and off the pitch he is a top professional.\n\n(Image: BT Sport)\n\n\"He's vocal - he voices his opinion at training and in the dressing room - and I'm very pleased with the money we've spent on him.\n\n\"He hasn't asked [to be captain] yet! But it's been in my head that he can wear the armband.\"", "description": "The referee and his assistants had to call the Manchester United captain over to join them at the centre circle", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Bt Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717407.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-180202.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
