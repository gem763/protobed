Not only was it a breakout star, the industry rose from an August shrinkage to add 16,000 jobs.\n\nIt might have been the end of summer but retailers' holiday preparations are underway, and the season's onslaught, coupled with e-commerce's continued growth, is behind the growth, economist said.\n\n\"Transportation and warehousing also added 15,700 jobs,\" Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor, said. \"as the holiday hiring season kicks off, and employers prepare for the anticipated growth in demand for transportation from the explosion of e-commerce. By contrast, retail shed 11,400 jobs as retailers follow the shift in consumer demand online.\"\n\nTransit and ground-passenger transportation also contributed to transportation's September boon. Like many skilled labor jobs, cities and school districts simply can't find enough bus drivers, especially in the face of rising costs of living.\n\n\"Transit agencies across the country are fighting a losing battle to keep bus operations at current capacity as it gets harder to fill operator positions,\" the Eno Center for Transportation wrote last month.

Data from the American Public Transportation Association shows that 2.5 billion Americans used public transportation in the second quarter of 2019, an 11 million jump over the same period of 2018, The Washington Post reported.\n\nBut not all transportation is created equal.\n\nTrucking also saw a yet another \"bloodbath\" in the latest tally, sinking by 4,200 jobs, according to the BLS report. That slump continues the industry's recession, into which it slipped during the first half of 2019, according to ACT Research.\n\nRead more: Another 4,200 truck drivers lost their jobs in September as a recession slams America's $800 billion trucking industry\n\nThat's likely been fueled by some weakness in manufacturing, Josh Wright, chief economist of the software company iCIMS, said.\n\n\"This economy is not just still on its feet, but still moving forward,\" he wrote, but \"with manufacturing weak and the labor market only modestly in positive territory, much depends on consumer spending and the Fed's reaction function.\"", "description": "Driver shortages paired with holiday shopping prep fueled a surprise September employment situation star.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b87bd591bb738bb6b25af?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
