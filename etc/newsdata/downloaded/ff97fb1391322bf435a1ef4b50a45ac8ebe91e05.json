Her reward shouldn\u2019t be a death sentence.", "language": "en", "text": "Now, Bueso faces a new threat to her health: irrational changes in U.S. immigration policy.\n\nBueso is 24 now. When she was 7, I invited her to the United States for the clinical trial of a groundbreaking treatment. Her participation helped win that treatment Food and Drug Administration approval, and she continues to be a part of follow-up studies that help doctors and scientists better treat people with her condition, also known as MPS-6. That treatment has involved Bueso receiving a six-hour infusion at UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland every week for the past 16 years \u2014 a treatment she continues to receive here weekly.\n\nYou would think a grateful country might reward Bueso for the role she has played in advancing this medical treatment by allowing her to stay in the United States and continuing to receive the treatment she helped prove effective. Instead, on Aug. 7, she received a letter from the Department of Homeland Security informing her that she had 33 days to leave the United States or face deportation. While the Trump administration has backed off from that deadline for Bueso and other patients like her, their petitions to stay remain under review. That\u2019s a mistake that could cost patients such as Isabel Bueso their lives and the rest of us the advances we gain from their willingness to help.\n\nResearchers often can\u2019t find enough American rare-disease patients to conduct sufficiently large clinical trials. So they look abroad for patients like Bueso. Each year, U.S. scientists invite hundreds of sick foreigners to participate in this research. To continue their treatments, the patients\u2019 families apply for participation in a program called \u201cmedical deferred action\u201d that allows patients and their families to stay in the United States for renewable two-year periods while undergoing lifesaving medical care. Roughly 1,000 migrants apply for medical deferred action each year. This is a small number relative to the overall levels of immigration, but without these immigrants, researchers couldn\u2019t develop cutting-edge treatments and cures that benefit generations of Americans.\n\nMPS-6 is such a condition. It had baffled Bueso\u2019s Guatemalan doctors for good reason: Fewer than 2,000 people worldwide are affected by it. The clinical trial in which I asked her to participate initially did not have enough participants; Isabel\u2019s willingness to be involved, and her family\u2019s willingness to relocate to support her, helped make it possible for the trial to move forward. Two years later, it led to the FDA approval of Naglazyme, a first-of-its-kind enzyme-replacement therapy that extends patients\u2019 lives by more than a decade, on average.\n\nThis therapy has helped keep Bueso alive, and it allowed her to graduate summa cum laude from California State University, East Bay and to make other contributions, including establishing a scholarship for students with disabilities. Her family members, meanwhile, have forged new careers and new connections in their church and community here in the United States.\n\nIt might be slightly less cruel to ask the Buesos to disrupt their lives again if the therapy their daughter helped develop and receives weekly at UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland was available in Guatemala. It is not. If she\u2019s deported, she\u2019ll die within a year.\n\nFortunately, after widespread public backlash, the Trump administration agreed to reevaluate Isabel Bueso\u2019s petition \u2014 and those of others that benefit from the deferred-action program. But there\u2019s no guarantee that Trump administration officials will allow Isabel and other patients to stay. Indeed, administration officials continue to call their efforts to restrict the program \u201cappropriate\u201d \u2014 and they\u2019ve yet to say whether they\u2019ll grant extensions or continue the program.\n\nThis is remarkably shortsighted. More than 30 million Americans suffer from a rare disease. Ninety-five percent of these conditions lack a single approved treatment. American scientists are working hard to find new treatments, but no single country has enough patients to conduct trials on these ultra-rare ailments. If we want the United States to continue leading the world in medical innovation, we will need patients from around the world to participate in our clinical trials.\n\nThere is nothing harder for a pediatrician than explaining to young parents that their precious child is suffering from a rare genetic disease for which there is no cure. All we can provide to them is the hope that in their child\u2019s lifetime, medical advances will be made.\n\nThe sacrifice of patients such as Isabel Bueso help provide those families with hope. These families deserve our heartfelt gratitude, not a deportation notice.\n\nRead more:\n\nMax Boot: Trump is rewriting the meaning of America.
