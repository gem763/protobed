I took it shortly before Mum suffered a severe stroke that left her unable to speak or walk and confined to hospital for three miserable months.\n\nLoved: Janet Appleyard (right) with her daughter Mandy (left). Janet suffered a severe stroke that left her unable to speak or walk and confined her to hospital for three months\n\nIt has changed life for her, and my sister and I, for ever. Last month, we reluctantly moved Mum into a care home, guilt-ridden and broken by the challenge of being her full-time carers, thanks to a social care system that not only dehumanises and mistreats the vulnerable, but stretches their desperate loved ones to unimaginable limits. So it was with little surprise that I read in the Mail last month of the appalling toll of the social care crisis on women, who all too often make up the unseen army of carers.\n\nThese women confessed to not sleeping, eating or caring for themselves properly, thanks to a life where their sick parent, husband or relative was constantly put first. Depression, loneliness and other illnesses were their rewards for such personal neglect.\n\nI suggest guilt should be added to that list, because most women, I\u2019m sure, want to be able to help care for their relatives, to honour parents who have given them so much and to preserve their dignity in old age. Yet they find themselves destroyed by a system that seems only to hinder them in that task.\n\nPermanent care homes are so often the only \u2018solution\u2019, which, for many, leads to a terrible sense of guilt that they\u2019ve abdicated responsibility in their loved ones\u2019 greatest hour of need. As I can testify, the corrosive guilt doesn\u2019t stop there: the trials of being a carer can make you angry, even resentful. You feel as if you\u2019ve surrendered your own life. Indeed, as I have learnt, being a carer eclipses anything else.\n\nJanet Appleyard, aged 81, pictured before her stroke on her favourite Yorkshire beach on a chilly May day this year\n\nToday, I\u2019m left feeling strongly that my mother, Janet, deserved so much more than this. She\u2019s lived a dutiful life: raising me and my younger sister with tenderness, working full-time as a secretary for most of those years; caring for several elderly relatives; running a ship-shape home, even baking bread and cakes every week for those she loved over 60 years.\n\nWhen widowed in 2014, after 58 years of marriage, she adapted well to life without my beloved father.\n\nThen came catastrophe. On May 15, after collapsing at the bus stop on her way to a dancing session, she went from being Janet to a simple statistic; one of the 100,000 people in Britain who suffer a stroke every year, and one of the UK\u2019s 1.2 million stroke survivors, a figure predicted to rise to 2.1 million in 2035.\n\nThe day after her stroke, on the ward at Hull Royal Infirmary, Mum writhed in distress at finding her left side paralysed, her face drooping on one side, unable to speak.\n\nHelplessly, my sister and I realised with horror that life had suddenly changed beyond measure for us all.\n\nAs shock subsided, the shortcomings of the NHS proved to be the next circle of Hell. Those early days were a blur: nobody communicated with us. Mum\u2019s consultant was elusive and condescending; hard-pressed nurses, physios and speech therapists were spread impossibly thinly, and we were surprised to learn that one shower a month was, apparently, routine.\n\nAged 81, Janet still power-washed her drive, cooked a Sunday roast most weekends and even went line-dancing weekly\n\nOn May 15, after collapsing at the bus stop on her way to a dancing session, she went from being Janet (pictured) to a simple statistic\n\nMum, clearly frightened, was in shock at what had happened to her. By miming a gunshot to her head, she communicated that she wanted to die. And, while I understood how she felt about living in such diminished circumstances, I felt panic-stricken that Mum \u2014 previously always undaunted \u2014 now wanted to die.\n\nI asked her to give it time. My sister and I hoped that Mum\u2019s next stop \u2014 a community hospital where she\u2019d go for several weeks of \u2018rehabilitation\u2019 \u2014 would be more positive.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t. In her five weeks there, her burst and displaced catheter left her in agony, yet was apparently ignored.\n\nHow had we gone, in a blink, from a functional family to what felt like frontline soldiers at war with the system? \u2018Why us?\u2019 my sister asked. \u2018Why not us?\u2019 I wondered.\n\nAs the weeks passed, Mum made some improvement. Her speech got a little better and she learned to sit. When the hospital discharged her in August, we hoped her return home would be the tonic she needed.\n\nInstead, she returned to the house she had lived in happily as an active woman to find she couldn\u2019t cook in it, clean it, reach the bathroom or the garden without help, or answer the phone or front door. While she struggled to communicate, she managed to tell me she felt \u2018sad beyond words\u2019 to be so incapacitated in what was her prized domain.\n\nIt was now that our family disappeared down the rabbit hole of State social care, as Mum was placed on a six-week intermediate care package funded by the council.\n\nThis entitled her to an hour\u2019s visit by a carer in the morning, then half-an-hour each at lunchtime, teatime and bedtime: 2.5 hours of care in every 24.\n\nI wonder how many people would be willing to leave their elderly parent home alone day and night but for four brief visits by strangers?\n\nAs a self-employed writer, I had been able to step back from work to visit Mum in hospital every day, with a two-hour drive there and back. My plan, on her discharge from hospital, was simply to \u2018project manage\u2019 the first few days of her homecoming, then get back to work.\n\nWithin 24 hours, though, I realised I would need to step in as a carer. It was immediately apparent that leaving Mum alone in the house for 21.5 hours a day was impossible.\n\nEven for the hours she was technically \u2018cared\u2019 for, those sent to help were often not up to the task.\n\nIt has changed life for her, and my sister and I, for ever. Last month, we reluctantly moved Mum into a care home, guilt-ridden and broken by the challenge of being her full-time carers. Pictured Janet with two children\n\nWhile a couple of the carers couldn\u2019t have been lovelier, despite working long days on minimum wage, others were not. Some turned up late, others claimed to have no experience of using the equipment needed to move Mum. One was psychotically moody, another had a hygiene problem, while several shouted at Mum as if she were deaf or stupid \u2014 she is neither.\n\nWhile Mum put on a polite, brave face, once they were gone she was tearful and unsettled, admitting she didn\u2019t feel safe with them. A proud and private woman, she\u2019d been forced to endure a bizarre parade of people she would never normally tolerate.\n\n\u2018Awful\u2019 was her word for them.\n\nAnd so our lives became a crash course in the challenges faced by relatives who work as carers. I dropped everything, vowing to care for Mum 24/7. It was my duty as her daughter and, more than that, I wanted to \u2014 I love her, after all.\n\nBut, by the end of the first week, I was on my knees. Sleeping in Mum\u2019s spare room, most nights I was up three times: Mum rang a bell if she needed me, if her bedding needed changing, if she was too hot or too cold, or wanted water. Bad dreams woke her; she needed comforting.\n\nNight after night after night.\n\nThen came demanding days: cooking, cleaning and moving Mum between chair, bed, commode and wheelchair. Lifting an immobile body isn\u2019t easy. Then there was the shopping, emptying commodes, medication, changing the bed, phone calls, paperwork for social services, paying bills, updating friends and relatives, reading to Mum, working with her on her speech and physiotherapy, medical appointments.\n\nTen days in, I sent up a flare to my 56-year-old sister who works full-time as a secretary, telling her I wasn\u2019t coping. Having used up all her annual holiday entitlement since Mum\u2019s stroke to be with her in hospital, she managed to arrange a month of unpaid leave and we devised a rota: she covered 9am to 7pm every day, then I did 7pm to 9am. Four weeks later, we were exhausted \u2014 and we\u2019re both single: had we husbands and children at home, an already stressful predicament could have been worse.\n\nI keep wondering how people do this permanently \u2014 and at greater ages than ours. I\u2019m 59, and quickly became bad-tempered and impatient, then unspeakably guilty for feeling this way when none of it was poor Mum\u2019s fault.\n\nAs for me, while I used to be lively, sociable, gregarious \u2014 like Mum \u2014 I looked sad and exhausted. \u2018You look old. You look tired. I\u2019m killing you,\u2019 Mum told me, sobbing, at 4am one day. Each day, each night, brought the same demands.\n\nFor all this relentlessness, the State deems it worth a paltry Carer\u2019s Allowance of \u00a366.15 a week, to which you are entitled only if you earn less than \u00a3123 a week. By contrast, the cost of a private-agency live-in carer is upwards of \u00a31,500 per week.\n\nTwo weeks in, desperate for a night\u2019s sleep at home, I rang an agency to ask what it would cost for a private carer to cover from 7pm to 8am \u2014 some \u00a3260, an impossible sum for us.\n\nJust as draining as the physical care was the endless jumping through hoops to get help.\n\nSocial services only visited Mum after I insisted we needed support, then told us we\u2019d get no financial help with care fees because she owns her own home.\n\nAnd, while Mum has been with her local GP practice for nearly 20 years, a doctor only came to see her five weeks after her discharge from hospital, and only then after I wrote a letter of stiff complaint to the surgery.\n\nOn top of lost earnings, we are having to pay \u00a3270 for three hours of private physiotherapy a week after being advised that the 20 minutes provided by the NHS is insufficient to get Mum anywhere close to walking again. Two hours of private speech therapy is \u00a3250 a week: the NHS provides some, but not enough, and the waiting list in Mum\u2019s area is eight months.\n\nMore important than any financial loss is the fact that we have lost the mother we had. She was a tour de force, suddenly reduced and robbed of the speech to match her quick intelligence. She says she feels a burden and, recently, she broke my heart when she asked if she had disappointed me \u2014 and if we thought this had happened because she doesn\u2019t believe in God.\n\nDo I miss having an independent, active Mum with whom I chatted on the phone at least once a day? Without doubt. There is crushing grief on her part and mine that those carefree days are gone.\n\nAfter family discussions, we three agreed that she would go into a local residential home for up to eight weeks to give us time and space to decide the next steps. It costs \u00a3700 a week, \u00a3480 of which is met by social services, leaving my sister and me to pay the balance.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping she likes it; that the social company, activities and feeling of safety at being looked after by professionals will make her more at ease with life. Should she decide to stay, we will have to sell her bungalow to pay her care home fees.\n\nBut all that really matters is Mum feeling comfortable and safe for the remainder of her life.\n\nShe is still struggling with speech. She can stand, though is not walking. After a struggle with low mood, she seems a little brighter.\n\nI asked her yesterday where she would be if she could be anywhere in the world. She said she\u2019d like to be walking my dog, Freddie, on the beach where this photo was taken. A simple wish but, sadly, one I cannot grant her. Maybe one day. We travel in hope.
