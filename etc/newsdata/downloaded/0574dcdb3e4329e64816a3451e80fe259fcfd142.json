All will be revealed next year.\"\n\n(Image: Alton Towers Resort)\n\nIt's no surprise that David's books caught the resort's attention. After all, he began writing children's books in 2008 and since then has published 12 children's novels, short story collections and picture books.\n\nNot to mention his book sales have exceeded 33 million copies worldwide to date.\n\nThe project has been two years in the making, with Alton Towers working closely with David and HarperCollins Children\u2019s Books.\n\nConstruction has already begun with a team of nearly 100 specialists working on the exciting expansion, which will coincide with Alton Towers' 40th anniversary next year.\n\nWant to plan ahead?
