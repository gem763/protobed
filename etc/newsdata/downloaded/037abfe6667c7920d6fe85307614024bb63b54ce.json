Semenza.\n\nThe Swedish Academy said: \"The fundamental importance of oxygen has been understood for centuries, but how cells adapt to changes in levels of oxygen has long been unknown.\"\n\nSir Peter Ratcliffe is based at the Francis Crick Institute and the University of Oxford in the UK, William Kaelin at Harvard in the US and Gregg Semenza at Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nOxygen\n\nOxygen is in every breath we take, our bodies are completely dependent on it for converting food into usable energy.\n\nBut oxygen levels vary in the body, particularly during exercise or at high altitude, or after a cut or wound disrupts the blood supply.\n\nWhen oxygen levels drop, cells are forced to rapidly adapt their metabolism.\n\nThe oxygen-sensing ability of the body can trigger the production of new red blood cells or the construction of new blood vessels.\n\nIt also has a role in the immune system and the earliest stages of our development inside the womb.\n\nHow does the body senses oxygen?\n\nThe story of how our bodies respond to oxygen levels was worked out back to front.\n\nIt was shown that a hormone, called erythropoietin or EPO - went up as oxygen levels went down, but why?\n\nPiece-by-piece, the trio solved the puzzle.\n\nFirst they showed that a cluster of proteins called hypoxia-inducible factor - or HIF - was able to bind to DNA (our genetic code) and change how it behaves. This is how levels of the hormone EPO increase in low oxygen.\n\nFurther work showed HIF is constantly being made by cells, but it is constantly destroyed when oxygen levels are normal.\n\nThe agent of destruction is another protein called VHL, but where does oxygen come into this?\n\nThe last breakthrough showed showed HIF and VHL could chemically react only when there was enough oxygen around.\n\nSo to tell the story in the correct order: when oxygen levels fall, VHL can no longer stick to HIF, so HIF levels build up and it is able change the way our DNA works.\n\nHow is this helping treat disease?\n\nUnderstanding and then manipulating the body's oxygen-sensing abilities is leading to ideas for new treatments.\n\nDrugs that tap into the oxygen-sensing system to boost red blood cells may also be an effective treatment for anaemia.\n\nMeanwhile in cancer, tumours can hijack the process to selfishly create new blood vessels and make it easier for the cancer to grow.\n\nSo drugs to reverse the process might help stop cancers from growing.\n\nThe role of oxygen-sensing is also being investigated in diseases from heart failure to chronic lung disease.\n\n\"The work of these three scientists and their teams has paved the way to a greater understanding of these common, life-threatening conditions and new strategies to treat them,\" Dr Andrew Murray from the University of Cambridge.\n\nHe added: \"Congratulations to the three new Nobel Laureates, this is richly deserved!\"\n\nPrevious winners\n\n2018 - James P Allison and Tasuku Honjo for discovering how to fight cancer using the body's immune system\n\n2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock\n\n2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste.\n\n2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi \u014cmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries.\n\n2014 - John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser for discovering the brain's navigating system.\n\n2013 - James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Sudhof for their discovery of how cells precisely transport material.\n\n2012 - Two pioneers of stem cell research - John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka - were awarded the Nobel after changing adult cells into stem cells.\n\n2011 - Bruce Beutler, Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman shared the prize after revolutionising the understanding of how the body fights infection.\n\n2010 - Robert Edwards for devising the fertility treatment IVF which led to the first \"test tube baby\" in July 1978.\n\n2009 - Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes.", "description": "British scientist Sir Peter Ratcliffe shares the 2019 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine.", "authors": ["James Gallagher", "Health", "Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CBE0/production/_109129125_gettyimages-1135478132.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
