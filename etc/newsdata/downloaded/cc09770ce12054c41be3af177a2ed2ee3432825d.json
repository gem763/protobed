Prince William wore a teal sherwani suit, a long dresscoat worn over trousers, while the Duchess of Cambridge wore a dress by British designer Jenny Packham in deep green, the colour of Pakistan\u2019s flag.\n\nForeign policy experts and officials have said the trip, the first by a British royal family member in more than a decade and made at the request of the British foreign office, represented a soft power push, which may help both sides further their diplomatic aims.\n\nIt comes as Britain seeks to reinvigorate its foreign relationships as the deadline looms for its departure from the European Union, while Pakistan works to repair its global image to boost tourism and investment.\n\nWilliam also mentioned the looming challenge of climate change to Pakistan, as well as the importance of women having access to education, two themes of a trip which has been described by palace officials as the most complex the couple have undertaken due to security issues.\n\nEarlier in the day the couple met Khan, a former international cricket star who the prince played cricket with in London as a child, at his official residence.\n\nBritain's Prince William, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan pose after a meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan October 15, 2019.

I was a big fan of my mother too,\u201d he replied.\n\nThey then visited the Margalla Hills National Park on the edge of Islamabad, which is under threat from poaching, wildfires, invasive species and littering.\n\nSlideshow (31 Images)\n\nFor the morning events, Kate wore a periwinkle blue silk shalwar kameez, the national outfit of Pakistan consisting of a loose tunic worn over trousers. Many on social media and in the fashion industry had been hoping she would don the outfit, which Princess Diana had worn during visits.\n\nThe designer, Maheen Khan, said on Twitter: \u201cIt is an honour to have been asked to create this outfit for the Duchess.\u201d\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s fashion choices, including a bright green tunic over white pants to meet with the Prime Minister, appeared to echo many of the colours and outfits worn by Diana.", "description": "Britain's Prince William said the United Kingdom and Pakistan share \"unique bonds\" in a speech at the country's national monument in Islamabad on Tuesday evening during a five-day visit to the South Asian nation with his wife Kate.", "authors": ["Charlotte Greenfield", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441067268&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0QK", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
