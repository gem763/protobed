And although Suzuki was allowed to pinch hit for the first time since his injury, he still cannot field his position.\n\n\u201cI was inching to get back in the box, in the game to help the team,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cIt was nice to be out there.\u201d\n\nBrian Dozier\u2019s go-ahead single to left off Miami reliever Jose Urena (4-10) scored Ryan Zimmerman from third. Zimmerman had led off the inning with a single and advanced to third on a single by Victor Robles. Adam Eaton had an RBI single and Juan Soto walked with the bases loaded in the inning.\n\nThe Nationals are atop the NL wild-card race, one game ahead of Milwaukee, which has a three-game lead for the second wild card.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t quit, they keep coming back and had some good at-bats late,\u201d Washington manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this all year. They\u2019re going to keep playing until the final out.\u201d\n\nWander Suero (6-8) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win and Tanner Rainey got the final three outs.\n\nNationals\u2019 starter Stephen Strasburg was lifted with a 2-0 lead after seven innings and 109 pitches. Strasburg allowed three hits, struck out six, walked three and hit a batter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about one, it\u2019s about all of us,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight until the very end.\u201d\n\nWashington squandered a 4-0 lead as the Marlins scored four runs in the eighth off reliever Fernando Rodney.\n\nAustin Dean\u2019s bases-loaded double against Rodney tied it. Rodney also allowed an RBI double to Starlin Castro, walked Isan Diaz and gave up a single to Harold Ramirez that loaded the bases.\n\n\u201cWe get some hits and we then we were just kind of able to keep grabbing that momentum,\u201d Marlins manager Don Mattingly said. \u201cSaw some good at bats in there, obviously.\u201d\n\nWashington increased its advantage in the eighth on Robles\u2019 run-scoring single and a fielders\u2019 choice by Gomes that scored Zimmerman from third.\n\nThe Nationals took an early lead on a run-scoring single by Strasburg in the second. Strasburg drove in Gomes, who had reached on a two-out double.\n\nCabrera increased Washington\u2019s lead with an RBI single in the fifth.\n\nMiami\u2019s Jordan Yamamoto, making his first start since Aug. 24, was lifted after a one-out walk to Anthony Rendon in the fifth. Yamamoto allowed two runs, six hits, struck out three and walked two.\n\n\u201cJust gotta be more efficient - it\u2019s been done,\u201d Yamamoto said. \u201cPeople can go six or seven innings with 80 pitches, so me going 4.1 innings, is kind of a disappointment to myself to the team. I felt like I let them down by not being able to go out there and put up a fight.\u201d\n\nRISKY ZIMMERMAN\n\nNot fleet of foot, Zimmerman got a good read on Robles\u2019 bloop single to right and took the extra base that allowed him to score on Dozier\u2019s single. The Nationals first baseman stumbled momentarily as he rounded second, but still beat the throw to third.\n\n\u201cOnce you see where the second baseman is at you just keep going,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cGetting to third there was the most important thing. It wasn\u2019t the smoothest but I made it.\u201d\n\nMATTINGLY\u2019S OFF-SEASON ADVICE TO YAMAMOTO\n\nYamamoto experienced immediate success after his major league call-up before a five-game losing streak that eventually landed him on the injured list. The rookie right-hander\u2019s final starts of the season won\u2019t reflect on how he will be viewed in spring training.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a start is going to change really anything for anybody,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cI think the fact that you\u2019re healthy and finishing the season is important. I think the real growth comes from, obviously, the off-season. That\u2019s when you get after your work. It\u2019s a work with a different purpose. Once you get to the big leagues and see what it takes what you\u2019re dealing with, your work becomes a lot more purposeful.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM:\n\nNationals: C Kurt Suzuki (right elbow inflammation) had a throwing session Friday and hopes to return to play the position before the end of the season. Suzuki has been sidelined since Sept. 8. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a day by day thing, seeing how I recover from the throwing,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s going as planned.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nNationals: RHP Austin Voth (1-1, 3.58) will make his first career start against Miami in the series finale Sunday.\n\nMarlins: RHP Pablo Lopez (5-8, 4.94) is 0-3 with a 7.17 ERA in his five starts since returning from the injured list Aug. 26.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kurt Suzuki made the most of his first at-bat following a lengthy absence.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/Nationals_Marlins_Baseball_19886.jpg-c99a2_c0-121-2903-1813_s1770x1032.jpg?d0e1e1f5f4c69f7f4021fdb8ea34e1d858545134", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
