Here she charts the agony of deciding whether or not to learn if she \u2013 and her teenage daughter \u2013 are destined for the same fate. As told to Anna Moore\n\nThere\u2019s a list of letters I want to write for the future. One is for my 19-year-old daughter Despina, to be read on her wedding day if she ever marries. My own mum wasn\u2019t at my wedding \u2013 she was in a care home with Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 and I\u2019ve always wondered what she would have said to me if she could have been there. I want Despina to have my words in a letter, in case the same happens to me.\n\nAnother is for my husband Chris, to tell him that it\u2019s OK to love someone else after I\u2019ve died. He hates me talking about it because, as far as he\u2019s concerned, he\u2019ll never meet anyone else, but I don\u2019t want that for him. I also want to put in writing that I don\u2019t want him to become my full-time carer. I want Chris to have a life.\n\nSophie with her daughter Despina. 'There\u2019s a list of letters I want to write for the future. One is for my 19-year-old daughter Despina, to be read on her wedding day if she ever marries'\n\nA third letter is for the genetic counsellor who takes Despina through the testing process, should she decide to be tested for the Alzheimer\u2019s mutation that I carry \u2013 the mutation that runs through our family, leading us to develop the disease in middle age. I want to say, \u2018This is my baby. She may be brave, she may think she can handle all this, but you need to talk it through so carefully. She is not just an NHS number. You are talking to the human being that I made. Don\u2019t screw it up.\u2019\n\nI was in my late teens when we felt the first signs of Alzheimer\u2019s in our family. Until then, I\u2019d had a fun, carefree childhood, growing up by the seaside in Great Yarmouth where my parents owned record shops. My mum loved dogs, food, wine, holidays, music \u2013 Bruce Springsteen was her thing \u2013 and she was very family-oriented, too. One of my most precious memories is whenever I was ill, she\u2019d buy me new pyjamas and make me hot Ribena.\n\nMy mum\u2019s elder sister, Heather, was the first to get symptoms. She was in her early 40s, having problems with her memory and experiencing anxiety. Getting nowhere with her doctors, she started looking into our family history for answers. Her dad \u2013 my maternal grandfather \u2013 had left the family when they were young, so they never knew him. But they did know he\u2019d been in the RAF, and used their records to trace him. My Auntie Heather discovered that he\u2019d recently died, and his death certificate listed \u2018pre-senile dementia\u2019 as a cause.\n\nSophie (right) aged 16 alongside her aunt Heather (already afflicted with Alzheimer\u2019s), grandmother Joan and mum Gillian, who would also get the disease early\n\nThat\u2019s the term that was used then \u2013 there was no mention of Alzheimer\u2019s. My auntie lived miles away in London and her children, my four cousins, were much younger than me. I think my mum struggled with her sister being ill. She wasn\u2019t able to face it and tried to avoid going down to see her \u2013 but then, by her 40s, mum also began having problems with anxiety and short-term memory loss. For a decade, she was going to the doctor but, again, nobody listened. She was signed off work but got no real diagnosis or proper support.\n\nAt that stage, I was enjoying my 20s. I worked in Crete for two years \u2013 Despina was my souvenir! \u2013 and later met and married Chris. I was angry with mum for not doing the things a mother should do when her daughter is pregnant or has a tiny baby. She didn\u2019t stay in touch very well. We had to go to visit her; she never came to us. On Despina\u2019s second birthday, Mum bought her an outfit for a five-year-old.\n\nLooking back, I feel very emotional that I was so cross. But I was in denial. My Auntie Heather was now in the late stage of the disease. My cousins had been getting involved in Alzheimer\u2019s research and discovered that the type affecting our mothers was called familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD), and it was genetic \u2013 each family member had a 50 per cent chance of inheriting the mutation. When they told me, I couldn\u2019t cope with thinking about it. I\u2019d just brought this new human being into the world.\n\nThe blankets Sophie has knitted, while she still can, for her future grandchildren\n\nMy mum was finally diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s at the age of 50 after first being sectioned \u2013 by then, she was wandering out of the house at night. She went straight from hospital to a care home, which I hated visiting. My sister was amazing; she\u2019d feed Mum and help her to the toilet, while I just sat and cried. All I could think was that I was looking at my own future. And that one day my daughter might be sitting watching me in that bed.\n\nIt\u2019s horrible for anybody to have a parent with Alzheimer\u2019s, but when it\u2019s genetic, it\u2019s not just about losing your parent; it\u2019s seeing what losing yourself is going to be like, and knowing exactly how that will feel for the people you love. I felt huge guilt because I wasn\u2019t being the daughter I should be.\n\nEverything changed when mum died in January 2012. She\u2019d lived for seven years in a care home and for four of those she was bed-bound. For the last ten days of her life, my sister and I lived in her room. I was finally there for her, doing all the things I wish I\u2019d done earlier.\n\nThe month after she died, I went to my first FAD support meeting in London with my cousins. There were about 40 people there who either knew for certain they\u2019d inherited the mutation or were at risk. They voiced everything I\u2019d felt but been unable to say: fear, guilt, anger. It was life-changing. The more involved I became, the more I learned. I became an Alzheimer\u2019s research geek and got involved in a worldwide drug trial for people at risk. I didn\u2019t expect it to save me but I\u2019m hoping there will be something learned for the next generation.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s \u2013 What you need to know Alzheimer\u2019s disease accounts for two-thirds of all dementia cases and affects more than 600,000 people in the UK. About 60 per cent of people living with the most common forms of Alzheimer\u2019s are women.\n\nDirectly inherited familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD) accounts for about one per cent of dementia cases and affects as many men as women.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s is believed to be linked to the build-up of two proteins, amyloid and tau, in the brain. As the disease progresses, more and more nerve cells become damaged, causing loss of memory and communication skills, along with a decline in ability to think and reason clearly.\n\nGenetic testing is not available on the NHS for most cases of Alzheimer\u2019s as it\u2019s likely to be caused by a combination of risk factors, but for those with a strong family history \u2013 where relatives have developed the condition in their 30s, 40s and 50s \u2013 the NHS offers predictive gene testing for over-18s. A positive test result means an individual carries the gene and will go on to develop the disease.\n\nThough we can\u2019t change our genetic inheritance, there\u2019s mounting evidence that good cardiovascular (heart) health can reduce your risk \u2013 keeping blood pressure and cholesterol under control, maintaining an active lifestyle and healthy weight, not smoking and not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week.\n\nIf someone you know has been recently diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, talk to them directly, ask how they feel, how you can help and what they want. Don\u2019t ask their partner or their children. The more you understand, the longer you can stay on board to support them.\n\nSophie is supporting Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK\u2019s #ShareTheOrange campaign highlighting that dementia is caused by physical diseases which can be tackled through research. For more information, including organisations that support people affected by dementia, go to alzheimersresearchuk.org\n\nFor years, although there was a test available, I didn\u2019t want to know whether I carried the mutation. I thought that if I tested positive, I might kill myself or never get out of bed again. I needed the 50 per cent hope.\n\nChris didn\u2019t want me to get tested either. He was convinced I didn\u2019t have it \u2013 in fact, lots of the family felt the same. One cousin had granted me power of attorney for that reason. The disease has taken more than half of us (several family members from my generation are living with symptoms now), so there was a feeling that one of us had to test negative. People thought it would be me.\n\nBy 2017, now in my 40s, I wanted to know for certain. Despina was growing up, taking A-levels, and there were things I wanted to do with my life. Chris and I had a dream of selling our house and living on a canal boat, but living on water \u2013 getting on- and offboard when you have Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 isn\u2019t the best idea. I also wanted a career change (I was a Slimming World consultant), but what if I began retraining then discovered I couldn\u2019t learn any more?\n\nThough really scared, I was ready to know. I had two sessions with a genetic counsellor, one alone and one with Chris. They wanted to be sure that I fully understood the implications of finding out. You can never unhear that information. Two tubes of blood were drawn then, on 11 May 2018, Chris and I went back for the results.\n\nA consultant and a genetics nurse were there. The consultant told me that I had tested positive. Immediately, I wanted to get out of the room. I cried and kept saying sorry to Chris, because the future was going to be so much worse for him. He told me to stop apologising. We stayed in a London hotel, and I woke up crying in the night. I cried all the way home on the train to Lowestoft, too. I knew I\u2019d have to tell our daughter when we got back.\n\nSophie today, aged 43\n\nDespina was almost 18. I tried to be as positive as I could, and said that I was exactly the same person I\u2019d been the day before. This disease would still have come for me \u2013 the only difference was that we now had the knowledge. She has since told me that she wants to get tested too, maybe after university when she\u2019s more settled. I tried to say the right things \u2013 \u2018Talk to people your own age in the same situation\u2019, \u2018I\u2019m here if you want me\u2019 \u2013 then went upstairs and sobbed my heart out. How amazing it would be if she doesn\u2019t have it. I definitely want to be alive to hear it. But if she does? I feel I\u2019m the only person who would have the right words to say to her.\n\nSince getting the results, I\u2019m monitoring myself for symptoms but I\u2019m probably less stressed about it compared to when I was living with the risk hanging over me. In the past, if I forgot anything, I\u2019d think, \u2018Oh my God, does this mean I have it?\u2019 Now I know I do, so I don\u2019t need to continually ask that question. My hope is that as problems begin to arise, I can think, \u2018That\u2019s an Alzheimer\u2019s thing. What small change might make that aspect of life easier?\u2019 Everyone is watching me like a hawk, but we genuinely don\u2019t think there are any signs yet. It\u2019s ironic because Chris\u2019s memory is ten times worse than mine!\n\nMy focus now is looking after myself, eating and sleeping really well and getting plenty of exercise. I run a lot. There\u2019s mounting evidence that this can make a difference and delay the start of symptoms. I left my Slimming World job; I loved it but it was all-consuming and I wanted to remove as much stress as possible. I\u2019m now an assistant at Argos.\n\nA big priority for me is making memories for the people who matter. They\u2019ll need good ones to balance out the horrible things to come. We\u2019ve had weekends away, a birthday trip to Budapest, in the summer we went to Wimbledon before I forget what tennis is. It really bothers me that any future grandchildren might not get to know the \u2018real me\u2019 so I\u2019ve knitted them baby blankets. I hope they\u2019ll feel my love every time they snuggle into them.\n\nI\u2019m really lucky that I have an amazing family. We talk about the Alzheimer\u2019s openly \u2013 there\u2019s no need for big, serious conversations. We even joke about it. When I asked Chris if I should have a tummy tuck, he told me there was no point: eventually I won\u2019t remember where my tummy is! It doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re in denial. You can laugh as well as cry about it \u2013 and then get on with doing things sooner rather than later.\n\nThere is so much misunderstanding around Alzheimer\u2019s. People think that it\u2019s just something inevitable that happens when you\u2019re old. But it\u2019s a disease, and like any other disease, one day, with more research and understanding, it could be prevented or cured. One in three babies born today will get some form of dementia in their lifetime. If we raise funds and awareness about Alzheimer\u2019s, the way women have for breast cancer, then breakthroughs can be made \u2013 and life for our children could be very different.", "description": "After watching dementia claim her mother and aunt, Sophie Leggett charts the agony of deciding whether to take the test to see if she or her daughter carry the faulty gene", "authors": ["Anna Moore"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/16/19260618-0-image-a-98_1570117760159.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
