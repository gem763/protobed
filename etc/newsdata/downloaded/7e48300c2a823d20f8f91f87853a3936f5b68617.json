Backup Ryan Tannehill took over in the game - and perhaps going forward.\n\nNot that Titans coach Mike Vrabel was willing to address that in the aftermath of a game in which his offense had nearly as many punts (nine) as first downs (12).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know as soon as I figure it out,\u201d Vrabel said.\n\nIt was a confounding afternoon for Mariota, whose stat line wasn\u2019t pretty: 7 of 18 for 63 yards passing. A 9.5 passer rating. Two picks. Sacked three times.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t give our guys a chance to make plays,\u201d said Mariota, the No. 2 pick overall in the 2015 draft. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s some of the reasons why I got pulled.\u201d\n\nTannehill took over with 4:56 left in the third and the Titans trailing 13-0. They were searching for some sort of spark from Tannehill, who was acquired in a trade with Miami in March as an insurance policy in case Mariota got hurt again.\n\nThe veteran Tannehill only produced two first downs until his final drive. He finished 13 of 16 for 144 yards and one interception. He was sacked four times as the Broncos completed their first shutout since December 2017.\n\n\u201cI just wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Tannehill said. \u201cWe have to be better all the way around, and I have to be better.\u201d\n\nWith Mariota running the show, the Titans (2-4) managed just six first downs and 88 total yards. A week earlier, they scored just once in a loss to Buffalo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not pulling our weight as an offense,\u201d Mariota said. \u201cWe have to find a way to improve and change that because our defense is playing lights out.\u201d\n\nVrabel said Mariota wasn\u2019t happy about the benching, but \u201che took it like a pro. \u2026 I don\u2019t think any of us were happy. When we lose, nobody\u2019s happy.\u201d\n\nMariota offered Tannehill some advice before he stepped in.\n\n\u201cTrust what you see and go play,\u201d Mariota recounted.\n\nSo that\u2019s what the former Dolphins starter tried to do. But that\u2019s a difficult task against Von Miller and Co., who earned their first shutout in two years.\n\n\u201cI thought the ball was coming out good. I felt my locations were good,\u201d Tannehill said. \u201cDefinitely felt like it had been a while since I\u2019d played. But I thought I was able to settle in and find some open guys.\u201d\n\nTannehill said he\u2019s spoken with Mariota and there\u2019s nothing but mutual respect.\n\n\u201cWe have a great relationship,\u201d Tannehill said. \u201cThese things are tough no matter how you cut it. I think the only thing that makes it somewhat tolerable is that we do have a good relationship and we have a ton of respect for each other.\u201d\n\nAsked if he was hoping this was a one-week deal and he\u2019d be in there against the Los Angeles Chargers next week, Mariota said: \u201cFor me as a competitor, I would love to be out there with my guys. But again it\u2019s going to come down to the coaches and what they decide.\u201d\n\nPressed if this was his team, Mariota responded: \u201cAbsolutely. Absolutely. No matter what, I\u2019m a team player. If they call my number, I\u2019ll be ready to go and I\u2019ll make the most of the opportunity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Marcus Mariota was blasted, baffled and finally benched.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/titans_broncos_football_23446_c0-204-4895-3059_s1200x700.jpg?8b97c584551911a75ef1791227739dcc0078080e", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
