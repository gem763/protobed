Miller plays Deb, a single mother (actually, a grandmother) whose life alters when her teenage daughter, Bridget (the pop singer Sky Ferreira), goes missing. The film is not a whodunnit but a slice-of-life drama that sticks by Deb\u2019s side as she spends the next 11 years raising Bridget\u2019s son and attempting something of a normal life after the trauma of losing her daughter.\n\nDeb is a magnetic creation: funny, lewd, mostly pragmatic, though her head is occasionally overruled by her bodily passions. She drinks boxed wine; she attracts and is attracted to unsuitable and abusive men. Miller\u2019s finely tuned performance manages to be tough and sparky and just world-weary enough, without slipping into one-size-fits-all inspirational \u201csurvivor\u201d cliche.\n\nAdmittedly, some stretches of the film have more energy than others. Deb\u2019s whirlwind relationship with nice guy Chris (Breaking Bad\u2019s Aaron Paul, miscast here) feels draggy. Infinitely more watchable is the intimate and frequently testy interplay between Miller and Christina Hendricks, who plays Deb\u2019s more traditional older sister.", "description": "A woman\u2019s attempts to rebuild her life and raise her grandson after her daughter vanishes", "authors": ["Simran Hans"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8374efc9fecb7872e447fdb2da6f8530fba2558/247_0_1342_805/master/1342.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=22353d27fc7a025eff44f81646776a0a", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
