If anyone still doubted it, they just had to note the reactions to the Observer\u2019s article last weekend on the dirtiness of the French capital. Under a headline condemning Paris as \u201cthe dirty man of Europe\u201d, Kim Willsher wrote how, despite the efforts of the city\u2019s authorities to improve the cleanliness of streets, this is an issue that is causing considerable concern to Parisians. She quoted an American professor who has lived in the city for the best part of 30 years as saying that Paris was \u201cfilthy everywhere\u201d. And even if the piece reminded us of the large amount city hall spends on cleaning the city \u2013 around \u20ac500m (\u00a3445m) a year \u2013 and noted its \u201cgrand schemes\u201d to combat air pollution, it certainly touched a nerve.\n\nParis was no worse than any other major city, insisted some angry readers on social media. Le Parisien described it as a \u201cvitriolic article\u201d. The mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had to go on French radio to defend her record and said the same sort of article had been written about Rome and London. She couldn\u2019t put a rubbish collector behind every Parisian, she declared.\n\nHidalgo\u2019s opponents seized on her response as fresh evidence of a lack of willingness to tackle the subject, while her supporters saw the whole thing as an all-out attack.\n\nWhy such a response? Willsher has noted that articles by Spanish or Italian journalists recently published on the same subject have not aroused such virulent reactions.\n\nIn my opinion, the explanation is to be found in the very special relationship between France and England. Enemies for hundreds of years, our two countries have managed to mitigate their ancestral rivalry with time and, during the second world war, responded to the call of history, sealing their alliance with the spilling of blood.\n\nStill, in the collective unconscious \u2013 on both sides of the Channel \u2013 a certain sensitivity persists.\n\nBut what of the substance of Willsher\u2019s piece? It is hard to argue with that. Even Le Parisien, asking \u201cIs Paris really that dirty?\u201d, ran a video last week showing city streets with litter and dog dirt as well as overflowing rubbish bins. The magazine where I work, Marianne, ran a piece in March under the headline: \u201cBehind the postcard, Paris dustbin city\u201d. Beyond a few quibbles from city hall staff on the choice of our cover photo, the matter rested there.\n\nSince then, a new element has entered the equation: the appearance of new candidates challenging Hidalgo in next year\u2019s elections, including a former government spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux, and the mathematician C\u00e9dric Villani, also an MP.\n\nA fun detail is that they are both supporters of Emmanuel Macron. Winning over Paris represents a major challenge for the republic\u2019s president. If Macron\u2019s friends take the capital in 2020, it would allow him to enter a second presidential election under the best auspices.\n\nThe opposite result would be perceived as a dark omen. Hidalgo knows this perfectly well and is an obstacle even if, according to the latest opinion polls, she continues to lead in the municipal race by a slim margin: voting intentions put her at 24%, ahead of Griveaux at 19% and Villani on 15%.\n\nAs Willsher noted, the question of Paris\u2019s cleanliness remains the primary concern of those who live there. The subject is sensitive. Appetites are whetted, knives are sharpened. Last week\u2019s Observer report was only the pretext for an initial round in this municipal campaign. A first controversy to warm up. It will certainly not be the last.\n\nBruno Rieth is a reporter for Marianne magazine", "description": "The Observer\u2019s report on the French capital hit a nerve in the press and on social media \u2013 especially as an election looms", "authors": ["Bruno Rieth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d271a118109d7c1c8b819ca9771d3518f751d648/0_188_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a48f9ee02ddc028003989a4de76c3238", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
