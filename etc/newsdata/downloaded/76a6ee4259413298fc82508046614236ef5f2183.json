He has been part of the Cloverly Civic Association since the 1980s, as well as president for many of those years, and was involved in the development of the Cloverly Master Plan, a document published in July 1997.\n\nThe document lays out principles that have helped Cloverly maintain its bucolic character. One of these is to retain low-density residential zoning of most underdeveloped property.\n\nRemein said this ensures that Cloverly will stay a \u201clow-density community with a rural character.\u201d\n\nThe community has \u201cbeen developed pretty much as planned,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission decided to sell the land in Cloverly it had been using as a sludge disposal site, the residents made sure it was developed in keeping with the master plan.\n\n[D.C.\u2019s Takoma is a neighborhood that fought for diversity and still reaps its benefits]\n\n\u201cThe first thing that came to their mind was to develop it as a commercial site for businesses,\u201d Remein said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large tract of property and we discouraged that activity and we encouraged the activity of it being built as a residential community surrounding a golf course.\u201d\n\nIt eventually became Hampshire Greens, with construction starting in 1995. Residents began moving into the neighborhood in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloverly is home to many places of worship representing a variety of faiths \u2014 such as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Parish and the Jain Society of Metropolitan Washington.

He said Cloverly\u2019s proximity to the District is one reason he believes people from different backgrounds come to worship there.\n\n\u201cD.C. is not just a hub of the nation,\u201d Albright said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hub of the world, and it has a draw and an appeal to diverse backgrounds and people from all walks of life. . . . There\u2019s only so much room. And at some point, you have to spread out. And I think you see that all around D.C.\u201d\n\n[With high-rises and one \u2018hidden gem,\u2019 an urban center is sprouting in Tysons West]\n\nHe said New Hampshire Avenue has been referred to as the \u201cHighway to Heaven.\u201d\n\nThe Jain Society of Metropolitan Washington was established in 1980. It started with 20 members and has now grown to over 635, according to its website.\n\nNavin Vora, the society\u2019s facilities director, said the Jain Society was drawn to Cloverly was because it offered abundant space.\n\nThe society\u2019s founding members and a monk \u201cfound a nice place here in Cloverly \u2014 large land the way they needed \u2014 and according to all our religious things, it was suitable for them to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main reason to have [a] temple in Cloverly is that most of [the] people were in surrounding areas and our monk chose this place.\u201d\n\nJainism\u2019s motto is \u201clive and let live,\u201d he said. It is based on the precepts of nonviolence and non-possessiveness, he wrote.\n\nSheila Stewart, who\u2019s lived in Cloverly for nearly 37 years, loves that she can see many places of worship traveling along New Hampshire Avenue.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a child, they used to say that if you don\u2019t go to church, it is your fault because you can find congregation/denomination along New Hampshire Ave.,\u201d she said via email.\n\n\n\nSt. Andrew Ukrainian Church is one of the many places of worship on New Hampshire Avenue.
