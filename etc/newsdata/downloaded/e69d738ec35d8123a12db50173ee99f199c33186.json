She had filed a police complaint against Siraj ud-Daula, the head of the seminary where she was a student. When she refused, she was instead lured to the roof of her seminary by some of her fellow students, who tied her up, doused her in kerosene and set her on fire.\n\nShe managed to flee, and on the way to the hospital her brother recorded her naming her attackers. Nusrat died four days later, on April 10, and her killing sent shockwaves across the country and the world.\n\nOn Thursday, a Bangaldesh court sentenced 16 men accused in the murder of Nusrat Jahan Rafi to death, including the man Nusrat accused of harassment.\n\n\"The verdict proves that nobody will get away with murder in Bangladesh. We have the rule of law,\" prosecutor Hafez Ahmed told reporters after the verdict in a crowded courtroom.\n\n#JusticeForNusrat\n\nNusrat\u2019s death became a symbol for the culture which does turn a blind eye to women\u2019s complaints of sexual harassment and abuse. She had gone to the police to file a complaint, and instead a video of her sobbing was leaked to the local media. When she had gone to police in late March to report the sexual harassment, the officer filmed her statement and reportedly posted it on social media without her consent.\n\nIn the video, Rafi can be seen crying, visibly distressed, and trying to hide her face with her hands. The police officer is heard saying it's \"not a big deal\" and telling her to \"move your hands from the face, stop crying, nothing happened that you have to cry.\"\n\nAfter she filed her report, ud-Daula was arrested, but Rafi and her family reportedly started receiving death threats from the principal's supporters.\n\nThe abject callousness with which Nusrat was treated, and the threats that followed, all culminated in her painful death. Nusrat\u2019s death became the catalyst of protests, which demanded that the country relook at the systems which fail to protect women. .\n\nSimilar cases in India\n\nIndia does not fare any better, when it comes to how we treat survivors of sexual assault.The law student who accused BJP politician Swami Chinmayanand was arrested for extortion. He was in prison for only two days. The rape survivor has been remanded to 14 days judicial custody.\n\nA 2017 report by Human Rights Watch found that insensitive cops are among the primary reasons why Indian women do not report rape. Through field research in the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan (that record the highest number of rape cases in the country), the study identified that untrained police officials, insensitive health workers, and lack of legal support make justice unattainable for most sexual assault survivors in the country.\n\n\n\n", "description": "In April, Nusrat Jahan Rafi, 19 was burned alive as punishment for filing a sexual harassment complaint against the head of the seminary where she was a student.
