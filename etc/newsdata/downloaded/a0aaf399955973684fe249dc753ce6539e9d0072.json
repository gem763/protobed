Jenner, the former Olympic decathlon champ who announced her gender transition a few years back, laughed at the jokes as she sat on stage next to Robert De Niro and Baldwin.\n\n(The roasters traditionally go after each other, as well.)\n\nIn perhaps Griffin\u2019s most memorable line, he feigned seriousness while Jenner motioned for him to get to the inevitable punch line.\n\n\u201cAs an athlete, I want to thank you for your bravery,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cAs a human, I want to thank you for the doors you\u2019ve opened. And on behalf of the entire NBA and half of the rappers on the Billboard charts, I wanna thank you for giving your daughters their daddy issues.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cRoast of Alec Baldwin\u201d airs on Sept. 15.", "description": "The NBA star earned laughs from the 1976 Olympic champion in a racy routine.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77aaeb2400002e2a77ca2b.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
