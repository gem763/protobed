The victory would also give Williams the most U.S. Open singles titles (seven) and most U.S. Open match victories at Flushing Meadows (101).\n\nShe would also join a list of three other female tennis icons -- Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong, and Kim Clijsters -- who won a Grand Slam singles title after becoming a mother.\n\n1 MORE FOR 24: SERENA WILLIAMS REACHES US OPEN FINAL AGAIN\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool that I\u2019ve been in more finals than anyone on tour after being pregnant. That\u2019s kind of awesome,\u201d Williams said ahead of the match. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to go through what I did and come back \u2014 and so fast. To keep playing, to also not be 20 years old \u2014 yeah, I\u2019m pretty proud of myself.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who is ranked eighth in the world, has looked strong the past two matches, defeating Qiang Wang in the quarterfinals before taking out Elina Svitloina 6-3, 6-1 in the semifinals. In fact, she's only dropped one set in the entire tournament -- against up-and-coming American Caty McNally in the second round.\n\nThe tennis superstar is also attempting to win the U.S. Open a year after losing to Naomi Osaka in last year's finals, a game that had its share of penalties and controversy.\n\nWhen she was asked about last year's final, Williams said: \"It hasn't really crossed my mind.\"\n\nAt 19, Andreescu is 18 years younger than Williams and wasn't even born when the American won her first Grand Slam in 1999 at the U.S. Open. This will be the biggest age gap in a women\u2019s Grand Slam singles final in the Open era, which began in 1968.\n\nThe 15th-ranked Canadian is playing in her fourth Grand Slam but had never made it past the second round at the U.S. Open. She's only lost two sets this tournament and won her previous matchup against Williams, who retired with a back injury in last month's Rogers Cup.\n\nINTO US OPEN SEMIS, ANDREESCU TRIES TO BECOME CANADA'S CHAMP\n\n\"It feels pretty good because you never know what can happen in a match. I'm trying not to take anything for granted right now. I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing,\" said Andreescu.\n\nAndreescu has won 12 consecutive matches on summer hardcourts and hasn't lost a completed match since March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just surreal. I really don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said Andreescu after defeating Belinda Bencic in the semifinals on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true playing against Serena in the final of the U.S. Open. Hopefully, I can just keep the momentum going for the final.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWilliams praised her opponent ahead of the match.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a great player,\u201d she said. \u201cShe mixes things up. You never know what is going to come from her. She serves well, moves well, has a ton of power. She\u2019s very exciting to watch. It\u2019s good. I think it\u2019s great for women\u2019s tennis.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Serena Williams\u00a0hits the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Saturday in her latest bid to capture another historic\u00a0record\u00a0in her U.S. Open finals matchup against Canadian Bianca Andreescu.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/TEN-Serena-Williams16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
