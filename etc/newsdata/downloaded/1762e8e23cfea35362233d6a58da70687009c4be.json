But that product comprised just 34 per cent of Fortescue's exports in recent months.\n\nFortescue has also introduced a new higher grade product called \"West Pilbara Fines\", which made up 10 per cent of all exports in recent months.\n\nFortescue received an average price of $US85 per tonne over the past three months, and that was 89 per cent better than in the same period of 2019.\n\nThe benchmark iron ore price was $US85.70 per tonne on October 21, and based on the discount reported on Thursday, Fortescue would be receiving more than $US76 for each tonne of iron ore it exports.\n\nFortescue shipped 42.2 million tonnes in the three months ended September 30; putting the company behind the pace required to meet its full year export target of between 170 million and 175 million tonnes.\n\nFortescue said its export rate had been crimped by some recent maintenance, and it retained its full year export guidance, implying export rates would rise in coming months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorgans analyst Adrian Prendergast said Fortescue had performed well in the September quarter, but he doubted the company's stock could continue to defy the declines in iron ore prices over the past four months.\n\n''We maintain a positive view on FMG as a business, but view the market implied valuation as unsustainably high,'' he said in a note.\n\n''Benchmark spot iron ore prices have fallen 28 per cent since their July 2019 peak, while FMG's share price has risen 5 per cent during the same time.\n\n''We don't expect this breakdown in fundamentals to be sustained.''\n\nFortescue had gross debt of $US3.9 billion at September 30, but has no repayments due until 2022.", "description": "Once famous for its high risk approach to debt-fuelled growth, Fortescue was almost net cash at September 30.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/50cffa05d096ac44576a91c6d58782ac517d517f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
