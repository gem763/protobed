(AP) - A southern Indiana high school baseball complex will be named in honor of the founder of Papa John\u2019s who opened his first pizza restaurant in the city, even though his name was last year stripped from another renovation project because he made racist comments.\n\nJohn Schnatter opened his first Papa John\u2019s restaurant in Jeffersonville in 1984. In the decades that followed, the restaurant grew into a nationwide chain. But in 2017, Schnatter stepped down as CEO and last year resigned as chair after facing backlash for blaming disappointing sales on NFL player protests and for using racist language during a company conference call.\n\nThe Greater Clark County Schools board voted Tuesday to rename Jeffersonville High School\u2019s baseball facility the John H. Schnatter Stadium, the News and Tribune reported. Schnatter attended Jeffersonville High and played on the school\u2019s state finalist baseball team in 1980. His foundation will provide $500,000 to renovate the complex.\n\nJeffersonville Mayor Mike Moore said he\u2019s disappointed by the decision.\n\n\u201cI guess everybody has to look in the mirror and do what they think is right. Obviously, we chose to go a different direction,\u201d said Moore.\n\nIn 2018, Moore returned money that Schnatter had donated to renovate the Nachand Fieldhouse, a basketball gym and event space, which was going to be named for him. Schnatter\u2019s name was also removed from Jeffersonville\u2019s Wall of Champions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud that we did what we did,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut the school board has to answer to the public and what comes along with every decision they make. That\u2019s on them.\u201d\n\nBoard members noted that they did seek community feedback.\n\n\u201cI specifically asked my constituents who are African American about this and the vast majority said a $500K donation, take it,\u201d board member Teresa Bottorff-Perkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s what it is. I\u2019m not going to deny the kids . from an updated baseball field because of a statement that (Schnatter) made.\u201d\n\nDerek Ellis, Jeffersonville High School\u2019s head baseball coach who attended the meeting with some of his players, said he was \u201cextremely excited\u201d and that he approves of naming the facility after Schnatter. Ellis added that he hopes to soon get bids for the baseball complex renovation, so students will be able to play on the new turf in 2020.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: News and Tribune, Jeffersonville, Ind., http://www.newsandtribune.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A southern Indiana high school baseball complex will be named in honor of the founder of Papa John's who opened his first pizza restaurant in the city, even though his name was last year stripped from another renovation project because he made racist comments.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
