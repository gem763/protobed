Facebook has been a longstanding and valued strategic partner to PayPal, and we will continue to partner with and support Facebook in various capacities.\u201d\n\nA high-profile, would-be partner like PayPal backing out from the effort before it\u2019s even gotten off the ground is a big blow to Facebook and the Libra Association, which has been struggling under the weight of speculation that some of the big organizations, initially interested in collaborating on Libra, are now on the fence about the project, put off by wave of negative reaction from regulators and others that might lead to problems launching and ultimately growing the service.\n\nIn response, the Libra Association has come out with an understated but scathing statement of its own in response to PayPal\u2019s announcement. (Facebook had referred our questions to the group and did not comment directly.)\n\n\u201cIt requires a certain boldness and fortitude to take on an endeavor as ambitious as Libra \u2013 a generational opportunity to get things right and improve financial inclusion,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cThe journey will be long and challenging. The type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard. Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else. We\u2019re better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later.\u201d\n\nPayPal is the first firm to walk away from the Libra Association, but it comes at a difficult time for the project, even before it has launched.\n\nBoth regulators and other government bodies on both sides of the Atlantic \u2014 already scrutinizing Facebook and cryptocurrency as separate issues \u2014 have honed in on the project with concerns of how a Facebook-backed and promoted currency could lead to anti-competitive behavior.\n\nFacebook and other members of the Libra Association are due to meet this month in Geneva to appoint its first board of directors, but ahead of that it\u2019s been reported that the government scrutiny has started to spook some who have only nominally backed the project at this point.\n\nThe WSJ reported earlier this week that Mastercard, Visa and other companies may join PayPal in backing away from the Libra project. Mastercard has not responded to a request for comment, but Visa\u2019s CEO Al Kelly has made public statements that underscore Visa\u2019s provisional support for Libra \u2014 a position we understand remains unchanged as of today, provided regulatory and other issues do not get in the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the facts here and not any of us get out ahead of ourselves,\u201d Kelly said in the company\u2019s most recent earnings call. \u201cSo we have signed a nonbinding letter of intent to join Libra. We\u2019re one of \u2013 I think it\u2019s 27 companies that have expressed that interest. So no one has yet officially joined. We\u2019re in discussions and our ultimate decision to join will be determined by a number of factors, including obviously the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements\u2026 It\u2019s really, really early days and there\u2019s just a tremendous amount to be finalized. But obviously, given that we\u2019ve expressed interest, we actually believe we could be additive and helpful in the association.\u201d\n\nAs we reported when Libra first launched, Facebook doesn\u2019t control the Libra organization or currency, but gets a single vote alongside the remaining partners. Those that have endorsed the association currently include, alongside Mastercard and Visa, Stripe, Uber and the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz. Each Libra Association partner invests at least $10 million in the project and the association will promote the open-sourced Libra Blockchain.\n\nThe partners would not only pitch the Libra Blockchain and developer platform with its own Move programming language, but sign up businesses to accept Libra for payment and even give customers discounts or rewards.\n\nFacebook has a lot riding on the success of the Association beyond just its Libra stake. The company has also launched a subsidiary company called Calibra that handles crypto transactions on its platform that would use the Libra blockchain. (It\u2019s been quietly developing this alongside the Libra effort, including making acquisitions to expand the functionality around how it will work.)\n\nGovernments around the world have been up in arms because they are concerned that, with Libra, Facebook and its partners will try to make an end run around existing financial services and their corresponding regulations.\n\nPerhaps in response to these pressures and how they might play out, earlier this month, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg indicated that the company would be willing to delay the launch of the cryptocurrency \u2014 it is currently planned for 2020 \u2014 in an interview with the Japanese Nikkei news service. \u201cMove fast and break things\u201d won\u2019t be getting applied here.", "description": "PayPal has become the first company to walk away officially from Facebook\u2019s Libra, a cryptocurrency and related association that it announced earlier this year\u00a0with a chain of nearly 30 big names behind the effort to help build and operate services around it. \u201cPayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra Association [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Libra_Association_Founding_Partners.png?w=551", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
