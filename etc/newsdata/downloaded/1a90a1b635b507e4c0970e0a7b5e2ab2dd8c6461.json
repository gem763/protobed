Apparently, the switch happened back in June, according to Lt. Col. Jason Rossi, commander of the Air Force\u2019s 595th Strategic Communications Squadron.\n\nUp until June, if the US president ordered a nuclear strike, military officials would have to rely on floppy disks to activate the 70s-era IBM Series /1 mainframe computer that the system runs on.\n\nThese little beauties could store up to 80kb of data \u2013 gradually that went up to 1.44MB (iStockphoto)\n\nWhile that may seem ridiculous, officials point out that the age of the system gives it a certain measure of security.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I joke with people and say it\u2019s the Air Force\u2019s oldest IT system. But it\u2019s the age that provides that security,\u2019 Rossi said.\n\n\u2018You can\u2019t hack something that doesn\u2019t have an IP address. It\u2019s a very unique system \u2014 it is old and it is very good.\u2019\n\nA conventionally configured ground-launched cruise missile is launched by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) during a test (Reuters)\n\nThe US Air Force is currently looking at a replacement for SACCS, not least because it takes a long time to train newer engineers on how to use the older tech.", "description": "The Strategic Automated Command and Control System was developed in the 70s", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91816205_1571910595.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
