It\u2019s the economy, stupid. But the record-low unemployment rate shouldn\u2019t give Trump nor markets any comfort.\n\nFull employment doesn\u2019t signal a strong economy at all. It is actually a historically sure sign that the U.S. economy is teetering on the edge of collapse.\n\nIn fact, every record low unemployment rate since 1950 precedes a recession and bear market within an average of under 12 months. That\u2019s why the Dow Jones rally over the latest job numbers Friday proves the stock market is clueless about where it\u2019s going.\n\nHistorical U.S. Unemployment Rate Graph Since 1950\n\nThe shaded areas in the graph below indicate U.S. recessions. As you can see, each U.S. recession is preceded by unemployment falling to its record low since the previous recession.\n\nThe following graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows both multi-year bear markets since 1996 began shortly after the unemployment rate hit record lows.\n\nIn light of these historical data, headlines like this one from the Associated Press on Oct. 4, are incomprehensible: \u201cStocks climb Friday after unemployment rate hits 50-year low.\u201d\n\nThese people are not serious capitalists.\n\nIt gives one the unnerving sense that the people moving around the most money in capital markets are historically and economically illiterate. Wall Street\u2019s coffers are apparently ringing with easy cash doled out by the Federal Reserve to naive newsreaders with a facile interpretation of the headlines, another sure sign of an imminent market correction.\n\nTrump Economy Is a House of Cards\n\nThe \u201cTrump economy\u201d in this context refers to the economy during the administration of Donald Trump. It should not necessarily be interpreted as referring specifically to the Trump administration\u2019s fiscal and regulatory policies.\n\nThese economic phenomena are cyclical in nature and driven largely by the monetary policy of the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve. Perhaps it would be more accurate here to speak of the Bernanke-Yellen-Powell economy.\n\nWhile strong job figures look like a strong economy to the historically uninformed, thinking about capital markets economically reveals why the opposite is true.\n\nThe overall employment rate is a very lagging indicator of economic growth. Full employment is the final stage of economic booms fueled by monetary expansion.\n\nBy the time enough capital has \u201ctrickled down,\u201d in the parlance of Reaganomics, to create a maximum of quantity demanded in labor markets across all sectors, the massive expansion of credit that made the boom possible has nearly exhausted itself.\n\nWhether or not it\u2019s the president\u2019s fault, as the economy goes, so goes the electorate. That\u2019s why the latest jobs numbers portend an uphill reelection campaign for Donald Trump. The unemployment rate has nowhere left to go but up, and the 2020 election is 13 months away.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Trump-Reuters-Yuri.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
