The company whiffed on the cloud. It also whiffed on mobile. And even in AI (artificial intelligence) \u2013 in which IBM has invested for a long time \u2013 the results have been mixed.\n\nThe irony is that IBM should have been a huge beneficiary of these trends. It has a trusted brand, a global footprint (it has 60 datacenters across the world) and a massive customer base. But unfortunately, the company did not adapt quickly enough.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Good News for IBM Stock\n\nDespite all its problems, IBM is still healthy from a financial standpoint, as it continues to generate substantial cash flows. The company also has incredibly talented employees.\n\nMore importantly for IBM stock, the company has made critical moves to restructure its operations. Specifically, it has eliminated jobs and unloaded non-core assets, while also retooling its software to keep up with the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I think the most consequential point is that the company has been willing to make big bets, as shown by its $34 billion mega-acquisition of Red Hat.\n\nTrue, there is a good deal of irony in this deal. When Linux and other open-source software platforms emerged in the 1990s, IBM\u2019s reaction was to fight back \u2013 and hard.\n\nBut it was a losing battle. Open-source software has become a critical part of companies\u2019 arsenals. So with the Red Hat deal, IBM has become the leader of the space.\n\nThere are clear benefits to open-source software. Specifically, adoption of it can be rapid because the technology is free and it\u2019s continuously being updated by developers.\n\nRed Hat has been able to leverage its technology to create an extensive platform that enables a hybrid cloud environment. Because of security, privacy and regulatory concerns, larger companies need to combine different, i.e. hybrid, options when it comes to the cloud. For example, they can utilize a mix of private and public clouds. Among the companies that provide public cloud infrastructure are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and MSFT. As a result of this need for flexibility, the flexibility of the open-source model, for the most part, has proven to be spot-on.\n\nAs part of IBM, Red Hat will benefit from the tech giant\u2019s tremendous distribution capabilities. What\u2019s more, the cloud opportunity is still massive. IBM believes that the typical enterprise has only transitioned 20% of its data to the cloud.\n\nHere\u2019s what the Senior Vice President and Chief Analyst of research firm IDC , Frank Gens, said about the acquisition of Red Hat: \u201cAs organizations seek to increase their pace of innovation to stay competitive, they are looking to open source and a distributed cloud environment to enable a new wave of digital innovation that wasn\u2019t possible before. Over the next five years, IDC expects enterprises to invest heavily in their journeys to the cloud, and innovation on it. A large and increasing portion of this investment will be on open hybrid and multicloud environments that enable them to move apps, data and workloads across different environments.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the deal has the potential to generate growth for IBM and should help make Big Blue a major player in cloud computing. That should definitely be positive for IBM stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line On International Business Machines Stock\n\nI can understand why there is lots of skepticism regarding the bull case on IBM stock. Consider that, over the past five years, IBM stock price has fallen 2%.", "description": "Enterprise software has been one of the most notable bright spots in the tech world.
