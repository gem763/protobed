They are ambitious targets that would be consistent with Netflix's early progress, and in the mid-range of Disney+, Disney's Netflix rival, set to launch on Nov. 12.\n\nWarnerMedia hopes this service will get a boost in 2021 when it launches an advertising-supported option at a lower cost, insiders said.\n\nAfter it launches the ad-supported option, the company will add live programming on HBO Max.\n\nA long-term goal for HBO Max is to help AT&T retain wireless subscribers, according to executives, and also allow the company to pair wireless and DirecTV satellite data to learn more about consumers \u2014 and in turn, charge higher rates to advertisers.\n\nAs one of the final entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max faces a tough competitive landscape. Although the Warner Brothers archive includes thousands of films and TV series like \"The Shining\" and \"Scooby-Doo,\" it does not have the same brand awareness as Disney properties like Pixar or Marvel.\n\nPrice could also be an obstacle: HBO Max is likely to cost slightly more than the $14.99 the company charges for HBO \u2014 significantly more than competing services from Apple ($4.99) and Disney ($6.99), and slightly higher than the standard $12.99 Netflix plan.\n\nSelling HBO Max by piggybacking off the entrenched HBO service has its own challenges. Stankey wants to convert HBO's 35 million U.S. subscriber base, which includes the 10 million customers AT&T controls, to HBO Max. Doing so involves renegotiating deals with current pay TV providers, who may be wary of helping AT&T snatch their video customers.\n\nAnd while AT&T executives believe that HBO Max could reduce churn on its cell phone business to boost profits, the link may not be that clear.\n\n\"AT&T hasn't seen any more improvement (in churn) with wireless/video bundling than Verizon has seen without it,\" said MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett.", "description": "As one of the final entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max faces a tough competitive landscape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105857435-1555517393602f81c60e82f01489e0894317f257c25bebcd22db3f1bef6d41aa07cffed6534a48625739d6bc4aaa4c131258f54ba17df.jpg?v=1555517494", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
