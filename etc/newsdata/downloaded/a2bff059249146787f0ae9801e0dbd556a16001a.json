And yes, t\u2019is a delightfully unsettling trailer.\n\nThe End Of The F***ing World, based on the award-winning graphic novel by Charles Forsman, tells the tale of teens James (Alex Lawther) and Alyssa (Jessica Barden) as they set out in search of Alyssa\u2019s dad, who left home when she was just a wee bub.\n\nAlso, James is kind of a psychopath who\u2019s bored of killing cats and birds. And, Alyssa is supposed to be his first human vicim, except they catch feelings for each other instead. It\u2019s very normal content.\n\nSeason 2\u2019s trailer picks up right where season 1 dropped off\u2026 with us wondering whether or not James is indeed dead. We don\u2019t actually find out though. Instead, we cop a lot of Alyssa on her own\u2026 plus a wedding that is not at all troubling. We also get a lovely first look at new character Bonnie, played by Naomi Ackie (Lady Macbeth). Bonnie is described as an outsider with a troubled past and a mysterious connection to Alyssa.\n\nThe End Of The F***ing World season 2 hits Netflix, November 5.\n\nOnce again, no James. Well, except for that, uh, bloody bit. I refuse to believe he\u2019s dead.\n\nSeason 1 came out October 24, 2017, so I wouldn\u2019t blame you for re-binging the first season. Netflix will probably drop a lil\u2019 recap video before the premiere too. One will definitely auto-play once you load up season 2.", "description": "The big guns at Netflix have unleashed the trailer for\u00a0The End Of The F***ing World\u00a0season 2.
