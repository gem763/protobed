In this case, the judges ruled that Trump\u2019s arguments \u2014 that the subpoenas were invalid because Congress lacked a \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d for its subpoenas \u2014 were incorrect.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cContrary to the President\u2019s arguments, the Committee possesses authority under both the House Rules and the Constitution to issue the subpoena, and Mazars must comply,\u201d Judges David S. Tatel and Patricia A. Millett wrote for the court. Both were appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nAD\n\nThe president was appealing a lower court\u2019s decision that allowed the House Oversight Committee to move forward with its request for financial statements and audits prepared for Trump and his companies by the accounting firm Mazars USA.\n\nThe House sought these records months before the beginning of its recent impeachment inquiry, related to Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nThis case, instead, was prompted by testimony from Trump\u2019s former \u201cfixer,\u201d attorney Michael Cohen, that Trump had exaggerated his wealth to seek loans.\n\nAfterward, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) celebrated the ruling. In a letter to fellow House Democrats, Pelosi called it \u201ca major victory\u201d \u2014 and a sign their efforts to investigate Trump are gaining traction.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis week, we have seen increased outside validation of our efforts to hold the President accountable and these statements speak to the heart of the Constitutional challenge that we face,\u201d Pelosi wrote.\n\nThe dissenting judge in Friday\u2019s ruling, Neomi Rao \u2014 appointed by Trump \u2014 said that if the House wants to investigate possible wrongdoing by the president, it should do so by invoking its constitutional impeachment powers, not its regular oversight powers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThroughout our history, Congress, the President, and the courts have insisted upon maintaining the separation between the legislative and impeachment powers of the House and recognized the gravity and accountability that follow impeachment,\u201d Rao said. \u201cAllowing the Committee to issue this subpoena for legislative purposes would turn Congress into a roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn her dissent \u2014 which could provide a road map for other conservatives, including on the Supreme Court \u2014 Rao said Congress has the power to investigate private individuals. But, she said, that power did not extend to the president in the same way because the Constitution has created impeachment as a mechanism to investigate him.\n\nAllowing Congress to act otherwise disrupts the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, Rao said, permitting it \u201cto expand its control over the other branches.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt is unclear what will happen next in this case, but Trump seems likely to appeal \u2014 either to the full D.C. Circuit or to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWhile we are reviewing the court\u2019s lengthy decision, as well as Judge Rao\u2019s dissent, we continue to believe that this subpoena is not a legitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative authority,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, one of Trump\u2019s private attorneys, in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyer in the case, William Consovoy, declined to comment on the ruling or the legal team\u2019s next steps.\n\nAs part of the appeals process, House Democrats agreed with the president\u2019s private legal team to suspend deadlines set by the subpoena for turning over the records while the court case is pending. The timeline allows the case to move swiftly by court standards and could set up a potential ruling from the Supreme Court in the midst of the presidential campaign.\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for Mazars said the firm stood by its previous statement about the case: Mazars USA will \u201crespect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for the House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nIn the 66-page opinion written by Tatel, the majority found that the Mazars subpoena fit squarely in a long history of cases in which courts recognized Congress\u2019s broad authority to conduct its constitutional and legislative duties without interference from the other branches.\n\nAD\n\nLike Congress had in the Teapot Dome and other presidential scandals, the House \u201cOversight Committee has expressed an interest in determining whether and how illegal conduct has occurred,\u201d Tatel wrote. \u201cEven more so,\u201d he said, \u201cthe House has even put its legislation where its mouth is,\u201d passing one bill to address problems it is investigating and proposing others.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhether current financial disclosure laws are successfully eliciting the right information from the sitting President, occupant of the highest elected office in the land, is undoubtedly \u2018a matter of concern to the United States,\u2019 \u201d Tatel said, citing a past court opinion. He added, \u201cIt is not at all suspicious that the Committee would focus an investigation into presidential financial disclosures on the accuracy and sufficiency of the sitting President\u2019s filings.\u201d\n\nIn a separate case in New York, the president is trying to block Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance (D) from subpoenaing Trump\u2019s tax records from the accounting firm. Vance is investigating hush-money payments made just before the 2016 election to two women who said they had affairs with Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAt the appeals court in Washington, Trump\u2019s attorneys argued that the subpoena was invalid without specific authorization from the full House and was an unconstitutional attempt to harass the president because it lacked a legitimate legislative purpose. The Justice Department echoed those arguments in a separate filing.\n\nAD\n\nDouglas N. Letter, the House\u2019s general counsel, had said in court that Congress has a legitimate interest in investigating the president\u2019s possible conflicts of interest and potential misconduct. He noted that the House subpoena followed committee testimony from Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Cohen that the president intentionally inflated and deflated the value of his assets to bankers and insurers for personal gain.\n\nIn the opinion Friday, the court disagreed with Trump\u2019s attorneys, who contended that the House subpoena served no legitimate legislative purpose because any financial disclosure laws unconstitutionally \u201c\u2018impinge on and hence interfere with the independence that is imperative\u201d to the presidency.\n\nAD\n\nTatel and Millett said the proper question is whether any law for which the subpoena could be useful \u201cprevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions,\u201d to which they said the answer was plainly no, citing other laws regarding presidential finances.\n\nAD\n\nThey noted federal law already requires presidents to report gifts they receive and bars them and other federal employees from using inside information to profit on stock trades. The same Constitution that directs the president to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u201d also prohibits him from receiving \u201cany \u2026 Emolument\u201d from foreign governments without Congress\u2019s approval, as well as from the federal or state governments other than a fixed \u201cCompensation\u201d \u201cfor his Services.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the President may accept no domestic emoluments and must seek Congress\u2019s permission before accepting any foreign emoluments, then surely a statute facilitating the disclosure of such payments lies within constitutional limits,\u201d they said.\n\nAD\n\nAnd, Tatel and Miller said pointedly that while Reo claimed to base her dissent in the \u201ctext and structure of the Constitution\u201d and \u201coriginal meaning,\u201d she ignored \u201cnearly a century of precedent\u201d resolving disputes between Congress and the president while respecting \u201cthe co-equal status and roles of both the legislative and executive branches,\u201d and protecting each\u2019s prerogatives.\n\nThe appeals court was reviewing an expedited decision from U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta, who pointed to decades of legal precedent upholding Congress\u2019s right to investigate. The circuit panel heard arguments in a rare July session, keeping the case on a fast track.\n\n\u201cIt is simply not fathomable,\u201d Mehta wrote, \u201cthat a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct \u2014 past or present \u2014 even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.\u201d", "description": "The 2-to-1 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
