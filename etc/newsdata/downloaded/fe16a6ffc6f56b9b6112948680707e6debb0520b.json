REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Thursday on his main rival, former general Benny Gantz, to join him in a broad, governing coalition after Israel\u2019s election ended with no clear winner.\n\nA spokeswoman for Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White party, had no immediate response to the surprise offer from Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party.\n\nThe change of strategy reflected Netanyahu\u2019s weakened position after he failed again in Tuesday\u2019s election, which followed an inconclusive ballot in April, to secure a parliamentary majority.\n\n\u201cDuring the election campaign, I called for the establishment of a right-wing government but to my regret, the election results show that this is impossible,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\n\u201cBenny, we must set up a broad unity government, as soon as today. The nation expects us, both of us, to demonstrate responsibility and that we pursue cooperation.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Gantz said he hoped for a \u201cgood, desirable unity government\u201d. But he has also ruled out forming one with a Netanyahu-led Likud, citing looming corruption charges against the prime minister. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.\n\n(This story has been refiled to add dropped word in paragraph 1).", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Thursday on his main rival, former general Benny Gantz, to join him in a broad, governing coalition after Israel's election ended with no clear winner.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431526235&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0GY", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
