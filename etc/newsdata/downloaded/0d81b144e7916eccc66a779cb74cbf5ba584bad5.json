Schmidt denied taking any banned substance and the team backed him.\n\n\u201cIn one instance we had a player \u2026 had a substance that entered his body, it was a testable amount. We were convinced by all the evidence that we had that it was accidental or involuntary,\u201d McPhee said.\n\n\u201cAnd the second, a player knowingly took substances without our consent or recommendation, and he tested positive. We\u2019re supportive of our players, but they\u2019re completely different circumstances. One we defended vigorously, the other it\u2019s pretty black and white.\u201d\n\nZykov has six goals and nine assists in 47 career NHL games for Vegas, Edmonton and Carolina.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Vegas Golden Knights winger Valentin Zykov has been suspended 20 games without pay by the National Hockey League for a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/834cb8_vegas-golden-knights-winger-valentin-zykov-was-issued-20-game-ban-by-nhl-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
