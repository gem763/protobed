Do you now want to vote him again as BDP or BPF? As for me, I want him at BPF,\u201d Khama said in a video he shared on Facebook.\n\nHe was addressing a gathering in Serowe West about two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThere was a time they wanted to get rid of Tshekedi as a minister, but they were warned that such a move will cost them votes in his constituency. Now he is being paraded at BDP gatherings to show people that he is still there even after I left for BPF.\u201d\n\nBPF president, Biggie Butale, told City Press this week that they were also in support of Tshekedi joining them.\n\n\u201cWe are much interested to have Tshekedi, and his constituency in Serowe West wants him to join us,\u201d he said.\n\nButale was worried though that time was not on their side to convince Tshekedi to join them.\n\n\u201cThe deadline and cut-off date with the elections commission is September 26. We hope we do not reach that point and he is still not with us but the last thing we want is to divide the royal family.\u201d\n\nTough decision for Tshekedi Khama\n\nTshekedi has generally been evasive on the matter and was heard saying on a social media video when a journalist asked him about his brother\u2019s bid to recruit him to the new party: \u201cThat\u2019s what he is saying, that\u2019s what he is saying\u201d.\n\nHe did not respond to questions sent to him by City Press on the same subject.\n\nWhile those who want him with BPF have only four days, posters were already out announcing that Tshekedi will be launched as a BDP member of parliament candidate for Serowe West this coming Saturday.\n\nWill Tshekedi remain loyal and stay with his father\u2019s party or will he join his brother at BPF?\n\nA political analyst in Botswana, Professor Zibani Maundeni, does not see the latter happening, saying it has got nothing to do with blood.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Tshekedi will go to BPF. One reason is that he does not like people around Ian Khama \u2026 he doesn\u2019t like his brother\u2019s associates,\u201d Maundeni said.\n\nKhama legacy and toughest elections for BDP\n\nBotswana is synonymous with Khama, the name of its first president and if the BDP loses power this will come with a dent to the Khama legacy.\n\nKhama\u2019s BPF is now in bed with Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), formerly Khama\u2019s biggest critic as an opposition party during his presidency. \u201cThe BPF is on its own but we were brought together by our common agenda which is to unseat BDP,\u201d said UDC spokesperson, Moeti Mohwasa.\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Maundeni sees Khama\u2019s departure from BDP as a huge blow for the governing party.\n\n\u201cKhama took a chunk of supporters away with him especially those from Central District where he comes from and is a chief. BDP is likely to suffer defeat in Central District as a result if people there express loyalty to Khama when they vote,\u201d he said.\n\nButale was also seemingly banking on the same notion.\n\n\u201cBDP won\u2019t be able to get 29+ seats needed for outright power. They won 35 seats in the last elections and 12 of those seats were from Central District which is where Khama comes from and where we\u2019re hoping for 17 to 18 seats out of 19 there,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, another party \u2013 Alliance for Progressives (AP) \u2013 was also hopeful of claiming parliamentary seats in the total of 57 constituencies countrywide.\n\n\u201cInternal strife in BDP and other parties have delayed them and while they squabbled, we were busy working on the ground. We\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to perform well in the elections,\u201d said AP spokesperson, Phenyo Butale.", "description": "The proverb \u201cblood is thicker than water\u201d could be in for a tough test with two politicians who are the sons of Botswana\u2019s first president, Seretse Khama, approaching elections from opposite political sides.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8946/1c0e6996d148475aa1e0a775c79fdd7a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
