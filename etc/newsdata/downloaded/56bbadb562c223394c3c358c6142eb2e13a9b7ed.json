It was the weakest growth since China started reporting data by quarters in 1993.\n\nThe slump adds to problems faced by Chinese leaders, including rising inflation and weaker consumer demand, as they fight a tariff war with President Donald Trump over Beijing\u2019s trade surplus and technology ambitions.\n\n\u201cPressure on economic activity should intensify in the coming months,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.\n\nAsian stock markets declined on the news. China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng shed 0.2%.\n\nThe unexpectedly weak data raise the likelihood of interest rate cuts and other stimulus to shore up growth and avert politically dangerous job losses. Chinese leaders have boosted government spending but avoided a large-scale stimulus until now for fear of reigniting a rise in debt that already is so high that rating agencies cut Beijing\u2019s credit rating.\n\n\u201cMore aggressive stimulus can be expected,\u201d said Bill Adams of PNC Financial Services Group in a report.\n\nThe slowdown in China, the world\u2019s biggest trader, has global repercussions. It is depressing demand for industrial components from Asian countries. Prices of soybeans, iron ore and other commodities have fallen, hitting Brazil, Australia and other suppliers.\n\nConsumer prices have spiked due to a disease outbreak in China\u2019s vast pig herds that is disrupting pork supplies.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund cited the U.S.-Chinese tariff war in this week\u2019s decision to cut its 2019 global economic growth forecast to 3% from 3.2%.\n\nTrump agreed last week to delay a tariff hike on Chinese goods and said Beijing promised to buy up to $50 billion of American farm goods. Officials say the two sides still are working out details.\n\nBeijing has yet to confirm the scale of possible purchases. It is unclear whether Chinese leaders want more steps including lifting punitive tariffs already in place before purchases go ahead.\n\nBeijing is resisting U.S. pressure to roll back plans for government-led creation of Chinese global competitors in robotics and other technology. Washington, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say those violate Beijing\u2019s market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring companies to hand over technology.\n\nA bigger impact on Chinese growth appears to come from cooling domestic activity including consumer spending and investment.\n\nRetail sales growth declined to 8.2% over a year earlier in the first three quarters of 2019, down from the first half\u2019s 8.4%, the National Bureau of Statistics reported.\n\nAuto sales in China, the global industry\u2019s biggest market, are off 11.7% for the first nine months of the year.\n\nThat is a setback for a marathon official campaign to nurture growth based on domestic consumption and reduce reliance on trade and investment. Those plans call for maintaining exports that support millions of jobs.\n\nFactory output growth slowed to 5.6% in the January-September period, down from 6% in the first six months of the year.\n\nGrowth in investment in factories, real estate and other fixed assets slowed to 5.4% for the first three quarters of 2019 from 5.5% in the first eight months of the year.\n\nInvestment \u201cis being held back by trade war uncertainties,\u201d said Adams of PNC.\n\nChina\u2019s exports to the United States, its biggest foreign market, fell 21.9% in September from a year ago. That helped to drag down overall Chinese exports by 1.4%. Imports of American goods sank 15.7%.\n\nBeijing is struggling to cool consumer inflation that has spiked due to an outbreak of African swine fever that has disrupted supplies of pork, China\u2019s staple meat.\n\nConsumer prices rose 3% in September, the ruling Communist Party\u2019s official target for the year, as pork prices soared 69.3% over a year earlier.\n\nAfrican swine fever has killed or prompted authorities to destroy millions of pigs. Beijing has increased imports, released pork from stockpiles and promised aid to farmers. But researchers say shortages are likely to last through next year while farmer rebuild their herds.\n\n______\n\nNational Bureau of Statistics: www.stats.gov.cn\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "China's economic growth sank to a 26-year low in the latest quarter amid pressure from a trade war with Washington, adding to a deepening slump that is weighing on global growth.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/china-economy_98817_c0-208-5000-3124_s1200x700.jpg?74d48b7b24509088c15947da9892024c1a07cb57", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
