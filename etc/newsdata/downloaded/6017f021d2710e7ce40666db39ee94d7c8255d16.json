No further details were given. PSA Peugeot put out a similar statement.\n\nFCA shares shot up nearly 9% on the news to 12.75 euros ($14.70) in Milan trading.\n\nFiat Chrysler has long been looking for a partner to help shoulder investments in the capital-heavy industry, under the outlook that failure to consolidate would inevitably lead some companies to fail.\n\nThe company's U.S. headquarters is based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, the historic home of the Chrysler brand, which it rescued in tandem with a federal bailout deal in 2009. Fiat Chrysler owns multiple brands, including its namesake brands, Jeep, Dodge and Ram.\n\nTalks this year with another French carmaker, Renault, to create what would have been the third-largest carmaker broke down over French government concerns about the role of the Japanese partner Nissan and criticisms from Renault\u2019s leading union.\n\nLike Renault, PSA is partly owned by the French government, which will put a priority on protecting jobs in French plants.\n\nPeugeot family group, China\u2019s Dongfeng Motors, and French state investment bank BPI France each have 12.23% of capital and 19.5% voting rights.\n\nFiat hoped to spark small-car revival:Instead, SUVs soared\n\nSergio Marchionne dead:5 ways he saved Chrysler\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles was formed in 2014 out of a merger of Italian carmaker Fiat and the American company Chrysler, which Fiat brought back from the brink of bankruptcy. It is controlled by the Fiat-founding Agnelli family, represented in FCA by chairman John Elkann who spearheaded the Renault talks. His role in these talks has not been disclosed.\n\nFiat Chrysler has a larger global footprint that PSA Peugeot, whose focus is on Europe where it is the second-largest carmaker. Fiat Chrysler last year sold 5.8 million cars globally but it makes the lion\u2019s share of its profits in the United States and has been struggling in Asia and Europe. PSA sold 3.9 million cars last year.\n\nFiat Chrysler is making a concerted push into electric and hybrid vehicles, where it has lagged, focusing in particular on its premium brands Alfa Romeo and Maserati.\n\nPSA has performed a remarkable turnaround in recent years, going from one of the industry\u2019s sicker car companies to one of its more powerful. That\u2019s notably thanks to an unusual $4.1 billion bailout in 2014 in which Dongfeng and the French state gained equal shares to the family that founded Peugeot 200 years ago.\n\nIn 2017, PSA bought General Motors\u2019 Opel and Vauxhall brands for $2.33 billion, making it Europe\u2019s No. 2 automaker after Volkswagen.\n\nPSA is now planning to reintroduce Peugeot cars to North American markets as part of a plan that includes a car sharing service introduced in Washington last year.\n\nAngela Charlton reported from Paris.", "description": "Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles on Wednesday confirmed that it is in talks with French rival PSA Peugeot.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7e482a443740f52337eba28dff4794963c9ca5ad/c=0-307-2996-2000/local/-/media/2018/06/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636658590854781009-01.jpg?width=2996&height=1693&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
