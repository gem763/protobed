The woman said she had been raped by a friend of her ex-boyfriend, but the details were fuzzy because she was drunk at the time. She said she didn\u2019t want to press charges but allowed officers to look through her phone.\n\nPolice interpreted text messages as an acknowledgement that the sex was consensual, according to court records. Branson said the woman fabricated being raped out of regret and to get revenge.\n\nHowever, the woman\u2019s attorneys argued in court documents that she is innocent and that her text messages made light of what happened because she wasn\u2019t yet able to admit she had been raped after waking up in a strange bed with no memory of how she got there with unexplained bruises on her legs, neck and arms.\n\nThey said police decided to investigate her rather than the man whom she alleged attacked her. The man, who also was a university student, was never charged.\n\nThe woman\u2019s legal fees were covered in part by the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, an organization founded by celebrities during the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe police investigation began in October 2018 after the student asked for a detective to be present when she made a formal statement to Title IX investigators at the university, according to testimony from a motions hearing.\n\nThe student ultimately decided not to meet with the university, and her attorneys said she never told officers she wanted to pursue charges, though she did say she might consider it at some point.\n\nPatrick Compton, a Lawrence police spokesman, said police have the latitude to determine whether to proceed with a case even if the reporting party declines to press charges.\n\nBranson said he planned to work with police to update his office\u2019s guidelines for investigating and prosecuting sexually violent crimes. Law enforcement will provide multiple options for \u201csurvivors to report crimes on their terms\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Star did not name the woman because she says she is the victim of a sexual assault and the paper has a policy of not naming sexual assault victims. The felony false reporting charge carried a maximum sentence of up to 23 months in prison.", "description": "Three felony counts dropped over concerns case could discourage survivors from reporting their attack, district attorney said", "authors": ["Associated Press In Lawrence"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa9fe57c0e4a2796d4963377ce50911235758112/0_102_4218_2530/master/4218.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d5d2884e94438c9310ba9d5a383d9c6f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
