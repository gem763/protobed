Subaru said the engine computers in the models can continue to power the ignition coil after motors are shut off. That can cause a short circuit and a blown fuse.\n\nSubaru said car dealerships will update the software and replace the coils and front exhaust pipes if needed.\n\nThe second recall covers 205,000 vehicles in 2017 to 2019 models of Impreza cars, as well as the 2018 Crosstrek SUVs. The automaker said the aluminum positive crankcase ventilation valves can fall apart, potentially causing debris to fall into the engine and cause a power loss.\n\nSubaru owners can get dealers to replace valves if needed. If a valve has separated and parts can't be found, engines will be replaced.\n\nBoth recalls start December 13.\n\nIn March, Subaru recalled 1.3 million vehicles in the U.S. because of potentially faulty brake lights. That recall covered certain 2014 to 2016 Forester, 2008 through 2016 Impreza and 2013 through 2017 Crosstrek vehicles.", "description": "Japanese automaker is recalling recent Impreza and Crosstrek models in the U.S. because of separate problems", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/02/3915c8ee-0d5f-49a0-945c-113d1378c25d/thumbnail/1200x630/13aa9e2dbf2244b93a4d60723b0b58f8/gettyimages-73814483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
