Here's how the restaurant chain turned around.", "language": "en", "text": "Applebee\u2019s rose to popularity in the 1990s thanks to its affordable menu and popular items like buffalo chicken wings.\n\nBut after the 2008 recession, it had a hard time drawing diners back. Applebee\u2019s tried to reinvent itself to appeal to millennial diners, but ended up alienating its core customers.\n\nThanks to the Dollarita and going back to basics, 2018 sparked a comeback for the beleaguered chain. Applebee\u2019s sales climbed 5.5% in the first nine months of 2018.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\n\nIrene Kim: By the end of 2017, it seemed like the end for Applebee\u2019s. The company had just closed 99 locations, with plans to close up to 80 more. And this was just the end of a struggle that Applebee\u2019s had been fighting for years. But then something unexpected happened: Applebee\u2019s made a comeback. Sales went up 5.5% in the first nine months of 2018. After falling nearly 8% just a year before. It looks like people are once again\n\nCommercial: Eatin\u2019 good in the neighbourhood.\n\nKim: So, what happened?\n\nBill and TJ Palmer opened the first Applebee\u2019s in 1980. Three years later, they sold the restaurant concept to WR Grace and Company, and it quickly blew up.\n\nBy 1994, there were more than 500 Applebee\u2019s locations across the US. And just four years later, in 1998, the company opened its 1,000th restaurant, rivaling competitors\u2019 store locations, like IHOP, with 800, and Denny\u2019s, with more than 1,000 stores nationwide.\n\nKate Taylor: Applebee\u2019s was really doing well because they were reliable. They weren\u2019t too fancy, they weren\u2019t too cheap, but they hit a nice sweet spot in the middle for people.\n\nKim: Dishes like Applebee\u2019s boneless buffalo wings became a fan favourite, and promotions like half-priced appetizers made Applebee\u2019s a popular spot for customers looking for a good deal. But then, at the end of 2007, the recession happened, and people stopped eating out as much.\n\nKatie Couric: We are in a recession.\n\nNews anchor: The longest recession since World War II.\n\nCouric: But the question now: When will it end?\n\nKim: As Applebee\u2019s sales struggled in the post-recession economy, it attempted to reinvent itself as a modern bar and grill to draw in up-and-coming millennials.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t work.\n\nTaylor: Applebee\u2019s tried to be a little bit trendy, a little bit cool. And it just came off as kind of corny for most people, where it felt like they were trying too hard to win over millennials.\n\nKim: New menu items like hand-cut $US20 steaks and brisket nachos not only failed to bring in new millennial diners; they alienated the very customers who had made Applebee\u2019s successful in the first place: People looking for a reliable, affordable meal out.\n\nBy 2015, Applebee\u2019s sales were falling. And only continued to fall, year after year. In 2017, the company closed 99 locations and announced plans to close 60 to 80 more the following year.\n\nJulia Stewart, the CEO of Applebee\u2019s parent company, Dine Brands Global, reportedly stepped down because of Applebee\u2019s poor performance. The former waitress was one of the industry\u2019s most celebrated and longest-serving executives.\n\nFor a brief time, it looked like Applebee\u2019s was done for.\n\nBut instead of folding, it turned things around.\n\nTaylor: Starting in late 2017, 2018, Applebee\u2019s parent company, Dine Brands, had new leadership come in, and this new leadership was very, very focused on being inexpensive and not trying to be too trendy.\n\nBasically, they took Applebee\u2019s back to the basics.\n\nThey\u2019re not gonna try and win over millennials with these fancy new menu items. They\u2019re gonna find something that\u2019s inexpensive that people are proven to like. The biggest thing that kind of kicked off the turnaround for Applebee\u2019s was the Dollarita, the $US1 margarita.\n\nKim: After the success of the Dollarita, Applebee\u2019s quickly launched its Neighbourhood Drink program, releasing a new $US1 to $US3 drink every month. And that move has paid off. Alcohol now accounts for 15% of Applebee\u2019s business.\n\nJohn Cywinski: We\u2019ve sold more than 55 million Neighbourhood Drinks at Applebee\u2019s since we launched this program in October of 2017.\n\nKim: And although overall revenue hasn\u2019t quite caught up, the company is going pretty strong.\n\nCywinski: 2018 was the best year that Applebee\u2019s had in the past 25 years. We\u2019re very proud of that.\n\nWhen I think about Applebee\u2019s, we are, in many respects, America\u2019s kitchen table. We\u2019ve got 1,700 locations, and we very much believe \u201ceatin\u2019 good in neighbourhood\u201d embodies who we are and America resonates or connects with our brand.\n\nKim: But will Applebee\u2019s be able to keep up the momentum?\n\nTaylor: Applebee\u2019s has lost momentum a little bit so far in 2019. It\u2019s hard because they had such a good year last year. It\u2019s hard to keep that going.\n\nMillennials, they figured it out. They want, honestly, the same thing every generation wants: good prices, cheap drinks.\n\nThey need to kind of figure out if there\u2019s anything different that they need to do for Gen Z.\n\nKim: What do you think of the new Applebee\u2019s?
