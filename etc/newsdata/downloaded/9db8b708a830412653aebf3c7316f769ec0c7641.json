My news director had never once commented on my hair.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hamblin, in the television industry, there is a bias towards hairstyles customarily worn by white women and a consistent aesthetic so viewers can trust a familiar face. \u201cThat\u2019s hard when you have bigger, coarser hair,\u201d she tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nView photos Brianna Hamblin, a reporter at CBS19, decided to wear her natural hair on camera. (Photo: CBS19 News) More\n\nIn the past, Hamblin had straightened her hair or had worn wigs and weaves \u2014 styles that were time-consuming, costly on an entry-level salary, and required regular upkeep. For example, Hamblin got her hair professionally braided before wigs were able to fit onto her head. And the prep was inconvenient \u2014 Hamblin traveled to crime scenes and sporting events in humid and rainy weather, either fastening her hair into a last-minute ponytail or dashing into the nearest fast-food restaurant with a hair straightener, which she kept in her purse.\n\n\u201cDuring the summer, I knew I needed a new wig, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to pay for it,\u201d Hamblin tells Yahoo Lifestyle. So, in September, she asked her boss for permission to look natural, a request he immediately approved with enthusiasm.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Hamblin revealed her curls in several Facebook selfies. \u201c...So to make my on air hair journey complete I had to build up the courage to try my natural hair,\u201d she wrote in a post. \u201cMy coworkers and everyone have been so encouraging telling me they love it and I\u2019m so grateful to live and work in a community open to something a lot of the country is still against... That being said, there is nothing easy about my natural hair lol. I love it, but one unexpected rain during a Live shot and I\u2019m done for. Enjoying it on the weekend and vacations might be what\u2019s best for me.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m still figuring it out, but, I would never be able to come to a conclusion and truly figured out what works for me if I never tried. So to any curly haired reporters out there reading this, if you have a news director as great as mine, don\u2019t be afraid to try everything to truly find your look! If you\u2019re at your first market, do it now so you can be completely confident in how you will present yourself throughout the rest of your career!\u201d\n\nHamblin tells Yahoo Lifestyle: \u201cI was nervous how I would be perceived on television, especially in a smaller market. But I haven\u2019t received any hate mail.\u201d\n\nShe says a Facebook group called Curly Girls On-Air inspired her to be herself at work, and coworkers and viewers rave about her look. Facebook commenters wrote, \u201cI'm sorry this is even an issue. Of course you look perfect!\u201d and \u201cYou are so stunning, no matter what hairstyle you rock!\u201d\n\n\u201cNewsrooms need diversity because the people watching are diverse,\u201d Hamblin tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe need to redefine what looks \u2018professional\u2019 so little girls with natural hair realize it.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Brianna Hamblin, a reporter at CBS19, says it took courage to wear her natural hair on television.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CRY3X3P17iku4WaM0vhjWg--~B/aD05NjA7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/dca54db0-f69d-11e9-bc5b-646a3e5191e6", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
