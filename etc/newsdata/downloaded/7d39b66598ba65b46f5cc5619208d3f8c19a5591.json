This is the theory behind our Cash Cars series and in this column we look at the Jaguar XJR.\n\nJaguar\u2019s supercharged luxe-express might not be the unreliable money-pit you think it is, reckons Tony Middlehurst, and a smasher could be yours from about \u00a36,000.\n\nSupercar performance, limousine luxury and superb handling, Jaguar's XJR won rave reviews and has a cult following, surely that spells future classic?\n\nAs some of you may know, Uncle Bob is our in-house expert at picking out motoring\u2019s slow depreciators.\n\nIf you met him in the street (or perhaps more accurately on the street, outside a pub) and you had to guess what car he drove, you might very well plump for the Jaguar XJ.\n\nThat would be a very good guess. Bob is both a big fan and a serial owner of old-school Jag saloons, and of the XJR in particular. In his view, nothing beats them for lowering the heartrate when beating a hasty retreat from angry bookmakers.\n\nAnd right now, in terms of affordable performance and luxury, not much else beats a 400bhp XJR starting at about \u00a36,000 for value.\n\nWhat is the the XJR\u2019s power secret?\n\nSupercharging. In the last forty years of so, turbocharging has morphed from a scary performance add-on into an everyday way of adding power to titchy engines. Supercharging, in Bob\u2019s non-PC view, is a far more manly means of achieving big power.\n\nFor him, the whine of a steel compressor mechanically forcing air into a large-capacity engine is one of life\u2019s great noises, in either classic aviation or modern motoring.\n\nYou can still get supercharged engines in the current X351-bodyshape XJ, but as far as Bob is concerned the association of this car with such people as, for example, the Prime Minister has killed off any appeal they may or may not have had.\n\nIf you really wanted to unleash your inner Clarkson, you could take your XJR to the track and spend the day doing this - then waft home\n\nNo, for Bob there are only two real XJRs: the AJ16 6-cylinder 326bhp X300 of 1994, and the V8 models that followed it from 1997.\n\nFirst, there was the 370bhp 4.0-litre V8 X308. Then, in 2003, the X308 became the X350 by throwing off its heavy old steel coat in exchange for a swish aluminium number.\n\nThe supercharged 4.0 V8 grew to a 4.2 with 400bhp, the equipment-stuffed walnut burl and leather cabin reached new heights of opulence, and the electronically controlled air suspension was so clever it would quietly turn itself on every 24 hours to level the car up.\n\nThe final combination made for a wonderfully luxurious car in the finest British tradition that could also do the 0-60mph dash in five seconds dead and cruise serenely at a computer-restricted top whack of 155mph along an autobahn, if you can find and get to one.\n\nEarlier steel-sprung XJs rode even more sumptuously than the later ones, but even though the marketing-driven imperative of \u2018handling\u2019 had added an edge of hardness to the X350 and to the bodykitted X358 of 2007 (the one with the vertical silver trim fillets on the trailing edges of the front wings), the XJR experience was never less than comfortable. Not to mention very bloody fast.\n\nOlder Jaguars have something of a reputation for being unreliable, that's undeserved reckons our Cash Cars columnist Tony Middlehurst\n\nNow, there is some negative public perception about XJs. They\u2019re unreliable, and everybody knows it. That sort of perception. But when we\u2019re talking about the later XJs, that\u2019s an unfair call. Granted, there was a time when you probably wouldn't have bet your dog\u2019s kennel, let alone your house, on an XJ\u2019s electrics.\n\nBut by the time the X350 and X358s were rolling off the line, everything had changed. In 2009, Jaguar came top of the luxury brands in the tough JD Power ownership satisfaction survey. Never buy into the myth that German brands have some sort of unique free pass when it comes to reliability. It simply isn\u2019t true.\n\nAnyway, back to the point: the 2003-on X350s and X358s were the last \u2018proper\u2019 XJRs to feature forced induction. They cost \u00a358,500 in 2003, but prices for them now start at a sorely tempting \u00a35,000 or even less, while with a bit of haggling just over \u00a36,000 should get you a good one, so they\u2019re the XJRs we\u2019re going to look at here.\n\nBesides, looking at them is a whole lot better than looking at Bob. Even he would admit that.\n\nThe interior of an XJR is a very pleasant place to pass a long journey, as driver or passenger\n\nThe Cash Cars verdict on the XJR\n\nIt may be that, in the not too distant future when we\u2019re all enjoying the effortless thrust of 400bhp electric cars, some of us will look back on the supercharged V8 XJR and wonder why we ever thought it was a good idea to rely on complicated, petrol-guzzling, hydrocarbon-belching engines to deliver the exact same experience.\n\nThose of us with a more romantic outlook on life are more likely to look back and regret that we never tried an XJR while we could \u2013 and at a time when they were absurdly cheap.\n\nThat time is now.\n\nJaguar XJR: Bob\u2019s three to think on\n\nPrices for the 2003 to 2007 X350 XJR run from \u00a35,000 for a well-used one with 120,000+ miles to \u00a313,000 for a low-miler with hardly any owners and all the documentation you can eat.\n\nGood examples of the visually refreshed 2007 to 2009 X358 will cost you between \u00a39,000 for a privately-owned car with a six-figure mileage to \u00a318,000 for the top billy specimens.\n\nEither model will deliver storming performance, reasonable cruising economy and wonderful road presence.\n\nHere are three tasty choices that Uncle Bob has identified. Get in quick before he nabs one (or all) of them.\n\nThis 85,000 mile XJR has had just two owners and seems well looked after at \u00a38,500\n\n2003, Jaguar XJR (X350), \u00a38,500\n\nAn 85,000-miler in Eastbourne Light Gold \u2013 sorry, Topaz \u2013 this lovely XJR won't come with its private plate which an Aston Martin owner might pay good money for, but with just two owners, a clean MOT pass in November and always-garaged \u2018no expense spared\u2019 maintenance (which presumably means a full service history), it looks practically new inside and out and should be a solid bet for a few years\u2019 worth of deluxe motoring.\n\nA full service history and long-term owner bodes well for this \u00a310,995 2008 XJR\n\n2008, Jaguar XJR (X358), \u00a310,995\n\nA beautiful example of the facelifted/bodykitted X358 in pearl grey metallic with ivory leather, this XJR failed its MOT in February on the classic corroded brake pipe problem that affects so many cars, not just XJRs and not just Jaguars. That was fixed for the retest that was done early in March 2019, and that had no advisories. Owner by the same person since (nearly) new, it comes with a full service history. It's done 112,000 miles. Smashing.\n\nA fully-loaded Super V8 with 118,000, a few cosmetic 'improvements' and extra points for being photographed next to a plane, yours for \u00a36,450\n\n2003, Jaguar Super V8 (X350), \u00a36,450\n\nThe Super V8 is a great outside-the-box stealth option. A \u00a370,000 car new, it had the same 400bhp output as the XJR but offered even more cabin luxury, especially for rear passengers who had lots of buttons to play with. From 2004 you could get a long-wheelbase Super V8, but the first 2003 models like this one were all regular wheelbase, making them a tidier drive on twisty roads and easier to park in multi-storeys. Basically, it\u2019s an even posher XJR. It only has a partial service history, but it\u2019s for the last five years rather than the first five. Uncle Bob calls that the best kind of partial service history.\n\nJaguar XJR: The Good Stuff\n\nAs someone else might say, POWERRRR. If 400bhp from the 2003-on XJRs isn\u2019t enough, though heaven knows why it shouldn't be on today\u2019s clogged roads, 450bhp-plus is quickly available via a remap, and a rampant 650bhp is possible if you\u2019re willing and financially able to upgrade the supercharger to a twin-screw version.\n\nBut an XJR isn\u2019t just about unlikely speed in a delicately sculpted body. It\u2019s also about aren\u2019t-I-lucky comfort, refinement and luxury.\n\nThe Super V8 topped the XJR on equipment, but that was the thick end of \u00a370,000 new. Really, when you set down all the requirements for a car of this type, the XJR doesn\u2019t just tick every box, it double-taps every box, wraps them in a body bag and buries them seventeen miles out of town.\n\nThe last of the old-style XJs, the X350 and X358 facelift cars still had a clear styling link to their relatives from years gone by\n\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned the X350 XJR\u2019s aluminium bodywork. Interestingly, if you\u2019re boring, Jaguar used things called self-piercing rivets to stitch it all together. The only trouble with that was the rivets were made of steel. Add moisture to the mix and the possibility exists of the sort of reaction you wouldn\u2019t have been hoping for when you bought your Jaguar, ie corrosion.\n\nNot rust, because as we all remember from our O-level Physics, aluminium doesn\u2019t rust. Unlike proper British rust, aluminium corrosion doesn\u2019t spread like wildfire through your car.\n\nPlus, if an X350 isn\u2019t showing signs of corrosion now, it has every chance of remaining so for the foreseeable future, all of which is why we\u2019re including this under the Good Stuff heading. But do keep an eye on the edges of panels like wheelarches, doors, bootlids, and sunroofs, and on the bits that are not made of aluminium, like the subframes, which are annoyingly made of steel.\n\nYou may notice a warning light coming up to tell you that your air suspension has failed. That\u2019s not Good Stuff, surely? Well, it\u2019s not necessarily Not So Good Stuff either, because warning lights don\u2019t always tell the truth.\n\nIn this case it may not mean that you have to book the car in for a ruinously expensive replacement of the airbags and pump, as a naughty Jaguar dealer might once have told you. It may simply be that the compressor hasn't managed to inflate the bags in the two minutes allowed by the car\u2019s suspension ECU. That can happen on a cold day or if the car has been left standing for a while.\n\nCash Cars Cars lose money. As a general rule that\u2019s true, with depreciation eating up thousands of pounds of the price you paid. However, it doesn\u2019t have to be the case. Savvy buyers can pick up cars that will not only retain their value, but could be sold for more down the line. In our new Cash Cars series we look for those that fit the bill, read more: Honda S2000: Sportscar heaven Audi A8: Luxury at a bargain price Mercedes SL: R129 about to shine\n\nWe\u2019ve all had our sluggish morning moments. It could be that all you need is a new air pump diaphragm, which is somewhat cheaper than a whole new suspension setup.\n\nBefore 2012, if your airbags did fail, you were definitely in for a massive bill from your Jaguar dealer, but in that year Bilstein made the original B4 Airmatic suspension modules (their name for a gas shock absorber) commercially available to owners.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot cheaper, but still steep at a few pence under \u00a3750 a corner. If you\u2019re happy with a recon unit you can cut that cost by around 50 per cent.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the biggest fears of XJR ownership spiked. Another would be the behaviour of the six-speed automatic transmission. Even when fit, it did garner a reputation for jerkiness off the line that was unbecoming of a car of this nature. The good news is that plugging the gearbox ECU into an appropriate laptop and giving it what\u2019s known as a \u2018reflash\u2019 \u2013 in layman\u2019s terms, overwriting the memory of a computer chip to make it do something different \u2013 will sort that out.\n\nNone of the engine-related issues that affected the earlier X308 V8s \u2013 like timing chain tensioners, water pumps, throttle bodies and Nikasil bore erosion \u2013 should worry you on the X350s.\n\nFinally, economy. What? Yes, you heard right, economy. Trundle along at the UK\u2019s commonly chosen (but remember over the limit) cruising speed of 80mph and you can expect to see 30mpg. Not bad, eh.\n\nThe aluminium bodied Jaguar XJs, such as this one, have a good reputation but some prefer the more slimline look of earlier cars\n\nJaguar XJR: The Not So Good Stuff\n\nThe limitations of the classic XJ bodystyle will become evident when your family is comfortably ensconced in the car and you lift the boot lid to insert their luggage. Or carrier bags, as their luggage will therafter be called.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that the boot is small as the fact that it\u2019s awkwardly shaped for larger items, like Granny\u2019s Zimmer frame or your Canyon bike.\n\nAt the other end of the XJR we have the bonnet. Beneath that, unless you find yourself buying from one of Uncle Bob\u2019s seedier associates, you should find the magnificent V8 engine.\n\nIf you see any wetness there, that could mean either that a pipe has popped off the coolant expansion tank or that an under-charger coolant pipe is leaking. A new one of those costs buttons, but the labour required to remove the supercharger hardware getting in the way of it unfortunately does not.\n\nThe auto transmission was rather vaingloriously set up as a \u2018sealed for life\u2019 proposition, indicating that no maintenance would ever be required, but as is the way of these things it all turned out to be not so much blue sky thinking as pie in the sky thinking.\n\nIn Jaguar\u2019s defence, they were not the only peddler of these snake-oil claims. You do need to change the transmission fluid, and methods have been devised to do that. If there\u2019s nothing on the paperwork to suggest it hasn\u2019t been renewed in the last 50,000 miles, you\u2019d be well advised to rectify matters.\n\nOne transmission foible that should by now have been sorted by a recall on all X350s was the tendency of early cars to suddenly switch into reverse while motoring smartly along in a forwards fashion. That would test the glue on your toupee.\n\nMake sure the battery is always in good condition, as a weak one can impact the car in many strange and undesirable ways.\n\nGo for the older XJR and you'll find what looks like a more dated interior with no sat nav etc, but skipping a sat nav that will feel out of date by now anyway is no big deal\n\nInside, the rapid evolution of infotainment technology means that the XJ\u2019s satnav now looks about as modern as a Path\u00e9 News feature. That\u2019s not the XJ\u2019s fault: it\u2019s the fault of manufacturers ramming satnavs into their dashes as a \u00a32,000 extra or, as here, as a partial justification for high new-car pricing, rather than allowing owners to fit their own much cheaper satnavs from the wider market.\n\nBut that olde-worlde satnav is also a metaphor for the XJ\u2019s biggest problem. Its looks.\n\nBob has zero difficulty with them, and hasn't since the first XJ glided smoothly onto our roads in 1968. For others, however, the XJ has always looked old. Unsurprising really, because that first 1960s XJ deliberately incorporated classic Jaguar styling notes from earlier still. One man\u2019s graceful is another man\u2019s obsolete.\n\nBetween the front and back of the XJR we have that lovely aluminium body. It\u2019s always best to try and avoid accidents, obviously, but that\u2019s especially true of the X350. Not because it\u2019s unsafe, far from it, but from a financial perspective even a little bump will be expensive to put right as bodywork repairs for aluminium demand different and pricier techniques.\n\nCosmetic paint bubbling can occur as a result of either the steel rivets thing or, if you enjoy conspiracy theories, too-thin lacquer from the factory. Maladies that affect many other cars, like fragile doorhandles, reluctant windows, sticking mirrors and soggy parking sensors, also affect X350s.\n\nUnder the body there should be some suspension components. We\u2019ve talked about this in the Good Stuff bit, but we do have to warn you that it can still go wrong, both in the hardware and the software. Aluminium or not, this is still a heavyish car at a piglet short of 1,800kg, so suspension parts will need monitoring and replacing when you start hearing funny noises. The air suspension compressor is not averse to giving up the ghost either. Recon units are about \u00a3200, or you can now get DIY rebuild kits for \u00a335.\n\nThen there is potential failure of the Body Processing Module, a pewter-hued box of electronics that (unsurprisingly) costs several hundred quid to buy new.\n\nHowever, many are available via the gentlemen of the scrapping trade for as little as \u00a310. You need to make sure it\u2019s the right one for your car, but still there\u2019s no guarantee that it will be any better than the one you\u2019ve already got unless you pay three figures for a tested one.\n\nThey don't make them like that anymore: Classic Jaguar looks combined with a legendary engine are sure to stand the price of XJRs in good stead in years to come\n\nIf you\u2019re looking at 2006-registered cars, make sure they\u2019ve had the factory recall done on leaky brake pipes, because if there\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t want on a 400bhp car it\u2019s non-functioning brakes. If you\u2019re looking at any XJR, look at the back brake pads as they dissolve pretty smartly.\n\nWhile you're down there, have a look at the suspension wishbone bushes. Unless you\u2019re a mechanic, and even if you are a mechanic, you\u2019re unlikely to be able to tell anything by doing that, because a knackered bush doesn\u2019t look that different to a good one. Just know that they\u2019ll probably need replacing if there\u2019s no mention on the service history of them having been renewed for a few years, and/or if you\u2019re hearing clonking.\n\nFor goodness sake make sure that the electronic parking brake works. Anyone who has been constantly cursed with this on a Land Rover Discovery 3 will know what a pain EPBs can be. In Bob\u2019s view this is a ridiculous idea that should never have seen the light of day.\n\nAs noted earlier, don\u2019t run off with the idea that German cars in this class are somehow vastly superior on the reliability front. Reputable surveys have shown that the contemporary Mercedes S-Class suffered from more expensive faults than the XJ.", "description": "Jaguar\u2019s supercharged luxe-express might not be the unreliable money-pit you think it is, reckons Tony Middlehurst, and a smasher could be yours from about \u00a36,000.", "authors": ["Tony Middlehurst For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
