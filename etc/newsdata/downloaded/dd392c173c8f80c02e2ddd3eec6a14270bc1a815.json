Embattled Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi and parliament speaker Mohammed Hal-Halbusi have both proposed a laundry list of reforms to address popular grievances.\n\nBut protesters have repeatedly told AFP they had \u201cnothing left to lose\u201d, and have scoffed at overtures by political and religious figures.\n\n\u2013 Lawmakers boycott \u2013\n\nParliament is scheduled to meet later on Tuesday to discuss the protests, but expectations were slim as the body failed to reach a quorum three days ago.\n\nThose boycotting included its largest bloc, the 54 MPs led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who threw his weight behind the demonstrations last week.\n\nWhen the protest movement first erupted, young, mostly male Iraqis gathered in the emblematic Tahrir (Liberation) Square, but security forces began closing off roads to the traditional gathering place and squeezed the protests further east.\n\nThey were eventually confined to the densely populated, chaotic district of Sadr City \u2014 Sadr\u2019s stronghold.\n\nOn Sunday night, rallies there left at least 13 people dead after they escalated into clashes with troops.\n\nThe army acknowledged using \u201cexcessive force\u201d and said they would hold commanding officers accountable.\n\nIn videos distributed on social media, protesters could be seen ducking into streets littered with burning tyres as volleys of gunfire and suspected heavy weapons were heard.\n\nIt was the first time security forces acknowledged using disproportionate force, a step cautiously welcomed by Amnesty International.\n\n\u201cThe security forces\u2019 admission of using excessive force is a first step that must be translated on the ground, to rein in the behaviour of security forces and the army,\u201d it said on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe next step is accountability.\u201d\n\nThe particularly chaotic scenes in Sadr City followed several days of witnesses reporting security forces unleashing tear gas and live rounds to disperse protests while authorities said \u201cunidentified snipers\u201d shoot at both protesters and police.\n\nMore footage is expected to emerge online once internet access fully returns across Iraq, where authorities have restricted access since Wednesday night.\n\nThe internet has been briefly restored during official speeches broadcast on state television \u2013- including Saleh\u2019s address on Monday night \u2013- but has been cut again afterwards.\n\nThe tentative calm returning to Baghdad comes a few weeks ahead of Arbaeen, the massive pilgrimage that sees millions of Shiite Muslims walk to the holy city of Karbala, south of Baghdad.\n\nNearly two million came last year from neighbouring Iran, which has urged citizens to delay their travel into Iraq in light of the protest violence.\n\nIts supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday \u201cenemies\u201d were trying to drive a wedge between Tehran and Baghdad, in an apparent allusion to the protests.\n\nThe sentiment was echoed hours later by the powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, which warned that those who sought to \u201cdefame Iraq will be punished\u201d.", "description": "Baghdad (AFP) \u2013 Iraq woke up Tuesday from its first quiet night after a week of anti-government protests that left dozens dead and sparked a crisis", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/5df012_week-mass-protests-left-100-people-dead-in-baghdad-in-cities-south-triggered-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
