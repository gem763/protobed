The last two, three, four weeks, every player \u2013 and Mesut Ozil \u2013 is working very well.\n\n\u2018This is why we can be positive and we can think we are going to do something important this year.'\n\nOzil started Arsenal's 2-2 draw at Watford last month but was substituted on 71 minutes before he captained the side in the 5-0 Carabao Cup win over Nottingham Forest.\n\nMesut Ozil 2019/20 Premier League appearances: 1 Goals: 0 Assists: 0\n\nSince then, the 31-year-old has been left out of Emery's squad for the clashes against Manchester United, Standard Liege and Bournemouth.\n\nOzil recently broke his silence to discuss his turbulent start to the campaign and said he is unfairly blamed whenever the Gunners don't perform.\n\n'If we don't do well in a big game, it's always my fault. If that's true, how do you explain our results in the big games when I wasn't involved? There's no real difference,' he told The Athletic.\n\n'I know people expect me to offer more, dictate play and make the difference. I do, too, but it's not straightforward.\n\n'I'm not the only player in the team and, don't forget, some of our opponents are simply better than us.'\n\nHowever, despite his lack of football, Ozil also added that he won't seek a move away from the club in the January transfer window.\n\n'You can go through difficult times like this, but that is no reason to run away and I'm not going to,' he said. 'I'm here until at least 2021.'", "description": "Mesut Ozil has been left out of Arsenal's squad for their clash with Sheffield United on Monday night.
