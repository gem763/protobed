The country had been due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, but the revised departure date is now October 31 after gridlock in parliament twice forced an extension.\n\nThe UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sent Brussels his government's proposals for a major rewrite of the previously negotiated Brexit deal. The UK plan crosses several EU red lines, fuelling concerns that it would bring a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\nMany believe that the robust stance of Britain's new nationalist leader makes a new withdrawal deal all but impossible to achieve. The UK parliament has legislated to try to block a disruptive \"no-deal Brexit\", but the government insists the country will leave the EU at Halloween.\n\nThe latest prolonged period of British political turmoil \u2014 which brought the downfall of Johnson's Conservative predecessor, Theresa May \u2014 comes three years after the UK's Brexit referendum.\n\nThe UK voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in June 2016. The result has increased strains between the UK's individual countries: England (53%) and Wales (52.5%) voted to leave, whereas Scotland and Northern Ireland voted by 62% and 56% respectively to remain in the EU.\n\nBrexit has been described as largely an English nationalist project, although factors such as austerity and frustration with traditional politics undoubtedly come into play. It feeds into a wider debate concerning the role of the nation state and the rise of populism in an age of globalisation. Many are concerned that it has shifted attention from major global challenges, not least the battle to contain climate change.\n\nFor many in Europe, the prospect of an institutionalised rift between the UK and the EU weakens the continent at a time when the likes of America, China and Russia are becoming increasingly assertive.\n\nLatest developments and stories (to October 4):\n\nWhy is Boris Johnson's latest Brexit plan a headache for the EU? | Euronews Answers\n\nTusk 'unconvinced' by Brexit plan: How Europe reacted to UK proposals\n\nUK Brexit adviser Shanker Singham: 'EU must compromise' on Irish customs\n\nFormer Conservative leadership candidate Rory Stewart resigns from party\n\nInside Dover: Europe's busiest ferry port prepares for Brexit\n\nUK in last-ditch drive to secure new deal as Brexit deadline looms\n\nAs October dawned with the clock ticking fast towards the Halloween deadline at the end of the month, the British prime minister finally submitted a new Brexit plan to the EU. It followed months of political and constitutional turmoil in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe document Boris Johnson sent to the European Commission president proposes a radical overhaul of the divorce agreement negotiated by Theresa May's government. EU leaders welcomed it as a positive step \u2014 but were quick to highlight problems as it became clear that huge gaps remained between the two sides.\n\nUnder the UK plan, the Irish border \"backstop\" would be stripped out and replaced with a \"two border\" solution.\n\nThe backup measure to guarantee an open border would no longer keep the UK in a customs union with the EU. Instead, Northern Ireland would leave along with the rest of the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. There would be checks but away from the border, with technology playing an important role.\n\nNorthern Ireland would remain aligned to EU single market rules for goods \u2014 an arrangement Belfast could review every four years, with the power to opt back into the UK system if it wanted to do so.\n\nBoris Johnson went into full throttle among buoyant supporters at the Conservative Party conference, calling on the EU to follow his lead and compromise in the face of his \"constructive and reasonable proposals\".\n\nThe UK government says it wants a new withdrawal agreement. But Johnson and his ministers have repeatedly insisted the UK will leave the EU on October 31, without a divorce deal if necessary.\n\nHowever, the UK parliament has legislated to try to force another delay to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Another showdown between government and lawmakers beckons if no deal is struck with the EU.\n\nThe forthcoming European Council summit of EU leaders on October 17-18 is seen as a crucial date in terms of securing a deal.\n\nThe challenge is immense. A new deal would have to be negotiated and approved by the 27 other EU countries, and passed by the UK and European parliaments \u2014 all in under four weeks. The process under the May government's doomed attempt took two years.\n\nKey dates:\n\nOctober 17\u201418: the last scheduled European Council summit before Brexit day.\n\nOctober 31: the date when the UK is due to leave the EU.\n\nConstitutional storm as Supreme Court rules suspension of parliament unlawful\n\nThe UK\u2019s new prime minister suffered a humiliating defeat when the country\u2019s highest court ruled that his government had acted unlawfully in early September by suspending parliament for five weeks.\n\nThe 11 judges in the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the decision to prorogue parliament unlawfully prevented it from carrying out its constitutional role without good reason, and was null and void.\n\nBoris Johnson argued at the time that the move had nothing to do with Brexit, and was standard procedure to allow the government formally to set out its agenda in a new parliamentary session.\n\nThe government\u2019s opponents had argued the prorogation was intended to muzzle them over Brexit and ensure the UK left the EU on October 31.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling represents a significant check on executive power by the judiciary, and has severely tested the United Kingdom\u2019s unwritten constitution. It has also further highlighted the country\u2019s deep divisions over its future in Europe.\n\nJohnson \u2013 resisting calls to resign \u2013 said he strongly disagreed with the judgement but respected the independence of the courts. Parliament resumed the following day amid rancorous scenes, but the impact of the Supreme Court ruling on Brexit itself is uncertain.\n\nThe prime minister lost his majority in the House of Commons after expelling more than 20 Conservative MPs who rebelled against the government's no-deal stance.\n\nLawmakers have also rejected Johnson's bid to call an early general election, until an extension to the UK's EU membership is secured.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrexit timeline: Boris Johnson's month of turmoil in September\n\nWhat is the Supreme Court in the UK? | Euronews Answers\n\nView: Westminster chaos shows UK electoral system is not fit for purpose\n\nCan a no-deal Brexit be stopped?\n\nIn the absence of any intervention to secure an alternative arrangement, the default legal position is that the UK will leave the EU on October 31.\n\nIf his attempt at renegotiation fails, Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he is determined to respect that deadline and take the UK out of the EU without a deal \u2014 a stance which won strong support among Conservative Party members, but which many say would be disastrous.\n\nIn parliament, a majority of MPs are determined to block such a scenario. The new law known as the Benn Act obliges Johnson to write to the EU asking for a three-month extension until January 31, unless parliament has either approved a deal or consented by October 19 to leave without one. The British government has said it will adhere to the law, while vowing to test what it describes as a \u201cSurrender Act\u201d to the limit.\n\nSome observers believe that Johnson's hand would be forced by the law. Opponents of no-deal are divided, however, between those who want the UK to leave the EU with a deal, and those who want to stop Brexit.\n\nEU countries would have to agree unanimously to another Brexit extension for it to take effect. In April some countries, led by France, argued for only a short delay and might be even more reticent to prolong the UK's EU membership another time.\n\nThe EU \u2014 unlikely to want to be seen to be expelling the UK \u2014 is thought likely to grant an extension if requested, albeit perhaps attached to conditions. The European Parliament has voted to support a Brexit extension should the UK ask for one.\n\nRead more: How Boris Johnson could bypass the Benn Act and force a no-deal Brexit\n\nWhat is Boris Johnson's Brexit policy?\n\nThe UK's stance towards Brexit took on a distinctly harder edge when Boris Johnson entered Number 10 Downing Street, raising the likelihood that the country will leave the EU without a withdrawal deal.\n\nThe former foreign secretary and London mayor took over the reins after winning the Conservative Party leadership contest. He signalled immediately a reinvigorated drive to take the UK out of the EU on October 31, \"no ifs or buts\", and appointing prominent Brexiteers to key posts in his new cabinet.\n\nThe prime minister has said flatly that he will not extend Brexit \u2014 he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" \u2014 insisting that \"the UK will come out anyway\" even if no deal is struck.\n\nThe government says it wants to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the European Union, to ensure the UK leaves the EU in an orderly fashion. The deal struck by Theresa May\u2019s government was rejected three times by the UK parliament.\n\nHowever, the Johnson government has significantly ramped up its no-deal preparations, with more funds promised.\n\nThe Conservative conference in Manchester had a new slogan, repeatedly cited by the prime minister. \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d has echoes of the \u201ctake back control\u201d rallying cry of the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign during the 2016 referendum campaign. Opinion polls have suggested the Tories still command a significant lead over opposition parties.\n\nTheir critics argue that far from settling Brexit, leaving the EU without a deal would resolve nothing \u2013 bringing only economic chaos and a new era of uncertainty.\n\nRead more:\n\nWho is Johnson's adviser Dominic Cummings, the man 'running the country'?\n\nWho got the top jobs in Boris Johnson's new government?\n\nBoris Johnson: diplomatic disaster, EU basher or reincarnated olive \u2014 who is the new UK leader?\n\nUpon taking office in July, the new prime minister took some by surprise with a demand for the Irish backstop to be removed from the negotiated withdrawal deal \u2014 a demand that was quickly rebuffed by the EU. Johnson followed up with a formal plea in August, arguing that the backstop is anti-democratic and inconsistent with UK sovereignty.\n\nThe backstop is essentially an insurance policy to avoid a hard border \u2014 such as border posts \u2014 and protect the cross-frontier economy between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (part of the EU), post-Brexit. In the absence of a free trade deal it would keep the UK close \u2014 and Northern Ireland even closer \u2014 to the EU.\n\nThe withdrawal deal was negotiated by London and Brussels over an 18-month period and approved by the 27 other EU governments in November 2018 \u2014 before being rejected three times by the British parliament.\n\nRunning parallel to the Brexit saga has been the UK's evolving relationship with the United States, with which Britain hopes to strike a future trade deal. Boris Johnson met President Donald Trump at a G7 summit and admitted talks would be tough. Trade experts say the UK faces a key choice over regulatory alignment: whether to stay close to EU rules to access the European market, or follow American regulation.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrexit: what is the Irish backstop and why does Boris Johnson want it ditched?\n\nNorthern Ireland conflict 50 years on: will a no-deal Brexit threaten the peace?\n\nDoes ditching the Irish backstop threaten the Good Friday Agreement? #TheCube\n\nCan Johnson obtain a new Brexit deal?\n\nMuch depends on how the EU responds to the prime minister's revised Brexit plan submitted to Brussels. European leaders want to remain united on the issue and not to dismiss it out of hand. Yet critics say some of the proposals cross fundamental EU red lines.\n\nSeptember brought a flurry of reports suggesting that the two sides may be prepared to compromise on arrangements concerning Northern Ireland. Meetings were stepped up, but several Brexit players and observers said the reality was that on the detail the gap between the two sides remained large.\n\nThe British government, determined to replace the backstop, has gone further than originally planned over Northern Ireland's participation in the EU's single market. But the proposal to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive role could be problematic, given deep-rooted political divisions and the EU's need to preserve the single market's integrity.\n\nOn the issue of customs and the Irish border, the stance of EU leaders remains fundamentally unchanged. They insist that any alternative to the backstop must be just as credible and legally enforceable. Diplomats have been quoted as being pessimistic over a breakthrough.\n\nThe UK government has been encouraged by the EU's willingness to consider a new plan, having long refused to re-open the existing withdrawal agreement.\n\nThere was frustration in EU circles at the UK\u2019s reluctance to communicate detailed proposals on paper. The British government\u2019s supporters argued that any such move far ahead of the October EU summit would be folly.\n\nSome in Brussels and among the EU27 countries feel the withdrawal agreement is already generous to the UK. EU leaders have been more open, however, to modifying an agreed framework for future ties.\n\nThe two sides' positions appear hard to reconcile. The UK wants to keep many benefits from the existing arrangements but is intent on leaving the EU's single market and customs union \u2014 and taking control of its money, borders and laws. The EU's priority is to preserve its cohesion, along with the integrity of its single market, institutions and founding principles \u2014 as well as upholding peace and security on the island of Ireland as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nRead more: 'Very little time': Johnson's letter to EU chief Juncker on latest Brexit plan\n\nWhat happens in a 'no-deal scenario'?\n\nShould the United Kingdom leave the European Union without a formal exit deal, legal arrangements covering many aspects of everyday life \u2014 including the rights of British and European citizens \u2014 would abruptly cease to apply. It would also bring an immediate change in the trading relationship between the UK and the EU.\n\nAlthough some believe the fallout would quickly force both sides back to the negotiating table, relations would be further damaged \u2014 especially if the UK refused to pay its \"divorce bill\", as Boris Johnson has threatened to do.\n\nA \"no-deal\" Brexit would hit the UK's economy but also those of its closest neighbours on the continent \u2014 and particularly the island of Ireland, where the survival of a hard-fought peace accord is at stake after decades of political violence.\n\nMany political leaders, institutions, companies and individuals have warned of severe disruption and economic damage on both sides of the English Channel \u2014 with the UK being hit worse than the EU.\n\nHowever, Brexiteers have long dismissed \u201cProject Fear\u201d forecasts and some argue that the UK could survive perfectly well under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.\n\nGovernment documents, published in early September and codenamed \"Operation Yellowhammer\", confirmed a grim assessment of the potential impact of a no-deal scenario. Based on the government's own preparations for a no-deal Brexit in a \"worst case\" scenario, they contained warnings of possible food, medicine and fuel shortages.\n\nThe heightened uncertainty amid a winter of British political turmoil forced the UK and the EU, as well as people and businesses on both sides of the English Channel, to step up no-deal preparations ahead of the original March deadline. Such plans are now being revived in the run-up to October 31.\n\nRead more:\n\nNo-deal Brexit: everything you need to know\n\nNo-deal Brexit: what would 'WTO terms' mean for UK-EU trade?\n\nWhat would no-deal mean for citizens' rights: EU nationals in the UK and Britons in the EU?\n\nHow would no-deal affect travel and consumers?\n\nIn March the European Commission said it had completed its no-deal preparations, having released its Contingency Action Plan for Brexit in December. In a no-deal scenario, it confirms that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and Britons on the continent would no longer be protected at European level \u2014 and lays out basic plans to regulate financial services, air transport, road haulage, customs and exports, and climate policy.\n\nTheresa May's government published a series of papers \u2014 some updated under her successor \u2014 advising UK citizens and businesses on the consequences and how to prepare for no-deal. It said the EU would treat the UK as a \"third country\", and there would be no agreement on applying arrangements set out in the exit deal.\n\nBritish economic sectors reliant on close, smooth arrangements with Europe have warned of the dangers of new costs and restrictions being imposed overnight. Among those sounding alarm bells are manufacturing industries \u2014 including the car industry, food and drink, chemicals and pharmaceuticals \u2013 as well as the health service, tourism, and financial services. There have also been warnings over farming and fishing \u2014 despite strong support for Brexit from within these two sectors.\n\nBrexit and business \u2014 read more:\n\n'Brexit destroyed by business': The small business owners who left the UK\n\nNo-deal Brexit will hit UK consumers hard \u2014 British Retail Consortium\n\nNo-deal Brexit impact would 'ripple on for years', reports warn\n\nUK at risk of 'full-blown' recession \u2014 Office for Budget Responsibility\n\nUK firms cut investment plans as Brexit alarm hits new high \u2014 survey\n\nEuropean carmakers call for clarity over Brexit\n\nUK car industry warns next PM against 'seismic' no-deal Brexit\n\nJaguar commits to building electric vehicles in UK \u2014 but calls for Brexit deal\n\nJapan's NTT invests big in London amid Brexit uncertainty\n\nAs the process dragged on without formal approval for an exit deal from the UK and EU parliaments, the focus shifted even more sharply to \u201cno deal\u201d preparations.\n\nIn August 2019, after the Bank of England lowered its growth forecast for the UK post-Brexit, its governor Mark Carney warned that in the event of no deal the economy would suffer an instant hit, prices would rise and the pound would fall, and even large profitable industries would become \"uneconomic\".\n\nIn April a leaked letter by the government's most senior civil servant warned of an economic recession, food price rises, a severe impact on Britain's security services, police forces and legal system, and a return to direct rule by the UK government in Northern Ireland. In early August a leaked government document contained similar warnings.\n\nIn June, the same civil servant, Sir Mark Sedwill, said government and public services were in \"pretty good shape\" to cope with a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. He added that in the private sector the level of preparedness varied from sector to sector.\n\nIn November 2018, two major reports by the UK Treasury and the Bank of England assessed the potential damage to the British economy of various Brexit scenarios.\n\nIn its assessment of EU preparations for no-deal, the UK House of Commons Library describes the Commission's programme as one of \"damage limitation\" to protect the EU27 countries.\n\nRead more:\n\n'Operation Yellowhammer': UK releases 'no deal' Brexit documents predicting border delays\n\nUK announces \u20ac2.3bn for no-deal Brexit preparation\n\nBrexit: should Boris Johnson and the Tories get real over no deal?\n\nHow we got here: Brexit delay brings European election electroshock\n\nJohnson's appointment follows a prolonged period of turmoil in British politics. This came to a head when Theresa May \u2014 who failed to get her EU divorce deal through parliament \u2014 became the latest in a long line of Conservative prime ministers to be brought down by Europe.\n\nIn the wake of the repeated parliamentary defeats for the EU divorce deal, the House of Commons twice forced the British government to seek to delay Brexit. EU national leaders met for a special European Council summit on April 10 and agreed to a six-month \"flexible extension\" to the UK's departure from the bloc, with a new exit date set for October 31. The country can leave earlier if its parliament approves the negotiated withdrawal deal.\n\nBut the extension of the UK's EU membership forced the country to take part in the European Parliament elections in May \u2014 and send 73 newly-elected MEPs to Strasbourg in July.\n\nNigel Farage's new Brexit Party, which advocates leaving the EU without a formal agreement, came top of the European vote. But there was a strong showing from pro-EU parties, in particular, the Liberal Democrats, who want to reverse Brexit altogether.\n\nBritain's two main parties \u2014 the Conservatives and the Labour opposition \u2014 were severely punished by voters. Many Conservatives are furious at the failure to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d, while Labour has been accused of sitting on the fence.\n\nThe results indicated that opinion in the UK is becoming still more polarised over Brexit, confirming the results of surveys which suggest that people have become increasingly entrenched in two camps \u2014 those who wish to remain in the EU, and those who are determined to leave, even with no deal.\n\nRead more:\n\nBrexit delay: what changes with the extended deadline to October?\n\nBrexit delay prolongs 'crippling' limbo for EU and UK expats\n\nEU citizens in Scotland: 'Living here makes me feel safe and at home'\n\nWhat does the rejected Brexit divorce deal contain?\n\nIn November 2018 the British government and EU leaders approved a deal on the terms of the separation \u2014 the Withdrawal Agreement \u2014 and a Political Declaration on the nature of future EU-UK ties.\n\nDespite its triple rejection by the UK parliament, the EU insists the Withdrawal Agreement is the only one on offer and cannot be altered. It is ready, however, to modify the Political Declaration. A successfully ratified deal would pave the way for an orderly UK exit from the European Union, quickly followed by full trade talks between the two sides.\n\nThe near 600-page Withdrawal Agreement would be legally binding and settles the key \u201cdivorce\u201d issues: the UK\u2019s financial obligations to the EU, citizens' rights \u2014 those of EU citizens living in the UK and Britons living on the continent \u2014 and arrangements for the Irish border. Set to become the only land frontier between the UK and the EU, both sides agree this must remain open, but the historically sensitive and complex issue bedevilled the talks.\n\nA ratified exit deal would also pave the way for a the way for a planned transition period to come into effect after the UK\u2019s departure. During this period many existing arrangements would remain in place, allowing for more time to sort out future EU-UK relations and avoid an abrupt \u201ccliff-edge\u201d exit.\n\nIf no UK-EU trade deal was agreed by the end of December 2020 \u2014 although an extension to this period is possible under the draft accord \u2014 a \"backstop\" mechanism would come into force to keep the Irish border open. This would set up a basic UK-wide customs union with the EU, but with Northern Ireland more deeply integrated with the bloc's rules.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat's in the Brexit deal and why is it so unpopular?\n\nHow Theresa May's Brexit deal protects EU citizens living in the UK \u2014 if it's ratified\n\nHow May's deal protects UK citizens living in the EU \u2014 if it's ratified\n\nThe Political Declaration accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement is much shorter and covers future relations. The 26-page document is not legally binding \u2014 but could form the basis for a trade agreement to be negotiated after Brexit.\n\nUnlike Conservative Eurosceptics and Northern Irish unionists who have focused their hostility on the backstop arrangements in the Withdrawal Agreement, the UK's Labour Party has emphasised its opposition to the Political Declaration. Leader Jeremy Corbyn has argued that the document is too vague and would lead the UK into a \"blindfold Brexit\".\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, has said a permanent customs union \u2014 favoured by Labour \u2014 could be included in the Political Declaration. But although the issue was considered in the cross-party talks, the discussions foundered.\n\nRead more: Political Declaration: the details\n\nWhy did the UK parliament repeatedly reject the deal?\n\nAt the heart of the debate over Europe in the United Kingdom is the balance to be struck between two objectives: a desire for independence, sovereignty and autonomy against the need to retain access to European markets, which, the EU has always insisted, means adhering to EU rules.\n\nTheresa May insisted the negotiated withdrawal deal was in the national interest and there was no viable alternative. She argued that it delivered on the referendum result: an end to free movement, an end to huge UK payments to the EU, and an exit from the unpopular EU structures on farming and fishing.\n\nHowever, the agreement brought hostility from both supporters and opponents of Brexit. In parliament, an alliance of forces resulted in the successive defeats for the government.\n\nThe main Labour opposition said the deal did not meet its six Brexit tests.\n\nDerailed by the backstop\n\nThe controversial backstop, the mechanism in the agreement to guarantee an open border on the island of Ireland, proved to be a major stumbling block. The difficulty is that the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland \u2013 one of the most politically sensitive borders in the world \u2013 will become an EU-UK land border after Brexit, yet the UK wishes to pursue an independent trade policy.\n\nThe backstop envisages the UK remaining in a \"single customs territory\" with the EU in the absence of a free trade deal, as a kind of insurance policy to keep the border open.\n\nEurosceptic critics suspect it will keep the UK strapped permanently to EU trade policy. EU sources pointed out that the UK-wide mechanism in the withdrawal agreement was included at the UK\u2019s request, to avoid splitting off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), on whose support the May government depended, vehemently opposed any move it believes might separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. Under the backstop, as set out in the deal, Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy is the Irish backstop so important in Brexit negotiations?\n\nWhy is the Irish border issue so complex?\n\nIrish border: can technology remove the need for a backstop?\n\nWhat 'alternative arrangements' are there to the Irish backstop?\n\nAs the clock ticked down towards the original March 29 deadline, the UK and the EU said they had agreed a revised Brexit deal following weeks of deadlocked talks between London and Brussels. The British parliament had voted to seek \u201calternative arrangements\u201d for the backstop after the first parliamentary defeat.\n\nEU27 leaders had refused to alter the text of the withdrawal agreement. But Theresa May said she had secured legally-binding changes over the backstop\u2019s application. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said \u201cmeaningful legal assurances\u201d had been given \u2014 while warning that there would be \"no third chance\" to revise the deal again.\n\nHowever, leading members of the Conservative anti-EU European Research Group (ERG) and the DUP rejected the new proposals, after consulting new legal opinion on the deal from the government's top lawyer. The deal suffered a second defeat on March 12.\n\nThe government decided the third vote in the House of Commons on March 29 would be only on the withdrawal deal, not on the declaration on future relations. This was partly to conform to a ruling by the Speaker who insisted on substantial changes from the previous vote. However, it still ended in defeat by 58 votes.\n\nThe parliamentary deadlock prompted moves by MPs from different parties to wrest control of the Brexit process and allow a series of \"indicative votes\" to explore alternative solutions to the government's deal. But there has been no majority for any particular solution, other than an opposition to no-deal.\n\nHow did Brexit get into such a mess?\n\nThe turmoil in the British domestic political scene has cut across party lines. Internal party divisions have affected both the UK government and opposition.\n\nThe ruling Conservative party has long been riven between Eurosceptic and Europhile factions. The main Labour opposition has seen tension between its largely pro-EU membership and a leadership more inclined to deliver Brexit. Both parties have been damaged by the issue.\n\nIn early 2019, the Tories in particular haemorrhaged support to the new hardline Brexit Party. Meanwhile, both Conservatives and Labour suffered defections of some MPs to a new pro-EU centrist party \u2014 since renamed \"The Independent Group for Change\" \u2014 for reasons that included their leaders' stances on Brexit.\n\nTory turmoil boils over\n\nThe defeated UK-EU exit deal represented a compromise. But the blurring of several of Theresa May's so-called \"red lines\" on the limits of EU power sparked fury within her divided Conservative Party. As negotiations with Brussels brought more UK concessions, a string of government resignations followed.\n\nAfter the 2017 general election, which left the Tories severely weakened in parliament, hostility amid their own ranks to any moves towards a \"softer\" Brexit restricted May's room for manoeuvre. Eurosceptics including the DUP strongly opposed her Brexit plan and the subsequent agreement, with many calling for the UK to leave the EU with no deal. They argue the accord ties the UK too closely to EU rules, compromising independence perhaps far into the future.\n\nRead more:\n\nArticle 50 a year on: Brexit 'red lines' change colour\n\nNot all doom and gloom: the Brexiteers' case for a 'hard Brexit'\n\nBoris Johnson leads Brexit charge \u2014 but is 'taking back control' an illusion?\n\nEqually, several pro-EU MPs also opposed a deal which, in their view, would leave the UK worse off than it had been inside the bloc. Some joined calls from opposition parties for a second referendum to see whether the country had changed its mind on Brexit.\n\nPressure from Tory Europhiles obliged the prime minister to open the door to a Brexit delay. Although she had long resisted calls from the Labour opposition for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU, she suddenly changed tack on April 2 \u2014 only for cross-party talks to collapse weeks later.\n\nTheresa May's fate was sealed after she revealed a fourth plan for getting her thrice-rejected Brexit deal through parliament. She tweaked the legislative package and crucially opened the door to a possible confirmatory referendum \u2014 a move which angered many in her party and sparked another government resignation.\n\nRead more:\n\nAs Brexit looms, the UK's Conservative Party fights for survival\n\nHow Brexit defined then destroyed Theresa May's premiership\n\nWhat is the stance of UK opposition parties?\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party has been criticised for an ambiguous Brexit policy, blamed for its poor performance at local and European elections in May.\n\nDespite gradually moving towards backing a public vote to resolve the Brexit crisis, the leadership's reticence to support Remain has angered many among its large pro-EU membership.\n\nLeader Jeremy Corbyn has won backing for his strategy at the party's annual conference. His stance is to try to win an election, renegotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU which would be put to a public vote against an option of Remain. But his commitment to neutrality on the choice itself \u2014 set out in an article in the Guardian \u2014 has been criticised.\n\nIt was the latest in a series of interventions on the issue. On July 28 leader Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would campaign for the UK to remain in the EU if Boris Johnson tried to implement a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHe followed this up with a letter to MPs on August 14, vowing to hold a no-confidence vote in Johnson's government, which if passed would be followed by a temporary government under his leadership. Brexit would be delayed and a general election held \u2014 with Labour campaigning for a second referendum, with an option to remain in the EU.\n\nRead more: Why are opposition parties lagging behind Boris Johnson's Tories?\n\nLabour set out its position after the June 2016 referendum, saying it respected the result. It defined its priorities as securing a customs union with the EU and access to its markets, as well as ensuring the protection of standards over the environment, and consumer and workers' rights.\n\nThe party later moved to back a new EU referendum under certain conditions. Its National Executive Committee agreed on April 30, 2019, to support Labour's alternative plan for Brexit, and back a public vote if it couldn't secure changes to the government's deal or a general election.\n\nThe issue has caused internal divisions. Corbyn had resisted another referendum, and many MPs in Brexit-supporting constituencies are also hostile. But he has come under intense pressure from the party membership, and some prominent frontbench figures who favour another public vote.\n\nFollowing Labour's election defeats in May, Corbyn said the \"only way out\" of the Brexit crisis was either a general election or a referendum on a deal. Deputy leader Tom Watson called for another referendum regardless, and for Labour to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nOn July 9 Labour tipped further in the direction of advocating a public vote \u2014 and backing EU membership. In a letter to party members, Corbyn called for a referendum on any Tory deal \u2014 or no deal \u2014 on Brexit, adding that Labour would campaign to remain in the EU. However, the letter did not spell out what Labour would do in power \u2014 bringing more accusations of ambiguity.\n\nRead more:\n\nLabour party members vote against pro-EU stance for election run\n\nJeremy Corbyn: Britain's prime minister in waiting?\n\nThe pro-EU Liberal Democrats and the Independent Group for Change both oppose Brexit, and support a second referendum on the UK's EU membership.
