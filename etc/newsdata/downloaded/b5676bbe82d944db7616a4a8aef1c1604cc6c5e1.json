And while sharks still petrify this reader, there\u2019s no doubt that Mr. McKeever makes a glorious \u2014 and eloquent \u2014 case for why the shark\u2019s beauty, majesty and complexity should be respected.\n\nThe author spreads his investigation across a series of eye-catching chapters. His introduction is titled \u201cMan Bites Shark,\u201d and from there he proceeds with his engaging account in chapters that include \u201cSharks as Social Animals,\u201d \u201cThe Sex Lives of Sharks,\u201d \u201cShark Warriors,\u201d \u201cShark Alley\u201d and \u201cSave the Shark\u201d among others. He is very pro-shark in the sense that he appreciates the shark\u2019s role as an \u201capex predator\u201d \u2014 something that allows the shark, be it white shark, tiger shark or bull shark, to be the master of his domain, and whose noblesse oblige makes his mandate one of keeping ocean ecosystems inhabitable.\n\nAnd while the book as a whole has the feel of an extended paean to one of God\u2019s great creatures, it is also a political book. Greenpeace is revered, shark hunting is not, and the human factor in all of this is, well, to behave more responsibly toward the species who could kill you if it wanted to, but more often than not has other things to do. \u201cWhile sharks kill an average of four humans a year, humans kill 100 million sharks each year. That is not a typo. Humans kill 100 million sharks each year.\u201d\n\nPeople seek out shark fins for shark fin soup, they\u2019ve sought shark cartilage to cure cancer (it doesn\u2019t) and overall \u201c[h]umankind has taken the ocean\u2019s apex predator and upended its position treating the shark as if it had the fecundity of a codfish.\u201d\n\nBut life and people are like that. Mr. McKeever tellingly quotes Charles Darwin at the end of a paragraph he devotes to the hammerhead:\n\n\u201cWhile hammerheads are hunted constantly, their lives are quite ordinary; they live in their home territories, find mates, produce, and die. In that sense there is little difference between the life of the hammerhead and the life of humans. Yet humans are different and we have unique attributes. Darwin made the distinction clear. He said, \u2018The love for all living creatures is the most noble attribute of man.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201c\u2018Great is the power of steady misrepresentation.\u2019\u201d Mr. McKeever notes, \u201cThe misrepresentation of sharks has led to greatest threat to the hammerhead\u2019s existence in 20 million years. \u2026 Our misconceptions about sharks as solitary, bloodthirsty species continue to be upended. Scientists continue to discover that sharks have more in common with people than previously believed.\u201d\n\nMr. McKeever sets out his case and makes it well. The book proceeds apace and rarely fails to inform and delight. Some digressions, particularly his ventures into human trafficking at sea, make the reader yearn for the focus to return to the sharks. These are relieved by other moments that can only be called priceless. The shark named Mary Lee, who was tagged so her maneuvers could be followed, vanishes early on. The scientist who released her back into the sea, and named her after his mother, notes plaintively, \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was ever going to have the opportunity to name another shark.\u201d\n\nThere is whimsy here, and lightheartedness, but Mr. McKeever keeps himself anchored to science and to his concerns that sharks will be over-hunted despite their declining numbers and to their peril. A section on shark tournaments where shark hunters can earn thousands of dollars from high-stakes bets is particularly unnerving. Nevertheless, the book takes its strength from the call of the sea and the lure of the shark that the author so carefully chronicles. Mr. McKeever presses for conservation so \u201cwe can ensure that our children will look out on the ocean and know that underneath the surface, a shark will be swimming, standing guard over its dominion, protecting the ocean, the greatest miracle on earth just as it has done for more than 450 million years.\u201d\n\nAnd as for the shark\u2019s fearsomeness, perhaps Peter Benchley, the author of the novel \u201cJaws\u201d should get the last word. \u201cThe shark in an updated version [of \u201cJaws\u201d] could not be the villain.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Carol Herman is deputy editorial page editor and books editor at The Washington Times.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nEMPERORS OF THE DEEP: SHARKS \u2014 THE OCEAN\u2019S MOST MYSTERIOUS, MOST MISUNDERSTOOD, AND MOST IMPORTANT GUARDIANS\n\nBy William McKeever\n\nHarperOne, $25.99, 320 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
