According to a new survey by consumer research group Kantar, one in three UK wine drinkers don\u2019t like spending more than \u00a35 per bottle.\n\nIt\u2019s said anything north of that feels too expensive for a quiet night in. But, after a decade of tax hikes and subsequent rising wine prices, sniffing out bottles at this level is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\nSpend \u00a35 on a wine and a staggering 64 per cent of the cost now goes to the Treasury. That\u2019s \u00a32.23 per bottle before VAT. Take out the packaging, shipping and distribution costs \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s cut \u2014 and you\u2019re left with less than 50p worth of wine in the bottle.\n\nBritish drinks expert Helen McGinn picked out a selection of the best wines under-\u00a35 in UK stores, including Cotes de Gascogne Colombard Sauvignon Blanc (pictured)\n\nAs a former supermarket wine buyer \u2014 and a lover of a bargain \u2014 I know from experience that cheap doesn\u2019t always mean cheerful. It can mean insipid and downright ropey.\n\nSpend just a little more and you\u2019re likely to get better value for money and a greater choice of wines. The sweet spot, quality-wise, is often between \u00a37 and \u00a39. After that, you\u2019re likely to be paying more because the wine is made in smaller quantities or has a prestigious name.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of drinkable wines costing a fiver or less. You\u2019ve just got to know where to look. If you just grab a random bottle off the shelf at this price, it\u2019s more likely to be a miss than a hit. But follow my guide and you could come away with a real bargain.\n\nYou can now even find organic and Fairtrade wines at this price, as well as ones from famous regions including Beaujolais and Cotes du Rhone. When it comes to countries, head for wines from Spain and France, southern Italy and Chile. They might not linger on the palate, but they won\u2019t leave a bad taste, either.\n\nHere\u2019s a selection of the best of the under-\u00a35 bunch on the shelves\u2026\n\nWhite\n\nCLEVER BLEND\n\nCotes de Gascogne Colombard Sauvignon Blanc, \u00a34.99, Lidl\n\nA clever little blend made from the relatively cheap (and relatively bland on its own) Colombard grape, brightened up with aromatic Sauvignon Blanc. It\u2019s from south-west France and tastes like it\u2019s worth at least a couple of quid more. 3/5\n\nDINNER-PARTY STAR\n\nTesco Vina del Cura Rioja Blanco 2017, \u00a35\n\nHelen says Tesco Vina del Cura Rioja Blanco 2017 (pictured) is lemony with a floral twist, ideal for a dinner party\n\nA glorious white Rioja made from the Viura grape. It\u2019s lemony with a floral twist, and there\u2019s no oak to get in the way of the lovely citrus flavours. It\u2019s dinner-party worthy \u2014 no one will guess it\u2019s only a fiver. 5/5\n\nCHRISTMAS PICK\n\nGers 2018, \u00a35, Marks & Spencer\n\nHelen recommends stocking up on Gers 2018 (pictured) for Christmas parties, she describes the beverage as bright and light\n\nAnother gem from Gascony in south-west France. It\u2019s made from the Colombard grape by one of the best co-operative producers there. Bright and light, with hints of ripe pear and crisp apple, this is certainly one to stock up on for Christmas parties. 4/5\n\nFRUGAL FAIRTRADE\n\nCo-op Fairtrade Chenin Blanc 2018, \u00a34.80\n\nHelen says Co-op Fairtrade Chenin Blanc (pictured) from South Africa is like a tropical fruit salad in a glass\n\nThe Co-op fields a strong range of Fairtrade wines and, amazingly, some come in at under \u00a35. This one from South Africa is fantastic \u2014 think tropical fruit salad in a glass. Fairtrade funds have helped improve a community centre in the region where the wine is made. 3/5\n\nZESTY SURPRISE\n\nMakaraka Sauvignon Blanc 2018, \u00a34.99, Aldi\n\nHelen claims Makaraka Sauvignon Blanc 2018 (pictured) is a pleasant surprise for a cheap Sauvignon\n\nCheap Sauvignon is at least usually best approached with caution. But this one from New Zealand is a pleasant surprise. It\u2019s zesty, with enough of that trademark Sauvignon character to not leave your palate feeling cheated.4/5\n\nHARD TO RESIST\n\nMorrisons Soave 2018, \u00a34.35\n\nHelen advises those who are searching for an inexpensive Italian white to try Morrisons' Soave 2018 (pictured)\n\nIf you\u2019re after an inexpensive Italian white with classic, soft lemon flavours and a hint of almond, this is it. OK, so I\u2019d rather have a bottle of Morrisons\u2019 smarter Soave Classico, but, at more than \u00a32 cheaper, it\u2019s hard to resist this bargain. 3/5\n\nRos\u00e9\n\nCITRUS TWIST\n\nYallaroo Ros\u00e9, \u00a34.99, Aldi\n\nHelen says Yallaroo Ros\u00e9 (pictured) is crisp, has light raspberry flavours and a twist of citrus\n\nFrom Australia, this is as pale as a Provence ros\u00e9, but not quite as dry. It\u2019s crisp, with light raspberry flavours and a twist of citrus. It\u2019s a good-looking bottle, too, if you like that sort of thing. 4/5\n\nOH-SO QUAFFABLE\n\nWaitrose Ripe & Juicy Spanish Ros\u00e9, \u00a34.99\n\nHelen says Waitrose Ripe & Juicy Spanish Ros\u00e9 (pictured) is dangerously quaffable, with plump red berry flavours\n\nThis might be as basic as the Waitrose range gets, but it definitely delivers what it promises. The Garnacha grapes add plenty of plump red berry flavours. This is dangerously quaffable. 3/5\n\nPINK AND PERKY\n\nMountain Vineyards Ros\u00e9, \u00a35, Tesco\n\nHelen claims Mountain Vineyards Ros\u00e9 (pictured) from the Western Cape of South Africa, has a fresh, tropical flavour\n\nThis is a great addition to the Tesco range. Made from grapes grown in the Western Cape of South Africa, it has a fresh, tropical flavour. It\u2019s properly pink and perky \u2014 and much better than some costing a bit more. 5/5\n\nRed\n\nA REAL WINNER\n\nTesco Cotes du Rhone 2018, \u00a34.50\n\nHelen recommends stocking up on Tesco Cotes du Rhone 2018 (pictured) from France, if you're throwing a party\n\nWhen I tasted this, I had to check the price with the buyer. Twice. I couldn\u2019t believe a wine this good, from such a famous French region, could be this cheap. If you\u2019re throwing a party, make sure this wine, with juicy red fruits and a gentle kick of spice, gets an invite. 5/5\n\nHINT OF VANILLA\n\nBaturrica Tarragona Gran Reserva 2012, \u00a34.99, Lidl\n\nHelen says Baturrica Tarragona Gran Reserva 2012 (pictured) has gorgeous bramblefruit flavours and a hint of vanilla\n\nFrom Spain\u2019s Tarragona region, this looks suspiciously good for the price, with its gold cage and sleek label. But what\u2019s inside more than matches up, with gorgeous bramblefruit and a hint of vanilla. 4/5\n\nJUICY GEM\n\nTesco Beaujolais Rouge 2018, \u00a35\n\nHelen adores Tesco Beaujolais Rouge 2018 (pictured) for its raspberry jam flavours and all-round juiciness\n\nOften the best way to find a good, cheap wine is to look for an unfashionable region, where prices tend to be sensible. But Beaujolais is on a roll at the moment, so I am thrilled that this one manages to sneak in at a fiver. I adore its just-squashed raspberry jam flavours and all-round juiciness. 5/5\n\nORGANIC AND EARTHY\n\nToro Loco Organic Red, \u00a34.99, Aldi\n\nHelen says Toro Loco Organic Red (pictured) is a little rough around the edges and earthy\n\nThe other wines in this delightful range fly off the shelves, and I love this organic addition. It\u2019s a little rough around the edges, but given that it\u2019s (a) organic and (b) cheap as chips, I\u2019m more than happy to embrace the earthiness. Made from the Bobal grape, grown in the Utiel-Requena region in Spain, it\u2019s an absolute bargain. 4/5\n\nFRUITY FIND\n\nCo-op South African Red, \u00a34.60\n\nHelen says Co-op South African Red (pictured) is a gem, at a cracking price for such a drinkable red\n\nAnother gem from the Co-op, this is a medium-bodied fruity red from the Western Cape of South Africa. It\u2019s made from the Cinsault grape, more commonly found lurking in a blend alongside other grapes, but here it takes centre stage. It\u2019s a cracking price for such a drinkable red. 3/5\n\nBARGAIN BEAUTY\n\nCepa Lebrel Rioja Joven, \u00a34.99, Lidl\n\nHelen says Cepa Lebrel Rioja Joven (pictured) has bold raspberry and black cherry flavours\n\nThis is basically a baby Rioja. The word joven means young in Spanish, and indicates the wine hasn\u2019t been anywhere near an oak barrel. Made from the Tempranillo grape, this is bold and bright with characteristic raspberry and black cherry flavours. At 13 per cent ABV, it\u2019s not a beast. And, at this bargain price, it\u2019s definitely a beauty. 4/5", "description": "British wine expert Helen McGinn, reveals the best wines under-\u00a35 available from UK supermarkets.
