A change in interest rates, an unexpected turn in the economy, a meager showing from corporate taxes or a sudden spike in spending could mean the Treasury would hit a hard limit weeks earlier \u2014 or later \u2014 than estimated.\n\nOutside of the Treasury Department, Akabas\u2019s X Date analysis was perhaps the only estimate of what the Treasury\u2019s real timeline was, and it was widely seen as the most reliable.\n\nTalks moved into high gear, and before the month was through, Congress had agreed on a spending deal and passed legislation that would prevent a default.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thrilling to be able to see the work that you put in go towards a good purpose in terms of impacting public policy,\u201d Akabas said in a recent interview with The Hill.\n\n\u201cThe only disappointing thing in the whole debt limit element is that I most enjoy informed public policy that is proactively helping people achieve better economic and financial outcomes that improve their lives. This is more about preventing a catastrophic outcome,\u201d he added.\n\nBorn and raised in New York, Akabas had always had a knack for math, but it was a family connection in the form of census expert Terri Ann Lowenthal, an aunt, that helped direct his interests toward the public sphere.\n\n\u201cWe used to visit her down in D.C.,\u201d Akabas said of Lowenthal, who at the time was the staff director for the House census oversight subcommittee.\n\n\u201cIt was thrilling to sort of see how public policy works, and so I knew that that was an element of interest to me,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell and working on New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg Michael Rubens BloombergFrom learning on his feet to policy director Biden struggles to reverse fall Democrats' debate divisions open the race to new (or old) faces MORE\u2019s reelection campaign, Akabas planned to stay in New York, but a job at the Bipartisan Policy Center caught his eye.\n\n\u201cI sort of knew what a think tank was, but not exactly, and it was gonna be doing economic research \u2014 that was sort of the extent that I understood about it. I knew it was related to fiscal policy and debt reduction,\u201d he said.\n\nThe year was 2010, and the sudden rise of the Tea Party had thrown fiscal issues into the spotlight. Akabas was put onto a task force headed by former New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici (R) and Alice Rivlin. She was a towering figure in the world of budget policy who had been the first director of the Congressional Budget Office, headed the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget and had served as vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nShortly after Akabas started, then-President Obama had appointed Rivlin as one of 18 members of an official debt-reduction group known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission, giving Akabas\u2019s work a direct line to government policy.\n\nAkabas, who had no previous expertise with the federal budget, had to learn on his feet.\n\n\u201cIt was effectively getting a master\u2019s degree in economics,\u201d said Akabas, who later got his actual master\u2019s from Georgetown.\n\nHe recalled meeting Michael Bennet Michael Farrand BennetBennet: Warren 'not being honest about' her 'Medicare for All' plan Senate Democrats want Warren to talk costs on 'Medicare for All' The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden camp faces new challenges MORE, then a Democratic candidate for his current Colorado Senate seat, at a fundraiser. They talked about some of the issues facing the federal budget. After Bennet was elected, he embraced the types of fiscally sustainable policies the two had discussed. That, Akabas said, was the moment he realized the impact of his work.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t work for a member of Congress. I\u2019m not an elected official. I don\u2019t work in the administration, but I love being able to have those conversations and educate and inform people about the decisions that they\u2019re making and oftentimes getting to see the work that we\u2019re producing embodied in whatever gets put forward,\u201d he said.\n\nAkabas\u2019s next project at the Bipartisan Policy Center focused on the debt ceiling and paired him with Jerome Powell, now the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Akabas said Powell, who had served as a Treasury undersecretary in the second Bush administration, saw the issue of debt ceiling becoming more politicized and worried that lawmakers were not well-informed on the issue.\n\n\u201cJay, much to his credit, realized that this was going to be a problem,\u201d Akabas said.\n\nIt was through that connection that Akabas began working on the so-called X Date, a term he credits Powell with coining.\n\n\u201cWe were in the position of effectively explaining to people: Here\u2019s what the debt limit is, here\u2019s why it matters, here\u2019s our independent estimate, which was generated from either Congressional Budget Office data, Treasury data combination, and other sources of when that X Date would arrive. And we were learning on the job,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans were skeptical of the Obama administration\u2019s estimates, he said, thinking they were being fed politicized information to add pressure in negotiations. That left an opening for independent analysis.\n\nSoon enough, leaders such as then-Speaker John Boehner John Andrew BoehnerIs Congress retrievable? Boehner reveals portrait done by George W. Bush Meadows to be replaced by Biggs as Freedom Caucus leader MORE (R-Ohio) were briefing their caucuses with Bipartisan Policy Center data as the debt ceiling increasingly saw mainstream media attention.\n\nSince then, Akabas has risen to lead the economic department at the center, continued to refine the X Date analysis and turned much of his attention toward issues such as retirement security.\n\nWhile he has no plans to leave the think tank that launched his career nearly a decade ago, Akabas says he would be open to switching gears and serving on the government side of the ledger, should the opportunity arise.\n\nAkabas credits mentors such as Rivlin and Powell with much of his achievement.\n\n\u201cIf you sort of attach yourself to people who you see as visionaries, leaders in a particular realm, it\u2019s sort of endless, the amount that you can glean from following them around on a day-to-day basis,\u201d he said.", "description": "In July, 31-year-old think tank researcher Shai Akabas achieved something that hordes of well-funded lobbyists and power players in Washington often fail to do: He got Congress to take action.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/akabasshai_101819gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
