European shares led the charge, with the broad Euro STOXX 600 jumping 1.1% and heading towards its strongest day since late August.\n\nFrankfurt's main index , seen as sensitive to the trade war because of its export-oriented stocks, jumped 1.7% and was on course for its biggest daily gain since June.\n\nA rally in Asian shares had earlier set the positive tone, with an index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbing 1.4%. And the positive mood was set to spread to Wall Street, too, where futures gauges EScv1 NQcv1 added about 1%.\n\nThe improvement in hunger for riskier bets came after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called the first day of trade talks with China in over two months \"very, very good.\" talks between U.S. and Chinese negotiators fed hopes that the two sides could dial down the 15-month trade war that has upset financial markets and supply chains across the world, and delay a U.S. tariff hike scheduled for next week.\n\nTrump reiterated plans to meet China's Vice Premier Liu He on Friday at the White House.\n\nExpectations of progress on Thursday had pushed up U.S. markets, with Wall Street gaining around 0.6%.\n\nYet investors said markets were hoping for, at best, a deal limited in scope, and they noted that sunny rhetoric had in the past failed to translate into more meaningful moves.\n\n\"I would caution that we have been here before, where we have seen positive talk,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P.
