We definitely don't feel it gives them an advantage and it doesn't intimidate us.\n\n\"It\u2019s more of an honour for us to face it. It maybe lifts them a little bit more, and there may be some signs behind that which gives them a little bit more of an advantage - I\u2019m not knowledgeable enough to tell you if it does.\n\n\"But it was certainly interesting, it was certainly exciting. It was certainly something new, and it brought some spice to the Test match.\n\n\"I don't think it was disrespectful, and it was something new for everyone in world rugby. I wouldn't make a big issue about it, but it\u2019s not for me to decide.\"\n\nKick-off on Saturday is at 11:00 (SA time).", "description": "Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus doesn't think England's reaction to the All Black haka this past weekend was disrespectful.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7984/d0579803d0214309acc2a2b782be7890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
