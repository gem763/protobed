The stock rebounded when the company announced a new product line mid-week, but Friday took a major wallop when Pivotal Research Group initiated coverage of the company -- but with a \"sell\" rating sending the stock down to a near 20 percent drop. However, good news came after the bell with some came newfound support from a major financial player.\n\n\u201cWe see dramatically more competition that will likely drive the cost of OTT devices to zero,\u201d Pivotal analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak wrote in a note sent to investors on Friday morning.\n\nWhile the stock for the \"over the top\" device provider is up more than 252 percent for the year, this week is indicative of just how volatile the streaming landscape is for Roku -- and other players.\n\nWlodarczak cited a variety of recent market developments, such as Comcast\u2019s announcement of a free alternative, the Xfinity Flex streaming box, which they will give to their internet-only subscribers, that, he feels, \u201cis likely to be copied by other distributors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis will put pressure on hardware and subscription revenues, but it does improve prospects for subscription video-on-demand services offered through them, as well as advertising and \"other\" revenues that can be generated via free, ubiquitous distribution.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for Roku, their already high advertising splits (50/50) with OTT players also potentially sets them up to be undercut by competitors and distributor\u2019s already massive content spend gives them enormous leverage,\" the report contends.\n\nThis all leads Wlodarczak to question how Roku can compete with the \u201cbig boys\u201d led by Comcast, which Pivotal rates a \u201cbuy,\u201d and that this will make Roku\u2019s \u201cgrowth much more difficult.\u201d\n\n\"In our view Roku stock still looks dramatically overvalued despite the recent pullback and we are initiating with a 'sell' and a $60 target price,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nThe report did provide a bright spot for Roku, saying its \u201cmanagement deserves a lot of credit for what they have created and Roku is one of the few OTT investment pure-plays.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for comment, a Roku spokeswoman told FOX Business, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on the views of one analyst,\u201d and attempts to reach Wlodarczak for additional comment were unsuccessful.\n\n\"In our view Roku stock still looks dramatically overvalued despite the recent pullback and we are initiating with a 'sell' and a $60 target price\u201d Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak\n\nAfter the closing bell, Oppenheimer Funds countered with an announcement that they are maintaining their \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and raising their price target to $155 from $120 \u201cafter evaluating the impact of Roku's international expansion plans and the slew of new OTT streaming services coming to market in 4Q and in 2020.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer\u2019s upside scenario analysis is $200 if \u201csmart TV penetration continues to grow globally\u201d and if a \u201cconsolidated market structure prevails.\u201d The firm also estimates \u201cthat Apple+, Disney+ and a mix of others (notably HBO Max) will provide $21/share in combined upside,\u201d and that they \u201csee Roku \u2018cashing in on their US market penetration (~33%), promoting and selling SVOD subscriptions directly, with competition from new entrants (Comcast\u2019s and FB\u2019s Portal) as being too late.\u201d\n\nThis shows Oppenheimer takes the exact opposite view of the impact of Comcast\u2019s Xfinity Flex streaming box, as well as Facebook\u2019s offering, on Roku's prospects moving forward.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg ROKU ROKU INC 108.05 -25.71 -19.22%\n\nOppenheimer also sees the United Kingdom market adding $10 a share if they can take share from legacy brands \u201cthrough a similar playbook to the US: drive consumer adoption through high-quality, modestly priced TVs through OEM [original equipment manufacturer] partnerships.\u201d\n\nWhen Wall Street opens for trading Monday morning, possibly this upgrade - which predicts Roku\u2019s stock price will return to the levels it opened with this week - could provide a bounce.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Two analysts see Roku's stock going in different directions", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/11/0/0/roku-device.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
