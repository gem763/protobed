Mark Amodei (R-NV) on Friday told reporters in Nevada that he supports the Democrats' impeachment inquiry, although he doesn't necessarily support impeaching President Donald Trump, The Nevada Independent reported.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put it through the process and see what happens. I\u2019m a big fan of oversight, so let\u2019s let the committees get to work and see where it goes,\u201d Amodei said on the conference call with reporters. \u201cUsing government agencies to, if it\u2019s proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. If it turns out that it\u2019s something along those lines, then there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAfter The Nevada Independent published their article, Amodei released a statement reiterating his support for an impeachment inquiry, but not necessarily impeachment itself. He said his position mirrored that of Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV).\n\n\"I think from all of that information, we have to follow the facts and figure out what happened here,\" Cortez-Masto told KTVN-TV.\n\n\u201cFollowing that call, Nevada Independent reporter Humberto Sanchez released an article. The first paragraph of Mr. Sanchez\u2019s article reads: \u2018Rep. Mark Amodei supports the House\u2019s inquiry into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, but is withholding judgment on whether Trump has crossed the legal line,'\u201d the congressman explained.\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely an accurate statement in the sense that the House and Senate have both unanimously supported the resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the whistleblower complaint received on August 12, 2019, by the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, should be transmitted immediately to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives. It is also accurate that the White House supports this same resolution. In no way, shape, or form, did I indicate support for impeachment. Rather, I stressed my complete agreement with Senator Cortez-Masto\u2019s (D-NV) statement...\" Amodei explained.\n\n\u201cAnyone who reads Mr. Sanchez\u2019s article and thinks that somehow there is a vote to convict before the process has played out \u2013 as called for by the resolution unanimously supported by everyone concerned \u2013 is simply, individual fantasy,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the congressman, he wants to know the facts of what took place between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why we have the committee process. I won\u2019t attribute what was in the president\u2019s mind. That wasn\u2019t a great way to express concern about it. Part of what the committees will do is try to find some context for that and then based on what a fair reading of the context is, they\u2019ll go forward from there,\" Amodei told the Independent. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it was a partisan spy or not. The only thing I get a vote on is, if it comes to the House floor\u2026 do I think that there is evidence there that is credible, that says he broke a specific law?\u201d", "description": "Huh..09/28/2019 17:21:17PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/260/04609b62-a977-4989-aa1a-9660ff208bd1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
