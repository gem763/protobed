As Max McGerry (Jo Martin) and Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) operated on him (not without drama in itself), Ric apparently woke up in a version of Holby City hospital where he met some people who\u2019d been hugely important to him. Some dead people.\n\nSo was this heaven? Diane Lloyd (Patricia Potter) and Ric\u2019s son Leo (Daon Broni) \u2013 now CEO and consultant surgeon respectively \u2013 didn\u2019t seem to quite know what it was, despite living there. \u2018Leo \u2013 you\u2019re dead,\u2019 Ric said as he came face to face with his late son. \u2018I hate to break this to you, Dad, but so are you,\u2019 Leo replied. When Diane told Ric she was married (we never found out who she was married to), she joked, \u2018This is Paradise, after all.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis dark humour was a thread throughout the dreamlike sequences. Ric protested that he wasn\u2019t in Paradise, and the whole things was \u2018a manifestation of my subconscious brought on by exposure to heavy sedatives and severe trauma.\u2019 \u2018You say potato,\u2019 Diane said drily. Leo and Diane told Ric there was nothing wrong with his brain \u2013 it was his heart that was the problem, because it was \u2018empty and rotten\u2019 It needed replacing. Naturally Ric was alarmed to hear this and wanted a second opinion, so who better that Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel)?\n\nOnly the Jac Naylor in this alternate reality was a hippy-dippy \u2018Wellness Advisor.\u2019 \u2018Do you need help with emotional harmony?\u2019 she asked Ric, and it looked like Rosie Marcel was enjoying herself enormously. Hippy Jac still gave Ric a completely Jac-like view of who he was, though: \u2018You\u2019re Leo Griffin\u2019s deadbeat emotionally distant gambling addict absentee father.\u2019\n\nThat, in a nutshell, was why he was there. It was all about Ric\u2019s subconscious dealing with things that had always bothered him, the deaths of two people he\u2019d loved deeply and that he felt he\u2019d failed. Hope and the future were represented by great-granddaughter Erica (Leah Mondesir-Simmonds), now an older child though poignantly we and Ric could still hear her baby cries in the background. After he\u2019d made some sort of peace with Diane and been forgiven by Leo, it was Erica who gently but insistently led him to the exit door, back to life \u2013 where Serena was waiting for him to wake up.\n\nShe\u2019ll help with your emotional harmony (Picture: BBC)\n\nThere was so much going on in this episode that I couldn\u2019t possibly mention everything. Long-time Holby viewers were given lots of little Easter eggs including a portrait of Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon) that hung on the corridor wall, a ward named after Zubin Khan and the information that Donna (Jaye Jacobs) was now still married to Kieran, Connie Beauchamp was the Health Secretary, Serena\u2019s daughter Elinor was still alive and so was Bernie. Serena and Bernie were still together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was all very dramatic and gothic and sometimes strayed a little too far towards parody, such as when Diane told Ric, \u2018Your presence here is destabilising\u2019 and Leo added, \u2018Your coming here has opened a rift,\u2019 but it was hugely entertaining and brilliantly connected to the real-life scenes in the operating theatre as Max and Serena battled to keep Ric alive.\n\nDominic gets a surprise (Picture: BBC)\n\nIn complete contrast there was another storyline playing out which was set in the business-as-usual world of Keller. Helen (Verity Marshall), pregnant with Lofty (Lee Mead)\u2019s baby, was back on the ward after a road accident. Dominic (David Ames) had planned to surprise Lofty with a cruise to Hawaii, so he asked Lofty to come up to Keller at 12.30. When Lofty arrived he was greeted by hula dancers and Hawaiian music (Dom is never subtle) \u2013 and Helen. Now Lofty knows that he\u2019s going to be a dad, and he knows Dominic\u2019s known for a while, so once again Dofty are on a rocky footing with each other. Lofty questioned whether he and Dom were really working as a couple, and Dominic insisted that they could all make it work \u2013 as a family.\n\nIt\u2019s times like this that Holby could really do with a resident Wellness Advisor.\n\nSue Haasler is the author of five novels and the official BBC Holby City book, which you can read about here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "As he was operated on, Ric saw some familiar faces.", "authors": ["Sue Haasler"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ric-holby-43-483b_1571239373.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
