The two targeted a pair of tourists travelling in the region. Police found American Chynna Deese, 24 and her partner Australian Lucas Fowler, 23 with multiple gunshot wounds near their camper van.\n\nCanada manhunt fugitives recorded final video messages, family says Read more\n\nSchmegelsky and McLeod also admitted to killing Vancouver botanist Leonard Dyck, whose body \u2013 found with a single gunshot wound \u2013 was discovered on 19 July.\n\nBut nowhere in the videos do the two young men express remorse for the murders, nor do they provide insights into the motivation behind their killing spree.\n\n\u201cThey were cold. They were remorseless, matter of fact,\u201d RCMP assistant commissioner Kevin Hackett told reporters.\n\nThe grim events kicked off one of the most extensive manhunts in Canadian history this as the two young men fled across the country, eluding search teams for weeks. They passed through mountains and open prairie fields before finally slowing down amid the thick, swampy forests of northern Manitoba \u2013 a journey of nearly 3,000 km.\n\nPolice used drones, dogs and heat seeking cameras in the search for Schmegelsky, 18, and McLeod, 19. At one point, the Canadian military was deployed to comb through vast tracks of impenetrable wilderness.\n\nCanada murders: teenage suspects died by apparent suicide, police say Read more\n\nIt was only after discovering a series of items police believe were linked the young men near the town of Gillam, that their bodies were eventually found along the banks of a river on 7 August, more than two weeks after the exhaustive search had begun.\n\nPolice have decided not to release the videos \u201cin an effort not to sensationalize the actions of McLeod and Schmeglsky\u201d which could, in turn, prompt further acts of violence.\n\n\u201cThose who commit mass casualty attacks are heavily inspired by previous attackers and their behaviours,\u201d the police report said.\n\nFrom the videos, the police learned the two had initially intended to trek up northern Manitoba to Hudson Bay, where they would steal a boat and travel to either Europe or Africa.\n\nBut the fast-moving river where they spent their last days affected their ability to move, and in one video, they suggest they will likely have to kill themselves.\n\n\u201cWe believe the location where they ended up affected their mobility,\u201d said Hackett.\n\nKnowing their were in their final days, McLeod and Schmegelsky shaved themselves, \u201cplan[ning] to go back and kill more people and expect[ing] to be dead in a week,\u201d said the police report.\n\nTeenagers' trail of mayhem across Canada leads to wilds of Manitoba Read more\n\nAccording to forensic evidence, it is believed McLeod shot Schmegelsky with a rifle, before turning the weapon on himself. Police were also able to match the bullets used to kill Fowler and Deese to the murder of Dyck, nearly 500 kilometres away.\n\nThe same guns were also used in the suicide of the two young men and were found with them in Manitoba. One, a semiautomatic rile, was purchased legally by McLeod. The other, police said, was built using multiple parts from a number of different guns.\n\nPolice also released details of a chilling encounter along the Alaska Highway, two days after Fowler and Deese were killed.\n\nA driver had pulled over along the road to nap, but saw a man with a gun approaching his car.\n\n\u201cThe male \u2026 started moving towards the witness in a tactical or hunting stance,\u201d the report said. The driver quickly sped away.\n\nAs part of the investigation, police spoke extensively with family and friends, all of whom initially refused to believe the pair could be capable of cold-blooded violence, describing them as \u201cgood kids\u201d.\n\nAfter their abandoned vehicle was discovered, McLeod and Schmegelsky had initially been described to the public as missing persons. But on July 22, a witness approached police and suggested the two might have been involved in the murders.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that police learned that McLeod and Schmegelsky may be capable of the murders which conflicted with original witness statements from family and associates,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe press conference and report mark the end of the high-profile case, in which police said they received more than 1,000 tips, but were nonetheless unable to determine a motivation for the crimes.", "description": "Killers recorded video confessions of murders of Australian tourist, his American girlfriend and Canadian professor", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c1a3ec322ff5cdf2c79b9c7f059fe363cded1d/0_108_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=41ca9c8621f30f20b4ba2fba35a89b6b", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
