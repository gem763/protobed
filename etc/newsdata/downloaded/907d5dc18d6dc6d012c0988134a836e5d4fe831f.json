That is despite Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount\u2019s blistering starts.\n\nLampard wants his established stars to pull their weight, too. Olivier Giroud has not had much of an opportunity, however, with the prolific Abraham keeping him out of the team.\n\nAbraham, their 22-year-old centre forward, is the club\u2019s top scorer on nine goals. He is then followed by 20-year-old Mount on four. Both are now away on England duty.\n\nFikayo Tomori, the 21-year-old defender, was also called up by Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate.\n\nSince losing to Liverpool, Chelsea have secured four impressive wins. They beat Grimsby 7-1 in the Carabao Cup, then Brighton 2-0 in the Premier League, Lille 2-1 in the Champions League and Southampton 4-1 in the top flight.\n\nNewcastle visit Stamford Bridge next on October 19.
