Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating.\n\nEstonian police said that Rehe had not been seen since he left his home in Tallinn, Estonia's capital, on Monday.\n\nEstonian prosecutors confirmed that Rehe had been questioned as a witness, not a suspect, in a case opened in December last year against 10 former Danske Bank employees. This involves the alleged laundering of around 300 million euros.\n\nThe police said Rehe's death would not be investigated.\n\n\"There are no signs of violence on the corpse, and there is no indication of an accident ... There will be no investigation opened,\" police said after finding Rehe's body near his home.\n\n\n\n\n\nWITNESS IN CASE\n\nEstonian police had issued a missing persons appeal on Monday, saying Rehe had left his home that morning and his family had no information about his whereabouts.\n\nDozens of people had joined a search for the 56-year-old in forests around his home in a Tallinn suburb, a well-off neighborhood of small houses which is surrounded by large areas of parkland.\n\n\"He was questioned as a witness in the case,\" a spokeswoman for the Estonian prosecutor's office said of Rehe, adding that the investigation was continuing.\n\nThe spokeswoman declined to give any further details, while the Danish prosecutor declined to say whether Rehe was or had been the subject of its investigation.\n\nSome Estonian parliamentarians said the death would hurt the chances the full story of money laundering scandal will ever be told.\n\n\"I hope it can still happen though,\" said Peeter Ernits of far-right EKRE.\n\nDanske Bank extended its condolences to Rehe's family.\n\n\"We are sad to receive the news that the former chief of our Estonian brand, Aivar Rehe, is dead. Or thoughts go out to the family,\" it said in a statement.\n\nRehe rarely spoke publicly about the case, which began to come to light in 2017, but he had said that he felt responsible even though he thought anti-money laundering measures had been sufficient at the time.\n\n\"I do. Naturally. I spent 10 years running that bank, and they were all my people,\" he said in an interview with Estonian media outlet Postimees in March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tarmo Virki; additional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen; Editing by Jon Boyle, Alexander Smith and David Gregorio)", "description": "A former head of Danske Bank's  Estonian branch, which is at the center of inquiries into the world's largest money laundering scandal, was found dead on Wednesday.
