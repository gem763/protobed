But it continued to own a large slice of the ammunition market: about 20 percent overall. That share now could fall to as little as 6 percent, the company said.\n\nBeyond such practical implications, the move also may be significant in that it reflects shifting cultural views of gun ownership, said Chris Allieri, a crisis management expert and founder of Mulberry & Astor, a public relations firm in New York.\n\nElizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and other presidential candidates say Walmart should stop selling guns\n\n\u201cThis is a major move,\" Allieri said. \u201cThis is not some left-leaning, coastal CEO sending a tweet or two. This is Walmart saying. \u2018This is how we\u2019re going to do business going forward. Take note.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhile Walmart has locations in virtually every corner of the country, the Bentonville, Ark., company has long served more conservative regions where gun rights are cherished. In announcing the move, Walmart\u2019s chief executive Doug McMillon acknowledged the difficulty of the decision, referencing both a string of mass shootings \u2014 including one this weekend \u2014 and his own history of growing up in a hunting culture.\n\n\u201cIn a complex situation lacking a simple solution, we are trying to take constructive steps to reduce the risk that events like these will happen again,\u201d he said in a memo to employees on Tuesday. \u201cThe status quo is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nWalmart, which sells guns in about half of its 4,750 U.S. stores, will continue selling long-barrel deer rifles and shotguns, as well as other firearms and ammunition for hunting and sports shooting, McMillon said. It will also continue to allow customers to carry concealed firearms at Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club store, as long as they have proper permits. Executives did not offer details on how the changes might affect the company\u2019s financial performance.\n\nThere were already signs that Walmart\u2019s move was inspiring others to take similar action. Later on Tuesday, Kroger, the country\u2019s largest grocery chain, announced it would also be ending its open carry policy in stores, a year after it stopped selling guns and ammunition at its Fred Meyers chain in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAt Walmart, the decision comes after mounting pressure from gun-control advocacy groups, politicians and Walmart\u2019s own employees. About 40 white-collar workers in California walked off the job last month to protest its gun policies. E-commerce workers in Portland, Ore., and Brooklyn also urged the company to stop selling firearms and organized a Change.org petition. As of Tuesday afternoon, it had more than 142,000 signatures.\n\nCovered in princesses \u2014 and bulletproof: Inside the booming business of everyday ballistic gear\n\nThe protests followed a mass shooting in an El Paso Walmart that killed 22 people and wounded dozens of others. Days earlier, two Walmart employees were fatally shot at a store in Southaven, Miss., and a former employee has been charged in the shooting. And on Sunday, one person was shot and wounded at an Indiana Walmart, leading managers to evacuate the store.\n\nWalmart has tightened its gun policies over the years. It stopped selling handguns in every state but Alaska in 1993. Last year, it raised the minimum age for gun purchases from 18 to 21, two weeks after 17 students and teachers were killed in a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla.\n\nMcMillon, who is a gun owner, said the company is also calling on President Trump and members of Congress to advance \u201ccommon sense measures,\u201d like more stringent background checks.\n\nGun control advocacy groups like Everytown for Gun Safety applauded the retailer\u2019s decision and said it reflected a changing reality in which 94 percent of Americans support universal background checks, and 61 percent favor of tighter gun laws, according to a May poll by Quinnipiac University.\n\n\u201cAs the largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the country, Walmart has its finger on the pulse of what Americans want,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cThis decision reflects a clear reality \u2014 Americans want to be kept safe from gun violence.\"\n\nAmerica is turning against guns\n\nBut in taking a stand, the retailer also angered some of its shoppers. The company made its fortune selling low-priced goods in Red State America, where many of its most loyal shoppers are hunters and gun owners.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful to see Walmart succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites,\" the National Rifle Association said in a statement. \u201cLines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nIn prohibiting the open carry of firearms, Walmart joins a number of other big-name retailers, including Target, Starbucks and Chipotle.\n\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods overhauled its gun sales policies last year after a shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school. Gun reform became a particular issue for its chief executive Ed Stack, who became even more concerned about firearms policies after learning the perpetrator of that attack had once purchased a shotgun from a Dick\u2019s store.\n\nTech giant brings software to a gun fight\n\nA few weeks after the rampage, Stack announced Dick\u2019s was pulling all military-style weapons from its stores and banning high-capacity magazines and \u201cbump stocks\u201d that could effectively convert semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. Stack also announced Dick\u2019s would not sell firearms to people younger than 21.\n\nDick\u2019s has never disclosed what share of its sales come from guns alone. Still, the company has continued to reevaluate its hunting business. In a 2018 pilot program, the company took all guns out of 10 stores and filled the empty space with products targeted for those markets, like sports team merchandise. Those 10 stores outperformed the rest of the chain and have continued to deliver, executives have said.\n\nIn March, Dick\u2019s removed all guns from 125 of its roughly 730 stores. Stack told The Washington Post earlier this year the company would consider whether to expand that roster based on how those locations performed. In a company earnings call last month, Dick\u2019s President Lauren Hobart said it was too soon to gauge the strategy\u2019s success.\n\nPresidential hopefuls Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.) were among the Democratic candidates who had called on Walmart to change its gun policies in recent weeks. On Tuesday, they said they were heartened by the company\u2019s stance but said they expected more.\n\n\u201cThis is a good start \u2014 but it\u2019s not nearly enough,\u201d Warren said on Twitter. \u201cWalmart can and should do much more. And we need real gun reform, now.\u201d\n\nRachel Siegel contributed to this report.", "description": "The changes come after recent shootings at Walmart stores left at least 24 people dead.", "authors": ["Abha Bhattarai", "Reporter Covering The Retail Industry"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ETLJ5MVZFAI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg"}
