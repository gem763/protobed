Queer As Folk (1999) Russel T Davies\u2019s groundbreaking Channel 4 series was unapologetic in its portrayal of gay men and their sex lives, and taught a pearl-clutching British public about rimming.

Boy George on Top of the Pops (1982) When Culture Club appeared on Top of the Pops to perform \u201cDo You Really Want To Hurt Me?\u201d, the androgynous look of its colourful frontman threw viewers and the UK tabloids into a spin. BBC 17/25 9. Lady Gaga - \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (2011) Lady Gaga\u2019s love of the LGBT community, and her status as \"Mother Monster\" for all outcasts, was brilliantly channelled into this mainstream dance hit.

Philadelphia (1993) The first mainstream film to portray the HIV/Aids crisis was built on a haunting performance from Tom Hanks and brought an understanding of the issue to millions of cinemagoers. Rex Features 24/25 2. RuPaul's Drag Race (2009) The show that launched a thousand memes. RuPaul\u2019s incredible popularity is a testament to how widely the show reached out beyond the LGBT community and into the wider public, who have been duly educated about drag culture and the courage of those who take part. Getty Images 25/25 1. Will and Grace (1998) Will and Grace was the first time a sitcom put gay characters front and centre, and delighted audiences with its razor-sharp wit.
