Most recently, Shadow made a splash at Jeff Bezos' re:MARS robotics conference when the Amazon CEO tried out its new set of robot hands, which are controlled remotely by a haptic-feedback glove. In layman's terms, this means not only do the robotic hands mirror the person's movements, they also relay the sensation of touch back to them.\n\nRead more: Jeff Bezos took the controls of some \"weirdly natural\" giant robot hands but could not solve the riddle of a Rubik's cube\n\nI went to Shadow's London office to try the hands out for myself. The office looks every inch like a tech startup, complete with two office dogs \u2014 Milo the Jack Russell Terrier and Henry the Husky \u2014 but the company has actually been going for 22 years. For most of its lifespan, it was focused purely on building robot hands for research, but in the last few years, it's broken more into the consumer space.\n\nWhile Shadow made the robot hands themselves, the whole project has been done in tandem with two other companies, HaptX and Syntouch. HaptX develops VR and reproducing the sensation of touch for people operating machines remotely, and is responsible for the gloves. Syntouch specializes in making materials capable of relaying touch to people, and made the touch sensors that go on the end of the robot's fingers.\n\nHere's what it was like to use the gloves:", "description": "Shadow Robotics is a London company which has been building robot hands for 22 years.
