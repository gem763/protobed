Ms Steggall told Sky News she wants \u201can independent advisory committee\u201d to report on and advise the government on meeting long-term goals towards acting on climate change. \u201cThe government is adamantly saying we\u2019re going to meet our 2030 targets, but the science community says we\u2019re not,\u201d she said. The crossbench MP said on Thursday she does not want to \u201cwait until 2030\" to find out if the government's climate targets have been met.
