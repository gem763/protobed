(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nWhile Jay Gruden declined to name a starting quarterback for Sunday\u2019s game against the New England Patriots on Monday, vowing to play the person he thinks will give his team the best chance to win, the Redskins coach faced criticism for his decision to play first-round rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins in Washington\u2019s loss to the Giants.\n\nGiven the Redskins\u2019 numerous injuries to offensive starters and that Gruden had repeatedly said Haskins wasn\u2019t ready to play, former Redskins scout and director of player personnel Louis Riddick, now an analyst with ESPN, called the move \u201cone of the worst decisions\u201d he\u2019s seen this year \u201cas far as how people are handling young quarterbacks.\"\n\n\u201cWhy would you put him in there under any circumstances?\u201d Riddick said on ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown.\u201d \u201cIt reeks of an agenda, to me, as far as he\u2019s not ready to play, the team is suffering. You\u2019ve heard all along, going back to the draft, that the front office wanted one [quarterback in the draft], the coaching staff wanted another guy. That type of thing, right off the bat, you think Dwayne Haskins doesn\u2019t hear that? You think he feels totally supported in this entire process? I talk all the time about setting people up for success. That young man, right now, is being set up for failure, and Dan Snyder needs to recognize that. \u2026 He should\u2019ve never went in that football game [on Sunday].\u201d\n\nRiddick\u2019s ESPN colleague, Stephen A. Smith, agreed, and called for Gruden to be fired immediately.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all about people getting their money, and I hope that Jay Gruden keeps his money,\u201d Smith said Monday on \u201cFirst Take.\u201d \u201cThe man\u2019s got to go. I\u2019m talking about now. Jay Gruden needs to go now. He\u2019s not the guy. [Sunday] was an indictment against him. I thought we saw a guy in Dwayne Haskins that Jay Gruden had no intentions of playing, who was ill-prepared to be in that game. \u2026 Dwayne Haskins did not look like somebody that had been practicing [with the first team]. You can\u2019t do that to that kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call it coaching malpractice,\u201d former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky replied. \u201cThat\u2019s often why we see young quarterbacks in the NFL get ruined.\u201d\n\n[Ahead of Patriots game, Jay Gruden faces a familiar choice: Keenum, Haskins or McCoy?]\n\nNFL Network\u2019s Steve Wyche questioned Gruden\u2019s motivation for calling upon Haskins with the Redskins trailing, 14-0, in the second quarter. After the game, Gruden said he was concerned that Keenum, who missed a pair of touchdown throws, was bothered by a sore foot that kept him out of practice one day last week.\n\n\u201cThe question you have to be asking about Washington moving forward is, did Gruden put [Haskins] out there to say, 'Look, he wasn\u2019t ready, like I\u2019ve been telling you,\u201d Wyche said on \u201cNFL Now.\u201d \u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve heard, Jay Gruden has total control over the quarterback decision.\u201d\n\nOn Pro Football Talk\u2019s Overtime Live, Chris Simms wondered about Gruden\u2019s handling of his team\u2019s quarterback situation.\n\n\u201cIf they knew going into the game that [Keenum] might be on a short leash, and he has a banged up foot, they should\u2019ve just gone with Dwayne Haskins to start the week because they put Dwayne Haskins in a tough spot,\u201d Simms said. \u201c \u2026 He didn\u2019t really get the full week of practice and reps with the first team to put him in position [to succeed], nor did the team get to game plan specifically around him and put a game plan together that accentuates his strengths and hides some of the flaws. I just don\u2019t get that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis playing of Haskins Sunday, to me, was stupid,\u201d said The Team 980\u2032s Steve Czaban. \u201cHe got no reps this week. He had no reps before and you thought that Keenum was the best guy to give you a chance to win.\u201d\n\nSo, where do the Redskins go from here? The Team 980\u2032s Doc Walker thinks it\u2019s \u201ca foregone conclusion\u201d that Colt McCoy will start against the Patriots if he\u2019s healthy, and that might be best for Haskins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see him play with the benefit of a running game,\u201d Walker said of the rookie. \u201cWhat\u2019re the odds of that actually happening? Slim to none. Why kid yourself? Why put him through it? It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\nCzaban likened starting Haskins against the Patriots\u2019 top-ranked defense to a \u201csuicide mission,\u201d and former Redskins running back Clinton Portis remains of the opinion that the former Ohio State star needs to spend more time as the backup.\n\n\u201cDwayne Haskins does not need to be on the field,\u201d Portis told Grant Paulsen and Danny Rouhier on 106.7 The Fan. \u201cYou saw [Sunday] \u2026 the development he still needs. Dwayne Haskins, I think he has a huge upside once he develops and gets a full grasp of this system. I think he\u2019s going to be great in it. \u2026 If you continuously leave Haskins on the field with what we\u2019re facing and we don\u2019t succeed, then guess what people are going to be asking for at the end of the season, with the first pick [in the draft]?\u201d\n\nThe Team 980\u2032s Kevin Sheehan has a different take.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pressure to win games anymore this year,\u201d Sheehan said Monday. \u201cThe rest of this season is about rebooting and finding out, from a player perspective, who\u2019s going to be a part of your future. If Dwayne Haskins isn\u2019t ready, get him ready! If he can\u2019t handle the full playbook, cut it in half! If he doesn\u2019t give your team the best chance to win games this year, who the hell cares?! He\u2019s gotta be ready to give your team the best chance to win games next year, and the following year and the year after that. If he\u2019s not the right guy, we need to know that now, this year.\u201d\n\nSheehan wouldn\u2019t wait to start Haskins in Week 6 against the winless Miami Dolphins, either. He argued that the Patriots represent an opportunity for the rookie that should be embraced.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not afraid,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cHis psyche isn\u2019t fragile. He played at Ohio State in much bigger games and in front of much bigger crowds than the ones he\u2019s going to play in for the rest of the year. Instead of fearing the worst for him against the big, bad Patriots, why not consider the upside of him playing well? It\u2019s no-lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point, what else can go wrong?\u201d former Redskins wide receiver Santana Moss asked Chad Dukes on 106.7 The Fan. \u201cIf you had enough confidence in the kid [on Sunday], go ahead and put him out there against the Patriots. I think he\u2019s only going to get better.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nJay Gruden may be fired, but he may be the best man for this particularly awful job\n\nCase Keenum and Dwayne Haskins struggle, Redskins run game hits new low\n\nThe key moments from the Redskins\u2019 24-3 loss at New York\n\nThis wasn\u2019t about Jones vs. Haskins.
