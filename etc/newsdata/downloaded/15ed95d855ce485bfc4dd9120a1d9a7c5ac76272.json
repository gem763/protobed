Biden on Wednesday said it\u2019s hard to avoid concluding that President Trump committed an \u201cimpeachable\u201d offense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a blatant abuse of power. \u2026 I don\u2019t think it can stand,\u201d Mr. Biden, the former vice president, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d \u201cBased on the material that they acknowledge[d] today, it seems to me it\u2019s awful hard to avoid the conclusion that it is an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Wednesday released a transcript of a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that showed Mr. Trump bring up Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe suggested that Mr. Zelensky look into Mr. Biden\u2019s claim that he pushed to get rid of a prosecutor who had reportedly been eyeing an energy company where Hunter Biden was on the board at the time.\n\nBut there\u2019s no explicit statement from Mr. Trump saying he would withhold military aid from Ukraine unless Mr. Zelensky agreed to investigate the Bidens, as Democrats have suggested.\n\nMr. Biden said he\u2019s confident the House and the Senate can deal with it. Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced this week the House is opening a formal inquiry into whether Mr. Trump committed impeachable offenses.\n\n\u201cMy job is just to go out and flat beat him,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWe want to get his attention \u2014 have 70 polls in a row showing you beating him. And that all of a sudden gets his attention. And so I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m the object of his attention.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
