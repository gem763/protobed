Kennedy during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, written in the excitable style of US President Donald Trump\u2019s recent letter to Turkey.\n\nThe parody letter, originally from ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d TV show, is written on mocked-up White House letterhead and addressed to Russia\u2019s then leader Nikita Khrushchev.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, ok? Get your missiles out of Cuba,\u201d starts the letter pretending to be from president Kennedy.\n\n\u201cEverybody will say \u2018Yay! Khrushchev! You\u2019re the best!\u2019 But if you don\u2019t everybody will be like \u2018what an asshole\u2019 and call your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe letter echoes the bizarre tone of Trump\u2019s October 9 letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in which he warned that he would wreck Turkey\u2019s economy if its invasion of Syria went too far.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2014 and I will,\u201d Trump wrote in a letter many people thought was fake until it was verified by the White House.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Trump finished, adding: \u201cI will call you later.\u201d\n\nThe joke letter from Kennedy to Khrushchev ends: \u201cYou\u2019re really busting my nuts here. Give you a jingle later,\u201d before signing off \u201cHugs, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.\u201d\n\nClinton joked that the letter had been \u201cfound in the archives.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Unique communication style \u2013\n\nDemocrat Clinton, who was defeated by Republican Trump in the 2016 US election, has backed efforts to impeach him over his dealings with Ukraine and is still regularly targeted by the president during his speeches.\n\nIn the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, Kennedy and Khrushchev faced off in a moment of high diplomatic tension that threatened to tip the world into nuclear war.\n\nThe United States had detected Soviet missile installations in Cuba, just off the Florida coast, and Kennedy imposed a blockade of the island.\n\nSoviet ships laden with nuclear missiles heading for Cuba turned back at the last minute after a secret agreement with Washington.\n\nTrump has defended his diplomacy in the Middle East and his military pullout from northern Syria, which cleared the way for Turkey\u2019s cross-border attack against Kurdish forces.\n\nTrump\u2019s idiosyncratic communication style was also on display on Twitter Sunday when he misspelled the name of his Defense Secretary Mark Esper as \u201cEsperanto\u201d \u2014 the little-used universal language invented in 1887.\n\nHe corrected his error some hours later.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Hillary Clinton on Sunday posted a joke letter on Twitter supposedly sent by John F.
