So naturally, Seth Meyers wanted to bring a new angle to this news on Late Night by having one of these very important Trump whistle-blowers on his show, because which late-night host wouldn\u2019t want to chat with one of them directly? There\u2019s just one small problem though: Meyers\u2019s show didn\u2019t do its homework, so they ended up getting an appearance not by a Trump-Ukraine whistle-blower, but the whistle-blower who cracked open a completely different scandal at the Royal Oaks Community Garden, Mildred Mildew (Amber Ruffin). Sure, Mildred has a cousin who works at the White House and has shared some extremely interesting dirt about that other scandal in the news with her, but that\u2019s definitely not as important as the corruption behind what was once a lovely, wholesome competition among flower lovers! Thank you, Mildred, for your bravery.\n\nRelated", "description": "On NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night,\u201d Seth Meyers welcomes writer Amber Ruffin, who plays whistle-blower Mildred Mildew \u2014 not from the Trump-Ukraine scandal but the Royal Oaks Community Garden scandal.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/30/30-amber-whistleblower-seth-meyers.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
