With the Federal Reserve\u2019s Sept. 18 decision to reduce interest rates and analysts forecasting that a follow-up rate cut could occur later this year, investors could not be faulted for seeking the heightened yields offered by REITs.\n\n\u201cIn a yield-challenged environment, the closest thing to a Holy Grail for income investors is REITs,\u201d said Jim Woods, editor of Successful Investing, Intelligence Report and Bullseye Stock Trader. \u201cFor those who like the general REIT thesis, the Vanguard Real Estate ETF Shares (NYSE:VNQ) is a great way to play the sector.\u201d\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nCell Tower Company Is Among the REITs to Invest in Now\n\nFor investors who are willing to accept additional risk in hopes of achieving an outsized return, Woods said his favorite REIT is American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT). The company owns the land where many cellphone towers are located, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a growth play and an income play,\u201d Woods said.\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nRetirees May Be Enticed by REITS to Invest in Now\n\nBob Carlson, who heads the Retirement Watch advisory service, said retirees need more than income in their portfolios.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said for some time this is an ideal economic environment for real estate investment trusts, and Cohen & Steers Realty Shares (CSRSX) has been proving my point in 2019,\u201d said Carlson, who added he has owned CSRSX in his portfolio for a long time and will continue to hold it indefinitely.\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nIn Carlson\u2019s view, REITs are the ideal long-term investment, whether an investor already has retired or is planning for it. REITs have outperformed the S&P 500 over a long period and their lack of correlation with the stock index lets them earn positive returns when equities decline, as happened in the technology stock bust after 1999, he added.\n\n\u201cBy owning commercial real estate, REITs benefit from a growing economy,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThey do especially well in a slowly growing economy because there\u2019s less speculative overbuilding that causes rents and property values to collapse.\u201d\n\nREITs to Invest in Now Offer Inflation Protection\n\nREITs also provide inflation protection, because they are backed by real estate assets, Carlson said.\n\nCSRSX may be the oldest mutual fund dedicated to REITs and is among the top performers over almost all time periods, according to Morningstar. The fund has a process of identifying the economic cycle to determine which REIT sectors to own and others to avoid. Then, the fund focuses on REITs in the sectors that have quality properties and management, as well as sell at reasonable prices.\n\nThe fund recently held only 40 positions, Carlson said. Almost 55% of the portfolio was in the 10 largest positions, while the top sectors were infrastructure, apartments, self-storage, data centers and health care, he added.\n\nTop REITs to Invest in Now\n\nTop positions in CSRSX feature American Tower, Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX), Welltower (NYSE:WELL), UDR, Inc. (NYSE:UDR) and SBA Communications (NASDAQ: SBAC).\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nEven investors who are wary about the risk of investing in stocks may find REITs appealing, since they may rise when the market indexes fall.\n\nIncome-Oriented Investors Are Among REITS to Invest in Now\n\nIncome-oriented investors are \u201calways hungry\u201d for the sweet spot between reliability and yield, but in the current low-rate environment the priorities shift, said New York-based money manager Hilary Kramer, whose new 2-Day Trader service has notched 13 out of 14 profitable trades with an average return of 15.3 percent since its launch. The Fed has stated that it will not be satisfied until inflation is trending at 2 percent a year, so that becomes the minimum return needed by an investor simply to keep buying power constant, she added.\n\n\u201cSince everything in the Treasury market except for 30-year bonds pays less than 2 percent, you\u2019re effectively locking in a loss once the Fed gets its way,\u201d cautioned Kramer, who also leads the Value Authority, GameChangers, Turbo Trader, High Octane Trader and Inner Circle advisory services. \u201cSavings accounts can\u2019t keep up. Neither can most certificates of deposit. They\u2019re still reliable, but their very lack of variability becomes a drag.\u201d\n\nPaul Dykewicz interviews money manager Hilary Kramer.\n\nEven though Treasury debt is backed by the U.S. government and the risk of default is unlikely, investors won\u2019t make much money by purchasing those financial instruments, Kramer said. The least volatile stocks still carry a little more risk that the promise of reliable income will be broken, compared to U.S. government bonds, she added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why these investments are priced the way they are,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cYour money works harder when the higher yields you capture actually pay out. Right now, that\u2019s real estate, which pays 3.1 percent across the sector. Barring a real estate crash, these companies will keep paying dividends because they\u2019ll keep collecting rent, and their shareholders will stay ahead of the Fed\u2019s inflation target.\u201d\n\nInvestors who are earning that 3.1 percent and paying their bills may be interested in pursuing further yield, even if it requires taking a little more risk, Kramer said. Avoid any real estate companies that depend on a normal yield curve because it recently became inverted with rates for short-term debt topping rates for long-term debt, Kramer added.\n\n\u201cA lot of mortgage REITs don\u2019t own property or charge rent,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThey simply borrow cheap and buy higher-yield long-term loans, which can blow up fast when short-term borrowing costs more than what long-term loans pay. Many of these companies are available at effective yields above 10 percent because most investors believe those dividends won\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nREITs to Invest in Now Own Rent-Producing Assets\n\nWhen a company owns the property and not just a pile of loans, the yield curve becomes advantageous for investors, Kramer said. An example is the best senior living REITs, which suffered after a string of bankruptcies triggered by too much competition, she added.\n\n\u201cOmega Healthcare (NYSE:OHI) pays above 6 percent and will probably be able to sustain that yield for the foreseeable future,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cIf the landscape shifts, you\u2019ll have time to adjust and, in the meantime, you\u2019ll cash 6 percent a year.\u201d\n\nVentas (NYSE:VTR), HCP (NYSE:HCP) and Welltower (NYSE:WELL) all pay 4 percent, Kramer said. Investors can start collecting those income payments now and then come back in a year to review the outlook for those positions, she added.\n\nREITs to Invest in Now Include Restructured Office Properties\n\nOffice Properties (NASDAQ:OPI) just went through a huge restructuring and now pays 7.5 percent, Kramer said. That dividend is probably secure for at least the coming year, so that\u2019s a whole lot better than what one-year Treasury debt pays now.\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nInvestors can treat OPI as a one-year bond and allocate their money accordingly, Kramer said. In retail, the malls may be off limits for now but Vornado (NYSE:VNO) owns the most exclusive storefronts in New York City, she added.\n\n\u201cThose rents aren\u2019t going to crater in the next year, so lock in 4.5 percent now,\u201d Kramer suggested.\n\nChart courtesy of StockCharts.com\n\nKey threats to investors right now include negative interest rates in Europe, soaring government debt, trade wars, economic weakening and global conflicts rather than a specific economic disaster such as the Great Recession of December 2007 to June 2009. Since none of those risks seem likely to end soon, REITs offer a way to collect income and pursue capital appreciation.\n\nPaul Dykewicz, www.pauldykewicz.com, is an accomplished, award-winning journalist who has written for Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal, Investor\u2019s Business Daily, USA Today, the Journal of Commerce, Seeking Alpha, GuruFocus and other publications and websites.
