Cuomo, a well-known face for the TV network, is a cisgender man who has indicated he goes by he, him and his.\n\nWhile the journalist later apologized for the comment, it drew a loud and immediate response from critics \u2014 one of a handful of false notes on a night that could otherwise be considered historic, as what organizers called the first nationally televised presidential forum devoted to addressing LGBT issues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: My pronouns are she, her and hers.\n\n\n\nCHRIS CUOMO: Mine, too.\n\n\n\nHARRIS: Alright. pic.twitter.com/09gJ2pygjd \u2014 Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) October 11, 2019\n\nBut it was still one punctured by tensions and gaffes like Cuomo\u2019s \u2014 namely, on questions of gender identity, as transgender activists of color interrupted the candidates to charge that the event had shut out their voices.\n\nHarris\u2019s line as she stepped onstage drew both praise and accusations of pandering, as she does not usually mention her pronouns at debates or campaign events. Yet, most on social media saved their sharpest criticism for Cuomo, calling his comment tone-deaf and particularly inappropriate for the occasion, which had been organized by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign. Within minutes, members of the media and advocacy groups had blasted Cuomo\u2019s remark online.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s pronouns are not a punchline,\u201d the National Center for Lesbian Rights wrote on Twitter. \u201cIn a year where LGBTQ Americans are finally being recognized on the national Presidential stage, making jokes about gender pronouns is beneath your dignity. Please do better in the future.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCharlotte Clymer, a trans woman and the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s press secretary, said she didn\u2019t think Cuomo intended harm. \u201cBut that was really not a great look,\u201d Clymer said on Twitter.\n\nI think Chris Cuomo was going for what I'm sure he thought was a harmless joke and I don't think he intended harm, but that was really not a great look.#EqualityTownHall \u2014 Charlotte Clymer\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@cmclymer) October 11, 2019\n\nYUCK. @ChrisCuomo just made a joke that his pronouns are She/Her/Hers.\n\n\n\nBigotry isn\u2019t cute especially at an #EqualityTownHall. \u2014 Blair Imani (@BlairImani) October 11, 2019\n\nThe TV host, who is no stranger to seeing his controversial comments go viral, apologized less than an hour after making the gaffe. \u201cI am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nPLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. \u2014 Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019\n\nBut some still weren\u2019t having it. Angelica Ross, a black transgender actress who stars on the FX show \u201cPose,\u201d called upon the host to learn about the importance of pronouns from black and brown trans women.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAdmit what\u2019s behind this is YOUR ignorance,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou just showed you don\u2019t understand the importance of pronouns, so how do you confidently crown yourself an ally?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s commonplace to introduce one\u2019s pronouns in many LGBTQ circles, where appearance, gender identity and expression are far from binary. In a community whose lexicon is constantly shifting, the phrase is a recent one to enter mainstream television \u2014 let alone a political event featuring most of the major Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nHello, @ChrisCuomo. My pronouns are they, them, and their. It\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s what\u2019s correct when addressing me. You had one job tonight and what you did was mock so many trans and non-binary people, tuned in and not tuned in, whose rights and lives are at stake. \u2014 Dana White (@DanaVivianWhite) October 11, 2019\n\nHey, @ChrisCuomo, there's no amusing irony in people using pronouns different than their gender presentation. I present as a cis male, and go by any pronouns, including she/he/hers. You only exposed your lack of familiarity with us tonight.@CNN @HRC #LGBTQTownHall https://t.co/QZbL2bebmB \u2014 Protest Therapist (@ihategender) October 11, 2019\n\nKamala Harris declared her pronouns on such a major stage and she should be applauded but instead it was so disappointing for Chris Cuomo to mock it in that moment. #EqualityTownHall #PowerOfOurPride \u2014 GLAAD (@glaad) October 11, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s perhaps another sign of how LGBTQ issues have entered the mainstream this election cycle in an unprecedented fashion. At the town hall in Los Angeles, attendees in the audience asked nine Democratic candidates questions about HIV and AIDS, mental health care for LGBTQ youth and religious opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor generations, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender Americans have had to live and love in the shadows. We could be arrested, we could be imprisoned, locked up in institutions,\u201d said CNN host Anderson Cooper, an openly gay man, as he introduced the town hall. \u201cThe fight for equality is certainly not over.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBefore the audience, all nine candidates promised they would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and would reverse President Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people openly serving in the military.\n\nFor one candidate, the night was personal. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who came out as gay after serving in Afghanistan, spoke of coming out as a \u201ccivil war.\u201d Asked about the ban on blood donations from men who have sex with men, he said, \u201cMy blood\u2019s not welcome in this country \u2026 It\u2019s not based on science; it\u2019s based on prejudice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg, along with Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), marked the date of the town hall to release their respective agendas on LGBTQ issues. A fourth candidate, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, had published his plans to strengthen rights for gay and transgender people in June.\n\nAD\n\nThe town hall was also marked by a number of protests from transgender activists in the audience, who interrupted the candidates several times to point to the climbing number of murdered black trans women as well as what they said was a lack of space for their perspectives during the town hall.\n\nAs the mother of a trans son was posing a question to O\u2019Rourke, Blossom C. Brown, an actress and producer, walked up to grab the microphone from her.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCNN, you have erased black trans women for the last time. Black trans women are dying. Our lives matter,\u201d Brown said. \u201cNot one black trans woman has taken the mic tonight, no black trans man has taken the mic \u2026 That\u2019s how anti-blackness works. That\u2019s how erasure works.\u201d\n\nLoving how all of my Black trans and trans Latinx fam have showed up tonight at the #LGBTQTownHall despite the constant erasure, silencing, and policing of our concerns and existence. \u2014 Raquel Willis (@RaquelWillis_) October 11, 2019\n\nLater in the evening, when CNN correspondent Nia-Malika Henderson mispronounced trans singer-songwriter Shea Diamond\u2019s name, she likened altering a trans person\u2019s name to \u201cviolence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA spokesperson for CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.\n\nAshlee Marie Preston, a producer and commentator, said she was approached by the Human Rights Campaign and CNN to ask a question at the forum, preparing an inquiry about transgender travelers during airport searches. But when Preston was told she would not be asking a question at all, she decided not to attend the event.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI knew that I was just being brushed off,\u201d Preston told The Washington Post. She added that, especially following comments like Cuomo\u2019s, an interruption from Brown was necessary to bring visibility to black trans women and highlight the oppression they face within the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cI understand that sort of frustration of being on the outside, looking into a room that\u2019s claiming to bring you in,\u201d Preston said to The Post. \u201cThe same frustration she expressed in the same frustration we have at the community level: We\u2019re always being silenced. We\u2019re always being censored, and we\u2019re always being pushed to the bottom.\"\n\nAD", "description": "The town hall was the first time presidential candidates addressed LGBTQ issues on a national stage.", "authors": ["Teo Armus", "Reporter On The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Lc0dCu3GMnd_sI_Gke_5R0wIcs4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V3AEP4XL5AI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
