Gibson was the long-term partner of Margaret Atwood, and was with the novelist while she toured to promote her new book, The Testaments.\n\nAtwood said in a statement this afternoon that her family was \u201cdevastated by the loss of Graeme, our beloved father, grandfather, and spouse, but we are happy that he achieved the kind of swift exit he wanted and avoided the decline into further dementia that he feared\u201d.\n\nThe novelist, who had been with Gibson since the early 1970s, said he \u201chad a lovely last few weeks, and he went out on a high, surrounded by love, friendship and appreciation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for his wise, ethical and committed life,\u201d said the author, who is currently promoting her sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale but had cancelled events this week due to an \u201cunforeseen family illness\u201d. Gibson had dementia, but continued to travel with Atwood, who told Time magazine earlier this month that she had completed The Testaments while caring for him.\n\nGibson\u2019s publisher, Penguin Random House Canada, described him as \u201csuch a beloved and distinguished author\u201d and \u201ca friend to several generations of Canadian writers\u201d.\n\n\u201cHis influence on the lives of writers in this country has been profound and far-reaching. We are grateful for that superlative legacy, one that will continue to flourish, and also grateful for our own experiences working with Graeme: a true gentleman, whose gracious, elegant, and witty manner touched all who knew him,\u201d said chief executive, Kristin Cochrane.\n\nGibson\u2019s books included a miscellany of writings about birds, The Bedside Book of Birds, and The Bedside Book of Beasts, in which he wanted to \u201ccelebrate the deeply moving truth of creatures that are truly wild\u201d. He wrote novels including Five Legs, the stream-of-consciousness story of two guilt-ridden young men which, when published in 1969, was described by one reviewer as having \u201cmore potent writing in it, page for page, than any other young Canadian novel that I can think of\u201d.\n\nAn ornithologist and conservationist, he also co-founded the Writers\u2019 Trust of Canada and the Writers\u2019 Union of Canada, served as president of PEN Canada, and won awards including the Harbourfront Festival Prize and the Toronto Arts Award.\n\nAn interviewer once said that \u201cevery woman writer should be married to Graeme Gibson\u201d. Atwood told the Guardian in 2000 \u2013 in a profile which described Gibson as a man who \u201cexudes, bursts, beams with pride\u201d for his partner \u2013 that \u201cwe got that put on to a T-shirt for him, in fact\u201d.", "description": "Long-term partner of Margaret Atwood had dementia but continued to travel with her on book tour for The Testaments", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611d71212b3fb0542d5fa01d6d74757070692a5f/0_455_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b209b7d71f218a97e9aae2af93631ec", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
