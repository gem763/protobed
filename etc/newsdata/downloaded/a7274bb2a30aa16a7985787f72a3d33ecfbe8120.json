While many instances of disruption risk have turned into disruption reality, the risk premium remains elusive in the financial market,\" said commodity strategist Michael Tran.\n\n\"In the wake of major supply outages this year, some structural, others transient, we see a developing trend of the risk premium pricing instead into the physical market. In other words, if the financial market will not pay for it, the physical market will.\"\n\nHe said the firm's view was based more on market sentiment, than bearish fundamentals.\n\n\"To be clear, we are not necessarily expressing a bearish view on the market,\" he said.\n\n\"Instead, we question the market\u2019s ability to accurately reflect the fundamental backdrop when factors like the US president play an outsized role in shaping market sentiment.\"", "description": "The US's largest banks have had a better than expected third-quarter; Oz Minerals upgrades guidance for gold production in fiscal 2019; Challenger increases FUM.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9934%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7233357a4a0792c69540f6c4fe347082df25f602", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
