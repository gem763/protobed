Last season, I thought Emery was decent. Fifth, narrowly missed a Champions League place and lost the Europa League final. Not a disaster.\n\nThe club backed Emery to the hilt in the summer, as Mirror Sport reported in September, the Kroenkes stepped up and underwrote the spending, and this season he is expected to make top four because the squad is way, way better than many people make out.\n\nHowever, Emery is not necessarily making progress. What is his style? Pressing, counter attack, possession? No-one seems sure.\n\nHe has no connection with the fans through poor communication.\n\nThe players are not too sure either because Emery tends to shut himself away and they are divided on him.\n\nThe election of the captain, sharing duties has been done in Spain but it\u2019s utterly bizarre. And, in choosing Granit Xhaka, you are appointing a player who is not popular with the fans. That\u2019s risky. And so it\u2019s proved.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nNow Mesut Ozil is being held up by the fans as representative of what\u2019s gone wrong. Well, hang on a minute, he was getting pelters not so long back! Now he\u2019s a convenient stick to beat Emery with.\n\nI\u2019m not sure Emery is the answer. I felt they should have gone Mikel Arteta or Brendan Rodgers at the time. They\u2019d have been better.\n\nBut I think they\u2019ll stick with Emery while top four is achievable this season. If the season drops away, they\u2019ll probably act.\n\nBut I don\u2019t like fans booing their own players and I hope they don\u2019t start chanting against the manager. No-one can thrive in that atmosphere.\n\nNo wonder Xhaka reacted if he is getting booed. To hear ex-players slaughter him and play to the gallery is beyond parody. They\u2019d have gone crazy if they\u2019d been subbed and gone off to 50,000 people jeering them. Just imagine that for a moment.\n\nI never thought Emery was for the long term but it\u2019s top four or bust.\n\nDarren Lewis - No\n\nWe can't just sack managers after a bad day at the office. The Premier League is crazy enough as it is without knee-jerk decisions from clubs that would leave them open to a lack of patience.\n\nThat's not to say that Arsenal under Unai Emery are moving in the right direction. Defensively they still lack leadership and organisation. In midfield they still lack steel and Emery has yet to find a system that gets the very best out of his players. Right now he does not appear to be an improvement on Wenger.\n\nNicolas Pepe will likely go on to be a fine player but prioritising an offensive signing over a commanding central midfielder or defender - after all their problems last season - is a failure of the club's recruitment. That isn't just down to Emery.\n\nWhat is down to Emery is the decision-making that has seen him leave out Lucas Torreira and fail to get the best out of Matteo Guendouzi.\n\n(Image: WILL OLIVER/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nAs for Xhaka, he made a mistake. He is human and everyone has their breaking point. Fans are hammering him for swearing at them even though most of what he'd received from the stands would likely have been far worse.\n\nHe needs to apologise and speak about just how much the barracking is affecting him. Perhaps that will enable fans to show a little bit more sympathy towards him. Again, that said, he isn't without his faults and remains a mystery as to why Emery handed him the armband in the first place when Xhaka has been culpable for so many mistakes that have cost his team.\n\nArsenal's problems are fixable. However unconvincing Emery might be at the moment, he needs the time to fix them.\n\nMike Walters - No\n\nFire Unai Emery now? So who would Arsenal go out and bring in as his replacement at the drop of a hat?\n\nHe should be given until the end of the season to deliver improvement on his first campaign - when he reached a European final, to be fair.\n\nBut - and it's a big but - Emery is the man who installed Granit Xhaka as captain, via a bizarre dressing room poll of his players.\n\nEmery is the man who has decided to bin Mesut Ozil for the last six games, denying himself an option of creativity, even off the bench.\n\nAnd it's Emery who will carry the can if Arsenal do not achieve a top-four finish this season.\n\n(Image: ANDY RAIN/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nDavid Maddock - No\n\nOf course not. He's only been there a year and got Arsenal to a Euro final already. They're currently in fifth in the Premier League, with one of the most potent strike forces in the English game.\n\nThey are clearly a work in progress, and that progress has been slow at times, but Emery needs time to implement his philosophy and gameplan.\n\nWhat he has to do, of course, is sort out the Xhaka mess. He needs to be strong, and set the right tone in dealing with his captain. There may be no way back for Xhaka, but there certainly is a way back for Emery.\n\nRich Jones - Yes\n\nThere were positive signs in Emery's first season in charge, but, ultimately, he has failed to address the issues that lingered during Wenger's final years.\n\nProgress has been limited at best, and it is understandable frustration amongst the fan base is growing.\n\nThe struggles of Manchester United and Tottenham , plus the inexperience of Chelsea , make this the best opportunity Arsenal have had to work their way back into the top four.\n\nThe lucrative riches of the Champions League mean they cannot afford to miss out again. If they fall short, they run the risk of falling further behind those at the top of the tree.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nCurrently, the Gunners are not on track and recent performances seem to be showing regression rather than progress.\n\nNow is the perfect time for club bosses to act before it is too late and bring in a manager who can grind out the right results to get into the top four.\n\nWith a couple of months to learn about his squad before being able to invest in January, a new man at the helm could be exactly what Arsenal need to bring the best out of a squad with plenty of exciting attacking talent.\n\nNeil McLeman - Probably\n\nEmery took Arsenal to a European final and narrowly missed out on the Champions League in his first season.\n\nBut still it is hard to say what his philosophy is and how he has really changed Arsenal.\n\nHis treatment of Xhaka could be a telling moment. He was right to immediately say his captain was wrong and will consider his future role.\n\nAt least Xhaka showed a bit of passion. Emery and Arsenal does look like a loveless marriage.\n\n(Image: Visionhaus)\n\nJake Polden - No\n\nThe toxic haze that hung over the Emirates towards the end of Arsene Wenger's reign was lifted when Unai Emery was named his successor in 2018.\n\nThe Spaniard seemingly came out of nowhere, brushed Mikel Arteta to one side, and slammed a portfolio down on Ivan Gazidis' desk outlining how he was going to have the Gunners boot-scootin' back to the Champions League.\n\nEmery was exactly what an unhappy Arsenal needed at the time of his appointment; a breath of fresh air, a new lick of paint, and there was an immediate response that rejuvenated the players, coaching staff and most importantly, the fans.\n\nEveryone knew there would come a time when Emery hit a roadblock.\n\nA quick glance at Manchester United would prove a new boss taking over from a long-reining manager isn't destined to be rosy.\n\nAnd Emery has simply hit that road block now. So what do Arsenal do?\n\nWell, they could follow United's lead and begin hiring and firing or they can back their boss.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThere is a reason why Gazidis was blown away by Emery's CV - it's enviable. The Spaniard is a proven winner who knows how to get teams over the line.\n\nNo, Emery hasn't found a winning formula at the Emirates, with Robin van Persie recently pointing out that he believes players struggle to understand his broken English, but this is all part of the process.\n\nEmery's English will improve, Emery will sign more players in his mould, Emery will eventually implement his philosophy and, finally, Emery will find a winning formula.\n\nDarren Wells - No\n\nEmery isn't the problem and his project is still a work in progress, but Arsenal's inconsistency will certainly be a concern to him and the club's fans.\n\nIt comes back to the same old leadership issues that have dogged Arsenal in recent seasons.\n\nIf Xhaka is your captain and he's behaving like that, what does that say for the respect towards Emery and the paying supporters?\n\nYou need one or two big characters in the dressing room to put people in their place and lead by example, and you can't see those types of players among the current crop.\n\nBut he had the cash to go out and sign those players and opted not to.\n\nI don't think the Arsenal fans are sold on him either, and they should have seen the Palace result out after being two-up.\n\nThey're too flakey when the going gets tough, and unless Emery can knock that out of his team, their top four hopes will fall apart.\n\nShould he fail to achieve that he'll have to pay the price.\n\nLiam Cope - Not yet\n\nRemarkably, Arsenal sit fifth in the Premier League despite only a handful of convincing performances so far this season.\n\nThere's a lack of direction on the pitch stemming directly from Emery's tactics, and Arsenal's approach to games is worrying, with the attack lacking a real threat.\n\nMesut Ozil remains ostracised, which is presumably not helping the situation and doing even less for Emery's snowballing PR war with the fans.\n\nThe atmosphere around the club is reminiscent of the last few months of Arsene Wenger's reign.\n\nAnd Granit Xhaka's actions against Crystal Palace may have also been a swipe at Emery, as the captain didn't put much effort into shaking his hand as he left the pitch.\n\nFrom now until January Emery has a big task on his hands in getting the fans back on side; a good place to start would be improving performances on the pitch.\n\nThere are no excuses, Emery has a talented squad at his disposal. And if things don't improve by the end of the year then the board should let him go and find a replacement.", "description": "Fans are calling for Emery's head after Arsenal blew a two-goal lead to Crystal Palace - but is it time for him to go?", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa", "Will Oliver Epa-Efe Rex", "Andy Rain Epa-Efe Rex", "Visionhaus"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20742828.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Arsenal-v-Crystal-Palace.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
