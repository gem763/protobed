Later on Friday, Danno Ferrin, blockchain protocol engineer at ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, proposed activating Istanbul at block number 9,056,000 in accordance with the targeted date of Dec. 4.\n\n\u201cFrom when I calculated \u2026 at 14-second block times its 245,544.5 blocks, which puts noon UTC at block 9,055,928.5. So I would propose 9,056,000 as the Istanbul mainnet block target. Please check my math,\u201d Ferrin wrote after the meeting in an ethereum core developers chat room.\n\nRelated: 5 Takeaways on Ethereum 2.0 From Vitalik\u2019s \u2018Beast Mode\u2019 Blog Posts\n\nDuring the call, devs also agreed that in the case of any unexpected issues with the upgrade software between now and the week of Dec. 4, Istanbul\u2019s mainnet activation would be delayed one month to Jan. 8.\n\n\u201cThe thing about the [Jan.8] backstop date is that if we\u2019re going to ship and change the time, we have to build a new client \u2026 and get everyone to install the client,\u201d Ferrin said during the call. \u201cAt least four weeks for a re-spin is necessary.\u201d\n\nDuring the last system-wide upgrade, Constantinople, ethereum developers did indeed need to delay mainnet activation of the upgrade for a month due to a critical code vulnerability discovered just 48 hours before Constantinople\u2019s scheduled roll-out.\n\nThis time, ethereum core developers are covering all their bases with pre-determined backstop dates in the event of any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nRelated: WATCH: UNICEF\u2019s Crypto Fund Plans to Pay for Internet in Public Schools\n\nSaid Ethereum Foundation developer Piper Merriam:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that says [we can\u2019t launch] the first week of December. We\u2019re just setting some easy backstop dates now and we can always change our mind later if needed.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going into Istanbul?\n\nCome December, Istanbul is expected to introduce six backwards-incompatible code changes to the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain network.\n\nThe most controversial among them, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1884, will increase the computational costs of recalling data about the ethereum blockchain for application developers. At the same time, the increased fees will better safeguard the $18 billion platform from potential denial-of-service, or spam, attacks.\n\nThe other code changes introduce more pricing adjustments to the ethereum platform, as well as new code operations that application developers can leverage to verify and authenticate blockchain data more quickly.\n\nLast month, Istanbul was activated on ethereum test network Ropsten. Due to its premature timing, however, miners on the network initially faced difficulty rolling out the upgrade.\n\nTo prevent further confusion over which version of ethereum software to run for miners (the users who validate transactions and process new blocks on the network), ethereum core developers approved today a new code change called EIP 2124.\n\nFork IDs and fork coordinators\n\nOriginally proposed in May by ethereum core developers P\u00e9ter Szil\u00e1gyi and Felix Lange, EIP 2124 introduces a mechanism for users to easily identify what version of software a computer server, also called a node, in the ethereum network is running.\n\n\u201cGenerally, clients have a hard time following a non-majority chain so usually you have to tweak the clients [manually] \u2026 to make sure they\u2019re on the right chain.\u201d said Szil\u00e1gyi, adding:\n\n\u201cAll these issues can be fixed by including the fork ID.\u201d\n\nCalled the \u201cfork identifier,\u201d Szil\u00e1gyi explained on the call that EIP 2124 is a \u201ctiny and beyond trivial change.\u201d It can be rolled out by any ethereum software client without the need for coordination with other actors.\n\nOutside of this, James Hancock, project lead at ethereum startup ETHSignals who most notably tried to initiate a fork of the ethereum blockchain in June, announced that he was joining the Ethereum Foundation to help coordinate ethereum system-wide upgrades, also called hard forks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m joining the [Ethereum Foundation] to help with hard fork coordination,\u201d said Hancock. \u201cFor me, I want to focus on getting EIPs ready rather than focus on when are we going to release [an upgrade]. \u2026 It\u2019s about changing the attitude from how many forks are we going to have this year to getting EIPs ready [for a fork].\u201d\n\nEthereum image via CoinDesk archives\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "Ethereum\u2019s next system-wide upgrade, Istanbul, is scheduled to arrive on mainnet the week of Dec. 4.", "authors": ["Christine Kim"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Jn4sZP0z6b93bzI_0meh.g--~B/aD0xMTI1O3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/35c2833a4af8e32eea8c15f556b3c073", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
