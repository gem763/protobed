Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to erase all student debt and make public universities tuition-free. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Ma.) wants to eliminate tuition at public universities and wipe out most student loan debt.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s plan, released Tuesday morning, aims neither to make all public universities free nor eliminate student debt. But his campaign insists his plan is just as big.\n\n\u201cWe reject any premise this plan is not equally bold as those plans,\u201d said a senior campaign official on the phone with reporters. \u201cThe Biden plan reflects the vice president\u2019s and Dr. [Jill] Biden\u2019s deep commitment to making sure every child in this country can pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree or community college.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s plan focuses on improving access to community college and making all college more affordable for needy students. The Biden family has a strong connection to community college: His wife, Jill, who has a doctorate in education, has spent much of her career teaching in one.\n\n\u201cThey work so hard and ask for only one thing in return: opportunity,\u201d Jill Biden said on the call.\n\nJoe Biden's higher education plan is based on making community colleges tuition-free.

Beyond tuition, qualifying students could use Pell grants and state aid to cover the rest of their expenses, according to the plan.\n\nMuch of Biden\u2019s vision for higher education builds on what he started with former President Barack Obama, according to campaign officials. The Obama administration proposed tuition-free community college in 2015.\n\nHowever, Biden\u2019s plan also includes a number of measures that would also help students complete their degrees. He proposes a grant that would help community colleges create an emergency fund for students undergoing unexpected financial hardships.\n\nThe plan also includes an $8 billion investment in community college facilities.\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal seeks to make a dent in college debt, albeit one that is specific and targeted to individuals making below a certain amount of money.\n\nBiden says he would double the maximum value of Pell grants \u2015 a grant for low-income students that does not need to be repaid. Under a Biden presidency, people making less than $25,000 a year wouldn\u2019t have to make loan repayments or accrue interest, though everyone else would have to pay 5% of their discretionary income.\n\nIn contrast, Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s student debt plans are far more expansive. Sanders has announced his intention to cancel nearly all student loan debt, regardless of a debtors\u2019 income. Warren would eliminate a portion of debt for every household making below $250,000.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan also includes major investments in historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, and other minority-serving institutions, including $18 billion in grants and $20 billion for infrastructure.\n\n\u201cStudent debt both exacerbates and results from [the] racial wealth gap,\u201d according to the plan.\n\nLove HuffPost?
