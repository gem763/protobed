Both have a small amount of breast tissue behind the nipple and areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple),\u201d the charity states.\n\n\u201cThis is made up of a few tiny tubes (ducts) surrounded by fatty tissue, connective tissue, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, around 390 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK in comparison to 54,800 women.\n\nMen who are between the ages of 60 and 70 are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease.\n\nThe most common symptom for breast cancer that men need to look out for is a lump in the breast tissue that can be felt close to, or surrounding, the nipple.\n\nAdditional signs of breast cancer can include liquid discharge; a nipple that\u2019s inverted or feels sensitive; swelling in the chest area; ulcers in the chest or nipple area; or lymph nodes in the armpit area, Breast Cancer Care states.\n\nYou can find more information on male breast cancer, including how to check for symptoms, at His Breast Cancer, an organisation that raises awareness about the disease.", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s father, Mathew Knowles, has announced he is battling breast cancer.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/07/beyonce-mathew-knowles.jpg"}
