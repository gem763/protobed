Bush at Cowboys Game", "language": "en", "text": "Talk show host and comedian Ellen DeGeneres pushed back against criticism from her largely progressive fanbase after being photographed alongside her friend and former President George W. Bush at an NFL game.\n\nDuring her monologue on Monday, Ellen DeGeneres responded to criticism across social media over a viral photo of her sitting next to George Bush and his wife Laura at a Dallas Cowboys game on Sunday, revealing that she had been invited to the game by Charlotte Jones, the daughter of the team\u2019s owner Jerry Jones.\n\nIncredible duo watching the Cowboys game: W and @TheEllenShow pic.twitter.com/ufFb0NUlrF \u2014 Matt Gorman (@mattsgorman) October 6, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen we were invited, I was aware that I was going to be surrounded with people from very different views and beliefs. And I\u2019m not talking about politics\u2026 I was rooting for the Packers,\u201d DeGeneres joked. \u201cSo I had to hide my cheese hat in Portia\u2019s purse.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were upset,\u201d DeGeneres admitted. \u201cThey thought, why is a gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president?\u2026 A lot of people were mad. And they did what people do when they\u2019re mad\u2026 they tweet.\u201d\n\nYes, that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend. Here\u2019s the whole story. pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 8, 2019\n\nThe comedian went on to make the case for bridging America\u2019s sharp political divide by insisting that she was friends with people from all walks of life, whatever their political beliefs.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m friends with George Bush. In fact, I\u2019m friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d DeGeneres explained. \u201cWe\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s okay that we\u2019re all different\u2026 but just because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Be kind to one another,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean only the people that think the same way that you do,\u201d she continued. \u201cI mean be kind to everyone. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nAlthough the extent of the pair\u2019s somewhat unlikely friendship remains unclear, it is believed to have started when Bush appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2017.\n\nDuring the interview, Bush made similar comments about friendships crossing the political divide in reference to a photo of him hugging Michelle Obama at the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\n\u201cThat surprised everybody,\u201d Bush said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s what so weird about society today, that people on opposite sides of the political spectrum could actually like each other.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Talk show host and comedian Ellen DeGeneres pushed back against criticism from her largely progressive fanbase after being photographed alongside her friend and former President George W.
