It does not do anything to try and change behaviour and tackle the problem of racism and discrimination by Bulgarian fans.\n\n\u2018Bulgarian football has been infiltrated by far-right groups who use the stadiums to spread their message of hate. The Bulgarian FA\u2019s response has virtually been non-existent, and you can see that with this leaflet, which is not even being distributed outside the ground prior to the match.\n\n\u2018We have been trying to work with the Bulgarian FA to do more positive things, but they are not interested. They have not even responded to our letters.\u2019\n\nAn estimated 3,400 England fans are expected in Sofia tonight but for once, it is not their behaviour that will be under the spotlight.\n\nBulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov said this week that English football has a worse racism problem\n\nThere have been around a dozen high profile racist incidents within Bulgarian football over the past 18 months with fans abusing black players or unfurling discriminatory or Nazi banners. During last year\u2019s Bulgarian cup final, one young boy was seen giving Nazi salutes while another was displaying a swastika across his chest.\n\nThere will be a number of Fare representatives amongst home fans at tonight\u2019s game to monitor and report any incidents of racism.\n\nAlong with other campaigners, the organisation has demanded the issuing of banning orders for those found guilty of racist or discriminatory behaviour and a concerted drive by the Bulgarian FA to educate and engage with fans.\n\nMr Klymenko: \u2018We do not even have the provision of banning orders within Bulgarian football. Even when the perpetrators are identified they continue to attend matches. The question is, is the will there within the Bulgarian FA to do anything about racism and discrimination within their game?\u2019\n\nThe last time England played in Sofia in 2011, the home nation was sanctioned by UEFA following racist chanting by its fans.\n\nA spokesman for the Bulgarian FA denied Fare\u2019s claims and said that it had been working hard to prevent racist abuse at tonight\u2019s match and overall within its national game.\n\nHristo Zapryanov told MailOnline that more than 2,000 leaflets had been distributed and that signs will also be in place at the stadium warning spectators of \u2018proper conduct.\u2019\n\nBulgaria FA chief Borislav Mihaylov complained to UEFA about England's growing concerns\n\nHe also revealed that all stewards and police have been issued with strict instructions to eject any fans involved in racial or discriminatory behaviour.\n\nMr Zapryanov added: \u2018They will be arrested and dealt with according to Bulgarian law. Everyone is aware of the fact that the England group is extremely sensitive to this issue following problems in previous games.\u2019\n\nThe concerns of England players over racism tonight have been heightened by the response of Bulgarian officials, who have either played down the issue or pretended it does not exist within their game.\n\nAhead of the Euro 2020 qualifier, Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov accused English football of having a bigger racism problem than his own country.\n\nHe said: \u2018In the Bulgarian championship, we have a lot of players of different ethnicities and skin colour. I don't think that we have this big problem like, for example, England do.'\n\nAsked to elaborate, Balakov added: \u2018What I meant was that in the Bulgarian championship we've not had such problems while there have been incidents in various levels of English football involving racism, which I consider something normal because it's a big country with a very diverse population.\n\n'But we don't have this problem in Bulgaria, I can assure you of that.\u2019\n\nBorislav Mihaylov, the President of the Bulgarian FA also wrote a letter of complaint to UEFA accusing England of \u2018offensive, unjust\u2019 and \u2018derogatory\u2019 comments about Bulgarian fans.\n\nThis was in response to England manager Gareth Southgate suggesting that he feared the worst in terms of possible racist abuse from the stands in Sofia, while the Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham said the players were prepared to walk off in the face of it.", "description": "The leaflet was distributed to supporters clubs of the Bulgarian national team ahead of the match, which has been overshadowed by concerns over the potential racist behaviour of home fans.", "authors": ["Vivek Chaudhary For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/18/19703856-0-image-a-11_1571074153809.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
