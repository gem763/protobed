But in the manufacturing sector, employers eliminated jobs.\n\nThe Labor Department said Friday that manufacturers shed 2,000 jobs last month, adding to concerns about the sector.

Hundreds of companies have requested exemptions from the increases, warning that associated costs and uncertainty could hurt employment plans.\n\n\"Continuing to add tariffs to these necessary accessory products is not protective of U.S. manufacturers, and, in fact, would cause significant harm to the U.S. sink business that Elkay has fought so hard to protect, including the potential loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs,\" Elkay Manufacturing Company wrote in its exemption request.\n\nNow read: Ray Dalio warns the White House's latest plan to clamp down on Chinese investment could soon become a reality.
