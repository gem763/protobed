I love spooky season as much as the next person, but when I online shop, I don't want any tricks, just treats. After all, nothing will haunt you more than knowing you bought a product at full price, when you could've saved a ton of money on it elsewhere.\n\nBut that's why I'm here: to scope out the best deals on the internet, so you don't have to. Today, I've found some sales on Amazon that should certainly lift your spirits, pun intended, including discounts on Vitamix blenders, our favorite vacuum cleaners, and more. So go ahead and trick-or-treat yourself to the five best deals on Amazon this Saturday, so you can stop reading my corny Halloween puns.\n\n1. Lowest price ever: Our favorite affordable blender\n\nBlend your way through smoothies and more with this top blender. (Photo: Vitamix)\n\nWhether you want to whip up a morning smoothie, make some thick vegetable soups, or blend up nut butters, salsas, or batters, this popular Vitamix blender can do it all, and right now, you can save a whopping $160 on it and get it for the lowest price we've ever seen. We chose it as our favorite affordable pick when we tested the best professional blenders this year, as we loved its powerful motor and lower height that fits underneath cabinets. While these are astronomically expensive to buy new, it's way more common to buy one of Vitamix's certified reconditioned models, which work just the same. They also come with a five-year warranty and an Amazon renewed guarantee.\n\nGet the Vitamix 5300 Certified Refurbished blender for $199.95 (Save $159.05)\n\n2.

(Photo: Bissell)\n\nVacuuming is one of the most tedious and tiresome chores, but it has to be done if you want to keep your floors free of dust bunnies, dirt, and debris. While devices like robot vacuums can be a huge help, you're going to need a traditional vacuum for those deeper cleans.

While already affordable as is, right now you can shave $10 off its price tag and get it for just $89.96.\n\nGet the Bissell Cleanview Vacuum Cleaner for $89.96 (Save $10.03)\n\n4. 10% off: One of our favorite sound machines\n\nDrown out the outside world and fall asleep easier with the LectroFan.

If you're trying to drown out the sound of the neighbor's crying baby or barking dog, or perhaps just the city noise from your apartment window, one of our favorite sound machines\u2014the Adaptive Sound LectroFan\u2014can be a huge help.
