The temple denied the accusations.\n\nGovernment officials could not be reached for comment on Sunday.", "description": "More than half of the tigers that Thai authorities confiscated in 2016 from an infamous Tiger Temple tourist attraction have died from a viral disease because their immune systems were weakened by inbreeding, media reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430046640&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E057", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
