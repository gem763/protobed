I am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\"\n\nTo raucous applause, he declared: \"I am back.\"\n\nIt was the start of what he is calling a \"vigorous\" return to campaigning as he tries to give his stagnant bid an instant shot of energy.\n\nAmong those who introduced Sanders from the stage was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders' latest high-profile endorsement.\n\nSanders had emergency heart surgery this month but insists that he's more committed than ever to the 2020 race. With the first voting contests less than four months away, he has some work to do.\n\nBeyond health concerns, Sanders suddenly finds himself looking up at progressive rival Elizabeth Warren and establishment favorite Joe Biden in the polls. Now he must reassure voters that he has the physical stamina to go forward while addressing broader concerns that his policies may be too far left to defeat Trump in a general election.\n\nThe endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, the 30-year-old high-profile progressive, \"sends the message that the movement is growing, that it's gaining influence, that it's gaining traction,\" Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir said.\n\nWhile Sanders pledged during this week's presidential debate to move forward with a \"vigorous\" campaign, he's moving cautiously in the short term. The rally in Queens was his only scheduled appearance before he returns to Iowa late next week.", "description": "Among those who introduced Sanders was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, his latest high-profile endorsement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/19/fba7189ca0b549938fe8ffb4abbfa3eb_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
