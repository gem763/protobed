If I repeat this to the community members I will be killed and if I go the police station, I will be arrested,\" he said in his statement.\n\n\"\u2026 I also thought of my age that I am very old to go to prison and die there.\"\n\nAfter wandering around, he thought he should dispose of her body before it started decomposing as he was \"afraid\" of being arrested.\n\nHe admitted to police that he cut up her body, put the parts in black bags and dumped it across different parts of Khayelitsha.\n\nInvestigating officer Constable Vuyani Phinzi told the court on Tuesday that Nobade had pointed out the areas where he recalled having dumped the body parts.\n\nAt a reedy area which was burnt, they retrieved a plastic bag containing a head and thigh.\n\nState forensic pathologist Jill Roman testified on Tuesday that she was tasked with examining a decomposing head and 47cm long femur bone.\n\nThe parts were found in a bag along with a black cloth, white doily material, a watch as well as a pink scarf and a pair of panties.\n\nLooking at the relatively clean-cut edges, she believed a medium or large knife was used to sever the parts, although a smaller knife would have sufficed if the severing was done in layers.\n\nIt would have taken a significant amount of force to sever or separate the bone, she said.\n\nShe had been unable to determine the cause of death.\n\nJudge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe asked why she believed someone would dump body parts in separate areas.\n\nThe pathologist replied that those involved generally did not want the parts to be found or they wanted to conceal the cause of death.\n\nThe court heard that Nobade also took officers to an area behind BM section but divers couldn\u2019t find anything in the water.\n\n\"He pointed out that he threw the arms in that riverlet\u2026 the parts probably flowed away so they could not be retrieved,\" said Phinzi.\n\nAt another area near Baden Powell Drive, he pointed to a reedy area but divers were again unable to retrieve anything.\n\nPhinzi said it was possible that dogs and pigs in the area could have eaten the body parts.\n\nAfter his wife's death, Nobade travelled across the country, telling people that his wife had not returned from a funeral in De Doorns.\n\nHe was eventually arrested in Johannesburg in May 2017.\n\nProsecutor Megan Blows said Nobade claimed his wife assaulted and abused him, not the other way around.\n\nPhinzi replied that there was no record of him laying a charge against his wife, nor evidence of officers being called out to attend to a domestic violence case.\n\nDefence lawyer Office Mtini said his client went with his son to the police station in November 2016 to report that his wife had assaulted them.\n\n\"I cannot deny that but I do not have a record of that,\" said Phinzi.\n\nThe trial is due to resume on Wednesday.", "description": "A Khayelitsha man accused of murdering his wife claims she died while he was defending himself in an argument and he panicked.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8922/6ebf1d0bb2ee4931bacde5564b3699b2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-05-28"}
