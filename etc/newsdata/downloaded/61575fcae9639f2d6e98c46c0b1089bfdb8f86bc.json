Gharib is believed to have helped capture fleeing demonstrators and detain them in the prison headed by Raslan.\n\nRaslan left Syria in late 2012 and arrived in Germany in July 2014, while Gharib left in February 2013 and entered the country in April 2018, prosecutors said.\n\nThey are currently in custody.\n\n\"Brutal force\"\n\nProsecutors outlined a system of brutal interrogations of opposition members including a variety of torture methods including \"blows with fists, truncheons, pipes, cables, whips and hoses as well as electric shocks\".\n\nPrisoners were also suspended from the ceiling by their wrists and beaten, sexually assaulted, deprived of sleep and threatened with harming their loved ones.\n\n\"The systematically brutal physical and psychological mistreatment served to force confessions and extract information about the opposition movement,\" prosecutors said.\n\nThe ECCHR, which supports Syrian torture survivors as co-plaintiffs in legal proceedings, said 14 witnesses had participated in the German investigation.\n\nThe Syria conflict began in March 2011 with a series of mass protests demanding civil liberties, prompting repression by the regime which quickly began using \"brutal force\" against protesters, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The Syrian secret services played an essential role in this,\" the statement added.\n\nMore than 360,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict with millions more displaced.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 60,000 people have died from torture or harsh conditions in regime custody since the conflict began.\n\nOther cases loom\n\nAlthough the alleged abuses did not happen in Germany, the case has been filed under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows any country to pursue perpetrators regardless of where the crime was committed.\n\nSeveral other legal cases are now pending against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Germany.\n\nThe ECCHR joined with torture survivors to file criminal complaints against 10 high-ranking Syrian officials, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nLast year, German prosecutors issued an international arrest warrant for Jamil Hassan, a top Syrian official who headed the notorious airforce intelligence directorate and is accused of overseeing the torture and murder of hundreds of detainees.\n\n\u201cThese charges send an important message to survivors of Assad\u2019s system of torture,\u201d said Wolfgang Kaleck, General Secretary of the ECCHR.\n\n\u201cWe will continue working to ensure that the main perpetrators of torture under Assad are brought to justice \u2013 in Germany or another European country.\u201d", "description": "Human rights activists applauded as Germany charged two alleged former Syrian secret service officers with participating in crimes against humanity,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/76/70/1000x563_cmsv2_438a6f22-f387-56aa-9e0b-19db35d08067-4267670.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
