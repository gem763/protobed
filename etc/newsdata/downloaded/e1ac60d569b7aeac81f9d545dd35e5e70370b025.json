(Votisor)\n\nEven though Yashvardhan can\u2019t vote, he wanted to create something that could help improve voter turnout, especially among young voters.\n\n\u201cI think decisions are better made when everyone's voice is heard,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that's especially important for youth \u2026 because voter turnout among young voters is especially low.\u201d\n\nIn the 2015 election, 57.1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 cast ballots, up from 38.8 per cent in 2011, according to Elections Canada.\n\nOne of the key features is also information on candidates.\n\nUsers can find out who is running in their riding and even get their contact information.\n\n\u201cI think the local representative really represents your interests in Parliament. So it's really important for people to not only know who the federal party leaders are and what their policies are, but also to see who their local candidates are,\u201d Yashvardhan said.\n\nYashvardhan Mulki has created four apps and received scholarships to attend the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. (Submitted by Yashvardhan Mulki)\n\nOne of his key priorities in developing the app was keeping the content unbiased.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure it's as nonpartisan as possible and represents the information fairly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe app chooses information from \u201creally reputable news sources in Canada.\u201d\n\nThe articles are chosen based on keywords related to the election, but are not in chronological order.\n\nVotisor has been downloaded about 520 times and is available on the App Store.", "description": "Yashvardhan Mulki, 16, created a voting app to help Canadians stay informed on the federal election campaign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/TeenVotingApp_thumbnail_v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
