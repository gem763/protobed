Gavin Newsom (D) has declared a statewide emergency as fires rage on both ends of the state. The Kincade Fire had already burned more than 54,000 acres \u2014 roughly the size of Baltimore \u2014 as of Sunday night, according to Cal Fire, which said just the fire is just 5 percent contained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt least two firefighters have suffered injuries since the blaze began late Wednesday night in Geyserville, roughly 75 miles northwest of San Francisco. At least 94 structures have been destroyed, including the historic Soda Rock Winery near Highway 128.\n\nAll 40 of Sonoma County\u2019s public schools will be closed Monday and Tuesday, affecting more than 70,400 students. Meanwhile, 1.3 million Californians in the Bay Area are without power as state utility giant Pacific Gas & Electric implemented a historically large blackout to mitigate the risk of additional fires as high winds whip around the tinder-dry region.\n\nPG&E also cut gas service to more than 20,000 customers \u201cto protect homes from fire,\u201d Sonoma County officials said.\n\nNearly 3,400 personnel are fighting the massive wildfire, and they will contend with a mix of weather conditions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay region \u2014 particularly the North Bay, which includes Sonoma County \u2014 a relentless 36-hour period of howling, desiccating winds will come to a temporary end on Monday by 11 a.m. local time. \u201cRed flag\u201d warnings are in place until that time for most of the Bay Area, for \u201ccritical\u201d fire weather that could allow wildfires to spread rapidly and exhibit extreme behavior that would make them hard to control.\n\nThe air mass over this region is at record dry levels for this time of year, and abundant vegetation following a wet winter is also extremely dry, which primes the environment for fires.\n\nThe Bay Area won\u2019t catch much of a break after Monday, however. The National Weather Service is forecasting another around of \u201cstrong, gusty, and dry offshore winds\u201d beginning midday Tuesday and lasting into Wednesday morning, and it\u2019s likely that the red flag warnings will be hoisted yet again by Monday afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis looming event would be the third major \u201cDiablo wind\u201d event in seven days, something Weather Service forecasters in the region said they \u201chave no memory of\u201d occurring before. Typically these events are more spread out over time. With the next event, winds are expected to be highest in the North and East Bay hills, where gusts up to 65 mph are possible.\n\nA chief concern among forecasters and emergency officials is whether the fire will jump across Highway 101 and, according to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cignite an area that hasn\u2019t burned since the 1940s.\u201d\n\nThe mass evacuations proved controversial in some of the areas further from the fire. On Sunday, Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said he was \u201c100 percent convinced\u201d he made the right call in ordering the mandatory evacuations Saturday and Sunday, according to the Press- Democrat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can understand why someone in Bodega Bay is saying, \u2018C\u2019mon. What are you guys doing?\u2019 I don\u2019t take these decisions lightly,\u201d Essick said. \u201d I look at October 2017 and I still get emotional about this because I was there. \u2026 We lost 24 lives.\u201d\n\nThe 2017 Tubbs Fire in Sonoma, Napa and Lake counties killed at least 22 people and was one of the most destructive blazes in state history, incinerating more than 5,000 properties \u2014 many of them homes in Santa Rosa \u2014 and causing more than $1.2 billion in damage.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The wind-driven fire in Northern California has burned an area roughly the size of Baltimore.", "authors": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ze0PAAR8hs12MOLkhNrJBzrKSmY=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-27-2019/t_ce850e6d7985467ba400c2ecd9fba33a_name_fire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
