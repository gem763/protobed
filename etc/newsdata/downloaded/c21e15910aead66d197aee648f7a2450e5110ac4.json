REUTERS/Andreas Gebert\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Angela Merkel\u2019s preferred successor as chancellor, said she would discuss the initiative with NATO partners this week and did not rule out sending German soldiers to Syria, saying that would be a matter for parliament.\n\nTurkey meanwhile said it would resume its offensive against Kurdish fighters in Syria\u2019s north when a ceasefire expires on Tuesday evening because hundreds of them remain near the border despite the deal\u2019s requirement for them to withdraw.\n\nAs Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan met in Sochi for talks on the conflict in Syria, Kramp-Karrenbauer made clear her initiative would need acceptance from those countries.\n\nThe Kremlin said it was studying the idea, which caused irritation within Germany\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) who are in coalition with Merkel\u2019s conservatives but were not consulted.\n\n\u201cWe cannot just stand by and watch and not do anything,\u201d Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), told Germany\u2019s ZDF television late on Monday.\n\n\u201cMy suggestion is that we set up an internationally controlled security zone involving Turkey and Russia,\u201d she told Deutsche Welle broadcaster.\n\nShe said the move should stabilize the region and allow civilians to rebuild and refugees to return on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe five-day, U.S.-brokered pause in Turkey\u2019s military operation against the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria is due to expire at 1900 GMT on Tuesday.\n\nNATO-member Turkey wants all YPG forces to leave a \u201csafe zone\u201d it wants to establish along a section of its border with Syria. Ankara views the YPG as terrorists with links to Kurdish insurgents operating in southeast Turkey.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s idea is a departure for Germany, which is still a reluctant partner in security missions abroad, above all in the Middle East, due to the legacy of World War Two though it has increased its involvement in the last two decades.\n\nIRRITATION\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer, seeking to boost her credentials as the CDU\u2019s candidate for chancellor in a 2021 election, said she had liaised closely with Merkel on the idea.\n\nShe quickly won backing from party allies including Norbert Roettgen, head of parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee who said the proposal was \u201cbrave and worthy of support\u201d.\n\nHowever, the proposal raised tension in Merkel\u2019s coalition as the SPD is wary of foreign military commitments.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer also raised eyebrows by saying she had been in touch with SPD Foreign Minister Heiko Maas by text message and, in an unusually direct riposte, Maas said he did not think much of text message diplomacy.\n\nHe echoed scepticism voiced by several other SPD lawmakers and said he needed more details, such as what role German soldiers would play, before making any assessment. But he stopped short of ruling out the plan altogether and stressed Germany would continue to be involved in seeking a diplomatic solution for Syria and in providing humanitarian aid.\n\nThe plan won support from Germany\u2019s notable Kurdish community, angry about Turkey\u2019s assault on northeastern Syria, following a U.S. troop pullback, that has sent thousands of Kurds in the region fleeing. Kurds make up about a third of the roughly 3 million people with Turkish roots in Germany.", "description": "Germany's defense minister has suggested creating a security zone in northern Syria to protect displaced civilians and ensure the fight continues against Islamic State militants, the first time Berlin has proposed a military mission in the Middle East.", "authors": ["Michael Nienaber", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443748244&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K1PU", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
