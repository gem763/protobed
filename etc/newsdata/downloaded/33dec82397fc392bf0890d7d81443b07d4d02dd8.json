The whistleblower\u2019s complaint, citing \u201cmultiple White House officials with direct knowledge\u201d of the matter, said Trump used the call \u201cto advance his personal interests,\u201d thus abusing his office.\n\nWallace, a moderate voice who often punctures Fox News\u2019 routinely favorable coverage of Trump, stressed that the complaint \u201cis a serious allegation,\u201d much of which \u201chas proven to be borne out already.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo dismiss this as a political hack ... seems to me to be an effort by the president\u2019s defenders to make nothing out of something, and there is something here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wait and see what\u2019s there, but it is a credible complaint, the [acting] Director of National Intelligence Joe Maguire said that it is credible and should be taken seriously. And I guess that\u2019s all I\u2019m really saying is that for all of the efforts of a lot of people the president to pretend this is nothing \u2015 it isn\u2019t nothing, it\u2019s something.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, as Maguire testified before Congress about the complaint, both The Washington Post and The New York Times ran reports emphasizing the White House\u2019s alleged attempt to cover up the Ukraine call while Fox News had a headline: \u201cMaguire Under Fire \u2015 Trump intel boss cautions impeachment-driven Dems: Complaint based on \u2018second-hand information.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe network\u2019s prime time opinion hosts, such as Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity have \u2015 without evidence \u2015 painted the whistleblower as a left-winger who represents a national security threat.", "description": "The anchor called out Trump allies for dismissing the \"very damaging\" whistleblower complaint about the president's dealings with Ukraine.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e3d9e210000fa025fd565.jpeg?cache=4yhvjtakn3&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
