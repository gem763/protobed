On to him comes Jale Vatubua...\n\nAnd then like a master matador Mieres whips the red cape away from the charging bull, riding the horns to pass to Juan Manuel Cat, who lasers a pass to Rodrigo Silva.\n\nSilva puts the foot down to gas Filipo Nakosi, weaving back inside and drawing the last defender before releasing a simply superb offload past the opposite armpit for Cat, who gleefully trots in. Outstanding.\n\n4. George North (Wales) vs Georgia\n\nThis one is all about the dancing from Tomos Williams. Footwork to make you swoon.\n\nWilliams calls his shot, pointing down the touchline at the Georgian defenders and inviting them to tango. They oblige, and Williams spins them aside, right-foot step, duck beneath the left hook to beat two defenders in a phone booth.\n\nHe throws in another exaggerated step off the right to suck in three Georgian defenders, and pops the ball over the fence for George North to sashay onwards.\n\nHis left-foot jab is surreptitious compared to Williams' flamenco footwork, but enough to shift the point of contact and keep North's large legs moving forward with momentum, and through the attempted tackle of Georgia's replacement loosehead to score.\n\nEight defenders beaten in one five-metre channel. Lovely stuff.\n\n3. George Bridge (New Zealand) vs South Africa\n\nWe know not what is to come at this World Cup, but in time this try may be looked back on as the one that set New Zealand on their way to a third consecutive World Cup victory.\n\nAt the time, the All Blacks were struggling, brains and hands scrambled by the brutal blitz defence of the Springboks, desperately trying to force the ball wide but failing to do so, error after error as they let South Africa assert their ascendancy.\n\nAnd then along came this moment of majesty.\n\nAn aerial win gives New Zealand broken field ball, with South Africa's wide defence for once unstructured and indecisive. Richie Mo'unga spots Makazole Mapimpi too far infield, and jabs a little cross kick to give Sevu Reece the ball.\n\nReece's hitch-kick is devastating, a quick heel-toe motion to slow and then rapidly accelerate, leaving Mapimpi, by no means a slow man, clutching at thin air.\n\nArdie Savea provides excellent support and with typically powerful leg drive moves inside the 22. Aaron Smith spots space to the left, Beauden Barrett is perceptive to the huffing and puffing inside defence and finds a gap, and George Bridge takes the offload to cross for the try.\n\nA special movement to transform the contest. Scott Barrett's follow-up was a little special, too.\n\n2. Api Ratuniyarawa (Fiji) vs Georgia\n\nA gem. An absolute gem.\n\nRight from the restart, Fiji cut Georgia to pieces, with typically irreverent flair and devastating ability in open space.\n\nLeone Nakarawa juggles the kick-off and then up goes the periscope as two defenders bite in on the lock. His over-the-top offload tumbles into the hands of Semi Radradra, who surges infield and gets one out the back door to Frank Lomani.\n\nLomani puts on the hip wiggle, movement to charm even the most combative of cobras and weaving delightfully around a stumbling Beka Gorgadze, throwing in an extra step off the left boot for good measure.\n\nAnother offload, and over lumbers replacement lock Api Ratuniyawara. 75 metres covered in 15 seconds, pace, precision, power, potency, perfection.\n\n1. TJ Perenara (New Zealand) vs Namibia\n\nAbsurdly good. Utterly scandalous stuff from the All Blacks, particularly given they were down to 14 at this point in the game, with a scrum-half playing at ten and their starting fly-half on the wing.\n\nPerenara, the nine-cum-ten, sparks it with a scythe through the fatiguing Namibian drift defence, and a vicious right foot step to get to the outside of the defender.\n\nHis offload to wing George Bridge from the floor is ridiculous, defying the laws of physics to produce a blind spin pass from his weaker hand WHILST ON THE FLOOR to hit Bridge in stride.\n\nBridge takes contact and Rieko Ioane picks and goes to continue the momentum, offloading to Brad Weber in support.\n\nAnd then Weber gives them the ol\u2019 razzle-dazzle with a ludicrous round-the-back offload, nary a glance to check for the presence of that man Perenara.\n\nThe try hasn\u2019t even peaked yet. Perenara is released by Weber\u2019s magic but has two defenders closing and little space to work with down the touchline.\n\nYet somehow the Hurricanes man contorts his body to miraculously wriggle into the corner, keeping his legs infield as Helarius Kisting drags him out, and slamming the ball down in the slightest sliver of space to score the try.\n\nStick it in the Louvre and make it a compulsory part of the national curriculum \u2013 tries do not come any better.", "description": "5.
