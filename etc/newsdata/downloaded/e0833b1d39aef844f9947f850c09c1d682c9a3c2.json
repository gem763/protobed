Giuliani, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper issued the ruling in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by American Oversight, a left-leaning government watchdog organization.\n\nThe judge said lawyers for the group and State Department must meet to narrow the scope of the document request and publicly release those documents in 30 days.\n\nJudge Cooper said he could not think of a third-party exception that would block the release of communications between Mr. Giuliani and State Department officials.\n\nThe government said it does not know how many records could be released because of the ruling. Officials said there are thousands of documents referencing Mr. Giuliani and former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled earlier this year, but some of those could be duplicates.\n\nAmerican Oversight filed the lawsuit earlier this month. Austin Evers, the group\u2019s executive director, described Judge Cooper\u2019s ruling as \u201ca crack in the administration\u2019s stone wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis emails, text messages \u2014 which he showed on TV \u2014 are going to be subject to public disclosure with limited redactions,\u201d Mr. Evers told reporters after the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that this administration will jump through some legal hoops to try to withhold them, but we have the court today urging the parties to focus on those communications as top priority.\u201d\n\nThe ruling comes on the same day House Democrats upped their demand for State Department documents.\n\nThe chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees, which are spearheading the impeachment inquiry, are looking to obtain key documents, including text messages from witnesses and memos regarding Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThese documents include information central to the inquiry\u2019s core area of investigation: the President\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine to initiate investigations that would benefit his personal and political interest, not the national interests,\u201d the chairmen wrote.\n\n\u2022 Gabriella Munoz contributed to this article, which is based in part on wire-service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
