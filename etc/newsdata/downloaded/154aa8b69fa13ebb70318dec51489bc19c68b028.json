Sign up here.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s Twitter-centric approach to foreign policy has sown utter confusion in northern Syria, following a blitz of erratic messaging in which he appeared to greenlight a Turkish assault on an ally, before threatening Turkey if it went \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s threat, Turkey announced on Tuesday it had finished its preparations for a military incursion in northeast Syria against Kurdish forces it considers to be terrorists. As U.S. troops began withdrawing from observation posts near the Turkish border, America\u2019s Kurdish partners were left bracing for a Turkish assault, while Republicans slammed the president for undermining U.S. efforts in the fight against ISIS and abandoning a stalwart ally.\n\nTurkey rattled by Trump threat\n\nTrump\u2019s unexpected announcement late Sunday, that U.S. forces would leave the border region to clear the way for a Turkish offensive was a bombshell to Kurds, and prompted a furious backlash from Republicans. The rebuke from his own party prompted Trump to threaten Turkey via Twitter Monday that he would \u201cobliterate\u201d its economy if it went \u201coff limits\u201d in its offensive.\n\nEge Se\u00e7kin, senior analyst at IHS Markit, told VICE News that the broad Republican condemnation of the withdrawal, coupled with Trump\u2019s threat, could drive Turkey to show restraint in its offensive.\n\n\u201cTurkey may wait a couple of days for the dust to settle in Washington,\u201d said Se\u00e7kin, adding that Trump\u2019s threat had a \u201csobering effect\u201d on Turkish decision-makers.\n\n\u201cEven Lindsey Graham \u2014 viewed in Turkey as sympathetic to Turkey\u2019s concerns \u2014 joined the chorus in criticizing Trump\u2019s decision.\u201d\n\nErratic signaling\n\nTrump threw U.S. policy in Syria into chaos with the sudden announcement late Sunday, following a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that U.S. forces in northern Syria were going to leave \u201cthe immediate area\u201d ahead of a long-planned Turkish incursion.\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s pullout from northern Syria is a disaster for the Kurds and a gift to ISIS\n\nThe announcement, followed by Trump\u2019s statements that it was \u201ctime for us to get out\u201d and let others \u201cfigure the situation out\u201d prompted widespread fears the U.S. was going to completely withdraw from Syria and abandon the Kurds, who the U.S. has backed as a vital military partner in the fight against ISIS.\n\nBut amid a fierce backlash to the statement, including from some of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies, U.S. officials scrambled to insist that Trump had not greenlit a Turkish invasion.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement that the U.S. did not endorse a Turkish invasion, and had warned Turkey that any unilateral action would cause risks. And a Trump administration official said the drawdown would not be a withdrawal of the 1,000 U.S. troops deployed in Syria, but would see 50 U.S. troops in the border region targeted by Turkey redeployed elsewhere in Syria \u201cwhere they aren\u2019t in the crossfire.\u201d\n\nThen, late Monday, in an apparent response to the torrent of criticism, Trump himself pivoted by tweeting an explicit threat to Turkey warning it to show restraint.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!),\u201d he tweeted. Last year, the U.S. raised tariffs on Turkish metals, weakening the ailing Turkish lira.\n\nBut, said Se\u00e7kin, there was \u201cno transparency on what \u2018limits\u2019 President Trump actually agreed on with Erdogan, or whether they spoke of any limits at all.\u201d Asked to expand on his \u201coff limits\u201d comment, Trump said Turkey should \u201cnot do anything outside of what we would think is humane.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s threat to Turkey made no reference to its treatment of the Kurds. But on Tuesday he tweeted that \u201cin no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.\u201d\n\nKurds fear attack is imminent\n\nAmid the confusion, major questions remain about how far the Turkish operation will extend \u2014 or be allowed by the U.S. to extend \u2014 into northern Syria. Se\u00e7kin said it was not clear whether Turkey would be satisfied with seizing territory around the Kurdish-held border city of Tal Abyad, for example, and whether the U.S. would apply pressure to Ankara not to extend the operation further.\n\n\u201cWe cannot say for sure yet if this signifies the wholesale abandonment by the U.S. of the Kurds,\u201d said Se\u00e7kin.\n\nKurdish forces, who described Trump\u2019s initial announcement was a \u201cstab in the back,\u201d said that they were expecting an imminent attack as Turkish forces and their proxies mobilized. With Erdogan endorsing a plan to resettle the border area with millions of Syrian refugees currently sheltering in Turkey, the Kurds fear a widespread demographic displacement. But one senior Kurdish official, Badran Jia Kurd, told the Washington Post he hoped that support from the U.S. would somehow survive Trump\u2019s statements.\n\nTrump has vowed twice before to pull out of Syria, but has faced domestic opposition to a total withdrawal, resulting in 1,000 remaining in the country pending a negotiated end to the conflict.\n\nTrump\u2019s erratic messaging over Syria has also left U.S. troops in the dark, according to Brett McGurk, the U.S.\u2019s Special Presidential Envoy to the global coalition against ISIS from 2015 until last year.\n\n\"We have people on the ground tonight who are [in Syria] under President Trump's orders and they really have no idea what they're supposed to do,\u201d he told MSNBC Monday. \u201cThat is just unacceptable if you're the Commander-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nCover: Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump, right, shake hands during a meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Saturday, June 29, 2019.
