ONOMO Hotels is a wholly African brand, owned by Africans and only operating on the African continent.\n\nREAD: These hotel room hacks are so obvious but they will change your travel game forever\n\nThe tenth floor at Signature Lux Foreshore by ONOMO.

In Rwanda, for example, they're one of the only hotels where all their department heads are Rwandan.\n\nBut they're not exactly new kids on the block - this year they are celebrating a decade of African hospitality, started in the Senegalese city of Dakar in West Africa. Since then, from Casablanca to Cape Town, they have expanded throughout West and Central Africa, and are now turning their attention to Southern and Eastern Africa.\n\nWATCH: What it takes to open a hotel according to a seasoned GM\n\nONOMO CEO Cedric Guilleminot and COO Souleymane Khol. (Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nThey want to connect the dots across the continent and become a stalwart African brand - but this doesn't come without challenges. Civil war, unrest and safety have had an impact, but they grew through all these risks and realities by being prepared for these developmental challenges, according to CEO Cedric Guilleminot.\n\n\"We don't flip properties - we are here to build hotels and teams.\"\n\nIn South Africa, they already have five properties - three in Cape Town, one in Durban and one in Johannesburg, with new hotels opening in Mozambique's Maputo and Tanzania's Dar Es Salaam by the end of the year. At the end of 2019 they will have a total of 21 hotels across Africa, and aim to have 33 hotels by the end of 2022.\n\nALSO WATCH: Taste of Radisson: The hotel group that loves to feed you\n\nThe lobby of Signature Lux Foreshore by ONOMO.

While Foreshore is focused on business travellers, the other two are in prime tourist locations.\n\nRight on the edge of Battery Park, Signature Lux Waterfront offers amazing value for the price, and ONOMO's Inn at the Square is located in one of Cape Town's oldest buildings which will be undergoing a facelift in March 2020.\n\nREAD: Passion sets SA hospitality industry apart from the rest of the world, says this Croatian GM\n\nThe basketball court in Battery Park.

Purified water also comes straight out of the tap for drinking, taking another hit against plastic bottles.\n\nPICS: This is what the first space hotel will look like\n\nThe view of the old Gothic church from ONOMO Inn at the Square hotel.

They offer self-check-in, including using your phone as a keycard for guests arriving late in the night. On their TVs, besides your usual perusal of channels, you'll also be able to check flight schedules, MyCiti bus schedules or even the weather. They also have an app that lets you manage your stay, including ordering hotel toiletries if you've forgotten yours.\n\nAnd when it comes to food, local South African flavour dominates the menus, and even if you're not a guest a stop at one of their hotel restaurants is a must.\n\nREAD: The biggest, the oldest and the smallest: Guinness World Records list record-breaking hotels\n\nRisotto balls from Vivaldi Restaurant.
