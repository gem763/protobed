gathering illegally and police said rioters had launched petrol bombs and damaged a subway station, AP reports.\n\nThe rallies in Kowloon and a small, peaceful gathering of retirees who shouted at plainclothes police officers outside police headquarters on Hong Kong Island maintained pressure on Ms Lam, to bend to the months-long protest movement\u2019s demands ahead of her annual policy address on Wednesday.\n\nHong Kong has been paralysed by the unprecedented protests calling for democracy and against police brutality.\n\nThe former British colony was returned to China in 1997 and promised broad autonomy for 50 years under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model. But many in Hong Kong accuse Beijing of eroding its freedoms.\n\nMr Cruz said he stood in support of those protesting.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

A rally in a shopping mall pulled together about 300 people who sang and put up protest posters.\n\nThe majority of protesters wore masks over their mouths in defiance of a week-old ban that makes face coverings punishable by one year in jail when worn at rallies.\n\nThe police force reported on its Facebook page that rioters tossed petrol bombs inside a Kowloon subway station, \u201cposing a threat to the safety of citizens\u201d but causing no injuries.\n\nOverall, however, the protests were lower-key and appeared to lack the numbers of some much larger demonstrations seen during the more than four months of unrest that have gripped the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, according to AP.\n\nAs recently as last Sunday, tens of thousands of masked protesters had hit Hong Kong\u2019s rain-drenched streets.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report", "description": "Against a backdrop of further violent protests, Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam has scrapped talks with US senator Ted Cruz after her office requested the meeting be kept completely confidential, the American politician has said.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/12/16/Hong-Kong-protests.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
