And it will cost a cool 95,000 euros, or about $105,000, to spend a single night at the northernmost hotel in the world.\n\nLuxury Action offers high-end experiences such as an authentic Finnish Christmas Adventure in a remote Lapland chalet for around $14,000 a week, or a $26,800 custom-designed \u201cHollywood Experience\u201d that lets guests star in their own movie.\n\nRelated: Now a few lucky women can travel to this all-female island for networking and wellness\n\nBut it boasts that its North Pole Igloos are \u201cthe most exclusive travel destinations on Earth.\u201d The six-figure price tag covers one night in one of 10 heated igloos (made of glass, not ice) in April 2020, a month-long travel window when adventurers can fly to the North Pole safely by helicopter. (The Geographic North Pole is also accessible by ship in June and July.) Guests are guaranteed to see the Northern Lights at this time of year, as well, which they can spy from their beds, since the roof and walls of the igloos are made of glass to fully immerse them in nature.\n\nLuxury Action\n\nThere is also an en-suit bathroom for each dome, as well as an on-site camp manager, an Arctic wilderness guide, a chef and a security team included in the package.\n\nThe price also covers a two-night stay in Svalbard, Norway and a two-hour helicopter ride to the North Pole ice camp. Plus, the travel agency provides all of the equipment needed to stay safe in a place where temperatures plummet to negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and a high of just 32 degrees Fahrenheit (the freezing point of water) in the summer.\n\nRelated: Oscar Mayer Wienermobile is now an Airbnb lodging option in Chicago\n\nLuxury Action founder Janne Honkanen told MarketWatch by email that customers had been requesting more information about ways to explore the Arctic. \u201cI thought that this is the time and the opportunity to give a chance for my guests to experience the North Pole with Arctic explorers and scientists in a safe way,\u201d said Honkanen. \u201cYou can join the group of very rare people who have spent a night at the North Pole\u2019s glacier.\u201d\n\nLuxury Action\n\nIt\u2019s also an opportunity to show people firsthand what\u2019s at risk as climate change melts the polar ice caps and displaces wildlife. \u201cAll our guests who have been traveling with us, take concern of the Arctic nature and climate crisis,\u201d said Honkanen. \u201cI believe they are also the best messengers for us in order to spread word of how climate change affects our lives in the Arctic, as well as what are the effects on our Arctic animals and nature.\u201d", "description": "The price tag covers a heated dome with an en suite toilet, chef and security team in April 2020.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR446_NorthP_ZG_20190917103845.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
