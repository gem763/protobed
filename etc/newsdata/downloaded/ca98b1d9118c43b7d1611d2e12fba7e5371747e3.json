Facing impeachment, Trump latches on to his sidekick", "language": "en", "text": "The out-of-the-blue reference triggered questions about the vice president\u2019s role in the latest mess and the unusual relationship between the pair of leaders. If Trump falls alone, Pence becomes the 46th president of the United States \u2014 a development many mainstream Republicans would prefer. If Trump and Pence go down together or in quick succession, it\u2019s President Nancy Pelosi \u2014 a prospect that would not be lost on Senate Republicans voting on whether to oust their party\u2019s leaders.\n\nTrump\u2019s offhand remark was a stark reminder of the eternal risks to the people in his orbit, particularly as the notoriously unpredictable president navigates the delicate politics of impeachment.\n\nResponding to a question about the president\u2019s U.N. news conference , Tom LoBianco, author of the new Pence book \u201cPiety and Power,\u201d asked , \u201cYou mean when he gutted Pence on live TV?\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\n\u201cHe tends to flash this paranoia every now and then that Pence is after the job ,\" LoBianco said. \"It\u2019s like joking not - joking. But I was shocked that he was so out in the open this time . \u201d\n\nPence allies say there\u2019s no reason to think the president will toss his No. 2 under the bus \u2014 something Trump has done to past advisers, Cabinet secretaries and White House aides.\n\n\u201cTrump is very loyal to people who have been loyal to him,\u201d former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) said. \u201cYou look back where there\u2019s been separations, and it\u2019s often where someone has gone off in a different policy direction and been public about it.\u201d\n\nSome people close to Pence, who spoke with POLITICO on the condition of anonymity, saw the president\u2019s recent comment as nothing more than Trump\u2019s typical stream of consciousness \u2014 an innocent statement meant to convey that neither he nor the vice president are guilty of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s largely above reproach. No one ever accuses the vice president of doing anything like that,\u201d said one person close to Pence, referring to the allegations at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe president was trying to put himself on the same ground as that,\u201d this person said.\n\nA senior administration official dismissed the notion that Trump would throw Pence under the bus if he ever sensed disloyalty. \u201cThat is silly. It\u2019s the opposite, meaning that [Pence's] calls are fine, too,\u201d the official said of Trump's latest remark. \u201cThink this through: POTUS and VP are gone and Pelosi becomes president? Please.\u201d\n\nThe past several weeks have been a minefield of loyalty tests for Pence, culminating with the whistleblower complaint that prompted Pelosi to embrace impeachment after months of cautioning her progressive colleagues not to rush toward it.\n\nPence met with Zelensky on Sept. 1 during a last-minute trip to Poland. He told reporters afterward he did not mention Biden during their conversation but did communicate his \u201cgreat concerns about issues of corruption\u201d in Ukraine. The vice president was not a participant on the July 25 call between the president and Zelensky, according to a senior administration official, who pushed back against a report saying he urged Trump not to release a transcript of the conversation earlier this week.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\nBefore the Ukraine scandal burst into public view, Pence was recovering from a series of other controversies that put his allegiance to Trump on full display.\n\nOn Sept. 9, the president claimed he had nothing to do with Pence\u2019s stay at a Trump-owned property in Doonbeg, Ireland, far away from meetings the vice president had planned in Dublin. Trump\u2019s denial of involvement in the arrangement contradicted a prior explanation provided by Pence chief of staff Marc Short, who said the president had suggested his resort as an overnight accommodation. When Short and Pence later said the vice president made the decision on his own \u2014 because of his family ties to Doonbeg \u2014 it was widely seen as an attempt to rescue Trump from accusations of emoluments clause violations.\n\nThat same afternoon, Pence and his team found themselves in cleanup mode again. This time, the vice president pushed back on reports that he had disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision to invite Taliban leaders and the president of Afghanistan to Camp David for a secret round of peace negotiations.\n\n\u201cMore Fake News!\u201d Pence tweeted in distinctly Trumpian prose.\n\nPence\u2019s reaction was consistent with how those in his inner circle expect him to behave as the impeachment inquiry unfolds on Capitol Hill: with a mix of caution and chameleonic performances that endear him to the president.\n\nIndeed, Pence\u2019s first public defense of the president amid reports of the whistleblower complaint came in a fiery interview Monday night on Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity\u201d \u2014 a prime -time program Trump watches religiously.\n\n\u201cHere we go again. The assume-the-worst media takes one report, runs with it. Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately start to denounce the president before anybody has the facts,\u201d the vice president said .\n\nPence also came to Trump\u2019s defense on Wednesday in a series of statements from his official Twitter account that landed right as the president was calling attention to his conversations with Ukrainian officials. Quoting from an interview he did with Fox Business Network\u2019s Lou Dobbs, the vice president \u2014 who was n't at Trump\u2019s news conference in New York \u2014 denounced Democrats\u2019 \u201creckless accusations.\u201d He also repeated the president\u2019s erroneous claim that Biden threatened to withhold U.S. aid from Ukraine if a prosecutor \u2014 whom Trump has falsely claimed was investigating Hunter Biden \u2014 weren't removed from his position.\n\n\u201cThe vice president is just as solid and loyal as he can get,\u201d DeMint said. \u201cHe is just very thoughtful and strategic and over the next few weeks, he will be the president\u2019s top adviser.\u201d\n\nThe co-dependency between Trump and Pence has long been demonstrated by their policy portfolios, their synchronized talking points and the role both men play in energizing their MAGA base. Trump, a political neophyte with major character flaws in the eyes of his most ardent evangelical supporters, has allowed his vice president, a devout Christian, to assume powerful roles on foreign policy, health care and religious freedom. As long as Pence remains his dutiful deputy and greatest defender, he gains an automatic head start for his own presidential ambitions in the post-Trump era.\n\n\u201cHe would never take out Trump because if you are ever seen trying to kill the king, you lose the base,\u201d LoBianco said.\n\nBut even after three years of Pence\u2019s obedience and non stop flattery, there have been signs that Trump is unwilling to reciprocate the same degree of loyalty.\n\nEarlier this summer, the president began soliciting advice from close friends on whether Pence should remain his running mate in 2020 amid reports that he was facing pressure from his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, to swap out the vice president for a female running mate.\n\nAnd when Trump was pressed in a June \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview to endorse Pence as his natural successor, he attempted to dodge the question.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s \u2014 I love Mike ; we are running again . You\u2019re talking about a long time, so you can\u2019t put in that position,\u201d Trump said, adding he was merely willing to give it \u201cvery strong consideration.\u201d\n\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2d/fd/4343438741febd9e99a5b4bca560/19928-pence-trump2-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
