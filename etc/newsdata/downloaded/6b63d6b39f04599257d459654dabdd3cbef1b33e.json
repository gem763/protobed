I\u2019m in a leather trench coat and two layers under that in Georgia in the summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s no joke, man.\u2019\n\nA rose between two thorns: Ryan with Jeffrey Dean Morgan (L) and Norman Reedus (R) (Picture: Lisa O\u2019Connor/AFP/Getty)\n\nAnd there was us thinking navigating the Circle Line in the summer was bad\u2026\n\nWith Season 10 kicking off earlier in October, fans have been eagerly searching the new episodes for clues of what on earth\u2019s to come this series.\n\nAnd some eagle-eyed viewers struck gold, as they spotted a nice little Rick Grimes Easter Egg worked into the opening credits, which details key moments from the show so far.\n\nWith our injured hero Rick (Andrew Lincoln) bowing out five episodes into the show\u2019s ninth series by staring down a horde of undead on a bridge that was built to unite the communities, this scene is remembered in the show\u2019s titles.\n\nIn the illustration, a figure stands on one end of the bridge with a gun raised at the walkers as they make their way towards him. Shortly afterwards, the same bridge is up in flames and completely destroyed in the centre, preventing anything from getting across.\n\nThis is likely in reference to the moment Rick fires his gun at a stack of dynamite, killing the walkers and \u2013 seemingly \u2013 himself to the dismay of the rest of the survivors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Walking Dead airs Sundays on AMC in the US and follows a day later at 9pm on Fox UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
