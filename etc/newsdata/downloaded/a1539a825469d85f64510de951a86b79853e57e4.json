It closed above the open after a 2 day selloff. It is therefore a buy signal bar for today. However, it was a doji day, which is a weak buy signal bar. Also, it is in the middle of its 5 week range so the context is not strong for the start of a trend.\n\nBut the ledge at the top of the 5 week trading range is a strong magnet above. A ledge top is 4 or more bars with almost exactly the same high. Consequently, the odds favor at least a brief bull breakout. Therefore, the odds favor higher prices over the next week.\n\nIt is important to remember what I have said several times over the past few weeks. Even though a move above 2944.25 is likely, there is still better than a 50% chance of a reversal down from failed breakout. Traders should still expect a move to below 2800 unless the bulls get 2 or more closes above the month-long trading range.\n\nOvernight Emini Globex trading\n\nThe Emini is up 26 points in the Globex session. There will probably be a big gap up. There is only a 20% chance of either a bull or bear trend from the open when there is a big gap up.\n\nA big gap up typically leads to a trading range for the 1st 1 \u2013 2 hours. The bulls will look to buy a double bottom or wedge bottom near the EMA. However, the bears want a double top or wedge top and a swing down.\n\nI have been saying that traders should expect a breakout above the 2944.25 ledge top. The Emini is currently only 12 points below. Consequently, the bulls will probably get their breakout today or tomorrow.\n\nYesterday\u2019s setups\n\nE-mini 5 Min Chart\n\nHere are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.\n\nMy goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Al Brooks covering: .
