Kamala Harris, for one, took advantage. Welcome to On Media.\n\n\"THE SENATOR TOOK THE LEAD, and so she created an exchange with him,\u201d NBC News chairman Andrew Lack told POLITICO in the spin room following the debate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLack said the NBC team \u201cexpected that exchange\u201d given Harris\u2019s earlier criticism of Biden\u2019s comments, but they \u201cdidn\u2019t know how, when, precisely what the character of it would be.\u201d And, he added, \u201cit was a mystery to us what [Biden] was going to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a truck with 15 screens, and I\u2019m looking at the two of them, and we\u2019re directing shots, and the important piece for us just to give them a chance to speak to each other in the way that they did,\u201d Lack said. \u201cAnd it was quite compelling.\u201d\n\nMore from my post-debate piece is here.\n\nA box of popcorn sits next to reporters as they watch Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on a monitor inside the spin room during the first Democratic presidential primary debate on June 26, 2019 in Miami, Florida. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nMORE THAN 15 MILLION VIEWERS watched Wednesday night\u2019s debate across NBC, MSNBC, and Telemundo, an impressive number that came just shy of the record-setting first Democratic debate of the 2016 cycle. (The first Republican debate last time around drew a whopping 24 million.)\n\nDNC chairman Tom Perez was clearly pleased with the ratings. When I asked him about 15 million tuning in, he responded that there were 24 million. (Indeed, NBC says 9 million watched via live stream.) Perez said the party's energy hasn't abated from the women's marches to the midterms to the 2020 primary. \"People understand that democracy is not a spectator sport,\" he said.\n\nThe first night, which only included one top-polling candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has been expected to draw smaller ratings. Some campaigns were told that NBC\u2019s decision on which group of 10 went first was to \u201cmaximize viewership.\u201d We should find out this afternoon if night two comes out on top.\n\nFormer Maryland congressman John Delaney speaks to the media in the spin room following the first night of the Democratic presidential debate on June 26, 2019 in Miami, Florida. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nIF CANDIDATES CALLED THE SHOTS: \u201cI don\u2019t think I got enough opportunities,\u201d former Maryland Rep. John Delaney told me of his time on stage Wednesday night. \u201cI think that was probably obvious by me trying to wedge in as much as I could.\u201d\n\nWhat would he do differently? \u201cI\u2019d have 10 questions and every candidate would have to answer them and they would rotate and you\u2019d have 45 seconds,\u201d Delaney said.\n\nWashington governor Jay Inslee told me there should be \u201ca debate dedicated to climate change\u201d because a few questions in each of 12 debates isn't sufficient. \u201cIf we really want to understand how to mobilize the entire United States...we need a full debate,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, former Rep.
