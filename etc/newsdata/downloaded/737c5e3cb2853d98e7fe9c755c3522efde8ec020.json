One of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest oilfields in Hijra Khurais and the world\u2019s biggest crude processing facility at Abqaiq wasattacked by 10 drones, on Sep 14, per CNBC. Iran is being blamed by the United States for carrying out such devastation (read: ETFs to Win as Saudi's New Minister May Seek Same Oil Policy).\n\nThe instant reaction to the oil price was huge. \u201cBrent prices grew more than 19% on ICE Futures Europe to $71.95 a barrel, its biggest gain in percentage terms since 1991. Trading in WTI was frozen for a few minutes because of a so-called circuit breaker, which is triggered by a gain of more than 7%. When they finally opened, futures jumped as much as 15.5% to $63.34, the most since 2008,\u201d per Bloomberg.\n\nThough the longer-term impact of the attack depends on how long production is disturbed, we can expect oil prices to remain elevated as of now. Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels took the responsibility for the attack on the Saudi Aramco facility. The incident caused cessation of production of 5.7 million barrels of crude a day, \u201cmore than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s global daily exports and more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily crude oil production.\u201d\n\nRoberto Friedlander, Seaport Global\u2019s head of energy trading, expects oil to gain $10 per barrel, depending on the timing of a turnaround, as quoted on CNBC. And if Saudi resumes production sooner than expected, \u201cthe impact is more likely to be $3-5 to Crude,\u201d Friedlander added.\n\nHow to Profit?\n\nIf you are a believer of a prolonged extension of supply disruption, you can definitely invest in regular and leveraged oil or energy exchange-traded products for gains, at least for the short term.\n\nLeveraged ETFs in Focus\n\nProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (UCO) provides a leveraged play to the crude oil segment of the commodities market. It seeks to deliver twice the return of the daily performance of the Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex, which consists of futures contracts on crude oil (read: How to Trade Oil Rush With These ETFs).\n\nDirexion Daily S&P Oil&Gas Exploration & Production Bull 3X ETF GUSH gives three times exposure to the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index.\n\nDirexion Daily Energy Bull 3X ETF (ERX) offers three times exposure to the Energy Select Sector Index.\n\nProShares UltraPro 3x Crude Oil ETF OILU seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to three times the daily performance of the Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex.\n\nProShares Ultra Oil & Gas (DIG) offers two times the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Oil & Gas Index.\n\nProShares UltraPro 3x Short Crude Oil ETF OILD seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to three times the inverse of the daily performance of the Bloomberg WTI Crude Oil Subindex.\n\nAny Caution?\n\nAs a caveat, investors should note that such products are suitable only for short-term traders as these are rebalanced on a daily basis (see: all Leveraged Equity ETFs here).\n\nClearly, a near-term long could be intriguing for those with high-risk tolerance, and a belief that the \u201ctrend is the friend\u201d in this corner of the investing world. This is especially true given the news that Saudi Arabia intends to bring back a third of the lost output on Sep 16, per Wall Street Journal. So, a prolonged long-term surge from this attack is less likely.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.
