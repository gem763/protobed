All we could have done, and we did it, is get the commitments from a lot of players. So with that kind of a hand, you feel reasonably confident that you're going to be able to put a very good representative team on the court.\u201d\n\nWithdrawals were the story for Team USA\n\nThe FIBA World Cup is far from the radar of most basketball fans, but it kept creeping into the news because week after week, another NBA star would remove his name from consideration to play for Team USA.\n\nFirst, it was Anthony Davis pulling out on July 15. Days later it was James Harden and Bradley Beal. And before long, players like Eric Gordon, Paul Millsap and Montrezl Harrell opted not to compete.\n\nAfter starting with a roster full of 35 stars, the only players to remain on the 12-man roster were Kemba Walker, Khris Middleton, Harrison Barnes and Myles Turner. Eventually Team USA had to fill out its rotation with role players who come off the bench in the NBA like Mason Plumlee and Derrick White.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe players did everything they can do,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cThey are a good group of guys. But we went in with higher expectations in terms of roster and it didn't kind of happen the way we were hopeful and anticipating and expecting. That, to me, was a big disappointment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that several key players had to withdraw because of injuries, which is hard to blame on them. Kyle Lowry battled a thumb injury and Kyle Kuzma suffered an ankle injury, but Team USA should still have been more than equipped to win the tournament. International basketball has greatly improved this century, but no other country had more than five NBA players on it, other than the US.\n\nTeam USA managing director Jerry Colangelo expressed his dismay with player turnout. (Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images)\n\nWould Colangelo actually leave off some stars?\n\nThe good news for USA Basketball after the FIBA World Cup is that because they will finish second among countries from the Americas, they\u2019ve already qualified for the 2020 Olympics. No need to compete in more qualifying tournaments.\n\nAnd Colangelo and Co. should have a greater pool of players to pick from. There\u2019s little glory in the FIBA World Cup, especially after a long postseason, but players since 2004 have shown a willingness to log more miles in pursuit of a gold medal.\n\nThe question becomes whether Colangelo is serious about remembering \u201cwho you thought you were going to war with and who didn't show up.\u201d Stating the obvious, service to your country through basketball is very different from, you know, actual war, and Colangelo would be cutting off his nose to spite his face by uninviting NBA stars who sat out the FIBA World Cup.\n\n\u201cGoing forward for USA Basketball, we're going to need the cooperation of teams, agents, and then there has to be communication with players one-on-one to solidify those commitments,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cI am going to be anxious to see how many players reach out early to indicate that they wish and want and desire to play.\u201d\n\nHow Team USA handles its roster next year will be crucial to avoiding embarrassment again, but chances are there won\u2019t be a starting five that includes Barnes and Joe Harris again.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Only four of the original 35 players added to Team USA's roster played in the FIBA World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5VmyCyERcdqyIUva9SDWkA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05OTguNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cTR9gLsxcETc5f.vuLbjpg--~B/aD0yOTAxO3c9MzcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4dfe2750-d5cb-11e9-97fb-2fa11eaaad15", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
