REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are examining Facebook\u2019s (FB.O) proposed Libra cryptocurrency to see if it harms competition, Europe\u2019s antitrust regulator said on Wednesday, the latest watchdog to voice concerns about the social network\u2019s move into financial services.\n\nEuropean Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said scrutiny was justified even though the new digital coin, to be backed by four official currencies and available to billions of Facebook\u2019s users around the world, has yet to be launched.\n\n\u201cWe can even look at new services even before they\u2019re introduced. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now, with Facebook\u2019s plan for a new cryptocurrency, known as Libra, which it announced back in June,\u201d Vestager said in the text of a speech at a conference in Bergen, Norway.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at whether those proposals create risks for competition, so we can be ready to act swiftly if an intervention were to prove necessary,\u201d she said.\n\nLast month, she sent questionnaires to the 28 members of the Geneva-based Libra Association set up to govern the new currency, asking about the conditions for membership, according to an EU document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe document also asked how Libra-backed products and services will be integrated into Facebook\u2019s platforms WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Calibra, how the consumer data would be used and who would own it.\n\nPoliticians, central bankers and regulatory watchdogs have in recent months sounded the alarm about Libra and the disruption risks to the global financial system and the possibility that it may be used for money laundering.\n\nFacebook could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.", "description": "EU regulators are examining Facebook's proposed Libra cryptocurrency to see if it harms competition, Europe's antitrust regulator said on Wednesday, the latest watchdog to voice concerns about the social network's move into financial services.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426245210&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831W2"}
