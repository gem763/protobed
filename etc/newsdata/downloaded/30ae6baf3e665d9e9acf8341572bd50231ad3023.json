We're talking about Manchester United here.'\n\nCarragher then replied: 'Forget the league title, you (United) need to bridge the gap (to Manchester City and Liverpool) first so you need two or three players to do that. At the moment you're sixth or seventh'.\n\nKeane hit back with: 'That's right. But Liverpool are still trying to bridge that gap because they haven't got up there and won a league title.'\n\nFans predictably loved the exchange and took to social media afterwards to voice their pleasure.\n\nOne viewer, @CavaniConda, was clearly a huge fan of the put down. They wrote: 'This is pure savagery'.\n\nClearly agreeing with the Irishman's view, @dawkins1122 added: 'Quality keane there!!'.\n\n@venkateshkris14 also said: 'i genuinely feel sorry for carra :D'.\n\n@brenward74 tweeted: 'Cold brutal reality is that Roy is right...yes LFC have made serious strides forward but they have still not won PL.. i say that as a LFC fan... need to push on an win...then talk...'.", "description": "After Keane watched Liverpool's victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Carragher was discussing his former club's previous bids to win the title before Keane got stuck in.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/10/18817818-0-image-a-44_1569232350920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
