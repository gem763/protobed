The Vision Fund is a stakeholder in a number of the most renowned startups around the world, including Slack and Uber Technologies.\n\nThe Vision Fund also played a leading role in one of the largest swells in private investment in recent memory. Venture capital firms spread roughly $131 billion across 8,949 deals last year, according to data published by PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association Thursday. That record-setting level of spending was enough to signal to some that this is a bubble that could come to a gruesome end.\n\nThe company's now-dethroned CEO Adam Neumann told Forbes in 2017 that \"Our valuation and size today are much more based on our energy and spirituality than it is on a multiple of revenue.\"\n\nFinancial pitfalls forced SoftBank to strike a deal to take control of the company with $5 billion in new financing and up to $3 billion in a tender offer for existing shareholders. Without the rescue from SoftBank, WeWork would have been out of cash by the start of November.\n\nRevelations that WeWork was about one week from running out of cash represented the latest chapter in a string of bad news for the company since it released its IPO prospectus in August. The filing revealed a massive $900 million loss in the first six months of 2019. It also reported at the time that it had long-term lease obligations of $17.9 billion.\n\nEstimations of the company's value have declined quickly since late-summer. What was once expected to be one of 2019\u2032s hottest IPOs at a value of $47 billion has turned into a string of mishaps that's seen the company's value sink to around $8 billion.\n\n\u2014 Click here for the original Wall Street Journal report.", "description": "The SoftBank fund responsible for bankrolling WeWork is reportedly dialing back its hallmark high-risk investment strategy.", "authors": ["Thomas Franck"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105093504-GettyImages-827174906.jpg?v=1572008847", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
