It's better at the back. And if possible if you cycle or walk, choose a road with less traffic.\n\n\"But in general this needs to be addressed at policy levels.\"", "description": "Particles of black carbon pollution can cross to the fetal side of the placenta, a study finds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/63B4/production/_108842552_pregnantimage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
