AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin\n\nMr Buttigieg piled on. \u201cThat was a yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said.\n\nAn average of polls collated by RealClearPoltics suggests Joe Biden still has the advantage of a couple of points over Ms Warren. Yet, with questions being asked about the former vice president\u2019s age, and more recently him being accused of wrongdoing in Ukraine when he was vice president as part of the fall-out from the whistleblower controversy, many have believed the momentum is with the Massachusetts senator.\n\nAs it was, she showed she could defend herself as crisply as she could attack.\n\n\u201cI have made clear what my principles are here, and that is that costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and, for hard-working middle class families, costs will go down,\u201d she said at one point.\n\nShe added: \u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax. It\u2019s why does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation?\u201d\n\nThe debate in Ohio was the first since Bernie Sanders was taken to hospital last month, and it was subsequently revealed he suffered a heart attack. Amid concern he may not be able to participate, the 78-year-old delivered a strong performance, as lively as ever, and determined to deliver the response he wanted to, no matter what question he was asked.\n\nIt was later reported the Vermont senator, who spoke movingly of his gratitude for the messages of support he had received while recovering, is to receive the endorsement of New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It was reported the two will appear together this weekend at an event in the New York borough of Queens.\n\n\u201cLet me take this moment if I might to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening.\u201d\n\nThe debate was also the first since Democrats formally announced an impeachment investigation of Mr Trump, amid accusations from a member of the US intelligence community that the president sought to pressure the leader of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Mr Biden.\n\nMr Trump has dismissed the move as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d while also admitting Democrats in the House have sufficient votes to impeach him. On Tuesday night, there was near unanimity on the need to proceed with censuring the president. Mr Biden said he was \u201cthe most corrupt in modern history and all of our history\u201d.\n\nCory Booker, who earned praise for his declaration that men must help in the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights, will have considered he had a good night. He also urged his rivals not to tear each other apart in the process to select a nominee, something the party failed to do in 2008 and 2016.\n\n\u201cI have seen this script before,\u201d said Mr Booker. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work in 2016 and it will be a disaster for us in 2020.\u201d\n\nAlong with Mr Buttigieg and Ms Klobuchar, supporters of Hawaiian congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard will feel their candidate also managed to stand out amid a crowded field. Kamala Harris also landed many decent points, a return to form after a couple of quiet performances.\n\nMs Gabbard, the 38-year-old military veteran who served in Iraq, has stood out with her criticism of US foreign policy and she was no different on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThe slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime-change war that we\u2019ve been waging in Syria. Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand \u2014 but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime-change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime-change war,\u201d she said.\n\nBy contrast, supporters of Beto O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro will have been disappointed. Despite occasional flashes, neither was able to display the edge or passion they showed at the last debate in Houston. The 12th candidate, Tom Steyer, a billionaire who spent $30m of his own money to be present, had little chance to shine.\n\nHis best moment probably came in his opening address. He said: \u201cI want to remind everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Democratic candidates condemned Donald Trump as the most corrupt president in US history and clashed on gun control, healthcare and foreign policy in the latest primary debate.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/00/debate-wrap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
