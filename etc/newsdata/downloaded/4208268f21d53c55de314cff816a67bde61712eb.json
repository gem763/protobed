Pictured: Beth, 17, who was kept in a secure unit and fed through a hatch\n\nJeremy, pictured right, has not been able to hug his autistic daughter Bethany, pictured left, for two years since she was placed in an isolation cell in a psychiatric hospital in Birmingham\n\nThe distressing case of Beth, 17, was highlighted as part of the MoS campaign exposing how people with autism and learning disabilities are being locked up, held in solitary confinement, violently restrained and pumped full of drugs to sedate them.\n\nThe draft review, leaked to this newspaper, proposes an end to abusive detention of children and teenagers with autism or learning difficulties in secure hospitals when they do not have mental health issues, along with stopping the routine use of seclusion that intensifies stress.\n\n\u2018There is evidence that admission to inappropriate physical environments initiates a cycle of behaviour that challenges, resulting in increasingly restrictive practices including seclusion,\u2019 it concludes.\n\nAmong key recommendations are the launch of a worldwide probe into better care models, mandatory assessment of human rights, and development of a \u2018parental rights-based approach\u2019 aided by \u2018system navigators\u2019 to guide patients and families.\n\n\u2018It is great to hear there will be acknowledgement of problems in the system,\u2019 said Jeremy, Beth\u2019s father. \u2018But now they must act to stop the suffering.\u2019\n\nHe fought off an injunction from Walsall Council to stop him speaking in public about his daughter\u2019s plight. Other families have been silenced by court-imposed gags.\n\nRightful Lives, a family campaign group, said it wanted to see an urgent overhaul of commissioning alongside \u2018more and better\u2019 community provision. \u2018Those who continue to pay for poor services or who fail to carry out their statutory duties need to be held accountable,\u2019 said a spokeswoman.\n\nThe MoS discovered private firms running units earn up to \u00a3730,000 a year per patient \u2013 yet autism is not a mental health condition \u2013 while community provision is often cheaper, closer to home and more effective.\n\nFamilies have spoken of seeking help only to have their children locked up and turned into \u2018zombies\u2019 from being forcibly injected with powerful drugs. One man has been locked up for 18 years, ten of them in solitary confinement.\n\nShe is being kept at St Andrews hospital in Birmingham. The institution said in a statement its top priority is to provide the best possible care for patients\n\nOur disturbing reports have sparked a series of official inquiries. \u2018I am determined to do everything I can to make sure no more vulnerable people have to endure the same horrific experiences that Beth went through,\u2019 said Mr Hancock last night.\n\nYet there have been repeated pledges to stop detaining people with autism and learning disabilities in assessment and treatment units since 2011, when hideous abuse was exposed at Winterbourne View care home in Gloucestershire.\n\n\u2018I sat in endless meetings after Winterbourne View and they all said the same things they are saying again now,\u2019 said Alicia Wood, a former health department adviser. \u2018They need to show some teeth to stop this incarceration destroying lives.\u2019\n\nThe most recent NHS data showed 245 children with autism or learning disabilities were locked up in August, more than double the number three years ago, along with 2,255 adults. There was also a record number of restraints used in one month.\n\nFigures obtained by Norman Lamb, Liberal Democrat MP and former care Minister, have shown an alarming 57 per cent rise in the use of anti-psychotic drug prescriptions since 2007, including for patients with autism and learning disabilities.\n\n\u2018These drugs are often used as a control mechanism, which is simply wrong,\u2019 he said. \u2018This is a sign something has gone badly wrong when all advice is to avoid using them if possible for people with autism and learning disabilities.\u2019\n\nAn NHS spokesman said the review was still being finalised but it was taking action to support people living with a learning disability or autism.\n\n\u2018Since 2015, the number of people in hospital has reduced by more than a fifth and a programme introduced to stop overmedication of people with a learning disability,\u2019 the spokesman added.", "description": "Teresa Fenech, a nursing chief at NHS England, admitted the failings in a review that was sparked after revelations that a 17-year-old with the condition, named Bethany, was being fed through a hatch.", "authors": ["Ian Birrell For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/02/7442602-0-Bethany_aged_12_in_her_grandparents_garden_As_the_family_approac-a-38_1570324490888.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
