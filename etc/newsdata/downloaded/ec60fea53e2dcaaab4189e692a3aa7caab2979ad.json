Stand With Hong Kong.\" The notion was quickly rejected by team owner Tilman Fertitta.\n\n\"I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\" Morey said. \"I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\"\n\nEarlier, a Chinese sportswear maker, two banks that sponsored the Rockets and a Chinese broadcaster that aired games bailed on the team, according to Reuters.\n\nThe sportswear maker, Li-Ning, expressed \"strong condemnation\" of Morey's tweet, saying in a statement it had suspended cooperation with the Rockets, and one of the banks, SPD, said it had halted marketing and publicity activities with them, Reuters reported.\n\nIn Houston, the Chinese consulatealso weighed in Sunday, saying officials were \"deeply shocked\" by Morey's comments and urging the team to \"take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact.\"\n\nIn a statement Sunday, NBA chief communications officer Mike Bass called Morey's tweet \"regrettable\" and said the league had \"great respect for the history and culture of China.\"\n\n\"The NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\" Bass said.\n\nElected officials from across the political divide blasted the NBA and China, including Texas Sen.
