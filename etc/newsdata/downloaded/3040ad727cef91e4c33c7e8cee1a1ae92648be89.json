The decision was overturned, with Bumrah becoming the third Indian bowler to claim a test hat-trick.\n\n\u201cI was not very sure of the appeal,\u201d Bumrah told Kohli in an interview to bcci.tv.\n\n\u201cI thought it was bat (first), so I didn\u2019t appeal so much. But it was a good review in the end, and I think I owe the hat-trick to the captain.\u201d\n\nBumrah finished with 6-27 as West Indies were bowled out for 117 in reply India\u2019s 416 in the first innings.\n\nIt followed the 25-year-old\u2019s blistering second innings spell in the opening test where he finished with 5-7. Ishant Sharma took eight wickets in that match and Mohammed Shami chipped in with four as India recorded a convincing 318 runs victory.\n\nBumrah put down his recent success on pace-friendly tracks to his camaraderie with senior bowlers in the squad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of communication that goes on the field as well,\u201d Bumrah told reporters.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m getting wickets, it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s job to create pressure, and when somebody else is getting wickets, (it\u2019s) my job is to create pressure.\n\n\u201cWe got a good relationship all of us, we want to get better every year.\u201d\n\nIndia are closing in on a 2-0 sweep of series after West Indies ended day three at 45-2 while chasing an unlikely target of 468 for victory.", "description": "India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah said he owes his maiden test hat-trick to captain Virat Kohli, who successfully reviewed a leg-before decision which was initially turned down in the ongoing second match against West Indies.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425293000&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810DX"}
