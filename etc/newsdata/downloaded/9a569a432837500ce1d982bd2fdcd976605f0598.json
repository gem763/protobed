Energy stocks led losses in New York on rising worries of a no-deal between the US and China.\n\n\n\nNetflix, on the other hand, had a good day, as its third-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates. The company\u2019s shares jumped 11%, as a better-than-expected performance overseas outweighed the slowing subscriptions partly due to rising fees at home. Netflix said it aims to aboard 7 million new international customers over the next three months, but warned that the launch of Apple TV and Disney+ \u2018will be noisy\u2019, and there could be a \u2018modest headwind\u2019 to their near-term growth, which has been factored in in their fourth-quarter guidance.\n\n\n\nPhilip Morris and Morgan Stanley are the next to release results today.\n\n\n\nWTI crude rebounded to $53.75 a barrel but gave back gains to settle near the $53 level in Asia.\n\n\n\nEnergy stocks edged marginally higher in Sydney, although the ASX index slid (-0.47%) on waning business optimism in the third quarter. Mining stocks lost 1.63% as iron ore in Dalian commodity exchange fell 2.23%.\n\n\n\nYet, the Aussie jumped after a strong jobs report eased the expectations of a softer monetary policy from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in the coming meeting, while in the US, the unexpected 0.3% m-o-m decline in retail sales revived the expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would again lower its rates at its October meeting. The US 10-year yield gapped below the 1.74% level, as the probability of a 25-basis-point cut rose to 84%.\n\n\n\nDue today, the US industrial production data could confirm a 0.2% monthly decline in September, versus 0.6% expansion printed a month earlier. Weak data could further spur the dovish Fed expectations, pull the US sovereign yields and the dollar lower.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, stocks in Hong Kong (+0.87%) gained as the US House passed a bill requiring an annual assessment of the city\u2019s fundamentals to keep its special status intact. The US\u2019 support may have been a relief for some investors, but on this front, we know that Beijing has a clear agenda for 2047. The question is, whether the recent political outbreak would fasten the transition phase or not. The Hang Seng index gained more than 5% this week, some profit-taking could slowdown the rally near the 27000 marks into the weekend.\n\n\n\nGold remained offered past $1490 an ounce, as sovereign yields advanced in Europe and in Asia.\n\n\n\nThe EURUSD advanced to 1.1085 on a softer US dollar. An option barrier is seen at 1.1090 at today\u2019s expiry. If surpassed, the pair could extend gains toward its 200-day moving average, 1.1138.\n\n\n\nPhilip Morris\u2019 earnings under pressure as e-cigarette business at jeopardy\n\n\n\nPhilip Morris shares recovered half of July-September\u2019s 23% decline, but the future looks rather blurry for the tobacco giant, not only because the cigarette sales are on a declining path across the globe, but also because the e-cigarette business is at jeopardy after the announcement of several health issues related to vaping. On the other hand, the company\u2019s efforts to diversify its revenues via an investment in a marijuana company called Cronos didn\u2019t pay as much as expected so far. Cronos shares lost more than 55% since June. As a result, the PM\u2019s comparable EPS may have dropped by 5% in the third quarter.\n\n\n\nYes, no or maybe?\n\n\n\nBritish and European policymakers downplayed the possibility of a Brexit agreement in the coming days. Although the parties seem to have come close to a deal at this week\u2019s talks, they couldn\u2019t find a solution to the Irish border paradox yet. And the truth is, even if the leaders came to an agreement among themselves, there is only a slim chance for Boris Johnson to find sufficient support in Parliament to give it a green light.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the pound extended its rally to 1.2877 against the US dollar on Wednesday, as the recent rebound motivated, or forced pound-bears to close their short positions quite hurriedly.\n\n\n\nBut the pound markets may have gotten well ahead of themselves. There are rising signs of discomfort at the actual levels. The two-week risk reversals covering the October 31st deadline made a sharp U-turn and became negative, hinting that investors have stopped hedging the upside risks in sterling and began hedging the downside risks, again.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Cable remained supported above the $1.28 in Asia. Large options expiries from 1.26 to 1.29 should give additional support to buyers today.\n\n\n\nOn the data front, the retail sales excluding autos may have risen to 2.9% y-o-y in September versus 2.2% printed a month earlier. A strong sales data could give a further positive spin to the pound despite the lingering Brexit uncertainties.\n\n\n\nThe British blue-chip index underperformed its European peers on Wednesday on the back of a stronger sterling and waning risk appetite.\n\n\n\n\n\nFTSE futures (+0.06%) traded sideways in Asia, pointing at a flat open in London on Thursday.\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 2 points higher at 7170\n\n\n\nto open 10 points lower at 12660\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
