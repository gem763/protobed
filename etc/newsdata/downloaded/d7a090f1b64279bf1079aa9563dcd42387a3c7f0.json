The Trump administration dispatched top officials to Turkey on Wednesday for emergency talks with Ankara to try to halt the assault while Russian troops swept into territory abandoned by American forces.\n\nKobani said that while the military agreement calls for Russian-backed Syrian troops to deploy across SDF-stronghold areas along the border with Turkey, reports of the SDF handing control of territory in recent days to government forces were incorrect.\n\nKobani said the Kurdish-led group, which was Washington's main ally in the battle to oust Islamic State, has now turned its attention to pushing back the Turkish invasion.\n\n\"The war against Islamic State, as we have said previously, will not be a priority for us, our main goal now is the protection of our people and our areas,\" said Kobani.\n\nHis forces would, however, continue to be in charge of roughly 12,000 detainees from Islamic State being held in their territory, Kobani said.\n\nKurdish leaders have said that the Turkish invasion could compromise their ability to adequately hold thousands of foreign militants and their families captured during the ouster of Islamic State, and have pleaded with governments to take their citizens back.
