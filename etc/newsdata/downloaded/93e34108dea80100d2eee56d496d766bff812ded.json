Sen. Bernie Sanders, for example, speaks at the site of a devastating California wildfire and Sen. Kamala Harris along a flood-prone area of the Mississippi River.\n\nThe Weather Channel has done specials on the impact of climate change in Alaska and along the Louisiana coast, for example, but this is the first time the network has gotten involved directly in a political campaign.\n\n\u201cIt gets the conversation going in a big way,\u201d said Rick Knabb, the network\u2019s on-air hurricane expert and former director of the National Hurricane Center. He and meteorologist Stephanie Abrams traded off on the interviews.\n\nThe Weather Channel wanted to do the special through its own scientific lens, said Nora Zimmett, the network\u2019s senior vice president for content and programming. Although other networks inquired about joining and doing a town hall-style event, TWC turned them down.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to have a food fight about whose plan is better,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the special is something new for the network, Zimmett said executives weren\u2019t concerned about turning off weather fans who view it as a refuge from politics, or people like the president who see less urgency in addressing the issue. Despite a \u201cvocal minority,\u201d surveys show most viewers want to learn more about the issue and potential solutions, she said.\n\nTrump may not be there, but the special won\u2019t ignore him or what his administration has been doing, Knabb said.\n\nTrump recently mocked Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg on Twitter for a United Nations speech to world leaders and skipped a UN meeting on the issue.\n\nAll three announced Republican challengers to Trump \u2014 Joe Walsh, former Illinois congressman, Bill Weld, former Massachusetts governor, and Mark Sanford, former South Carolina governor and congressman \u2014 are interviewed. For time reasons, organizers chose the top seven Democrats in the polls: in addition to Sanders and Harris, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Former Vice President Joe Biden was not interviewed; his campaign said it was a scheduling issue.\n\nKnabb said the interviews have taught him a lot about the complexities of proposed solutions.\n\n\u201cThe public is going to learn a lot from this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Weather Channel\u2019s show is separate from the Covering Climate Now initiative, which encouraged news organizations to do more stories on climate change. There\u2019s been some criticism that the issue hasn\u2019t received enough attention during the presidential debates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been lonely here on these issues,\u201d Zimmett said, \u201cand all we can do is hope that our friends at other media outlets join us.\u201d", "description": "The Weather Channel is moving beyond cold fronts and heat waves to wade into the politics of climate change, with a special planned for early next month that...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH184_rockie_ZG_20190408211412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
