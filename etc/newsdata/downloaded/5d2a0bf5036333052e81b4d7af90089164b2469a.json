But just how much does a potential Biden nomination fire up voters? The Philadelphia Inquirer checked out the response to Team Biden debate parties, and found out that there wasn\u2019t any at all:\n\nHe was hosting a presidential debate-watching party for Joe Biden supporters just blocks from the former vice president\u2019s national campaign headquarters. He didn\u2019t expect a big crowd, but in the end only one other person showed up. The two men watched in silence and both left before the three-hour debate ended. A reporter turned off the TV on her way out. Bradford\u2019s was one of three watch parties within a 20-mile radius of Center City registered with the campaign. None drew more than seven people. Elsewhere in Philadelphia, fans of Sen. Elizabeth Warren pinned on buttons and wore \u201cPhilly for Warren\u201d T-shirts. They gathered in six different locations from South Philadelphia to Wynnefield cheering at Warren\u2019s responses and jeering when her opponents took shots. Local supporters of Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have also had well-attended watch parties here. It makes for quite a contrast. But does it matter?\n\nIn Philadelphia? In the state where Biden claims his heritage as a working-class stiff? Yeah, it matters.\n\nAfter humiliating losses in the \u201cblue wall\u201d states, voters want someone who can credibly campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan, and especially Pennsylvania. Biden\u2019s continuous name-checking of Scranton in his bio and his claim to connect on a personal level with working-class voters outside of the party\u2019s urban-academic bubble are the factors that so far have outweighed Biden\u2019s downsides. Those are not insignificant, and include his age, his nearly fifty years in Washington, and his habit of telling tall tales and outright lies on the campaign trail. And that\u2019s apart from his plagiarism of Neil Kinnock\u2019s speeches in 1987, too.\n\nThe data coming out of Pennsylvania is sparse, but it\u2019s not looking good for Biden. He only has a 7.5-point lead in RCP\u2019s aggregation, but his numbers have tanked of late in the state. In early May, Quinnipiac had Biden up 39/13 over Bernie Sanders and Biden led 28/21 over Warren in early August in a Franklin & Marshall poll. A Susquehanna poll two weeks ago only gave Biden 17% of the vote, with 52% undecided and Warren coming in second at 9%. That trend is running in the wrong direction, which makes the debate-party turnout look more indicative of Biden\u2019s slippage in the Keystone State.\n\nBiden\u2019s supporters argue that enthusiasm is overrated:\n\nEnthusiasm is a tricky thing to define and measure. Polls are more rigorous, and, while he\u2019s dropped, Biden still leads in many. That\u2019s a sign that \u201can enthusiasm gap \u2014 if it exists \u2014 will not make a difference in the primary,\u201d said G. Terry Madonna, a pollster at Franklin & Marshall College. In the end, an unenthusiastic vote counts the same as an enthusiastic one, said Chris Borick, a pollster at Muhlenberg College. \u201cYou don\u2019t get bonus points for excitement.\u201d\n\nTrue, but you also don\u2019t get volunteers and neighborhood coordinators without it. It takes lots of ground organization to win primaries, a lesson one would have thought Biden would have learned from his former boss Barack Obama. One would have thought Democrats would have learned it as well, and yet they backed Hillary Clinton three years ago as their default electability candidate too. How did that work out \u2014 especially in Pennsylvania?\n\nSalena Zito warns that it\u2019s about to happen again:\n\nWhich leads us back to what we have seen on the debate stage for the past few months from the Democratic presidential candidates: They \u2014 with the exception of Amy Klobuchar and sometimes Pete Buttigieg \u2014 have clearly not learned why Clinton lost. Certainly, Elizabeth Warren hasn\u2019t. The national press see her as a safe front-runner, largely because they find her a familiar character. They know someone in their personal or professional lives who is just like her: She is their neighbor, their relative, or they were taught by someone like her in college. Warren\u2019s viewpoints are also familiar in the newsroom, to put it gently. It\u2019s not the same out here. \u2026 There are a healthy amount of middle-class suburban voters who are looking for an alternative to their options currently. It appears only two on that stage understood the lessons of 2016 and 2018: the mayor of a Midwest city and the senator from a Midwest state. The rest seem to be repeating the mistakes of the former senator from New York.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t look like Biden\u2019s going to save them from that fate, either.", "description": "Turn out the lights ...", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/biden-debate.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
