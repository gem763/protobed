(Richard Heathcote/Getty Images)\n\nOn Jan. 22, 1973, a pair of unbeaten one-time Olympic gold medalists met for the heavyweight championship in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nJoe Frazier, the reigning champion, weighed in at 214 pounds, 8\u00bd more than he\u2019d weighed 22 months earlier for his epic \u201cFight of the Century\u201d bout with Muhammad Ali on March 8, 1971, in New York, when he came in at 205\u00bd.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt was obvious Frazier wanted to bulk up a bit to prepare for George Foreman, who at 6-foot-3 had four inches in height and six inches in reach on Frazier.\n\nForeman was a menacing figure even then who was known as \u201cBig George.\u201d He knocked Frazier down six times en route to a stunning second-round TKO victory.\n\nForeman would go on to be one of the greatest heavyweights who ever lived. But if he were boxing in the modern era, he would have needed a different nickname, though \u201cAverage George\u201d doesn\u2019t have the same kind of cachet as \u201cBig George.\u201d\n\nThe best heavyweights these days have become the size of NBA power forwards or NFL defensive ends.\n\nWBC champion Deontay Wilder is 6-7, 225 with an 83-inch reach. Former champion Anthony Joshua is 6-6, 245 with an 82-inch reach. Tyson Fury is 6-9, 255 with an 85-inch reach. And though unified champion Andy Ruiz is \u201conly\u201d 6-2 with a 74-inch reach, he generally fights around 260 pounds.\n\nOn and on goes the list of giants in the division, which makes Oleksandr Usyk\u2019s bid to become a player at heavyweight that much more of a challenge. The one-time undisputed cruiserweight champion will make his heavyweight debut Saturday (7 p.m. ET, DAZN) in Chicago. He was to face Tyrone Spong, but Spong failed an anti-doping test and is out of the bout.\n\nPromoter Eddie Hearn hasn\u2019t yet named a replacement, but he\u2019s zeroed in on Chazz Witherspoon.\n\nStory continues\n\nA 2012 Olympic gold medalist in London, Usyk has the boxing skills to be a factor at heavyweight. He has terrific footwork, fast hands and good defensive instincts. He\u2019s difficult to hit, and as a left-hander, he creates matchup problems for the right-handed dominant division.\n\nBut, while at the same height and with the identical 78-inch reach Foreman once had, Usyk will give up size to most of the heavyweight contenders he faces. He\u2019s fought at 200 pounds as a cruiserweight, so it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll be any more than 220 on Saturday when he debuts at heavyweight.\n\nWeight-wise, he wouldn\u2019t give much up to Wilder, who was only 212\u00bd when he fought Tyson Fury. Wilder is an extraordinary puncher, however, and has more than five inches of reach on Usyk.\n\nThere is no place in the sport for heavyweights the size of Frazier or Rocky Marciano, whose size would simply make them cruiserweights these days. Marciano, who was 48-0 in his legendary Hall of Fame career, was only 5-10\u00bd with a 68-inch reach.\n\nThey\u2019d simply be physically overmatched. And while Marciano was a legendarily hard puncher, he only weighed more than 190 pounds in three fights.\n\nTony Bellew (L) reacts to a blow from Oleksandr Usyk during their cruiserweight bout Nov. 10, 2018, in Manchester, England. Usyk successfully defended his four belts and likely sent Bellew into retirement by knocking out the British fighter in the eighth round. (Nick Potts/PA via AP)\n\nUsyk isn\u2019t at that kind of a disadvantage, and as a slick boxer, he\u2019ll create issues for whichever one of the elite big men at the top of the division he\u2019d face. But he hasn\u2019t proven he can take a punch from a man that size and continue on.\n\nManagers tend to have their guys shy away from southpaws with boxing skill, so it\u2019s doubtful that Wilder, Ruiz, Joshua or Fury will be in any kind of a hurry to get into the ring with Usyk.\n\nUsyk, though, would be walking a precarious tight rope against each of them. He\u2019d give up more than 25 pounds to Ruiz, Fury and/or Joshua, at least four inches of reach to Wilder, Joshua and Fury, and three inches, four inches and six inches of height, respectively, to Joshua, Wilder and Fury.\n\nThat said, Usyk\u2019s a brilliant technician in the ring who has repeatedly shown the ability to walk his opponents into punches and to avoid the kind of long punches that most heavyweights throw.\n\nAnother former cruiserweight champion, Murat Gassiev, will campaign at heavyweight soon, and he\u2019s similar in size to Usyk. Gassiev, who lost to Usyk for the undisputed cruiserweight title in the finals of the World Boxing Super Series\u2019 first tournament, is 6-4 with a 76-inch reach.\n\nHe\u2019s more of a puncher but far less of a boxer than Usyk. But if he could get himself to 230 or 235 and his power translates, he could also be a factor.\n\nThe division is, for the foreseeable future, going to be the domain of the big men. In addition to Wilder, Fury, Joshua and Ruiz, prospects like 2016 gold medalist Tony Yoka (6-7, 82-inch reach), Efe Ajagba (6-6, 85-inch reach), Daniel Dubois (6-5, 78-inch reach) and Filip Hrgovic (6-6, 82-inch reach) are all larger heavyweights.\n\nUsyk is skilled enough to compete with the best of the heavyweights. Whether he\u2019ll be able to compensate for being the much smaller man for the first time in his career, though, is something that only time can tell.\n\nHere\u2019s guessing he can, but a perfectly placed right hand on the chin by the likes of Wilder or Joshua could say otherwise.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Usyk will give up size to most of the heavyweight contenders he faces.", "authors": ["Kevin Iole"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/X3bg.TRW0rVZMURDbPlWPw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTYuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P0Dcl0jwoGZ3YSZlb9pD7w--~B/aD0zMjI4O3c9NDgyNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ce1c6350-e9ff-11e9-ba4c-7d787d05ca86", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
