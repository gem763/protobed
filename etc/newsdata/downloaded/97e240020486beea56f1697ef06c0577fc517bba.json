Our most analogized president has been compared to Hitler and Stalin, Jesus, a chess grandmaster, and Julius Caesar. The Daily Beast\u2019s Clive Irving likened Trump to an early-stage Mussolini. Frank Palmieri at AlterNet countered: Trump is no Mussolini, he\u2019s Charles II of England.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen this before, over 2,000 years ago, when another insurgent faux-populist movement whipped disaffected citizens into an anti-establishment frenzy.\n\nThe echoes of his worldview can be heard nearly a century before Caesar\u2019s rise, when Tiberius Gracchus convinced Roman citizens to hollow out their governing institutions.
