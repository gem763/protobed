Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade believes an FTA would give the country's exporters even more of an edge in a market with more than 500 million people.\n\nBut as part of the agreement, the European Union has requested the protection of a range of what it terms \"geographical indication\" names \u2014 products that are legally protected there to protect traditional, localized makers and guarantee quality. Australia already recognizes some GIs , such as Champagne\n\nfor example, will need to change their name \u2014 perhaps to something like \"Australian feta,\" If Australia agrees, cheese makers that have called their product \"feta,\"for example, will need to change their name \u2014 perhaps to something like \"Australian feta,\" according to CNN affiliate SBS News. That's because even if those manufacturers use the same processes as traditional feta cheese makers, their cheese isn't made in the geographical area that is required under EU law for it to be described as simply \"feta.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Australia's Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Simon Birmingham, opened the list up to public consultation, saying he wanted to hear directly from Australian farmers and businesses.\n\n\"Australians can be confident that we will drive a very hard bargain \u2014 as we always do \u2014 to achieve an overall agreement that delivers more opportunity for Australian farmers and businesses,\" he said in a statement. \"Ultimately, we will only do this deal if overall it is in Australia's interests to do so.\"\n\nThe National Farmers' Federation (NFF), an Australian national body representing farmers and agriculture, has already indicated that it is concerned about GI restrictions, saying earlier this year that limitations on the word \"feta\" would have \"dire ramifications for our dairy farmers.\"\n\nCheese is a big industry in the country: Between July 2017 and June 2018, Australia exported $945 million (US $639 million) of cheese, according to statistics from Dairy Australia, the national body for the country's dairy industry.\n\nlook for product names they are familiar with, such as \"feta.\" A name change requirement could mean Australian food makers lose the market they developed, she added.
