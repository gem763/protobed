But when baby Jaden arrived, his crying and feeding schedules, and Blake\u2019s sleepless nights, began to take a toll on her once-agreeable living arrangement.\n\n\u201cIt can be difficult living with kids for someone who doesn\u2019t have them,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter leaving her flat, Blake, now 35, didn\u2019t have a home of her own for the better part of a year. She slept on a friend\u2019s couch for several months before saving enough to put down a deposit on a house, aided by a housing start-up. But even then, she knew she\u2019d have to divide the rent and bills with others to be able to afford the expenses of keeping a house \u2013 and it was difficult to find housemates who were comfortable living with a single mother with young children.\n\nAn internet search led her to CoAbode, a website that connects single mothers looking for shared accommodation. CoAbode was founded by Carmel Boss in 2002, after her own marriage ended and she had to raise her seven-year-old son in Los Angeles on her own.\n\n\u201cAs a new single mom I felt lonely and doubtful about raising my son on my own,\u201d says Boss. \u201cWhere was my tribe, my village?\u201d\n\nBoss put out an ad in a local paper for another single mum to share a home with. When 18 women responded she knew she was on to something. The pooled resources and emotional support that came from living with another single mother was something that mums were craving \u2013 and, throughout the past two decades, she says that hundreds of thousands of mothers have signed up on the site to find a housing match, including Emily Blake.\n\nIn early August Blake picked up the keys for a five-bedroom home in Alemeda, an area of Los Angeles in California. There she and three mothers and their children will make their own \u2018mommune\u2019.", "description": "Could the increasing prevalence of co-living arrangements for single mothers help provide a better environment for kids \u2013 and mums?", "authors": ["Summer Eldemire"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7l/qs/p07lqszx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
