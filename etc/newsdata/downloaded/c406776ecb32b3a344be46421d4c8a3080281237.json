In August, Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel said that he believes that blockchain-based currencies will continue to grow and could become more popular.\n\nAt the time, Fogel predicted that cash will be rarely used in the future, adding that he sees the potential for a new form of global currency that is protected and secure:\n\n\u201cWhen Bitcoin became well known, many questioned its legitimacy, and while the jury is still out on the future of Bitcoin, I do believe currencies with a blockchain base will continue to surface and may become more widely accepted across the globe, especially outside the U.S., which has a well-accepted credit card payment system.\u201d\n\nAhead of upcoming Mark Zuckerberg testimony\n\nThe move comes ahead of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony on Libra before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23. Announcing the meeting, Congresswoman Maxine Waters mentioned the draft bill \u201cKeep Big Tech Out of Finance Act,\u201d which is designed to ban large tech firms from getting licensed as financial institutions in the United States.\n\nPreviously, Calibra wallet CEO David Marcus testified before the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee in regard to Libra\u2019s development and its features. Marcus claimed that Facebook intends to be compliant with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in distributing Libra.\n\nHowever, some lawmakers met Marcus\u2019 statements with skepticism and concern. Earlier today, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin attributed the recent spate of firms abandoning Facebook\u2019s Libra stablecoin project to regulatory concerns, although some industry stakeholders believe that policymakers pressured companies to leave the project.", "description": "Leading online travel company Booking Holdings has ditched the Libra Association, a non-profit Facebook established to pursue the promotion of its Libra stablec...", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9lODAwZmVhNDkwOGNkNGUwN2QyODQ0MWY0MGMzNDAxNy5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
