The number of fintech companies in Australia has swelled from 100 to almost 700 in just four years, according to KPMG. In just the first six months of 2018, $58 billion was invested in fintech firms around the world.\n\nPaul Bassat holds stakes in Prospa and four other fintechs through his venture capital firm Square Peg Capital. He says the sheer number of opportunities coming across his desk from the sector is staggering. \u201cI am not sure that people understand the disruptive threat in this sector,\u201d Bassat says.\n\nIndeed, the forces propelling fintech higher, and its captains up the ranks of the Young Rich, are doubly strong. The newcomers are nimble, and the major banks are actively retreating out of areas that are proving too hot to handle \u2013 including interest-only mortgages, parts of the business-lending market and loans to self-managed superannuation funds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to overstate the impact of the royal commission, but at a time when there are a lot of disruptive business models emerging, the banks are feeling a degree of nervousness,\u201d Bassat says. \u201cThere is perhaps an element of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. That, if anything, means the opportunities for disruption are greater.\u201d\n\nUnsecured small-business lending\n\nThe secret to a lot of success in fintech has been a willingness to play where the banks won\u2019t. For Prospa that has meant pushing into unsecured small-business lending, once considered the Wild West of commercial lending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBanks rarely lend to small business without taking security, so owners typically have to mortgage their homes to get finance to grow. Moshal and Bertoli, who started Prospa in 2012 and are joint CEOs, knew that pain first-hand. \u201cI often joke our market research was actually trying to get a loan,\u201d Moshal says, as he greets AFR Magazine before we start our tour of the firm\u2019s offices.\n\nMoshal, who speaks with a trace of the accent of his native South Africa, had run a string of businesses \u2013 including a fashion business and a laundry chain back in South Africa \u2013 while Bertoli has seen the small-business finance world up close through his role as an executive at financial services company FlexiGroup. The pair met through a mutual friend. Their idea was simple enough: to make it much easier, and faster, for small businesses to get a loan. Investors backing their plans include AirTree Ventures, Square Peg, Britain\u2019s Entree Capital and Ironbridge Capital.\n\nThe office we\u2019re standing in is Prospa\u2019s latest home, office space having been a constant challenge. Downstairs many staff sit in what Prospa calls pods, where a product designer, a user experience expert and a developer sit with a finance and risk person. It\u2019s the sort of \u201cagile\u201d model banks such as ANZ are paying millions to establish.\n\nProspa cancelled float\n\nIf you\u2019re not in the market for a small-business loan, you probably know Prospa as the company that, embarrassingly, had to pull its public float. In June it was set to list on the ASX, having raised $147 million, when it got caught up in the Australian Security and Investment Commission\u2019s review of unfair contract terms across the financial services sector. Just 15 minutes before Moshal and Bertoli were due to ring the bell at a ceremony in Sydney, the company announced that the float would be delayed for 48 hours so that it could \u201cclarify queries raised by ASIC\u201d. Four months later, the float still hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nThe incident might have set tongues wagging in Martin Place and on Collins Street, but the business hasn\u2019t missed a beat. Bringing the team through the aftermath of the aborted listing, says Bertoli, has strengthened Prospa. \u201cYou actually pull together and come through something difficult like that in a better place.\u201d\n\nAnd while equity market capital hasn\u2019t yet rolled in, the customers certainly have. In late September Prospa revealed it sold $367 million of loans in 2017-18, up 70 per cent on the previous year. That\u2019s up 9 per cent on the forecasts made in its abandoned prospectus. Prospa has now lent $750 million to more than 15,000 small businesses, and Bertoli is bullish about the size of the small-business sector the banks won\u2019t touch. \u201cThere is $20 billion per annum [in demand for small-business credit] that we see is not being funded. It shows just how big the opportunity is.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we tour the two (soon to be three) floors of Prospa\u2019s office with chief financial officer Ed Bigazzi and chief operating officer Ben Lamb, the scale of the 200-person operation becomes apparent. This is no fledgling start-up. On the first floor sits the finance team, who run the credit decision engine that delivers a credit rating for each prospective customer in just 30 seconds. Each loan must be then signed off by a human credit officer.\n\nThe whole process can take as little as one hour. Applicants enter some basic details about themselves and their firm. They then need to provide bank records, or give Prospa permission to tap into their business bank account, so a credit assessment can be made. For loans of more than $50,000, more detailed financial statements such as profit and loss are necessary.\n\nWe climb the stairs to Prospa\u2019s call centre, where a staff member will be assigned to a customer for the life of the loan. The average amount lent is about $26,000, with the typical loan term lasting 12 months. Chatting to staff members reveals a number of them have run their own small business.\n\nRisk management vital\n\nProspa won\u2019t lend for what it describes as \u201cnegative\u201d uses of capital, such as paying a tax debt, or consolidating existing loans. Some of the loans are to help smooth out seasonal lulls or timing issues in sectors such as manufacturing or construction, such as providing working capital to get a project off the ground well ahead of invoices getting paid.\n\nGiven all loans are unsecured, risk management is crucial \u2013 should a business go under, Prospa will stand at the back of the queue of creditors. And the price of its loans are not cheap: rates on individual loans range between 8.5 per cent and 29.9 per cent. By way of comparison, lending rates to small business at the banks start at 5 per cent, although only when the loan is backed by a mortgage.\n\nThe AFR Magazine Young Rich issue will be on news stands for the next four weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does Prospa avoid getting swamped by bad debts? Its repayment structures, which can be weekly and even daily, give it an early warning system for problem loans. Factors such as falling revenue, dishonoured payments in a bank account and even repeated credit checks will hurt a potential borrower\u2019s credit score.\n\nThe company is targeting a loss rate of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent and Bigazzi says the group remains in the \u201cmiddle of the fairway\u201d in terms of loan losses, despite a tick up towards the end of the year when it sold a record number of loans.\n\nCraig Dunn, the former chief executive of AMP, says unsecured lending and payments are the two areas that Australian fintech companies have concentrated on. Dunn, who left AMP in 2013, is uniquely placed to comment on the development of the sector, given he straddles both sides of the financial sector divide in his roles as chairman of Sydney-based fintech accelerator Stone & Chalk, and as a Westpac director.\n\nHe says Australian fintechs have focused \u201con a particular part of the banking product stack\u201d rather than attempting to compete against everything the banks can do. This plays to their key strength relative to the banks. \u201cTo manage and control an organisation with 30,000 or 40,000 people there\u2019s always an element of bureaucracy and hierarchy because you just need it,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cA fintech with five or six people can move at speed.\u201d\n\n'Afterpaying' part of the lingo\n\nThis is evident at Melbourne\u2019s Afterpay, which in just four years made the shift from start-up to verb. Go shopping with a Millennial and you\u2019ll likely hear them talk of \u201cAfterpaying\u201d a jacket or a dress.\n\nAfterpay allows consumers to buy a relatively low-value product (the average retail price is $150) with a 25 per cent deposit and take it immediately. The remainder is paid off in three further instalments over six weeks. It\u2019s lay-by for those who don\u2019t want to wait.\n\nThe retailer pays Afterpay a commission, and the firm will charge customers late fees \u2013 but, importantly, not interest. This means Afterpay is not regulated as a credit provider, and instead markets itself as a budgeting tool aimed at the two-thirds of Millennials who don\u2019t own a credit card.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe growth of the firm has been stunning: almost 18,000 retailers now offer the payment option, and it claims 2.3 million active customers. In August, Afterpay announced its underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (the number the market is looking at, given net profit is dragged down by non-cash items associated with the firm\u2019s rapid growth) had jumped 468 per cent in 2017-18 to $33.8 million. Underlying sales processed through its system soared 290 per cent to $2.18 billion.\n\n\u201cI often joke our market research was actually trying to get a loan,\u201d Prospa's Greg Moshal says. James Brickwood\n\nThe five-fold rise in its share price over the past 12 months means the company has attracted its doubters, led by some badly burnt but persistent short sellers. The great fear is that Afterpay\u2019s growth will bring with it a rise in bad debts. So far, that hasn\u2019t happened. Indeed in 2017-18, net transaction losses (the Afterpay version of bad debts) fell across the year from 0.6 per cent of underlying sales to 0.4 per cent.\n\nEisen and Molnar met as neighbours\n\nCo-founders Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar talk as much about managing risk as growing the business. \u201cFrom day one we were just as focused on risks and losses as we were on getting the product out there,\u201d says Eisen.\n\nEisen and Molnar make a bit of an odd couple. Molnar, who went to the University of Sydney on a rugby scholarship and has the official title of chief executive, fits the stereotype of the dashing tech entrepreneur best. Eisen, who is executive chairman, is more reserved. He\u2019s passionate about the business, and protective of it too.\n\nThe pair first met as neighbours in Sydney; Eisen, then the chief investment officer at Guinness Peat Group, spied Molnar working away late at nights at his online jewellery business. They met on the footpath and Eisen detected a budding entrepreneur. He introduced Molnar to his business contacts, including John Wylie, the corporate adviser. Wylie, in turn, introduced Molnar to venture capitalist Mark Carnegie, who tutored him. As Molnar\u2019s jewellery business grew, a problem nagged: how to convert more visitors to sales. He intuitively knew Millennials had an aversion to credit cards, and had a hunch they would be more likely to buy something if they could pay for it over several weeks. Afterpay was the solution.\n\nThe simplicity of the app is surprising. Standing in a store in Melbourne\u2019s Burke Street, I create an account by scrolling through four screens. I enter my personal details, scan my debit card and then I can either start shopping online or request a barcode that the shop assistant can scan in-store. In just a few minutes I\u2019ve got $500 to spend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo-frills boardroom\n\nOur interview provides a neat example of Afterpay\u2019s ambitious growth strategy beyond its home market. Eisen sits in the no-frills Melbourne boardroom, while Molnar is on the phone from San Francisco, and group head David Hancock is on a video call from Sydney.\n\nMolnar is steering the company\u2019s three-month-old US expansion and says the trends that underpin the use of Afterpay in Australia \u2013 namely Millennials\u2019 disdain for credit cards \u2013 resonate with Americans too. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 150,000 customers within three months of going live, which is a great start, but there\u2019s still a way to go,\u201d he says.\n\nMore than 800 American retailers have been signed up so far, with over 400 transacting on the platform, led by launch partner Urban Outfitters. Underlying sales were $12 million in June and then jumped to $20 million in July. The peak US retail season, from Thanksgiving in late November through to Christmas, lies ahead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 150,000 customers within three months of going live [in the US],\" says Afterpay co-founder Nick Molnar. Louie Douvis\n\nIf investors are thrilled with the US expansion, they appear to be more circumspect about the company\u2019s push into Britain, announced in August and seeded with the acquisition of a small firm operating in Britain\u2019s buy-now-pay-later space. The shares fell as investors wondered whether Afterpay can handle a dual-pronged overseas push so early in its life, and all while its Australian business is still ramping up.\n\nEisen insists the risks of the international growth strategy have been reduced by partnering with local retailers, such as Trade Me in New Zealand and Urban Outfitters in the US. In the UK, Afterpay has made a small acquisition to allow it to set up in the country faster. \u201cIt\u2019s not just expansion for expansion sake,\u201d he argues.\n\nOver the past 12 months, the company has made a string of key hires, including bringing on Uber\u2019s former chief risk officer Xin Ge, the former chief executive of retail chain T2, Rachel Kelly, and former UBS high frequency trading expert Jon Donoghue. Perhaps the biggest coup came in January when US venture capital firm Matrix Partners took a stake in Afterpay, and Matrix partner Dana Stalder joined the board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the rise of Afterpay\u2019s share price, the company didn\u2019t really need Matrix\u2019s money. What it wanted was US knowledge and Stalder\u2019s connections, which would help the Australian firm hold its own in Silicon Valley\u2019s white-hot jobs market. \u201cOne of the key rationales for working with Matrix and bringing Dana on our board was to attract some of the best talent in the United States,\u201d Molnar says.\n\nAnother crucial piece of the puzzle has been making sure Afterpay\u2019s tech platform is up to scratch. Eisen says the company is now in a position to scale in a way that couldn\u2019t have been contemplated 12 months ago.\n\nOriginal low-doc lender\n\nJames Boyle, the chief executive of non-bank lender Liberty, could be forgiven for watching the fintech army invading the Australian market and thinking: been there, done that. His firm was a disrupter long before anyone used the term.\n\nEstablished 21 years ago by a former Credit Suisse and McKinsey executive named Sherman Ma \u2013 himself a member of the very first Young Rich List back in 2003 \u2013 Liberty was the first in the market to offer low-doc lending in Australia and has withstood the various cycles of the market.\n\nWhile that core product hasn\u2019t changed, Liberty\u2019s importance to the property sector has. When, in March 2017, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority moved to cool the housing market by imposing caps on the Big Four banks\u2019 growth in mortgages \u2013 particularly the interest-only loans long favoured by property investors \u2013 the likes of Liberty, La Trobe Financial and Pepper Group stepped into the breach.\n\nAfterpay\u2019s executive team David Hancock, Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar.\n\nThis sector, similar to fintech but comparatively overlooked, has some powerful new backers. In August 2017, KKR, the fabled New York-based private equity firm, bought out Pepper. Four months later Blackstone, a rival private equity firm, bought 80 per cent of La Trobe Financial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpportunity and competition growing\n\nThese \u201cshadow bank lenders\u201d have been in the sector\u2019s margins for decades, offering mortgages and other loans to people who can\u2019t get finance from banks. Now that regulators are tightening the reins on mortgages, there\u2019s a lot more of those people to serve. \u201cWhat we do as non-banks, and what Liberty does, hasn\u2019t actually changed over that period,\u201d says Boyle. \u201cBut our relevance has changed a lot.\u201d\n\nBoyle can see room to grow further in the coming years, as the banks deal with the twin problems of the royal commission and its fallout, and embark on complicated internal clean-ups that will see them offload troubled business units, such as their wealth divisions.\n\n\u201cI suspect in the short term there is probably more opportunity, not less, for us,\u201d says Boyle. \u201cBut equally, in the medium term, we will be facing some very strong competition from these same institutions, as they clear current hurdles and become laser-focused on these markets they\u2019ve chosen.\u201d\n\nFor now, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to go around for both the old-school shadow lenders, and the new-school fintech start-ups. Indeed, they are embracing each other. In January, Liberty acquired online personal lender MoneyPlace for an undisclosed sum. Three years ago it grabbed a stake in online business lender Moula in return for $30 million of debt and equity funding. \u201cThe fintech community has been a great source of some really good ideas that we\u2019ve implemented,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cWe embrace that community knowing that we can\u2019t come up with best ideas and best technologies in a vacuum.\u201d\n\nDisrupters as saviours\n\nIt\u2019s a model that\u2019s familiar to Ian Pollari, the national leader of KPMG\u2019s Australian banking practice and the co-leader of its global fintech practice. At first, many inside the big banks feared fintechs could do to them what Uber did to taxi companies. But Pollari says it wasn\u2019t long until the disrupters were seen as potential saviours. With the banks facing rising costs and increasing compliance costs, they quickly figured out that nimble fintechs could help provide solutions.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, fintechs are quickly coming to appreciate that banks have one thing they don\u2019t: a lot of customers. \u201cStarting a new fintech and getting some early adoption from some customers is not enough to ensure their sustainability,\u201d Pollari says. \u201cFor some of them, the reality will dawn that the only way to scale will be to partner with banks and other established players, because they\u2019ve got customers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis trend is already playing out among the big four. Westpac has a stake in online personal lender Zip Co, and has invested in a swag of other start-ups through its investment vehicle Reinventure, including SocietyOne, which in September became the first peer-to-peer lender to break through $500 million in loans. NAB has a $100 million venture capital fund, while ANZ has a stake in fintech platform Data Republic. Commonwealth Bank has taken a different path, focusing on building internal and less formal links with the fintech community.\n\n\u201cThe only way to scale will be to partner with banks and other established players, because they\u2019ve got customers,\" says Ian Pollari, KPMG's co-leader of global fintech. Ryan Stuart\n\nAs for Afterpay and Prospa, they\u2019ve scaled up so quickly that thorny issues have emerged. When you lend money, reputational issues are never far away and Afterpay has been criticised for creating a potential debt trap for younger consumers, and Eisen and Molnar are sensitive to the claims.\n\nModel 'not predatory'\n\nTo counter negative press, the company has retained economist Andrew Charlton \u2013 best known as a former adviser to Kevin Rudd \u2013 to conduct a rolling review of its customer base. The research is used liberally in company documents, including its recent results presentation, and argues the model is far from predatory.\n\nAbout 95 per cent of instalment payments don\u2019t incur a late fee; about 80 per cent of customers have never paid a late fee; and late fees account for just 1.3 per cent of underlying sales. Protections have been built into the Afterpay model, too. Customers that fall behind in their payment are immediately booted off the platform and last year the company capped late fees at the lesser of 25 per cent of the order value, or $68.\n\nAnd after a report from proxy advisers Ownership Matters highlighted clear problems with underage consumers buying alcohol, Afterpay also introduced an enhanced third-party ID verification system.\n\nMeanwhile, Prospa knows only too well the risk of regulatory intervention. In September, three months after its aborted float on the ASX, Prospa and ASIC forged an agreement whereby the lender agreed to remove certain unfair contract terms, effectively bringing it in line with the major banks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal with ASIC has become the template the regulator wants to roll out across the fintech small-business space. Beau Bertoli bristles slightly at the suggestion this was a milestone for Prospa; he argues the company has worked closely with the regulator, and many of the contract terms removed were never relied upon. \u201cIt\u2019s important to say none of the changes had a commercial or financial or even operational impact on the business,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen the cycle turns...\n\nThe big question facing fintechs is how they might fare across the cycle \u2013 in an environment of rising interest rates, for example, or when the bottom falls out of the economy, or if a shock to the financial system forces up the cost of money. Shadow lenders had to shut themselves to new customers after the GFC, and some disappeared altogether.\n\nThe rapid growth of Prospa and Afterpay \u2013 and of their founders\u2019 fortunes \u2013 has come during a period of unique tailwinds, including the turmoil in the banking sector, stronger economic growth and bullishness about tech companies all over the world.\n\nProspa, which is considered likely to try to float in the next 12 months, will remain focused on the small business market, and is already testing more credit products, such as overdrafts. Bertoli and Moshal are also pushing into New Zealand.\n\nThe international prospects of Afterpay, whose market value fluctuates around $4 billion, look even stronger. If the early success in the US can continue, and it can handle the added pressure of the push into Britain, it\u2019s not hard to imagine its transaction numbers and retailer base growing sharply. With a fortune estimated at $341 million, Molnar already qualifies for being not only on the list of Young Rich but on the Rich List itself. And he\u2019s unlikely to be the only person from fintech to make the cut.\n\nThe AFR Magazine Young Rich issue is out on Friday October 26 inside The Australian Financial Review.\n\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram", "description": "As banks retreat and technology advances, a cohort of Young Rich fintech entrepreneurs is emerging.
