Why did I do this? Well, one reason would be, \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nWith the release of the Shadowkeep expansion, I started the game afresh in solidarity with my friends, who are playing the free-to-play New Light mode. So I haven\u2019t progressed far into the game, and I haven\u2019t accumulated much loot. However, I possess an urgent need to create content.\n\nTherefore: I read a lot of gun names. For you! (Also, for me. It was fun.)\n\nBungie, if you\u2019re listening: consider this my audition for the role of Gunfather in Destiny 3.\n\nBy the way! If you personally liked, commented, and / or subscribed to our YouTube channel, that would definitely fuel my habit of making a lot more videos like this. I promise you might love it.\n\nThere\u2019s even a playlist of all my other videos. Wow!", "description": "I performed a dramatic reading of the names of 400 guns from Destiny 2. Why did I do this?
