The deal is still subject to acceptance from the councils.\n\nAGL CEO Brett Redman has shifted to a smaller scale entry into data services. Janie Barrett\n\nAGL chief executive Brett Redman said the utility's first step into the broadband and data sector \"builds on our strong regional presence as an energy retailer and SPC\u2019s telecommunication services and capabilities.\"\n\n\u201cThe acquisition allows us to create space for new products and services that meet the needs of increasingly connected customers as energy and data converge,\" Mr Redman said.\n\nAGL signalled at its full-year results in August that it was pursuing alternative options to expand into data services after dropping the takeover approach for Vocus in June. The Vocus approach was widely regarded by AGL investors as a high-risk deal although AGL said at the time that negative feedback hadn't been a factor in the decision to walk away, rather than the company was no longer confident that an acquisition on the proposed terms would create value for shareholders.", "description": "The regional telco player offers a smaller scale entry into data provision for households.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2354%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8c1323143877911fb82ec3c9a1faf41c4c99a1d2", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
