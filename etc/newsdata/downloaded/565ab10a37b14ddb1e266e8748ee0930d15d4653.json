Each home (one to three bedrooms), comes fully furnished with 24-hour on-site security, walk-in closets, bathrooms with plasma TVs and kitchens with marble countertops and metallic-painted cabinetry. The modern interiors include stylish sofas, dining tables and high-end bedroom furniture. Luxurious wallpaper, flooring and finishes are found throughout. Each dwelling has two dedicated parking spaces. Prices range from \u00a3550,000 to \u00a31.6 million (about $668,000 to $1.9 million).\n\nIn addition to the 11 condos carved out of the main house, Yogo Group is building 11 homes on the estate that will complement the existing landmark building. These include three four-bedroom townhouses and six mews houses and two penthouses. According to Yogo, the ongoing transformation of Osidge will be Phase 2 of the project. The newly built homes are Phase 1. There will be 22 homes between the two.\n\n\u201cIt has taken them less than a year to build the townhouses, mews houses (carriage houses) and penthouses as these are all new builds,\u201d Debbie Schogger, a PR specialist for Yogo Group, wrote in an email. \u201cBuilding Osidge took longer as they had to get further planning permission, and these apartments are due to be finished by the end of 2019 or beginning of next year at the latest.\u201d\n\nPhase 2 has more traditional features.\n\n\u201cThe new builds (townhouses, penthouses and mews houses) are all super modern and fully furnished and interior designed to a very clean spec. Phase 2 will keep the exact character of the house,\u201d Schogger wrote. \u201cThe bathroom tiles will be the exact same as how they were when Sir Thomas Lipton lived there, the wooden beams and the internal walls are the same, the bannisters are all the originals, as are the cornices, windows and brickwork. Not much was allowed to be changed or modified, so it has all been restored and re-created.\u201d\n\nThe Phase 1 homes are on the market. They have Lutron mood lighting, a Sonos sound system, underfloor heating, and Italian kitchens and closets. Prices range from a two-bedroom, 1,350-square-foot carriage house for \u00a31,080,000 (about $1.3 million), to a four-bedroom 2,200-square-foot townhouse for \u00a31,800,000 (about $2.2 million). Three of the 11 homes in Phase 1 are under contract.\n\nThe sprawling five-acre estate offers privacy as well as ample greenery, but the location is still convenient. The Lipton Estate is in London\u2019s Southgate neighborhood, a suburban area north of the city. The Southgate tube station is on the Piccadilly Line and within a five-minute walk. The development is close to many restaurants and schools. London City Airport is a 36-minute drive, and Heathrow is about 45 minutes away.\n\nIt\u2019s said Sir Thomas Lipton didn\u2019t expect to love living in London, but in Osidge, he found an oasis of calm that he enjoyed coming back to. The Lipton Estate could be a London respite for homeowners seeking a similar sense of peace that comforted Sir Thomas generations ago.\n\nAD", "description": "Tea titan's estate is being carved into condos, townhouses and mews houses by London developer.", "authors": ["Nina Zafar", "Reporter", "Editorial Aide For Reliable Source"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QV35pmrS1xdkd3VJ3btH9A3_9us=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XDGGSWKRMI6TPQF65VMJ3DBRQ.jpg"}
