She was known as the \u201cBlue Girl\u201d on social media after the colours of her favourite Iranian soccer team, Esteghlal.\n\nIran opens door to women at football but will anything really change? Read more\n\nShe set herself on fire last week, reportedly after learning she may be imprisoned for trying to enter Tehran\u2019s Azadi (freedom) stadium, in March, to watch an Esteghlal match. She was reportedly posing as a man and was wearing a blue hairpiece and a long overcoat when the police stopped her.\n\nShe spent three nights in jail before being released, pending the court case.\n\nNo verdict had yet been delivered in her case. There were reports Khodayari, a computer sciences graduate, had attempted to take her life once before, while in university.\n\nHer sister had told an Iranian state news outlet that Khodayari had a mental health condition and was receiving treatment, a mitigating factor that would have allowed authorities to drop the charges if they chose.\n\nEsteghlal issued a statement, offering condolences to Khodayari\u2019s family.\n\nIran has occasionally allowed small numbers of women into football matches \u2013 including a match last year attended by Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino \u2013 but rights groups say these instances have been \u201cpublicity stunts\u201d and that little is being done to dismantle the unofficial ban.\n\nInfantino gave the Iranian government a deadline of 15 July to lay out what steps were being taken to ensure women could attended qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup that will be held in the country from October.\n\n\u201cWhilst we are aware of the challenges and cultural sensitivities, we simply have to continue making progress here, not only because we owe it to women all over the world, but also because we have a responsibility to do so, under the most basic principles set out in the FIFA Statutes,\u201d Infantino wrote in the letter, obtained by the New York-based Centre for Human Rights in Iran.\n\nIran will play its first World Cup qualifier at home at Azadi stadium against Cambodia on 10 October. There has been no announcement about whether women will be permitted to attend, and if not, whether Iran\u2019s football federation will face any sanction.\n\nSeveral members of Sweden\u2019s national women\u2019s team tweeted their outrage at Khodayari\u2019s death. \u201cThis is a tragedy and it can\u2019t continue anymore,\u201d said Kosovare Asllani, the team\u2019s captain. \u201cIt\u2019s time to act and not be silent. We need to help the women of Iran fight against gender apartheid,\u201d she wrote, tagging Fifa\u2019s official account.\n\nThe former Bayern Munich midfielder Ali Karimi, who played 127 matches for Iran and has been a vocal advocate of ending the ban on women, urged Iranians in a tweet to boycott soccer stadiums in protest at Khodayari\u2019s death.\n\nThe Iranian-Armenian soccer player Andranik \u201cAndo\u201d Teymourian, the first Christian to be the captain of Iran\u2019s national squad and an Esteghlal player, said in a tweet that one of Tehran\u2019s major soccer stadiums would be named after Khodayari \u201c in the future\u201d.\n\nThe minister of information and communications technology, Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, described the death as a \u201cbitter incident\u201d.\n\nThe female lawmaker Parvaneh Salahshouri called Khodayari \u201cIran\u2019s Girl\u201d and tweeted: \u201cWe are all responsible.\u201d", "description": "Death of Sahar Khodayari, facing prison for trying to enter stadium, provokes outcry", "authors": ["Michael Safi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9697b53360d5d08434cfe795dc8f7ee8078712f/0_101_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=66955d7b3b518dc958cd8f765a597a64", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
