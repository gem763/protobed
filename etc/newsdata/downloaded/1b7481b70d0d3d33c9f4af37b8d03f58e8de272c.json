FedEx also lowered its revenue outlook.\n\nThe profit warning comes after the company posted an 11% drop in fiscal first-quarter profit driven by weakness in its Express unit, which delivers packages by jets and is being hampered by global trade disruption.\n\nMeanwhile, FedEx's Ground unit, where revenue is growing largely due to carrying more e-commerce packages, is spending heavily on additional transportation costs and equipment rentals to keep up with that demand.\n\nThe company said it is taking more cost-cutting steps to try to offset the weaker environment, including retiring planes and grounding others after the holiday shopping season.\n\n\"The global macro economy continues to soften, and we are taking steps to reduce capacity,\" FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said on Tuesday's earnings call.\n\nShares of FedEx fell more than 9% in after-hours trading Tuesday.\n\nFor the first quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx reported a profit of $745 million, or $2.84 a share, compared with net income of $835 million, or $3.10 a share, a year earlier. Excluding expenses related to its integration of TNT Express, per-share earnings were $3.05.\n\nRevenue declined slightly to $17.05 billion.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of $3.15 a share and $17.06 billion in revenue.\n\nEarnings for the fiscal year ending in May are expected to be between $11 and $13 a share before mark-to-market accounting adjustments and integration expenses. Last year, FedEx posted adjusted earnings of $15.52 a share.\n\nThe weaker outlook comes as shippers and carriers are gearing up for the holiday shopping season, when planning and upgrades will be put to the test as the number of packages surges.\n\nIt also comes as FedEx is in the midst of major reshuffling in the delivery marketplace as demand rises for e-commerce shipments. It will soon start delivering packages seven days a week throughout the entire year instead of just during the holidays, and will bring into its own network nearly all of the two million packages it once handed off to the U.S. Postal Service for delivery to doorsteps. Those added costs are weighing on FedEx's bottom line.\n\nFedEx will also be trying to grow its e-commerce business without delivering packages for the largest online player in the U.S., Amazon.com. FedEx in recent months ended its two major shipping contracts with Amazon, forgoing about $900 million in annual revenue. Instead, FedEx is aligning itself with retailers like Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., as well as other online businesses that compete with Amazon. FedEx recently signed on Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. as a customer, for instance, to deliver the retailer's online orders.\n\nFedEx is continuing to raise prices to offset the higher costs associated with all of the online orders to homes. Next year, it plans to raise rates an average of 4.9% on packages sent through its Express and Ground networks, while imposing a 5.9% rate increase on Freight shipments.\n\nDespite the weakness in the Express division, FedEx continues spending heavily to modernize its air fleet and some processing facilities.\n\nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 17, 2019 18:55 ET (22:55 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
