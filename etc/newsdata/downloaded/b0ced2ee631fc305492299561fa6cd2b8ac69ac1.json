Simms sued the city of San Antonio and now-retired San Antonio Police Department detective Mara Wilson for unspecified damages, alleging that the act was a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of her constitutional rights, and resulted \u201cin significant and lasting harm.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNatalie suffered through a shocking display of what can occur when police power is unchecked,\u201d Dean Malone, an attorney for Simms, told WOAI in 2018. \u201cWe intend to seek full damages available under the law and look forward to presenting Natalie\u2019s horrible experience to a jury.\u201d\n\nBut now, it appears the legal battle may be ending differently than how Malone envisioned. The city is scheduled to vote Thursday on a proposed settlement that would award Simms $205,000, according to an official agenda. Simms and her lawyer have agreed to the sum, the San Antonio Express-News reported, citing a city memo.\n\nThe potential payout offered to Simms, 40, is not the first of its kind in Texas. Last January, officials in Harris County paid $185,000 to a Houston woman who alleged in a federal lawsuit that her constitutional rights were violated when two sheriff\u2019s deputies performed a cavity search on her near a bustling convenience store, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time. In that case, the settlement drew backlash from the woman\u2019s lawyers and advocates, who decried the amount as \u201can injustice,\u201d according to the Chronicle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe San Antonio Police Department, the San Antonio City Attorney\u2019s Office and lawyers for Simms did not respond to requests for comment late Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Simms\u2019s lawsuit, her troubles began as she sat on a curb on that August night waiting for her boyfriend. Simms was perched near the street, talking on her cellphone when police officers descended, the suit said. It was later revealed that officers had been investigating the area after receiving complaints about possible drug activity, the Express-News reported. A police detective reportedly said he had seen Simms, who has a criminal record, and another woman walk beneath a highway underpass where they appeared to sell drugs, according to the Express-News.\n\nFirst, police obtained consent to search Simms\u2019s car, which she gave \u201cknowing that she had done nothing wrong,\u201d court documents said. Meanwhile, a female officer was called to the scene to search Simms and it wasn\u2019t long before Wilson, a department veteran, arrived.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter looking through Simms\u2019s clothing and not finding anything, Wilson, who allegedly did not have a warrant at the time, asked if she could remove the woman\u2019s shorts, making small talk as she continued the search, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cOfficer Wilson was initially talking as if she were sitting down and having a cup of coffee with Natalie,\u201d the suit said. \u201cUnfortunately, this was not a meeting over coffee, and Officer Wilson\u2019s decision as to how to conduct the search was about to take a turn for the worse.\u201d\n\nWilson instructed Simms to \u201cspread your legs,\u201d according to a transcript of dash-cam footage included in the lawsuit. Wilson added, \u201cI\u2019m gonna ask you, do you have anything down here before I reach down here?\u201d\n\nSimms said she didn\u2019t and expressed alarm about Wilson\u2019s intent to examine her vagina, noting that she was on her period. Armed with a flashlight, the officer said she only planned to look, not touch, and \u201cpulled open Natalie\u2019s pants and underwear,\u201d the complaint said. Five other officers, all of whom were men, were nearby, the suit alleged.\n\nThat\u2019s when Wilson noticed the tampon string and pulled, according to the suit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOfficer Wilson did so knowing that Natalie was on her period, and also knowing and seeing that Natalie had a menstrual pad in place,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nStill, Wilson repeatedly asked Simms to confirm she was using a tampon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s full of blood, right?\u201d Simms said. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Wilson responded. \u201cIt looked like it had stuff in there.\u201d\n\nIgnoring Simms\u2019s protests that she didn\u2019t have contraband, Wilson continued her search, at one point even remarking, \u201cYou\u2019re very hairy,\u201d the suit alleged.\n\nThen, Wilson told Simms to turn around and spread her legs again, the complaint said. There was another place she had yet to look.\n\n\u201cOfficer Wilson had violated Natalie vaginally, and now it appeared that she might violate Natalie anally,\u201d the suit said. \u201cShe was doing so without a warrant, with no medical personnel present, and on a public street in view of several people as well as those passing by.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSimms asked multiple times if she could be taken to a police station, but her requests were disregarded, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have nothing, you don\u2019t have anything to worry about, okay, but these are all the places that everybody hides stuff, so this is where we have to search,\u201d Wilson told Simms, according to the transcript. Wilson later testified that she has recovered plastic bags containing drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, tied with string from people\u2019s crotches, the News-Express reported.\n\nIt is unclear if Wilson proceeded with the cavity search of Simms. The complaint said Simms ultimately left in her own car after officers did not find anything illegal in her possession.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven though Natalie was allowed to leave the scene, a part of her dignity and self-worth was left behind,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the complaint, officials said Wilson \u201cdid nothing that violated any of the City\u2019s procedures by searching Ms. Simms in the manner she searched her.\u201d Instead of facing serious punishment such as termination, a notation was made in Wilson\u2019s personnel file, the lawsuit alleged. Wilson retired in May 2017, about nine months after her encounter with Simms, as a 32-year veteran of the department.\n\nAD", "description": "Natalie D.
