Of the 110 individuals, 18 successfully carried out terror attacks, 50 others attempted atrocities and 19 are \u2013 or attempted to become \u2013 Islamist fighters. Thirty-six are Islamist propagandists or recruiters.\n\nMonitored: Hate preacher Anjem Choudary near his home in east London wearing an ankle tag underneath his sock (left)\n\nChoudary was freed last October after serving under half of his five-and-a-half year sentence for inviting support for Islamic State.\n\nThe Daily Mail revealed at the time how he had become \u2018hardened\u2019 in jail and more determined than ever to spread his toxic Islamist propaganda. His militant views became \u2018far more extreme and aggressive\u2019 while locked up and he now regards himself as a \u2018martyr\u2019, according to those who met him in jail.\n\nWhen released, Choudary was subject to strict licence conditions. Initially, he lived in a bail hostel but by May he was back at his family home, where he was pictured wearing an electronic tag on his right ankle.\n\nTwelve months after he was freed, the CEP has assessed his current threat to national security. Researchers monitored the online channels extremists use to communicate with each other and as a propaganda tool to groom and radicalise recruits. The 40-page CEP dossier also cites information from concerned British officials and former members of al-Muhajiroun. Buoyed by Choudary\u2019s release, supporters have now reportedly begun meeting again in London and Luton, where he regularly lectured before his arrest, it says.\n\nThe report states: \u2018Former al-Muhajiroun members drew inspiration from Choudary\u2019s release and started to revitalise the network, even though authorities continue to closely monitor Choudary\u2019s movements and communications. Though Choudary remains under tight surveillance, his release inspired others to revive al-Muhajiroun.\u2019\n\nIan Acheson, a CEP expert who led a 2015 independent government review of Islamist extremism in UK prisons, said: \u2018A year ago, I said that the release of Choudary would continue to represent a serious threat to public safety and unfortunately I have not been proved wrong.\n\n\u2018Even though Choudary has to all intents and purposes been on his best behaviour, individuals and groups that were radicalised by him have been revitalized, thus threatening the UK\u2019s national security. The UK Government\u2019s counter-terrorism strategy needs to address this if we intend unrepentant hate preachers like Choudary to see out their sentences in the community.\u2019", "description": "Father-of-five Anjem Choudary, 52, from east London, is inspiring his network of extremists and poses a renewed terror threat a year after he left jail, an analysis by experts has warned.", "authors": ["Tom Kelly Investigations Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/20/19963842-0-image-a-2_1571600942753.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
