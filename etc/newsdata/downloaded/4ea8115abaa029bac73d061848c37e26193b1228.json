No doubt that growing worries in global equity markets look evident enough to extend more bearishness; which may likely to continue heavy sell offs in different sectors of Nifty. Let\u2019s have a look at the current position of prevailing bearishness in different sectors of Nifty 50.\n\nNifty - Sectoral Indices\n\nI find that the Bank has initiated the sliding stride amid growing volatility, which may result in continuity of sell-off on every upward move. Secondly, Nifty Financial Services, Nifty Infrastructure, Nifty PSU Banks, Nifty Auto, and Nifty Reality have been constantly facing sell-off since the beginning of the trading session on September 24th, 2019.\n\nNo doubt that the steady look evident enough to reflect the growing quantum of a global economic slowdown amid prevailing weakness in different parts of the world. Japanese manufacturing activity shrank at the fastest pace in seven months in September, underscoring the broadening economic impact of the Sino-U.S. trade dispute and keeping policymakers under pressure to step up stimulus.

No doubt that the extending sell-off in U.S. equity indices on September 24th, 2019 may drag down below the level of 2950 during the next two trading session; which will confirm the continuity of downward trend in U.S. equity markets.
