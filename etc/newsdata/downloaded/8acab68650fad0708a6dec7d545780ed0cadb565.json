REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis\n\nThe so-called LCROSS mission was hastily carried out 10 years ago Wednesday in a complex orbital dance of two \u201csuicide\u201d spacecraft and one mapping satellite. It proved a milestone in the discovery of a natural lunar resource that could be key to NASA\u2019s plans for renewed human exploration of the moon and ultimately visits to Mars and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe LCROSS mission was a game changer,\u201d NASA\u2019s chief Jim Bridenstine told Reuters, adding that once water had been found the United States \u201cshould have immediately as a nation changed our direction to the moon so we could figure out how to use it.\u201d\n\nThe agency now has the chance to follow up on the pioneering mission, after Vice President Mike Pence in March ordered NASA to land humans on the lunar surface by 2024, accelerating a goal to colonize the moon as a staging ground for eventual missions to Mars.\n\nBridenstine says the moon holds billions of tons of water ice, although the exact amount and whether it\u2019s present in large chunks of ice or combined with the lunar soil remains unknown. To find out before astronauts arrive on the moon, NASA is working with a handful of companies to put rovers on the lunar surface by 2022.\n\n\u201cWe need next to get on the surface with a rover to prospect for water, drill into it, and determine how suitable it is for extraction,\u201d said Jack Burns, director of the Network for Exploration and Space Science at the University of Colorado.\n\nInstead of launching expensive fuel loads from Earth, scientists say the lunar water could be extracted and broken down into its two main components, hydrogen and oxygen, potentially turning the moon into a fuel arsenal for missions to deeper parts of the solar system.\n\nOPEN KIMONO\n\nWeeks before the LCROSS impact booster struck the moon\u2019s south pole, the mission\u2019s development timeline \u201cwas a bad rush to the finish line,\u201d Tony Colaprete, principal investigator for LCROSS, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make as large of a hole as possible to get as much materials out of the shadows and into the sunlight,\u201d Colaprete said, describing an unusually fast-paced program using technology that had never been used in space before.\n\nEngineers and mission leaders used the business phrase \u201copen kimono\u201d about disclosing company information to characterize the program\u2019s breakneck development speed and the need for clear and open lines of communication between contractors and NASA.\n\n\u201cThat almost became a mantra for the project,\u201d Colaprete said.\n\nThe current lunar program is also \u201cforcing some cultural changes\u201d at NASA, he added, which has undergone a series of high-level management changes and delays with the agency\u2019s commercial crew program, a public-private effort to resume U.S. human spaceflight for the first time since 2011.\n\n\u201cPeople are coming together in a way like they did on LCROSS.\u201d", "description": "A decade after NASA sent a rocket crashing into the moon's south pole, spewing a plume of debris that revealed vast reserves of ice beneath the barren lunar surface, the space agency is racing to pick up where its little-remembered project left off.", "authors": ["Joey Roulette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438958649&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981UT", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
