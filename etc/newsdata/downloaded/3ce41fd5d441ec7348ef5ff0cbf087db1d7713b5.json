The company also plans to install surveillance cameras on its 60-acre campus. Limiting access to manufacturing buildings, where material moves via forklift, can be particularly challenging, Mr. Marten said.\n\nA half-dozen Shepherd employees will soon begin \u201cStop the Bleed\u201d training as part of a national program to teach bystanders how to treat gunshot and other life-threatening wounds before first responders arrive.\n\nThe concerns of small businesses vary widely, said Brink Fidler, president of security-training firm Defend Systems in Nashville, Tenn., which has conducted training programs at dental offices, manufacturers and assisted-living centers, among others. Some business owners worry about how to respond to a disgruntled former colleague, he said. Others fear a domestic dispute spilling into the workplace.\n\nKen Clark, chief executive of Chenal Family Therapy PLC of Little Rock, Ark., with about 110 employees, said therapists became more concerned about safety following the shooting last year of three mental health workers on the campus of a state-operated veterans facility in California. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a workplace similar to yours, all of the sudden you pay attention,\u201d he said.\n\nFiguring out the right steps is challenging for a small, fast-growing company that must weigh, for instance, whether to spend money on active-shooter training or something more business-focused like updating its website, Mr. Clark said. Chenal has installed cameras in patient waiting areas and near building doors in some offices, and hopes to soon roll them out in all 17 locations.\n\nChenal bars clients from bringing weapons to its offices, which have solid-core doors that swing out and are hard to kick in, but employees with appropriate training are free to carry a concealed weapon. Mr. Clark has wrestled with whether he should have a gun.\n\n\u201cI have made what I think is the educated choice: There is more risk in me owning a pistol than in me not having one in the office,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cI am also the kid who gets his foot caught in bike spokes,\u201d he added. \u201cI would be the one shooting myself in the foot.\u201d\n\nDr. Brian Eichenberg, the owner of a plastic-surgery center in Murrieta, Calif., obtained a concealed-weapons permit in 2015, after the San Bernardino shootings. He started locking the front door to his office the following year after he put up a billboard advertising breast augmentations that triggered a death threat.\n\n\u201cI have a .45-caliber handgun,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I never use it anywhere.\u201d\n\nEven if small businesses can\u2019t afford their own security staff, they can develop evacuation plans and safety protocols, said Eric Gandy, deputy chief of the Clearwater, Fla., police department, which has conducted about a dozen training presentations at small businesses in the past year.\n\nAt bigger companies, workers may be unaware of the presence of a shooter, particularly if they work on a separate floor, Chief Gandy said. Smaller companies, with workers located in proximity, may be able to more quickly identify a threat, but employees are likely to have less time to escape. Chief Gandy advises workers to think creatively, which could mean throwing a chair through a window to escape or using a fire extinguisher as an improvised weapon.\n\nAfter a 2015 shooting at a nearby community college, Orenco Systems Inc., a manufacturer of wastewater collection and treatment systems in Sutherlin, Ore., signed up for a service that puts a panic button on workers\u2019 smartphones to more quickly notify authorities, said Senior Vice President Jeff Ball. New employees receive active-shooter training when hired and a refresher every six months.\n\nPotential gun violence isn\u2019t the only safety challenge. KBM-Hogue, a contract office furniture dealer with about 120 employees, in May relocated its corporate headquarters to a less visible space after several incidents involving homeless people unsettled employees.\n\n\u201cWe made the conscious decision to leave that space, to give up the visibility and move across the street ... just to get everybody away from that feeling of being uncomfortable and unsafe,\u201d said Stan Vuckovich, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cSafety shouldn\u2019t factor into making a real-estate decision for your business. It factored in a big way for our business.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ruth Simon at ruth.simon@wsj.com and Chip Cutter at chip.cutter@wsj.com", "description": "Some companies are adding security cameras and replacing open-door policies with buzzers and locks, while others are making tough choices about allowing weapons at work.", "authors": ["Ruth Simon", "Chip Cutter", "Ruth.Simon Wsj.Com", "Chip.Cutter Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109710/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
