Boots is also trying to boost sales of beauty products and of drugs online.\n\nSebastian James, Boots' boss, said: 'I am pleased with the progress that we have made in the re-boot of one of Britain's best-loved retailers. Nevertheless, we are aware that this is a journey and that market headwinds have been strong and look likely to remain so for some time.\n\n'Though we have declined in like-for-like terms this year, I am glad that we have retained share across the board and grown significant share in beauty and pleased with the progress we're making to digitise our pharmacy offer.'\n\nWalgreens said overall revenue for the fourth quarter this year had slightly increased from \u00a326 billion to \u00a326.4 billion.\n\nIt brought its full-year sales to \u00a3106.4 billion, up from \u00a3102.3 billion in 2018. But profits fell from \u00a34.6 billion to \u00a33.5 billion during the period.", "description": "Sales at the chemists' chain fell 2.1 per cent in the three months to August 31, with like-for-like pharmacy sales dropping 1 per cent and retail sales dropping 2.7 per cent.", "authors": ["City", "Finance Reporter For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
