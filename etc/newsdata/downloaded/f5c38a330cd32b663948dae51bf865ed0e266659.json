More frequently he is referred to as Rassie Erasmus\u2019 right-hand man. In reality, their connection runs even deeper,.\n\nIt goes back to their days before professional rugby when they were in the army together and then studying at the University of Free State. \"In the army, you get fairly tight and then we went to university together,\u201d Neinaber said. \u201cRassie stayed on in the army a little longer, he was much better in the army than I was. He was a very good tactician as you can see.\u201d\n\nErasmus also made it as a player with Free State and then the Cats (now the Lions) in Super Rugby while Nienaber became a physiotherapist. Their bond only deepened as they would share wide-ranging discussions as Nienaber worked over Erasmus\u2019 body. \u201cObviously when you\u2019re a player and you\u2019re lying on the bed you have a lot of discussions with the physio because you\u2019re 45 minutes there and there was a lot of rugby discussions then,\u201d Erasmus said. As soon as Erasmus moved into coaching with the Free State Cheetahs in 2004, he appointed Nienaber on his strength and conditioning staff. Slowly, Nienaber was able to shift his focus across to coaching defence, at a time when few teams employed a specialist in that position.", "description": "Jacques Nienaber\u2019s job description is South Africa defence coach.", "authors": ["Daniel Schofield", "Maggie Alphonsi", "Danny Cipriani"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000213184747-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPSGJeyftEP9WNF5nKPELKYi42McaMWzoNEemnW6g8vI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
