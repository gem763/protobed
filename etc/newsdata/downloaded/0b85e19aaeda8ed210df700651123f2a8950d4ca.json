A row of houses in delicate pastel shades lines the curve of the bay in the distance, while the menacing mass of Mont Orgueil Castle \u2013 my eventual destination for the morning \u2013 looms above them, a hulking great guard dog of a thing.\n\nSeveral hundred metres away, a hound gambols happily in the spray; his owner strides behind him, head down, hood up. And that\u2019s it, company-wise.\n\nInspired by the near-perfect solitude, I start to sing, tentatively at first, then less so, crescendo-ing into a full-throated rendition of \u201cBread of Heaven\u201d (well, it is Sunday after all).\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis starkly beautiful strip of beach is on Jersey\u2019s idyllic east coast, and come summer the place will be stacked with bodies sunbathing, swimming and surfing, drawn here by the biggest Channel Island\u2019s sun-soaked climate. But this is late November \u2013 and that means I have the whole coastline pretty much to myself. It is euphoria for a city kid in need of some hermit time.\n\nMy only previous experience of the island was a visit to a university friend during the summer holidays, and I\u2019ll forever associate the place with long, lazy days, driving from beach to beach, paddling, scrambling over rocks and jumping from cliffs into the deep water below. We ate burgers and drank milk fresh from a Jersey cow under a cloudless sky; it was more Enid Blyton novel than real life.\n\nA decade and several seasons later, winter-time Jersey in 2018 offers a different prospect altogether. But one, I\u2019d argue, that\u2019s equally charming.\n\nAs I skip on towards the castle from my drop-off point at the Seymour pub (even out of season the island has a refreshingly regular and reliable roster of buses), the air is fresh yet mild, sun-tipped, on the brink of spring-like. I quickly warm up, stripping off unnecessary winterwear as I go.\n\nA couple of hours later I\u2019m wandering the maze-like grounds of the imposing 800-year-old behemoth. Hiking up a multitude of stairs brings me to Orgueil\u2019s pinnacle \u2013 the view takes in the quaint fishing village of Gorey below, with eye-popping green fields, the supple blue of sky and that bay, an elegant, concave stretch that delicately cups the ocean. Turn around and you can see all the way to France, its shadowy presence partly obscured by cloud.\n\nThe afternoon involves me swapping legs for two wheels as I speed westwards along the coastal bike path from the capital of St Helier to St Brelade\u2019s Bay. There\u2019s a rush to it as I fly along the smooth track, cheeks flushed pink by the wind. The beach is burnished with gold, the promenade alive with pedestrians and fellow cyclists making the most of the clement weather \u2013 it feels more like LA than the UK.\n\nAdrenaline-doused excitement continues in the form of sea kayaking with Absolute Adventures. I\u2019d worried about being cold, but dressed in full wetsuit, boots, windbreaker and beanie, I find I\u2019m unseasonably toasty, especially when the sun fully emerges to set the sea a-glitter. Affable Irish instructor Sean leads me out across the waves \u2013 another benefit of coming off-season is getting a one-on-one tutorial when no one else is bonkers enough to sign up for a November paddle \u2013 and we cruise west, dipping and pulling, dipping and pulling, until we draw up alongside a secluded beach.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s stop here,\u201d Sean says, \u201cand just listen\u201d. There\u2019s nothing save the soft lapping of water on rock and the crooning of myriad birds. We catch sight of a gliding peregrine falcon \u2013 there\u2019s a nest on the nearby cliff \u2013 while just metres away an egret stands patiently to attention as lone sentinel of the cove behind. A little further on we encounter a pair of oystercatchers, their distinctive orange bills popping against the teal ocean backdrop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like this in summer,\u201d Sean says. \u201cThere are so many boats, so many people \u2013 you can\u2019t get up close like this.\u201d\n\nBuoyed by my brush with nature, I zip back into town as the sun descends, turning all to dusky amber, and the bare bulbs strung alongside the path guide my way. The sky fades from denim to midnight as I ride; St Helier is lit up like a fairyland.\n\nThough my day has been charged with heart-racing energy, Jersey has its own inexorable pace of life \u2013 one that cannot be rushed. Time has an elasticity here, as I'd found when hiring my bike that morning: the woman on duty kept up a slow but steady stream of chatter, the whole process taking far longer than need be. It was the same story when I dipped into Moo, a wantonly millennial caf\u00e9 with a focus on healthy eating and signs saying \u201cEat up, babe!\u201d. Customers chatted for what seemed like hours to staff behind the counter while I felt my foot start to tap and my heart rate steadily increase \u2013 when was I going to be served my avocado bagel with chilli and Himalayan sea salt, dammit? But shaking off mainland impatience is all part of the fun \u2013 once you surrender and reset to Jersey time, it\u2019s a relief to be forced to slow down a little.\n\nIf all this talk of leisurely living sounds a bit, well, unsexy, a counterpoint comes in the form of Jersey\u2019s burgeoning nest of trendy bars, designed to appeal to the island\u2019s community of young professionals working in the finance sector. One such venture is Project 52, an \u201cexclusively-inclusive establishment\u201d made up of a members' lounge and public bar that opened two years ago. It\u2019s fiendishly difficult to find, but once I stumble across the entrance down a cobbled backstreet I\u2019m rewarded with a bespoke cocktail from head bartender Chris, who puts my love of tequila to work in the intimate, upscale bar, complete with flattering lighting and hip furniture that looks like it\u2019s straight out of a Made.com advert.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have any history in the bar business,\u201d co-founder Sarah admits. \u201cWe just wanted to create a bar we\u2019d actually like to come to.\u201d\n\nShe, like many of the younger generation of residents, wasn\u2019t born here, but came to stay and never left. I\u2019m starting to relate.\n\nBefore I leave the next day, I duck into the Jersey War Tunnels, an attraction which charts the Nazi invasion of the island during the Second World War with a range of genuinely fascinating interactive exhibits strewn across more than 1,000m of underground tunnels. The invading force felt like they were on a permanent summer holiday in Jersey, and it\u2019s easy to see why, even in winter, as I later stroll past palm trees and Mediterranean-style shrubbery, all of it more Mallorcan-looking than British.\n\nThe only difference is that in winter there\u2019s no queue to enter the tunnels; no problem getting a seat on the bus; no wait at the bar to sink a mulled cider before my flight. Summer may bring guaranteed sun, but it also brings guaranteed people.\n\nOff-season Jersey, meanwhile, has it all for the entry-level loner \u2013 a different kind of winter sun, and not a soul in sight.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nBritish Airways flies from London Gatwick to Jersey from \u00a368 return.\n\nStaying there\n\nThe four-star Pomme d'Or in St Helier offers comfortable rooms in a prime location, and guests get free access to the spa and gym facilities at sister property the Merton Hotel. Doubles from \u00a3105, room only.\n\nMore information\n\nA Sea Kayak Tour with Absolute Adventures costs \u00a338pp for two hours, including all gear. Bike Hire with Zebra Car & Cycle Hire is \u00a316 for a day.\n\njersey.com", "description": "Standing on a ribbon of mustard sand, the muted petrol blue of the sea mirroring the sky, I feel utterly remote.
