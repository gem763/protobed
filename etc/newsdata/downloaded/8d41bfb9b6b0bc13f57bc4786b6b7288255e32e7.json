He\u2019s going around talking to people. If he\u2019s good with it, I\u2019m good with it,\u201d Graham said of the memo.\n\nThe memo, titled, \u201cIdea for New Unlicensed-Commercial-Sale Background Checks,\u201d proposes expanding background checks to all advertised commercial sales, including sales at guns shows, along the lines of the Manchin-Toomey proposal.\n\nThe document was first reported on by The Daily Caller.\n\nToomey, a lead Republican negotiator on expanding background checks, told reporters Wednesday that Barr, not the White House, drafted the memo.\n\n\"I have spoken with the attorney general. I think I have a pretty good idea of what he has in mind. I think it's a very thoughtful, very constructive, very creative way to accomplish some important goals,\" Toomey said.\n\n\"I think a number of things are still in a work in progress, to some degree,\" he added.\n\nThe memo floats the idea of conducting background checks for all commercial sales either through a federally licensed firearms dealer or a newly created class of licensed transfer agents.\n\nLicensed transfer agents would not have an inventory of guns to sell but would be authorized by the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco to conduct background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).\n\nUnder the proposal, all commercial gun sales would produce two forms, a bill of sale that would record the details of the sale, and a certification from either a licensed firearms dealer or transfer agent recording that a successful background check has taken place.\n\nIf someone who attempts to buy a firearm fails a background check, that would be reported to law enforcement officials.\n\nIf the buyer passes the background check and purchases the firearm, the person who sells the gun would receive a copy of the form certifying that a successful background check was performed. Licensed gun dealers and transfer agents would not maintain these records, a provision intended to allay fears by Second Amendment advocates that the proposal could lead to the creation of a federal firearms registry.\n\nThe record-keeping requirements of the proposal would be enforced by civil penalties. People who sell guns would be granted the same civil immunity as federally licensed firearms dealers, according to the memo.\n\nSen.

What is the president going to put forward?\u201d Hawley told reporters.\n\nAsked about the specifics of the memo, Hawley said, \"I need to evaluate it. It's more sort of a, I don't want to say thought experiment ... but it's more in the way that here's some ideas that one could turn into a concrete proposal.\"\n\nHawley said Barr appears to be more brainstorming with GOP senators on expanded background checks instead of actively trying to sell them on the new ideas.\n\nSen.

The president hasn\u2019t endorsed it, and there\u2019s some question about when the president might actually do that,\u201d he said.\n\nSen.

It\u2019s hard to know whether this is constructive or not,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy said he plans to speak to White House officials Wednesday afternoon.\n\nSen.

Is it really going to prevent any of these [mass shootings?] No,\u201d he said.\n\nUeland on Wednesday declined to say which White House officials were involved in drafting the ideas sheet.\n\n\u201cThe president has asked us to respond and listen to perspectives, views, opinion and ideas, and tips, from members of Congress and that\u2019s what we continue to do here,\u201d he told reporters.", "description": "Senate Republicans are responding cautiously to a new proposal to expand background checks for gun sales that the Trump administration is circulating on Capitol Hill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_09172019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
