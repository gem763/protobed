We are not expecting any significant flooding concerns whatsoever as Nestor moves inland later through tonight.\u201d\n\nThreats of severe weather were forecast to end on Sunday night, for a dry start to the work week.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the weekend, Nestor will be pulling away from the East Coast. The low pressure system associated with Nestor will move out to sea and should no longer be a significant threat to the United States,\u201d Orrison said.", "description": "Post-tropical cyclone Nestor made landfall in Florida on Saturday afternoon, bringing tornadoes that downed trees and shredded roofs in Gulf Coast towns and a storm surge that washed over streets.", "authors": ["Barbara Goldberg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
