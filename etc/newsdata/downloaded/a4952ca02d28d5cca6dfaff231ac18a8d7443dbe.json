Pleads for Money As Finances Poised to Run Dry", "language": "en", "text": "The United Nations is running a deficit of $230 million, Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday, and may run out of money by the end of October unless world governments immediately meet their financial obligations.\n\nU.S. taxpayers would most likely be hardest hit by any immediate cash injection into the global organization.\n\nThe United States is by far the U.N.\u2019s biggest financial contributor, providing 22 percent of its operating budget and funding 28 percent of peacekeeping missions, which currently cost $8 billion annually.\n\nThe next two major contributors are Germany and the U.K.\n\nIn a letter intended for the 37,000 employees at the U.N. secretariat and obtained by AFP, Guterres said unspecified, \u201cadditional stop-gap measures\u201d would have to be taken to ensure salaries and entitilements are met.\n\nThese might include holding less meetings and cutting back on travel and associated entitlements.\n\n\u201cMember States have paid only 70 per cent of the total amount needed for our regular budget operations in 2019. This translates into a cash shortage of $230 million at the end of September. We run the risk of depleting our backup liquidity reserves by the end of the month,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDonald Trump has long pushed for reform of the U.N. and in December 2017 Nikki Haley, the then United States Ambassador to the organization, announced the federal government had reduced its contribution to the U.N.\u2019s annual budget by $285 million, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nHaley\u2019s statement came after the U.N. voted to condemn the United States for President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The resolution, backed by nations with long records of extreme human rights abuses, passed 128-9. Haley immediately responded by threatening to reduce America\u2019s U.N. funding.\n\n\u201cThe United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,\u201d Haley told the assembly in New York City.\n\n\u201cWe will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world\u2019s largest contribution to the United Nations and we will remember it when so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.\u201d\n\nAFP contributed to this story", "description": "The U.N. is running a deficit of $230 million, Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday, and may soon run out of money.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/02/Antonio-Guterres.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
