On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the Fair Pay to Play Act, which would allow college athletes to be compensated for the usage of their likeness and name. Under current NCAA rules, athletes are prohibited from being paid for any endorsements. Lawmakers from other states, including Florida and New York, have proposed bills similar to California\u2019s.\n\nIn the meantime, colleges\u2019 recruitment of the top football and basketball players has become a huge spectator sport in its own right. That Christopher ranks ranks 12th on ESPN\u2019s list of top-100 prospects in the 2020 class, and has received offers from Michigan, Arizona State, Missouri, and UCLA but chose to visit Howard speaks volumes. He\u2019s not the only highly recruited prospect planning to do so. Makur Maker, a 6-foot-11 center who is 10th on ESPN\u2019s list, is expected to make a visit to Howard during the school\u2019s homecoming weekend later this month.\n\nEven if neither of them decides to attend Howard in the end, the fact that they have shown serious interest in the school could encourage other high school players to do the same. It could be only a matter of time before a top-tier player commits.\n\n\u201cI think I have pretty good influence on kids right now, especially basketball players,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cMy main thing is to make sure that whoever is watching me is getting the right stuff. I know there are a lot of kids that have told me they look up to me that are inspired by me.\u201d He adds, \u201cNot all kids can go to the Kentuckys and the Dukes and all the other high-major programs that are on ESPN every night.\u201d\n\nLast month, I wrote an essay urging the most promising African American prep stars\u2014including athletes like Christopher and Maker\u2014to eschew big-name schools and instead attend historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. Other than helping to revitalize institutions that once were the nerve center of black America, athletes who sign at HBCUs could see some personal financial opportunities.\n\nMost African Americans support paying college players, Some commentators have already proposed that HBCUs going forward abandon the NCAA and create their own pay-for-play league. If California\u2019s new law represents a looming change in the financial structure of college sports, HBCUs are in a position to further advance the conversation about equity for athletes.\n\nAs it stands, HBCUs have struggled to compete in this modern era of college sports. Most don\u2019t have the facilities or generate the same media attention as the major college programs. But audience and attention will follow the talent. Laron Christopher, Joshua\u2019s father, isn\u2019t worried that his son will miss out on anything if he decides to commit to Howard.", "description": "With intercollegiate athletics under intense scrutiny, the basketball phenom Josh Christopher considers taking his talents to a historically black school.", "authors": ["Jemele Hill", "Staff Writer For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_1168815432/facebook.jpg?1569983682"}
