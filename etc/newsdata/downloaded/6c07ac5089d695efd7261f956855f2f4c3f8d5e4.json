Her work, highly Instagrammable, is refreshingly unique, with lots of antiques, modernist furniture, and bright, eye-catching photography, all pleasingly arranged. Ashby\u2019s diverse roster of projects include a luxury boutique hotel in South Africa, a penthouse in Battersea, and a rambling country house in Somerset for the actress Gabriella Wilde. She\u2019s just getting started.\n\nAshby, who is half South African and half English, founded her studio in 2014 at the age of 25. Her rooms, both warm and chic, are the kind of places in which one would wish to read a long book, or enjoy a vinyl record, or just sip a gin-and-tonic and appreciate the art.\n\nWe reached out to hear what the up-and-coming designer includes as some of her favorite things in the world.\n\nMy favourite neighbourhood in the world is\u2026 London, which I\u2019m lucky enough to call home, but specifically Marylebone, which has it all! First, a morning stroll in Regent\u2019s Park. For lunch, Honey & Co, a restaurant that is all about taste and love. Afternoon would be spent shopping at two of my favourite shops on Chiltern Street, Casely-Hayford (my husband\u2019s shop and where I get most of my clothes) and Mouki Mou. Next a visit to the Wallace Collection for boundless inspiration followed by a pre-dinner drink at Chiltern Firehouse in the hotel bar or in the magical courtyard, then dinner at Opso, a delicious Greek restaurant.\n\nThe one thing in my kitchen/closet I can\u2019t live without is... my Clementina Ceramics mugs from Cape Town. I take such pleasure in drinking from them every morning.\n\nIf I were to buy a piece of art, it would be by\u2026 if money were no object, today it would be the Young Bird sculpture by Brancusi. But to choose one piece feels like an impossible challenge.\n\nThe best book I\u2019ve read in the last year is... A Little Life by Hana Yanagihara \u2014unforgettable, moving, devastating, triumphant.A passion of mine that few people know about is... giving new life to old things. We\u2019re creating a collection of products made from the waste we create through interior design, like fabric scraps and offcuts and turning them into new pieces to cherish.\n\nThe one trip I\u2019ve taken that I would love to do again... my husband proposed to me on the Amalfi coast, we stayed at the most exquisite hotel, Monstera Santa Rosa. I will never forget the view from our breakfast table, just a wall of blue sea. I would go back there every year, drink freshly squeezed, ice-cold orange juice and stare at the horizon.\n\nThe next destination on my travel itinerary is... Ischia. My husband and I are going there for a long weekend to celebrate our one-year anniversary and we are staying at the Mezzatorre Hotel. I love everything about the Pellicano hotels, the design is beautiful, the settings always magical and Italian food is my absolute favourite.\n\nThe thing that gets me up in the morning is... a cup of tea.\n\nThe restaurant in my hometown that I love to take a visitor is... Somerset House. I am biased because my sister is the head-chef, but it\u2019s absolutely delicious and you dine in the splendour of an old grand room in Somerset House with high ceilings and huge windows. The service is incredible too.\n\nA person who inspired me to do what I do is... a childhood friend\u2019s mother who had the most beautiful homes that she\u2019d designed; I was lucky enough to spend time in a few of them, from a farm in Somerset to a riad in Marrakech, her eye for color and pattern, her sense of fun and ability to tie all sorts of eclectic finds together in the most comfortable, cosy way, was brilliant.\n\nIf I could have a drink with anybody, anywhere, it would be... somewhere with old-world glamour like Claridges, London, with my mother\u2019s parents. I never met them and they sounded wonderful.", "description": "The Studio Ashby founder loves London\u2019s Marylebone neighborhood, A Little Life, the Amalfi coast, and more", "authors": ["Brent Crane"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-115382/social", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
