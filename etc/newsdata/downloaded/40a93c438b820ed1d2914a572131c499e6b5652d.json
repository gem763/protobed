In 2017, an estimated 1.7 million individuals in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers and 652,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder.\n\nOpioids are drugs formulated to replicate the pain-educing properties of opium. They include both legal painkillers like morphine, oxycodone, or hydrocodone prescribed by doctors for acute or chronic pain, as well as illegal drugs like heroin or illicitly made fentanyl. The word \"opioid\" is derived from the word \"opium.\"\n\nDuring 2017, there were more than 70,200 overdose deaths in the United States and 47,600 of thoseoverdose deaths involved opioids. More than 130 people died every day from opioid-related drug overdoses in 2016 and 2017, according to the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS).\n\nPrescription opioid volumes peaked in 2011, with the equivalent of 240 billion milligrams of morphine prescribed , according to the market research firm, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. The volume declined to about 171 billion milligrams of morphine in 2017, a 29% drop.\n\nCommon opioids:\n\nThey also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a \"high.\" Opioids bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting pain signals. They also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a \"high.\"\n\nHydrocodone and oxycodone are semi-synthetic opioids, manufactured in labs with natural and synthetic ingredients. Between 2007 and 2016, the most widely prescribed opioid was hydrocodone (Vicodin). In 2016, 6.2 billion hydrocodone pills were distributed nationwide. The second most prevalent opioid was oxycodone (Percocet). In 2016, 5 billion oxycodone tablets were distributed in the United States, according to IQVIA.\n\nAccording to two national surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, covering 78,000 visits to emergency rooms and outpatient clinics by teens and young adults between 2005 and 2015, 15% of ER visits and three percent of outpatient visits resulted in an opioid prescription.\n\nThe International Narcotics Control Board reported that in 2015, Americans represented about 99.7% of the world's hydrocodone consumption.\n\nMethadone is another fully synthetic opioid. It is commonly dispensed to recovering heroin addicts to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.\n\nState legislatures are also introducing measures to regulate pain clinics and limit the quantity of opioids that doctors can dispense.\n\nMultiple opioid-related lawsuits have been filed by states, counties, cities and tribes.\n\nEmergence of a crisis:\n\n1861-1865 - During the Civil War, medics use morphine as a battlefield anesthetic.
