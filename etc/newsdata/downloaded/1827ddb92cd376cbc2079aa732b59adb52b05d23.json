You should have called me the first time this happened.\"\n\nBecky added a broken heart emoji to the bottom of her statement.\n\nIt came just minutes after Coleen shared a statement to her Twitter and Instagram eviscerating Vardy for allegedly flogging stories about her to a newspaper.\n\n\"For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing the sun newspaper of my private posts and stories,\" Coleen wrote.\n\n\n\n\"There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n\"After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\"To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account (those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe mum of four went on: \"Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n\"The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\n\n\"It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n\n\n\"Now I know for certain which account / individual it's come from. I have saved and screens hotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.\"", "description": "Rebekah Vardy has hit back at Coleen Rooney's accusations that she's been selling stories to a newspaper about the Rooneys' private life", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Instagram", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11808214.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/MAIN-Rebekah-Vardy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
