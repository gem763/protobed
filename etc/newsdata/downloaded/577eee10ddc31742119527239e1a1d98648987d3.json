But the torment for Nozaki and his fellow fishermen didn\u2019t end there. The resulting triple meltdown at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people and sent a plume of radiation into the air and sea.\n\nIt also came close to crippling the region\u2019s fishing industry.\n\nHaving spent the past eight years rebuilding, the Fukushima fishing fleet is now confronting yet another menace \u2013 the increasing likelihood that the nuclear plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), will dump huge quantities of radioactive water into the ocean.\n\n\u201cWe strongly oppose any plans to discharge the water into the sea,\u201d Nozaki, head of Fukushima prefecture\u2019s federation of fisheries cooperatives, told the Guardian.\n\nNozaki said local fishermen had \u201cwalked through brick walls\u201d to rebuild their industry and confront what they say are harmful rumours about the safety of their seafood. Last year\u2019s catch was just 16% of pre-crisis levels, partly because of the public\u2019s reluctance to eat fish caught off Fukushima.\n\nCurrently, just over one million tonnes of contaminated water is held in almost 1,000 tanks at Fukushima Daiichi, but the utility has warned that it will run out of space by the summer of 2022.\n\nFukushima: Japan will have to dump radioactive water into Pacific, minister says Read more\n\nTepco has struggled to deal with the buildup of groundwater, which becomes contaminated when it mixes with water used to prevent the three damaged reactor cores from melting. Although the utility has drastically reduced the amount of wastewater, about 100 tonnes a day still flows into the reactor buildings.\n\nReleasing it into the sea would also anger South Korea, adding to pressure on diplomatic ties already shaken by a trade dispute linked to the countries\u2019 bitter wartime history.\n\nSeoul, which has yet to lift an import ban on Fukushima seafood introduced in 2013, claimed last week that discharging the water would pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to the marine environment \u2013 a charge rejected by Japan.\n\nFukushima fisheries officials point out that they operate a stringent testing regime that bans the sale of any seafood found to contain more than 50 becquerels of radioactive material per kilogram \u2013 a much lower threshold than the standard of 100 becquerels per kilogram observed in the rest of Japan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Just over one million tonnes of contaminated water is held in almost 1,000 tanks at Fukushima Daiichi.

Shaun Burnie\n\nTepco\u2019s Advanced Liquid Processing System removes highly radioactive substances, such as strontium and caesium, from the water but the technology does not exist to filer out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that coastal nuclear plants commonly dump along with water into the ocean. Tepco admitted last year, however, that the water in its tanks still contained contaminants beside tritium.\n\nSupporters of the discharge option have pointed out that water containing high levels of tritium, which occurs in minute amounts in nature, would not be released until it has been diluted to meet safety standards.\n\nBut Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace Germany who regularly visits Fukushima, said a proportion of radioactive tritium had the potential to deliver a concentrated dose to cell structures in plants, animals or humans. \u201cDilution does not avoid this problem,\u201d he said.\n\nBurnie believes the solution is to continue storing the water, possibly in areas outside the power plant site \u2013 a move that is likely to encounter opposition from nuclear evacuees whose abandoned villages already host millions of cubic metres of radioactive soil.\n\n\u201cThere is no short-term solution to the water problem at Fukushima Daiichi, as groundwater will continue to enter the site and become contaminated,\u201d Burnie said. \u201cA major step would be for the government to start being honest with the Japanese people and admit that the scale of the challenges at the site mean their entire schedule for decommissioning is a fantasy.\u201d\n\n\u2018No other option\u2019\n\nGovernment officials say they won\u2019t make a decision until they have received a report from an expert panel, but there are strong indications that dumping is preferred over other options such a vaporising, burying or storing the water indefinitely.\n\nShinjiro Koizumi, the new environment minister, has not indicated if he shares his predecessor\u2019s belief, voiced last week, that there is \u201cno other option\u201d but to discharge the water into the sea.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency has recommended that Japan release the treated water, while Toyoshi Fuketa, the chairman of Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority, said a decision on its future must be made soon.\n\n\u201cWe are entering a period in which further delays in deciding what measure to implement will no longer be tolerable,\u201d Fuketa said, according to the Asahi Shimbun.\n\nPutting off a decision could delay work to locate and remove melted fuel from the damaged reactors \u2013 a process that is already expected to take four decades.\n\nCritics say the government is reluctant to openly support the dumping option for fear of creating a fresh controversy over Fukushima during the Rugby World Cup, which starts this week, and the buildup to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nNozaki said he and other fishermen throughout Fukushima would continue the fight to keep the water out of the ocean. \u201cReleasing the water would send us back to square one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would mean the past eight years have amounted to nothing.\u201d", "description": "Eight years after the triple disaster, Japan\u2019s local industry faces fresh crisis \u2013 the dumping of radioactive water from the power plant", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27afa8dd85562beafb7be382f266d512dd20179a/0_89_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ddb967aa2c2537f03614357915e23c21", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
