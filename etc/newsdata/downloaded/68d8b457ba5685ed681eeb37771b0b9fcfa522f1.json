(Photo by GEORG HOCHMUTH / APA / AFP)\n\nClimate change activist Greta Thunberg famously doesn\u2019t fly to reduce her carbon footprint, and since she\u2019s currently touring North America on her way to Santiago, Chile on Dec. 2 for the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Summit, she\u2019s in need of some efficient transportation. Enter the Governator.\n\nAs Car and Driver reports, Arnold Schwarzenegger arranged a Tesla for the 16-year-old to use on her journey to various events across the United States and Canada. \u201cGetting his electric Hummer across the country would be quite a challenge, so it isn\u2019t his personal car,\u201d his spokesman told the publication. \u201cIt\u2019s a Tesla Model 3.\u201d\n\nSchwarzenegger is a big fan of electric vehicles. In addition to his electric Hummer, said to be the first of its kind, he also owns an electric Mercedes-Benz G-class. It\u2019s a long way from his early days as the face of the gas-guzzling, big SUV\u2019s of 1990s that the action star and former governor helped popularize. These days, the Terminator star is so pro-electric that he\u2019s even dressing up like a used car salesman to create viral videos to promote more environmentally-friendly options for getting around.\n\nThe spokesman also told Car and Driver that Schwarzenegger told Thunberg to call him if she needed anything. With the Tesla Model 3, \u201cGreta can travel fully electric through the United States and Canada,\u201d he said. The two first met back in May at a climate summit in Austria, Schwarzenegger\u2019s home country; after the meeting, the former governor of California tweeted that he was \u201cstarstruck\u201d in the presence of the teen activist.\n\nExcited to kick off our @R20_AWS in Vienna. I have to admit I was starstruck when I met @gretathunberg. Tune in tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/b0c5FtmZDq \u2014 Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) May 27, 2019\n\nYesterday, Thunberg stopped at the Marine Mammal Interpretation Centre in Tadoussac, Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Car and Driver", "description": "The former governor of California loaned the 16-year-old climate change activist an electric Tesla Model 3 to get around North America.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1146682125.jpg?fit=1024%2C681"}
