Every day, the gun violence epidemic inflicts a devastating toll in communities across America, this time in West Texas. The @SenateGOP must end its obstruction & finally pass House-approved legislation to #EndGunViolence\". The 2A of our Constitution prevents government from infringing on our right to defend ourselves with firearms. The 53-Title U.S. Code is the compilation of all federal laws and regulations governing our country, from which all state's laws are written. Title5 USC, para 706 addresses the requirements of any laws we intended to foist upon our citizens. It is prohibited to pass any law which is Arbitrary or Capricious, meaning that each law must serve a designated purpose and be clearly capable of performing that goal. No gun restrictions have ever been shown to prevent shootings; outlaws are simply not going to obey laws. The law abiding citizens who would obey gun control laws would be left vulnerable to the outlaws who don't, in violation of the unalienable rights to Life Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness guaranteed in our Declaration of Independence. In an overwhelming majority of shootings, the killers were already prohibited by some law from possessing a firearm, and of course from assaulting another human being or committing murder. They simply didn't care ~ they broke the law. Because it costs (a lot of) money to enact new laws, and because we American taxpayers bear the financial burden of that cost, we have the right to ensure no law is arbitrary or capricious. The Dems can scream all they want. Until they can prove gun bans will protect us from criminal gunmen, we will not pass any law which restricts our rights to self defense.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"}
