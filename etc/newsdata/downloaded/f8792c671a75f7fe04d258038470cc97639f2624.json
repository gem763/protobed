They were wondering if he really does think he\u2019s invulnerable, and is just daring his political enemies to go at him, or if he has a strategy here.\n\nIn her column today (paywalled), Peggy Noonan says that Trump\u2019s behavior in the past couple of weeks has compelled the ground to shift somewhat in DC, over impeachment. Excerpts:\n\nHere are three reasons to think the situation is more fluid than we realize.\n\nFirst, the president, confident of acquittal, has chosen this moment to let his inner crazy flourish daily and dramatically\u2014the fights and meltdowns, the insults, the Erdogan letter. Just when the president needs to be enacting a certain stability he enacts its opposite. It is possible he doesn\u2019t appreciate the jeopardy he\u2019s in with impeachment bearing down; it is possible he knows and what behavioral discipline he has is wearing down. The second is that the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, told his caucus this week to be prepared for a trial that will go six days a week and could last six to eight weeks. In September there had been talk the Senate might receive articles of impeachment and execute a quick, brief response\u2014a short trial, or maybe a motion to dismiss. Mr. McConnell told CNBC then that the Senate would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to take up impeachment, but \u201chow long you are on it is a different matter.\u201d Now he sees the need for a major and lengthy undertaking. Part of the reason would be practical: He is blunting attack lines that the Republicans arrogantly refused to give impeachment the time it deserves. But his decision also gives room for the unexpected\u2014big and serious charges that sweep public opinion and change senators\u2019 votes. \u201cThere is a mood change in terms of how much they can tolerate,\u201d said a former high Senate staffer. Senators never know day to day how bad things will get. The third reason is the number of foreign-policy professionals who are not ducking testimony in the House but plan to testify or have already. Suppressed opposition to President Trump among foreign-service officers and others is busting out.\n\nShe goes on to observe that every single day, Trump does something that further erodes his position. But, she says, the needle on impeachment and removal will only move significantly against Trump if 1) the hearings are perceived as fair, and 2) something else emerges that makes people feel \u201calarm\u201d over the conduct of foreign policy and national security policy under Trump. At this point, she says, we aren\u2019t there.\n\nInteresting column. It really is interesting to observe Trump\u2019s natural brinksmanship, even when there is absolutely no upside to it for him. It has made me think this past week that the man really might be dangerously unstable.\n\nI\u2019m about to drive for the rest of the day. I\u2019ll check in with y\u2019all later.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-1.12.24-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
