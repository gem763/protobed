Trump\u2019s visit also attracted additional media outlets who reported live from the field before the game, including Fox News and CNN.\n\nNationals manager Dave Martinez said the team hadn\u2019t talked about Trump\u2019s visit and it wouldn\u2019t be a distraction for them.\n\n\u201cYou know what, he\u2019s coming to the game,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fan. Hopefully he cheers for the Washington Nationals, and I hope he enjoys the game.\u201d\n\nPitcher Stephen Strasburg said that \u201ceverybody is excited\u201d and relayed a funny story about the heightened security.\n\n\u201cUsually the dogs that are sniffing in our clubhouse are these nice Labs that are super friendly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd today there was a German Shepherd that I didn\u2019t really feel comfortable petting.\u201d\n\nLast week, Nationals pitcher An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez said that if Trump wanted to attend a game, \u201ceverybody has to respect that situation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to attack him like I got something against (him),\u201d the Venezuelan native said. \u201cI\u2019m out of this country, but then I respect all those situations. And like I say, he\u2019s the president and if he wants to come, why no?\u201d\n\nHouston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander was asked if he would want to visit the White House if the Astros won the World Series and Trump invited the team. He claimed he was \u201csuperstitious\u201d about answering that question before the team had actually won.\n\nTrump plans to arrive after the game starts and leave before it ends in an effort to limit disruption for the fans in attendance.\n\nWashington-based celebrity chef and humanitarian Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a noted critic of the president, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
