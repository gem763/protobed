But alas, it wasn't meant to be, and despite winning the big award, the only other they scooped was for Peter Dinklage, who won the Supporting Actor award. Not to worry though - the show already won 10 Creative Arts Emmys last week.\n\nOf course, loyal followers were pretty gutted that they'll never have the opportunity to win an Emmy again.\n\nemilia played one of the strongest characters of game of thrones, she deserved that award. #Emmys\n\n\n\n\"we will come again, queen, and the next time we shall come with fire and blood.\" pic.twitter.com/UyLOSckgYY\n\n\n\n\u2014 alan (@alanbibriesca) September 23, 2019\n\nat the end of the day, no award can decide whether someone is an outstanding actress/actor or not. we\u2019re still & always will be proud of you, emilia clarke. thank you for bringing life to one of the most phenomenal characters ever made.#Emmys #GameOfThrones pic.twitter.com/vSkFf6j5Rs \u2014 nightwing\u2019s left ass cheek (@GREEKHEROINES) September 23, 2019\n\nNone of the Game of Thrones women won an award.. that\u2019s so sad, it\u2019s not their fault the script sucked, they killed it.. oh well #Emmys pic.twitter.com/dGbBz0lBBu \u2014 L*v (@nothinmatters13) September 23, 2019\n\nyou\u2019re telling me alfie allen, best male actor in game of thrones, didn\u2019t win a single award for his performance as theon greyjoy?
