In 2016, he was charged with manslaughter for a fatal hit-and-run which killed a Portland teenager. The Saudi Arabian government posted his bond then, US officials say, put him on a private plane days later. He hasn't been seen since\n\n'The American people deserve answers. These are not academic matters, and this is not about a series of victimless crimes.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Wyden pushed the Saudi Fugitivies Declassification Act through the Oregon senate on Thursday\n\n'This is about manslaughter, rape and more. This is about real people, real families, who have suffered immeasurable pain,' U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden said on Thursday in an impassioned speech.\n\nThe bill is called the Saudi Fugitives Declassification Act.\n\nIt would require the FBI to reveal what it knows about the Saudi nationals who have mysteriously left the country after posting bail.\n\nAmong them is Abulrahman Sameer Noorah. He was facing a manslaughter trial for fatally running over Fallon Smart, a Portland teenager, in 2016.\n\nNoorah had his $100,000 bond posted for him by the Saudi government.\n\nHis lawyer was also paid for by the government, and US officials say he was likely taken out of the country on a private plane that was again, paid for by his government.\n\nAs a matter of policy, the Saudi Arabian embassy says it pays the bail of any of its citizens - so long as they ask - in the US.\n\nAlong with Noorah, dozens of other students have been mysteriously spirited out of the country.\n\nAbulrahman Sameer Noorah\n\nSuliman Ali Algwaiz\n\nAbulrahman Sameer Noorah - Fatal hit and run of Portland teenager\n\nNoorah's case sparked outrage in 2016.\n\nHe vanished just two weeks before he was due to stand trial on manslaughter charges for killing 15-year-old Fallon Smart with his car when she was crossing a road in Portland in August 2016.\n\nNoorah had been released from jail at the time on a $100,000 bond that the Saudi consulate paid.\n\nHe vanished after being picked up from his college campus in a black SUV.\n\nSuliman Ali Algwaiz - Drunken hit and run of a homeless person\n\nPortland State University student Suliman Ali Algwaiz was arrested in August 2016 after he drunkenly struck a homeless man with his car.\n\nThe victim suffered a litany of injuries to his head and body.\n\nAlgwaiz fled the scene but was later sentenced to 90 days in jail.\n\nAlgwaiz was serving his sentence at weekends, but vanished before completing the 90 days and a warrant for his arrest is still outstanding.\n\nWaleed Ali Alharthi\n\nWaleed Ali Alharthi - Child porn\n\nAlharthi who was an Oregon State University student, was found in possession of child porn in April 2015.\n\nPolice found pornographic videos on his laptop involving children.

The consulate also put up the security deposit for his $500,000 bail.\n\nAlharthi attended multiple court hearings related to his case but failed to attend a status check in April 2015.\n\nHis lawyer told the court that she feared he was dead but authorities learned he had flown from Mexico City to Paris the week before.\n\nAbdulaziz Al Duways\n\nAbdulaziz Al Duways - Rape\n\nDuways was arrested in December 2014 over the rape of a female classmate at Western Oregon University.\n\nArrest affidavits related to his case show that the alleged victim accused Al Duways of giving her marijuana and whiskey shots prior to the attack.\n\nShe called 911 during the alleged attack and when police arrived they found her crying in his bed.\n\nAl Duways had allegedly told her: 'Tell them I'm your girlfriend' and 'I'll give you anything. I'll do anything if you don't tell them'.\n\nHe was charged with rape and held on a $500,000 bond. Days later, a Saudi consulate official paid his bond and Al Duways vanished before he faced court.\n\nIn 2012, Oregon State University student Ali Hussain Alhamoud was charged with raping a young woman.\n\nHe was released on bail, which the Saudi government posted, and he flew back to Saudi Arabia that same day.\n\nMohammed Zuraibi Al-Zoabi\n\nMohammed Zuraibi Al-Zoabi - Sexual Assault\n\nAl-Zoabi disappeared in December 2018 from Nova Scotia, Canada, after being charged with sexual assault, assault and forcible confinement of a woman between 2015-17.\n\nSaud Alabdullatif - Rape and kidnap\n\nof Spokane County, Washington, disappeared in May 2016.
