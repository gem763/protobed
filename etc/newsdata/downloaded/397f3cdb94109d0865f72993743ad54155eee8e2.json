The sides have been meeting daily.\n\nOne key issue is around assembly of future vehicles. The UAW wants GM to make commitments on future products it would build in various plants beyond what has currently been offered, said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified.\n\nGM officials previously said the Detroit company\u2019s labor rates are the highest in the industry and it needs the ability to build some vehicles in other markets to keep costs down.\n\nJust before the strike began, GM, the largest U.S. automaker by vehicle sales, said that its offer to the UAW included plans to invest more than $7 billion in its U.S. plants over the life of the deal.\n\nGM also said then it had \u201csolutions\u201d for the Lordstown, Ohio, and Detroit assembly plants that it had previously said would cease making vehicles. Sources said at the time those plans included a battery plant in Ohio and building an electric truck in Detroit.\n\nThe UAW has previously said it wants GM to shift vehicle assembly work back from other countries like Mexico and China. The source said that remains an issue in the talks.\n\nThrough August, 526,000 of the 573,000 vehicles GM exported from Mexico were sent to the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump and many Democrats have urged GM to shift production to unused or underused U.S. plants.\n\nOther issues remaining in the talks include wages and pensions, the source previously said.\n\nAnalysts estimate the strike has cost GM over $1 billion, while LMC Automotive estimated on Thursday that GM has lost production of 118,000 vehicles through Oct. 2.", "description": "The United Auto Workers rejected General Motor's latest offer for a new four-year labor contract, according to a union official.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9a370921000025043258c2.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
