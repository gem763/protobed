(AP) - Beer will begin being sold inside a Mississippi college\u2019s football stadium at a game this weekend.\n\nThe Oxford Eagle reports the first shipment of beer was delivered to Ole Miss\u2019 Vaught-Hemingway stadium on Thursday. The match against Texas A&M; on Saturday marks the first time in recent years the stadium will be permitted to sell alcohol to fans.\n\nSEC chancellors and school presidents voted in May to allow league members the option of selling beer and wine during sporting events.\n\nOle Miss officials have said they waited until the second half of the season so they could learn from other schools\u2019 experiences and promote responsible behavior.\n\nTwo beers will be allowed for purchase at any one time by legal customers. Sales will end at the conclusion of the third quarter.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Oxford Eagle, http://www.oxfordeagle.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Beer will begin being sold inside a Mississippi college's football stadium at a game this weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
