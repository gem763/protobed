It should be warm, soft and relaxing if we want to achieve a proper wind-down that ensures a good night\u2019s kip.\n\nChoosing the right bedside lamp for our nightstands, then, is of utmost importance \u2013 not only for our interiors schemes, but for our general wellbeing, too.\n\nLighting design is boundlessly innovative, bringing form and function together with the most dazzling results \u2013 and there\u2019s a wealth of creative styles to choose from in a bedside lamp.\n\nTraditional designs that feature a heavy ceramic base with a fabric shade feature in our top ten alongside the wholly contemporary and sculptural.\n\nBeyond the obvious aesthetic appeal, you\u2019ll need to think about the lamp\u2019s shape and size, allowing it to sit pretty on your bedside table without overwhelming the space.\n\nSome table lamps are seriously sizable \u2013 great for a loud statement piece in the hallway, not so much in the quiet sanctuary of the bedroom, so if space is an issue, look for styles that specify bedside, and get your tape measure out before you commit.\n\nInvest in a good quality, frosted bulb for your bedside lamp and you\u2019ll be rewarded with an ambient glow so inviting you\u2019ll want to dive straight into bed. There\u2019s no need to go over 40 watts here \u2013 choosing soft mood lighting over brightness is key. And with the naked bulb trend seeing no sign of dimming, some bedside lamps demand a decorative bulb with a visible filament to give you the full effect.\n\nWe tested these bedside lamps on our nightstand, looking for design and functionality, quality and affordability, and more than a little bit of wow-factor. Because when it comes to illumination, the very best products should spark awe.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

Its unconventional design \u2013 a brass plated steel goblet supporting a gold hued glass shade \u2013 is both retro and warm. Heavy duty and gleaming before we\u2019d even switched it on, it certainly made its presence felt on our nightstand. An ideal bedside light, it offered a golden glow that turned our bedroom into a cosy sanctuary, yet, with its slender tripod legs, left us enough space on the bedside table for our morning coffee. Team it with a large, globular E27 bulb for the best results.\n\nBuy now\n\nBHS Beryl LED table lamp, brass: \u00a350, BHS\n\nHigh street casualty British Home Stores was always about the lighting \u2013 an interior designer\u2019s secret weapon, in fact, offering an enviable selection of pendants, chandeliers, floor lights and table lamps, all design-led and deceptively affordable. Like a phoenix from the flames, it's reinvented itself as an online only venture focusing almost entirely on lighting. The tall and elegant Beryl, with its trombone-like hooped brass structure, and frosted glass LED lights that offer a soft glow, was a class act on our bedside table. Deco-fabulous.\n\nBuy now\n\nPooky smaller artur table lamp: \u00a3160, Pooky\n\nA maximalist\u2019s dream, this artichoke shaped lamp is crackle glazed in arresting turquoise while its block printed, pleated shade is opulent in its disregard for economy of fabric.

The ceramic base is glazed in dreamy sea blues and is etched with a geometric pattern that\u2019s difficult not to run your fingers over. Its muted mustard shade offers an eye-catching contrast. On the larger side, we found this lamp works best on a mid-century mahogany headboard with low, integrated bedside tables.\n\nBuy now\n\nHouseof pill table lamp in brass: \u00a340, Houseof\n\nIf space saving is an objective when choosing a bedside lamp, this delicate and diminutive number from the newly launched Houseof could be the one.

LED bulbs are included and offer a warming glow (even in blue).\n\nBuy now\n\nGingko R space lamp, walnut: \u00a369.95, Prezzybox\n\nWhether it\u2019s for rest, relaxation, reading \u2013 or all three, the R space lamp marries innovative design with clever tech to provide a great little bedside lamp. It arrived in an inconspicuous slender box (top marks for minimal packaging), and unfolds, book-like, from a wooden R into a pretty lantern-inspired lamp supported by an attractive walnut frame. A versatile bedside lamp, we loved that we could plug it in and charge it up with its in-built rechargeable battery, while a nifty remote control allowed us to dim the light.\n\nBuy now\n\nRockett St George modern gold accent table lamp, dusky pink: \u00a3120, Rockett St George\n\nWith design roots in a classic desk lamp, Rockett St George\u2019s offering is as practical as it is pretty.
