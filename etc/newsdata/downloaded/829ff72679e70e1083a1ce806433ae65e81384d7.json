To complement this, my skin is dry and lacklustre, with fine lines and an overall drained appearance.\n\nThe best solution would be a week-long stay in a five star Maldivian spa. Obviously - I have three children and work full time - so this isn\u2019t even a glow on the distant horizon.\n\nIn my job, I regularly get to test out exciting new beauty products, and when, after a particularly pamper-free week, I\u2019m offered a lifeline in the form of the L'Or\u00e9al Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Ampoules, I leap at the chance!\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Beauty writer Alice Smellie tested the new 7-day skin SOS routine - L'Or\u00e9al Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Ampoules - and saw surprising results to her complexion in just a week (pictured above, left) on day one and again on day seven (above, right)\n\nThe 7-day supply of ampoules are perfect for replumping your skin before a big event, turning back the clock on dehydrated skin or to just give you a boost\n\nHowever, I will admit, I did doubt that they would make much difference to my current complexion crisis.\n\nWhat is hyaluronic acid? It sounds scary, but hyaluronic acid is actually something that is naturally produced by our skin to help maintain its moisture levels. Despite its name, it's actually more of a gel-like molecule that can retain 1,000-times its weight in water. Because of this, it\u2019s good for your skin for a number of reasons: - It helps your skin look plumper, younger and healthier. - It helps reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. - It can help shield your skin against environmental pollutants.\n\nThere is excellent science behind these recyclable one-a-day ampoules, which come in packs of seven and can be used as a monthly boost, on-the-go when travelling, or - as here - a skin SOS rescue system.\n\nEach sterile little container is packed with highly concentrated Hyaluronic Acid - a gold standard ingredient beloved by experts and beauty fans alike.\n\nHyaluronic Acid is naturally present in the body, and is super useful for moisturising, as it can hold 1000 times its weight in water. Here, it\u2019s sealed in tiny (but life-saving) amounts to preserve the benefits and freshness of the formula.\n\nIn addition, the L'Or\u00e9al scientists have cannily used two sizes of molecule, so that the Hyaluronic Acid can work on different layers of skin; the larger one sits on the surface to draw in and preserve moisture, and the smaller molecule penetrates the epidermis to work on wrinkles.\n\nAlice took photos across the week at 10pm each night, with no make-up apart from a slick of lipgloss and mascara. Pictured (above left) on day two and (above right) on day three\n\nDespite having a winter bug during her trial, Alice saw instant benefits of plumper looking skin - pictured (above left) on day four and (above right) on day five\n\n\u2018Enriched with soothing Vitamin B5 and free of alcohol, colourant and fragrance, this formula is ideal for even sensitive skin,\u2019 points out L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 Global Scientific Communications Director, Elisabeth Bouhadana.\n\nI incorporate the ampoules into my nightly routine; first cleansing my skin and then flicking the cap off a single ampoule so the product falls into the body. Then I snap off the cap and tip the light, smooth and surprisingly liquid product into my hand, so it can be carefully patted around my face.\n\nMy dry skin positively drinks it in, as though I\u2019ve spent the last six months living in a desert.\n\nTo track progress, I dutifully photograph the results every evening at around 10pm, taking a staggeringly unflattering picture of my skin close-up and make-up free (except for a slick of lip gloss and a dash of mascara!). And while my camera might not do the differences in my complexion justice - I can certainly feel the difference!\n\nResult! Alice felt her skin looked much more radiant and younger after her week trial - and was thrilled with how the immediate the results were\n\nDoes it make an instant difference? Well, amazingly, yes. The light gel sinks in rapidly and my skin looks more supple and feels smoother. My ghastly drawn look is somewhat alleviated, and the next morning I don\u2019t look as tired as usual.\n\nWhat is an ampoule? *What is it? An ampoule is basically a little glass or plastic container used to hold powerful concentrations of ingredients that have been popular in Korean skincare routines for years. The ampoules are hermetically sealed, allowing the formula to only come into contact with air once it is opened, without any additives, fragrance or alcohol. * When do I use it? Because of its high concentration, ampoules act like a booster or a shot to achieve an intense result in a short period of time. They are best used when your skin is in need of a boost, feeling dull and lacklustre or leading up to an important event. * How do I use it? Ampoules should be used after cleansing and before your daily moisturising regime. You should use 1 every day for 7 days.. * Why is it essential to my regime? The ingredients in ampoules are highly concentrated and give your skin the boost it needs.\n\nI diligently apply the product every day. In addition to a stressful week, I also develop an early winter bug. My photographs don\u2019t all show me looking my best, but I can assure you, I ought to be looking far worse! I feel quite rubbish, but my skin is luminous.\n\nBy day five, I can clearly see more smoothness, and my whole face looks a little plumped up. I\u2019m impressed on Day 1 and even more so on Day 7.\n\nI read online reviews of the product to see whether others concur with my experience.\n\nThese are mostly, as you\u2019d expect, as glowing as the skin of the reviewers.\n\nAnd talking of glowing reviews, even my children mentioned I didn't appear quite so lacklustre - saying I looked like I'd \"had a good sleep\" - which surely is one of the greatest compliments a mother can get?\n\nAfter a week, I am forced to concede that my skin does look as though it has been on holiday. I feel that my cheeks have particularly benefited, and the lines under my eyes are less evident.\n\nBut as for the rest of me - well, I\u2019m still yearning for that elusive week in the tropics.\n\nThe ampoules are the latest addition to the L\u2019Oreal Paris Revitalift Filler Range with Hyaluronic Acid\n\nIncorporate the 7-day SOS system into your regime today by ordering your L'Or\u00e9al Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Ampoules HERE or from your local Boots store...", "description": "My face is as hollow as that of the digitally enhanced Angelina Jolie in the new Maleficent movie.
