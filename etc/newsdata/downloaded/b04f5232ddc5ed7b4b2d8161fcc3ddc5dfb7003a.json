REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s Bayer (BAYGn.DE) said on Wednesday that the number of U.S. plaintiffs blaming its glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer mushroomed to 42,700 from 18,400 in July, raising the stakes in the group\u2019s efforts to reach a settlement.\n\n\u201cThis significant increase is clearly driven by the plaintiff-side television advertising spend which is estimated to have roughly doubled in the third quarter compared with the entire first half of the year,\u201d Bayer, which last year acquired Monsanto for $63 billion, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, the number of lawsuits says nothing about their merits,\u201d it added.\n\nThe company said it continued to be constructively engaged in a mediation process ordered by a federal judge in California.\n\nBayer is widely expected to eventually settle to buy itself out of the litigation wave, with analysts estimates on the future size of a settlement in a $8-$12 billion range.\n\nIts shares have lost about 30% of their value since last August when a California jury in the first such lawsuit found Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks associated with its glyphosate-based weedkillers such as Roundup.\n\nBayer, which says regulators and extensive research have found glyphosate to be safe, is banking on U.S. appeals courts to reverse or tone down the first three court rulings that have so far awarded tens of millions of dollars to each plaintiff.\n\nThird-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the group rose 7.5% to 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion), in line with market expectations. They were helped by higher sales of crop protection chemicals, seeds and consumer healthcare products.", "description": "Germany's Bayer said on Wednesday that the number of U.S. plaintiffs blaming its glyphosate-based weedkillers for their cancer mushroomed to 42,700 from 18,400 in July, raising the stakes in the group's efforts to reach a settlement.", "authors": ["Ludwig Burger", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446446048&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0C9", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
