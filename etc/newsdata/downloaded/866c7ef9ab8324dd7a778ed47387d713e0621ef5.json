is not the French aristocrat suspecting of murdering his family eight years ago.\n\nThe twist comes as officers thought they had finally tracked down fugitive Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s.\n\nA \u2018partial\u2019 fingerprint sample led to speculation that the case that has transfixed France might finally be solved.\n\nBut a DNA test proved it is not the 58-year-old, who vanished after his family were shot dead in April 2011.\n\nXavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s was last seen in April 2011 (Picture: AFP)\n\nDe Ligonnes went on the run after the bodies of Agnes, 49, and children Tomas, 21, Arthur, 18, Anne, 16, and Benoit, 13, were found buried in the garden of the family house in Nantes, western France.\n\nAlongside them were their two pet Labradors, Jules and L\u00e9on.\n\nThere has been speculation about what happened to the aristocrat with several believing he has since died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, a number of unconfirmed sightings mean that the prosecution has never closed the case.\n\nFrench police are said to have picked out the suspect at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris on Friday afternoon.\n\nBut there was not enough time to seize him and so they alerted British police who made an arrest when the suspect\u2019s Easyjet flight landed in Glasgow.\n\nPeople hold the coffin of a member of the Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s family during the

police source said: \u2018DNA checks have shown that the man arrested in Glasgow is not Xavier Dupont de Ligonnes.\u2019\n\nPolice in Scotland have not released any details of the man they did arrest.\n\nThe De Ligonn\u00e8s family (from top L) Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s, his wife Agnes, and children Thomas, Arthur, Anne and Benoit (Picture: AFP)\n\nFor years France has been gripped by the question of how De Ligonnes had disappeared without trace, with some suggesting he may have killed himself.\n\nHundreds of reported sightings only added to the mystery.\n\nLast year police searched underground caves and an abandoned potassium mine in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, in the south of France following a tip-off.\n\nDe Ligonnes was last officially seen on a CCTV camera in April 2011 walking in the countryside in the south of France.\n\nIn the months before, he had inherited a .22 rifle from his father and receipts found at the home revealed he had bought a silencer, a spade and other equipment that could have been used in the murders.\n\nThe bodies of De Ligonn\u00e8s wife, four children and family pets were found in the back garden (Picture: AFP)\n\nFrench prosecutors said he killed all five of his victims in a \u2018methodical execution,\u2019 shooting them each twice in the head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is believed to have covered them in quicklime and wrapped them in sheets before burying them under concrete.\n\nDe Ligonnes, who ran a number of internet businesses, was said to be having financial problems and a mistress in Paris was among those asking for money.\n\nHe disappeared telling friends he was a US secret agent who was being taken into witness protection.\n\nNeighbours reported to the police that they had not seen any of the family for more than three weeks.\n\nThe murders transfixed France (Picture: AP)\n\nDetectives who visited initially found a severed leg under the garden terrace, and then uncovered the bodies of those who had been killed.\n\nProsecutors never ruled out the possibility that he was living rough or being sheltered by friends or members of his extended family, who own country homes around France.\n\nThe family say he is innocent of the murders and were being kept informed of the arrest in Scotland.\n\nA picture showing Benoit Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s, one of the five family members murdered at their home in Nantes (Picture: AFP)\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s originally came from Versailles, home of the pre-Revolutionary kings and queens of France, and was technically a count who could trace his lineage back generations.\n\nIn confiscated emails he said that he considered himself to be part of a Roman Catholic elite which was superior to \u2018the masses\u2019.\n\n\u2018I think I\u2019ve got a superiority complex, you could call it that,\u2019 he wrote.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s based on a simple observation: I belong to a group of people who are intelligent, determined, balanced and in good moral and physical health.\n\n\u2018Such people are rare compared to the masses.\u2019", "description": "A man arrested at Glasgow Airport is not the
