While that\u2019s a welcome effort to avoid another government shutdown, this plan falls short of the much-needed resources to secure America\u2019s border. The deal also continues along a track of spending too much money while growing the size of the government.\n\n\u201cFor years, The Heritage Foundation has outlined the threats posed from a porous border and called on Congress to make border security a top priority. Now is the time to take action.
