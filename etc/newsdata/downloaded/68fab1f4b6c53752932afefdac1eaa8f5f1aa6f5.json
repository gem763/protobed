Hanyang University School of Law professor Park Chan-un wrote on Facebook that the investigation on Justice Minister Cho was an abuse of prosecutors\u2019 investigative power to kill a certain person. He expressed his anger on selective justice. Last month, a poster was put up at Seoul National University, claiming that selective justice is advocated, ignoring greater social contradiction. It opposed the protesters\u2019 calls for Cho to step down.\n\n\n\nBeing furious at the prosecution\u2019s investigation of Cho is linked to the rhetoric of the democratization activists in the 1980s. They argued that trivial internal wrongdoings could be condoned in order to stand against the greater evil of military dictatorships. The group sentiment based on the dichotomy of good versus evil was strong. When it added up to serious gender discrimination and personal infringement, they had to keep quiet before the violent justification of \u201cgreater justice.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat about the following case? The photo and identity of the female prosecutor involved in the raid of Cho\u2019s residence were disclosed. Some online comments disparaged her appearance as \u201cshe looks anti-government\u201d or \u201ca cake fallen from the rooftop.\u201d It was obviously misogynistic.\n\n\n\nBut women\u2019s groups, including the National Women\u2019s Solidarity, remained silent. They had sensitively responded to misogyny issues, including when the opposition Liberty Korea Party\u2019s floor leader Na Kyung-won called President Moon Jae-in\u2019s supporters \u201cprostitutes.\u201d But this time, those liberal women\u2019s groups kept mum even when their members committed cyber terrorism on the female prosecutor who searched Justice Minister Cho\u2019s residence. Isn\u2019t this selective justice?\n\n\n\nU.S. political philosopher John Rowls wrote in \u201cA Theory of Justice\u201d that the theory of fairness was the first principle. Those who advocate justice while neglecting universality may be the most unjust villains.\n\n\n\nJoongAng Ilbo, Oct. 10, Page 31", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
