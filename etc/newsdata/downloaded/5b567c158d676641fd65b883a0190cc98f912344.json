(Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe NBA has come under severe criticism for bending over backward to appease the Chinese government after Beijing threatened the league with severe economic consequences over one pro-Hong Kong tweet. But we must remember, the NBA and its teams are just the latest victims of the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to force U.S. companies to do its political bidding. The U.S. government must help U.S. companies resist becoming complicit in Beijing\u2019s repression.\n\nIt started when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey posted a (now-deleted) tweet with an image that said \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d Within hours, The Chinese Basketball Association, sportswear brand Li-Ning, SPD Bank, state broadcaster CCTV\u2019s sports, and tech-giant Tencent all announced they would suspend business with the Rockets. We know the Chinese government organized this swift punishment because so many Chinese entities shunned the team so quickly; in China that only happens with official approval.\n\nMorey, under pressure, issued a partial apology, saying, \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.\u201d\n\nThe NBA issued a measured statement in English calling Morey\u2019s views \u201cregrettable,\u201d and a more apologetic statement in Chinese, saying, \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey.\u201d\n\nBeijing is costing the Rockets millions while pressing them to apologize \u2014 and implicitly threatening every other NBA team. The punishment came before the trial. That\u2019s how coercion works. It\u2019s how the Chinese Communist Party operates.\n\nBut the Chinese government\u2019s massive, punitive and coercive reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet must not be allowed, because the CCP is using its government power to bully Americans and American organizations to shut up about its repression. The fact that the NBA is playing along just shows how powerful Beijing has become in getting U.S. institutions to do its political bidding.\n\nLawmakers and Democratic presidential candidates have quickly and rightly criticized the NBA today for folding on human rights in pursuit of cash in China. But it\u2019s not the NBA\u2019s job to stand up to the Chinese government; that\u2019s a job for the U.S. government.\n\nThe U.S. government must first explain to the American people that this is not an isolated incident; Beijing has been exporting its political censorship abroad as part of its comprehensive effort to interfere in free societies. Last year, China severely punished Marriott after an employee in Omaha, Neb., \u201cliked\u201d a pro-Tibet tweet. Marriott profusely apologized and fired the employee.\n\nNext, Chinese authorities demanded all international airlines literally wipe \u201cTaiwan\u201d off their maps, under threat of economic punishment, in what the White House called an instance of \u201cOrwellian nonsense.\u201d In this case, the U.S. carriers resisted and Beijing partially backed down.\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta tried to claim on Twitter that his team is \u201cnot a political organization.\u201d As the New York Times noted, the NBA supported Enes Kanter\u2019s right to speak out about the abuses of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cThe NBA stands with me for freedom and democracy. It\u2019s made all the difference,\u201d Kanter tweeted Sunday.\n\nBut unlike the Turkish government, the Chinese government can hold billions of dollars in business over the NBA\u2019s head. LeBron James and the Lakers are set to play the Brooklyn Nets in Pudong and Shenzhen this week.If the Rockets, the most popular NBA team in China, can be banned over a tweet, there\u2019s no mystery why the rest of the league is running scared.\n\nIn Tokyo on Monday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver tried to argue the league can cave to Chinese pressure and defend free speech. The problem is that you can\u2019t do both at the same time. Silver can\u2019t stand up for Morey and also defend Nets owner Joe Tsai, who posted on Facebook what can only be described as a CCP-like propaganda screed. Tsai, who is also co-founder and executive vice-chairman of Alibaba Group, wrote in support of the Chinese government\u2019s drastic and Orwellian overreaction to Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nTsai\u2019s Facebook message had all the markings of a Chinese government statement. He purported to speak for \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of Chinese citizens, who were supposedly offended by Morey\u2019s tweet. Never mind that Twitter is banned in China and Chinese citizens aren\u2019t allowed to publicly disagree with their government regarding Hong Kong.\n\nTsai also parroted a CCP line by calling Hong Kong protesters a \u201cseparatist movement\u201d and said Hong Kong was a \u201cthird rail\u201d issue, suggesting Americans are no longer allowed to comment on in public. His shameful attempt to snuff out criticism of Beijing is allowed in our free society, as is my criticism of it. That\u2019s what free speech is.\n\nJust last week, China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi said, \u201cChina will not interfere in the internal affairs of the U.S.\u201d This is Chinese interference in our affairs. If we don\u2019t stand up to it now, we will soon find ourselves living in an America where everyone self-censors and nobody is allowed to speak out on things that are obviously outrageous, like Chinese repression in Hong Kong.\n\nBut U.S. companies are not strong enough to resist Chinese government coercion on their own. The U.S. government needs to do much more to make sure U.S. companies don\u2019t have to abandon their values at the point of an economic gun.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: China\u2019s repressive reach is growing\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: The colossal digital police state in China grows even larger\n\nMegan McArdle: If you question whether many Chinese people want democracy, look at Hong Kong\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: China is getting better at repressing its citizens.
