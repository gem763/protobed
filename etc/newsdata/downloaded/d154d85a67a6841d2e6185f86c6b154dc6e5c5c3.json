This makes it more difficult to address critical issues that need to be addressed.\"\n\nEspecially sensitive is the issue of Hong Kong, where tensions between authorities and protesters have escalated over weeks of at times violent demonstrations pushing for greater democracy for the city. Ahead of her visit, Hong Kong activists on Wednesday appealed directly to Merkel to \"express concern\" over the situation and to \"convey our demands to the Chinese government.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the biggest danger to a united European position on China will be how Berlin is going to position itself now\" \u2014 Mikko Huotari, deputy director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies\n\nBut observers say Merkel could opt for a soft approach to Beijing given the larger economic context.\n\n\"Perhaps the biggest danger to a united European position on China will be how Berlin is going to position itself now,\" said Mikko Huotari, deputy director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies. \"There's clear pressure from big companies not to alienate China too far and instead say: 'Let's get back to business.'\"\n\nAlicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think tank, also warned of a threat to the joint EU approach. \"I hope Europe won\u2018t lower its expectations [on Chinese reforms] because of bilateral negotiations between China and Germany,\" she said during a panel debate in Brussels on Wednesday.\n\nA similar warning came from Paris: \"What Europe needs is a strong, coherent, collective approach to China, and what we\u2019re getting in reality is more of a piecemeal approach at the European level with each member state pursuing its own interests at the bilateral level,\" said John Seaman, a research fellow at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).\n\nBefore heading to China, one senior government official conceded that Berlin and Beijing enjoy a \u201ccomplex bilateral relationship,\" part of an ongoing discussion on market access and trade.\n\nDas Auto in the driver's seat\n\nGerman automakers have a lot to lose in China, where producers such as Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler churn out millions of vehicles a year.\n\nSince 2010, German automotive companies have expanded their production base from eight factories in China to 30, looking to capitalize on the world\u2019s largest car market. Sales for the country\u2019s producers have ballooned from 2 million units in 2010 to 5.2 million in 2018, around a fifth of the overall Chinese market, according to figures compiled by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA).\n\nUnderscoring the importance of Merkel\u2019s trip for German industry, demand for seats on the government jet leaving Berlin on Thursday was over-booked. Those onboard will include senior managers from everything from car firms to energy companies and financiers, a government official said.\n\nA significant portion of German car sales in China are satisfied by in-country production: Just 290,000 passenger cars were actually exported from Germany to China last year. But some 150,000 cars were shipped from German auto plants in the U.S. to China, leaving Germany vulnerable to the escalating Sino-American trade conflict.\n\nAfter years of increases, sales in China recorded a modest fall last year \u2014 and that's not just because of the \"enormous transformation process\" toward electric cars and autonomous driving, a VDA official said.\n\n\u201cThe main point is the trade policy. The weak point of the Chinese market is not that they don\u2019t want to buy cars. It\u2019s over the trade struggle with the U.S.,\u201d the official said.\n\nGerman officials say Merkel indeed plans to promote the investment protection agreement while in China.\n\nMerkel urged U.S. President Donald Trump during last month's G7 summit to try to reach a trade truce with Beijing, and she\u2019s expected to do the same over dinner with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping on Friday.\n\nSeaman from the French IFRI think tank said the push for a European investment agreement with Beijing could help Merkel's de-escalation push. The EU is hoping to get China to commit to market openings and granting EU investors guarantees that they won\u2019t be treated worse than Chinese companies.\n\n\"If Europe were able to obtain concessions from China on many of the issues that have irked both Europeans and Americans, it could offer a face-saving way for China to move forward with reforms without appearing to give in to pressure from Washington,\u201d Seaman said.\n\nGerman officials say Merkel indeed plans to promote the investment protection agreement while in China. Negotiations for this deal have advanced slowly in recent years because of Beijing's reluctance to open its market to foreign investors, and another round of talks is set for later this month.\n\n\u201cAn agreement with reciprocity, that\u2019s a word that\u2019s important,\u201d another senior German government official said. \u201cThe same chance and same conditions.\u201d\n\nAt the last EU-China summit in April, both sides agreed to make \"decisive progress\" this year, and officials said Merkel aims to finalize the agreement \u2014 which would also be a boon for German companies \u2014 in the second half of 2020, when she plans to host a China summit with other EU leaders when Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU.\n\n\"Now is the time to tell China: 'Especially in times of a weakening economy in Germany, you have to open up more and create new opportunities and markets for European companies,'\" said J\u00f6rg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce.\n\nTrains and telecoms\n\nMerkel\u2019s visit also comes amid debate over a push to create European champions that can battle state-backed heavyweights in global markets, especially those from China. Over the past year, Berlin has gradually swung behind the push, led by French President Emmanuel Macron, to reform EU competition rules to allow for such giants.\n\nThat debate was reinvigorated recently when China\u2019s CRRC, a state-owned behemoth that is already the world\u2019s largest train maker, announced it would buy a locomotive factory in Kiel, northern Germany, from Vossloh. Critics say the acquisition is a prime example of how China is moving into Europe's industrial backyard, just months after a Siemens-Alstom merger to create a European rail giant was scotched by EU competition authorities.\n\nFrench Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire reacted furiously to the Vossloh takeover, saying that Europe \"must come together to push back against the Chinese giants.\"\n\nAnother issue high up on the agenda will be the rollout of 5G licenses.\n\nBut while Germany has criticized Beijing's market-distorting subsidy programs, and the growing influence of state-owned enterprises, it has also expressed interest in China\u2019s plans like the \u201cMade in China 2025\" strategy and \"One Belt, One Road\" infrastructure plan. That soft-pedaling approach was on full display during Economy Minister Peter Altmaier's visit to China over the summer.\n\nMerkel's trip will include a visit to Wuhan, a provincial city twinned with Duisburg, a strategic terminus for Chinese freight trains running to Europe under the One Belt initiative.\n\nAnother issue high up on the agenda will be the rollout of 5G licenses. After Germany crossed swords with China in July when the Asian country largely gave preference to its own companies in tenders for next-generation telecoms networks in 40 leading Chinese cities, it's now the Chinese who are pushing Berlin to allow Huawei to participate in the German 5G network.\n\nMerkel is expected to make a decision on the sensitive issue in the coming weeks, but the chancellor's office has already signaled that Berlin won\u2019t just automatically follow the U.S. line and ban Huawei due to alleged security risks.\n\n\"If Huawei wants to be internationally successful, it must gain a foothold in Europe, and approval for the German market plays an important role,\" said CDU lawmaker Hauptmann, who is also a member of the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee.\n\nHe urged Merkel to remain tough on Huawei if it was necessary for security reasons. \"If there are serious reservations about granting licenses to Huawei, the chancellor must issue a ban, despite strong pressure or possible countermeasures from Beijing.\"\n\nJakob Hanke and Laurens Cerulus contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
