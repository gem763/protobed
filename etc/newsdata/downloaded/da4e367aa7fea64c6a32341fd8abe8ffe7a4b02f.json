Scientists say that the fossils of ancient arthropods discovered in linear formation in Morocco may indicate a 'collective behaviour'\n\nHe said modern arthropods provide numerous examples, such as the migratory chains of caterpillars, ants or spiny lobsters.\n\nBut the origins and early history of collective behaviour has remained largely unknown.\n\nDr Vannier and his colleagues described several linear clusters of Ampyx priscus, a trilobite arthropod from the lower Ordovician period, in modern day Morocco.\n\nHe said: 'The trilobites, which were between 16 and 22 millimetres long, had a stout spine at the front of their bodies and a pair of very long spines at the back.'\n\nHe said that In each cluster of trilobite fossils examined by his team, individuals were arranged in a line, with the front of their bodies facing in the same direction, maintaining contact via their spines.\n\nThe research team suggest that, given the scale of the patterns seen, the consistent linearity and directionality is unlikely to be the result of passive transportation or accumulation by currents.\n\nThe group is believed to have been fossilised in this linear fashion after dying while travelling and touching spines with each other to form a line\n\nDr Vannier, of Lyon University in France, said: 'Instead, it is more likely that Ampyx was killed suddenly while travelling, for example by being buried rapidly by sediment during a storm.'\n\nThe researchers suggest that Ampyx probably migrated in groups and used their long projecting spines to maintain a single-row formation by physical contact, as they moved along the seafloor.\n\nDr Vannier said: 'This may have been a stress response to disturbance of their environment by storms, detected by motion and touch sensors, which motivated Ampyx to migrate to quieter and deeper waters.\n\n'A comparable behaviour is seen in present-day spiny lobsters.\n\n'Alternatively, the pattern may have been the result of a seasonal reproductive behaviour involving the migration of sexually mature individuals to spawning grounds.'\n\nKnowing that Ampyx was blind, the researchers believe that the trilobites may have coordinated using sensory stimulation via spines and chemicals.\n\nDr Vannier added: 'The discovery shows that a 480-million-year-old arthropod may have used its neural complexity to develop a temporary collective behaviour.'", "description": "Scientists say fossils discovered in linear formation in Morocco may indicate a 'collective behaviour' in response to environmental cues or as part of seasonal reproductive migration.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/19840036-0-image-a-15_1571320271799.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
