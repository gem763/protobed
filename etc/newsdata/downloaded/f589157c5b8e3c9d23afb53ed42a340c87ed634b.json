'Like I can't do something else. And I couldn't look myself in the mirror if I went and did something easy.'\n\nComey tells the New York Times that he's 'not that important in the great sweep of American history' but believes his time as FBI director serves valuable to the anti-Trump movement.\n\n'I have a fantasy about on January 21, 2021, deleting my Twitter and moving on to something else,' he said, referring to the day after the next presidential inauguration. 'But until then, I can't.'\n\nThough Comey has vowed never to run for president himself, he said he's open to publicly supporting Democrats in campaigns for 2020.\n\nEarlier this year he donated money to Senator Amy Klobuchar's campaign and in the past has complimented South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg for his thoughtfulness.\n\nBut despite having a clear bone to pick with the president, Comey said he doesn't feel helping to stop Trump in 2020 will bring any sense of relief from his role in the 2016 election, in which many blame Hillary's loss on him.\n\n'Thanks for giving us Donald Trump,' an older woman told him as he walked through a Yale Law School building.\n\nHe had gone to Yale for a talk that focused largely on his decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's emails less than two weeks before the election.\n\n'Thank you for the feedback,' he told her.\n\n'I feel stuck,' Comey said. 'Like I can't do something else. And I couldn't look myself in the mirror if I went and did something easy'\n\nComey tells the New York Times that he gets nine hours of sleep, is working on doing 10 pull-ups in a row and is spending time being a grandfather (pictured with his wife and grandchild)\n\nThe 58-year-old snagged a multi-million dollar book deal and is hired for speaking engagements for a hefty six-figures\n\nComey said he has signed a contract to write opinion pieces for The Washington Post.\n\nIn August, he posted a photo of him holding his grandchild, with unrecognizable facial hair, captioned: 'Good to be a grandpa'.\n\nHe also revealed he is the subject of an upcoming mini-series based on his best-selling memoir A Higher Loyalty. Actor Jeff Daniels will portray Comey.\n\nAnd while he lost his $170,000-a-year job in the FBI, he now travels the country giving speeches on ethical leadership for a whopping six-figures.\n\nWhile he refused to reveal his exact rate, he said: 'It's a lot! Seriously, it's crazy.'\n\nFor now, Comey is settled down in Virginia with wife Patrice Failor.\n\n'One of my goals has been to get to 10 consecutive pull-ups,' Comey told the Times. 'I'm at nine now. So, I've been doing a lot of pull-ups.'\n\nHe posts regularly about his personal life on Instagram, revealing in May that he and his wife became grandparents.\n\nIn August, he posted a photo of him holding his grandchild, with unrecognizable facial hair, captioned: 'Good to be a grandpa'.\n\nAsked if he cared about how he would be remembered, Comey said: 'I was going to say I don't care. I'm sure I care a little.'\n\n'It frustrates me in general that millions of people have a false impression of me,' he said.\n\n'I wish they knew I was funnier.'", "description": "James Comey is adjusting to life as a self-proclaimed 'unemployed celebrity' since he was fired as FBI director in 2017.
