The main character is stuck in a coma, and the villains are nightmares. Players confront issues of anxiety and depression. And, through an all-black cast, Mr. Gooden deliberately features the experiences of people typically absent from mainstream games.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a white creator, you rarely think about that,\u201d he said.\n\nGaming is a multibillion-dollar business, and one that has remained largely white and largely male.\n\nFive years after \u201cGamergate\u201d exposed the kind of toxicity that can lurk in a community where diverse perspectives are underrepresented, little seems to have changed for minorities and women in the industry. Today, people like Mr. Gooden still confront an industry that infrequently reflects who they are.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take it one day, one year, one game at a time.\u201d Davionne Gooden Creator of She Dreams Elsewhere\n\nThree out of four people working in the gaming industry are men. Almost the same proportion is white. And those numbers have hardly budged since 2015, according to surveys conducted by the nonprofit International Game Developers Association.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a young person of color playing games, you don\u2019t really see yourself represented,\u201d said Mitu Khandaker, a professor at New York University\u2019s game center. \u201cThat kind of instills in you this sense that maybe I don\u2019t really belong.\u201d\n\nThat lack of diversity in mainstream gaming \u2014 games made by the handful of large development companies \u2014 can be cyclical, turning people away from the industry, said Ms. Khandaker, who is also the chief executive of Glow Up Games, a research and development studio focused on diversity.\n\nWomen, for example, are rarely promoted to senior positions or made the heads of studios. Many gamers say toxic harassment online is still an everyday fear.\n\nSome like Mr. Gooden, 21, see signs of hope. The most recent I.G.D.A. survey found that 81 percent of those in the industry feel that diversity in the workplace is either very important or somewhat important, up from 63 percent in 2015.\n\nAnd developers have more outlets to get their games in the hands of players, including online platforms like Steam and crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, as well as gaming conferences and festivals.\n\nMr. Gooden started making games shortly after he got his first laptop in the fifth grade and discovered a game-developing program online. He never stopped. In his most recent role-playing game, She Dreams Elsewhere, the main character, Thalia Sullivan, navigates her own mind, battling nightmares as she tries to eventually figure how she fell into a coma.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimist,\u201d Mr. Gooden said. \u201cI hope that things will eventually be better as a whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am just one or two steps removed from people who are like exploding in popularity in this very scary way.\u201d Squinky Creator of Robot Slow Dance\n\nWhen \u201cGamergate\u201d unfolded in 2014, the world was exposed to the toxic side of gaming. Spurred by a misogynistic post online from a game developer\u2019s ex-boyfriend, mobs online publicly attacked female creators and players in a targeted harassment campaign. Women routinely received rape and death threats.\n\nDietrich Squinkifer, better known as Squinky, knew many of the victims.\n\nWatching friends being targeted was scary, but not surprising for Squinky, who uses \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d pronouns. Squinky had tangled with the same culture before.\n\nThey began making games in the early 2000s. Squinky\u2019s first job in the industry was with Telltale Games, a company based in San Rafael, Calif., known for The Walking Dead, a zombie apocalypse adventure game.\n\nSquinky, 33, said that as their career progressed, they increasingly tried to advocate a better understanding of race, gender and sexuality in the industry. Colleagues saw Squinky as a troublemaker, and bosses were quick to reprimand.\n\nThey burned out of mainstream gaming.\n\nNow, Squinky pursues independent, artistic projects, like Robot Slow Dance. It\u2019s a game in which people use controllers to make two miniature foam and metal robots dance with each other.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s part of the reason a lot of my focus in my work has gone more toward more experimentality, installation and performance art, following more of an art world tradition,\u201d Squinky said. \u201cI am to some degree scared of creating something that will get popular enough within the video game world community that it does receive that kind of backlash.\u201d\n\nThe game itself is a commentary on social gender norms, which are nonexistent for robots. \u201cThey won\u2019t make the same assumptions as humans,\u201d Squinky said.\n\n\u201cI like that it\u2019s a way for me to express myself, and kind of take control of any situation that I\u2019ve had in my life.\u201d Emma Kidwell Creator of Half\n\nEmma Kidwell\u2019s father is white. Her mother is Japanese. But growing up in the overwhelmingly white, rural suburb of Walkersville, Md., she felt detached from her Japanese identity.\n\nMaking games would help her reconnect.\n\nShe became interested in gaming as a child, watching her brothers play Xbox and PlayStation. About three years ago in college, Ms. Kidwell tried building games for a narrative design class.\n\nThrough games, Ms. Kidwell, 25, found she could tell stories about her personal life. She made one about the awkwardness of buying condoms at a store; she made another about watching her grandmother grapple with dementia.\n\nIn January, her grandfather in Japan died, rekindling Ms. Kidwell\u2019s childhood uneasiness about her biracial identity. So she made the interactive, web-based game Half.\n\nThe narrative game takes the player through a series of Ms. Kidwell\u2019s memories. She wrote about feelings of wanting to look more Japanese, about how her mother stopped talking to her in Japanese and about how she was mistaken for being Chinese.\n\n\u201cSince then, I haven\u2019t felt the same really weird self-consciousness,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI want to show other people, similar to me, that they can create stuff like that \u2013 that there\u2019s a space for it.\u201d Joyce Lin Creator of Queering Spacetime\n\nIn Joyce Lin\u2019s new tabletop card game, players role-play as girls with crushes on each other. One might become Avery, who is Japanese and Scottish and pansexual, or Ioh, a Korean tomboy.\n\nDraw another card, and Avery and Ioh might meet at a gas station at 1 a.m., with one needing a ride.\n\nTogether, players craft a date: Will Ioh give Avery a ride? What is the best way the early morning can unfold, based on each character\u2019s personality traits?\n\nMs. Lin, 21, said the game, Queering Spacetime, is an attempt to put forth a positive representation of queer relationships, often overlooked in games and media.\n\n\u201cUsually, in dating sims, you have to impress a character,\u201d she said, referring to simulation games. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of one-sided.\u201d\n\nMs. Lin, who recently came out, said her game exemplified \u201cthe queer form of resistance\u201d \u2014 building safe spaces together as a shield against all that is harmful in the world.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this culture that you\u2019re supposed to be good at gaming. For me, games are not about that.\u201d Julian Cordero Co-creator of Despelote\n\nJulian Cordero, 22, loves soccer but hates its competitive culture. So, when he made a game about the sport, it wasn\u2019t about playing a match.\n\nThe game, which he made with his development partner, Sebasti\u00e1n Valbuena, 28, is called Despelote and is set in their hometown, Quito, Ecuador.\n\nIn first person, the player kicks a soccer ball around city parks, meeting people along the way.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the game for us is a game about soccer, but it\u2019s not about the competitive aspect,\u201d Mr. Cordero said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the opposite. It\u2019s about the human aspect, and the relationships that sort of develop through kicking a ball around.\u201d\n\nWith Despelote, Mr. Cordero is trying to use soccer to reject the competitiveness of gaming, which he believes engenders the misogyny and consumerism that have been endemic to the culture.\n\nMr. Cordero wants people to know that he likes making and playing games, but he\u2019s not a gamer.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t really call myself that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI saw there was a whole thing, a whole scene I never seen before.\u201d Aziza Brown Owner of Dynamik Focus\n\nAziza Brown is proud to call herself a gamer.\n\nMs. Brown, the founder and chief executive of Dynamik Focus, an e-sports and content creation team, said coverage of the industry erroneously dwelled on toxicity and \u201cGamergate\u201d when discussing the lack of diversity.\n\nOther, less sinister reasons lurk behind the demographics, she said, and they can be fixed.\n\nSome people of color may be less likely to have access to the expensive, high-speed internet connections necessary to play at a competitive level, she said. There\u2019s also what Ms. Brown called an \u201cinformation deficit\u201d \u2014 not knowing which tournaments or clubs to go to or whom to meet in the community.\n\nMs. Brown, 39, points to her own experience as representative of how things can change.\n\nGrowing up in New York, she played many video games, particularly fighting games like Street Fighter. She played in some tournaments but then went to college at Stony Brook University and studied engineering.\n\nWhen she returned, she set out to find a robust gaming community: tournaments, clubs, friends.\n\nThrough Dynamik Focus, she now tries to help others find their support groups. Ms. Brown was, for example, one of hundreds who attended an annual conference for developers of color in Harlem over the summer.\n\n\u201cI had a talk with a woman in gaming, where I was like, please come to the offline communities, come to other places, because once the anonymous barrier is gone, you can see the person to their face, you can confront them, that behavior stops,\u201d she said.", "description": "Five years after \u201cGamergate,\u201d little seems to have changed for minorities and women in the industry.
