She was glowing and expressed happiness with her performance, her relief in having fight week drama behind her, and her gratitude to be part of the UFC.\n\nFrom the opening seconds to the final horn, Jedrzejczyk picked apart Waterson, who was scrappy the entire fight. Crisp, technical striking was on full display \u2013 especially when it came to leg kicks.\n\nDespite possibly breaking her foot in either the second or third round (she couldn\u2019t remember), Jedrzejczyk continued to throw kicks with her injured limb.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super happy,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cTough fight, but dominant performance. \u2026 I took the fight second by second. I\u2019m happy, happy, happy. I\u2019m just happy.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I think I broke (my foot) at the end of the second or third round. In the fifth round, I was like, \u2018OK, I shouldn\u2019t kick with this foot.\u2019 I felt pain, but then I was like, \u2018(Expletive) it. What worse can happen? I\u2019m going to break it in three pieces? They\u2019re going to put it back together. That\u2019s it.\u2019 It\u2019s a tough business.\u201d\n\nUnlike her past fight weeks, the lead-up to UFC on ESPN+ 19 involved a lot of drama. Initially, Jedrzejczyk denied swirling rumors of a tough weight cut. However, she opened up on the reality of the situation.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw on the scale big weight, I just wanted to give a heads up,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cI\u2019m a pro. What I had to go through before the fight with Rose Namajunas, I had my fight. I was not a competitor that fight. I don\u2019t want to take anything from Rose Namajunas.\n\n\u201cShe was the champ. She\u2019s a great athlete, and she\u2019s going to become the champ probably one more time one day. But I had my fight. I\u2019m 32. I cannot put my life and health on the line. It\u2019s not worth any money. I made the weight a healthy way. I hydrated well. A big, big, big credit to the UFC Performance Institute.\u201d\n\nJedrzejczyk also denied having any sort of fallout with nutritionist George Lockhart, as was alleged by Mike Dolce on Twitter earlier in the week.\n\nWhile she wasn\u2019t able to make the call to her boss immediately after the fight, Jedrzejczyk said she was hoping to speak with UFC president Dana White as soon as possible.\n\nWhy? She wanted to tell him how much she appreciates fighting for the organization. But don\u2019t get it twisted \u2013 she isn\u2019t sucking up to him.\n\n\u201cI will call Dana definitely,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cI love him so much, and it was an honor to fight for him. It was life-changing for me signing with the UFC. I remember at the time when Lorenzo was here. But (with) the new owners, we have more possibilities. I\u2019m very blessed and happy to fight for the UFC. The best MMA organization in the world.\n\n\u201cBig thanks to Dana. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to be sweet and put a finger into his ass. But that\u2019s not true because he knows what\u2019s up.\u201d\n\nWhen she returns, Jedrzejczyk hopes to fight for the strawweight title against newly crowned champ Weili Zhang in a stadium show in Poland in Spring 2020. There is no bigger motivation for the Polish fighter than UFC gold.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Jedrzejczyk said. \u201cMy legacy is big. I don\u2019t have to prove anything to anybody, even to myself. Probably, I should stop. But I want to do this. I want to keep on doing this because it\u2019s my life. I was born for that, and I feel like it\u2019s my mission.\u201d", "description": "Joanna Jedrzejczyk was in a good after her dominant UFC Tampa win over Michelle Waterson.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dave Doyle"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/joanna-jedrzejczyk-ufc-on-espn-plus-19-post-3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
