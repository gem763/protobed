Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), which garnered only four Republican votes at the time.\n\nIt\u2019s a shift for Senate Democrats, who at times during the Trump era have voted with Republicans on high-profile bills. The shift underscores the party\u2019s growing confidence that Trump could be defeated next fall, and it comes as a number of polls have shown various Democrats defeating Trump in head-to-head match-ups.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an unpopular president doing unpopular things,\u201d said Sen.
