Pohle said the DDoS attacks don't target companies' public website, but at their backend servers, which aren't usually protected by DDoS mitigation systems and cause downtimes -- and possibly intimidating victims.\n\nIn addition, Pohle said that beyond the financial vertical, they've also seen some DDoS ransom attacks aimed at companies in the entertainment and retail business.\n\n\"The victims are threatened with a follow-up DDoS attack if they do not make a payment in bitcoin within a week,\" Radware's Smith told ZDNet. \"At the moment, no follow-up attacks have been observed.\"\n\nRevival of a 2017 trend?\n\nSmith also said the ransom letter used this past week is nearly identical to one used in 2017 by another DDoS ransom gang that also posed as Russia's Fancy Bear group.\n\nIn fact, 2017 has been the year when DDoS-based ransom demands reached their peak, with dozens of groups operating all at the same time.\n\nSome DDoS extortionists were seen posing as almost any widely-known hacking group known at the time, such as Anonymous, LulzSec, Armada Collective, New World Hackers, Lizard Squad, and Fancy Bear.\n\nOther groups didn't bother imitating better known hacking groups and tried making a name for themselves, such as Kadyrovtsy, RedDoor, ezBTC, Borya Collective, Stealth Ravens, XMR Squad, ZZb00t, Meridian Collective, Xball Team, and Collective Amadeus.\n\nIt was a free-for-all for almost the entire year, but attacks subsided as victims learned that many extortionists did not have the firepower to follow through with actual DDoS attacks.\n\nBut unlike its 2017 predecessors, this new Fancy Bear copycat that emerged last week at least appears to own an actual DDoS botnet.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that they are not the real Fancy Bear group. Russia's elite cyber-espionage and hacking unit have never been seen launching DDoS attacks. Their targets usually include embassies, NATO bases, US political parties, and government agencies.\n\nAny company receiving such email threats should report the incident to law enforcement officials.", "description": "Exclusive: Fake \"Fancy Bear\" group is demanding money from companies in the financial sector, threatening DDoS attacks.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/24/bae4e434-bb69-44ce-83a2-7df9624b0fce/thumbnail/770x578/f29a078777270dd9781a635b62d746b0/fancy-bear-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
