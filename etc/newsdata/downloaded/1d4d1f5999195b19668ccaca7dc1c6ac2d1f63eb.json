A law here would only deal with Malaysian companies. What we need is international cooperation for a long-term solution.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had said Malaysia was considering a new law to compel its companies to tackle fires on land they control abroad.\n\nYeo said Malaysia will keep up cloud seeding efforts to bring temporary relief in badly-hit areas. This involves spraying chemicals, such as sodium chloride and magnesium oxide, from aircraft in order to spur rainfall.\n\nMalaysia will also consider deploying drones to help in cloud seeding, Mahathir told a separate news conference.\n\nMalaysia's Islamic Development Department issued the text of a special plea for divine intervention to disperse the smog, to be recited after weekly prayers on Friday by mosque congregations nationwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Sipalan; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "Malaysia will push its Southeast Asian neighbours to strengthen  cooperation in finding a long-term solution for smog wafted across the region from forest fires in Indonesia, its environment minister said on Thursday.
