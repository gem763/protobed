They sold me the pastoral care, that they would keep an eye on him as a young man in a new town.\u201d\n\nCanterbury University has launched an independent investigation into the death of Pendrous, who was from Wellington. It will look at how his first absence was missed from classes, dining halls and tutorials for so long, as well as by adult staff supervising students at Sonoda.\n\nHolland said he thought his stepson was not answering his calls or texts because he was a busy, happy student, and he only grew suspicious when he phoned Pendrous and discovered the mobile had been disconnected.\n\nHolland says he remains angry and frustrated at the university and the Sonoda residence for not taking more interest in his stepson\u2019s class attendance and welfare.\n\nAccording to the Christchurch Press welfare concerns about Pendrous were noted by Sonoda staff as early as May, three full months before he died. It is unclear whether these welfare concerns were acted on.\n\n\u201cI just feel a bit frustrated that nobody, either at the university or at CLV chose after four or five weeks to chase him up. To find out why he\u2019d not been to lectures, to find out why he\u2019d not eaten,\u201d Holland told RNZs Checkpoint programme.\n\n\u201cThey swipe in for food. He didn\u2019t swipe in. So at some point, an alarm bell must rise and say, \u2018hang on, he\u2019s not eaten here for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, whatever it is\u2019.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand police are conducting an investigation into the death of Pendrous and his stepfather told Checkpoint it has still not been determined how he died.\n\nThe hall of residence where Pendrous died will no longer be used to house first-year university students from 2020. Campus Living Villages did not respond to questions on whether they pursued Pendrous\u2019 stepfather for unpaid bills when the teenager was already dead.\n\nFormer high court judge Kit Toogood QC has been hired to oversee the independent investigation into the death, and will investigate whether welfare concerns were raised about Pendrous to the university before his death, if oversight and pastoral care at Sonoda were adequate, and how his absence from classes and hall meals went unnoticed for so long.", "description": "Stepfather of Mason Pendrous says accommodation provider at Canterbury University sold him idea of pastoral care", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c37082f87f18eed6c0a0dd0e9be41df7ce6285d/1307_415_3669_2203/master/3669.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1bc89d9a344de70b54877014686590f7", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
