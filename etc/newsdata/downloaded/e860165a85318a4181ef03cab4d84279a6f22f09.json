He had not known that his son was among those killed in the bombing.\n\n\u201cIt took me a little while to understand who it was. I thought my son had been injured, not died... not like that.\n\n\u201cI tried to remain standing, but I started shaking, then I just blacked out, fell to the floor.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He deserved to know the truth. In this country, the way things are, he will see more dead bodies as he grows up, I fear so, that is the way things are.\u201d\n\nDecades of strife show no sign of ending. In the latest round of bloodshed, up to 40 people were reported to be killed on Sunday night when Afghan forces raided what they say was a bomb factory at Musa Qala, southern Helmand.\n\nSome of the deaths, they said, was due to the bomb-maker detonating a suicide vest.\n\nThe US military announced that 22 Taliban fighters were killed, with the province governor claiming six of them were foreigners.\n\nHowever, provincial councillor Abdul Majed Akhand maintained that the real figure was 28 more and that the majority of those killed were women and children at a wedding ceremony.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Many on the opposite side of this 19 year war, and us, are looking to make a deal \u2013 if possible!\u201d\n\nAround 110 people had been killed in the previous 36 hours, according to figures from the BBC and Afghan monitoring groups.\n\nThe death toll for the month stood at 74 a day on average, and the lethal violence has continued, with 112 killed in the last seven days.\n\nThe attack on the Shohar Dubai Wedding Hall in Chardahi, the day after Mr Trump\u2019s tweet, was also sectarian, taking place in a largely Shia area.\n\nAbdul Jamil was a professional musician who played in a band that performed at marriage ceremonies. He had, however, gone to that party as a guest.\n\n\u201cI heard that he was right next to the stage when this man blew up the bomb. A friend, a fellow band member he was with died instantly, another one nine days later.\n\n\u201cI had been told that Abdul Jamil had a leg broken, so that\u2019s why it was such a shock when I saw him...\" Abdul Latif\u2019s voice faded away as he put his head in his hands, then he apologised for crying.\n\nAbdul Jamil was the main breadwinner for his wife, three children and parents. He brought home 30,000 (\u00a3308) Afghanis a week. His father, a school caretaker earns 5,000 Afghanis.\n\n\u201cIt is hard, we have to think about every coin we spend, on what we can afford to eat, to make sure we spend on the children everything we can\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was such a waste, what happened. We loved our son, everyone liked him, and then he was killed by a man who did not even know him.\n\n\u201cBut that is what happens throughout Afghanistan, families suffering. We now get worried if we can\u2019t find our children or if they are away for a long time,\n\n\"We want them to have a good future, but we are worried about them.\u201d\n\nSamir, a friendly, polite boy had returned from school while his grandfather was speaking.\n\nHis favourite subject, he said, was English, eagerly demonstrating this by writing the alphabet and a couple of sentences. He wants to be a doctor, he said, to \u201chelp people who are hurt\u201d.\n\nThe Taliban position on education, in any future government they are part of or run, is that they are all for it as long the contents are within Muslim tenets. Classes will be segregated between boys and girls, men and women, at all levels.\n\nTeachers, however, have been murdered by the Taliban during the years of insurgency on allegations of introducing un-Islamic views into the classroom and, on occasions, of being spies.\n\nGirls\u2019 schools have been targeted, including two burned down in Logar four months ago for employing male teachers.\n\nSixty two schools are now shut in Logar, 29 in Takhar and 22 in Kunduz. Some of the closures, explained the Taliban, are because they were due to be used as polling centres in the election.\n\nWhile all \u201carmed invaders\u201d must leave the country, the Talibs \u2013 meaning Taliban members \u2013 have declared they would welcome foreign aid and engage in international diplomacy.\n\nBut attacks have continued to target foreign civilians.\n\nEarlier this month, just hours after Mr Khalilzad showed a draft agreement on the Doha talks to President Ghani, a truck bomb exploded outside the Green Village in the outskirts of Kabul, followed by gunmen bursting into the compound where most of the residents are from abroad.\n\nSixteen people were killed, six of them foreign, and 119 wounded.\n\nFive of the attackers were killed in firefights, 400 residents evacuated. A number of Western countries pulled out their personnel from Afghanistan in the aftermath.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabibullah Mujahid said: \u201cWe understand that peace talks are going on...But they must also understand that we are not weak and if we enter into talks, we enter from a strong position,\n\n\u201cThey need to realise they can\u2019t stop the Taliban.\u201d\n\nMujib Rahman was watching television at his home across the road when the suicide bomber detonated the truck bomb at around ten in the evening.\n\n\u201cIt was so loud that I thought it was a bomb from a plane. There was smoke and dust everywhere. I was thrown across the room and then became unconscious.\u201d\n\nMujib sustained injuries to his chest and right hand from the shrapnel and flying glass and was kept in hospital for a week. He has returned to his job, driving a three-wheeled auto-rickshaw, or zaranj, but had to stop after a few hours a day because of pain.\n\n\u201cI suppose I should think that I am lucky I did not die, so many others did that day. But this can happen again, you cannot plan anything much for the future, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen\u201d he said.\n\nMujib\u2019s 55-year-old father Ainuddin \u2013 who like many Afghans uses one name \u2013 said that schools had been shut early and children sent home because, the teachers said, a bombing was expected in the area.\n\n\u201cI told my family and others to sleep outside the house. But there have been so many bombs in Kabul recently, they did not want to listen\u201d he recalled.\n\n\u201cAnd then when nothing happened during the day, we thought it was safe. There have been problems with Green Village before because there are foreigners there.\u201d\n\nAngry locals held a march the next day that quickly turned to violence, with authorities blaming insurgent agent provocateurs for the trouble.\n\nThe police opened fire in response injuring three people who needed hospital treatment, according to locals.\n\nSome Afghans hold that despite all that\u2019s going on, it is pointless being too pessimistic.\n\nAhmed Orakzai, who missed a bombing in Kabul last week killing 22 people by just 200 meters, said: \u201cIf people have the money they can go abroad or some try the stupid smuggling route to leave.\n\n\u201cBut most people have no choice but to stay, it is our country, we must do the best we can.\u201d\n\nThe 38-year-old businessman continued: \u201cWe have an election coming and everyone should take part. We are glad that Trump isn\u2019t just pulling his soldiers out, then the Taliban would really have won.\n\n\u201cOur forces are doing most of fighting now and just need the Americans to provide things like air [support], which is necessary.\n\n\u201cThe West knows that it played a part in putting us where we are today, it\u2019s in the history, so they bear some responsibility. The Americans need to stay for just a bit longer, not too long.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s costing them money, but it is us who are doing most of the dying.\u201d", "description": "Abdul Latif fainted when he saw the body lying on a mortuary table covered in blood, the throat torn apart.
