Teslas are sick, I guess?\"\n\nThe video appears to show the driver and a passenger asleep while the vehicle operates in Autopilot, a driver-assist technology that has come under fire in recent years for a design that contributed, at least in part, to accidents.\n\nIt's unknown whether the driver was actually asleep at the wheel, or attempting a hoax. Other Tesla owners have posted related prank videos online in the past.\n\nMassachusetts State Police told a local TV station that they are aware of the video but no report has been filed. Tesla did not immediately have a response to the video.\n\nAutopilot enables Tesla vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within their lanes, and move into different lanes. According to Tesla's website, \"Current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.\" However, those terms haven't stopped users from mistaken over-reliance on, or deliberate abuse of the Autopilot system.\n\nSunday's video was the most recent in a litany of social media posts showing drivers misusing Autopilot, or finding workarounds so they don't have to actively touch the steering wheel \u2013 Tesla's way of attempting to keep the driver active.", "description": "In videos shared online and with CNBC, Tesla drivers were caught apparently asleep at the wheel, a violation of the company's terms of use for Autopilot.", "authors": ["Lora Kolodny Michael Wayland", "Lora Kolodny", "Michael Wayland"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105205971-GettyImages-494411538.jpg?v=1532563640", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
