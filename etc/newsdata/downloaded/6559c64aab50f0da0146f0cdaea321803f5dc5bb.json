Bush's dog Sully", "language": "en", "text": "A program that trains service dogs for disabled veterans has commissioned a bronze statue of the late George H.W. Bush\u2019s service dog Sully to be displayed in the 41st president\u2019s library in Texas.\n\nAmerica's VetDogs commissioned sculptor Susan Bahary to create the statue, which will be placed in the east wing of the Bush library at Texas A&M University in College Station.\n\nThe 3-year-old yellow labrador assisted Bush during the last six months of his life before he passed in November 2018 at the age of 94.\n\nGEORGE H.W. BUSH\u2019S SERVICE DOG, SULLY, IS HONORED: 'MISSION COMPLETE'\n\nSully gained national attention when a Bush family spokesperson tweeted a photo of the dog next to Bush's casket while he was lying in state at the Capitol Rotunda, saying: \"Mission complete.\"\n\nAccording to a post on the dog's Instagram account, the statue will depict the dog sitting with his leash in his mouth. The image is meant to convey the \"retrieve\" task the dog is trained to perform, VetDogs President John Miller said.\n\nThe statue will also show him wearing his America's VetDogs vest with the Great Seal of the United States on its back.\n\nIn February, Sully joined the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center\u2019s Facility Dog Program, where he works with other dogs to assist wounded military personnel, according to VetDogs.\n\nThe Bush family contacted Walter Reed about bringing Sully in after former First Lady Barbara Bush died in April 2018.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"As much as our family is going to miss this dog, we\u2019re comforted to know he\u2019ll bring the same joy to his new home, Walter Reed, that he brought to 41,\" former President George W. Bush had posted to Instagram in December.\n\nSully was named after retired airline pilot Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger III, who saved 155 people on board a damaged passenger jet in 2009 by safely landing it on the Hudson River in New York.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A program that trains service dogs for disabled veterans has commissioned a bronze statue of\u00a0the\u00a0late George H.W.
