They have said I am fit for work.\n\nMy COPD is in the advanced stage and the tests they give you \u2013 I am not hitting the targets. I\u2019m absolutely exhausted. I struggle to get up the stairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I struggle to get out of the house often because I struggle so much. I\u2019m really housebound.\u2019\n\nShe was told she was fit to work after a DWP assessment (Picture: NCJ Media)\n\nMs Barrass, from Wallsend near Newcastle, said she had been receiving \u00a3220 every fortnight as part of her ESA and another \u00a3300 a month from PIP.\n\nThis week the DWP asked Ms Barrass to attend a reassessment and her \u00a3300 a month has been restored until a hearing takes place.\n\nHowever this slight respite has done little to help, as the situation has taken its toll on her mental health and has left her suffering from anxiety and depression.\n\nShe said: \u2018When they stopped all my money I didn\u2019t have a thing. I just want to kill myself. I\u2019m really, really struggling.\u2019\n\nA DWP spokesperson said: \u2018We\u2019re committed to ensuring that disabled people and those with health conditions get the support they\u2019re entitled to.\n\n\u2018Decisions about entitlement to ESA are made based on all the information provided, including from a GP or medical specialist.\n\n\u2018Following a request from Ms Barrass we are reviewing our decision to find her fit for work. She continues to receive support through Personal Independence Payment.\u2019\n\nNeed support?
