REUTERS/Christopher Pike/Files\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will get two additional cargoes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from United Arab Emirate\u2019s Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) to make up for a shortfall from Saudi Arabia, two government officials said.\n\nIndia\u2019s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier in the day tweeted that ADNOC had agreed to give two additional cargos of LPG on an urgent basis to meet higher demand in the upcoming festive season. He said the cargoes will reach India in the next two months.\n\nThe sources said additional supplies from ADNOC would compensate for lower imports from Saudi Arabia, which has lowered refinery runs to meet its oil exports commitment after attacks on its oil facilities.\n\nThe Sept. 14 attacks on the Abqaiq and Khurais plants, some of the kingdom\u2019s biggest, halved the crude output of the world\u2019s top oil exporter, shutting down 5.7 million barrels per day of production.", "description": "India will get two additional cargoes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from United Arab Emirate's Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) to make up for a shortfall from Saudi Arabia, two government officials said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433359725&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N187", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
