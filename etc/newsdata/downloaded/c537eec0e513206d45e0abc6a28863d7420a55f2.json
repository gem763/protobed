Bolton brought useful credentials to the job: decades of foreign policy experience and a keen grasp of how the gears of government turn.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s main problem, as it turned out, was that he knew too much. Confident in his experience to a fault, he was unwilling to shade his deeply held hawkish views, which he defended with a prickly personality that alienated colleagues \u2014 and ultimately President Trump himself, leading to his ouster last week.\n\nRobert C. O\u2019Brien, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to succeed Mr. Bolton, flips that equation. He is a former Los Angeles lawyer with limited government experience before he became the State Department\u2019s point man for hostage negotiations. But his friends all cite an affable, ingratiating personality that has earned him allies throughout the Trump administration, notably including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, both of whom supported his appointment.\n\nHis physical appearance did not hurt, either. Whereas Mr. Trump was known to grouse about Mr. Bolton\u2019s famous bushy mustache, the president has been taken with Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s well-tailored looks and easy demeanor, and thinks he \u201clooks the part,\u201d as one person close to the president said.", "description": "Mr. O\u2019Brien, President Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, is said to bring milder views and a sunnier personality to the job than John R.
