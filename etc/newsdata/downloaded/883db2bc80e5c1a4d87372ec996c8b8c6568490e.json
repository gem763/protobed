Now, if you receive an email claiming to be from Instagram, you can check if it\u2019s genuine by heading over to the \u201cEmails from Instagram\u201d option in the app\u2019s Security settings, which lists every email the service has sent you over the last 14 days. The update is rolling out now and may take time to appear in your settings.\n\nThe new menu divides your Instagram emails into two categories; security emails and \u201cother.\u201d If you see an email in there then you can be sure it\u2019s legitimate, and you can safely click any links it contains. If it\u2019s not, then it could be a phishing scam, whereby someone impersonates a service to trick you into giving them your username and password. In this case, you should probably delete the offending email. If the worst happens and your account gets compromised, then Instagram says you should follow the instructions listed on its help page.\n\nGrid View The new feature can be found in the app\u2019s security menu.

Some phishing scams can even break into accounts that use two-factor authentication using a fake site that asks for your six-digit code and immediately enters that into the real site on behalf of the scammer. Reply All did a great episode on this a couple of years ago if you\u2019re interested in learning more. It\u2019s still a good idea to enable two-factor authentication where possible, just know that you\u2019ll still have to exercise caution with your online accounts.", "description": "Instagram has added a new feature to its app to help users work out if a suspicious email is a phishing scam.
