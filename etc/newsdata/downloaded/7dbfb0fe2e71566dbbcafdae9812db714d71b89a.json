Meanwhile, Loughlin, 55, plans to fight the charges against her and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, 56, which Lelling notes may not work out in her favor.\n\n\u201cIt just happened to be that Ms. Huffman was probably the least culpable of the defendants who we\u2019ve charged in that case,\u201d he said. \u201cShe took responsibility almost immediately, she was contrite, did not try to minimize her conduct. I think she handled it in a very classy way.\u201d\n\nMOSSIMO GIANNULLI, LORI LOUGHLIN HATE 'CHEATER' LABEL IN COLLEGE SCAM\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we thought the one month was proportional,\u201d he said of prosecutors\u2019 initial sentence recommendation for Huffman. \u201cI think the two weeks that she actually got was also reasonable. We were happy with that. I think it was a thoughtful sentence.\u201d\n\nLelling concluded by noting that Huffman\u2019s prison sentence sends a clear message to others involved with the case that even the least-culpable defendant is serving some time behind bars.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud earlier this year. She confessed to paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her older daughter's answers on the SAT. She considered the same for her younger daughter but decided against it.\n\nLORI LOUGHLIN, MOSSIMO GIANNULLI'S OPTIONS ARE 'LIMITED' AFTER PLEADING NOT GUILTY IN COLLEGE SCAM\n\nIn addition to having to self-report to prison on Oct. 25, she also received one year of probation, was ordered to perform 250 hours of community service and pay a $30,000 fine.\n\nMeanwhile, Loughlin, 55, and her husband were accused of paying $500,000 to alleged scam mastermind William \"Rick\" Singer to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella recruited onto the University of Southern California's crew team despite neither girl ever being a rower. USC put the girls' enrollment statuses on hold amid an internal investigation into the scandal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe pair rejected the plea deal that other parents allegedly involved in the case \u2013 including Huffman \u2013 accepted. Giannulli, 56, and Loughlin then were hit with additional charges of money laundering and conspiracy and would face up to 40 years behind bars if convicted on all charges.\n\nFox News' Jessica Sager contributed to this report.", "description": "Lori Loughlin will likely face a tougher sentence than Felicity Huffman if convicted for her role in the college admissions scandal.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/lori-loughlin-felicity-huffman-college-scandal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
