That\u2019s hard against good football teams.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles (3-4) trail the first-place Cowboys, who snapped a three-game losing streak, by one game in the NFC East. They will play their third straight road game next Sunday, against the Buffalo Bills (5-1).\n\nAfter the Eagles won the coin toss, Pederson elected to receive a kickoff for only the second time in 33 opportunities during his four seasons as Philadelphia\u2019s coach. The Eagles were shut out in four of six previous first quarters this season.\n\nTheir first drive ended at their 45-yard line when tight end Dallas Goedert was hit by Jaylon Smith and fumbled with Maliek Collins recovering. Six plays later, the Cowboys scored on a 20-yard run by receiver Tavon Austin on an option pitch around right end.\n\nThe Eagles\u2018 second possession lasted only two plays. DeMarcus Lawrence had a strip sack of Carson Wentz with Dallas taking over at Philadelphia\u2019s 14. The Cowboys needed only two plays to score again, Ezekiel Elliott running around left end after barely being pulled down at the 1 on the previous play.\n\n\u201cA little embarrassed - we didn\u2019t show up,\u201d Wentz said.\n\nDallas\u2019 27-7 halftime lead marked the most points that the Eagles have allowed in a first half this season and the most in any half under Pederson. They\u2019ve trailed at intermission five times this season, rallying to win only once (trailing the Washington Redskins 20-7 in Week 1 in a 32-27 win.)\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s only first-half scoring drive, ending in a 28-yard touchdown catch by Goedert over the middle, was kept alive by a third-down roughing-the-passer call against Smith and later aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty against Xavier Woods.\n\nThe Eagles allowed 37 points after giving up a season-high 38 to the Vikings. The defense allowed a season-high 189 rushing yards on Sunday night with Elliott being the first opposing back to break triple figures (111).\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t closing our gaps,\u201d linebacker Nathan Gerry said. \u201cWe were giving them too much space. Zeke is a good running back. You give him a little crease, he\u2019s going to find the crease and he\u2019s going to make a play out of it. We\u2019ve just got to do a good job of eliminating the size of those gaps.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia was a season-worst minus-3 in the turnover battle (4-1) with Wentz losing two fumbles and throwing an interception.\n\n\u201cIt puts the defense in a bind,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, early especially.\u201d\n\nPederson said the loss was \u201ceither one or two\u201d among his worst as Eagles coach. He said his team came to AT&T; Stadium well prepared, but Gerry said the Eagles needed to perform better during the week leading up to the game.\n\n\u201cWe have to practice better throughout the week,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to bring better energy throughout the week. We just have to be a better football team going forward.\u201d\n\nWentz said he doesn\u2019t see a team that\u2019s coming apart following two disappointing performances.\n\n\u201cI love that locker room,\u201d he said. \u201cI obviously think these losses - you never want to lose - but I think it\u2019s going to pull us together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long season. We can get these things fixed, get it going in the right direction. I\u2019ve been with these guys. I know what they\u2019re all capable of.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson boldly said last week that his team would forget the previous day's road loss to the Minnesota Vikings, go to Dallas, and \"win that football game\" against the Cowboys.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/eagles_cowboys_football_72524_c0-252-3631-2370_s1200x700.jpg?e9e5348b0b1b8327a7e12ff528e4255260dde08f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
