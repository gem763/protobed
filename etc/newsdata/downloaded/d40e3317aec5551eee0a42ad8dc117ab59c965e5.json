Jordanian officials say the kingdom hosts some 1 million Syrians who have fled the fighting.\n\n\u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to ISIS, Iran and Russia,\u201d said the statement, using the Islamic State group\u2019s acronym.\n\nJordan\u2019s state news agency Petra said Abdullah stressed the importance of safeguarding Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and guarantees for the \u201csafe and voluntary\u201d return of refugees.\n\n\u201cThe meeting also covered regional and international efforts to counter terrorism within a comprehensive approach,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe Congressional delegation included Democrats Rep.
