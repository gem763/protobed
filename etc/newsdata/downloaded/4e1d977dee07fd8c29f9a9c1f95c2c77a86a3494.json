Any suggestions? I have a dropping green plant for the edge of the bath but just don't know what colour scheme to go with.'\n\nHundreds of people commented beneath the photos to say they were interested in learning how she did it, and were surprised by the swift response.\n\n'I used the Dulux white gloss renovation range for tiles and benchtops ($69.90) on the floor and window frame,' she said.\n\n'And the White Knight tub and basic paint ($95.90) for the bath.'\n\nFor less than $200 the bathroom has undergone a complete makeover with the help of some white paint - and there is more magic to come.\n\n'I used the Dulux white gloss renovation range for tiles and benchtops ($69.90) on the floor and window frame,' she said\n\n'And the White Knight tub and basic paint ($95.90) for the bath,' she continued\n\n'WOW! What a gorgeous improvement! Some greenery will make it pop for sure. And maybe one of those across the bath caddy things with some nice candles or bath bombs,' one person suggested.\n\n'It will definitely look even better if you paint the walls white... it will make the room look larger too,' said another.\n\nA third added: 'I'd put a heap of plants using cane woven baskets to match the lovely piece above the toilet.'\n\n'You could then accent with items such as towels, candles, toothbrush holders etc in your favourite colour. I'd go pink but lots of colours would match now. You could also get some frosted/patterned contact for the window that will block the view but still let light in.'\n\nThe woman will likely return to Facebook again to post the results of her complete revamp.", "description": "A woman with a very 'unique' brown bathroom has completely transformed it in a matter of days using just two tubs of white paint from Bunnings.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/00/19564272-0-image-a-24_1570751193932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
