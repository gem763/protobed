The RLIF is expected to appoint an interim board in the coming days.\n\nThe country\u2019s clubs have registered Tonga Ma\u2019a Tonga Rugby League, which has the backing of the Tonga Sports Council and the nation\u2019s NRL players, and it is expected to take over the administration of the Mate Ma\u2019a.\n\nKristian Woolf, whose sacking led to 27 players threatening to refuse to turn out for the Mate Ma\u2019a and calling for the TNRL board to stand down, will also be reinstated. Given Woolf has the likes of Will Hopoate, Michael Jennings, Daniel Tupou, Kotoni Staggs and David Fusitu\u2019a at his disposal, Folau will not be considered for selection.\n\nWhile the result of the RLIF\u2019s decision is that Folau\u2019s return to league will be blocked, ARLC chairman and RLIF deputy chairman Beattie said that was never the intention. \u201cIsrael Folau\u2019s name wasn\u2019t even mentioned. Because this has never been about him, it\u2019s been about resolving this internal dispute in Tonga,\u201d Beattie said.\n\nFolau was sacked by Rugby Australia earlier in the year after he refused to remove anti-homosexual social media posts. Beattie and NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg refused to consider Folau for NRL registration after he walked out on the game for AFL in 2010 and because they were wary of him reoffending and damaging relationships with sponsors.\n\nThe issue came to a head this week after the prime minister of Tonga, Semisi Sika, wrote to the RLIF to state that the TNRL had lost the support of the government, the country\u2019s players and clubs.\n\nIsrael Folau offered to issue apology, Rugby Australia alleges in court documents Read more\n\n\u201cWe want Tonga\u2019s best team on the park and we support the NRL\u2019s best Tongan players,\u201d Beattie said. The TNRL now has seven days to launch an appeal.\n\nGreenberg, who is also on the RLIF board, said that once an alternative board is in place, Tonga would be able to appear at the upcoming World Nines \u2013 a tournament which is run by the NRL.\n\n\u201cIt is clear the current board does not have the support of its national government or its best players,'\u2019 Greenberg said. \u201cWe are working with the RLIF to recognise an alternate structure that provides an opportunity for Tonga to field its best team.\u201d", "description": "Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter Beattie denies the decision to suspend Tonga\u2019s international membership was based on an attempt to block Israel Folau\u2019s return", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cee9bc9ff11c714d0838b0784e1073579cb09b62/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=762421e464345ffca3ac604e07bb68d1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
