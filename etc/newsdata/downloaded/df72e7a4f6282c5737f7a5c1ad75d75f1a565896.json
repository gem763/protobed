The wild horses will instinctually seek cover in wooded high grounds, standing in tight circles with their butts out like a reverse phalanx.\n\n\u201cAfter all that time, the herd just knows,\u201d Puckett told The Washington Post by phone on Thursday, as wind hummed in the background, announcing Dorian\u2019s inevitable approach up the coast. \u201cThat information is passed down from generation to generation.\u201d\n\nPuckett\u2019s group in Corolla, N.C., manages and conserves about 100 feral horses that roam the northern edge of the nearly 200-mile stretch of sand-swept barrier islands, along with an additional 17 that permanently reside in a stable.\n\nThe state\u2019s Park Service manages another group of about 100 horses on the southern tip of the island chain, Puckett said, and an additional 50 or so are privately managed.\n\nPuckett stayed behind to care for the stabled horses after stocking up on hay, grain and water. ID tags braided into their manes will help track them should they break free.\n\nThe stabled horses have either been injured or habituated to human touch and food, which necessitated their removal from the wild, she said. The horses never leave their care once they enter the stable.\n\nOrigin legends for the mustangs have persisted nearly as long as they have found a home on the islands and thrived in the salty marsh.\n\nThey are thought to be descendants of horses that swam ashore after the shipwrecks that ringed the Outer Banks with such frequency that the region has been called \u201cthe Graveyard of the Atlantic.\u201d\n\nOthers believe they were simply abandoned by the Spaniards after various violent clashes with Native Americans and English settlers.\n\nThe horses are remarkably resilient in the harsh conditions, where fresh water and vegetation often give way to sand and salt. And they don\u2019t scare like domestic horses. Facing a hurricane or a threat, they endure. \u201cIt says a lot about their resourcefulness and hardiness,\u201d Puckett said. \u201cThey have an incredible will to survive.\u201d\n\nRuined crops, salty soil: How rising seas are poisoning North Carolina\u2019s farmland\n\nThat will has been tested by humankind this past century.\n\nAn estimated 5,000 wild horses lived on the entire stretch of the Outer Banks in the 1920s, Puckett said, but soon after Works Progress Administration projects sprang up, they were deemed a nuisance and slaughtered in large numbers after bounties were placed on their heads.\n\nNow, development has diminished their habitat, pushing them to the fringes of the barrier islands. And since they are a nonnative species, they don\u2019t meet some criteria for federal endangered-animal protection, CBS News reported.\n\nIn 2010, the Spanish mustang became the state horse of North Carolina, even as their future remains far from certain. Conservationists have focused their efforts on genetic diversity to keep mares and foals healthy, Puckett said.\n\nTheir loss would be a chip on the cornerstone of U.S. history. Horses linked battlefield communications in the Revolutionary War, churned under cavalrymen in the Civil War and carried frontiersmen on their backs ever westward.\n\nAll those horses have wild North Carolina mustang in their blood, Puckett said.\n\nA favorite of hers is Amadeo, a chestnut-colored stallion in his 30s. Amadeo was blinded in a fight in 2013 and swept into a rip current. Rescuers plucked him from the water using Jet Skis and tow ropes. Now, he\u2019s a 650-pound diplomat for conservationists.\n\n\u201cHe loves kids,\u201d Puckett said.\n\nShe is not concerned over Dorian\u2019s approach. Many hurricanes have come and gone for 500 years, and the horses remain.\n\nIf they ever disappear, it\u2019s unlikely that a hurricane will be the culprit.\n\nRead more:\n\nDismissed as a forgery, could a mysterious stone found near Roanoke\u2019s \u2018Lost Colony\u2019 be real?\n\nVirginia Dare\u2019s unwanted legacy: A white nationalist-friendly website called Vdare\n\nFrom 2014: On N.C.\u2019s Outer Banks, scary climate-change predictions prompt a change of forecast", "description": "The wild horses will instinctually seek cover in wooded high grounds, standing in tight circles with their butts out like a reverse phalanx.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C6VOGHGP3AI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
