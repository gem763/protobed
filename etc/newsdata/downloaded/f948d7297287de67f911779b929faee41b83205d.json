(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nThe inspector general for the Department of Housing and Urban Development cleared Secretary Ben Carson of misconduct in the ordering of a $31,000 dining room set for his secretarial suite, according to a copy of the investigation obtained Thursday by The Washington Post.\n\nThe investigation was launched more than a year ago following accusations that Carson had violated federal law in 2017 by ordering furniture above the $5,000 legal limit for office redecorating without notifying congressional appropriators.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence indicating that either Secretary or Mrs. Carson exerted improper influence on any departmental employee in connection with the procurement,\u201d the 14-page report said.\n\nHUD officials had failed to notify congressional appropriations committees, as required by law, when it obligated $31,561 in agency funds to buy new dining room furniture for Carson\u2019s office suite in December 2017, the inspector general said. But Carson ultimately canceled the order in March 2018 following media reports about the large purchase order.\n\nThe investigation concluded that the purchase order was initiated after HUD staff determined that the 30-year-old furniture in Carson\u2019s suite was in poor condition and should be replaced. Staff also told Carson that departmental funds were available and that the money would be lost if not spent by a certain date, the report said. The evidence showed that Carson was \u201cfine\u201d with replacing the furniture but left the details to his staff and his wife, Candy Carson, who provided \u201cstylistic input.\u201d\n\nCarson told investigators that it \u201cseemed like\u201d he had heard before the order being placed that he could not spend more than $5,000 to improve his office space, but said he was under the impression that the dollar limit applied only to his personal office \u2014 not to his entire suite, the report said. Carson said he first learned about the price tag for the dining room set from media reports. Candy Carson declined to be interviewed during the inspector general\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe agency later acknowledged that placing such a large furniture order without notifying Congress violated federal law, and that it historically has lacked effective controls to avoid such scenarios, the report said. The $5,000 redecorating allotment for the offices of presidentially appointed officials had already been used to replace the blinds in Carson\u2019s secretarial suite.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s investigation blamed department officials for the oversight.\n\n\u201cGiven that the plain language of governing appropriations law expressly prohibits obligating in excess of $5,000 to purchase \u2018furniture\u2019 for use in the \u2018suite of offices\u2019 \u201d controlled by the department head, the report said, \u201cwe believe that department officials involved in this process should have been aware that notification to Congress was required here. The fact that evidently no one involved in this procurement had such awareness indicates a systemic failure.\u201d\n\nThe agency has since reviewed its procurement procedures and established better controls, the report said.\n\nAt least one person at HUD, though, had flagged the $5,000 spending limit. Helen Foster, the agency\u2019s former chief administrative officer, had said in a complaint that she was instructed by staffers to \u201cfind money\u201d after she expressed concerns about the legality of the office expenses. Foster subsequently accused the agency of demoting her in retaliation for raising those concerns and later resigned.\n\n\u201cThe people involved in this furniture procurement all reported to me, and everyone was aware of the $5,000 limit and the requirement to notify Congress,\u201d Foster said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThey were not clueless. The decision to pursue the dining set happened the month after I was removed.\"\n\nFoster, who was not mentioned in the inspector general\u2019s report, said she was interviewed as part of the investigation.\n\nCarson, in an interview with FOX Business Network\u2019s \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d on Thursday, said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the media coverage of the furniture debacle.\n\n\u201cThey try to claim that I want to buy expensive furniture while I\u2019m trying to take money away from the poor people. That was the only narrative that they were interested in,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably no one in Washington who cares less about furniture than I do.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report was first obtained by Fox News.", "description": "The year-long investigation found no evidence that Carson or his wife exerted improper influence over a controversial $31,561 order to replace office dining room furniture.", "authors": ["Tracy Jan", "Reporter Covering The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy", "Tracy Jan Covers The Intersection Of Race", "The Economy For The Washington Post.
