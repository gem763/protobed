On Thursday, he took his criticisms of president\u2019s political opponents to a different level.\n\nAfter noting that former Vice President Joe Biden has been in politics longer \u201cthan I have been alive,\u201d he said that politics is inherently corrupt and \"creates an evilness.\"\n\n\u201cPolitics is not something that I love. It's not something I am passionate about,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt's not something, quite frankly, that I'd ever want to do myself.\u201d\n\nTrump spoke with Yahoo Finance anchor Adam Shapiro at the Yahoo Finance All Market Summit in New York City on Thursday about running the Trump Organization. Trump has been running the family business with his older brother Don Jr. since their father became president in 2017.\n\nHe said that Hunter Biden made $600,000 a year working for \"a little company in Ukraine\" but that it\u2019s systematic of a larger problem \u2013 of people going to Washington who then \"never want to leave\" adding \"It's very very sad.\"\n\nBoard members of Exxon Mobil (one of the worlds largest and most prestigious energy companies) make $330,000 annually.\n\n\n\nHunter Biden, with no industry knowledge or duties, was being paid $600,000 annually.\n\n\n\nAll of this while the average annual salary in Ukraine is $1700 per year. \u2014 Eric Trump (@EricTrump) October 10, 2019\n\nDespite the repeated allegations from President Trump and his allies, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor-general told Bloomberg in an interview that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son. Yuriy Lutsenko said in the interview that \"Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws.\"\n\nEric Trump repeatedly swatted away questions about the Trump Organization's own apparent conflicts of interest. Trump, for example, has many business ties with Turkey. The Trump Towers in Istanbul is nearly 40 stories tall and described by the Trump organization as \"a landmark in the historic city of Istanbul.\" Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, attended the opening in 2012.\n\nIn a phone call this past Sunday, President Trump agreed to withdraw U.S troops allowing a Turkish military action against Kurdish forces in Northern Syria who have long fought alongside Americans. \u201cWe are out of there,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the conversation, Eric Trump touted the Istanbul towers and said licensing deals had allowed the Trump Organization to work with partners to get access to different worldwide markets. Creating ties with local officials gives local knowledge \u201cthat you don't know if you're trying to go into Turkey, and so the model was actually very good for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout the wide-ranging conversation, Eric Trump saved his harshest words for Democrats, but also suggested that politics was corrupting for everyone involved in it. When Mitch McConnell, who has been in the U.S. Senate since 1985, was brought up, Trump noted that, \"I think it's systematic in politics. I'm one person who would love to see term limits be in there.\"\n\n\"Money has corrupted politics in a big way. You see a lot of very shady things happening,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I think it's very, very sad.\"\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s use Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders just as a comparison,\u201d he said. \u201cIn New York, they\u2019ll be best friends because they have one goal in mind and that\u2019s to build the greatest company or to develop the greatest widget.\u201d But he added that in politics, \u201cwhat really motivates people? Oftentimes, it\u2019s greed.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has paid his children about $35 million for their work in the Trump organization, according to a Forbes estimate. The president has maintained the vast majority of the assets in his name.\n\nEric Trump attends a rally of his father U.S. President Donald Trump in West Virginia in August 2017.

In October 2000, Donald Trump announced the creation of a presidential exploratory committee as a candidate of the Reform Party. He ended the campaign about five months later.", "description": "Eric Trump has been one of his father's staunchest defenders and he took his criticisms of president\u2019s political opponents to another level on Thursday.", "authors": ["Ben Werschkul", "Dc Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gYU5Y3GsWP0mNUvKfBYIUA--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/079ef010-eace-11e9-b3fc-c21c662aaf13", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
