It has long been a problem, but in the shallow waters of the EU swimming pool, it has at least been more or less manageable, at least with a little migrant help.\n\nTrouble is, the UK is preparing to perform a deep dive into a very cold and deep sea, one with a global eco-storm clearly visible on the horizon. And then there are the ships of the robot navy, with guns primed to blow up jobs. That weight could easily lead to UK plc drowning.\n\nToday PwC, the consultancy firm, releases the results of a global study on attitudes to technology and skills.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis is by no means one of those cheap, seat of the pants polls designed to grab a headline or two. Some 22,000 people were surveyed by Opinium in 11 countries, including 2,004 UK adults aged 18-65 (excluding retirees).\n\nOver half (54 per cent) of UK respondents, and 67 per cent of 18-34-year-olds, said they were ready to learn new skills or even completely retrain in order to improve future employability.\n\nBut despite this, more than half (51 per cent) also said they hadn\u2019t been given any opportunity to do that, the lowest number of any of the countries included in the exercise. The figures for dynamic economies well equipped to handle the impact of new technologies like India (91 per cent) and China (79 per cent) put us to shame.\n\nFor the record, the other nations in the survey were the US, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, France, Singapore, South Africa and Poland.\n\nReturning to Britain, the exercise revealed that as well as a gender pay gap there is marked gender skilling gap, with men (54 per cent) more likely to be offered training opportunities than women (46 per cent).\n\nSkilled graduates also do a lot better than non-graduates, which is pertinent given that it is lower-skilled jobs that are most likely to be affected by the rise of automation. Older workers lose out compared to younger ones.\n\nThe report on the results also cites PwC\u2019s annual CEO survey, which found that eight in 10 top bosses see the availability of skills as a top priority.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

PwC says the employers it speaks to recognise the issue but say it will take time and investment to address. Stop me if you\u2019ve heard that before.\n\nThe firm\u2019s UK chair, Kevin Ellis, warns that if action is not taken \u201cswathes of people risk being left behind, exacerbating social and economic inequalities\u201d.\n\nHis point is well made. Those inequalities are at the core of some of the nation\u2019s most deep-rooted problems. They have been left to fester for years and have lately started to make themselves felt.\n\nHe calls for a combined effort to address the issue including from government and NGOs as well as business. Again, the point is well made. The chancellor/financial PR man for Boris Johnson, Sajid Javid, talked a great deal about skills as part of his pre-election attempt to bribe voters with their own money. Some of it will be spent further education colleges. He went to one. So did I. They\u2019re a good place to pick up skills but they have suffered from a longstanding funding drought courtesy of his party.\n\nJavid is hardly the first minister to make a fuss about the issue of skills. But their combined efforts to address the issue have proven less than successful. The report makes that very clear, at a time when the government is proposing to slam the door shut on the migrants who have played such an important role in mitigating the impact of shortages.\n\nOne of the government\u2019s flagship policies is the apprenticeship levy which, although it has recently been tweaked, is loathed by business and has proven less than successful in generating new apprenticeship starts.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for a rethink? Perhaps it\u2019s just time for a think about the issue? Trouble is, thinking is something the current administration seems to have little time for. It\u2019s run by a mafia which much prefers PR guff, bluster and threats to the hard work of good governance and making a success of the nation.", "description": "The skills gap is a lead weight chained to the legs of the British economy.
