This week, a number of users noticed an influx of strange ads on the site, posting screenshots of spots for everything from dairy cow wellness to ministry insurance.\n\nThis is no rogue algorithm. Yesterday, the company confirmed that more ads are part of the platform\u2019s strategy going forward, telling CNBC, \u201cRecently, we\u2019ve shifted our approach to showing ads to everyone who uses Twitter and as a result, some will notice an increase in the number of ads they\u2019re seeing.\u201d The platform increased its ad load for users with \u201chigher follower counts\u201d to make the experience \u201cmore equitable,\u201d a spokesperson told Gizmodo, but the \u201chigh follower count\u201d threshold is unclear. (I only have a little over 1,500 followers but am now seeing ads every eighth tweet.)\n\nThe company\u2019s pursuit of a \u201cmore equitable\u201d spamverse isn\u2019t that surprising given that Twitter announced yesterday it had fallen short of expected third-quarter revenue, which resulted in a stock plunge of over 20 per cent. The platform blamed, in part, a \u201cbug\u201d that previously gave Twitter access to data users had never consented to share. Without that data, it\u2019s become more difficult for Twitter to deliver targeted ads and some advertisers have pulled spending, Bloomberg reports.\n\nYes! Constantly. This was the latest one I saved.

Maybe this has been your experience all along. If so, I\u2019m sorry, but for now, at least, I\u2019m delighted.\n\nUnlike Facebook and Google\u2014which have uncovered my latent desire for Kelly green, boatneck, mid-length sleeve t-shirts by microscopically dissecting my every move online\u2014Twitter offers a refreshingly ballistic overview of American capitalism. Twitter now dumps buckets of popcorn chicken on the table while wildly spraying soft drinks all over the room. It interrupts witty political quips by screaming: WOULD YOU LIKE SOME VELVEETA MAC N\u2019 CHEESE???? And then it vomits up a bucket of Heineken. Every moment on Twitter is #CrunchTime, baby, and maybe you\u2019d like some airline tickets and a tractor and a Chanel fragrance?\n\nIt\u2019s rowdy and obnoxious and drowning out the little intellectual cocktail party I\u2019ve cultivated over eight years on Twitter. But who doesn\u2019t want a break from staring at oneself as reflected back by targeted ads for linens and toilet paper? Not I.", "description": "If you, too, are suddenly seeing amazing offers for John Deere tractors all over Twitter, you\u2019re not alone.
