We pushed back very hard at all levels for the Turks not to commence this operation,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper told a news briefing.\n\nEsper and Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said they had spoken with their Turkish counterparts repeatedly in recent days, asking them to stop. But there was no sense that Turkey would do so, they said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not seeing any indication or warnings of any planned stoppage of their military activity,\u201d said Milley, the top U.S. military officer.\n\nShortly after Milley spoke, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan warned he would not stop his assault against Kurdish fighters no matter what anyone said. A war monitor said the death toll approached 100 from the first days of the assault, which began on Wednesday, including 17 civilians as well as dozens of Kurdish fighters and Turkish-backed Syrian rebels.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG is the main fighting element of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) which have acted as the principal allies of the United States in a campaign that recaptured territory held by the Islamic State group.\n\nThe SDF now holds most of the territory that once made up Islamic State\u2019s \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria, and has been keeping thousands of Islamic State fighters in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nReuters reported on Tuesday an initial pause in counter-Islamic State operations by America\u2019s Kurdish allies, who are redirecting their focus to the border.\n\nAlthough he acknowledged the Turkish assault was having an impact, Milley suggested some operations had continued, without elaborating. The United States this week moved two high-profile Islamic State prisoners being held by the Syrian forces out of Syria.\n\nMilley said he had just spoken with the chief of the Turkish General Staff, General Yasar Guler, who he said \u201cunderstands clearly\u201d that the prisoners would be Ankara\u2019s responsibility in the areas where it carries out the offensive.\n\n\u201cWe, the U.S. military, have no responsibility to ... secure those ISIS prisoners in Syria,\u201d Milley said. The Pentagon also stressed the need for Turkey to avoid doing anything to endanger U.S. forces inside Syria, which numbered about 1,000 prior to the incursion. Although U.S. troops had no intention of firing on Turkey, its North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, the Pentagon noted they had the right to defend themselves, if needed.\n\nMilley added that Turkey had been told of U.S. positions in Syria.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish military is fully aware - down to explicit grid coordinate detail - of the locations of U.S. forces,\u201d he added.\n\nEsper said he was repositioning additional troops around the region \u201cto assist with force protection as necessary.\u201d He did not elaborate.\n\nEsper also pushed back against criticism that the U.S. troop pullback was a tacit \u2018green light\u2019 to Turkey, portraying it instead as a decision taken to protect his forces.\n\n\u201cThis decision was made to ensure American troops were not caught up in the fighting between Turkish and Kurdish forces,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Pentagon strongly denied on Friday accusations that it had abandoned its Syrian Kurdish allies to a Turkish military onslaught, which it said was detribalising the region and doing \"dramatic harm\" to U.S.-Turkey relations.", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
