REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\n\nThe results for July through September represented a rebound from the previous quarter when Netflix lost U.S. streaming customers for the first time in eight years and missed targets for new subscribers overseas. Shares of Netflix rose 8.7% in after-hours trading on Wednesday.\n\nThat performance, combined with concerns about new competitors, had weighed on Netflix shares, which had fallen 21% from the last earnings report through regular trading on Wednesday.\n\nFrom July to August, Netflix was boosted by new seasons of shows such as \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d The company added 6.77 million paid customers around the globe, topping the nearly 6.7 million average expectation of analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nLooking ahead, the company projected it would pick up 7.6 million customers in the last three months of the year. Analysts had expected a forecast of 9.4 million. The company will release a new installment of \u201cThe Crown\u201d and Martin Scorsese film \u201cThe Irishman\u201d during that time.\n\nBut it will face new competition starting in November from Disney+, a streaming service stocked with movies and TV shows from Disney\u2019s beloved Marvel, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d animation and other properties.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) also will debut a much smaller streaming video service with original programming in November. AT&T Inc\u2019s (T.N) HBO Max, and a new offering from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), are expected to enter the market next year.\n\nNetflix argued that the new services would increase interest in the streaming video market broadly.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the likely outcome from the launch of these new services will be to accelerate the shift from linear TV to on demand consumption of entertainment,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to investors.\n\nFor the third quarter, Netflix\u2019s net income rose to $665 million (518.3 million pounds), or $1.47 per share, in the reported quarter from $403 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nTotal revenue rose to $5.25 billion from about $4 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.52 billion.", "description": "Netflix Inc added slightly more paying subscribers than Wall Street expected in the third quarter but issued a soft forecast on Wednesday as it faces new competition from Walt Disney Co and other big companies in the streaming video wars.", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441599795&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1V7", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
