As they attempted to capture the snake it regurgitated the animal in front of Neam\n\nThe snake in the video appears to be a reticulated python, which is the world's longest species of snake and can grow to more than 20ft.\n\nReticulated pythons are common in south and southeast Asia where they will eat almost anything they can kill, including mammals and birds.\n\nThey are ambush hunters, typically camouflaging themselves in undergrowth and waiting for prey to wander close.\n\nPythons strike quickly, using their serrated fangs to grip on to the prey before wrapping their bodies around the struggling animal and constricting it to death.\n\nLike many species of snake they are capable of distending their jaws, allowing them to swallow animals up to a quarter of their own length.\n\nThe prey is then slowly digested over the course of days or weeks, after which the snake may not need to feed again for months.", "description": "WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Neam Boonkerd, 70, from Thailand, found a 16ft python suffocating her pet dog Toob on Tuesday and attempted to save her beloved pet", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19593680-0-image-a-99_1570804815536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
