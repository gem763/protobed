Joni Ernst says that\u2019s only one of the scary wastes of taxpayer money by federal agencies looking to buy their way to a better image.\n\nShe was just as frightened this Halloween season by more than $250,000 the government has spent in recent years with a single Ohio-based costume company, in what the Iowa Republican calls the price of propaganda.\n\nIn a new memo Tuesday Ms. Ernst said the federal government spends $1.4 billion each year promoting itself. That\u2019s twice the amount spent on breast cancer research.\n\nAmong the mascots she wants to get the ax are Sunny Saguaro, a National Park Service cactus costume character who travels to parades and festivals. And Brite the Light Bulb, a U.S. Navy energy efficiency apostle. And the Green Reaper, an Energy Department mascot who even with a fear-mongering name and a rather scary visage is deployed to schools to encourage energy conservation.\n\n\u201cAs an Iowa State Cyclone fan, I\u2019ll be the first to say that mascots can be fun. But there is no justification for spending a quarter of a million dollars in taxpayer money on mascots and millions more on swag,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThese costs come at the expense of real national priorities.\u201d\n\nOther things taxpayers have shelled out for, in the name of Uncle Sam\u2019s self promotion, are coloring books ($605,000), key chains ($60,000) and drink koozies ($17,000). Another $25,000 went to buy give-away stress balls, and $16,000 for fidget spinners \u2014 2017\u2019s ridiculous summertime craze.\n\nMs. Ernst\u2019s bill, the Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government Act \u2014 or SWAG Act \u2014 would ban the use of taxpayers\u2019 money on creating or using a mascot for self-promotion.\n\nMilitary mascots would be exempt, which is probably a relief to Bill the Goat, the U.S. Naval Academy\u2019s man in a costume. Smokey the Bear and the Woodsy the Owl are also safe, since they are explicitly written into decades-old laws.\n\nBut the SWAG act would ban distribution of swaggy giveaways, right down to stickers, stuffed animals and writing pens.\n\nMs. Ernst \u2014 who won election five years ago with a famous ad recounting her youth castrating pigs on an Iowa farm, and her vow to bring those skills to Washington to make bureaucrats squeal \u2014 said not all PR spending is bad.\n\nNot only does the military need to promote itself for recruitment, but public health campaigns can warn of potential epidemics or safety risks.\n\nIt\u2019s the spending that appears to have little obvious value to the taxpayer, like a $30,000 NASA Martian-themed party, that irks her.\n\nThat NASA party featured a sci-fi costume contest.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
