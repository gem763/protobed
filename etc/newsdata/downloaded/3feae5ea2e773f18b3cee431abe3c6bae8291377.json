But we don\u2019t know yet whether this is contagious or just a series of individual cases,\u201d agency spokesman Ole-Herman Tronerud told public broadcaster NRK.\n\nThe majority of cases have been reported in and around the capital Oslo, but also in the cities of Bergen and Trondheim, and the northern Nordland municipality.\n\nThe Norwegian Veterinary Institute said Friday that it had detected two unspecified bacteria in autopsies, but was unable to clarify whether that was the cause of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cTo have healthy and great Norwegian dogs die so quickly is naturally serious. It\u2019s a very special situation I haven\u2019t been involved in before,\u201d the institute\u2019s emergency and safety director, Jorun Jarp, said Friday.\n\nIn neighboring Sweden, the National Veterinary Institute said it had been swamped with questions from dog owners concerned over the spread of the disease across the border.\n\nThe institute said it currently had no information \u201cto show that it is an infectious outbreak or that it would pose a risk to dogs in Sweden.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Norwegian authorities haven't been able to detect the cause behind an unexplained disease that is estimated to have killed dozens of dogs in the country in recent days, officials said Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jari Tanner"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
