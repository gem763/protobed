Children are explicitly targeted with sophisticated techniques,\u2019 it went on.\n\nDame Sally said weight-loss programmes and treatment were all being undermined by environments that promote unhealthy food.\n\nShe added: \u2018Politicians, I call on all of you across the political spectrum to come together and take action. The health of our children is in your hands.\u2019\n\nThe report, which was commissioned by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, also says 90,500 children may be eligible for weight-loss surgery yet only around 10 have it each year.\n\nWhat are some of Dame Sally's bold recommendations? Ban eating and drinking on public transport in a bid to curb children snacking. Extend the sugar tax to include sweetened milk-based drinks with added sugar. Ensure all publicly-funded sporting venues and major sporting events only advertise and sell low- calorie, low-fat and low-salt and/or sugar products. Tax food firms that fail to reduce sugar, fat and salt in their products quickly enough, and consider plain packaging (as for tobacco) for junk food. Impose a cap on the number of calories per serving at food outlets. Make free drinking water available in takeaways, food shops and restaurants. Phase out all marketing, advertising and sponsorship of less healthy food and drink products across all media, including online, at any major public venue or public-funded event, and on any public-sector-owned advertising site. Curb car speed limits near schools and homes to help improve air quality and encourage children to walk or cycle. Strengthen regulation of marketing of follow-on formula milk and improve promotion of breastfeeding, which is known to help reduce the risk of obesity. Introduce mandatory standards for the nutritional content of foods for children under the age of two.", "description": "Dame Sally Davies says we are currently \u2018nowhere near achieving\u2019 the government\u2019s ambition of halving childhood obesity by 2030, but added: \u2018If we are bold, we can achieve this goal.\u2019", "authors": ["Sam Corbishley"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89185318_1570658276.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
