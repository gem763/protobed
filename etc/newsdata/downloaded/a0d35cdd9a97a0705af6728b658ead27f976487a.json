Karen Bass, who represents a district adjacent to Buck\u2019s neighborhood, told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cEveryone knew that he preyed on young black men. ... The inaction in response had a message that was loud and clear: Black gay lives obviously didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nBuck, 65, is in custody, awaiting an arraignment that was scheduled to happen Wednesday but was postponed for unknown reasons. His attorney did not respond to requests for comment but has previously denied that his client was responsible for the overdoses.\n\nIn a request for high bail, prosecutors say otherwise.\n\nProsecutors described Buck as a \u201cmalevolent\u201d predator who used his money and power to lure vulnerable men facing drug addiction and homelessness to his West Hollywood apartment, where he allegedly indulged a dangerous fetish: injecting them with methamphetamine for porn-fueled sex marathons.\n\nTwo men died in Buck\u2019s apartment over the course of two years: Gemmel Moore, 26, in July 2017; and Timothy Dean, 55, in January 2019.\n\nMoore\u2019s family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Buck and county officials, presented officials with other men who said they were drugged, and loudly demanded that Buck be charged. They were disappointed that the charges unveiled Tuesday did not include homicide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed by how long it\u2019s taken,\u201d attorney Hussain Turk, who represents the family of one of the victims, told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s been two years. In that time, we\u2019ve presented nine witnesses who\u2019ve been forced to ingest drugs. The police did nothing with these reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason why we believe police did nothing with these reports is because of the races and sexual orientations of the victims: they\u2019re black, gay, homeless, and people who are the most vulnerable of our society. The police don\u2019t view them as valid witnesses.\u201d\n\nTurk said he believed that District Attorney Jackie Lacey brought charges against Buck this week because she had a public-relations disaster on her hands. Lacey\u2019s office declined to comment.\n\nIn the court filing, prosecutors said a man identified only as Joe Doe was drugged by Buck on Sept. 4 and fled to seek medical help. A week later, Buck allegedly gave him a double dose of meth and then tried to stop him from getting help before he managed to get out and call 911 from a gas station.\n\nOne of Buck\u2019s neighbors told The Daily Beast that she saw sheriff\u2019s deputies talking to a young black man outside Buck\u2019s apartment the afternoon of Sept. 11. They let him go, she said, and later returned looking for him.\n\n\u201cThey let him just walk away, which I thought was ridiculous: the man had band-aids all over his arm,\u201d said the neighbor, who asked that her name be withheld.\n\nPolice later asked the woman\u2014who had tried to run after the man\u2014if she knew where he went.\n\n\u201cThe police walked up and down the block looking for him,\u201d she said. \u201cClearly they\u2019d lost him. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d been let go in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office would not confirm that the man seen by the neighbor was the man who called 911.\n\nThe neighbor said the episode wasn\u2019t the first time she had been unsettled by goings-on at Buck\u2019s apartment. Over the summer, she said, she got a \u201cbad feeling\u201d when she saw a young man being buzzed into the home\u2014and called police.\n\n\u201cMy heart kind of dropped when I saw him,\u201d the neighbor said. \u201cI just felt nervous. I was walking my dogs and I went right back home and dialed 911.\u201d\n\nShe said police told her Buck was a private citizen and they couldn\u2019t send a police car to his house to check out the situation.\n\n\u201cI understood that, I really did, I know there are laws. But I was so frustrated I called them back three times just kind of pleading with them to please send a car by, just to drive past, but they didn\u2019t think that was a good idea.\u201d\n\nProsecutors now say that Buck was operating a drug den out of his apartment. And they say that when they searched it, they found evidence of what Moore\u2019s family and community activists have been saying all along: that he was a serial predator.\n\n\u201cThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department found hundreds of photos taken in Defendant Buck\u2019s residence, of men in compromising positions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is only a matter of time before another one of these vulnerable men dies of an overdose.\u201d", "description": "Now that Buck is in custody after the third overdose in his home, many want to know why he\u2019s not facing charges for the first two young black men to die.", "authors": ["Steven Blum"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568865770/190917-ed-buck-tease_o5ljhg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
