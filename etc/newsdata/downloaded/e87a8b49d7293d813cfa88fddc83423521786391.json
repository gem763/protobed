Fiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former senior adviser on Russia and Europe, appeared Monday under subpoena. George Kent, a senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy, testified Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the subpoena for Giuliani\u2019s documents, which Democrats issued two weeks ago, lawmakers asked for texts, emails and other documents dating to January 2017, including any information related to his efforts to persuade Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit Trump politically.\n\n\n\nLawmakers also requested documents from Giuliani that could reveal more about why $391 million in security aid for Ukraine was held up. Democrats have suggested that the president or his aides used the aid as leverage in the effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden and open other inquiries.\n\n\n\nGiuliani\u2019s decision not to produce the documents could leave him open to charges of contempt. Democrats could use it to further build an impeachment case against Trump, particularly on an obstruction charge.\n\n\u201cYour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena,\u201d the Democratic lawmakers wrote in the Sept. 30 subpoena of Giuliani, \u201cincluding at the direction or behest of the president or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Giuliani\u2019s letter to the committee Tuesday, Sale said lawmakers should consider it the \u201cformal notice\u201d that Giuliani will not cooperate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, repeatedly urged President Donald Trump to arrange for the deportation of a Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, calling him a violent extremist who needed to face justice in Turkey, former White House officials said Tuesday.
