We chatted with him about the bank's tech transformation, why now is the right time for him to step down, and what he's planning next.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Goldman Sachs surprised Wall Street on Tuesday by announcing the retirement of the longtime partner and technology evangelist Marty Chavez.\n\nChavez, most recently the cohead of the firm's securities division and the former chief financial officer, will stay on at Goldman until the end of the year. He'll then become a senior director.\n\nChavez joined Goldman's J. Aron commodities group in 1993 and left four years later, taking a turn at Credit Suisse and a spell as an entrepreneur. He rejoined Goldman in 2005, making partner the following year. He was named chief information officer in 2013 before taking on the CFO job in 2017.\n\nChavez has been thinking about his retirement for some time, taking counsel from friends and mentors, he said in an interview Tuesday afternoon. He's close to Harvey Schwartz, Goldman's former copresident. The idea was to find something that allowed him to stay true to a set of priorities that he's kept for years, which he listed in order: his own piece of mind, his children, and his job.\n\n\"It's just becoming more and more clear to me that to stay consistent with that list I needed a new project,\" Chavez said in an interview. The search eventually earned a name, \"Project Kids, Freedom and Sunshine,\" and culminated, or perhaps began, with the announcement. He's started a Google Docs list with retirement ideas.\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs is exploring plans to create a Netflix for data, and it marks a new frontier for Wall Street\n\nTo start, he plans to move to Los Angeles. Because he grew up in New Mexico, he always simply survived the East Coast winters, with the pull of finance forcing him to endure another winter. He harbored a plan to move to Southern California, though in the early years of his dream, LA didn't have much technology or finance scene. It was hard for Chavez to envision himself there. As the city has developed a tech scene, that's changed, he said.\n\n\"A galvanizing moment for me was in February, actually of last year,\" when Chavez was still CFO. \"I was at a gathering in Venice Beach and my friend Peter Thiel, who has a very direct and remarkable way of speaking, stopped me midsentence and said when are you going to stop talking about moving to LA and actually move to LA.\"\n\nOnce he gets there, Chavez said he planned to do nothing for some time. He's made just one commitment so far: agreeing to teach a class on software in finance next spring at Stanford's business school, he said.\n\nLong term, Chavez, who has degrees from Harvard in biochemistry and computer science and a Ph.D. in medical information sciences from Stanford, may try his hand at the burgeoning field of biotechnology. He's long been fascinated by the idea that DNA and organisms and living things might be programmable, much like making money and risk management has proven to be.\n\n\"That intersection of computation and life sciences is happening now,\" he said. \"We're talking about things like figuring out how the protein folds itself, doing that in software, and using that to accelerate drug discovery because you can just simulate it all in software and run the clinical trials. These ideas would've been considered crazy talk not so long ago, but they're all starting to happen. And I think that's incredibly exciting.\"\n\nHe may also advise some private-equity and venture-capital funds, he said, though nothing has been arranged beyond some preliminary conversations.\n\nRead more: 'It didn't seem like it was his forte': Goldman Sachs CFO Marty Chavez is shifting roles after an unconvincing 18-month tenure\n\nAs CFO last July, Chavez went to Solomon and suggested he give up the finance role in favor of becoming a cohead of Goldman's securities division, where he could help spur some of the technological changes he felt were needed. Since then, Goldman has thrown resources into developing its Marquee trading platform and green-lighted a multiyear $100 million plan to improve the infrastructure of the equities-trading unit.\n\n\"When I went to David last year, I saw with a clarity that I don't get everyday some very specific things that I could do and needed to be done in the securities division,\" he said. \"And David agreed with me.\"\n\nSo why did he decide to leave Goldman now?\n\nRead more: Goldman Sachs is going through a huge transformation under new CEO David Solomon. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nHe finally feels like the projects that he's passionate about - increasing the importance and stature of engineers inside Goldman, improving the technological ability of the firm's securities division, and getting needed funds dispersed for those and other projects - would be preserved and advanced under Solomon and a cohort of execs he's mentored and developed over the years.\n\nHe name-checked execs including Ezra Nahum, Adam Korn, Raj Mahajan, Ericka Leslie, and Sinead Strain, who he said were increasingly deciding Goldman's vision and simply looping him in. A couple years ago, it was much more of Chavez explaining his vision and asking them to execute it, he said.\n\nAnd as a partner for 13 years, Chavez also felt it was the right time to invoke an older Goldman custom and stand aside so that the next generation could have its time.\n\n\"David and John and Stephen have been incredible backers and allies of the securities division, specifically, and how securities division is evolving,\" Chavez said. \"And so I think if it had been hard to make these transformations and assessments happen, potentially I would have stayed longer. Because I don't give up.\"", "description": "Chavez, who has degrees from Harvard in biochemistry and computer science and a Ph.D. in medical information sciences from Stanford, may try his hand in biotechnology.", "authors": ["Dakin Campbell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/560be13d9dd7cc19008be104-1334-667.jpg"}
