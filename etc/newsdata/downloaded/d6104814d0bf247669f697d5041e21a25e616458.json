That message, revealed by a government whistleblower, has spawned the impeachment investigation by the House. Trump, who has defended his contact with Ukraine as \u201cperfect,\u201d went further in expanding his request to China, a communist world power that has much at stake in its relationship with the United States in an ongoing trade war.\n\nThe boldness of Trump\u2019s call Thursday also suggests he will continue to act as though requests for other countries to investigate potential opponents in the 2020 election are normal, even in the face of broad condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans. It\u2019s a tactic Trump has used successfully before, pushing questionable secret conversations into the open, helping to inoculate him against charges that he is engaged in nefarious action, cover-ups or obstruction of justice.\n\nTrump doubled down on his comments later Thursday, saying in a tweet: \u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence stepped in to defend Trump earlier in the day, saying Americans have a right to know about the wrongdoing the president alleges, despite no evidence to support wrongdoing by Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign chairman said Trump\u2019s assertions merely show he\u2019s afraid of facing Biden in next year\u2019s election. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, who has a leading role in Congress\u2019 impeachment inquiry, said Trump\u2019s comments suggest \u201che feels he can do anything with impunity.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appeal to China evoked his public call in 2016 for Russia to track down his then-rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 a move that was seen as an unprecedented appeal for foreign election interference. It is a violation of federal campaign finance law to solicit anything of value from a foreign government to help a campaign.\n\nIn the case of both Ukraine and China, Trump has made his allegations against Biden without evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe president and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have for days been raising suspicions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in China, leaning heavily on the writings of conservative author Peter Schweizer. On Monday, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called the allegation that Chinese government business gave Biden\u2019s son $1.5 billion \u201ctotally groundless.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s unprompted reference to China on Thursday came moments after he was asked about trade negotiations with the country.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of options on China, but if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe later alleged without evidence that China had a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d on trade with the U.S. because of the Bidens.\n\n\u201cYou know what they call that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey call that a payoff.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Arizona, Pence, whose aides had previously tried to distance from the impeachment drama, echoed Trump\u2019s call for investigation of the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position as vice president during the last administration,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s requests for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens, as well as Giuliani\u2019s conduct, are at the center of an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint that sparked the House Democratic impeachment inquiry last week.\n\nBiden campaign chairman Cedric Richmond dismissed Trump\u2019s assertions as a reflection of the president\u2019s concerns about facing Biden in a general election. \u201cThis president is scared, and he\u2019s acting out,\u201d the Louisiana congressman said.\n\nFederal Election Commission Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub responded to Trump\u2019s remarks, tweeting a reminder that it is a violation of campaign finance law for anyone to \u201csolicit accept or receive\u201d anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election. The agency polices campaign finance laws. But after a recent resignation, its board does not have enough commissioners to legally meet and take enforcement action.\n\nTrump himself has faced multiple allegations that he and his children have enriched themselves through his presidential candidacy and time in office, including spending by the U.S. and foreign governments at his properties. Trump has contended that his political life actually has cost him money, though he is the first major presidential candidate in modern history to refuse to release tax returns that would provide more detail.\n\nTrump has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, at the same time that his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Trump encouraged Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani, and also volunteered the assistance of Attorney General William Barr to investigate the Bidens.\n\nOn Thursday, House lawmakers heard testimony from the former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, whose conversations with Trump officials and Giuliani have made him a central figure in the Ukraine inquiry.\n\nAhead of the 2016 election, Trump publicly called on Russia to release Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails if they had obtained them by hacking _ which U.S. intelligence agencies later determined to be the case.\n\n\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said during a July 2016 press conference. He later claimed in written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller that he made the appeal to Russia \u201cin jest and sarcastically, as was apparent to any objective observer.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump on Thursday publicly encouraged China to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, snubbing his nose at an impeachment inquiry...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS636_19trum_ZG_20191003212840.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
