After the House voted to start an impeachment inquiry of Clinton in October 1998, a CBS News/New York Times poll found that 45% approved and 53% disapproved.\n\nBut with Trump, those numbers are reversed. In an average of polls taken since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal inquiry last week, 51% support an impeachment inquiry. A minority, 44%, are against it.\n\nWhen it comes to impeaching and removing Trump from office, the difference is even more dramatic. An average of polls taken since early last week shows that 46% support impeaching and removing Trump from office. That\u2019s about equal with the 45% who are against such an action.", "description": "", "authors": ["Harry Enten", "Cnn.Com Politics Trump-Impeachment-Polling"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
