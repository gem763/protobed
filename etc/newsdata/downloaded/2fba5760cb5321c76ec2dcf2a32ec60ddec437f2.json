Star reveals 'gobsmacking' twist", "language": "en", "text": "Tonight, Emmerdale fans will be treated to a spectacle and a half as Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) acts out every viewers frustration at sleazy Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter) as he kicks off his murderous revenge in a dramatic hour long episode which culminates with a terrifying boat explosion.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to farm hand Nate than a young chancer looking to get with an older woman \u2013 Jurell has confirmed that there is an almighty twist on the horizon and has teased that fans will be \u2018gobsmacked\u2019 when the truth comes to light tonight.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Star, he said: \u2018There are so many theories out there but when the audience see it they will be shocked. I found out about it when I was first cast and I was like: \u201cWow.\u201d I don\u2019t want to spoil it but it\u2019s a massive reveal.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s only one part of a massive episode which sees Cain trick Nate and Moira (Natalie J Robb) onto a boat before he then reveals to Nate that he knows about the affair. But as Cain prepares to kill his love rival, Jurell teases that his alter ego can give as good as he gets when it comes to fighting Cain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe smiled: \u2018It was like filming a movie. We had stunt coordinators helping us with the fight scenes, and of course there\u2019s an \u00adexplosion. Nate sees Cain as this old man, he doesn\u2019t know about his reputation as this village hard-man but even if he did he wouldn\u2019t care.\u2019\n\nLives will be left hanging in the balance as the disastrous consequences of the affair rock the main players to the core. And it\u2019s not just the blast that will have serious repercussions as the reveal of Nate\u2019s true identity seems set to trigger a whole new series of dramatic events.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Tuesday 22nd October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "You might not see this one coming.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91156228-e1571740073813_1571740734.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
