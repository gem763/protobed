Gorsuch said he and his colleagues sing happy birthday to each other, grill burgers at employee picnics and play practical jokes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Supreme Court I know,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials say the Supreme Court\u2019s justices rule unanimously in 40% of the 70 cases they hear in an October-to-May term.\n\nGorsuch says he is concerned about the deterioration of civic education. He said only about one-third of millennials think it\u2019s important to live in a democracy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The conventional wisdom that the court is split along partisan lines based on the political views of the president that appointed each justice is false, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/supreme_court_justice_civility_talk_37280_c0-125-2972-1857_s1770x1032.jpg?81f95119961502c381bd349cd9604a0f354a252b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
