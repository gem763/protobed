So all is well again with the U.S. economy, right?\n\nNot so fast.\n\nThe attempt by China and the Trump administration to de-escalate after a series of tit-for-tat tariffs certainly comes as welcome news. The president might delay some pending tariffs and China is offering similar concessions ahead of another round of crucial talks scheduled for October.\n\nThe willingness of both countries to step back has helped spur a rally in U.S. stock markets DJIA, +0.14% SPX, -0.07% after priced swooned in August.\n\nWhat\u2019s also given stocks a boost is the universal belief the Fed will reduce already low U.S. interest rates this week \u2014 just in case the trade fight with China escalates again. Lower rates might encourage more Americans to buy a new car or home or refinance a mortgage to lower their monthly payments.\n\nSee: MarketWatch Economic Calendar\n\nNot that consumers need lower interest rates to encourage them to spend. They\u2019re already doing that.\n\nRetail sales and consumer spending surged during the summer and aren\u2019t likely to fade much. Higher incomes and the lowest unemployment rate in a half-century have given Americans the confidence to keep spending even though trade tensions have caused key segments of the U.S. economy such as manufacturing to slow.\n\nRead: For the first time in 11 years, 80% of Americans in their prime are working\n\nAll of this is good news, of course, but investors have seen this movie before.\n\nThe U.S. and China appeared to make progress on trade talks several times in the past year, only to see repeated breakdowns that angered Trump and spurred him to raise tariffs. The dizzying back and forth has caused business to take a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\u201cThe tariffs and escalating tensions are weighing on capital investment and future hiring plans,\u201d said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo.\n\nRead: Inflation\u2019s slow burn coming to an end? CPI shows prices on the rise\n\nThe Fed, for its part, is uncharted territory. The central bank lacks the tools to limit the fallout from a full-blown trade war, and with money already cheap, it\u2019s hard to see how even lower rates get anxious business leaders to increase investment.\n\n\u201cSince so many of the risks to the U.S. economy are tangled up in messy politics, [Fed officials] have no better idea than you about what comes next,\u201d said economist Avery Shenfeld of CIBC World Markets.\n\nThat leaves consumers to keep doing the heavy lifting for the economy, but even they have their limits. Each time the trade dispute with China has flared up, stock prices and consumer confidence have suffered.\n\nRead: Retail sales get big lift from auto purchases as consumers drive economy forward\n\n\u201cThese is only so much the Fed can do,\u201d Bullard said. \u201cConsumers are still underpinning the economy.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. and China are trying to tone down trade tensions, the Federal Reserve is ready to cut interest rates and Americans are still spending plenty of...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR295_econom_ZG_20190913142955.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
