Callejon played the situation. Another description would be that he outright dived, and cheated.\n\nWhether it was thereafter a penalty is a more difficult debate.\n\nThat the referee actually saw it that way and gave it was just unfortunate, since it could have gone the other way. VAR can never remove that ambiguity. Some decisions will forever remain unchangingly subjective.\n\nIn that sense, it was just just rank bad luck that the penalty was given.\n\nThat was what decided this opening Champions League match, even if the dive itself was genuinely an extension of Napoli\u2019s overall sharpness.\n\nIt\u2019s far from the first time they\u2019ve caused Liverpool problems. That\u2019s been the case in all of their three meetings Champions League so far in the Klopp era. There is a suggestion that Ancelotti\u2019s specific tactics might just be suited to unsettling Liverpool\u2019s, which is why they\u2019ve won two of those meetings.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

So, maybe does the entire path of this team.\n\nAllison\u2019s save might have been irrelevant, forgotten in the way that Adrian\u2019s here largely will because it no longer meant the same thing.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t go a different way. They were borderline incidents, and it was that very knife-edge nature of them that actually helped Liverpool get a fuller sense of themselves as a team in the long term. They helped them become European champions, and not just in terms of actually getting through.\n\nThat was one of the more interesting elements of this defeat, even if it won\u2019t really have any influence on the season.\n\nLiverpool should still breeze through the group, and will of course be favourites to win the trophy again, but this was not really a display that suggested why. It felt more like one from the side when it was much earlier in development.\n\nYou could see the general shape was there, and the core idea, with Fabinho particularly executing it perfectly \u2013 but he was one of the few. Liverpool were just lacking a sharpness, and felt off in so many moments when it came right down to it. Be that finishing, attacking moves and occasional defensive play.\n\nHow else to explain Robertson\u2019s clumsiness, or Virgil van Dijk\u2019s rare error.\n\nIn short, they were quite short of the standards they set for themselves.\n\nIt was not the performance of European champions.\n\nThis of course isn\u2019t any cause for concern. It\u2019s just one of those games, decided by one of those moments.\n\nBut it did emphasise that we maybe have got a little too used to them being utterly brilliant. That\u2019s how good they\u2019ve been.\n\nThis reminded us that their mortal, and the very capriciousness of the game can be the killer.", "description": "The enthralling capriciousness of football.
