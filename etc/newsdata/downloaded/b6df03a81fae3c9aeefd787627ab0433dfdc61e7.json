After the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961, he said, \u201cThose sons of bitches with all the fruit salad just sat there, nodding, saying it would work.\u201d He was furious when it took hours for the army to deploy troops to deal with rioting at the University of Mississippi when the first black student was admitted. And in the closest brush with nuclear war ever\u2014the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014Kennedy repeatedly refused to strike at Soviet missile installations on the island.\n\nHis judgment may well have made the difference between war and peace. But the military and intelligence heavyweights saw it otherwise. \u201cThe greatest defeat in our history,\u201d Air Force Chief Curtis LeMay called it. Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson\u2014the ultimate \u201cwise man\u201d who had confidently assured JFK that the Soviets would not respond to a military strike in Cuba\u2014called the peaceful resolution of the crisis a matter of \u201cluck\u201d and later said, \u201cWe have to face the fact that the United States has no leader.\u201d And Allen Dulles, the longtime CIA chief cashiered by JFK after the Bay of Pigs, said in retirement: \u201cKennedy is weak, not a leader.\u201d\n\nKennedy, in turn, was sufficiently worried about his military advisers that he encouraged director John Frankenheimer to make a movie out of Seven Days in May, a novel about an attempted military coup, and even vacated the White House for a weekend to accommodate the movie\u2019s shooting schedule.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jeff Greenfield", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
