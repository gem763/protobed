It's bound to fail, this attempt, it's already obvious,\" he said.\n\nThe interview was aired on Sunday ahead of Putin's visit to Saudi Arabia on Oct. 14.\n\n(Reporting by Maria Kiselyova; Editing by Frances Kerry)", "description": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow is not blaming U.S. President Donald Trump for failing to improve U.S.-Russian relations, a pledge he had made during his election campaign, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with Arab broadcasters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
