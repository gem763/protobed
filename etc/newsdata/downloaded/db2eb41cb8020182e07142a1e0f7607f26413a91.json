The job cuts come after Schwab pushed further into financial advice with its $1.8 billion buy of USAA's brokerage and managed accounts.\n\nIn July, as Business Insider first reported, two key executives in investor services and marketing left Schwab as part of an organizational restructuring. The firm has not provided an update on that overhaul.\n\nRead more: Charles Schwab's retail head and marketing chief are out \u2014 and the firm's still figuring out what's next\n\nA spokeswoman for the firm, Mayura Hooper, declined to comment on personnel matters. Multiple requests for comment to Sorensen were not returned. His Charles Schwab biography page appears no longer active. He had published research as recently as Sept. 13.\n\nSorensen, who was based in Colorado, joined the firm in 2004, according to industry records, and was previously with AMG Guaranty Trust as a senior analyst. His commentary on the markets was frequently quoted in the financial press.\n\nThe company has plans to lay off around 600 staffers, or 3% of its current workforce, to help manage expenses and navigate a \"more challenging\" operating environment, according to a statement from Schwab on Monday. Its $1.8 billion acquisition of USAA's brokerage business is set to close next year, handing Schwab both brokerage and managed accounts.\n\nRead more: Rivals E-Trade and TD Ameritrade had CEO shakeups within weeks of each other. The departures come as competition ratchets up among e-brokers.\n\nThose 600 job cuts were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAn August rate cut from the Federal Reserve to already historically low US interest rates is also piling pressure on Schwab, which rakes in a portion of its revenue from interest earned on client cash that is sitting in sweep accounts.\n\nThe firm, based in San Francisco, oversaw some $3.7 trillion in client assets at the end of August. That's a 5% increase from the same time last year.\n\nThe lastest move and the wider job cuts also come on the heels of revelations of a pair of closures overseas.\n\nThe company is closing its Singapore and Australia offices, it had confirmed to Business Insider earlier this month. The firm's Singapore office is set to close at the end of this year, and its website is already informing investors of the change. The Australia office would no longer provide services as of Sept. 13.\n\nThe Singapore closure was first reported by Reuters and the news website finews.asia, and the Australian publication Financial Standard first reported the Australian closure. Half a dozen people were employed in the Singapore office, Reuters has reported, citing an unnamed source.\n\nThose offices are relatively small in terms of Schwab's overall business, but their shuttering marked a hasty retreat from locations where Schwab had only been active for a few years.\n\nCharles Schwab's former executive vice president of investor services, Terri Kallsen, had said on a call with investors in February that Schwab likely would not do much more expanding overseas, citing regulatory burdens. Kallsen was one of the pair of executive departures in July that were first reported by Business Insider.\n\nYou can contact this reporter at rungarino@businessinsider.com, or with secure communication methods available here.", "description": "The firm is slated to close its $1.8 billion buy of USAA's brokerage and managed accounts in 2020, and has come under pressure from lower rates.", "authors": ["Rebecca Ungarino"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d813fb02e22af5b5948547e-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
