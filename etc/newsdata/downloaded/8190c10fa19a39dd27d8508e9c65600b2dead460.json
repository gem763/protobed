The inquiry was initially sparked in response to a whistleblower complaint regarding a phone call between Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and Trump.\n\nThe phone call supposedly revealed that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate his 2020 presidential rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, based on unfounded corruption allegations.\n\nA CBS News Poll found that 55 per cent of Americans agree with the decision to begin the impeachment process against Trump - a further 70 per cent also believed his actions were improper or illegal.", "description": "A tweet posted by US President Donald Trump to mock Democratic rival Joe Biden has revived a viral meme of band Nickelback.
