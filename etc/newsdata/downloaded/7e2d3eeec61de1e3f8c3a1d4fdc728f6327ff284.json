REUTERS/Amit Dave/Files\n\nThe survey comes after official figures showed India\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 5.0% last quarter, its slowest in more than six years and significantly weaker than 5.7% in a Reuters poll.\n\nThe Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index INPMI=ECI, compiled by IHS Markit, declined to 51.4 in August from July\u2019s 52.5, its weakest since May 2018. However, it has remained above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for more than two years.\n\n\u201cAugust saw an undesirable combination of slowing economic growth and greater cost inflationary pressures in the Indian manufacturing industry,\u201d Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.\n\nA sub-index tracking overall demand hit its weakest in more than a year and foreign orders increased at their slowest pace in 16 months.\n\nInput costs rose at their quickest pace in nine months while the rate of increase in output prices was slower than in July, suggesting firms\u2019 profit margins were squeezed.\n\nWith inflation predicted to remain below the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s medium-term target of 4% for the rest of this year, the central bank is expected to ease further in October to boost a slowing economy. [RBI/INT]\n\n\u201cAnother worrying sign was the first drop in input buying for 15 months, which reflected a mixture of intentional reductions in stocks and shortages of available finance,\u201d De Lima said.\n\n\u201cUntil manufacturers are willing to loosen the purse strings, it\u2019s difficult to foresee a meaningful rebound in production growth on the horizon.\u201d\n\nAdding to the gloomy picture, tighter margins and demand growth easing meant firms barely increased headcount.\n\nHowever, firms remained upbeat about the coming 12 months. Expectations of future output rose to their highest level in more a year, the survey showed.", "description": "Expansion in India's manufacturing sector hit its slowest in 15 months in August as demand and output grew at their weakest pace in a year and cost pressures increased, a private sector survey showed on Monday.", "authors": ["Anisha Sheth", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425280675&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810CR"}
