And yet, at the same time, they do\n\nIn Italy, the Serie A table is always front-page news. On Saturday, Sunday and Monday, La Classifica appears on the cover of all the nation\u2019s major sports papers. This season is only three games old but readers want to see those numbers. And especially on a weekend when Juventus have been knocked off their perch.\n\nThe Bianconeri had occupied first place \u2013 or at least a share of it \u2013 for 552 consecutive days, dating back to March 2018. That sequence ended after they drew 0-0 away to Fiorentina, leaving room for Inter to overtake by extending their own perfect start with a 1-0 victory over Udinese.\n\nIt is far too soon for any of this to matter. And yet, at the same time, it does. Last season, Juventus led the league from the first weekend to the last, never giving their rivals the tiniest window for hope. They remain clear favourites to win a ninth straight Scudetto but at least this time someone else will get a turn to front-run.\n\nItalian football pundit sacked for racist on-air remarks about Romelu Lukaku Read more\n\nJuventus, furthermore, did look vulnerable on Saturday. This was Maurizio Sarri\u2019s first game in the dugout for his new club, after recovering from pneumonia, and it would prove to be a difficult debut. Fiorentina had the better of the play, taking 18 shots to the visitors\u2019 eight and earning 10 corners without giving up a single one.\n\nDouglas Costa\u2019s early injury hurt Juventus, and Miralem Pjanic also had to be withdrawn before half-time, but those factors alone could not excuse the ponderousness of the champions\u2019 play. Fiorentina were simply quicker to the ball. Theirs is the younger team, and the dynamism of Gaetano Castrovilli\u2019s emerging talent was to the fore in sweltering heat, but the defining image of this game was that of a 36-year-old Franck Rib\u00e9ry running down Cristiano Ronaldo after giving up a five-yard head-start.\n\nThe Frenchman had been just a step too slow to punish a mistake by Matthijs de Ligt in the 16th minute, when the defender miscued a backpass, sending the ball square along the edge of Juventus\u2019s six-yard box. Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny, having endured a near calamity of his own when he accidentally booted the ball into Federico Chiesa moments earlier, beat Rib\u00e9ry to it at the back post.\n\nSarri cited the temperature, early kick-off and tired legs from international duty as mitigating factors. Those excuses drew a response from Antonio Conte. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything,\u201d said the Inter manager, \u201cotherwise we would have to bring out the balance sheets and the look at the estates. Let\u2019s just say that someone needs to stay calm and serene because they are on the strong side.\u201d\n\nThose sounded like the first shots fired in what will no doubt develop into a season-long back-and-forth between men with a little shared history. Sarri replaced Conte as manager of Arezzo in 2006, only for the latter to be reappointed before the end of the campaign \u2013 returning with barbed remarks about the team\u2019s fitness. The favour was returned when Sarri succeeded Conte at Chelsea, expressing surprise at the lack of tactical organisation in the team.\n\nFor now, Conte is still being careful not to puff up his own club\u2019s prospects. The truth is that Inter look far from an all-conquering side despite having collected maximum points. They were grateful against Udinese to the hot-headedness of Rodrigo De Paul, sent off after 35 minutes for slapping Antonio Candreva.\n\nPremier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \ud83d\udd35\u26ab Inter come away with a 1-0 win against 10-man Udinese and Antonio Conte's team go top of Serie A! pic.twitter.com/uPPOhf092f\n\nWhat the Nerazzurri do have is an emerging star in Stefano Sensi, the 24-year-old midfielder signed from Sassuolo this summer. He had already grabbed his first goal for the club in the season-opening rout of Lecce, and it was his dazzling Veronica (a pirouette turn) that drew the foul for the penalty to seal Inter\u2019s victory over Cagliari. On Saturday he added a match-winner of his own.\n\nIt was a remarkable goal, Sensi beating Rodrigo Bec\u00e3o to a header despite giving up almost a foot in height to his marker. The delivery had come from Diego God\u00edn, advancing out of the back three to support the attack \u2013 another positive note for the manager, who had spoken during pre-game interviews about his desire for defenders to contribute to build-up play.\n\nSensi looks already like a classic Conte player: small in stature yet an enormous on-pitch presence, breaking the lines with his runs and committing furiously to winning back lost balls as well. He lined up in an advanced position, just behind the attack, at San Siro, yet only two players on the pitch had more touches. None had as many shots on target.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stefano Sensi (second left) is congratulated after opening the scoring. Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRomelu Lukaku had a quieter game, but that did not prevent one pundit, Luciano Passirani, from dropping some alarming racism into the public discourse when he suggested on local TV station Telelombardia that the only way to stop the striker was to give him 10 bananas. Further awfulness was to follow, with monkey noises aimed at Franck Kessie during Milan\u2019s win away to Verona.\n\nTelelombardia were at least quick to condemn and distance themselves from Passirani\u2019s remarks, with a show director stating that he would not be invited on again. Verona took a different approach, putting out a pair of tweets in which they questioned whether the abuse of Kessie, along with reported taunts of the Milan keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, had happened at all.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018buuu\u2019 for Kessie? The insults to Donnarumma? Maybe someone was dazed by the decibels of the Gialloblu support,\u201d read the tweets. \u201cWhat did we hear? Whistles, inevitable, for refereeing decisions that continue to leave people feeling very perplexed today, and then a lot of applause for our \u2018gladiators\u2019 at the end of the game. We will not fall into clich\u00e9s and old labels. Respect for Verona and the Veronese. #respect\u201d\n\nHellas Verona FC (@HellasVeronaFC) I \u2018buuu\u2019 a Kessie? Gli insulti a Donnarumma? Forse qualcuno \u00e8 rimasto frastornato dai decibel del tifo giallobl\u00f9. Cosa abbiamo sentito noi?\n\nUnlike the league standings, those chants did not make it on to Monday\u2019s front pages. Certain stories never change.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 A contrastingly beautiful scene outside the Sant\u2019Orsola hospital, with Bologna\u2019s players making a detour on their way home from beating Brescia to share the win with manager Sinisa Mihajlovic as he continues to receive treatment for leukemia. Bologna had been 2-0 down after 19 minutes, and then 3-1 down at half-time, but roared back to win 4-3 after Mihajlovic made tactical tweaks \u2013 and delivered a stern dressing down to his players \u2013 from his hospital room, relaying his instructions to his assistant Emilio De Leo. \u201cYou only come here to bust my balls when you win,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut on Wednesday we\u2019re still going to talk about your mistakes. You can come up to my room and we\u2019ll rewatch the games.\u201d For now, Bologna\u2019s seven points from three games are their best start to a Serie A season in 17 years.\n\n\u2022 A happy weekend for Duv\u00e1n Zapata, who scored a thunderous 95th-minute strike to set Atalanta off in top spirits for their Champions League debut. A less happy weekend for his cousin, Cristi\u00e1n, the Genoa defender who fouled him for the penalty that led to Atalanta\u2019s first goal and later got bamboozled by his relative in a one-on-one.\n\n\u2022 Henrikh Mkhitaryan marked his Roma debut with a goal, and Paulo Fonseca got his first win. Even Justin Kluivert got in on the act, finding the net in Serie A for just the second time since joining last summer.", "description": "It is far too soon for early-season standings to really matter.
