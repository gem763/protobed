Jack is on Twitter at @ jackbutler4815 .\n\nJack\u2019s Music Pick: The Electric Light Orchestra:\n\nWhat began as a dream of Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne to fuse modern pop songs with classical touches became a hit-making machine through the mid-to-late-1970s and early-1980s. Wood left after album number one, leaving the creative direction to Lynne alone. And direct he did! From the prog-rock stylings of ELO II to the full-on, sugar-sweet, pristine production on OUT OF THE BLUE, to the synth-driven concept album TIME, ELO managed to sell more than 50 million albums in little more than a decade. The music has been used endlessly in the past 20 years in movie trailers and commercials, keeping the band in the public view. Heck, we also make time to discuss Lynne\u2019s turn as \u201cproducer to the stars\u201d in the 80s and 90s. Rev up the technicolor spaceship and set your vocoder to \u201chigh\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s time to dive in to ELO!", "description": "Scot and Jeff discuss The Electric Light Orchestra with Jack Butler, host of Ricochet\u2019s\u00a0Young Americans\u00a0podcast and sidekick of\u00a0The Remnant\u00a0podcast.", "authors": ["Andrew C.
