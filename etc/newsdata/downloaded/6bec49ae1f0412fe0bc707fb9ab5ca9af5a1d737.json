One man is a 50-year-old company president who lives in Minato Ward, and the other is a 42-year-old man from Setagaya Ward who was the operations director of Cocomaru Theater in Kichijoji, which closed in September, Sankei Shimbun reported.\n\nAccording to police, Cocomaru Theater had gained a business permit from the Tokyo government for the first floor area of the theater, but had not been able to gain permission for the second floor, as it only has one emergency staircase and did not meet other safety requirements. The theater company continued to show movies on the second floor while reporting that the space was used as an eating area.\n\nUnder the Entertainment Facilities Act, businesses pertaining to movies, music and theatrical plays require a permit. The men have admitted showing movies in the second floor theater without a permit, despite receiving safety hazard warnings from the Tamafuchu Public Health Center. Criminal charges were filed against the theater company in May.\n\nPolice said the second floor movie theater had about 1,200 customers and took in 1.1 million yen during the period between December 2017 and February 2019.\n\n\u00a9 Japan Today", "description": "Police in Tokyo have sent papers to prosecutors on two men charged with violating the Entertainment Facilities Act by running a movie theater without a permit.
