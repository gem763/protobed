Officials also accused separatists of moving unused missiles into Russia after the incident.\n\nThe Ukrainian government released recordings it said were of Russian intelligence officers discussing the shooting down of a civilian airliner by rebels who may have mistaken it for a Ukrainian military plane.", "description": "An emergency worker hoses down a smouldering pile of wreckage and bodies, after a Malaysian passenger airliner was brought down in fields in eastern Ukraine.", "authors": ["Maxim Zmeyev"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ3niF_o49vTlCHJFvZaqCgMWaxenG_rzZceSJjSxWlSuBt8emrAfxGq4UyDiUf71tXTopDh6fBdSE4oQesZF11G-tmSgsSpRu_Nde3Rw3V_S"}
