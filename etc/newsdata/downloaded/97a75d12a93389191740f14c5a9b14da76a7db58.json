REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nAt airports around the world travellers scoured mobile phones or quizzed officials for travel updates as they waited in long queues beneath flight boards showing flights delayed or cancelled.\n\n\u201cNightmare, nightmare, stressed,\u201d said British holidaymaker Nick, as he awaited information at Palma airport on the Spanish island of Mallorca.\n\n\u201cNot what we wanted really before going home. But what can you do? Other people have lost their jobs, so we\u2019re not as bad (off) as some other people,\u201d he said, with two young children - an 18-month-old and 12-year-old - in tow.\n\nHe and his family had been due to fly back to the northeastern English city of Newcastle on Sunday evening but now hoped to fly to Manchester on Monday evening and then to travel the 240 km (150 miles) back to their home city by coach.\n\nScottish tourists hoping to fly back to Glasgow said they now expected to head to the central English city of Birmingham, 400 km (250 miles) away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very anxious because I have sore legs so I don\u2019t know how... I\u2019m going to get to Glasgow if they take us to Birmingham or somewhere else. So it\u2019s going to be very difficult and a long day and I\u2019m very tired,\u201d said one woman in a wheelchair.\n\nThe British government has pledged to get an estimated 150,000 stranded British holidaymakers home in the biggest such repatriation operation since World War Two, but that is no consolation for many others whose holiday plans lie in ruins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely gutted, we\u2019ve looked forward to this for a long time, had the wedding in July so it\u2019s been another couple of months waiting for this,\u201d said Simon, who had been due to go on honeymoon with his wife Polly from London\u2019s Gatwick Airport.\n\nHe said he felt very sorry for the staff at his local Thomas Cook travel agency who he said had been helpful.\n\n\u201cMust be awful for them as well, coming up to Christmas as well. Yeah, I feel very sorry for them... I wish the government had maybe stepped in... It could have been done I think, but there\u2019s nothing we can do now. Just have to go home and make the most of it.\u201d\n\nCONFUSION\n\nMany travellers complained of a lack of information.\n\n\u201cObviously the customer services you couldn\u2019t get a hold of. The travel company we were travelling with, you can\u2019t get a hold of them,\u201d said Steve Tarrant, who had planned to fly to Cancun, Mexico, from Manchester Airport.\n\n\u201cSo we just took it upon ourselves to book another flight,\u201d he said, at an extra cost of 1,200 pounds.\n\nBritish tourists stranded in Greece also complained of being left in limbo.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sign saying that Thomas Cook customers should get in touch with their agency, but you don\u2019t get through to anybody because it doesn\u2019t exist. So how can you do that?\u201d said David Midson, holidaying on the island of Corfu.\n\nEven if additional flights are being laid on, there is no news about airport transfers to get them there, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only got tomorrow to try and make plans to get to the airport,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I had brought a driving licence, because I can\u2019t get a taxi.\u201d\n\nHis wife Lianne said the couple had happily holidayed three times with Thomas Cook.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any issues with them before. You get your odd holiday wobbles anyway but nothing like this.\u201d", "description": "Holidaymakers stranded by the collapse of Thomas Cook , the world's oldest travel firm, desperately scrambled for information on Monday on how to get home, as Britain mounted its largest peacetime repatriation effort.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432917671&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0P0", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
