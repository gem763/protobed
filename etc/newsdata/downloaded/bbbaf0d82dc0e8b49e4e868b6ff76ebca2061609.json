So, you know. And I\u2019m not even sure that ABC apologized for that. But certainly, it was a terrible thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think ABC owes an apology,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump was referring to a story that ABC News ran on Sunday and Monday in which it claimed that t had obtained video footage showing the war in Syria. As Breitbart News noted:\n\nThe footage, which ABC News purported was of an attack on the border town of Tal Abyad, was aired Sunday on World News Tonight and Good Morning America on Monday morning. However, a comparison by Gizmodo shows the video was captured at Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Kentucky back in 2017.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported that the video footage had been tweeted by a Turkish politician from Erdogan\u2019s party, in celebration of Turkey\u2019s offensive. That footage remains on Twitter:\n\nABD\u2019N\u0130N YPG\u2019YE VERD\u0130\u011e\u0130 M\u00dcH\u0130MMATIN B\u0130R SEFERDE NE KADAR\u2019I \u0130MHA ED\u0130LM\u0130\u015eT\u0130R DERS\u0130N\u0130Z? pic.twitter.com/spDFTtS3qi \u2014 \u0130brahim Melih G\u00f6k\u00e7ek (@06melihgokcek) October 9, 2019\n\nHowever, the footage turn out to be from Kentucky:\n\nThe Examiner noted that ABC News had taken down its video stories, and issued a correction and apology, but that it had not done so on the air as of Tuesday.\n\nAt the press conference, Karl \u2014 the network\u2019s chief White House correspondent \u2014 continued, without acknowledging the president\u2019s criticism: \u201c[Senator] Lindsey Graham just said of your remarks that you made in the Oval Office that if you keep talking like that, \u201cthis will be disaster worse than Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq.\u201d\n\nTrump retorted that \u201cLindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years. \u2026 I want to get out of the Middle East.\u201d He said that Graham should focus on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, and ought to focus on the effort by the FBI and the intelligence agencies to monitor his campaign during the 2016 election. \u201cThe people of South Carolina don\u2019t want us to get into a war with Turkey \u2014 a NATO member \u2014 or with Syria. Let them fight their own wars.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou should get your accounts correct. You shouldn\u2019t be showing buildings blowing up in Kentucky and say[ing] it\u2019s Syria, because that really is fake news.\u201d\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
