The officer was then reportedly beaten by the crowd, and had a petrol bomb thrown at him, before he ran off for reinforcements.\n\nWhile the ban isn\u2019t due to come into effect until midnight (12 p.m. ET), protesters were already making plans online for protests to openly flout the law Saturday \u2014 including a demonstration in which marchers would don Halloween masks.\n\nHong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, desperate to bring an end to nearly four months of increasingly violent unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese city, invoked the ban Friday using colonial-era emergency powers not used for more than 50 years. She said she hoped the ban would be a deterrent to violent behavior by protesters.\n\n\u201cWe must stop the violence,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave the situation to get worse and worse.\u201d\n\nAmid escalating tensions between police and protesters, an officer shot an 18-year-old high school student point-blank in the chest Tuesday. The shooting, which narrowly missed the victim\u2019s heart, marked the first time a protester has been shot by live ammunition, and prompted fresh outrage from the public, which only grew when police exonerated the officer and charged the protester instead.\n\n\n\nREAD: Hong Kong cops shot him in the chest. Now this protester is charged with rioting\n\nThe new order bans protesters from wearing full or partial face coverings at public gatherings, whether authorized by the police or not. Violators face up to a year in jail and a fine of HK$25,000 ($3,190).\n\nPeople who need to wear masks for their work, or for religious or medical reasons, are exempt. The government\u2019s Security Secretary John Lee said police would be allowed to wear them as part of their protective gear, but said individual officers could be identified even if masked, if necessary, through other means.\n\nMany protesters in Hong Kong wear masks to remain anonymous, fearing criminal prosecution or other forms of persecution by China\u2019s powerful state security apparatus. Many also wear goggles and industrial respirators as protection against police tear gas.\n\nHong Kong justice chief Teresa Cheng said Friday that the government believed the new law would not impinge on protesters\u2019 civil rights, as they still had freedom to assemble if they took off their masks. Similar laws banning masks exist in other countries, including Australia, Canada, France and Germany.\n\n\n\nBut activists and rights groups condemned the move as a heavy handed measure that failed to take heed of protesters\u2019 legitimate concerns about their security, amid widespread complaints of police brutality.\n\n\u201cIt is thanks to the climate of fear Hong Kong authorities have created that protesters feel the need to wear masks in the first place,\u201d said Joshua Rosenzweig, Head of Amnesty International East Asia. A recent Amnesty investigation found that Hong Kong police were committing reckless and indiscriminate violence against pro-democracy protesters, including assaults in custody that amounted to torture.\n\nREAD: The brutality of Hong Kong cops is putting protesters in hospital\n\n\u201cThis ban is especially worrying in a context where protesters fear arbitrary arrest, surveillance, and the indiscriminate use of tear gas and other projectiles,\u201d he said.\n\nProminent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said that the government\u2019s invoking of emergency powers was the \u201creal danger,\u201d and marked the city\u2019s further slippage into becoming a police state.\n\nAnger at the government was on full display in the city\u2019s busy Central district, where protesters tore down and set fire to a prominent banner celebrating Tuesday\u2019s 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nWith many Hong Kongers expressing their intention to defy the ban \u2014 including veteran pro-democrat politician Emily Lau, who told VICE News \u201cI\u2019ll go out and wear one too\u201d \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s government is reportedly anticipating pushback. The city\u2019s pro-Beijing Sing Tao Daily newspaper reported that the government expected some protesters would not obey the law, but hoped that it may deter others.\n\n\n\nCover: People protest a government ban on face masks in Central on October 4, 2019 in Hong Kong, China.
