[Photo/IC]\n\nThe conflict in northeast Syria intensified on Monday as Syrian troops moved in to support a region held by Kurds that came under heavy assault by Turkey after the withdrawal of American forces. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump called for a cease-fire.\n\nVice-President Mike Pence said Trump had told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call on Monday to agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n\n\"The United States of America simply is not going to tolerate Turkey's invasion in Syria any further. We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table,\" Pence told reporters.\n\nThe Kurds, Washington's former allies, said they invited the Syrian government troops in to help fend off the assault by Turkey, launched last week after Trump moved US troops out.\n\nTrump also said on Monday he would stop negotiating with Turkey on a $100 billion trade deal and boost tariffs on the country's steel to 50 percent in response to the incursion.\n\n\"Turkey's military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peace, security and stability in the region,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nHe said an executive order would enable Washington to impose \"powerful additional sanctions\" on those who may be involved in serious human rights abuses, obstructing a cease-fire, preventing displaced persons from returning home and forcibly repatriating refugees.\n\n\"I am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey's economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\" Trump said. \"The order will authorize a broad range of consequences, including financial sanctions, the blocking of property and barring entry into the United States.\"\n\nEuropean Union nations expressed outrage Monday at Turkey's actions and joined France and Germany in banning arms sales to the NATO ally.\n\n\"There is a strong commitment by all members of the council to take the actions required to stop selling arms to Turkey,\" said Josep Borrell, the Spanish foreign minister.\n\nThe Syrian army deployment is seen as a victory for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally, Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swath of the country that had been beyond their grasp.\n\n\"The main thing is that the Turks act in a way that is proportionate with the situation and that their actions do not harm the most important thing \u2014 efforts to get a political settlement in Syria. That is the main thing for us,\" said Yuri Ushakov, a senior foreign policy adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nSyrian state media reported the army entered Manbij, a town near the Turkish border that had been controlled by a militia allied to US-backed Kurdish forces. Earlier it pushed into Tel Tamer, a town on the strategically important M4 highway that runs east-west around 30 km (19 miles) south of Turkey.\n\nState television later showed residents welcoming Syrian forces into the town of Ain Issa, which lies on another part of the highway, hundreds of miles away.\n\nAin Issa commands the northern approaches to Raqqa, former capital of the Islamic State \"caliphate\", which Kurdish fighters recaptured from the militants two years ago in a major victory by the US-led campaign.\n\nMuch of the M4 skirts the southern fringe of territory where Turkey aims to set up a \"safe zone\" inside Syria. Turkey said it had seized part of the highway. An official of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said clashes were ongoing.\n\nWashington announced on Sunday it was pulling out its force of 1,000 troops that had provided air support, ground assistance and training for Syrian Kurds against the Islamic State since 2014.\n\nTrump said US troops would remain at a small garrison at Tanf in southern Syria \"to continue to disrupt remnants\" of Islamic State.\n\nThousands of fighters from a Kurdish-led force have died since 2014 battling the Islamic State in partnership with the United States, a strategy the Trump administration had continued after inheriting it from the Obama administration.\n\n\"After the Americans abandoned the region and gave the green light for the Turkish attack, we were forced to explore another option, which is talks with Damascus and Moscow to find a way out and thwart these Turkish attacks,\" senior Kurdish official Badran Jia Kurd said. Jia Kurd described the new arrangement with Assad's forces as a \"preliminary military agreement\", and said political aspects would be discussed later.\n\nKurds are the largest ethnic minority in Syria, and made up between 5 and 10 percent of the Syrian population of 21 million in 2011, according to The New York Times.\n\nKurdish fighters began forging autonomous rule in northeast Syria early in the country's eight-year war, benefiting from diversions of Assad's military to fight rebels and militants elsewhere.\n\n\"Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\"\n\nAnkara says it aims to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia which it views as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish separatists in Turkey. A \"safe zone\" would be set up in Syria to resettle refugees, 3.6 million of whom are in Turkey.\n\n\"We are determined to continue the operation until the end, without paying attention to threats,\" Erdogan said in a speech in Azerbaijan. \"Our battle will continue until ultimate victory is achieved.\"\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry said 560 militants had been \"neutralized\" since the operation began. Earlier, Erdogan said 500 militants had been killed, 26 surrendered and 24 were wounded so far.\n\nThe US exit leaves Turkey and Russia, as well as Iran, Assad's main Middle East ally, as power brokers.\n\nThe fighting has raised Western concerns that the Kurds would be unable to keep thousands of Islamic State fighters in jail.\n\nThe region's Kurdish-led administration said 785 Islamic State-affiliated foreigners escaped a camp at Ain Issa over the weekend. The British-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing sources in the camp, said the number that escaped was smaller, around 100.\n\nReuters and The Associated Press contributed to this story.", "description": "The conflict in northeast Syria intensified on Monday as Syrian troops moved in to support a region held by Kurds that came under heavy assault by Turkey after the withdrawal of American forces.
