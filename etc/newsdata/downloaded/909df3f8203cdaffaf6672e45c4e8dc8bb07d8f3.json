We have seen a worrying development in Sweden with explosions and increased violence,\u201d Hekkerup said. \u201cWe have been monitoring this and decided to strengthen border protection against Sweden,\u201d he added.\n\nThe decision also comes after Swedish residents were implicated in two major criminal incidents earlier this year in Denmark, the most notable event being the bombing of the Tax Authority at \u00d8sterbro in Copenhagen in August that destroyed much of the facade of the office building.\n\nA 22-year-old man from the multicultural Swedish city of Malm\u00f6, which lies close to the border with Denmark, was later arrested in connection with the bombing. Last month, another suspect, again, a Swedish national, was arrested at Copenhagen airport.\n\nSweden: No Deportation for Migrant Who Sexually Assaulted 11 Women in Two Weeks https://t.co/C7MmuIg3fZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 1, 2019\n\nWhile explosions have risen across Sweden, Malm\u00f6 has been one of the focal points of explosions, with the city seeing three explosions within 24 hours in June.\n\nThe situation has become so dire in the city that last month police warned the public to be on guard for explosive devices. Police said people should pay special attention to suspicious objects when walking around alone at night.\n\nA report released earlier this year by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter compared a range of statistics and found that explosions had surged by up to 45 per cent across the country from January to July 2019 when compared to the same period in the previous year.\n\nSweden: Suspected Terrorist Migrant Previously Hailed as Successful Example of Integration https://t.co/tjDDmhfyo0 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 17, 2019", "description": "The Danish government has announced it will be enacting border controls with Sweden due to the rise of gang violence plaguing the country.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/rsz_GettyImages-503572502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
