It earlier reached an intraday low of R15.18 to the greenback after opening at R15.05/$.\n\nWichard Cilliers of TreasuryONE said in a note to Fin24 that reports that China would not accept a broad trade deal with the Trump administration had placed the yuan under pressure in offshore trade, which has had a knock-on effect on other emerging market currencies. Talks between US and China are set to resume on Thursday.\n\nAnnabel Bishop of Investec said the rand could again strengthen in the run-up to the Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming meeting on October 30, if risk aversion subsides. The local currency ended last week at R15.03/$, in part due to expectations that the US will cut its interest rates.\n\n", "description": "The local currency fell on news China may be reluctant to accept comprehensive trade deal with the Trump administration.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9209/eeaee63d4fb341bb9f0b5dfbe0aec3be.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
