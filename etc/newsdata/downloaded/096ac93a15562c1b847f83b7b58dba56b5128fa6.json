Revenue fell US$1.5 billion short of analyst estimates at US$6.3 billion. CEO Elon Musk said the firm is ramping up production at its new plant in Shanghai. The company\u2019s stock was up considerably in early afternoon trading. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The surprise profit reverses Wall Street\u2019s expectations of a quarterly loss, but this is also the first time since 2012 that Tesla\u2019s revenue has been lower than the previous year. Some major investors have pointed to the slowdown in revenue growth as a cause for concern. The billion-dollar question is whether the company will be able to maintain profitability while working to meet its ambitious annualized production rate of 500,000 vehicles by the end of the year. Progress at the firm\u2019s new Shanghai factory is the crucial variable here, and while Musk maintains the plant is operating ahead of schedule, a number of barriers to mass production remain. Those include obtaining a key manufacturing licence to sell China-made cars in the country and establishing a reliable supply chain.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
