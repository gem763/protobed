But the charges against Pennsylvania state Republican senator Michael Folmer look pretty disturbing. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania state attorney general John Shapiro announced that authorities \"found images of child pornography on the Republican senator's phone after executing a search warrant Tuesday inside his Lebanon, Pennsylvania, home,\" according to CNN.\n\n\"This defendant serves as a state Senator and was entrusted to honor and represent his community in the Pennsylvania Capitol,\" Shapiro said in a press release.\n\nFolmer was charged Tuesday with \"sexual abuse of children, possession of child pornography and criminal use of a communication facility.\"\n\nCNN reports that a Tumblr user -- a popular social media site where users can upload images and pictures -- reported to authorities that an account had added a graphic image of a child. This then led authorities to conduct an investigation, which led the government to the home of Sen. Folmer.\n\n\"I will continue to say it -- no one is above the law, no matter what position of power they hold,\" Shapiro added. \"I will continue to work to protect children and hold those who abuse them accountable.\"\n\nAccording to Talking Points Memo, Republicans Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati and Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman released a joint statement addressing the matter:", "description": ".09/18/2019 19:17:17PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/261/ba236663-8871-4bba-b6d4-ab4e74645ba0.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
