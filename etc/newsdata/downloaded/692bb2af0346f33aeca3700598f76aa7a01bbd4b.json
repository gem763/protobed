It took two years to prove her entitlement,\" Arjun said.\n\n\"This all had a direct impact on her health and wellbeing to reach what should have been clear from the start the right outcome.\n\n\"It is clear that the initial assessments require changing to avoid this sort of situation recurring.\u201d\n\nBut the case, however many mistakes were made along the way, does at least show they can be corrected.\n\n\u201cThe good news, however, is that Nicole\u2019s case shows how bad decisions can be challenged and overturned,\" Arjun said.\n\nThe DWP said they are spending \u00a355 billion - more than ever before - on benefits to support disabled people and those with health conditions.\n\nA DWP spokesman told Mirror Money: \u201cWe want people to get the full support they are entitled to and are improving the assessment process, gathering more information earlier to aid decision-making.\n\n\"Decisions are often revised because more evidence is provided at a later stage and of the 3.3million PIP decisions made, only 5% have been overturned at appeal.\u201d", "description": "Nicole De Rafael was stripped of her benefits in 2017 but it took her two years and legal support before the DWP admitted she should actually have the maximum allowance", "authors": ["James Andrews"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article20381472.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IMG_0637.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
