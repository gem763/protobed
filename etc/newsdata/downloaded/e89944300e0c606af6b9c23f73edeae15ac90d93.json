The water accumulates while the storm is still over the open ocean.\n\nWhen the hurricane closes in on land, its strong winds push that water toward the coast and up onto land, creating walls of water sometimes as high as 20 feet.\n\nMarcus Yam/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe danger to people inside houses on the coast is the deluge of water that can flood homes and overpower walls rapidly.\n\nWhen Hurricane Sandy hit New York and New Jersey in 2012, many homes filled quickly with water that reached levels of 8 to 9 feet.\n\nThe risks can be even greater if storm surge combines with high tide, creating a devastating, rapid rise in water levels.", "description": "Storm surge could reach 4 to 7 feet along the Georgia coast.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/dorian-6-ap-er-190902_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
