In October 2016, McGowan tweeted, \u201cBecause my ex sold our movie to my rapist for distribution #WhyWomenDontReport.\u201d It\u2019s not known whom McGowan was referring to, though she dated filmmaker Robert Rodriguez from 2006 to 2009, and their film Planet Terror was distributed by Weinstein in 2007.\n\nWhile McGowan refused to comment for the Times story, actress Ashley Judd\u2014a past contributor to The Daily Beast\u2014spoke to the Times on the record. Judd alleged that in the mid-\u201990s, while filming Kiss the Girls, she was summoned to Weinstein\u2019s hotel for a meeting. When she arrived at the hotel, she said, she was \u201csurprised\u201d to be ordered to his suite. According to the Times, Judd alleges Weinstein \u201cissued invitation after invitation,\u201d from a massage to a shoulder rub to watching him shower.\n\nRelated: Late-Night Comedy Shows Avoid Weinstein Allegations... For Now\n\n\u201cI said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,\u201d Judd told the Times. \u201cIt was all this bargaining, this coercive bargaining.\u201d (Weinstein has since threatened to sue the Times over what he calls its \u201creckless reporting\u201d and has taken a leave of absence.)\n\nA meeting with Harvey Weinstein is not easy for any actress to turn down. During his tenure as the co-chief of Miramax\u2014and then The Weinstein Company\u2014he became synonymous with elevating films and actors to Oscar glory via aggressive awards campaigns and has a particularly impressive track record in the actress categories. Holly Hunter, Anna Paquin, Dianne Wiest, Mira Sorvino, Juliette Binoche, Gwyneth Paltrow, Judi Dench, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweger, Cate Blanchett, Kate Winslet, Penelope Cruz, Meryl Streep, and Jennifer Lawrence have all won Oscars for Weinstein films, and many of the actresses showered praise on the film exec in their acceptance speeches. Scores of other actresses, meanwhile, have received career-launching nominations.\n\nIn the wake of the blockbuster Times expos\u00e9, The Daily Beast reached out to dozens of prominent actors, actresses, and filmmakers\u2014who both have and have not worked with Weinstein\u2014only to receive many replies of \u201cno comment\u201d and plenty of radio silence.\n\nOne of the only members of \u201cliberal\u201d Hollywood to speak out about the disturbing Weinstein allegations was Lena Dunham, who did so through Twitter:\n\nDunham\u2019s second tweet, referring to \u201cwhat we\u2019ve condoned,\u201d raises an important point about Hollywood\u2019s most glaring, hypocritical blind spot.\n\nFor as long as Hollywood has existed, the \u201ccasting couch\u201d\u2014wherein film executives and filmmakers prey on powerless ing\u00e9nues\u2014has been so familiar as to become hackneyed. In 2013, Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon shared her own story of sexual harassment with me.\n\n\u201cI remember I was newly married\u2014I got married at 20 to Chris Sarandon\u2014so I was 23, and I had a wardrobe fitting and we were at a motel in Texas filming. When I got out of the bathroom from changing, everyone had left, and the director basically told me to spend the night. I gave some really lame excuse for not doing it, because we were in the middle of nowhere, and he was furious at me for the rest of the film. And he was a married man and a very well-known director,\u201d she recalled.\n\nOver the years, film bigs ranging from legendary studio head David O. Selznick to Alfred Hitchcock have been accused of sexually assaulting young actresses. Only in the last decade or so\u2014fearing industry reprisals, no doubt\u2014have actresses begun to speak out, with Charlize Theron, Thandie Newton, Gwyneth Paltrow, Helen Mirren, Zoe Kazan, and others sharing stories of sexual harassment during auditions and on set.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a little odd that the audition was on a Saturday night at his house in Los Angeles, but I thought maybe that was normal,\u201d Theron recalled during a 2009 interview with OK! magazine. \u201cHe was in his Hugh Hefner pajamas\u2014I go inside and he\u2019s offering me a drink, and I\u2019m thinking, my God this acting stuff is very relaxed. But it soon becomes very clear what the situation was. I was like, \u2018Not going to happen! Got the wrong girl, buddy!'\u201d\n\nJust last year, Casey Affleck managed to weather a pair of years-old sexual-harassment allegations en route to a Best Actor Oscar, while Hollywood stars continue to line up to work for Woody Allen and defend exiled rapist Roman Polanski.\n\nIn 2009, more than 130 Hollywood heavyweights signed an online petition demanding that the decades-old statutory-rape conviction against Polanski be dropped. Two of the most high-profile signatories were Allen and Weinstein.\n\n\u201cWe are calling every filmmaker we can to help fix this terrible situation,\u201d Weinstein said at the time. (Polanski has faced three more rape allegations against teens since then.)\n\nPerhaps Marilyn Monroe, a frequent target of lecherous studio chiefs and filmmakers, said it best in her memoir, My Story: \u201cI met them all. Phoniness and failure were all over them. Some were vicious and crooked. But they were as near to the movies as you could get. So you sat with them, listening to their lies and schemes. And you saw Hollywood with their eyes\u2014an overcrowded brothel, a merry-go-round with beds for horses.\u201d", "description": "Several high-profile Hollywood figures flatly refused to comment on the allegations of serial sexual harassment and sexual assault against the influential movie mogul.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2558,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1507264104/171005-stern-weinstein-hollywood-silence-hero_kwcrm2", "published_at": "2017-10-06"}
