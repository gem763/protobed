Here were the main measures from the report, compared to Bloomberg-compiled consensus data:\n\n3Q GDP Annualized quarter-on-quarter: +1.9% vs. +1.6% expected and +2.0% in 2Q\n\n3Q Personal Consumption: +2.9% vs. +2.6% expected and +4.6% in 2Q\n\n3Q Core Personal Consumption Expenditures quarter-on-quarter: +2.2% vs. +2.2% expected and +1.9% in 2Q\n\nAlthough personal consumption moderated from the second quarter, its growth rate still topped consensus expectations for the latest reported period. The second quarter\u2019s 4.6% surge in consumer spending had been the fastest clip in four-and-a-half years. Consumer spending comprises more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.\n\nGovernment spending also helped buoy third-quarter GDP, contributing 0.35 percentage points to the headline measure. Separately, residential real estate grew 5.1% and added 0.18 percentage points, marking a positive contribution to GDP for the first time in two years as lower mortgage rates helped drive a broad recovery in the housing market.\n\nPeople walk along a main shopping street in Manhattan in New York City.

Ongoing geopolitical concerns have spurred business to shore up resources and curb new spending to prepare for a future downturn.\n\nNonresidential private investment turned negative for the first time since 2016 in the second quarter and contracted again during the third quarter, this time by 3.0%, or the most since the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\nWithin this, structures investment posted the steepest decline of 15.3%, with economists having anticipated that factors including weaker oil patch and factory spending would weigh on this measure.\n\n\u201cThe capex numbers were awful,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in an email Wednesday. \u201cInvestment in intellectual property strengthened, rising by a solid 6.6%, but it\u2019s less volatile than structures and equipment spending, which appear to have fallen victim to slower earnings growth and the uncertainty caused by the trade war.\u201d\n\nNet exports also served as a drag, pulling 0.08 percentage points from headline growth in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cIncoming data point to a moderating pace of GDP growth in the second half of the year,\u201d Sam Bullard, managing director and senior economist for Wells Fargo Securities, wrote in a note ahead of the release of the GDP report. \u201cAs the tailwinds from fiscal stimulus wane, trade policy uncertainty persists, and sluggish global demand continues, the pace of U.S. GDP growth should moderate over the coming quarters.\u201d\n\nThis trend had been reflected in the bulk of the latest economic data releases, with many of these serving as leading indicators for the eventual GDP print. September\u2019s manufacturing activity index report from the Institute for Supply Management showed a contraction in new orders, production and employment, and fell to the lowest level in a decade. Manufacturing comprises about 11% of domestic economic activity.\n\nSome transitory factors, including fewer shipments of Boeing (BA) aircraft and the 40-day United Auto Workers strike on General Motors (GM), also may have generated a drag on headline GDP, other economists pointed out.\n\nMeanwhile, the BEA\u2019s report also showed core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) grew at a 2.2% pace in the third-quarter, matching expectations. This measure serves as the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, with central bankers maintaining symmetrical 2% target \u2013 a level which has been elusive in recent quarters. The third-quarter\u2019s core PCE print represents the first time the measure hit or topped 2% since the second quarter of 2018.", "description": "The Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advance estimate of 3Q 2019 GDP Wednesday morning.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ocYJyrJEWtqKOtRTmwP7LQ--~B/aD0yMzI4O3c9NDE3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/403e6040-fa78-11e9-9ff9-fae05d646555", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
