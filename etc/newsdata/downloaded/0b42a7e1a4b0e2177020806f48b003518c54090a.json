Everyone thinks Lottie has got off the hook.\"\n\n(Image: BBC / Boundless)\n\n(Image: BBC/Boundless)\n\nThe source added: \"The comments are totally out of order and racist. Yet she has been let off with a slap on the wrist.\n\n\"There is a general feeling among those on the show that the BBC don't understand how offended people are - or just want it to go away.\n\n\"It feels like it has just been brushed under the carpet.\"\n\n(Image: BBC/Boundless)\n\nA spokesperson for the Beeb said at the time: \"While this happened on a private messenger service once filming had concluded, the BBC nevertheless still expects the candidates to behave appropriately.\n\n\"The production company have looked into the issue reported back, Lottie has been informed that her comments were wholly unacceptable and is in no doubt about our view on this.\"\n\nThe source went on to claim that the situation has been made worse by Lottie's refusal to apologise and insistence that Lubna was simply jealous.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC / Boundless)\n\n\"If she had admitted she made a mistake,\" the source said, \"Then people might have been able to forgive her and move on. This hasn't gone away.\"\n\nBoundless, who work with the BBC on the hit show's production, issued a statement reassuring fans that something's being done about the scandal.\n\nIt read: \"Appropriate action is being taken and is a matter between the production company and individual concerned.\"\n\nLottie herself hasn't been silent on the drama, telling the Press Association: \"Mu use of the word 'Gandhi' was misinterpreted, it was as candidates in the group chat had been quoting Gandhi previously.\"\n\nShe added: \"The comments were taken out of context, and I ask the public not to make judgement without knowing the full context.\n\n\"At the moment, I would like my focus to be on the show, and I'm not interested in negative media attention.\"", "description": "Contestants in the show have slammed the BBC's handling of the racism allegations surrounding controversial business hopeful Lottie Lion", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Bbc", "Boundless", "Bbc Boundless"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20746910.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_18942258-high_res-the-apprentice-2019-series-15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
