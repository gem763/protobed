(Courtesy of Christine Bader Debrecht)\n\nChristine Bader Debrecht\u2019s daughter bought a used 2018 Honda Civic with fewer than 5,000 miles on it in June. It was the first car the 19-year-old ever bought. The St. Peters, Mo., teen saved money from her grocery store job and a gift she received from her late grandmother to make her down payment.\n\nShe had no idea that an aerosol can of dry shampoo would destroy it.\n\nHer car now has a hole in the sunroof, and the middle console is blown off its hinges \u2014 all because she left a can of one of her go-to beauty products inside Wednesday.\n\nDebrecht said her daughter, whom she didn\u2019t want to name, is heartbroken about the car, which could end up being a major financial loss.\n\n\u201cMy daughter has been constantly on the go since she got her driver\u2019s license three years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has always kept a stash of beauty products with her in her car, and dry shampoo has been among them.\u201d\n\nMost dry shampoos consist of alcohol and cornstarch to absorb excess oil on the scalp and hair, according to Research and Markets. Some women swear by it, calling it a miracle product.\n\nBut all dry shampoos aren\u2019t created equally.\n\nDebrecht said the bottle that exploded was an Equate brand \u2014 Walmart\u2019s generic line of products. It was the first time her daughter had used it, but she added that there was also a Dove brand dry shampoo that didn\u2019t explode among the rubble.\n\nWalmart, the maker of Equate, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nA view of the damage to the roof of Debrecht\u2019s daughter's car. (Courtesy of Christine Bader Debrecht)\n\nMichelle Francl, a professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr College, took a look at the dry shampoo can in question. \u201cIt\u2019s got propane and butane in it, which are the same things that are in lighters,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two flammable ingredients are common in aerosol products. They act as propellants to release the product out of the can, Francl said. Hydrofluorocarbon 152a, which replaced the now-banned chlorofluorocarbons, is in there for its dispersal properties. The denatured alcohol, which simply carries the product, is also flammable, Francl said.\n\nDebrecht said she knew that chemicals were under pressure in aerosol cans, but she was shocked to see propane and butane on the list. She said she was also surprised to see hydrofluorocarbon 152a on the list, saying she didn\u2019t see it listed as the first ingredient when she compared the Equate can to other brands.\n\n\n\nDebrecht says the brand of dry shampoo that exploded in her daughter's car was Equate \u2014 Walmart's generic product line. (Courtesy of Christine Bader Debrecht)\n\n\u201cAt least if you are transporting butane or a propane tank you know it\u2019s dangerous and can take special safety precautions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was a seemingly innocent can of dry shampoo.\u201d\n\nThe Equate can had a warning that said the product is flammable and \u201cmay explode if heated.\u201d It also cautioned against leaving the can in sunlight and suggested that it be stored at temperatures below 120 degrees. It was about 90 degrees outside that day.\n\nFrancl theorizes that the temperature probably got too hot in Debrecht\u2019s daughter\u2019s car, causing the can to explode.\n\n\u201cI would not have wanted to be in the car when that happened,\u201d Francl said, adding that sharp flying parts of the can could\u2019ve been dangerous, in addition to the flammable items inside. \u201cIt\u2019s like a small explosive device.\u201d\n\nDebrecht said insurance has agreed to pay for damages as long as they don\u2019t exceed $15,000. If it\u2019s more, the vehicle will be totaled and they will end up owing a $1,000 deductible no matter what. She and her daughter are still waiting to hear back about the estimated damages.\n\n\u201cBut everyone has been grateful, as are her father and I, that she was not in or near the car when this happened,\u201d Debrecht said. \u201cInjuries from this could have been so severe.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA woman has been in a coma for weeks after using mercury-tainted skin cream\n\nThe do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of in-flight grooming\n\nYes, solid toothpaste is a thing and we tried it so you don\u2019t have to", "description": "A Missouri teen was ecstatic to purchase her first car.
