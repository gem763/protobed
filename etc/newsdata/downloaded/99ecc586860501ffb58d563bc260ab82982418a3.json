The White House did not immediately respond to a request for details.\n\nTrump\u2019s promise of more disclosure came amid scrutiny of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s stay last week at a Trump resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, and questions about why an Air Force crew stayed at one of his properties in Scotland.\n\nDemocrats are investigating taxpayer-funded government spending at Trump properties as part of its broader probe into his finances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give out my financial condition and you\u2019ll be extremely shocked that the numbers are many, many times what you think,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have somebody take a room overnight at a hotel.\u201d\n\nTrump files a lengthy report detailing his holdings with the Office of Government Ethics each year, but figures on the value of his assets, revenue taken in and how much he has borrowed are given in broad ranges. It\u2019s also not clear from the report who may be investing alongside him in his various properties.\n\nHis disclosure filed earlier this year showed he took in at least $453 million in revenue in 2018 and he owes at least $315 million to various banks.\n\nTrump broke with decades of precedent by refusing to disclose his tax return to the public before taking office. Trump handed over management responsibility of the Trump Organization to his two adult sons, but did not sell off his interest in his properties and put the proceeds into a blind trust. Several previous presidents put their holdings into a blind trust so they wouldn\u2019t exactly know what they owned and how public policy might impact their finances.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday promised to release a detailed financial report of his personal holdings to the public before the presidential election next...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ970_19trum_ZG_20190909184342.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
