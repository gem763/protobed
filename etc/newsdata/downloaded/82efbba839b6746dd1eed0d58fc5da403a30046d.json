There's also the Marriott Bonvoy Bold Credit Card, with no annual fee, and the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant\u2122 American Express\u00ae Card.\n\nThe Bonvoy Boundless just launched a new welcome bonus of 100,000 Marriott points after you spend $5,000 in the first three months. That's higher than the welcome offer on the Bonvoy Brilliant Amex.\n\nYou can use Marriott points at more than 7,000 hotels around the world.\n\nThe card also offers a free night award every year after your account anniversary, and offers complimentary Marriott Silver status.\n\nNo matter where you're headed, there's a good chance you can find a Marriott hotel at your destination. That's especially true now that Marriott and Starwood have combined their portfolios \u2014 there are more than 7,000 Marriott properties post-merger, so having Marriott points can come in handy for all sorts of travelers.\n\nIf you're looking to earn more Marriott points, this newly elevated offer for the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit Card could be worth it. You can now earn 100,000 points when you spend $5,000 on the card in the first three months.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nMarriott Bonvoy Boundless card details\n\nThe Bonvoy Boundless earns 6x points on Marriott purchases, and 2x points on everything else. Just for being a cardholder, you get Silver Marriott status, and you also get 15 elite night credits each year to help boost you to the next status level.\n\nThose benefits are all well and good, but it's the Boundless card's annual free night reward \u2014 which you can use at Marriott hotels that cost up to 35,000 points \u2014 that can really deliver significant value. Depending on where you use it, you could get more than $95 in value, in which case the card's annual fee pays for itself.\n\nThe Boundless is the middle-of-the-road option in the lineup of Marriott co-branded credit cards for non-business users. There's also the Marriott Bonvoy Bold, with no annual fee, and the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant from Amex, with a $450 annual fee and lots of premium perks. The Boundless is currently offering the highest welcome bonus of the three cards \u2014 the Bold is offering 50,000 points after you spend $2,000 in the first three months, while the Brilliant is offering 75,000 points after you spend $3,000 in the first three months.\n\nRead more: The best hotel credit cards\n\n100,000-point sign-up bonus\n\nThe Bonvoy Boundless is one of two Marriott co-branded credit cards currently offering a welcome bonus of 100,000 points. The other card is the Marriott Bonvoy Business\u2122 American Express\u00ae Card, which is also offering new cardholders 100,000 points after they spend $5,000 in the first three months. That card is a business credit card, though, with a $125 annual fee and 4x points on a few additional spending categories \u2014 and the 100,000-point offer is only available on the Bonvoy Business until October 23.\n\nThere's currently no end date for the 100,000-point offer on the Bonvoy Boundless card, but it is being marketed as limited-time, so don't wait too long if you're interested.\n\nWhile you can use Marriott points with airline partners, the main way to redeem them is for Marriott stays. Free nights cost 5,000 to 100,000 points depending on the hotel category (1-8) and whether you're staying during an off-peak, standard, or peak time.\n\nTravel website The Points Guy values Marriott points at 0.8 cents apiece, so the Bonvoy Boundless card's 100,000-point sign-up bonus would be worth $800. Of course, you could get more (or less) value out of the points depending on how you use them. Make sure you do the math to see if you're getting a good redemption \u2014 just divide a hotel's cash rate by the number of points you'd need to book the same room. If you're getting 0.8 cents or more per point, you're in good shape.", "description": "Marriott's Bonvoy Boundless credit card is now offering a 100,000-point welcome bonus.
