The two companies are stepping in because SpaceX is protesting a combined $2 billion award the US Air Force gave to Blue Origin, ULA, and Northrop Grumman last October to develop new rockets for the Air Force. SpaceX didn\u2019t receive any money at the time, and now the company wants to change that.\n\nThe awards were part of a coveted Air Force initiative known as the Launch Service Agreement program, aimed at developing new American-made rockets that can take military satellites into orbit. For decades, the Air Force has depended on the United Launch Alliance\u2019s Atlas V rocket, which is powered by the Russian RD-180. But in the wake of Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Department of Defense has been trying to eliminate its reliance on Russian rocket technology for national security missions.\n\nSpaceX is protesting a combined $2 billion award the US Air Force gave to Blue Origin, ULA, and Northrop Grumman\n\nIn October, the Air Force granted the United Launch Alliance $967 million to aid the company\u2019s development of a new rocket called Vulcan, and Northrop Grumman received more than $791 million for its new rocket the OmegA. Blue Origin also received $500 million to help develop its future rocket, New Glenn. Surprisingly, SpaceX\u2019s next-generation vehicle Starship was left out, as were the company\u2019s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.\n\nThe money for the LSA program is merely meant to help accelerate rocket development, and does not mean that these three companies are guaranteed to launch national security payloads in the years ahead. Eventually, the Air Force will pick two companies to launch all national security contracts awarded between fiscal year 2020 and 2024, which will include missions that launch up until 2027. In early May, the Air Force released a final request for proposals from rocket companies to compete for this initiative, known as Launch Services Procurement. All of the LSA awardees can apply, and so can SpaceX, since it\u2019s already certified to launch national security payloads.\n\nNow SpaceX is protesting the LSA awards eight months later, arguing that the company wants a fair chance in the next phase of the program. \u201cSpaceX respectfully disagrees with the Air Force\u2019s LSA award decision,\u201d a company spokesperson tells The Verge in a statement. \u201cWhile we support the Air Force moving forward with its Phase 2 acquisition strategy for national security space launches as currently planned, we are formally challenging the Air Force\u2019s LSA decision to ensure a level playing field for competition.\u201d This comes despite SpaceX CEO Elon Musk admitting that SpaceX\u2019s proposal for LSA had \u201cmissed the mark,\u201d according to a report from the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general.\n\nOriginally, SpaceX requested that its recent lawsuit be sealed, since it contains \u201cconfidential and proprietary information and source selection information not appropriate for release to the public.\u201d However, a redacted version of the lawsuit was posted publicly on Wednesday, in which SpaceX argues that \u201cthe Air Force wrongly awarded LSAs to a portfolio of three unproven rockets based on unstated metrics, unequal treatment under the procurement criteria, and opaque industrial planning.\u201d SpaceX claims that the Air Force determined the company had more strengths than ULA, but that SpaceX was deemed the \u201chighest risk\u201d option. Additionally, SpaceX says that the Air Force drastically underestimated how much ULA\u2019s rockets would cost.\n\nIn the suit, SpaceX\u2019s lawyers also pointed out that Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman are each developing components of ULA\u2019s Vulcan rocket system, and argued that giving awards to all three enhances ULA\u2019s already-strong position in the market. They also point out a more tangible argument against the arrangement, saying that if both winners share rocket components, they might also share problems with those rocket components, and any setback or failure could potentially ground the Air Force\u2019s satellites without a viable plan B.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s protest could affect Blue Origin\u2019s chances in the second phase of the Air Force program\n\nIn their motions filed to the United States Court of Federal Claims, both Blue Origin and United Launch Services, a subsidiary of ULA, argue that they should be able to intervene to protect their rights and interests as awardees. Blue Origin argues that \u201cSpaceX has challenged the government\u2019s conduct under the LSA transaction\u201d and that SpaceX\u2019s protest could affect Blue Origin\u2019s chances in the second phase of the program.\n\nBlue Origin has already expressed concern about the upcoming Air Force competition, arguing that the military should postpone making its final two selections until 2021. Blue Origin has claimed that picking winners now would give SpaceX and ULA an advantage as the current national security launch providers, and that ultimately more than two companies should be chosen. (It\u2019s worth noting that if Blue Origin isn\u2019t chosen as one of the final two, the company won\u2019t receive the rest of the money from its LSA award.)\n\nSpaceX has filed protests against the US government before, most notably in 2014 in order to protest a major national security launch contract given to ULA that SpaceX was not allowed to bid on. SpaceX also filed a complaint with the Government Accountability Office in February over a launch contract for a NASA mission called Lucy that also went to ULA. SpaceX ultimately dropped that protest.\n\nRead SpaceX\u2019s redacted lawsuit below.\n\nUpdate May 22nd, 3:50PM ET: This post was updated to include a statement from SpaceX and information from the company\u2019s redacted lawsuit.", "description": "Last week, SpaceX sued the US government over an unknown federal contract it didn\u2019t receive \u2014 and now the company\u2019s rivals Blue Origin and the United Launch Alliance want to intervene with the lawsuit.
