An additonal five people were arrested on Friday \u2013 four on public land outside the perimeter of Heathrow Airport, and one in the airport itself.\n\n\"Our policing plan is aimed at preventing criminal activity which poses a significant safety and security risk to the airport, and the thousands of passengers that will be using it,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor in a statement. \"In these circumstances, we believe these arrests to be a proportionate response to preventing criminal activity that could significantly impact on a major piece of national infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAll arrests were made \u201con suspicion of conspiracy to commit a public nuisance,\u201d according to the police statement.\n\nAmong those arrested were former Paralympian James Brown and Roger Hallam, a co-founder of the group Extinction Rebellion, a radical protest group that employs non-violent acts of civil disobedience to highlight the urgency of the climate crisis.\n\nThe activists made their plans public weeks ago informing the public, the police, and Heathrow of the details of their activities on their website and in meetings.\n\nThey said that they would \u201cadhere scrupulously to our total commitment to non-violence and passenger safety\u201d by using lightweight drones, flying them only 6ft above the ground, and flying them far from Heathrow\u2019s flightpaths. They said that they would \u201cpose no risk to aircraft.\u201d They hoped, however, to prompt Heathrow to ground planes according to their own by-laws around drones in the exclusion zone.\n\nPolice say that protesters who fly drones within the exclusion zone could face a life sentence in jail. But were also confident that the protesters wouldn\u2019t disrupt flights, telling passengers that they should come to the airport for scheduled flights as per usual.\n\nDespite the early arrests, the remaining activists began attempting to fly the drones at 3am on Friday morning, but couldn\u2019t get the drones to fly. They claimed that Heathrow had jammed the signal to prevent them operating.\n\nThank you to our brave pilots . There are more of us ready to. take their place .

That number is expected to almost double to 7.2 billion passengers in 2015 according to the International Air Transport Association.
