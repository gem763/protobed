This was submitted along with the report of the senate appropriations sub-committee on state and foreign operations.\n\nIn a sub-section titled \u201cHumanitarian Crisis in Kashmir\u201d, the report proposes that India should take steps to mitigate the situation in the territory. The proposal for inserting the text was made by Democrat senator from Maryland, Chris Van Hollen, and was unanimously supported by other members.\n\nThere is apparently a growing concern among US Congressmen and senators about continuing restrictions on mobile and internet communications in Kashmir Valley and the detention of politicians of the territory. The growing concern is demonstrated by the House sub-committee on Asia holding a hearing on Asia, which will focus on Kashmir, on October 22. The panel will hear from US state department officials, but also from human rights activists.\n\nThe house sub-committee chair, Brad Sherman, had announced that the hearing will focus on the Kashmir Valley, where many political activists have been arrested and daily life, the internet, and telephone communications have been interrupted\u201d. He also stated that the hearing would review the humanitarian situation in Kashmir and whether Kashmiris have adequate supplies of food, medicine, and other essentials.\n\nSherman noted in the press release that he had heard stories of difficulties from Americans from Kashmiri Valley and their fears for their loved ones.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "The report has called for an end to what it has described as a \u2018humanitarian crisis\u2019 and restrictions including the curbs on communication in IoK", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kashmir.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
