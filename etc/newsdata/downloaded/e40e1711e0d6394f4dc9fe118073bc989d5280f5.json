The bid resulted in Telstra being booted out of the issued NBN tender at the time.\n\n\"It is my view that over the last 10 years private sector competition between strong players such as Telstra, Optus, TPG and others was always going to build 100MB broadband access and speed to the majority of the population of Australia, in an ongoing competitive landscape and at no cost whatsoever to the taxpayer,\" Mullen said at the AGM on Tuesday.\n\n\"Governments could then have decided how much subsidy they were willing to provide the industry to extend this coverage to regional and rural areas where private sector economics were unattractive.\"\n\nMullen claimed the cost would have been \"a fraction of the cost\" of the NBN, but instead, the country has been lumped with a state-owned monopoly that is set to cost AU$50 billion.\n\n\"However we got here and Telstra too must bear part of the blame for this due to its recalcitrance in helping government at the time, whether we like it or not the NBN is here to stay,\" he said.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nRain fade on your parade: Why 5G use cases in business are still years away (TechRepublic)\n\nCurrently available mmWave 5G has limited practical use, while promises of low latency communication are neither presently available nor of practical use to business.\n\nWiFi 6 will face 5G competition\n\nThe emergence of two new wireless standards will cause IT decision-makers to think carefully.\n\nEurope warns 5G will increase attack paths for state actors\n\nIncreasing reliance on software will increase exposure, and countries will have increased risk from trusting a single vendor.\n\n5G phones account for less than 1% of sales in China\n\nAlthough most Chinese smartphone brands have launched 5G phones, their sales in China remain a very small portion due to high prices and limited network coverage.\n\nTelstra flags 3G switch off planned for 2024\n\nSpectrum to be shifted across to 5G services.", "description": "There is no science that proves ill health impacts from 4G or 5G, Telstra chair John Mullen has said.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/17/817dc9a8-2f27-4627-aecc-9f4e52b8b514/thumbnail/770x578/64902cba7f530991aff0a0eeaa0cc1c1/190516-01-5g-r4-huawei-1-1-antenna.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
