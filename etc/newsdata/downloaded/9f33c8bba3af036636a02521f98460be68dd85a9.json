They have even insisted on code names to protect their identities.\n\nI come to a remote farmhouse. I step out of my car and a huge dog runs towards me barking. Then I come face-to-face with a woman in a balaclava.\n\n\u201cYou must be Cathal? We've been expecting you\u2026 Would you like a cup of tea and some freshly made lemon drizzle cake?\u201d she asks.\n\nThis is my welcome into the secretive world of yarnbombing. At a farmhouse at the foot of the Mourne Mountains in County Down, I have finally met group member Purl 3 \u2013 clad in a balaclava she\u2019s knitted herself.\n\nThe guerrilla knitters, who leave their trademark colourful displays in public places, first came to my attention when I spotted knitted balaclavas hanging over monuments in Belfast to show support for jailed Russian feminist group Pussy Riot.\n\n\u201cWe started off just as a knitting group,\u201d explains Purl 1, as we tuck into our cake, \u201cbut then we decided to highlight a few local issues. We went out at night and yarnbombed the prom in Newcastle to help publicise the arts festival. After that it just took off.\n\n\u201cPeople really paid attention. So now we have plans to target the G8 summit and highlight environmental issues. The whole world\u2019s media will be there so it\u2019s a good opportunity.\u201d", "description": "With her face hidden by a balaclava, a member of a rather secretive organisation stands in the middle of a road in County Down.
