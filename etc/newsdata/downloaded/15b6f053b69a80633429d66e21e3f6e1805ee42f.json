It feels as though each 20-or-so-minute nugget contributed its own signature phrases and cult moments, which remain firmly embedded in pop culture nowadays.\n\nYet it is interesting to comb through those combined 4,720-ish minutes of television and separate the highs from the lows. Friends will surely always have a special place among the series that set the standards of the sitcom genre. That\u2019s why the show remains a relevant topic of discussion to this day, and why it has come under renewed scrutiny as some (including this writer) have attempted to dissect the way it broached topics such as gender, sexuality, women\u2019s rights, and body politics\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Others are, quite simply, funny in a laugh-out-loud, goofy way, fuelled by the kind of moments that explain why Friends is, for many, the televised equivalent of comfort food.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The best TV cliffhangers of all time 1/37 Breaking Bad \u2013 \"Gliding Over All\" (2012) Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass \u2013 a gift from Gale to Walter White. \u201cTo my other favorited WW. It's an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.\u201d And with that, as Hank realises Walt\u2019s true identity, the end of Heisenberg\u2019s empire begins. AMC 2/37 The Sopranos \u2013 \u201cMade In America\u201d (2007) The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It's a seemingly banal occasion \u2013 a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It\u2019s an ending that\u2019s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television \u2013 and a cliffhanger that\u2019ll never have a resolution. HBO 3/37 EastEnders \u2013 The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001) \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do \u2018cause you ain\u2019t my muvva\u201d / \u201cYES I AM!\u201d - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation\u2019s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn\u2019t Zoe\u2019s sister at all, but her mum. BBC 4/37 Game of Thrones \u2013 \"The Rains of Castamere\" (2013) Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn\u2019s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating. HBO 5/37 Dallas \u2013 \"A House Divided\" (1980) The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman\u2019s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months \u2013 the time between seasons \u2013 the whole world was asking \u201cWho shot JR?\u201d Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode \u201cWho Done It\u201d. CBS 6/37 The Simpsons \u2013 \"Who shot Mr Burns?\" (1995) Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series\u2019 best. FOX 7/37 Doctor Who \u2013 \"The Parting of the Ways\" (2005) Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible \u2013 especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt\u2019s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston\u2019s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: \u201cBefore I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what \u2013 so was I.\u201d Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation\u2019s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. \u201cSo, where was I? That\u2019s it \u2013 Barcelona.\u201d BBC 8/37 Breaking Bad \u2013 \"Full Measure\" (2010) Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White\u2019s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale \u2013 an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring. AMC 9/37 The West Wing \u2013 \u201cWhat Kind of Day Has it Been\u201d (2000) The West Wing\u2019s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: \u201cWho\u2019s been hit?\u201d NBC 10/37 Smallville \u2013 \u201cCovenant\u201d (2004) It wasn\u2019t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans\u2019 patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family\u2019s farm. \u201cYou shall be reborn,\u201d Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn\u2019t the alone one; the ending marked a radical turning point for the series. The WB 11/37 Twin Peaks \u2013 \u201cThe Last Evening\u201d (1990) Twin Peaks\u2019 season two finale \u2013 the mystery drama\u2019s last episode for 27 years \u2013 may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant. ABC 12/37 Buffy the Vampire Slayer \u2013 \"The Gift\" (2001) The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show\u2019s most shocking moments (and no, we\u2019re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy\u2019s tombstone, which reads: \u201cBeloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.\u201c The WB 13/37 True Blood - \"Plaisir d'Amour\" (2008) It's easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he's a shapeshifter. HBO 14/37 The Walking Dead \u2013 \"Last Day on Earth\" (2016) After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book\u2019s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan \u2013 in retaliation for the death of one of his gang \u2013 decides which one to kill by using \u201cEeny Meeny Mino Moe\u201d. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker. AMC 15/37 The Leftovers \u2013 \"Ten Thirteen\" (2015) Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof's HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world\u2019s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season's penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer \u2013 only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What\u2019s more is they\u2019re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season. HBO 16/37 Lost \u2013 \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d (2005) In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O\u2019Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast. ABC 17/37 Lost \u2013 \u201cTwo for the Road\u201d (2006) \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost\u2019s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets. ABC 18/37 Lost - 'Through the Looking Glass \u2013 Part 2\" Whether you love or hate Lost, there\u2019s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he\u2019d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines. 19/37 Line of Duty \u2013 Series four premiere (2018) The fourth series of Line of Duty didn\u2019t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer \u2013 Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) \u2013 sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz\u2019s eyes suddenly open. 20/37 Heroes \u2013 \u201dThe Butterfly Effect\u201d (2008) After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli \u2013 parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter \u2013 tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she\u2019s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: \u201cBut I am dear, I am.\u201d A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode. NBC 21/37 Grey\u2019s Anatomy \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s Zoomin\u2019 Who?\u201d (2005) After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along. ABC 22/37 Green Wing \u2013 \u201cEmergency\u201c (2004) Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term \u201ccliffhanger\u201d quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he\u2019d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 off a cliff. Channel 4 23/37 Dexter \u2013 \u201cThe Getaway\u201d (2009) A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita\u2019s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season. Showtime 24/37 Battlestar Galactica \u2013 \u201cKobol's Last Gleaming: Part 2\u201d (2005) When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar \u2013 a warship belonging to the enemy \u2013 crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show\u2019s main character. ABC 25/37 Babylon 5 \u2013 \u201cZ\u2019ha'dum\u201d (1996) Having been warned for two seasons that Z\u2019ha\u2019dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called \u201cZ\u2019ha\u2019dum\u201d. They weren\u2019t wrong. It ended with the show\u2019s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased \u201cZ minus 14 days\u201d and \u201cZ minus 7 days.\u201d PTEN 26/37 24 \u2013 \u201cDay 5: 10:00pm \u2013 11:00pm\u201d (2006) 24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one \u2013 arriving at the 16 episode mark \u2013 stands out for sparking what would be the show\u2019s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show\u2019s most memorable villain was born. FOX 27/37 Friends \u2013 \"The One with Ross\u2019s Wedding\" (1998) While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel\u2019s (Jennifer Aniston) \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fianc\u00e9 Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily\u2019s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: \u201cTake thee Rachel\u201d. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good. NBC 28/37 The X-Files \u2013 \"Anasazi\" (1995) \u201cI\u2019m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,\u201d says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder\u2019s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away? FOX 29/37 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \u2013 \"Fall\" (2016) \u201cIt certainly wasn't the ending I expected,\u201d Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. \u201cFitting but frustrating\u201d, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). \u201cMum\u201d, the daughter says, sitting in a park\u2019s bandstand. \u201cYeah\u201d, she replies. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle. Netflix 30/37 Star Trek: The Next Generation \u2013 \"Best of Both Worlds\" (1990) Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise\u2019s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard\u2019s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved \u2013 and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime. Paramount 31/37 The OC \u2013 \"The Dearly Beloved\" (2005) Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan\u2019s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things \u201conce and for all\u201d between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap\u2019s song \u201cHide and Seek\u201d \u2013 AKA the \u201cMmmmh, what you say?\u201d song \u2013 suddenly starts playing. It\u2019s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what\u2019s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time. Fox 32/37 The Office US \u2013 \"Casino Night\" (2006) Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode\u2019s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not). NBC 33/37 Alias \u2013 \"The Telling\" (2003) JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show\u2019s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d ABC 34/37 Spooks \u2013 \"Smoke and Mirrors\" (2003) The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission \u2013 to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated \u2013 we soon discover that everything\u2019s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many. BBC 35/37 Dragon Ball Z \u2013 Next time on Dragon Ball Z There\u2019s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with \u201cNext time on Dragon Ball Z\u201d, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode. Cartoon Network 36/37 Pushing Up Daisies \u2013 \u201cKerplunk\u201d (2009) Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters\u2019 story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts\u2019 doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she\u2019s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come \u2013 and they still want them desperately. 37/37 Sherlock \u2013 \"The Reichenbach Fall\" (2012) Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series \u2013 plus Martin Freeman\u2019s Watson \u2013 were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special. 1/37 Breaking Bad \u2013 \"Gliding Over All\" (2012) Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass \u2013 a gift from Gale to Walter White. \u201cTo my other favorited WW. It's an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.\u201d And with that, as Hank realises Walt\u2019s true identity, the end of Heisenberg\u2019s empire begins. AMC 2/37 The Sopranos \u2013 \u201cMade In America\u201d (2007) The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It's a seemingly banal occasion \u2013 a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It\u2019s an ending that\u2019s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television \u2013 and a cliffhanger that\u2019ll never have a resolution. HBO 3/37 EastEnders \u2013 The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001) \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do \u2018cause you ain\u2019t my muvva\u201d / \u201cYES I AM!\u201d - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation\u2019s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn\u2019t Zoe\u2019s sister at all, but her mum. BBC 4/37 Game of Thrones \u2013 \"The Rains of Castamere\" (2013) Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn\u2019s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating. HBO 5/37 Dallas \u2013 \"A House Divided\" (1980) The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman\u2019s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months \u2013 the time between seasons \u2013 the whole world was asking \u201cWho shot JR?\u201d Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode \u201cWho Done It\u201d. CBS 6/37 The Simpsons \u2013 \"Who shot Mr Burns?\" (1995) Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series\u2019 best. FOX 7/37 Doctor Who \u2013 \"The Parting of the Ways\" (2005) Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible \u2013 especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device.

That\u2019s it \u2013 Barcelona.\u201d BBC 8/37 Breaking Bad \u2013 \"Full Measure\" (2010) Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White\u2019s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale \u2013 an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring. AMC 9/37 The West Wing \u2013 \u201cWhat Kind of Day Has it Been\u201d (2000) The West Wing\u2019s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: \u201cWho\u2019s been hit?\u201d NBC 10/37 Smallville \u2013 \u201cCovenant\u201d (2004) It wasn\u2019t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans\u2019 patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family\u2019s farm. \u201cYou shall be reborn,\u201d Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn\u2019t the alone one; the ending marked a radical turning point for the series. The WB 11/37 Twin Peaks \u2013 \u201cThe Last Evening\u201d (1990) Twin Peaks\u2019 season two finale \u2013 the mystery drama\u2019s last episode for 27 years \u2013 may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant. ABC 12/37 Buffy the Vampire Slayer \u2013 \"The Gift\" (2001) The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show\u2019s most shocking moments (and no, we\u2019re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy\u2019s tombstone, which reads: \u201cBeloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.\u201c The WB 13/37 True Blood - \"Plaisir d'Amour\" (2008) It's easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he's a shapeshifter. HBO 14/37 The Walking Dead \u2013 \"Last Day on Earth\" (2016) After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book\u2019s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan \u2013 in retaliation for the death of one of his gang \u2013 decides which one to kill by using \u201cEeny Meeny Mino Moe\u201d. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker. AMC 15/37 The Leftovers \u2013 \"Ten Thirteen\" (2015) Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof's HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world\u2019s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season's penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer \u2013 only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What\u2019s more is they\u2019re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season. HBO 16/37 Lost \u2013 \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d (2005) In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O\u2019Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast. ABC 17/37 Lost \u2013 \u201cTwo for the Road\u201d (2006) \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost\u2019s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets. ABC 18/37 Lost - 'Through the Looking Glass \u2013 Part 2\" Whether you love or hate Lost, there\u2019s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he\u2019d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines. 19/37 Line of Duty \u2013 Series four premiere (2018) The fourth series of Line of Duty didn\u2019t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer \u2013 Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) \u2013 sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz\u2019s eyes suddenly open. 20/37 Heroes \u2013 \u201dThe Butterfly Effect\u201d (2008) After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli \u2013 parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter \u2013 tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she\u2019s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: \u201cBut I am dear, I am.\u201d A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode. NBC 21/37 Grey\u2019s Anatomy \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s Zoomin\u2019 Who?\u201d (2005) After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along. ABC 22/37 Green Wing \u2013 \u201cEmergency\u201c (2004) Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term \u201ccliffhanger\u201d quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he\u2019d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 off a cliff. Channel 4 23/37 Dexter \u2013 \u201cThe Getaway\u201d (2009) A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita\u2019s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season. Showtime 24/37 Battlestar Galactica \u2013 \u201cKobol's Last Gleaming: Part 2\u201d (2005) When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar \u2013 a warship belonging to the enemy \u2013 crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show\u2019s main character. ABC 25/37 Babylon 5 \u2013 \u201cZ\u2019ha'dum\u201d (1996) Having been warned for two seasons that Z\u2019ha\u2019dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called \u201cZ\u2019ha\u2019dum\u201d. They weren\u2019t wrong. It ended with the show\u2019s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased \u201cZ minus 14 days\u201d and \u201cZ minus 7 days.\u201d PTEN 26/37 24 \u2013 \u201cDay 5: 10:00pm \u2013 11:00pm\u201d (2006) 24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one \u2013 arriving at the 16 episode mark \u2013 stands out for sparking what would be the show\u2019s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show\u2019s most memorable villain was born. FOX 27/37 Friends \u2013 \"The One with Ross\u2019s Wedding\" (1998) While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel\u2019s (Jennifer Aniston) \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fianc\u00e9 Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily\u2019s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: \u201cTake thee Rachel\u201d. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good. NBC 28/37 The X-Files \u2013 \"Anasazi\" (1995) \u201cI\u2019m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,\u201d says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder\u2019s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away? FOX 29/37 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \u2013 \"Fall\" (2016) \u201cIt certainly wasn't the ending I expected,\u201d Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. \u201cFitting but frustrating\u201d, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). \u201cMum\u201d, the daughter says, sitting in a park\u2019s bandstand. \u201cYeah\u201d, she replies. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle. Netflix 30/37 Star Trek: The Next Generation \u2013 \"Best of Both Worlds\" (1990) Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise\u2019s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard\u2019s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved \u2013 and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime. Paramount 31/37 The OC \u2013 \"The Dearly Beloved\" (2005) Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan\u2019s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things \u201conce and for all\u201d between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap\u2019s song \u201cHide and Seek\u201d \u2013 AKA the \u201cMmmmh, what you say?\u201d song \u2013 suddenly starts playing. It\u2019s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what\u2019s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time. Fox 32/37 The Office US \u2013 \"Casino Night\" (2006) Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode\u2019s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not). NBC 33/37 Alias \u2013 \"The Telling\" (2003) JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show\u2019s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d ABC 34/37 Spooks \u2013 \"Smoke and Mirrors\" (2003) The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission \u2013 to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated \u2013 we soon discover that everything\u2019s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many. BBC 35/37 Dragon Ball Z \u2013 Next time on Dragon Ball Z There\u2019s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with \u201cNext time on Dragon Ball Z\u201d, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode. Cartoon Network 36/37 Pushing Up Daisies \u2013 \u201cKerplunk\u201d (2009) Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters\u2019 story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts\u2019 doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she\u2019s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come \u2013 and they still want them desperately. 37/37 Sherlock \u2013 \"The Reichenbach Fall\" (2012) Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series \u2013 plus Martin Freeman\u2019s Watson \u2013 were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.\n\nHere it is, then: a full ranking of all 236 episodes of Friends, from worst to best.\n\n236. The One with Chandler's Dad \u2013 Season seven, episode 22\n\nThe portrayal of Chandler\u2019s parent \u2013 many viewers are now convinced, in hindsight, that Chandler\u2019s \u201cdad\u201d was actually a transgender woman \u2013 was problematic throughout the show, and this episode is no exception.\n\n235. The One with the Giant Poking Device \u2013 Season three, episode eight\n\n\u201cUgly Naked Guy\u201d was one of the least funny \u2013 and most offensive \u2013 gimmicks employed by the sitcom. A large part of this episode revolves around it, so it\u2019s no surprise to see it tumbling towards the bottom of this ranking.\n\n234. The One with the Vows \u2013 Season seven, episode 21\n\nThere is nothing crucially wrong with this episode, except that it\u2019s made up almost entirely of flashbacks from previous instalments. Can you imagine tuning in, back when Friends was still airing weekly on network TV, only to be served what essentially amounts to a rerun? Boring.\n\n233. The One with the Ick Factor \u2013 Season one, episode 22\n\nMonica dates someone younger \u2013 whom she presumes to be a senior in college \u2013 only to discover he\u2019s actually a 17-year-old senior in high school. Icky indeed. It\u2019s just one of those episodes where the central joke doesn\u2019t land.\n\n232. The One with the Truth About London \u2013 Season seven, episode 16\n\nThis episode would have occupied the middle of this ranking if not for a brief sequence in which Phoebe wonders what would have happened if Monica and Joey had ended up together. In this alternative reality, a fat Joey struggles to bring his chair up to the table as he sits down to another epic dinner cooked by his partner. It\u2019s fat-shaming at its worst, and it\u2019s profoundly uncomfortable to watch.\n\n231. The One with the Metaphorical Tunnel \u2013 Season three, episode four\n\nAh yes, The One Where Ross Freaks Out Because His Son Wants To Play With a Barbie Doll. OK, Ross. The only redeeming quality is the end sequence in which a young Ross is seen dressed as his female alter ego, Bea, and hosting a tea party.\n\n230. The One with Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. \u2013 Season six, episode 20\n\nAnother flashback episode, this time pegged to Chandler\u2019s failure to relay important news to Joey regarding a possible TV show role.\n\n229. The One with the Rumor \u2013 Season eight, episode nine\n\nRachel Green\u2019s former classmate Will (played by Jennifer Aniston\u2019s then-husband Brad Pitt) wanted to make up an embarrassing rumour about her in high school, and apparently, the most humiliating option was to make Rachel supposedly intersex. This one doesn\u2019t really need to be explained, does it? Activists have spoken at length about the stigma and shame associated with being intersex. This is one example of how pop culture has contributed to those issues.\n\n228. The One with the Ballroom Dancing \u2013 Season four, episode four\n\nLook, the storyline in which Joey agrees to help Mr Treeger practice his ballroom dancing is, in part, rather cute \u2013 but it\u2019s ruined by the mockery he faces for it. \u201cHow goes the dancing? Gay yet?\u201d Monica asks him in one of those moments that will remind you that Friends hasn\u2019t always aged well.\n\n227. The One Where Nana Dies Twice \u2013 Season one, episode eight\n\nRoss visits his family as they prepare to say goodbye to his late grandmother, and discovers dozens of sweetener packets (which she loved to collect) tucked away in her bedroom closet. It's a very sweet moment so why, oh why, ruin it with an entire storyline about Chandler\u2019s sexuality and whether he gives off some kind of gay vibe\n\n226. The One with the Thumb \u2013 Season one, episode three\n\nIs it Phoebe\u2019s extremely unbelievable discovery of an entire human thumb in her can of soda, or is it the fact that the show was clearly still struggling to grasp its own identity when this one aired in 1994? Either way, something about this episode feels off.\n\n225. The One with the Male Nanny \u2013 Season nine, episode six\n\nAka The One Where Ross and Rachel Find the Absolute Perfect Nanny After a Difficult Search but Have to Let Him Go Because Ross Has Outdated Ideas About Masculinity.\n\n224. The One with the Inappropriate Sister \u2013 Season five, episode 10\n\nRemember that weird time Rachel dated a guy named Danny who had an uncomfortably close relationship with his sister? Yes, I had blacked it out too. That storyline seems plain weird, and the rest of the episode isn\u2019t compelling enough to make up for it.\n\n223. The One with Joey's Interview \u2013 Season eight, episode 19\n\nOh, great, another flashback episode. This time, it\u2019s pegged to Joey\u2019s interview with an entertainment reporter (a tricky exercise for Joey, who tends to put his foot in his mouth while speaking to the press).\n\n222. The One where Ross Dates a Student \u2013 Season six, episode 18\n\nAs the title would suggest, Ross, a university professor, starts dating a student \u2013 and his shocked when he learns that\u2019s not merely \u201cfrowned upon\u201d but plainly forbidden by the powers that be. Come on, Ross.\n\n221. The One where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad \u2013 Season six, episode 21\n\nWhen the aforementioned student\u2019s father (played rather brilliantly by Bruce Willis) finds out his daughter is dating an older man in a position of authority, he\u2019s none-too-pleased. Instead of accepting that fact, Ross enlists his own ex, Rachel, to talk him up to the student\u2019s father. Of course he does.\n\n220. The One with the Breast Milk \u2013 Season two, episode two\n\nWhen Ross finds out his ex-wife Carol\u2019s partner Susan has tasted Carol\u2019s breast milk, he wants to try it too. But this is Ross, so naturally he\u2019s torn between his rivalry with Susan and his aversion for said breast milk. Not to be overly critical of Ross, but this isn't his finest moment.\n\n219. The One with Monica's Boots \u2013 Season eight, episode 10\n\nMonica buys pricey boots and her husband Chandler (who is actually a few episodes away from quitting his job, thus putting financial pressure on his marriage) thinks they\u2019re too expensive. So Monica pledges to wear them forever, and when it turns out they hurt, she tries to hide it from him. I realise Friends is just a fun sitcom, but this episode is enough to make you question whether you'd ever like to have a joint account with anybody.\n\n218. The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey \u2013 Season five, episode 15\n\nFar be it from me to be the Debbie Downer here, but I don\u2019t find jokes about Joey\u2019s girlfriend hitting him particularly funny? Sure, the storyline is played for laughs, but something seems a bit tone-deaf here.\n\n217. The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister \u2013 Season three, episode 11\n\nLittle life tip: if you're going to fool around with your friend's sister, maybe remember which one it was? Looking at you, Chandler Bing lost in a sea of Joey's siblings.\n\n216. The One with Joey's Fridge \u2013 Season six, episode 19\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Ross\u2019s decision to date a student for a moment. In this episode, he gets so insecure when his girlfriend goes away for Spring Break (you know, as she should) that he follows her on her beach getaway. The sequence where David Schwimmer is seen dancing on what appears to be MTV Spring Break is almost funny enough to redeem it all. Almost.\n\n215. The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner \u2013 Season three, episode 14\n\nIn order to keep Rachel from attending a fashion seminar with her colleague Mark (who he's convinced is courting her), Ross decides to accompany her \u2013 except Ross doesn\u2019t care about fashion and is so uninterested he falls asleep. In the words of Joey: how Ross got three women to marry him, I\u2019ll never know.\n\n214. The One with Rachel's Assistant \u2013 Season seven, episode four\n\nLook, I gave Ross grief for dating his student, but I also wasn\u2019t particularly taken with Rachel\u2019s decision to hire her assistant Tag just because she thought he was cute (even though he was clearly under-qualified), turning down a perfectly fine applicant named Hilda in the process.\n\n213. The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs \u2013 Season seven, episode eight\n\nAfter a few episodes of lusting after Tag, Rachel finally kisses her assistant and starts a secret relationship with him. Again, I think Rachel \u2013 who worked so hard to carve herself a place in the corporate world and really loved her job! \u2013 deserved better than this narrative arc.\n\n212. The One with the Race Car Bed \u2013 Season three, episode seven\n\nUgh. When Rachel brings her boyfriend Ross to dinner with her own father, it turns out Dr Green isn\u2019t exactly fond of the palaeontologist. Both men, however, end up bonding over their mutual disdain of certain aspects of Rachel\u2019s lifestyle, such as her decision to consult a chiropractor. Women, am I right?\n\n211. The One That Could Have Been, Part One \u2013 Season six, episode 15\n\nFlashbacks in Friends are always uncomfortable to some extent, mainly owing to the portrayal of young Monica, played by Courteney Cox in a fat suit. This episode is no exception to the rule: in this alternative reality, Monica is a 30-year-old virgin, presumably owing to her body shape.\n\n210. The One That Could Have Been, Part Two \u2013 Season six, episode 16\n\nMore of the same. Part two one gets a slightly higher ranking than the first because the alternative-reality plot resolves to bring all six friends back to their actual situations on the show (meaning Rachel leaves her fianc\u00e9 Barry, Ross realises his wife is a lesbian, and Phoebe quits her job at Merrill Lynch). As for Chandler, he realises he is in love with Monica, making their storyline slightly more nuanced than the 30-year-old virgin trope.\n\n209. The One Where Underdog Gets Away \u2013 Season one, episode nine\n\nRoss is uncomfortable speaking to his unborn child, but gets over his initial reluctance once because his ex-wife\u2019s partner Susan does it. It\u2019s slightly amazing how many of Ross\u2019s actions in earlier seasons were motivated by his desire to compete with his ex\u2019s partner. Also, any episode featuring Ugly Naked Guy automatically loses points.\n\n208. The One in Barbados, Part One \u2013 Season nine, episode 23\n\nYou know there\u2019s something wrong with an episode when the most interesting one-liners revolve around Monica\u2019s hair and whether or not she\u2019s going to leave The Supremes (because the Barbados humidity made it poofy, get it?). This one also sets up the \u201cRachel and Joey try dating\u201d story arc, which never really seemed quite right.\n\n207. The One with Joey's Bag \u2013 Season five, episode 13\n\nEvery time Friends makes a joke about masculinity (Joey wears a shoulder bag! Surely he must be a woman!), an angel loses its wings.\n\n206. The One with Ross and Monica's Cousin \u2013 Season seven, episode 19\n\nI could have lived without watching almost the entire Friends cast oggle Denise Richards for the better part of an episode. Meanwhile, Joey\u2019s attempt to conceal the fact that he\u2019s circumcised (for a role in which he has a full-frontal nude scene) with Monica\u2019s help is one of the most bizarre storylines in the history of the show.\n\n205. The One Where Chandler Gets Caught \u2013 Season 10, episode 10\n\nSurely, Chandler must get caught doing something interesting, if his antics deserve to be turned into the episode\u2019s title? Well, no. He\u2019s consulting with a broker because he and Monica have decided to move away from the city to raise their children in the suburbs. Fair enough, but 1) the way they unexpectedly break the news to their friends feels like a bit of a betrayal, and 2) before their announcement, the episodes goes through a whole sequence of flashbacks commemorating Monica\u2019s life in her Manhattan apartment. By now, you know the rule when it comes to flashbacks.\n\n204. The One with the Apothecary Table \u2013 Season six, episode 11\n\nThis episode was just one major advertisement for Pottery Barn, the California-based home furnishing chain. Rachel loves Pottery Barn, Phoebe (the most anti-capitalist of all six friends) doesn\u2019t. Much product placement ensues. It's actually not a bad episode, but the Pottery Barn overload feels unsettling.\n\n203. The One with All the Thanksgivings \u2013 Season five, episode eight\n\nSo many aspects of this episode are insulting to Monica, it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. Over the course of 20 minutes, we are taken through the group\u2019s past Thanksgivings, including some in the Eighties when Monica was younger and fatter. Courteney Cox is back in her fat suit, and as is customary on Friends, young Monica is portrayed in a pathetic light \u2013 lusting after Chandler, who clearly thinks he\u2019s too good for her. When Monica overhears Chandler referring to her as Ross\u2019s \u201cfat sister\u201d, she stops overeating \u2013 instead of, you know, telling him off. The next year, she shows off her slimmer figure in front of him, fuelling the \u201cchanging yourself for a man is the ultimate act of revenge\u201d narrative. And after all that, she\u2019s the one who has to make amends in the present day for accidentally chopping off one of Chandler\u2019s toes back in the day (she dropped a knife). All I want to do is give young Monica a hug, recommend therapy sessions, and urge her to never, ever marry that jerk.\n\n202. The One in Barbados, Part Two \u2013 Season nine, episode 24\n\nThe jokes about Monica\u2019s hair \u2013 specifically, about the cornrow braids she gets after her hair frizzes in the Barbadian humidity \u2013 have not aged particularly well.\n\n201. The One with the Joke \u2013 Season six, episode 12\n\nNothing fundamentally wrong here, but this whole episode just seems forgettable. Ross and Chandler argue over who came up with a joke printed in Playboy. Rachel takes offence with Phoebe\u2019s claim that she\u2019s a pushover. Joey is fired from Central Perk, then re-hired. You could remove this episode from the season and everything would pretty remain much the same.\n\n200. The One with the Nap Partners \u2013 Season seven, episode six\n\nIf Ross and Joey like to nap together, let them! Life\u2019s too short to let a perfectly fine nap partner go to waste. Also, in this episode, Monica learns that Chandler once broke up with girlfriend because she had gained weight \u2013 and worries he\u2019s going to do the same to her. Monica, if this is ever a concern, dump him. Just dump him.\n\n199. The One with the Boob Job \u2013 Season nine, episode 16\n\nChandler thinks Monica is contemplating getting a breast augmentation and sets out to convince her that he finds her perfect the way she is \u2013 which leads Monica to believe that Chandler is worried about her body changing if she ever gets pregnant. Honestly, can you blame her for misreading this one?\n\n198. The One with Phoebe's Rats \u2013 Season nine, episode 12\n\nPhoebe and Mike take care of a litter of rats: OK. Joey is sad because he can\u2019t make a move on Rachel and Ross\u2019s \u201chot nanny\u201d Molly: pretty offensive, and frankly repetitive at this point. Ross getting heartbroken after Rachel kisses someone else: again, we\u2019ve been there so many times before.\n\n197. The One with the Invitation \u2013 Season four, episode 21\n\nDefinitely the most entertaining of all flashback episodes. In this one, Rachel has to decide whether or not she will attend Ross\u2019s wedding to Emily in London. She ends up planning not to go, claiming that she must stay to look after Phoebe (who is pregnant with triplets and cannot fly) but, as flashbacks of her relationship with Ross make clear, it\u2019s simply too painful for her to watch him marry someone else.\n\n196. The One with the Halloween Party \u2013 Season eight, episode six\n\nIt\u2019s Halloween, and Ross dresses up as Spudnik (a cross between the Sputnik satellites and a spud). This makes up for the slightly lacklustre central plot that sees him armwrestling with Chandler to\u2026 impress the women in the room?\n\n195. The One with All the Haste \u2013 Season four, episode 19\n\nRachel and Monica finally get back their apartment (which they had lost to Chandler and Joey a few episodes ago). Ross proposes to his girlfriend Emily on a whim, leaving Rachel secretly brokenhearted \u2013 and laying the ground work for the emotional rollercoaster of his disastrous London wedding.\n\n194. The One with Rachel's Big Kiss \u2013 Season seven, episode 20\n\nRachel insists she once kissed her former sorority sister named Melissa (and played brilliantly by Winona Ryder). Phoebe doesn\u2019t buy it, because she thinks Rachel is too \u201cvanilla\u201d to have kissed another woman. Joey, naturally, finds the whole thing very titillating. Ross, meanwhile, comments that \u201cthat makes two of my wives\u201d \u2013 because his former spouse Carol is a lesbian, get it? It\u2019s one of those episodes that hasn't really stood the test of time.\n\n193. The One with the Butt \u2013 Season one, episode six\n\nAt this stage of season one, Friends was still trying to figure out its own identity, and it shows. Joey hopes to get his big break in film (little does he know he\u2019s going to have to wait for several more seasons), Chandler can\u2019t cope with dating a woman who is also seeing other men, and Monica is a neat freak. The plot lines are a bit all over the place, and none is particularly satisfying.\n\n192. The One with the Secret Closet \u2013 Season eight, episode 14\n\nOK, here\u2019s the thing: most of Friends was at least pretty good, so we\u2019re getting to the part of the ranking where some episodes end up towards the bottom simply because they're not as great as the rest. Here, the only interesting story arc is Rachel\u2019s, who experiences Braxton Hicks contractions and relies on Joey\u2019s support \u2013 leading Ross to realise he wants to be more present in Rachel\u2019s life as she\u2019s expecting their child. Other than that, Monica makes sexual noises when Phoebe massages her, and she also has a secret messy closet.\n\n191. The One with the Football \u2013 Season three, episode nine\n\nWatching Ross and Monica compete for the Geller Cup (a made-up award from their childhood) is pretty cute. Watching Chandler and Joey compete for a woman, less so.\n\n190. The One with Chandler's Work Laugh \u2013 Season five, episode 12\n\nMonica gets mad at Chandler for... wanting his boss to like him? Ross dates Janice? What\u2019s going on here?\n\n189. The One with Rachel's Crush \u2013 Season four, episode 13\n\nI had forgotten how terrible Chandler was at relationships early on in the show. This time, he\u2019s mad because his girlfriend Kathy, an ACTOR, plays a prostitute in a play, which he finds too sexual. Then date an accountant and leave the poor woman alone?\n\n188. The One with the Evil Orthodontist \u2013 Season one, episode 20\n\nChandler desperately wants a woman to return his calls, then finds her needy when she finally comes to meet him in person. Joey tracks down a woman who was spying on the group from the opposite building. Rachel sleeps with her ex-fianc\u00e9 Barry before realising she was right to leave him at the altar. Again, I don\u2019t hate this episode with the fire of a thousand suns \u2013 it\u2019s just not as good as the rest.\n\n187. The One with Mrs Bing \u2013 Season one, episode 11\n\nPhoebe and Monica fight over\u2026 a man who has never met them and is now in a coma (by their own fault)? Ross makes out with\u2026 Chandler\u2019s mother? Everything about this episode is a bit odd.\n\n186. The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress \u2013 Season seven, episode 17\n\nMonica has to give up on her dream wedding dress so that she can book the band Chandler wants for their reception. Given everything that\u2019s happened over the course of the previous seasons, one might question whether Chandler is really worth it, but OK, fair enough. Surprisingly, the better part of this episode revolves around Ross and Joey\u2019s competition as they both decide to take the same woman out on two separate dates. Usually, I\u2019m not a fan of the \u201cwoman as a competition prize\u201d trope, but in this case, it\u2019s diverted in a way that feels truly funny. (Hint: Joey attempts to sabotage Ross\u2019s date, the two get into a screaming fight, the woman leaves, which those two don\u2019t even notice until she\u2019s gone and they\u2019re left to eat dinner together.)\n\n185. The One with the Bullies \u2013 Season two, episode 21\n\nRoss and Chandler realise that just because they\u2019re adults doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re done with playground bullies. Also, Phoebe goes to visit her biological father, with whom she doesn\u2019t have a relationship. After accidentally running over the family\u2019s dog, she finds out that her father has walked out on them too, but meets her half-brother Frank Jr \u2013 who, as we all know, will provide an interesting story arc for Phoebe in seasons to come.\n\n184. The One where Rachel Goes Back to Work \u2013 Season nine, episode 11\n\nLook, it\u2019s great that Friends tackled Rachel\u2019s fears that she\u2019s going to get unfairly pushed out of her job after going on maternity leave. But the man who fills in for her, Gavin, acts like a dismissive jerk for most of his on-screen time, and suddenly gets to emerge as a \u201creally nice\u201d guy just because he offers to babysit once? I don\u2019t think so, Gavin.\n\n183. The One with the Home Study \u2013 Season 10, episode seven\n\nChandler and Monica panic after realising that the social worker who\u2019s evaluating them as potential adoptive parents went on a date with Joey \u2013 and of course, he never called her back. Meanwhile, Rachel reveals to Ross that she\u2019s terrified of swings (yes, the playground equipment). It\u2019s all OK, but the episode never quite takes off.\n\n182. The One with the Screamer \u2013 Season three, episode 22\n\nRachel dates a man with anger issues. Joey\u2019s co-star and girlfriend has to leave for LA. Phoebe tries to reach the customer service for her broken phone. It\u2019s all pretty funny, but again, there are better episodes.\n\n181. The One with the Flashback \u2013 Season three, episode six\n\nThis is one of the nicer flashback episodes, mainly because it takes place not too long before the show\u2019s pilot, giving us a better idea of how we got here. We get to see Joey become Chandler\u2019s roommate and meet the rest of the group. It\u2019s slightly strange to see the Central Perk as a bar (before it was turned into the iconic coffee house), and the whole episode has a definite quirky vibe \u2013 but quirky's nice sometimes.\n\n180. The One with the Lottery \u2013 Season nine, episode 18\n\nThis one belongs at the heart of the \u201cnot bad, but there are far better episodes\u201d zone. The friends enter the lottery, and it\u2019s pretty much a given that they\u2019re not actually going to become millionaires \u2013 although what a plot twist that would be for the show\u2019s penultimate season.\n\n179. The One with the Fertility Test \u2013 Season nine, episode 21\n\nChandler and Monica go to a fertility clinic. Chandler makes many jokes about having to ejaculate in a cup. Meanwhile, Joey tries and fails to impress his girlfriend Charlie by memorising information about various artworks at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This episode is just fine. It\u2019s just not laugh-out-loud funny or surprisingly moving, which so many episodes of Friends were.\n\n178. The One with the Stain \u2013 Season eight, episode seven\n\nMonica hires a maid, becomes convinced that she is stealing her clothes and tries to peek at the maid\u2019s crotch to check on a potential tell-tale ink stain on a pair of jeans (which she thinks might be hers). Monica, are you OK?\n\n177. The One with the Monkey \u2013 Season one, episode 10\n\nPhoebe meets David (her scientist boyfriend and also the one that got away because he went to Minsk to work on a research project), Rachel hangs out with her awful crush Paolo (who also happens to embody the stereotype of the promiscuous, womanising Italian), Monica invites her own boyfriend, Fun Bobby, whose backstory is never truly explained, and Ross adopts his monkey, Marcel. In other words, it's season one, and things are a bit messy.\n\n176. The One with the Hypnosis Tape \u2013 Season three, episode 18\n\nMonica starts seeing a millionaire named Pete who takes her to Rome (yes, Italy\u2019s capital) on their first date. Phoebe\u2019s brother Frank marries his home economics teacher and Phoebe is, understandably, a bit surprised \u2013 but ultimately accepts their relationship. This would be an unexpected but interesting episode if not for the story arc that sees Chandler using a hypnosis tape to quit smoking \u2013 except naturally, the tape is for women and Chandler starts acting in a more and more feminine way. Any storyline that involves Chandler and masculinity loses points. Those are the rules.\n\n175. The One with the Boobies \u2013 Season one, episode 13\n\nChandler accidentally walks in on a topless Rachel, and this is a sitcom, so instead of apologising and moving on, Rachel embarks on a quest to get back at Chandler by walking him on him while he\u2019s naked \u2013 but ends up peeping on all the wrong people. Pretty cringey in real life, but funny in a work of fiction. Meanwhile, Joey struggles after finding out his father is having an affair, and Phoebe dates a psychiatrist.\n\n174. The One with Joey's Award \u2013 Season seven, episode 18\n\nMonica momentarily panics when she realises that being engaged to Chandler means she will never experience the thrill of a new relationship. It\u2019s a rather common trope, but refreshingly applied to a female character (men in fiction tend to have a monopoly on the fear of getting tied down to a single person for the rest of their lives). Meanwhile, Ross is involved in a pretty uncomfortable plot line in which several of his male students may or may not fake being in love with him, and may or may not fake being attracted to men, in order to improve their grades.\n\n173. The One with the Jam \u2013 Season three, episode three\n\nMonica tries to get over her break-up with Richard by making a lot of jam. Chandler, fool that he is, goes to Ross, of all people, for relationship advice. Oh, and Phoebe has a stalker.\n\n172. The One with the Ball \u2013 Season five, episode 21\n\nRoss and Joey (and, later, Monica) realise they\u2019ve been throwing a ball to each other for two hours without dropping it, and challenge themselves to keep the streak going for as long as possible. It\u2019s one of those episodes where a sitcom takes something that could realistically happen in real life and escalates it to over-the-top heights \u2013 and the result here is pretty funny.\n\n171. The One with the Dozen Lasagnes \u2013 Season one, episode 12\n\nAh, yes, The One where Rachel\u2019s Awful Boyfriend Paolo Stars Groping Everyone. An interesting idea, which would have been better conveyed if Paolo hadn\u2019t been an offensive, sleazy-Italian-man stereotype.\n\n170. The One with Rachel's Phone Number \u2013 Season nine, episode nine\n\nRoss, who at this point hasn\u2019t been in a relationship with Rachel since season three, takes a message from a man Rachel met at a bar. And then doesn\u2019t give her said message. It will come back to haunt him, and rightly so.\n\n169. The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion \u2013 Season three, episode 24\n\nThe whole \u201cMonica dates a millionaire\u201d plot was a bit bizarre \u2013 albeit not completely unrealistic for a sitcom set in New York, which gets regularly cited as one of the cities with the most millionaires in the world. It makes sense, then, that Monica\u2019s relationship with millionaire Pete ended on a weird note: Pete decides he wants to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion and, being the dogged entrepreneur that he is, won\u2019t stop until he succeeds, even if that means getting seriously harmed in several wrestling matches. Monica can\u2019t bear seeing him get injured and breaks up with him. Strange, but points for originality.\n\n168. The One with the Birthing Video \u2013 Season eight, episode 15\n\nRoss\u2019s girlfriend Mona is getting understandably frustrated after he lies to her about Rachel (who at this point in the series is pregnant with his child) moving in with him. His efforts to somehow straddle his relationship with Mona and his involvement in Rachel\u2019s life have disastrous, yet hilarious results.\n\n167. The One After the Superbowl, Part One \u2013 Season two, episode 12\n\nBrooke Shields is amazing as Joey\u2019s stalkerish fan Erika, who is unable to make a distinction between Joey and his character on Days of Our Lives, Dr Drake Ramoray. Plus, Ross\u2019s quest to find his former pet Marcel, who has disappeared from the zoo Ross gave him up to, is actually quite funny.\n\n166. The One Where Joey Tells Rachel \u2013 Season eight, episode 16\n\nThe Rachel-and-Joey plot overall felt like a misfire, especially once these two actually got together, but still \u2013 Joey\u2019s feelings for Rachel made for a nice bit of character development on his part. Sweet, conflicted Joey was much more interesting than season 10 Joey, who somehow grew from a goofy airhead to an actual idiot towards the end.\n\n165. The One Where Monica Sings \u2013 Season nine, episode 13\n\nRoss brings a very nosy woman home, one thing leads to the next, and he and Rachel (who at this point are relatively new parents to Emma) realise they can\u2019t keep living together. It was always pretty interesting to watch Ross and Rachel try to function as co-parents, and the show approached that storyline in a way that often felt honest and as realistic as possible in the land of sitcoms.\n\n164. The One Where No One Proposes \u2013 Season nine, episode one\n\nRachel is trying to learn how to breastfeed her newborn daughter. She thinks Joey proposed to her but in fact he was just picking up the engagement ring that Ross was potentially, maybe going to consider giving her. Chandler and Monica are trying to conceive. That\u2019s a lot to pack in a 20-minute episode, but somehow it works.\n\n163. The One with the Cake \u2013 Season 10, episode four\n\nIt\u2019s Emma\u2019s first birthday, and everything goes wrong. None of Ross and Rachel\u2019s friends want to celebrate (how kind of you, guys), Emma keeps napping, and her cake, which was supposed to be shaped like a bunny, ends up being modelled after male genitalia. Eventually, though, those issues get solved, and the sweet resolution feels earned.\n\n162. The One with the Ring \u2013 Season six, episode 23\n\nPhoebe helps Chandler pick an engagement ring for Monica, and she\u2019s arguably the worst person for the job, which is what makes this episode so funny. Meanwhile, Rachel\u2019s boyfriend Paul (aka Bruce Willis) starts showing more emotional vulnerability, only to end up shedding an endless stream of tears.\n\n161. The One with the Soap Opera Party \u2013 Season nine, episode 20\n\nThis episode marks the arrival of Charlie Wheeler, aka Aisha Tyler, aka the first person of colour to become a regular cast member on Friends. Hurrah! But yes, it took the show nine seasons and practically a decade to get to that point. And even then, Charlie only remained for nine episodes.\n\n160. The One with the Cooking Class \u2013 Season eight, episode 21\n\nJennifer Aniston delivers a pretty amazing (funny and yet touching) performance as a pregnant Rachel who doesn\u2019t want Ross to date anyone (but doesn't want to date him, either). Oh, and Monica, a professional chef, goes to a cooking class to heal her bruised ego after her restaurant gets a searing review.\n\n159. The One Where Rachel Finds Out \u2013 Season one, episode 24\n\nJoey can\u2019t have sex because he\u2019s participating in a research study for which he needs to donate sperm, so he decides to focus on his partner\u2019s pleasure exclusively. Imagine that! Of course, this only lasts as long as the study goes on.\n\n158. The One with Ross's Library Book \u2013 Season seven, episode seven\n\nRoss tries to prevent people from fooling around among the library stacks where his thesis is kept, while Rachel and Phoebe grow attached to a woman who was supposed to be Joey\u2019s one-night-stand. And how nice is it to see Sex And the City\u2019s Kristin Davis cross over into the Friends realm?\n\n157. The One Where the Monkey Gets Away \u2013 Season one, episode 19\n\nRachel lets Ross\u2019s pet monkey escape, and the friends embark on a breathless quest to get him back, which involves a former bullied classmate who now works for Animal Control. Rachel\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 Barry also makes a comeback, claiming that he still loves her and cannot, in fact, marry Rachel\u2019s friend Mindy. So much drama!\n\n156. The One with the Free Porn \u2013 Season four, episode 17\n\nChandler and Joey get unlimited free porn (remember this was pre high-speed Internet) while flipping through the channels and resolve never to turn off their TV set again lest they lose access. It\u2019s a silly, classic Chandler and Joey undertaking.\n\n155. The One with Phoebe's Husband \u2013 Season two, episode four\n\nPhoebe\u2019s secret husband, an ice skater who she thought was gay, comes back into her life and asks for a divorce \u2013 as it turns out, he\u2019s straight. His conversation with Phoebe is a rather clever reversal of oft-used LGBT character tropes (in college, Duncan would often wake up next to women after partying, etc).\n\n154. The One with Russ \u2013 Season two, episode 10\n\nFreshly off a fight / semi-split with Ross (can you split if you weren\u2019t really dating?) Rachel starts dating his clone, Russ (played by David Schwimmer under the alias Snaro). Of course, she insists she can\u2019t see the resemblance. It's like watching Friends through the looking-glass.\n\n153. The One Where Paul's the Man \u2013 Season six, episode 22\n\nAnd the award for most hilarious pep talk goes to... Bruce Willis, aka Paul-the-father-of-Ross\u2019s-student-girlfriend, standing in front of a mirror and assuring himself that he is \u201cthe man\u201d.\n\n152. The One Where Heckles Dies \u2013 Season two, episode three\n\nFriends tackled the topic of death in various ways throughout the show, and it did so in quite a melancholic, touching way in this episode, which is dedicated to the friends\u2019 largely unlikeable neighbour Mr Heckles.\n\n151. The One with Joey's Dirty Day \u2013 Season four, episode 14\n\nRemember when Phoebe, Rachel and Monica tried to lift Chandler\u2019s spirits after a break-up by taking him to a strip club (and convinced one of the performers to quit to teach the third grade)? Sure, the whole episode isn\u2019t handled in the most subtle of ways, but it\u2019s really quite funny.\n\n150. The One with Princess Consuela \u2013 Season 10, episode 14\n\nWhen Phoebe finds out she can change her last name to anything she wants, she goes for Princess Consuela Banana-Hammock. And backs out when her new husband (the wonderfully deadpan Paul Rudd) threatens to take the name C**p Bag.\n\n149. The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss \u2013 Season five, episode 17\n\nRachel\u2019s awkward impulse to kiss her future boss on the cheek after what had been a successful job interview is the stuff of nightmares. And of course, it only gets worse from there.\n\n148. The One with All the Poker \u2013 Season one, episode 18\n\nA competitive game of poker among all six friends becomes a way for Rachel to get over a failed job interview, and for Chandler and Joey to get confirmation that Ross is desperately in love with her. But mostly, this is the episode that taught us that \u201ccoincidence\u201d is \u201cjoincidence\u201d spelled with a \u201cj\u201d.\n\n147. The One Where Ross Can't Flirt \u2013 Season five, episode 19\n\nRoss really, really can\u2019t flirt \u2013 just watch him order multiple pizzas while attempting to charm the delivery woman, Caitlin. There\u2019s also a cute moment in which Phoebe somehow manages has a conversation in Italian with Joey\u2019s grandmother.\n\n146. The One with Rachel's Sister \u2013 Season six, episode 13\n\nReese Witherspoon steals the show as Rachel\u2019s spoiled sibling Jill \u2013 and offers a great bit of character development for Rachel, who gets to show just how far she has come since the beginning of the series.\n\n145. The One Where Chandler Takes a Bath \u2013 Season eight, episode 13\n\nJoey\u2019s feelings for Rachel create confusion in the group, Rachel accidentally finds out from Ross that they\u2019re expecting a girl \u2013 but most importantly, Chandler realises he really likes taking baths, and Matthew Perry\u2019s comedic talent shines.\n\n144. The One with Phoebe's Birthday Dinner \u2013 Season nine, episode five\n\nPhoebe is understandably frustrated when all of her friends are absurdly late for her birthday dinner. Lisa Kudrow beautifully pulls off one of Phoebe\u2019s rare but powerful fits of rage.\n\n143. The One where Monica and Richard are Just Friends \u2013 Season three, episode 13\n\nThanks to Rachel, Joey falls in love with Little Women (as he should), but is heartbroken to find out that Beth dies. On a less intellectual note, Phoebe\u2019s new date, Robert, keeps \u201ccoming out of his shorts\u201d and accidentally exposing himself.\n\n142. The One with the Tea Leaves \u2013 Season eight, episode 17\n\nIn an attempt to avoid further awkwardness with Joey, Rachel makes up absurd workplace issues and tells him her boss wants to buy her baby. But the funniest bit comes when Ross attempts to secretly retrieve his beloved salmon pink shirt from his ex-girlfriend Mona\u2019s apartment, and of course ends up getting caught.\n\n141. The One with the Dollhouse \u2013 Season three, episode 20\n\nJoey falls hard for his co-star Kate, who at first doesn\u2019t like him back. Eventually, they get together, and as their romance escalates, Joey realises how poorly he has acted towards most of his exes \u2013 so he calls them to make amends. Meanwhile, Chandler stars dating Rachel\u2019s boss Joanna and can\u2019t bring himself to stop suggesting another date, even though he finds her impossibly dull.\n\n140. The One with the Birth Mother \u2013 Season 10, episode nine\n\nUnpopular opinion: I never found the \u201cJoey doesn\u2019t share food!\u201d moment all that funny. I know, I know. However, Chandler\u2019s monologue when he begs a pregnant woman to pick him and Monica as her child\u2019s adoptive parents packs a surprising emotional punch \u2013 a major change of tone pulled off brilliantly by Matthew Perry.\n\n139. The One with the Late Thanksgiving \u2013 Season 10, episode eight\n\nMonica agrees to make dinner for the whole group, but everyone shows up late. Joey gets his head stuck in a door. A large mess ensues. But none of this matters, because Monica and Chandler get a call from their adoption agency telling them a woman has chosen them to be the parents of her baby.\n\n138. The One with the Donor \u2013 Season nine, episode 22\n\nMonica and Chandler find out they can\u2019t conceive a child and resolve to adopt. Phoebe goes out with her long-lost love David, seemingly moving on from Mike! Joey\u2019s girlfriend Charlie overhears Rachel confess her feelings for said Joey to Phoebe. All in all, this is one of the better episodes of season 10.\n\n137. The One Where the Stripper Cries \u2013 Season 10, episode 11\n\nDanny DeVito is simply unforgettable in his role as a balding, out-of-shape, yet perfectly competent stripper going by the name Officer Goodbody. And when Phoebe asks him to do his last performance for her, she gets the show of a lifetime.\n\n136. The One with Ross\u2019s Teeth \u2013 Season six, episode eight\n\nRemember when Ross whitened his teeth before a date, and they ended up really, really white? This is one of those goofy, absurdly funny lines that sticks the landing.\n\n135. The One with All the Candy \u2013 Season seven, episode nine\n\nRoss gives Phoebe a bike, then teaches her to ride it \u2013 under the scornful gaze of judgemental parents at the park. The whole thing is genuinely touching and very funny.\n\n134. The One with Rachel's Date \u2013 Season eight, episode five\n\nPhoebe begins to date Monica\u2019s sous-chef, then wants to break up with him \u2013 but Monica also wants to fire him. Both agree that said sous-chef shouldn\u2019t be dumped and fired on the same day, but neither wants to wait. Hilarity ensues.\n\n133. The One with Monica's Thunder \u2013 Season seven, episode one\n\nMonica and Chandler just got engaged! Rachel and Ross kissed in the hallway! Monica is thus convinced that Rachel wants to steal her thunder on this glorious day! Rachel and Ross\u2019s dialogue as they pretend to sleep together (as part of Rachel\u2019s elaborate plan to get on Monica\u2019s nerves) is laugh-out-loud funny.\n\n132. The One with Joey's New Girlfriend \u2013 Season four, episode five\n\nRoss and Rachel try to make each other jealous by dating, respectively, a woman who is looking for a baby sitter rather than a boyfriend, and a thief. A good reminder that these two had amazing chemistry as angry exes. Chandler tries to mask his growing feelings for Joey\u2019s girlfriend, Kathy \u2013 and Matthew Perry delivers a wonderfully impassioned monologue about how much he loves her.\n\n131. The One Where Joey Moves Out \u2013 Season two, episode 16\n\nAs the title suggests, Joey moves out of the apartment he shared with Chandler, as the two struggle to cohabit. It was always sad to see these two fight, but it made for good, rather genuine television. Phoebe and Rachel\u2019s experience at a tattoo parlour (Rachel gets a heart tattooed on her hip while Phoebe stops the process after getting just a dot underneath her clavicle) provides great comic relief.\n\n130. The One at the Beach \u2013 Season three, episode 25\n\nPhoebe tries to find her birth mother in Montauk, and things get atrociously jumbled as Ross attempts to choose between staying with his girlfriend Bonnie or going back with Rachel. All in all, this is a good, eventful season finale.\n\n129. The One Where They All Turn 30 \u2013 Season seven, episode 14\n\nRachel has trouble coping with the fact that she\u2019s turning 30, prompting the whole group to reminisce about their own past birthdays. We learn that when Ross turned 30, he bought a ridiculous sports car that became stuck between two other parked vehicles. In a flashback sequence, Ross repeatedly instructs his friends to \u201clift and slide\u201d the car in an attempt to un-wedge it \u2013 in a sequence reminiscent of his classic \u201cPivot!\u201d.\n\n128. The One with the Yeti \u2013 Season five, episode six\n\nEmily, who is still recovering from Ross\u2019s infamous \u201cRachel\u201d slip at the altar, asks him to sell his furniture and move to a new apartment as they attempt to rekindle their relationship. As her demands escalate, Ross realises she will never trust him again, and the two decide to split for good \u2013 finally.\n\n127. The One Where Eddie Won't Go \u2013 Season two, episode 19\n\nRemember Eddie, Chandler\u2019s extremely strange roommate played (brilliantly) by Adam Goldberg? He was so weird. And so very funny.\n\n126. The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel \u2013 Season six, episode two\n\nRachel is trying to get Ross to annul their union after they drunkenly got married in Las Vegas. Ross is reluctant to do so because he doesn\u2019t want a third failed marriage to his name, and because \u2013 as it turns out \u2013 he still has feelings for Rachel. Rachel, meanwhile, must accept the fact that her roommate Monica is going to move in with Chandler, and come to terms with the fact that \u201cit\u2019s the end of an era\u201d.\n\n125. The One with Christmas in Tulsa \u2013 Season nine, episode 10\n\nChandler, who has accidentally accepted a job transfer to Tulsa, Oklahoma, spends the lousiest Christmas ever in his office. One of his coworkers starts flirting with him, prompting him to realise how much he misses his wife Monica \u2013 and to hand in his resignation, in a rather satisfying mini plot twist.\n\n124. The One with Two Parts, Part One \u2013 Season one, episode 16\n\nSeeing Joey date Phoebe\u2019s twin sister Ursula will always feel strange, but the storyline plays out nicely, and it gives a deeper look into Phoebe and Joey\u2019s friendship \u2013 one of the sweetest bonds among the group.\n\n123. The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits \u2013 Season 10, episode five\n\nJoey attempts to write a letter of recommendation for Chandler and Monica\u2019s adoption case, overuses his thesaurus, and ends up writing it in his own words \u2013 aka, like a child. Mike is desperate to pop the question to Phoebe, who keeps unknowingly mocking his repeated proposal attempts before they happen.\n\n122. The One After Joey and Rachel Kiss \u2013 Season 10, episode one\n\nMonica, Chandler and Phoebe team up to eavesdrop both on Charlie and Ross (who just got together) and Rachel and Joey (ditto). The episode even takes on vaudeville undertones after Chandler pulls Joey out of Rachel\u2019s room unbeknownst to a puzzled Rachel and an oblivious Ross.\n\n121. The One with the Candy Hearts \u2013 Season one, episode 14\n\nCarol, pregnant with Ben, ends up alone at a restaurant on Valentine\u2019s Day after Susan needs to leave to tend to an emergency. Ross, who happens to be seated close to her (and is on a date of his own) tells her to come over. The evening devolves into a last-ditch effort for Ross to get his ex-wife back \u2013 until he finally accepts that they will never reunite. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel stage a \u201cboyfriend bonfire\u201d (in which they burn memories of their respective exes) and bond with firefighters after the blaze gets out of hand.\n\n120. The One with Rachel's Dream \u2013 Season nine, episode 19\n\nRoss and Chandler end up going together on a romantic weekend to Vermont (it\u2019s a long story) and in an attempt to pay themselves back for the price of their room, embark on a quest to collect as many freebies as possible. And of course, Ross eats too many pieces of maple candy, which is a golden opportunity for David Schwimmer to pull off his \u201chyper Ross\u201d performance.\n\n119. The One Where Old Yeller Dies \u2013 Season two, episode 20\n\nPhoebe\u2019s shocked when she realises her mother shielded her from most sad movie endings throughout her childhood \u2013 and starts catching up on her pop-culture education. Ross causes (his then-girlfriend) Rachel to panic when he tells her he\u2019s already mapped out their future as parents in the suburbs. Their argument ends with possibly the most angsty first \u201cI love you\u201d in the history of television.\n\n118. The One with Ross's Denial \u2013 Season six, episode three\n\nYes, it was fun to watch an enamoured Ross make one bad decision after the next while refusing to admit to himself that he was still madly in love with Rachel \u2013 and at this point in the show, he still hadn\u2019t told Rachel that he had failed to get their Las Vegas marriage annulled.\n\n117. The One with the Stoned Guy \u2013 Season one, episode 15\n\nMonica desperately wants to impress the owner of a restaurant she\u2019s hoping will hire her as a chef, but he\u2019s high and more interested in plain taco shells and gummy bears than her gourmet cuisine. Oh, and Ross\u2019s date urges him to talk dirty to her, resulting in him blurting out the word \u201cvulva\u201d.\n\n116. The One Where They're Up All Night \u2013 Season seven, episode 12\n\nThe title says it all: for a variety of reasons, no one can get a good night\u2019s sleep. Ross and Joey are stuck on the roof, Tag and Rachel are caught up in a work-related argument, Chandler has insomnia and won\u2019t let Monica sleep, and \u2013 the funniest of all \u2013 Phoebe\u2019s fire alarm keeps beeping for no apparent reason.\n\n115. The One with Ross's Step Forward / The One with The Creepy Holiday Card \u2013 Season eight, episode 11\n\nRoss freaks out when his girlfriend Mona suggests they send a holiday card together and, in an attempt to avoid a difficult conversation, gives her a key (the only key) to his apartment. Classic Ross.\n\n114. The One with Ross's Inappropriate Song \u2013 Season nine, episode seven\n\nNew parents Ross and Rachel discover that the only way to get their baby daughter to laugh is to rap \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d, Sir Mix-A-Lot\u2019s not exactly child-friendly hit. So what to they do? They rap. Poorly, inappropriately, and hilariously.\n\n113. The One with the Fake Monica \u2013 Season one, episode 21\n\nThis one is so weird, yet so interesting. When Monica\u2019s credit card gets stolen, she catches the thief \u2013 who turns out to be a woman with a very fun, very criminal life. Her one-episode friendship with the real Monica is surprisingly touching, and it also helps Monica accept herself for who she is.\n\n112. The One Where Rosita Dies \u2013 Season seven, episode 13\n\nRosita, aka Joey\u2019s reclining armchair, meets her untimely demise. Rachel buys him a new one, but Chandler, who thinks he\u2019s responsible for the tragedy, replaces Rosita with his own chair, leading to some confusion on Joey\u2019s part. All this is pretty entertaining, but nowhere near as interesting as Phoebe\u2019s attempt to keep an office worker named Earl from taking his own life. Their exchange is full of dark humour, and it's always interesting to see Phoebe \u2013 quirky, fun Phoebe \u2013 manage a high-stakes situation.\n\n111. The One Where Eddie Moves In \u2013 Season two, episode 17\n\nRemember when Phoebe shot a music video for \u201cSmelly Cat\u201d and wasn\u2019t even sad when she realised her voice had been replaced by another woman\u2019s? Fun times.\n\n110. The One with Rachel's Book \u2013 Season seven, episode two\n\nJoey finds Rachel\u2019s erotic book and tries to make fun of her for it, but seems to be confused as to the meaning of the word \u201cvicar\u201d. And look, after seven seasons of the guys\u2019 monopoly on porn, it was nice to see a female character (especially prim and proper Rachel) getting in on the fun.\n\n109. The One Where Rachel Smokes \u2013 Season five, episode 18\n\nRachel worries that her status as a non-smoker means she\u2019s getting excluded from important conversations at work \u2013 a delightfully Nineties concern. Also, Phoebe (who is arranging a surprise birthday party with Monica) pronounces the sentence: \u201cMonica is going to rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice\u201d, which is just epic.\n\n108. The One with Ross's Wedding, Part One \u2013 Season four, episode 23\n\nAll the friends except a very pregnant Phoebe fly to London, where Ross is about to marry Emily \u2013 and find out the venue is getting torn down. Joey, who is initially incredibly excited to visit the English capital, ends up feeling comically homesick after one phone call to New York.\n\n107. The One with George Stephanopoulos \u2013 Season one, episode four\n\nMonica, Phoebe and Rachel are having the most depressing slumber party in history until they find out that their pizza has been accidentally delivered to George Stephanopoulos \u2013 and proceed to try to spy on the TV star. Oh, to be young in the Nineties in New York City.\n\n106. The One Where Rachel Quits \u2013 Season three, episode 10\n\nRachel quits her job as a waitress in search of a better career path. By the end of the episode, she has a new gig, which mainly consists of making coffee for her boss. Still, it\u2019s her first job in fashion \u2013 and the first step in Rachel\u2019s series-long path to success.\n\n105. The One with Rachel's Other Sister \u2013 Season nine, episode eight\n\nReese Witherspoon couldn\u2019t return as Rachel\u2019s sibling Jill, so Christina Applegate was cast as her \u201cother sister\u201d \u2013 and did a remarkable job at bringing the insufferable, tactless Amy to life. This time around, Amy manages to get invited to Thanksgiving dinner with the group and has the gall to get outraged when she learns that, should Rachel and Ross die, she wouldn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d their daughter Emma \u2013 whom she keeps calling the wrong name.\n\n104. The One After the Superbowl, Part Two \u2013 Season two, episode 13\n\nThis one was odd but fun \u2013 and it just screams Nineties nostalgia. By its second season, Friends was popular enough to attract some high-profile guest stars. Hence, Rachel and Monica fight over Jean-Claude Van Damme (I know, awwww) and Chandler goes out with a former schoolmate played by Julia Roberts. Delightful.\n\n103. The One with the Proposal, Part One \u2013 Season six, episode 24\n\nSure. Chandler\u2019s plans to propose to Monica are very touching, but this episode\u2019s real * chef kiss * moment happens when Ross\u2019s student / girlfriend, Elizabeth, bombards him with water balloons after he breaks up with her. You GO, Elizabeth.\n\n102. The One with the Prom Video \u2013 Season two, episode 14\n\nAny sequence in which the friends are seen during their college years is headed straight to Cringeville (hello, Courteney Cox in a fat suit). Only redeeming moment: when Rachel realises that many years ago, Ross was ready to step in after her prom date had apparently failed to show up. Thus, Ross and Rachel, who had sort of got together but not really, kiss again, and one of network television\u2019s most iconic couples is reborn for good.\n\n101. The One with Ross's Thing \u2013 Season three, episode 23\n\nRoss has a thing on his backside. Is it a mole? Is it a cyst? No one seems to know! Only one thing is certain: Ross\u2019s attempts to find out will be increasingly humiliating.\n\n100. The One Where Rachel Is Late \u2013 Season eight, episode 22\n\nRachel is late. Late for what, you ask? To give birth, of course! She\u2019s exhausted and justifiably cranky as her pregnancy continues past its term. A reminder if needed of Jennifer Aniston\u2019s comedic talent.\n\n99. The One with Rachel\u2019s Going-Away Party \u2013 Season 10, episode 16\n\nWhat a tearjerker. Rachel is preparing to leave New York for Paris, Chandler and Monica are about to move to the suburbs, and the series is nearing its end. The scenes in which Rachel bids goodbye to Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey are lovely \u2013 and at the time they aired, they must have provided some catharsis to heartbroken fans bidding the show farewell. After all this, of course, Ross and Rachel argue, then kiss \u2013 and set up the finale perfectly.\n\n98. The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding, Part One \u2013 Season seven, episode 23\n\nFriends had such a knack for wedding episodes. Monica and Chandler\u2019s nuptials were especially lovely, not just thanks to the lovely couple, but also because the writers made sure to include interesting storylines in addition to the wedding itself. Here, we not only get to watch Chandler and Monica preparing to tie the knot (cute! And a bit stressful when Chandler goes missing) but we also find out \u2013 gasp! \u2013 that one of the friends is pregnant.\n\n97. The One Where Ross Moves In \u2013 Season five, episode seven\n\nRoss moves in with Chandler and Joey \u2013 and turns out to be the most insufferable roommate in the world. Phoebe dates an over-eager restaurant inspector, and Rachel, desperate for her new neighbour Danny to ask her out, proves surprisingly inept at playing it cool. It\u2019s a fun, lovely little Friends episode, where nothing major happens except for about 20 minutes of perfectly enjoyable television.\n\n96. The One Where Chandler Can't Cry \u2013 Season six, episode 14\n\nRemember when Ross briefly dated Rachel\u2019s sister Jill? That was weird, right? Weird but interesting. Meanwhile, Phoebe finds out that her identical twin sister Ursula is starring in pornographic films and using her name \u2013 and handles the situation with her usual panache.\n\n95. The One with the Kips \u2013 Season five, episode five\n\nChandler and Monica have their first fight as a couple \u2013 and Chandler is flabbergasted to learn that this doesn\u2019t signify the end of their relationship. A worthwhile lesson for every couple: it\u2019s OK to argue! Speaking of which, Ross\u2019s wife Emily asks Ross not to see Rachel anymore, after he accidentally said her name at the altar.\n\n94. The One Where Phoebe Runs \u2013 Season six, episode seven\n\nSometimes, to write a page of TV history, you need to resort to hi-jinks and / or an abundance of dramatic tension. Other times, you can just have Phoebe Buffay run in a rather\u2026 unique way in Central Park.\n\n93. The One Where Joey Dates Rachel \u2013 Season eight, episode 12\n\nJoey takes a pregnant Rachel out on a date, because she misses that part of her social life. It\u2019s all very cute, although it foreshadows Joey\u2019s forever-kind-of-uncomfortable crush on Rachel. The best part, though, comes when Ross desperately tries to hold on to a new teaching slot, even though it takes place \u201cacross town\u201d, aka on the other side of Manhattan. After several desperate attempts to cross the sizeable borough in 10 minutes (one of which results in him fainting), he winds up teaching on rollerblades.\n\n92. The One with Two Parts, Part Two \u2013 Season one, episode 17\n\nGeorge Clooney and Noah Wyle make a cameo as two doctors treating Rachel after she hurts her ankle. It\u2019s an ER / Friends crossover, in the mid-Nineties, back when both shows were in their infancy. Things don\u2019t get much better than this.\n\n91. The One with the Princess Leia Fantasy \u2013 Season three, episode one\n\nMonica is so devastated after her break-up from Richard that she can\u2019t sleep \u2013 until her father Jack drops by and tells her that Richard, too, is a wreck. Somehow, Monica\u2019s story arc turns from painfully raw to very sweet in a matter of 20 minutes. And that, my friend, is what they call quality television.\n\n90. The One with the Worst Best Man Ever \u2013 Season four, episode 22\n\nJoey might be the worst best man in the history of matrimony, but Phoebe steals the show as the funniest, angriest pregnant woman who keeps snapping at her friends \u2013 all while denying she\u2019s having mood swings. Just watch her yell at the crowd during her baby shower.\n\n89. The One with the Sharks \u2013 Season nine, episode four\n\nAfter telling Phoebe\u2019s boyfriend Mike that Phoebe has never had a serious relationship, Ross tries to fix his mistake \u2013 by posing as her super serious (and extremely fictional) ex Vikram, a kite designer.\n\n88. The One with the Baby Shower \u2013 Season eight, episode 20\n\nRachel becomes convinced she won\u2019t manage to take care of her baby by herself and welcomes her mother\u2019s offer to move in with her after the birth. Ross, however, steps in, and Rachel realises that 1) she won\u2019t raise the baby alone as he will be there, and 2) she is absolutely capable of taking care of a child. It\u2019s easy to forget, among all the jokes and the usual sitcom bells and whistles, how much Rachel grew as a character over the course of 10 seasons \u2013 and this episode serves as a useful reminder.\n\n87. The One Where They're Going to Party! \u2013 Season four, episode nine\n\nAfter learning that her own boss, Joanna, sabotaged her application for a position as assistant buyer because she doesn\u2019t want to lose her as a PA, Rachel is promised a significant promotion. Sadly, Joanna dies before any paperwork could go through to make the changes official \u2013 meaning Rachel is back to square one. Rachel always had to battle to advance her career, but this particular setback was\u2026 unexpected, to say the least.\n\n86. The One in Massapequa / The One with the Zesty Guy \u2013 Season eight, episode 18\n\nAlec Baldwin is simply fantastic as Phoebe\u2019s super! cheerful! boyfriend Parker. Initially, Phoebe tries to embrace his joie de vivre, until she snaps and equates him to \u201cSanta Claus on Prozac at Disneyland, getting laid\u201d. What a diss.\n\n85. The One with the Paediatrician \u2013 Season nine, episode three\n\nRachel (and, soon after, the rest of the friends) discover that Ross is still seeing his childhood paediatrician, much to the group\u2019s delight. More impo", "description": "Over the course of 10 years and 10 seasons, the writers of Friends delivered no fewer than 236 episodes to their ever-increasing fan base. Fifteen years after the finale aired, bringing the adventures of Rachel, Ross, Joey, Chandler, Phoebe and Monica to an end, it is still nigh impossible to pick\u00a0a single favourite episode. It feels as though each 20-or-so-minute nugget", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mence Michallon"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/01/15/gettyimages-908371.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-03"}
