I know my father wanted to provide for her while she was living. I was told he wouldn\u2019t let her sell the house while she was alive. She just passed away and we were told that she gave the house to her daughter. They lived in Florida. I know he left us kids something, but she kept that hidden.\n\nCan you help?\n\nCW\n\nDear CW,\n\nI have received so many letters over the years from people who have had issues with stepmothers. They do get a hard time in Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales.One such stepparent refused to hand over a family\u2019s heirlooms. In fact, the most popular column of last year featured a stepmother\u2019s children who reportedly looted her late husband\u2019s estate. It seems to be a sensitive subject for many people.\n\nAll wills must be filed with probate court, so your late stepmother did not have the power or the legal right to hide it from you. Most of this sort of skulduggery \u2014 if that is indeed what went on here \u2014 relies on other people\u2019s inaction. I\n\nn Florida, the custodian of a will must file it within 10 days of the person\u2019s death or, if not, within a reasonable time after that person\u2019s death. Any interested parties \u2014 those who are mentioned in the will or anyone who is deemed a legal heir \u2014 should also be notified within 30 days, according to UpChurch Law in Daytona Beach, Fla.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Americans who were \u2018scarred\u2019 by the Great Recession changed the way they spend\n\nAssuming your father died more than a few months ago, you have likely missed the statute for limitations for contesting his will. Given that your stepmother recently passed away, there may be room for you to make a claim on the estate.\n\nThere may be some loopholes that allow you to make a claim on the estate, especially if your stepmother acted unlawfully or if she was living in a home that was in her late husband\u2019s name. It may be that your stepmother was given a life estate under which she could live in the home for the remainder of her life, but it goes to you and your siblings upon her death.\n\nAs for your story, there are so many missing pieces. Was there a will? If so, what did it say? It\u2019s worth your while making inquiries. If your father left no will, or no will was filed at the time of his death, you and your siblings would receive half of the community property under Florida law, while your stepmother would receive the other half.\n\nStart with an estate lawyer and make inquiries at the probate court in the county where your stepmother and father died. You may yet be in luck.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?
