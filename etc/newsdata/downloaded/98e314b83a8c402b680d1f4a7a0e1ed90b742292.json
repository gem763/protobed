His deposition is the latest in a string of appearances by civil servants and political appointees providing details about President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE\u2019s contacts with Ukraine.\n\nTaylor is considered a high-value witness because he appeared to threaten to quit his post after describing a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d in text messages with two other U.S. diplomats \u2014 Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerPutin, Hungarian leader pushed Trump on Ukraine corruption narrative: reports Diplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe Overnight Energy: Watchdog warns of threats to federal workers on public lands | Perry to step down on December 1 | Trump declines to appear in Weather Channel climate special MORE, then Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to messages Volker turned over to the House, Taylor raised concerns that Ukraine would make good on providing an unspecified \u201cinterview,\u201d but that Trump would renege on almost $400 million in military aid.\n\n\u201cThe nightmare is they give the interview and don\u2019t get the security assistance,\u201d Taylor texted to Volker and Sondland, according to transcripts released by Democrats. \u201cThe Russians love it. (And I quit).\u201d\n\nThe next day, Taylor warned Sondland that Trump\u2019s previous decision to withhold the aid had already strained relations between the two allies to the benefit of Russia, which launched an incursion into Ukraine in 2014 and annexed eastern parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key,\u201d Taylor wrote. \u201cWith the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. This is my nightmare scenario.\u201d\n\nThat fear came as Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Diplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe Pelosi releases 'fact sheet' saying Trump has 'betrayed his oath of office' MORE, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was seeking a statement from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that addressed both Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that employed former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Warren to protest with striking Chicago teachers Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE\u2019s son and a debunked conspiracy theory related to interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe text messages provided by Volker also allude to phone calls Taylor had with Volker and Sondland about Ukraine policy. Democrats are eager to learn more about those discussions.\n\n\u201cHe was interacting with Volker and Sondland about this alleged scheme to pressure the Ukrainian government to assist with a domestic, political initiative,\u201d said Rep.

So I think it is very important to hear from him [and] educate us about what he was thinking when he wrote those messages,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDemocrats hope Taylor\u2019s stated concerns about the administration\u2019s policy toward Ukraine, combined with his tenure as a career official, will make him a helpful witness as they seek to determine whether Trump withheld aid as leverage to get Zelensky to open an investigation into Biden, one of his top 2020 political opponents.\n\nWhile Democrats argue that Trump used the aid as leverage, Republicans contend that witnesses like Sondland \u2014 and even Volker\u2019s text messages \u2014 back up Trump\u2019s assertion that there was no quid pro quo.\n\nTaylor\u2019s appearance on Tuesday will follow similar depositions from career State Department officials in recent weeks, including Fiona Hill, a former special assistant to the president; Michael McKinley, a former staffer to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoDiplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan Mulvaney faces uncertain future after public gaffes MORE; and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent.\n\nDemocrats have indicated they view the testimonies of career officials as more credible than those of the political witnesses, including Sondland.\n\nTaylor has amassed a long record of public service after graduating from West Point and Harvard. In 2006, he served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine for three years. After Marie Yovanovitch was recalled from that same post earlier this year, Taylor was tapped to serve as charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires for Ukraine.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that he is yet another career public servant who is apolitical who comes forward to tell us what was really happening, not what was happening from a standpoint of trying to protect yourself or trying to give a spin to the situation,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said, in what appeared to be a jab at Sondland.\n\nIn the text message thread, Sondland, a wealthy hotel owner and GOP mega-donor, forcefully pushed back against Taylor\u2019s comments about Ukraine aid, telling Taylor he was \u201cincorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland later wrote. \u201cThe President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelenskiy promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nTaylor, however, remained skeptical.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d he wrote, in what appeared to be a reference to alleged efforts by Trump and Giuliani to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nSondland testified last week that he was unaware of any efforts to have Zelensky open a Biden probe, but he also said Trump insisted during a short phone call with him that there was no quid pro quo for aid, according to his prepared remarks for testimony.\n\nDemocrats walked away from Sondland\u2019s deposition with varying opinions on his credibility, with some saying he appeared to be trying to protect his reputation from fallout from the Ukraine affair. Still, Democrats said the Trump official confirmed allegations brought forward in a whistleblower complaint about Trump pressing Zelensky to open a corruption probe into Biden.\n\nTaylor is one of the few officials on the schedule for testimony this week. Deposition dates were shuffled around on Monday to accommodate events honoring Rep. Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsDiplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe House rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff Overnight Defense: Trump weighs leaving some troops in Syria to 'secure the oil' | US has pulled 2,000 troops from Afghanistan | Pelosi leads delegation to Afghanistan, Jordan MORE (D-Md.), the House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman who died last week.\n\nWhile Democrats initially had multiple witnesses planned for the week, an official working on the inquiry announced the change of plans Monday, noting that Taylor would still be testifying Tuesday and a top Defense official would follow on Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to several postponements, Democrats also have seen two more Trump administration officials vow not to comply with their subpoenas.\n\nThe postponements raise questions about whether Democrats will be able to wrap up their inquiry by the end of the year, a informal deadline members have pointed to as a possible time when they will reach a decision on impeachment.\n\nRep.
