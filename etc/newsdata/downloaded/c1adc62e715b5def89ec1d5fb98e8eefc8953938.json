But as more members of her caucus pressed for a probe \u2014 including crucial moderates in political swing districts \u2014 the speaker planned to huddle with her members late Tuesday afternoon. Advisors said she would make a statement on the path forward at 5pm.\n\nIn an appearance ahead of that meeting, Ms Pelosi, 79, sidestepped questions about whether she believed Mr Trump\u2019s actions were impeachable, but she said it would be wrong for the president to ask a foreign leader for help investigating Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask foreign governments to help us in our election,\u201d Ms Pelosi said.\n\nAn impeachment inquiry into a president in the middle of his reelection campaign is virtually certain to exacerbate the nation\u2019s partisan divides.\n\nMr Trump has all but dared Democrats to take that step, confident that the specter of impeachment led by the opposition party would bolster his political support.\n\nMs Pelosi has shared that concern and has spent months trying to hold off liberals in her caucus pushing for impeachment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "The US intelligence official who \u201cblew the whistle\u201d on Donald Trump\u2019s phone call with the leader of Ukraine reportedly wants to testify\u00a0before Congress.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/16/donald-trump-globalism.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
