REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo\n\nThe approach, made public after the city\u2019s markets closed on Wednesday, received a cool response in London, where LSE shares finished up 5.9% - far short of the premium implied by the indicative offer from Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (0388.HK).\n\nHKEX shares were off 3.3% in afternoon trade in Hong Kong, underperforming the blue-chip Hang Seng Index .HSI which was down 0.3%.\n\nThe proposed deal aims to create an exchange powerhouse spanning Asia and Europe which would be better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) and CME Group inc (CME.O).\n\nBut tough political and technical challenges have already emerged.\n\nThe HKEX proposal is conditional on LSE abandoning a $27 billion acquisition of financial information provider Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N) and Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.TO). Thomson Reuters is the parent of Reuters News.\n\nThat deal, which went public in late July, caused LSE\u2019s shares to leap 15% on hopes Refinitiv\u2019s financial data business would boost LSE\u2019s long-term profitability. LSE said in a statement on Wednesday that it remained committed to the Refinitiv deal.\n\nThe approach by the HKEX also comes as Hong Kong enters a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.\n\nThe government\u2019s handling of the protests has been criticized internationally, as has the political pressure applied by Beijing to Hong Kong companies not to support the pro-democracy movement. Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK), for one, was ordered to suspend staff who were involved in or supported the demonstrations.\n\nAnalysts said the perception of Beijing\u2019s growing influence over Hong Kong could become a key sticking point given the government\u2019s close links with the HKEX.\n\nFitch Ratings said in a report that \u201cincreasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong\u201d could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security.\n\nThe Hong Kong government holds a 6% stake in the HKEX, approves six of the 13 board members and can also stop any other shareholding rising above 5%.\n\n\u201cThe transaction will require various regulatory approvals, which will stress-test the world\u2019s understanding of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 constitution,\u201d said David Blennerhassett, an independent analyst writing on the SmartKarma research platform.\n\n\u201cIt will be politically tough now and in the near-term to get this through various regulatory channels,\u201d he added.\n\nHKEX DOWNGRADE\n\nAnalysts said HKEX\u2019s share price fall reflected investor concern about the dilutive impact of the cash-and-shares offer, and scepticism the offer would succeed.\n\n\u201cIf the market thought the deal was going to go ahead, I would have expected the shares to have fallen by more than 3%, typically that\u2019s what we\u2019d expect for an acquirer in a deal like this,\u201d said Michael Wu, analyst at Morningstar.\n\nUnder the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE if the deal went through.\n\nCitigroup downgraded HKEX to \u2018sell\u2019 from \u2018buy\u2019, saying the acquisition price was high and could \u201cadd downward pressure\u201d to the exchange\u2019s shares and valuation. Regulatory hurdles for the deal were also high, it said in its research note.\n\nAnalysts however said they could see strategic logic in HKEX\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cWe believe that bringing the largest listed exchanges in Asia and Europe together could create new revenue streams and a lot depends on how well HKEX can capitalise on this,\u201d Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Jonas Kan wrote in a research report.", "description": "Shares in the Hong Kong stock exchange fell more than 3% on Thursday as investors cast doubt on the merits of its $39 billion takeover approach to London Stock Exchange Plc (LSE) , a deal that would create a global financial giant.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hughes", "Sumeet Chatterjee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428887403&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B02U-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
