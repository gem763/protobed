The findings of the investigation, a summary of which was released to NBC employees on May 9, 2018, stated that NBC officials had not received formal complaints regarding Lauer\u2019s conduct before November 27, 2017.\n\nHowever, investigators also found Lauer could be \u201cflirtatious, would frequently make jokes, some with sexual overtones, and would openly engage in sexually-oriented banter in the workplace.\u201d\n\nLauer denies the allegations against him.\n\nFormer NBC reporter Ronan Farrow has repeatedly alleged that the company received complaints of sexual misconduct against Lauer years before his 2017 firing from the Today Show, and that network executives tried to suppress Farrow\u2019s story on movie producer Harvey Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct due to concerns that Weinstein would expose Lauer\u2019s misconduct.\n\nFarrow further alleged that NBC entered into multiple non-disclosure agreements with women who reported Lauer\u2019s behavior.\n\nNBC head Noah Oppenheim has denied Farrows allegations, labelling them a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday former NBC host Megyn Kelley called for an outside investigation into the company to discover whether or not the non-disclosure agreements exist.\n\n\u201cBased on our investigative findings, we have swiftly taken appropriate actions to address the situation and improve workplace culture,\u201d Smith said in her defense of NBC\u2019s 2018 investigation. \u201cIt is also worth noting that this was a corporate investigation that was conducted by an almost entirely female team, none of whom are part of the News division.\u201d", "description": "NBC News has confirmed that they will not commission an outside investigation into the alleged sexual misconduct of former Today Show host Matt Lauer.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
