Maybe they felt the high-school story was done after seven episodes. Maybe they didn\u2019t want to end on a low note. Maybe they just could not resist the urge to get Bette Midler and Judith Light in the mix as soon as heavenly possible. But there\u2019s another possibility: Maybe Payton\u2019s journey this season wasn\u2019t a line, but rather a circle, another trip through the Wash & Brush Up Company we see in those opening titles. He picked up other things during that trip, so maybe he starts with some new pieces in those tiny boxes. A drinking problem. Loss. Regret. Gratitude for the forgiveness of others. And presumably, the knowledge of what it\u2019s like to have legions of devoted fans who want nothing more than to hear you sing \u201cVienna\u201d over and over again, no matter how drunk you are.\n\nMaybe season one ends with the beginning of season two, because the point of Payton\u2019s cycle is not the end of the election. The point is to launch the next one.\n\nWe rejoin Payton in New York City, where we learn he\u2019s attending NYU and serenading people in a bar. A drink sits on the top of the piano and his eyes flit to it now and again, but mostly this is about the physical and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 emotional act of singing. Payton is feeling with his whole body, and drinking with his whole body, and puking with his whole body. (Seriously, Ben Platt hurls himself off that couch headfirst.) But his eyes don\u2019t just flit to the drink. They also flit to a table in the back, where the first and second of many welcome surprises await: Infinity, with lustrous hair and gorgeous nails that scream money, and Skye, who is not wearing an orange jumpsuit. Later, they wander the streets and reminisce. Skye\u2019s lawyer was a genius. Infinity got a huge book advance and is getting more free stuff than ever. And they became friends at a shoot for a Vanity Fair article, which was unkind to Payton. They were both, Infinity and Skye assure him, misquoted.\n\nSo here he is, a college student with a drinking problem and, just because, a world-class singing voice, someone layered and messy and a little bit broken and undeniably human. And the tone of the show reflects that. All the performances are more naturalistic; that heightened rhythm and energy pops up only occasionally. (The best example comes from Alice, more on that later.) They\u2019ve grown up a little, and they\u2019ve stopped playing pretend.\n\nPayton hasn\u2019t left everything from that time behind, however. James is his roommate. He\u2019s still pining for Alice. River wanders the club from time to time, bussing tables and saying nothing at all, until a wedding invitation \u2014 for Alice and a guy named Thad \u2014 sends Payton on a quest to get her back, with his dead friend riding shotgun. It seems that River\u2019s presence \u2014 as an emotional coach, or the personification of the part of Payton that feels, or his Dream Ghost, whatever you like \u2014 has been roused by Payton\u2019s slow return to life, and he\u2019s around to make sure that no one changes the station when the Cure comes on.\n\nHe\u2019s also there to encourage Payton to do the things that terrify him, such as walk up to Alice on campus even though her fianc\u00e9 is there, and at least consider the opportunity that McAfee and James toss into his lap.\n\nThe Alice conversation comes first, and it\u2019s not only one of the best scenes in the episode, but in the series. Finally, finally, Alice becomes a real person, and Julia Schlaepfer gets some meaty stuff to do. She asks why he didn\u2019t turn back, a question that definitely got more potent with time, and defends herself and her choices while crumbling just a little bit with every moment. Then this stunner of a moment, as she leaves the coffee shop weeping: She turns back and says, in the voice and demeanor of the old Alice, the one playing the role of First Lady: \u201cMaybe we could have an affair or something.\u201d She almost pulls it off, dropping the mask right at the end. Then she leaves.\n\nThe next time we see Alice, she\u2019s sitting in a dorm room with Skye, McAfee, James, and Astrid, telling Payton he\u2019s got to run, and that they\u2019re all there to help him. He demurs, saying he can\u2019t win, and that\u2019s when a vaping Astrid drops the bombshell: His opponent is in a throuple.\n\nWe know that already, of course. A significant portion of the first half of this episode is devoted to introducing us to New York State Senator Dede Standish (Judith Light) and her chief-of-staff, Hadassah Gold (Bette Midler), who spend that time either (a) getting courted by a hot senator from Texas (Sam Jaegar) who is planning to run for the Presidency and wants a running mate from the moment he announces. All he wants to know is that she has no skeletons in her closet. She doesn\u2019t, but she does have a husband (Joe Morton) and a third, equal partner in their marriage (Teddy Sears). And she\u2019s also got a campaign dependent on a grouchy office manager (the great Jackie Hoffman!), Windows 98, stickers, and an intern. Each and every one of those scenes is so lively and bright that they\u2019re impossible to resist; I\u2019m a little furious that I can\u2019t watch the next episode right this second.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a hell of a lot of fun, weird, and a little wild, with a lot of emotional truth \u2014 precisely the balance The Politician never seemed to strike early on. This first season had its ups and downs, and some major flaws, but like Payton, it seems to want to get better, to keep improving, and to do something good. It stands a pretty decent chance of that, because the biggest takeaway from this odd, premiere-shaped finale is this: Both Payton and The Politician have loads of potential.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 Written and directed by Brad Falchuk.\n\n\u2022 Big week for Billy Joel on television!\n\n\u2022 \u201cI didn\u2019t, of course, that would be a heinous crime.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cThat\u2019s the last scene of The Graduate, Payton, and if you think that\u2019s a happy ending, you should probably watch it again.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Alice stopping a cab by hurling her bouquet is going to make a hell of a GIF.\n\n\u2022 Costume of the episode: As much as I loved seeing Alice\u2019s enormous wedding dress spilling over that tin bed, Judith and Bette were dressed like ketchup and mustard for that last shot. So clever and fun.\n\n\u2022 Thanks so much for reading this season!", "description": "An odd, premiere-shaped finale points the way forward for Payton, and for The Politician.
