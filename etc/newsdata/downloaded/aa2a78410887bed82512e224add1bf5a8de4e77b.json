Reuters reported that the ECB decision to restart bond purchases was opposed by the president of the Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, though it\u2019s unlikely he expressed his distaste with a photo montage.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to point out that Draghi isn\u2019t a fan of German policies, either. He subtly took aim at the country for running a budget surplus at a time its own economy appears to be headed into a recession.\n\n\u201cIn view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner,\u201d Draghi said. He said there was \u201cunanimous\u201d agreement at the ECB of the need for fiscal policy to become the main instrument to drive the eurozone economy forward, which has inflation a full percentage point below its target.\n\nParadoxically, Germans have saved more as the interest rate has declined, with the savings rate reaching 11% last year, up from the low 9% level in 2013.", "description": "Not everyone\u2019s a fan of the European Central Bank\u2019s package of easing measures delivered Thursday.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR233_draghi_ZG_20190913040546.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
