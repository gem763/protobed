People better get entering Maura, or you'll be gutted.\"\n\nMaura looked super confused as she stared at her phone, in what mirrored a scene from a slasher horror film.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAs the show continued, Holly and Phil looked completely unnerved by the moment, with Holly saying: \"Oh my gosh, a bit harsh...\"\n\nPhillip was equally as creeped out adding: \"A bit sinister isn't it?\"\n\nHe then told viewers not to be too worried about the scary demand, saying: \"I mean you don't have to if you don't want to.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHolly was in hysterics, before she then joked: \"Seriously, good luck with that.\"\n\nThe hosts then got back to hosting duties, where they tried some pumpkin carving.\n\nHolly didn't initially get the hang of it, pleading with co-star Phillip to visit her house in the afternoon to help her and her children carve some for Halloween.\n\nThis Morning airs weekdays and Sundays at 10:30am on ITV.", "description": "Love Island star Maura Higgins read out the latest This Morning competition, but the Halloween theme spooked Holly Willoughby", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741992.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_281019SLUG_060mauraJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
