A Stanford undergraduate computer science student weeps into their MacBook as their code loops endlessly. Batman-style doors lift up; a tech exec tumbles out of his Model X car and crawls frantically to the nearest electric charging port. Two VC-bros poke their chopsticks at toro at the Palo Alto Nobu and discuss seed funding the Uber-of-vegan-soft-serve that Elon Musk will, most definitely, franchise on Mars. Mark Zuckerberg peers out from a manhole on the street while Jack Dorsey directs traffic around him and recites his tweets from 2006.\n\nI lived in Palo Alto for a handful of years, and San Francisco for a stint. My memories now converge as a tableau of farce, like the above.\n\nIn such a historically fertile incubator \u2014 where you can succeed beyond known measure or fail spectacularly \u2014 the air is fraught. But actually being stressed is taboo, so techies throw themselves at the pseudo-spiritual in the flashiest way possible. Silicon Valley is also one of the hungriest places \u2014 for innovation, success, domination, fame \u2014 I've ever lived. And it's also run by bonafide geeks.\n\nSilicon Valley's existence is, at once, an almost-improbable mash-up of contradictions and the obvious twenty-first century step of American innovation. Its absurdity necessitates a healthy dose of skepticism, and heavy satire.\n\nHere are 29 memes roasting Silicon Valley.\n\nWill Fischer contributed to the meme-harvesting you see below.", "description": "I lived in Palo Alto for a handful of years, and San Francisco for a stint.
