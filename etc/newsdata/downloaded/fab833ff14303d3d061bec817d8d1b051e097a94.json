If you\u2019re enrolled, iOS 13.2 should be downloadable now after it arrived earlier today for developers. It\u2019s available both for the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.\n\nDeep Fusion is designed to use artificial intelligence and other software tricks to improve the sharpness of images by capturing frames of differing exposures and merging them on its own.\n\nThe goal is to produce the highest-quality image possible. It\u2019s supposed to only work for medium to low light scenes, whereas Smart HDR and Night mode handle extremely bright and extremely dark scenes, respectively. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller calls it \u201ccomputational photography mad science.\u201d\n\nIn an interesting twist, if you happen to go looking for the feature, you won\u2019t find it. According to Apple, Deep Fusion\u2019s existence is purposefully hidden from users, and there\u2019s apparently no visual indicator that it\u2019s turned on, either on the camera app screen or in EXIF data of the resulting photos.\n\nSo how will you know whether Deep Fusion is used on your photos? Apple clearly doesn\u2019t want you to worry about it too much, as the results should speak for themselves. We\u2019ll have more to share about our own experiences using Deep Fusion in the coming days.", "description": "Deep Fusion, Apple\u2019s anticipated computational photography system, is live in the latest iOS 13 public beta.
