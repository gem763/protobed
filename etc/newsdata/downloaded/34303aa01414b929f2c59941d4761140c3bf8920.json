They face off on Saturday at Ohio Stadium.\n\nIn 2013 and 2015, the Spartans stopped the Buckeye\u2019s march toward a national title.\n\nOhio State was 12-0 and ranked No. 2 in the BCS standings when a 34-24 upset by Michigan State in the 2013 Big Ten Championship knocked the Buckeyes out of the national title hunt.\n\nIn 2015, the Spartans beat Ohio State 17-14 on a rainy day in Columbus, spoiling the Buckeyes\u2019 bid for a second consecutive national championship.\n\nOverall, the Spartans have defeated Ohio State 10 times since 1971 when the Buckeyes entered the game ranked in the AP Top 25 .\n\nIf any of that can be used for motivation for the fourth-ranked Buckeyes, Day will go with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to know the history of the two teams, and when they\u2019ve played, what\u2019s happened, and what you\u2019re up against each week,\u201d Day said. \u201cI really think that\u2019s important to teach these kids. They\u2019re 18, 19, 20 years old.\u201d\n\nOhio State (5-0, 2-0 Big Ten) has beaten the Spartans (4-1, 2-0) the last three times. This team might be the best Dantonio has seen in years. Consider that No. 25 Michigan State prevailed in a 40-31 shootout last week with Indiana, a team the Buckeyes routed with ease 51-10 in week three.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had success down there in the past,\u201d Dantonio said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if you want to be Big Ten champions or the East Division champions, that goes through Columbus, Ohio. We know that. We expect that. And that\u2019s been the norm here pretty much for some time now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all ancient history to the players.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not focused too much on last year or two years ago, whatever,\u201d Michigan State\u2019s senior quarterback Brian Lewerke said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on what we can get done this year and the offense is confident.\u201d\n\nHere are more things to know ahead of Saturday\u2019s game:\n\nOFFENSIVE FIREWORKS\n\nIt seemed impossible that anyone could top Dwayne Haskins\u2019 record-setting turn as Ohio State quarterback last year, but Justin Fields is working on it. The Georgia transfer has accounted for 23 touchdowns - 16 passing and seven rushing. The 138 points is second in the nation. He\u2019s the only quarterback in the country with a passing and rushing touchdown in all five games this season.\n\nNEXT MAN UP\n\nJoshua Alabi was a surprise starter at right tackle for Ohio State last week against Nebraska and responded with a performance that earned him offensive player-of-the-game honors from coaches. The O-line has been excellent this season. There was no letdown with Alabi, who moved over from his usual left tackle spot. Starter Branden Bowen is back this week, but Alabi likely will get playing time.\n\nMONSTERS OF D-LINE\n\nOhio State and Michigan State each have a defensive end who likely will be playing on Sundays next fall. All-American Chase Young has been nearly unstoppable for the Buckeyes, leading the nation with eight sacks and anchoring a defense that is No. 2 nationally. Michigan State\u2019s defense is anchored by Kenny Willekes , who had a season-high 12 tackles against Indiana. He led the conference in tackles-for-loss last season with 20.5 and likely would be in the NFL already had he not broken his leg in the bowl game.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ohio State coach Ryan Day wants his players to understand Michigan State has a history of spoiling the Buckeyes' plans.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mitch Stacy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/michigan_state_northwestern_football_30839_c0-153-3656-2284_s1770x1032.jpg?7c57fbc850979ff7b58d9da8432cfb1e61f1e099", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
