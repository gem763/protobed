It was a move that alarmed political leaders around the world and in the U.S., including Trump\u2019s own supporters.\n\nThe situation in Syria is incredibly complex, according to Oliver, unless you\u2019re Trump. \u201cI had forgotten that Trump spent the \u201990s as senior fellow of Middle Eastern Studies at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and not as I clearly wrongly remembered, losing all his dad\u2019s money and trying unsuccessfully to bang Madonna,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to forsake the Kurds was a surprise, Oliver explained, because they had been allies of the U.S. for years, including in the Gulf and Iraq Wars. \u201cThe Kurds fought with the U.S. military in at least two more wars than Donald Trump ever did,\u201d Oliver said. In Syria, the Kurds were such close allies to the U.S. that, according to Oliver, at one point the Kurds could call in American airstrikes in the region.\n\nTrump also insisted the U.S. leave the region very quickly. The withdrawal was so rushed that, according to video captured by a reporter who visited the bases after the troops left, fridges weren\u2019t even emptied of drinks. \u201cAmerica left the region the same way you leave a party right after you clog the toilet, quickly, leaving everything behind, and causing someone else to deal with all the s\u2013t,\u201d Oliver joked.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

While Oliver admits that it\u2019s hard to get anything right in the Middle East, \u201cit\u2019s genuinely hard to get it this wrong.\u201d\n\nSee the video above.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "\u201cThe Kurds fought with the U.S. military in at least two more wars than Donald Trump ever did,\u201d Oliver said on 'Last Week Tonight.'", "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1170549929.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1570px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
