We can pick them apart.\" (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nUNCASVILLE, Conn. \u2014 Mike Thibault had a choice to make before Game 4 of the WNBA semifinals in Las Vegas.\n\nLeading the Aces 2-1 in the best-of-five series, Thibault\u2019s Washington Mystics needed to rebound after an uninspired performance in Game 3 on Las Vegas\u2019s home court if they wanted to clinch the series. Emma Meesseman had been starting in place of Kristi Toliver as the guard worked back from a knee injury, a decision that was made in part to contend with the Aces\u2019 size. But Thibault decided it was time to get back to normal.\n\n\u201cWe just came in for practice and he said, 'Why were we the No. 1 team in the league?\u201d Toliver said after the Mystics clinched that series, explaining her return to the starting lineup. \u201cIt\u2019s because of style of play, being true to us and playing our game.\u201d\n\nWashington believed then that playing its brand of fast-paced, high-energy, fluid basketball would carry it to a win in the semifinals and the Mystics believe the same now, on the eve of a decisive Game 5 in the WNBA Finals that could bring the franchise its first league championship.\n\nAfter they squandered their first opportunity to bring home a title with Tuesday\u2019s 90-86 Game 4 loss in Connecticut, there is much at stake for Washington on Thursday at Entertainment and Sports Arena: A title would be the first not just for the organization but also for Thibault, the Mystics\u2019 coach and general manager who has spent 17 years in the league and is on his fourth trip to the finals, as well as for two-time league MVP Elena Delle Donne, who at 30 has every possible accolade but a league championship. It would be the second title in 16 months for team owner Ted Leonsis, whose Washington Capitals captured the Stanley Cup last year.\n\n[The Mystics will try to block out the noise and close out the WNBA Finals at home]\n\nA win Thursday would also secure Toliver\u2019s second title. She won her first with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2016 with a 77-76 win in Game 5 against the Minnesota Lynx. As the only player on either team to have won a WNBA championship, she knows as well as anyone that the Mystics must stick to their style of play Thursday night \u2014 and that starts with, well, a good start.\n\nThe Mystics trailed by 18 at one point in the first quarter Tuesday and ended it trailing 32-17, a cardinal sin in a series in which the winner of the first period has gone on to win every game.\n\n\u201cThe team that\u2019s been digging themselves in holes has been the team that\u2019s losing, so we obviously know what\u2019s at stake on Thursday and we have to respond,\u201d Toliver said Tuesday. \u201c \u2026 We know we can play a whole lot better and a lot smarter. Even with them playing extremely well, we were right there. We keep saying it, but we haven\u2019t played our best basketball yet.\u201d\n\nWashington made 6 of 20 shots in the first quarter and shot 44.1 percent in the first half of Game 4, numbers well below par for the team\u2019s record-setting offense. The Mystics said improving lateral ball movement before Thursday will be key, especially since an injured Delle Donne hasn\u2019t been driving to the basket like she normally does.\n\nThe league MVP has a herniated disk in her back that is pinching on a nerve; of her five field goals Tuesday, just one was a layup. Her scoring has dipped, naturally, from 21.4 points per game this postseason before her injury to an average of just 12 points in the two games she\u2019s played since getting hurt early in Game 2.\n\nWhen the Mystics execute their offense well, they have the scoring prowess to stay afloat without a big lift from Delle Donne. She scored just 11 points in Sunday\u2019s Game 3, when Washington mostly dominated.\n\n\u201cIt's about us being aggressive on offense, and playing our offense,\u201d starting guard Natasha Cloud said. \u201cWe dribbled way too much in the first half, we were playing too much one-on-one. When we started getting touches and finding open shooters and moving the ball side-to-side \u2014 [the Sun] are not a great defensive team. We can pick them apart, their rotations aren't great, and we have really great shooters on our team. Everyone needs to keep doing their role, be willing to shoot when they're open and just play like us. Just do us.\"\n\nOn defense, the Mystics said Tuesday the keys to a win still lie in rebounding \u2014 Connecticut had 13 second-chance points in Game 4 \u2014 and not letting leading scorer Jonquel Jones and guard Courtney Williams get their hands on the ball a lot. Jones had 18 points on 6-for-10 shooting and Williams had 16 on 7-for-17 shooting.\n\nAll five of the Sun's starters scored in double figures. Washington understands that one or two players are bound to have a big night \u2014 Mystics players have said they're willing to live with Alyssa Thomas going off, for example, as long as three or four other starters don't join her.\n\n\u201cTonight, everybody [on Connecticut] got a little piece of the pie and now we're sitting here empty-handed,\u201d guard Aerial Powers said.\n\nAs the top-seeded team, the Mystics have the advantage of trying to close out the finals at home. Cloud said being back in their own beds and playing in front of their own fans can only help the Mystics play their style of game on Thursday \u2014 but ultimately, Cloud believes Washington possess all the tools, the experience and the talent it needs to bring home a title no matter what.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s do-or-die time now, there\u2019s no talking about it, there\u2019s just doing it,\u201d Cloud said. \u201cJust going out, winning a championship.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nIn Game 4, the Mystics came all the way back \u2014 and nearly won \u2014 thanks to their bench\n\nKristi Toliver knows how to win titles, and the Mystics are just one step away\n\nNo one has more WNBA victories than Mike Thibault.
