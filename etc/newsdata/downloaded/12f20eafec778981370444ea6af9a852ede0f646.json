Graham (R-S.C.), who was a manager for the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImpeachment is the first step to remove a president, with the House voting on formal charges and the Senate holding a trial in which it either convicts or acquits him.\n\nMcConnell said the Senate would likely meet six days a week during the trial, lawmakers said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a planned expectation that it would be sometime around Thanksgiving, so you\u2019d have basically Thanksgiving to Christmas \u2014 which would be wonderful because there\u2019s no deadline in the world like the next break to motivate senators,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said.\n\nDuring the meeting, Graham lobbied his colleagues to consider a public declaration in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), which would describe Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky seeking an investigation into a domestic political rival as \u201cunimpeachable.\u201d Some senators, however, pushed back against that idea, arguing that Trump would assume that those who did not sign the document would be persuadable on a vote to oust him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has continued to lash out at Democrats over their impeachment inquiry. During a Wednesday afternoon White House meeting on Syria and the Turkish attacks on the Kurds, Trump called Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician,\u201d according to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). Pelosi later clarified that Trump actually called her a \u201cthird-grade politician.\u201d\n\nIt was the two party leaders\u2019 first face-to-face meeting since Pelosi launched the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, arguing that Trump betrayed his oath of office by pressuring Zelensky to dig up dirt on former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t handle it,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol, speculating that an overwhelming bipartisan House vote earlier Wednesday condemning Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria had set him off. \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t handle it. . . . So, he just kind of engaged in a meltdown.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe GOP\u2019s internal reality check on Trump\u2019s impeachment comes as House Democrats have had success securing damaging testimony from current and former State Department and National Security Council officials, many of whom are voicing long-held concerns about Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine.\n\nOn Wednesday, Michael McKinley, the former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, testified that he resigned from his post of more than 25 years last week because State Department officials were being mistreated \u2014 and because he disapproved of using foreign policy to advance political prospects.\n\n\u201cI was disturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents,\u201d he told lawmakers in an opening statement. \u201cI was convinced that this would also have a serious impact on Foreign Service morale and the integrity of our work overseas.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union \u2014 who is described in testimony as one of the \u201cthree amigos\u201d designated to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens \u2014 is scheduled to testify Thursday.\n\nRepublicans have been trying to coalesce around an impeachment strategy for weeks, lawmakers and aides say. In the House, they have decried the process as unfair and secretive \u2014 even as GOP members of the investigative committees have fully participated in deposing the witnesses.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump allies showed up to McKinley\u2019s deposition and tried to enter the private meeting room. They were denied entry, as they are not members of the House panels \u2014 and then they raced to the TV cameras to accuse Democrats of hiding investigative work from the public.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf this case was so strong, why aren\u2019t we doing it in front of the American people instead of behind closed doors?\u201d asked Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a House Intelligence Committee member who took part in the proceedings.\n\nAD\n\nThe House GOP criticism has unnerved some moderate Democrats, who began asking leaders about whether Republicans were being treated unfairly. In a letter to colleagues Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) sought to dispel those notions, saying that Republicans on the relevant committees have been included in the probe and questioned witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe special counsels in the Nixon and Clinton impeachments conducted their investigations in private and we must initially do the same,\u201d Schiff wrote. \u201cIt is of paramount importance to ensure that witnesses cannot coordinate their testimony with one another to match their description of events, or potentially conceal the truth.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans have been more blunt about their concerns over the impeachment process. During the Senate GOP lunch, for example, one lawmaker questioned how the party was going to stay on the same page throughout the process, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe the session.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s top allies moved to punish those who have questioned his actions. On Wednesday, the conservative Club for Growth announced plans for a 30-second ad targeting Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who has called Trump\u2019s actions \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nThe ad accuses the 2012 Republican presidential nominee of \u201cplotting to take down President Trump with impeachment\u201d and being a \u201cDemocrat secret asset.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTiming was a looming question in the Senate GOP meeting. McConnell said that he expected Pelosi to hold an impeachment vote by Thanksgiving and that the Senate should try to dispose of the issue by Christmas. But he also noted that motions of dismissal of the charges in an impeachment trial are handled at the discretion of the chief justice, who presides over the trial.\n\nIn this case, John G. Roberts Jr. would have the final word on how quickly the Senate could move, potentially complicating the GOP\u2019s effort to short-circuit what could become a lengthy trial.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans also expressed concern about an even more partisan Washington during a trial. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) remarked that impeachment could be \u201cnastier than Kavanaugh,\u201d the divisive confirmation fight last year over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, according to two Republicans who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was probably as much talk as anything about what will our lives be like through that trial,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nOne issue that came up, Cramer noted, was the fine line Republican senators walk between criticizing the House-led impeachment inquiry and maintaining neutrality ahead of the likely Senate trial. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who was in office for Clinton\u2019s impeachment, said that members should not weigh in at all since they will be jurors in the process.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe question becomes: How do we as a conference remain strongly united and open-minded should it come to trial, while at the same time, in the meantime, standing up for obvious injustices between now and then?\u201d Cramer said.\n\nGraham later crossed the Capitol to brief members of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise\u2019s (R-La.) team and deliver a simple message: \u201cStick to your guns, and insist on a fair process,\u201d he said.\n\nGraham said the Senate, following the expected release of an inspector general report on the origins of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, would pick up where House Republicans left off in probing alleged bias at the agency that took place in the 2016 election. Republicans have argued that the Trump campaign was a target.\n\nGraham has also promised to invite Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to testify about allegations against the Bidens in Ukraine, which have not been substantiated.\n\n", "description": "The Senate majority leader said that the trial could begin as soon as Thanksgiving and that the Senate would likely meet six days a week.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MnoEyZiM25PHYOjXLNdYy4OfZb0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UFYPYLXQNYI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
