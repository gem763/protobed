I\u2019ve had thousands of messages on social media and everyone said the same thing. Even his fans said to me afterward that they believed I won \u2013 they didn\u2019t expect him to get it. And even he looked shocked when he got it, so that says it all. It speaks volumes. I believe I got the moral victory in there, I believe I\u2019m better than him and I believe I\u2019ll be even better if I had a rematch.\u201d\n\nChadwick is keen to stay active and, after competing in Bellator\u2019s European Series events in Newcastle, Birmingham and Dublin in 2019, and was hoping to land a spot on the Nov. 23 card in London. But it wasn\u2019t to be, and \u201cThe Butcher\u201d is instead targeting an early 2020 return.\n\n\u201cI spoke to Jude (Samuel, Bellator Europe\u2019s matchmaker), but obviously the card is stacked. I can\u2019t get on there,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a bit gutted about that because I\u2019d love to get back in there and get that loss off my record.\n\n\u201cI was told I\u2019m not penciled in until 2020. So I\u2019m going to stay ready and stay on standby because I wanted to get one more fight this year, see my contract out and negotiate a better contract next year. I\u2019m working on my visa to fight in America, too, so if there\u2019s any shows I can jump on, I will.\n\n\u201c(Bellator) have been good to me \u2013 I can\u2019t complain. What happened in Dublin doesn\u2019t change how much I love the organization. That was just one of those things. I wasn\u2019t happy about it at the time, but I\u2019ve taken it on the chin.\u201d\n\nChadwick\u2019s contract situation has since been addressed, with the Liverpudlian signing a new four-fight deal with Bellator to secure his immediate fighting future with the organization. And, after hearing about the promotion\u2019s potential return to Dublin in February 2020, Chadwick said a rematch with Moore (9-2 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) at the 3Arena would be close to perfect for his schedule.\n\n\u201cNext February? I\u2019d said I wanted neutral ground because I wasn\u2019t happy with the decision, but if the worse comes to the worst, I\u2019d happily give him the rematch in Dublin in February,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting married (March 6), so I was hoping to fight in February. That\u2019s got me all excited now.\n\n\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll get one before Christmas, so I\u2019ll be staying ready \u2013 then hopefully Dublin in February.\u201d", "description": "Lee Chadwick has a new contract with Bellator, and wants the first fight of his new deal against the last man to defeated him, Karl Moore.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "Blue Corner", "Dan Tom", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/lee-chadwick-cw.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
