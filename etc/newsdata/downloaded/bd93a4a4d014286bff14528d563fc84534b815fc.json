McCoy likely would have been the team's Week 1 starter (was No. 1 on the team's depth chart prior to the setback), had he not suffered a setback in training camp when recovering from a previously broken right leg.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhile Gruden got his wish, McCoy did very little to reward him in the Redskins blowout loss to the Patriots. In his first start of the season, the veteran finished 18-27 for 119 yards, no touchdowns, and one very bad interception. Additionally, the Patriots sacked McCoy six times.\n\n\"Tough day. I don't want to paint any other picture,\" McCoy said on the offensive struggles. \"We want to score more than seven points.\"\n\nSure, there are excuses that can be made for the Redskins' poor offensive play. Right guard Brandon Scherff, the team's best offensive lineman not named Trent Williams, could not play due to an ankle injury. Starting center Chase Roullier was active, but Tony Bergstrom handled the center duties, as Roullier is still suffering from a knee injury.\n\nWashington's opponent was also one of the NFL's best on both sides of the ball. But New England's defense is especially stellar. Through the Patriots' first four games of the season, they had allowed just one offensive touchdown.\n\nBut the Redskins offense has to be better. It's as simple as that.\n\nStory continues\n\nWashington finished with just 220 net yards on offense -- an abysmal 4.2 average gain per offensive play. In the first quarter, a Steven Sims' 65-yard touchdown run gave Washington an early 7-0 lead. On the other 52 plays the Redskins ran in the game, they totaled just 155 yards of total offense. Washington converted just one third down in 11 tries, a nine (!!) percent success rate.\n\nFollowing Sims' touchdown, the Redskins had 12 meaningful drives (not including a kneel down to end the first half). They went as follows: punt, punt, punt, fumble, punt, interception, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, end of game. That's not winning football.\n\nGruden said it would be an \"unfair evaluation\" of McCoy's play, due to injuries and the play from others around him.\n\n\"We have to do a better job around him,\" Gruden said. \"For him, or any quarterback in this offense or any offense to succeed, we have got to have strong performances by others.\"\n\nBut unlike his head coach, the quarterback would not make any excuses for his poor play.\n\n\"I don't want to make any excuses for me,\" McCoy said. \"We're playing in the National Football League, and I know my job and responsibility. We were missing some guys and we're doing our best and there's no excuse for what we put out there today.\"\n\nThe ship is sinking quickly for the Redskins. They're 0-5 for the first time since 2001, and have an average margin of defeat by 15.6 points. That's greater than a two-touchdown spread.\n\nWhen looking at the Redskins schedule, the first five games (Eagles, Cowboys, Bears, Giants, Patriots) we're expected to be tough, as the team was facing four playoff teams from a year ago. But Washington was unable to escape the gauntlet with just one win, as their season is now practically over with 11 games still left to play.\n\n\"I've been provided ample opportunities to succeed around here,\" Gruden said when asked about his job security. \"I've got good players, I've got a good staff. We just haven't produced on Sundays or Mondays. We [have to] do better.\"\n\nNext week, Washington travels to Miami for a battle for arguably the worst team in the NFL. Things with the Burgundy and Gold sure feel like rock bottom now, but a loss to the Dolphins would be the lowest fall of them all.\n\nMORE REDSKINS NEWS:\n\nJay Gruden finally started his QB of choice, but Colt McCoy was just as ineffective as the rest originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington", "description": "Redskins head coach Jay Gruden finally started the quarterback he wanted, but Colt McCoy was just as ineffective as Case Keenum or Dwayne Haskins.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z8s7WhpaHYCTrQWT1yfS_A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/exxZesSaWudIn_8Lp.hVeg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnwashington.com/c6669114d40fcd6a8aade22e03770af9", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
