Joe Walsh on his midmorning Fox Business show to discuss why the ex-lawmaker decided to challenge the president in the 2020 Republican primary. Walsh has a long history of making bigoted and racist comments, particularly about Barack Obama, but is arguing that he could make a \u201cmoral case\u201d to voters against reelecting the president.\n\nDuring the exchange, Walsh pressed Varney on whether he believes Trump lies. Varney called the idea \u201cnonsense\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t lie, but instead \u201cexaggerates and spins.\u201d He also argued that Trump has never lied.\n\nWalsh: Do you believe this president lies?\n\n\n\nFox Business' Stuart Varney: No. He exaggerates and spins.\n\n\n\nWalsh: Do you believe he's ever told the American people a lie?\n\n\n\nVarney: No\n\n(h/t @EricKleefeld)\n\npic.twitter.com/NYEaaNN2IS \u2014 Lis Power (@LisPower1) August 30, 2019\n\nStu hosted @WalshFreedom to discuss his past comments and why he is running against @realDonaldTrump. \"You said, 'The single greatest act of #racism was the #election of @BarackObama.

(@Varneyco) August 30, 2019\n\nVarney\u2019s comments come amid a bit of a clash the president seems to be having with Fox News, the sister network of Fox Business. Earlier this week, Trump lashed out at the cable news network for airing a relatively straightforward interview with Democratic National Committee communications director Xochitl Hinojosa.\n\nWhile some Fox News hosts have spoken out against Trump\u2019s criticisms of the network, Varney seems to have only doubled down on a campaign talking point.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany made waves when she told CNN host Chris Cuomo that Trump has never lied to the American people. Cuomo eventually told the spokesperson that the interview was \u201cover\u201d and that her credibility had been \u201cshot\u201d with his audience due to the claim.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker, Trump has made more than 12,000 false or misleading claims since taking office.", "description": "The host called the idea of Trump lying \u201cnonsense\u201d and argued that the president only \u201cexaggerates and spins.\u201d", "authors": ["Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d697c482500004e008a07d2.png?cache=zmvgy6blmh&ops=1778_1000"}
