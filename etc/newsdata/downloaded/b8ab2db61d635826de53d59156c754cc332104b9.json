The Republican Senate Majority Leader waited about an hour after Scalia\u2019s death to say he would block then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, and Senate Republicans united behind him.\n\nNow, however, the Senate leader from Kentucky is playing his cards closer to the vest in the early days of the Trump impeachment saga.\n\nHe has made one statement describing the impeachment effort as \u201claughable\u201d but has otherwise said little publicly. He has certainly not given any clear marching orders to fellow Republicans like he did after Scalia\u2019s sudden death.\n\nMcConnell does not want to take the lead on messaging or strategy at a time when President Trump and the White House do not have a clear plan, and because there are too many unknowns outstanding.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not completely settled yet on where he\u2019s headed,\u201d an operative with deep and long-running ties to congressional Republicans told Yahoo News. \u201cThe scary part here is you have to build strategy on assumptions of what outside actors are going to do.\n\n\u201cYou want your foundation built on things you can control,\u201d the GOP operative said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Photo: Tom Brenner/Reuters) More\n\nMcConnell does not control Trump\u2019s reactions and public statements, which have been increasingly erratic. The president has accused Democratic leaders of \u201ctreason,\u201d publicly invited multiple foreign governments to dig up dirt on Democrats running for president, and berated reporters for daring to ask him basic questions.\n\nIt\u2019s also too early for McConnell to know how much more will come out of the House investigation of Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to look into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There were new revelations every day this past week, including the release of explosive text messages by former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker between the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance [to Ukraine] for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor said. Sondland wrote back that Trump had been \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that there would be \u201cno quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d and then suggested the group stop communicating over text message.\n\nAs of today, Republicans are not breaking with the president. Yet neither are they defending him.\n\n\u201cAny notion that there will be an exodus from Trump on this in the Senate is a fairy tale,\u201d said Curt Anderson, a Republican campaign consultant who is involved in the campaigns of two Republican senators in competitive elections: Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner and North Carolina\u2019s Thom Tillis.\n\nBut there are two groups of Republican senators who bear close watching. One is the handful of GOP senators who are facing tough reelection campaigns over the next year in states that are becoming less Republican, and will be under a microscope. This group includes Gardner, Tillis, Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nThe second is a small group of senators who are least aligned with Trump and in some cases openly antagonistic toward him. This is a more nebulous category. Certainly Utah Sen. Mitt Romney \u2014 the 2012 Republican nominee who openly opposed Trump\u2019s nomination in 2016 \u2014 is the most prominent member of that group.\n\nSen.
