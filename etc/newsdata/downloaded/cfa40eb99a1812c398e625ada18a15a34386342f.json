He said videos taken during the raid would be released in coming days, once they had been declassified.\n\nIt came as some military and intelligence officials cast doubt on the vivid description of the raid given by Donald Trump, who watched if from the White House Situation Room.\n\nThe US president's description of the raid included that Baghdadi was \"whimpering and crying\" before he detonated a suicide vest in a dead-end tunnel.\n\nThe officials suggested there would not have been any audio on the footage being watched in the Situation Room, nor any images from inside the tunnel.\n\nMr Esper, the defence secretary, who was seated next to Mr Trump in an official photograph taken in the Situation Room during the raid, said he had not heard \"whimpering\".\n\nHe said: \"I don\u2019t have those details. The president probably had the opportunity to talk to the commanders on the ground.\"", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's remains were quickly disposed of at sea hours after he blew himself up during a US raid on his compound in north-west Syria, Pentagon\u00a0officials have said.", "authors": ["Nick Allen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5qoe8TGmlRDvYp8qWIG5kA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/6911f30adae2550bcf575f02dbad5ffa", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
