(Image: 20th Century Fox, YouTube)\n\n\u201cWhat happens in the submarine, stays in the submarine.\u201d\n\nIn the newest trailer for Blue Sky Studios\u2019 Spies in Disguise, Will Smith stars as super-spy Lance Sterling, who\u2019s mastered the art of espionage, lobster combat and applying just the right amount of pressure to the vagus nerve.\n\nUnfortunately, he\u2019s not prepared for young scientist Walter Becket (Tom Holland), who may be classified as a genius... but still has a ways to go with the super spy technology he\u2019s developing. His latest experiment \u2014 to turn someone invisible \u2014 goes awry after Lance recklessly drinks it to test it out. Only it doesn\u2019t make him invisible.\n\nIt turns him into a pigeon.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure how \u201cinvisibility\u201d equates to \u201ctalking pigeon,\u201d but apparently this magic combo of physical trauma and Hatoful Boyfriend makes Lance the perfect secret agent to find and apprehend the bureau\u2019s latest target. With the help of Walter, of course. After all, no one would suspect a bird, especially a pigeon, considering they\u2019re just about everywhere.\n\nSpies in Disguise arrives in theatres this Christmas. Now all that\u2019s left for them to do is make a dating sim, Colonel Sanders-style, where you date Will Smith as a pigeon. I swear that would make this the movie of the year.", "description": "\u201cWhat happens in the submarine, stays in the submarine.\u201d", "authors": ["Julie Muncy", "Andrew Couts"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/hdaacuphd5qtjekg77xx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
