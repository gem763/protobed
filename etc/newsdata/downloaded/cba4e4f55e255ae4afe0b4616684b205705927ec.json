In May, she launched her own cosmetics brand, Jaclyn Hill Cosmetics, along with an initial lineup of 20 lipsticks. First, the beauty community complained about her definition of a \"nude\" lipstick and suggested that her swatches were altered.\n\nBut then, once products started to arrive, customers said the lipsticks came deformed, broken, with tiny holes, or even with mold and pieces of hair or glinting shards. Some people said their lips got swollen or that they broke out after applying the product. Hill skirted around the issue but then agreed to issue refunds, which customers complained took a long time to process.\n\nNonetheless, Hill has since returned to her regular posting schedule and said the outlook for Jaclyn Cosmetics was bright. At her annual Halloween party in her LA mansion, which she documented via her Instagram stories, she posted a video of herself showing off in her \"canceled\" costume, a nod to this year's scandals.\n\n\u2014\u1d04\u1d00\u029f\u029f \u1d0d\u1d07 \u0299\u028f \u1d0d\u028f \u0274\u1d00\u1d0d\u1d07, \u1d00\u0274\u0262\u1d07\u029f\u1d0f \ud83c\udf83 (@allegedlyangelo) October 27, 2019\n\nBeing \"canceled\" refers to being called out online for offensive behavior or misconduct. In Hill's case, she seems to not take her own \"cancelation\" very seriously. The costume she wore was a black dress with red lettering spelling out \"Jaclyn Hill canceled\" and \"she's canceled,\" and Hill paired it with a bloody makeup look.\n\nIt's unclear whether the makeup is supposed to reference to her own scandals or is just a spooky addition to the look. In the background of the video, the song \"Love Me or Hate Me\" by Lady Sovereign is playing, another reference to Hill's controversial standing in the beauty community.\n\nA few beauty community members have already expressed annoyance that Hill's costume makes light of what was to many consumers a safety issue. But her self-cancelation may even pale in comparison to the culturally appropriative afro she wore in 2017.", "description": "Jaclyn Hill threw her annual Halloween party for beauty influencers this year, and 'canceled' herself with the dress she wore as her costume.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db5e3bfe94e864d6b4cfbb7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
