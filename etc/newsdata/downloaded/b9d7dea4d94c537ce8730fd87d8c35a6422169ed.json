Show Hide To vote in a general election you must: be 18 or over on the day of the election (\u2018polling day\u2019)\n\nbe a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen\n\nbe resident at an address in the UK (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years)\n\nnot be legally excluded from voting You also need to be on the electoral register. You only have to register once, but will need to re-register if you have changed your address, name or nationality.\n\nThe forms can be completed online. You may need details of your national insurance number your passport if you\u2019re a British citizen living abroad, and want to vote in England, Scotland or Wales. If you need help, you should contact your local Electoral Registration Office. You can use this service to find their address if you live in England, Scotland or Wales. If you live in Northern Ireland you need to contact the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI).\n\nThe figure on both days was significantly above the typical number for weekday applications, which has averaged about 27,000 for the past month.\n\nParties that have traditionally drawn support from younger people will be most encouraged by the figures, which show that 58% of applications submitted on the two days were from people aged 34 and under. Many of those signing up this week are understood to be students moving into new areas for the start of term, but experts pointed out that others may have put registering on the backburner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that there will be a lot of young people in these figures,\u201d said Dr Toby James, a senior lecturer at the University of East Anglia who has authored reports on Britain\u2019s low levels of voter registrations.\n\n\u201cBut I think that there is probably a tidal wave of applications to come. We\u2019re all guilty of leaving things to the last minute.\u201d\n\nLabour, in particular, has been having conversations in recent months with groups behind voter registration drives amid concerns about the limitations in systems or names \u201cfalling off\u201d registers.\n\nFigures in the party are acutely aware that the deadline for applying to register to vote would be 27 September if a snap general election were to take place on 15 October, as Downing Street is understood to be planning.\n\nIf sufficient numbers of young voters are registered and marshalled, however, they could make significant impact in marginal seats with large student populations. Momentum, the grassroots Labour campaign, is to focus on a target list including Boris Johnson\u2019s own constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.\n\nCat Smith, the Labour MP who has been tasked with examining voter registration systems in other countries with a view to reform, said: \u201cWe will be working hard to encourage young people to register to vote, setting out our policies such as scrapping tuition fees and tackling the housing crisis.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the National Union of Students (NUS) is launching a voter registration campaign in partnership with the Electoral Commission next week and will be visible at campus \u201cwelcome weeks\u201d around the country. Alongside the \u201cGot 5\u201d campaign, the union will also be launching social media videos tailored to individual student communities to explain the importance of registering to vote.\n\nOthers have independently been encouraging voter registration by sharing links to the government website. Describing the 48-hour increase as \u201cgreat news\u201d, the actor and comedian Rob Delaney tweeted: \u201cNo-deal Brexiteers\u2019 greatest fears are new voters and young voters.\u201d\n\nrob delaney (@robdelaney) \ud83d\udea8\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde76\ufe0f\u20e34\ufe0f\u20e35\ufe0f\u20e30\ufe0f\u20e30\ufe0f\u20e3 registered to vote yesterday!

In partnership with Starbucks, the cafes aim to be focal points for debate and also voter registration.\n\nThe work comes as a debate has taken place among academics and others about the extent to which a \u201cyouthquake\u201d occurred at the 2017 general election. On the one hand, figures such as Dr James Sloan at Royal Holloway University argue that, beyond the issue of electoral turnout, there was a step-change in youth political participation, as young people were attracted in large numbers to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s message.\n\nDr William Jennings, professor of political science and public policy at the University of Southampton, agreed there had been a youthquake in 2017 but described its broader impact on the election result as more of a \u201cripple\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a historical rise in young voter participating in recent years and Labour have been the beneficiaries, but the overall result and what it did for Labour was quite small. Tens of thousands of students could make the difference across some marginals, but it\u2019s important to remember that turnout is still at a much higher rate among older voters.\u201d", "description": "Young people make up bulk of new applications, with Britain poised for snap general election", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80fd227deca6f60ff513f9dbc24c42e6699aa661/0_1837_3587_2151/master/3587.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c08e9c0dea17d58e966fb9c6e3b96f8"}
