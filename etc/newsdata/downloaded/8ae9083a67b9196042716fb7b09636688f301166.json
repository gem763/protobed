It was called Isaac.\n\nKasbar, 19, did not get far with the animal, that is native to Madagascar. Perhaps overcome with regret, or else no longer in need of a primate companion, he left the animal in a plastic box outside of a hotel in Newport Beach. He wrote a note that said: \u201cThis belongs to the Santa Ana Zoo it was taken last night. Please bring it to police.\u201d\n\nThis week, Kasbar was ordered to spend three months in a federal jai after pleading guilty to unlawfully taking an endangered species. He was also ordered to pay $8,486 (\u00a36,598.69) in restitution to the zoo.\n\n\u201cHe broke into the Santa Ana Zoo on July 27, 2018 after it had closed for the day,\u201d said a statement issued by prosecutors in California. \u201cHe then used bolt cutters to cut a hole in the zoo\u2019s enclosures for lemurs and capuchin monkeys, which enabled several of the animals to escape, though they were later recovered.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cKasbar then placed Isaac in a plastic drawer that lacked ventilation holes\u2026The next day, Kasbar abandoned the animal in front of a Newport Beach hotel, leaving him in the same plastic drawer\u2026Isaac later was returned unharmed to the zoo.\u201d\n\nAquinas Kasbar\u2019s lawyer said he made a youthful mistake (AP) More\n\nOfficials said ring-tailed lemurs are on a list of the 25 most endangered primates. They are endangered, in part, because of the illegal pet trade, according to court papers.\n\nEarlier this year, a lawyer for Kasbar, Brian Gurwitz, told NBC News his client had intended to keep the lemur as a pet and then was struck by what he had done.\n\n\u201cHe quickly realised it was a bad decision, and he took steps that night to ensure that it would be returned safely to the zoo,\u201d said Mr Gurwitz. \u201cIt was a poor youthful decision made by a high school student.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTeenager faces jail after stealing geriatric lemur from zoo\n\nUK hotel launches lemur yoga classes\n\nNearly every species of lemur at risk of extinction\n\nRing-tailed lemurs engage in \u2018stink-flirting\u2019 to attract mates", "description": "When Aquinas Kasbar used bolt cutters to snip through a cage at Santa Ana Zoo and remove a lemur, he did not steal any old primate.In a fact, be stole very rare, very old lemur, who at the age of 32 was the oldest ring-tailed lemur in captivity in the United States.
