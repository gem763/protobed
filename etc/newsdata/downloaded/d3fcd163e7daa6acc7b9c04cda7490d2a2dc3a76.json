The move, which Trump had previewed on Wednesday, will have no immediate impact until the administration finalizes separate rules to weaken Obama-era emissions requirements through 2026, which Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said would happen within weeks.\n\n\u201cNo state has the authority to opt out of the nation\u2019s rules and no state has the right to impose its policies on everybody else in our whole country,\u201d Chao added.\n\nThe administration\u2019s action represents its latest step to weaken or reverse environmental protections and efforts to combat the effects of climate change since Trump took office in 2017. Vehicle tailpipe emissions represent a major source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nDan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign environmental group, said the administration\u2019s move will \u201cmake America polluted again\u201d and ultimately hurt American automakers by making them less competitive in a global market that is moving toward more efficiency.\n\nCalifornia officials have vowed to fight in court to preserve the state\u2019s standards in a battle that could eventually be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Trump administration has been waging a multi-pronged battle to counter the state\u2019s efforts to fight climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses from vehicles.\n\nTransportation Department General Counsel Steven Bradbury said the Trump administration hopes to get a quick legal ruling and is confident of its legal authority.\n\nThe Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles (75 km) per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg (60 km per hour) by 2026 under the Trump administration\u2019s preferred option to freeze requirements.\n\nIn a joint statement with the EPA, the Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it is affirming that federal law preempts state and local regulation of vehicle fuel economy.\n\nU.S Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler speaks during a press conference on the One National Program Rule on federal preemption of state fuel economy standards at EPA Headquarters in Washington, U.S., September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\n\u2018BACK IN ITS BOX\u2019\n\nThe EPA said it is withdrawing a waiver under the Clean Air Act, the landmark federal law to combat air pollution, granted to California in January 2013 for its tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions and zero emission vehicle regulations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to put California\u2019s waiver back in its box,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nWheeler said the push for electric vehicles is hurting the auto industry as most consumers do not want to buy those vehicles, which are more costly than gasoline-powered models. Wheeler said the administration\u2019s revised standards will have a negligible impact on the environment.\n\nCalifornia reached an agreement with four automakers in July to adopt emissions standards stricter than the ones Trump has proposed, but looser than Obama-era rules.\n\nThe administration subsequently launched an antitrust probe of the companies, an action that U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California - a Democratic presidential candidate - asked a government watchdog to investigate.\n\nThe administration\u2019s move marked the latest action by the Republican president targeting California, a Democratic bastion that has tangled with Trump on multiple fronts also including immigration.\n\nOne of those automakers, Ford Motor Co (F.N), did not say if it backs the waiver but reiterated its belief that \u201cthe best path forward is a negotiated settlement that offers a workable compromise. We need regulatory certainty, not litigation.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said the planned move would help make vehicles cheaper and safer. He is counting on voters in truck-friendly heartland states to carry him to re-election in 2020.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Ford and others, declined on Thursday to take a position on Trump\u2019s revocation of California\u2019s waiver. But the group reiterated the hope that a nationwide deal could be struck avoiding years of lawsuits.\n\nThe administration said Trump\u2019s preferred option for emissions standards would hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day - about 2 to 3 percent of total daily consumption nationwide - by the 2030s but reduce automakers regulatory costs by more than $300 billion.", "description": "President Donald Trump's administration said on Thursday it is revoking California's authority to set its own auto tailpipe emissions standards and require some zero-emission vehicles, a move certain to spark a legal battle between federal officials and the most populous state over the future of U.S. vehicles.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431628784&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I18X", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
