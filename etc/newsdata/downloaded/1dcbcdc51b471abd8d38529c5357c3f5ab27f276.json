Lewandowski refused to answer many of Democrats\u2019 questions about his testimony to Mueller and often seemed to be performing for an audience of one \u2014 President Donald Trump \u2014 as he prepares for a potential Senate run.\n\nAt one point during the hearing, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) became so angry that he started yelling for Lewandowski to be held in contempt. The Judiciary chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), didn\u2019t take that action but left open the possibility at the end of the hearing.\n\nSome attendees of the Wednesday-night meeting interpreted Pelosi\u2018s remarks as an indirect criticism of Nadler, but a spokesperson for the California Democrat stressed that this was not the case.\n\nStill, Pelosi\u2019s comments come as escalating tensions between the speaker and Nadler over how the caucus proceeds on impeachment have tumbled out into the open. Nadler said earlier this week he believes that Trump should be impeached, while Pelosi remains firmly against the idea, citing overwhelming public opposition.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3808/1155968404_6087153035001_6087154269001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nWhen asked about the Wednesday meeting, Pelosi's spokesperson said the speaker\u2019s comments were \u201ca critique of the witnesses\u2019 behavior, not the handling of these hearings.\u201d Pelosi said Lewandowski\u2019s behavior was \u201cbeyond the pale and contemptible,\u201d according to the aide, adding she felt the same way about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing last fall.\n\nBut senior Democrats, including Pelosi, dismissed calls this week to impeach Kavanaugh after several liberals demanded his ouster after a new allegation of sexual misconduct during his time at Yale surfaced over the weekend.\n\nTop Democrats, including Nadler, said it was more important to focus their resources on \u201cdetermining whether to impeach the president.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Pelosi intended to suggest a specific form of contempt \u2014 such as Congress\u2019 power to hold a witness in \u201cinherent\u201d contempt and punish him on the spot, or criminal contempt, which would require the House to support a referral to the U.S. attorney in Washington.\n\nBut the pro-impeachment wing is becoming increasingly frustrated by Democratic leaders\u2019 reluctance to embrace the impeachment investigation, even as Trump does everything he can to block House oversight of his administration, finances and personal controversies.\n\nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee billed Lewandowski\u2019s appearance as their first official \u201cimpeachment\u201d hearing, one of several they are planning this fall as the panel\u2019s members determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nLewandowski is the first Mueller witness to appear publicly before the panel since the special counsel\u2019s nearly 450-page report was released in late April. Trump has effectively stonewalled Democrats\u2019 attempts to advance allegations detailed in Mueller\u2019s investigation, refusing to provide documents and blocking other key witnesses, including senior White House aides, from testifying.\n\nKyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio contributed to this report.", "description": "Pelosi made the comments to Democrats in a private meeting.", "authors": ["Heather Caygle"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/87/f5/889c526e45f1a9eabd8aa3c41a0e/190918-pelosi-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
