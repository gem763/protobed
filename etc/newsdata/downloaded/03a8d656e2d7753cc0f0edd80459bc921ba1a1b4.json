Boeing\n\nCapt. Chad Reed, Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation (PMA-268) Program Manager, stated: \"Today's flight is an exciting and significant milestone for our program and the Navy. The flight of this test asset two years before our first MQ-25 arrives represents the first big step in a series of early learning opportunities that are helping us progress toward delivery of a game-changing capability for the carrier air wing and strike group commanders.\"\n\nThis first test asset is being used for early development before the production of four Engineering Development Model (EDM) MQ-25s under an USD $ 805 million contract awarded in August 2018 in a Maritime Accelerated Acquisition (MAA) program, which aims to deliver mission-critical capabilities to the U.S. Navy fleet as rapidly as possible.\n\nBoeing and the US Navy's MQ-25 unmanned aerial refueler during its first test flight, September 19, 2019 Boeing\n\nAccording to Boeing, T1 received the experimental airworthiness certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration earlier this month.\n\nTesting of this first development asset will continue over the next years to further early learning and discovery that advances major systems and software development, ahead of the delivery of the first EDM aircraft in FY2021 and in support of a planned Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for 2024.\n\nThe MQ-25 Stingray will be the first operational carrier-based UAV, designed to provide an aerial refueling capability and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and the second UAV to operate from an aircraft carrier, after the Northrop Grumman X-47B Pegasus that was tested both alone (2013) and alongside manned aircraft (2014) from the USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) and the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71).\n\nThe integration of the Stingray into the Carrier Air Wing will ease the strain on the F/A-18E Super Hornets that currently perform buddy-tanker missions in support of the aircraft carrier's launch and recovery operations, leaving them available for operational taskings.", "description": "The first MQ-25 Stingray flew autonomously just one year after Boeing was awarded the contract for the refueling drone.", "authors": ["Stefano D'Urso", "The Aviationist"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8528162e22af68671e5020-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
