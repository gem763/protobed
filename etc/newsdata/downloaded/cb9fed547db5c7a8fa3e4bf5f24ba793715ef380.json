He stresses that the woman, who the Daily Mail has decided not to name, should not be made a scapegoat for the serious failings in the case.\n\nAlso caught up in the affair is Met Commissioner Cressida Dick (pictured on October 5 in Ladbroke Grove), who oversaw the setting up of Midland in November 2014 and who has refused to answer questions from the Mail about her role\n\nInstead he directs the blame higher up the organisation which is led by Michael Lockwood, an accountant who headed a suburban London council.\n\nLast week the appalling failures of what is now considered to be one of Scotland Yard\u2019s most disgraceful investigations were laid bare when Sir Richard\u2019s damning 2016 report on Midland, previously heavily redacted, was published.\n\nIt documented how officers made 43 major errors and wasted \u00a32.5million probing bogus claims of VIP child abuse and murder by Nick \u2013 the convicted paedophile Carl Beech who is serving 18 years for perjury and other offences.\n\nSteve Rodhouse (pictured at a barber's shop near his home), the officer who oversaw the shambles, remains in his \u00a3240,000-a-year job at the National Crime Agency\n\nYet Steve Rodhouse, the officer who oversaw the shambles, remains in his \u00a3240,000-a-year job at the National Crime Agency. Sir Richard\u2019s scathing commentary in the Mail today will make uncomfortable reading for Miss Patel, who has faced calls to set up a rigorous, fully independent investigation into the conduct of blundering detectives.\n\nThere have been repeated demands for Mr Rodhouse, described as an \u2018embarrassment\u2019 by a Home Office official, to be removed from his job. Also caught up in the affair is Met Commissioner Cressida Dick, who oversaw the setting up of Midland in November 2014 and who has refused to answer questions from the Mail about her role.\n\nCalling on Home Secretary Priti Patel (pictured arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on October 2) to take action, Sir Richard expresses alarm at the watchdog\u2019s \u2018lack of knowledge of criminal procedure\u2019\n\nThe IOPC\u2019s decision to exonerate all five officers looked even more extraordinary last week following the publication of Sir Richard\u2019s report.\n\nGeoffrey Robertson QC (pictured in London in 2015) is representing Harvey Proctor, a Tory ex-MP who was falsely accused by Nick\n\nIt revealed that Mr Rodhouse thought parts of Nick\u2019s account may have been fabricated yet still kept to a strategy of declaring publicly that police believed him.\n\nGeoffrey Robertson QC, who is representing Harvey Proctor, a Tory ex-MP who was falsely accused by Nick, said the Henriques report revealed that \u2018Operation Midland was conducted incompetently, negligently and almost with institutional stupidity\u2019.\n\nIn his article today, Sir Richard says that he finds \u2018it difficult to conceive that no misconduct or criminality was involved by at least one officer\u2019 on the 16-month inquiry, which ended without any arrests or charges.\n\nHe concludes by warning: \u2018Maintenance of law and order depends upon the effective oversight of those invested with power.\n\nWho guards the guards themselves?

Pressure grows on Scotland Yard Commissioner after her failure to publicly face music over VIP sex abuse scandal fallout\n\nBy Stephen Wright Associate News Editor for the Daily Mail\n\nDame Cressida Dick is under mounting pressure to make a full statement about her role in the bungled VIP child abuse inquiry after ex-High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques said watchdogs should have interviewed her about it.\n\nIn today\u2019s damning Mail commentary, Sir Richard insists the Scotland Yard chief should have been quizzed about her knowledge of the case.\n\nHe writes: \u2018Emails between officers should have been examined. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse\u2019s immediate superiors \u2013 Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick and her successor Patricia Gallan \u2013 should have been interviewed about their roles in the investigation, the briefings they received and their responses.\u2019\n\nSir Richard Henriques writes: \u2018Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse\u2019s (left) immediate superiors \u2013 Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick and her successor Patricia Gallan (right) \u2013 should have been interviewed about their roles in the investigation\n\nWhen full humiliating details of Sir Richard\u2019s 2016 report on Operation Midland were released on Friday, it was Dame Cressida\u2019s deputy, Sir Stephen House, who made a Press statement about the case and fielded questions from the media.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Commissioner was at an annual memorial service for a murdered police officer elsewhere in London but sources pointed out that it was her force\u2019s decision to release the report on Friday morning.\n\nYesterday the Sunday Telegraph reported claims that she had been \u2018washing her hands\u2019 of her force\u2019s handling of the VIP sex ring allegations.\n\nA senior Government source was quoted as saying: \u2018It\u2019s clear that the report raises serious questions about leadership, yet the public have heard very little from Cressida Dick on this, which has worried people in senior levels of the Government.\n\nWhen full humiliating details of Sir Richard\u2019s 2016 report on Operation Midland were released on Friday, it was Dame Cressida\u2019s deputy, Sir Stephen House (pictured), who made a Press statement about the case and fielded questions from the media\n\n\u2018There are concerns that she has washed her hands of this.\u2019\n\nDame Cressida was an Assistant Commissioner in charge of specialist crime and operations in the Met in October 2014 when \u2018Nick\u2019 \u2013 real name Carl Beech \u2013 was interviewed at length about outlandish allegations he made.\n\nHe claimed the heads of MI5 and MI6 used him as a human dartboard, a former spy chief kidnapped his dog and D-Day hero Lord Bramall fraternised with pervert DJ Jimmy Savile and ordered him to eat his own vomit.\n\nHe also falsely alleged former prime minister Ted Heath and ex-Home Secretary Leon Brittan were in a gang that murdered three boys, and he was tortured with snakes and wasps.\n\nDame Cressida oversaw the setting up of Operation Midland under DAC Rodhouse in November 2014, and was also in post a month later when a senior detective described Nick as giving a \u2018credible and true\u2019 account.\n\n'Nick' the fantasist also falsely alleged former prime minister Ted Heath and ex-Home Secretary Leon Brittan were in a gang that murdered three boys, and he was tortured with snakes and wasps\n\nCarl Beech claimed the heads of MI5 and MI6 used him as a human dartboard, a former spy chief kidnapped his dog and D-Day hero Lord Bramall (pictured outside his home in Hampshire in 2013) fraternised with pervert DJ Jimmy Savile and ordered him to eat his own vomit\n\nDame Cressida was an Assistant Commissioner in charge of specialist crime and operations in the Met in October 2014 when \u2018Nick\u2019 \u2013 real name Carl Beech \u2013 was interviewed at length about outlandish allegations he made. Pictured during a visit to Brixton\n\nScotland Yard confirmed Dame Cressida was not interviewed by Sir Richard as part of his 2016 investigation into Operation Midland.\n\nHe was not made aware of her crucial role overseeing the early stages of the investigation, as she had left to join the Foreign Office by the time he was commissioned to write his report. She rejoined the Met later.\n\nHer name did not feature in his report and her involvement overseeing Operation Midland was not widely known until last month when the Daily Mail revealed details of her links.\n\nFormer Tory MP Harvey Proctor (pictured on the BBC this week), who was falsely accused of serial murder by Beech, 51, has alleged Dame Cressida neglected her duty\n\nA Met spokesman confirmed she had received briefings on the operation. Former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, who was falsely accused of serial murder by Beech, 51, has alleged Dame Cressida neglected her duty.\n\nSenior MPs on the home affairs select committee have indicated they will press for her to appear in front of them to answer questions on her role.\n\n10 Questions this officer must answer\n\nEx-yard Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse was in charge of the disastrous sex abuse probe sparked by fantasist Carl Beech, also known as \u2018Nick\u2019.\n\nToday he has a top job at the National Crime Agency after he was cleared in four months by police watchdogs without even being interviewed.\n\nHere are the questions ex-judge Sir Richard Henriques says he should have been asked...\n\n1 Why did you not read either Carl Beech\u2019s police interviews or his blogs, and how was it possible to accurately assess his credibility without considering them?\n\n2 Why did you agree with Det Supt Kenny McDonald in saying that \u2018If asked we will say that we do believe Nick (Beech)\u2019 when neither of you had met Beech or read his interviews and blogs?\n\n3 Why on that same day did you write in a log that a full investigation was required to establish Beech\u2019s credibility?\n\nWhy did you agree with Det Supt Kenny McDonald (pictured) in saying that \u2018If asked we will say that we do believe Nick (Beech)\u2019 when neither of you had met Beech or read his interviews?\n\n4 Having concluded that it was inappropriate for Mr McDonald to have used the words \u2018credible and true\u2019 to publicly describe Beech\u2019s allegations, what steps did you take either immediately or thereafter to correct his error?\n\n5 Did you consult or communicate with your immediate superior at the time, Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, concerning Mr McDonald\u2019s error and possible means of correcting it?\n\n6 Why did the error remain uncorrected and in the public domain from December 18, 2014, until corrected on September 21, 2015?\n\n7 Was it appropriate for you to authorise the applications for search warrants for the homes of Lord Bramall, Harvey Proctor and the late Lord Brittan having not read any police interview with Beech or his blogs?\n\n8 Why did you not review the applications before they were presented to court?\n\n9 The district judge relied on the fact that the applications had been considered at deputy assistant commissioner level. Having read no interview, no blog and no application, was your oversight sufficient and responsible?\n\n10 Why, when Operation Midland ended, did you state \u2018we have found no evidence of Nick (Beech) wilfully misleading the investigation team or perverting the course of justice\u2019? This is singularly inaccurate as Beech\u2019s subsequent convictions demonstrate.\n\nLamentable. Inadequate. Inexcusable: SIR RICHARD HENRIQUES blasts the police watchdog who ruled not ONE officer should be punished over the scandal\n\nBy Sir Richard Henriques\n\nThe tardy publication of the Independent Office for Police Conduct report exonerating all five officers involved in the application for search warrants at the homes of Lord Bramall, Lady Brittan and Harvey Proctor should give rise to the most serious public disquiet.\n\nWhilst all five, absent any proper investigation, must be presumed innocent, the responsibility of the IOPC was to carry out a high quality investigation in a timely manner.\n\nThe delay in reaching their findings of almost three years is gross and inexcusable and goes some way to inhibiting any further investigation.\n\nThe source, Carl Beech (pictured being interviewed in 2016), was described as having remained consistent \u2018and he is felt to be a credible witness who is telling the truth\u2019\n\nThe investigative process itself was minimal, unprofessional and the decision-making was flawed. The complaint was referred by the then Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, at my request, to the police watchdog, then named the IPCC, in November 2016.\n\nI had concluded the search warrants had been obtained unlawfully and I called for a vigorous investigation into the decision to apply for them.\n\nNo such vigorous investigation has taken place. Neither Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse nor Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald have been asked a single question in interview as \u2018subjects\u2019 (potential suspects) \u2013 written answers having been accepted without questioning.\n\nBoth were exonerated within four months and were later interviewed as potential witnesses against the more junior officers.\n\nThe complaint was referred by the then Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured in 2017)\n\nA decision was taken to investigate all five officers for misconduct as opposed to gross misconduct or criminal conduct, notwithstanding the fact that false documentation had been placed before a district judge on oath, in order to obtain the warrants.\n\nTheir source, Carl Beech, was described as having remained consistent \u2018and he is felt to be a credible witness who is telling the truth\u2019.\n\nBut he had not remained consistent and officers failed to disclose seven factors that undermined his credibility.\n\nBoth Detective Inspector Alison Hepworth (left) and Detective Sergeant Eric Sword (right) submitted written answers to questions which were accepted with no cross examination\n\nThe investigation of the three more junior officers proceeded so slowly that all of them had retired by the time any decision was reached. Had disciplinary measures been ordered they could no longer have been imposed.\n\nBoth Detective Inspector Alison Hepworth and Detective Sergeant Eric Sword submitted written answers to questions which were accepted with no cross examination.\n\nThe only officer to be questioned face to face was Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway who by reason of the passage of time \u2018was unable to recollect what information was available at what time\u2019.\n\nDAC Rodhouse (pictured) and DCI Tudway in particular had numerous difficult questions to answer. In the context of these facts it is crucial to observe the presumption of innocence\n\nNo attempt was made to establish what material was available to each officer. This could have been simply achieved by reference to available logs and other documentation. It follows that no effective interrogation of any officer was carried out.\n\nHaving agreed with Sir Bernard on October 31, 2016, that this matter should be investigated by the IPCC, I anticipated contact from a senior watchdog official in the early stages of its inquiry, to question me in detail about my concerns over the officers\u2019 conduct.\n\nI was not contacted until July 2018 \u2013 20 months later \u2013 when the \u2018lead investigator\u2019 asked me to make a statement by telephone.\n\nShe informed me she had no legal training, was not fully aware of the process for obtaining warrants and initial attempts to create a statement failed. I agreed to write my own statement and submitted it electronically.\n\nI was shocked to learn that the two most senior officers in Operation Midland \u2013 DAC Rodhouse and DSU McDonald \u2013 had been exonerated more than a year earlier and that \u2018mere misconduct\u2019 was being investigated in preference to gross misconduct or criminal misconduct.\n\nDAC Rodhouse\u2019s immediate superiors, then Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick (pictured in August as No 10 Downing Street) and her successor Patricia Gallan, should have been interviewed about their roles in the investigation, the briefings they received and their responses\n\nIn the final paragraph of my report on Operation Midland I wrote: \u2018At the conclusion of my interview with the officers on 16/17 August 2016, I formed the view that notwithstanding the many mistakes I have enumerated above (43), the officers had conducted the investigation in a conscientious manner and with propriety and honesty.\u2019\n\nIt appears that the IOPC used these words to justify their findings exculpating all five officers.\n\nIn the preceding paragraphs I had called for a vigorous investigation to be conducted by those with appropriate investigative powers. Prior to any such investigation the officers were presumed to be innocent. Such presumption may or may not have survived a full and proper investigation.\n\nNo \u2018subject\u2019 is to be tried for misconduct or criminal conduct without proper investigation. My concluding observation should not have been used as a basis for failing to carry out a high quality and timely investigation.\n\nI did not have the authority to carry out any disciplinary investigation myself. Written responses from four of the officers should have been tested by cross examination. All five officers should have been interviewed and cross examined.\n\nJunior officers should have been interviewed before the senior officers were exonerated.\n\nThe only officer to be questioned face to face was Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway (pictured on November 11, 2014)\n\nThere is no justification for the officer in charge of Operation Midland, DAC Rodhouse, to have been exonerated after four months, more than two years before the junior officers were cleared.\n\nOther Midland officers should have been interviewed. Emails between officers should have been examined.\n\nDAC Rodhouse\u2019s immediate superiors, then Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick and her successor Patricia Gallan, should have been interviewed about their roles in the investigation, the briefings they received and their responses.\n\nDAC Rodhouse and DCI Tudway in particular had numerous difficult questions to answer. In the context of these facts it is crucial to observe the presumption of innocence.\n\nIt is possible that senior officers delegated the drafting, reviewing and presentation of the search warrant applications to fully informed junior officers who were responsible for the errors.\n\nIt is also possible the senior officers knew full well that no judge would grant the applications if they were accurately drafted setting out the undermining factors \u2013 and that junior officers with incomplete knowledge of the operation were deployed to make the applications.\n\nClose examination of logs, minutes from office meetings, policy files, weekly briefings, \u2018Gold Group\u2019 minutes, and emails would have resolved such issues and still could. I readily conclude that one or more of the five officers may not have committed misconduct in the application for warrants.\n\nHowever I find it difficult to conceive that no misconduct or criminality was involved by at least one officer. Beech was not consistent. There were numerous undermining facts omitted from the applications.\n\nA rigorous and timely investigation \u2013 headed by a serving or retired chief constable from an outside force \u2013 would have detected the misconduct or criminality.\n\nThis has been my first contact with either the IPCC or the IOPC.\n\nWhilst I have been treated with the utmost courtesy, I have been alarmed by the lack of knowledge of relevant criminal procedure. The \u2018lead investigator\u2019 readily conceded her lack of relevant education, training and experience. She should not have been tasked with this highly-sensitive case.\n\nShe must not be made a scapegoat for failings in the IOPC under its director-general Michael Lockwood, an accountant with many years in local government.\n\nIt is a matter of profound regret that one of the most unsatisfactory and error-ridden criminal operations in history should be followed by such a lamentably slow and inadequate process.\n\nMaintenance of law and order depends upon the effective oversight of those invested with power. Who guards the guards themselves? A malfunctioning police force has not received the necessary oversight.\n\nThose acting for people shamefully and adversely affected by this chain of events need no assistance from me. The Home Secretary will wish to address these shocking failures.\n\nSir Richard Henriques neither sought nor received payment for this article.", "description": "Richard Henriques says 'no effective interrogations' were carried out during the 'flawed' inquiry by the UK's Independent Office for Police Conduct.", "authors": ["Stephen Wright Associate News Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/22/19371870-0-image-a-17_1570396633708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
