The Democrats in the House want to destroy the president.\"\n\nA trail of controversy follows diGenova, who is known for pushing conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice and the FBI. He and his wife, Victoria Toensing, who own a firm based in Washington DC, helped Trump communicate with Ukraine, alongside Giuliani, Fox News reported.\n\nDuring the interview with Ingraham, diGenova pointedly refused to call the whistleblowers by the term, instead resorting to the phrase \"suicide bombers,\" which Ingraham clarified to \"political suicide bombers.\"\n\nMultiple whistleblowers came forward regarding Trump's secret Ukraine call pressuring the president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. The call sparked a widely debated impeachment inquiry, deepening the divide between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAs part of the impeachment probe, House Democrats are allowing the whistleblowers to testify anonymously - an accommodation with which diGenova disagreed.\n\n\"These two nonentities are suicide bombers that the Democrats have unleashed on the Democratic process,\" the attorney told Fox News. \"They actually think the American people are going to accept having people testify secretly without anyone knowing who they are, where they worked, what their party affiliation was.\"\n\nHe later pushed the theory that the whistleblowers are \"paid Democratic operatives of the Democratic party.\"\n\nOn the impeachment inquiry as a whole, Giuliani echoed the president's notion that it was a witch hunt, citing the Salem Witch trials and how the only time those types of trials were previously used in the Soviet Union. The former New York mayor told Fox News that this impeachment probe is \"worse than a witch hunt.\"\n\n\"The witches had it better,\" Ingraham said.\n\nGiuliani replied, \"They had more rights.\"\n\nWatch the full interview:\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Attorney Joseph diGenova condemned House Democrats and the impeachment inquiry with explosive language in a recent Fox News interview.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2836/c4918422cd124338bbb051b69e13535f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
