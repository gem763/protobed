This is just days after an epic political retreat in which May canceled a doomed vote on the Brexit deal she struck with the European Union and set off on a continental tour in search of last-minute concessions.\n\nDetails: Speaking on Downing Street, May said, \"I will contest that vote with everything I\u2019ve got.\" Conservative lawmakers will vote from 1 pm through 3 pm ET \u2014 with a result expected sometime later in the day. If May gains support from a simple majority of her 315 colleagues and hangs on, her party won't be able to challenge her leadership for another year, though her government still may face its own no-confidence vote from opposition parties in the House of Commons.", "description": "\"I will contest that vote with everything I\u2019ve got.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/2tMnZSN7JCCCVRiQmW-L7gph2fw=/0x101:3840x2261/1920x1080/2018/12/11/1544562293653.None", "published_at": "2018-12-12"}
