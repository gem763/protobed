I like exploring local bars and other ventures, because in addition to it being a time to relax, it is a good source of inspiration.\u201d\n\nWhat is the all-time best dive bar jukebox song? \u201cThe Rolling Stones \u201cPaint It, Black.\u201d It is my motivation song\u2013the sound of a good time!\u201d\n\nName the first good drink you ever drank and where you had it. \u201cOne of the first \u2018good wines\u2019 I tasted was the Chambertin Grand Cru-Domaine Armand Rousseau 1990.\u201d\n\nWhat book on wine is your go-to resource? \u201cThe World Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson. If I need some information, this is the book I often go back to. I also read Wine Spectator, which is my go-to resource to stay aware of what is happening in the wine industry and all the technical content.\u201d\n\nName the wine region that took you the longest to truly understand. \u201cThe most challenging wine region for me to understand and learn was Germany. As a non-German speaker, the appellations are quite complicated to learn and to remember.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite wine and food pairing? \u201cI had the opportunity to pair Kaluga caviar, king crab from Alaska and sauce vin jaune with a Savagnin Ouill\u00e9 from Jura. The lightness and fruitiness of the wine married with the delicateness of the seafood.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the most common wine myth you have to debunk? \u201cThe most common myth I have to debunk is that good wine comes with a hefty price tag. Do not hesitate to ask the sommelier to give you a selection of wine in your price range. In most cases, people seem to be afraid or nervous to talk to sommeliers because they have the idea we\u2019ll push expensive bottles. But do not hesitate to ask us, and the sommelier will give you a selection of wine in your price range.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite bottle of wine under $20? \u201cC\u00f4tes-du-Rh\u00f4ne Petit Ours Brun Matthieu Barret 2017. These wines are in to the true expression of terroir and fruit and elegance, without being overpowering like some other wines of this appellation.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite bottle of wine over $1,000? \u201cChambertin Grand Cru-Domaine Armand Rousseau 1990.\u201d\n\nWhat tool do you use to open a bottle? \u201cI use a waiter\u2019s corkscrew to open most of the bottles and an Ah-so wine opener for older vintages to avoid old corks breaking and dropping into the bottle.\u201d\n\nJulien Moreno is the head sommelier at Alain Ducasse\u2019s restaurant, Benoit New York.\n\nInterview has been condensed and edited.", "description": "The head sommelier at Alain Ducasse\u2019s restaurant Benoit New York tackles our speed round of questions.", "authors": ["Noah Rothbaum", "Half Full Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571863355/191023-hf-10-rounds-tease_bbiagr", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
