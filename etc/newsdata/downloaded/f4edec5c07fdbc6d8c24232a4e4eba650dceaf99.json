Is he wrong because all his candidates are black?\u201d asked the source, who asked not to be named.\n\nAn online petition called Hands Off Prof has started and a demonstration was held last weekend at Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, formerly Medunsa.\n\nThe banner for the demonstration bore the words: \u201cHands off Prof Baloyi. Join in solidarity towards radical educational transformation and activism against academic racism.\u201d\n\nCity Press has seen a thread of messages from a WhatsApp group of concerned medical professionals.\n\n\u201cThe accusations [are] always made against black academics though we know for a fact that [white academics] pass with the assistance [of] their professors,\u201d one message read.\n\nAn example was given in one message of a \u201cbrilliant dedicated doctor who passed cum laude\u201d. However, while studying towards a specialisation at Wits, she failed her oral exams with the same examiner several times until she launched a legal challenge. She won the case and is now a specialist in the field.\n\n\u201c... Do we have to suffer so much pain in this time and era\u201d? asked one academic.\n\nChairperson of the newly formed structure of concerned medical professionals Dr Phume Moletsane said he previously challenged the CMSA when students were \u201cdeliberately\u201d failed.\n\nMoletsane said there were cases in which, after the CMSA was challenged, some candidates \u201csuddenly\u201d got a pass mark.\n\nOn Baloyi\u2019s matter, Moletsane said that in 2016 and last year, he prepared his candidates for their final exams using the same method of the mock exam.\n\n\u201cAll candidates, of [different] races, passed and there was nothing wrong. Only now, when he has one black female candidate, it has become a problem. He is being crucified by people at his level who are also using the same method,\u201d he said, adding that they planned a public campaign to expose the college.\n\nMoletsane said they would also write to President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask for an intervention.", "description": "Medical academics have accused the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of racism after a black medical professor was removed from the examiners\u2019 panel on allegations of leaking final questions in a gynaecology module exam.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7079/139d4e6919374d3aa9e9ba02a19607ad.jpg", "published_at": "2018-04-04"}
