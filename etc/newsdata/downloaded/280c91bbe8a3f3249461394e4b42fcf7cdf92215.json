There's no rush,\" he said.\n\n\"Personally, I'm not concerned at all, we have military power the likes of which the world has never seen.\"\n\nSevere damage to the Abqaiq plant has halted production of 5.7 million barrels of crude a day briefly causing the biggest jump in oil prices since the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Trump had tried in vain to reassure Americans there would not be a knock-on effect. \u201cPLENTY OF OIL!\u201d, he tweeted, followed by, \u201cWe don\u2019t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!\u201d.\n\nHe warned Iran that the US was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d, although he said he would take his cue from Saudi Arabia on how to respond.\n\nThe US later downplayed the president\u2019s comments, with a White House official saying \u201clocked and loaded\u201d was \u201ca broad term\u201d that referred to protecting the US from energy dependence.\n\nMr Trump has said he does not want war with Iran, despite pursuing a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy towards the nation which is refusing to sign a new treaty that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nSmoke is seen following a fire at an Aramco factory in Abqaiq Credit: Reuters More\n\nBritain condemned the attack on the oil facilities as \u201ca wanton violation of international law\u201d but said it was necessary to determine the facts before pursuing a response.\n\nDominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said: \u201cIn terms of who is responsible, the picture is not entirely clear.\u201d\n\nHassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, clearly placed the blame on the Yemeni rebels. \u201cThe people of Yemen have been forced to respond, they are only defending themselves,\u201d he told the Turkish media.", "description": "Saudi Arabia and the United States claimed they had evidence Iran was behind the weekend attack on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities on Monday.
