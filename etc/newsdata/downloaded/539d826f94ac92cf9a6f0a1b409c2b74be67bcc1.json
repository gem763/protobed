Here\u2019s Why That\u2019s Wrong.", "language": "en", "text": "On Tuesday, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution labeling the National Rifle Association a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nThe resolution also states that \u201cthe City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County of San Francisco from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Rifle Association musters its considerable wealth and organizational strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence,\u201d the resolution states. \u201cThe National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence, and . . . the leadership of National Rifle Association promotes extremist positions, in defiance of the views of a majority of its membership and the public, and undermine the general welfare.\u201d\n\nThe NRA has since responded with its own statement: \u201cThis ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few,\u201d the statement reads, according to KTVU. \u201cThe NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans.\u201d\n\nHonestly, the NRA is right . . . \u201cludicrous\u201d is the perfect way to describe this. If the NRA were truly a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization,\u201d then it would (and this seems so obvious that I can\u2019t believe I even have to write it) have to have supported at least one act of domestic terror. (Read: It hasn\u2019t.) What it does support is the Second Amendment of the Constitution, and supporting the Constitution should absolutely never result in getting labeled a \u201cterrorist.\u201d\n\nAs a Second Amendment supporter myself, I have to say that I am honestly sick and tired of this BS narrative that you have to support whatever gun-control measure that the Left throws our way or else you\u2019re a murderer who wants children to die. Yes, gun violence absolutely is tragic, so I can understand how people\u2019s emotions about it might prompt them to feel that we have to \u201cdo something.\u201d The thing is, though, it would be a huge mistake to \u201cdo something\u201d that would take away our freedoms just for the sake of being able to say we did \u201cdo something\u201d \u2014 especially if that \u201csomething\u201d likely won\u2019t even solve the problem, anyway.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201clikely won\u2019t even solve the problem, anyway\u201d describes most of the gun-control measures that have been proposed thus far. For example: Over the weekend, Beto O\u2019Rourke announced that, if he were president, then \u201cAmericans who own AR-15s, AK-47s, [would] have to sell them to the government.\u201d This sort of proposal, as a piece in Reason notes, is one that has become popular with Democrats, including Senator Bernie Sanders. As Reason also notes, however, it likely wouldn\u2019t work. After all, similar things have been tried in the past, and they, well, didn\u2019t. In 1991, the New York Times reported: \u201cMore than a year after New Jersey imposed the toughest assault-weapons law in the country, the law is proving difficult if not impossible to enforce. Only four military-style weapons have been turned in to the State Police and another 14 were confiscated. The state knows the whereabouts of fewer than 2,000 other guns\u201d\u2014 out of an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 privately owned weapons in the state.\n\nNow, these people in New Jersey were faced with the possibility of felony prosecution for disobeying this law, and yet they still disregarded it \u2014 which makes me think that most of them would almost certainly not be motivated by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s threat of a fine. As Reason explains, it was easy for New Jerseyans to disobey this law because the state had no registration requirements for guns. Seeing as most of the United States doesn\u2019t have these requirements, either, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gun-control idea seems like more like wishful thinking than a viable solution.\n\nWhy not just make everyone register, then? Well, because people won\u2019t listen to that either \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve been open with them about the fact that the reason you\u2019re asking them to register is because you do intend on taking their guns away. As Reason notes, Connecticut\u2019s attempt in 2014 to register \u201cassault weapons\u201d achieved only an estimated 15 percent compliance rate, and a similar law in New York achieved a less than 5 percent compliance rate.", "description": "On Tuesday, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution labeling the National Rifle Association a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization.\u201dThe resolution also states that \u201cthe City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y9t0t18.kvXLjwY6Dy.uEA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/810805e6c381196d40f36c0f44f113ed", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
