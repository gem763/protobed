This time, the contact happened while we were warning the ship to sail away,\" Satoshi Kuwahara, head of Japan's Fisheries Agency's enforcement division, was quoted by public broadcaster NHK as saying.\n\nMore than 10 of the fishing boat's crew had been rescued, Japan's coastguard said.\n\nThe coastguard had earlier said about 20 crewmen were adrift following the incident, which happened 350 km (217 miles) northwest of Noto peninsula in central Japan.\n\nNHK earlier quoted Hiroyuki Suematsu, vice minister of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, as saying the boats had collided.\n\nSearch and rescue operations involving seven Japanese government ships and aircraft were underway, said a regional coastguard official.
