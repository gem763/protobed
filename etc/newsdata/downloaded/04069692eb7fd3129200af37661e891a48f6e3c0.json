However, he has also had high profile spats with the likes of James Wade and Daryl Gurney since, adding to the narrative of the \u2018bad boy; role.\n\nThe Iceman fell early at the World Grand Prix earlier this month as the Dublin crowd really got on his back and he now says it has gone too far and the governing body needs to step in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had a great year, but it has been difficult on the stage because of what goes on in the crowd, which is not on,\u2019 Price told Metro.co.uk.\n\nPrice is hoping the fans will come round to his cause (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Sometimes I can deal with it but sometimes it really does put me off. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it really, it\u2019s something for the PDC to look at.\n\n\u2018Like you saw in the football earlier this week with the racism in Bulgaria, they had two strikes and then the match would have been off. The PDC could look into something like that, the referee could give the fans warnings about it. In Dublin at the Grand Prix it was too much.\u2019\n\nPrice is known for his vociferous celebrations to winning legs, or even hitting impressive scores mid-leg, which has known to rile opponents and fans in the past.\n\nHowever, the Welshman says that this is all natural and part of his game, so is adamant that he won\u2019t be changing, in fear of it impacting his game.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to have to think about toning down my celebrations because they just come naturally, it\u2019s not like I go up there thinking I\u2019m going to do this and do that and give it the big one when I hit a certain thing.\n\n\u2018So if I\u2019m thinking about not doing them then I\u2019m not playing my natural game, I\u2019m over-thinking things and that will affect how I play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I know a very popular number one in the world who does it more than me and never hears anything about it.\u2019\n\nThe 34-year-old has tried to take measures to keep his concentration on stage, but none have helped and he admits that the crowd is a problem that could bother him again this weekend at the Champions League of Darts.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve tried earplugs but I can still hear my own heart beating and other stuff, I\u2019ve asked if I can have earphones in so I can listen to music up there but I\u2019m not allowed to.\n\n\u2018I might struggle a bit this weekend because I\u2019ve not been playing much on stage but hopefully it will get better over the next few weeks as I get used to it again.\n\n\u2018It would be nice if I could hit a nine-darter and get the crowd on my side, but then again I might just miss double 12 on purpose.\u2019\n\nPrice will take on Peter Wright in Group B of the Champions League this weekend, and Snakebite believes the Iceman just needs to let his darts do the talking to keep the crowd quiet.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think you can do anything about that,\u2019 Wright told Metro.co.uk. \u2018Everyone\u2019s got their own opinions of who they want to support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve had crowds booing me while I\u2019m throwing, it\u2019s just one of them things. He\u2019s playing some good darts, so he\u2019s not getting it as much as he used to, because he\u2019s playing well and people respect the darts he\u2019s throwing.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ll boo you one second; hit a 180 and they\u2019ll cheer, so you have to just get on with it.\u2019\n\nMORE: Peter Wright back on form with his uber-successful darts that \u2018do his nut in\u2019\n\nMORE: BDO confirm 2019 Grand Slam of Darts representatives as Mikuru Suzuki and Lisa Ashton make debuts", "description": "Gerwyn Price thinks enough is enough with the abuse from the crowd he has to deal with and wants the PDC to deal with it in the same way UEFA...", "authors": ["Phil Haigh"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1132831517_1571472512.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
