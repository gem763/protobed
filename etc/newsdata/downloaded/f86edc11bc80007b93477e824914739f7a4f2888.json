However, in February 2016, Drudge predicted early on that Donald Trump would become the GOP nominee. Warren has picked up momentum in most polls in recent months, but in the latest Fox News poll, she placed third with 16 percent, following former Vice President Joe Biden's 29 percent and her progressive colleague Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 18 percent. (FoxNews.com)\n\nHe posted the Fox News article about his tweet as one of the top stories on his widely popular new aggregation site. Below it, he included a Grabien article of Steve Bannon saying he disagrees.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, said he disagrees with Drudge. Appearing Thursday morning on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Bannon said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with Matt Drudge yet but I think if you look at \u2014 and Matt\u2019s got a tremendous sense of news, but if you look at her speech down here at Washington Square Park, which is quite dramatic, it\u2019s really Trump Lite.\u201d Bannon said she\u2019s tapping into the same popular resentment toward big government corruption that fueled Trump\u2019s rise. If she does capture the nomination, Bannon said, the race will present contrasting forms of nationalism. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re going to have populist nationalism versus populist socialism,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly defined where the energy is.\u201d (Grabien)\n\nWarren's RealClearPolitics average shows her second to Biden, with 18.3 percent.", "description": ".09/20/2019 8:50:13AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/198/5919c1ac-8629-4a0f-9bf5-b648ab337e98.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
