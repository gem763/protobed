But how much of a hit would Gates, Walton and their peers actually take?", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks at a campaign event in Austin on Tuesday. The presidential candidate has proposed a 2 percent annual tax on the assets of those worth more than $50 million. (Nick Wagner/AP)\n\nIt\u2019s Elizabeth Warren\u2019s catchy code for how little she\u2019s asking of the rich: The Massachusetts senator said \u201ctwo cents\u201d no fewer than 16 times Tuesday night in pitching her wealth tax to a crowd of cheering Texans.\n\nWarren\u2019s message was that the superwealthy, those worth more than $50 million, would pay just pennies on the dollar \u2014 a 2 percent annual tax on assets \u2014 to fund the vast array of social programs she\u2019s proposing, from universal child care to free college tuition. At her prompting, crowds recently have held up two fingers and chanted, \u201cTwo cents!\u201d to express their support for the tax, and the programs it would pay for.\n\nBut there\u2019s another way of looking at how this tax would impact the country\u2019s wealthiest families: The 15 largest fortunes in country would be, on average, half their current size if the tax had been in place since 1982, according to new figures published by a pair of economists who helped Warren write her wealth tax proposal.\n\nInstead of $97 billion, Microsoft founder Bill Gates would now have $36.4 billion, according to the figures. Rather than $44.9 billion, Walmart heiress Alice Walton would be sitting on $15 billion. Instead of $160 billion, Amazon founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos would have $86.8 billion.\n\nSome economists, seizing on such numbers, say Warren\u2019s tax could do more than just make the wealthy uncomfortable: It could erase great fortunes.\n\n\u201cThis is not some small little tax,\u201d said Lawrence Summers, former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and past Harvard University president. \u201cIf it was successfully enforced \u2014 and there are questions about whether it would be \u2014 this would be an extremely burdensome tax on wealth.\u201d\n\nThe dichotomy between Warren\u2019s simple pitch for her platform and its potentially far-reaching impact reflects a certain duality in Warren\u2019s message. She enthusiastically promises crowds she will bring \u201cbig, structural change\u201d if elected president, and she revels in reports that she\u2019s feared by the wealthy. But she also suggests that her plans would in fact require little sacrifice by the country\u2019s rich.\n\nInstead of pitching \u201crevolution\u201d like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), one of Warren\u2019s most effective political skills is framing her ideas as well within the mainstream. But as she continues to rise in the polls, her plans for overhauling the way the country allocates wealth are attracting more scrutiny \u2014 and from detractors, more criticism.\n\nHer populist pitch is largely centered on her wealth tax proposal, which would impose an annual 2 percent tax on wealth over $50 million and a 3 percent tax on wealth over a billion. The plan would raise about $2.75 trillion over 10 years, the campaign says.\n\nThe idea plays on the sentiment among many in both parties that the system has become tilted too far in favor of the rich and powerful, while stopping short of a revolutionary-style message that could alienate some voters.\n\n\u201cWhat she does well is put it in very plain terms,\u201d said Austin resident Charlie Phelps, 42, after attending Warren\u2019s 5,000-person campaign event here. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about two cents. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n\nOther Warren supporters, though, paused at the notion that the tax would have sheared some of the country\u2019s great fortunes by half.\n\n\u201cThose numbers do make me think of it differently,\u201d said Becca North, 43, another Austin resident, who was waiting in line for a photo with Warren. \u201cI would want to hear from her again. This frames it differently.\u201d\n\nNorth said it did not necessarily change how she views Warren or her plans, but she did worry that they would make Warren\u2019s wealth tax less palatable to others. \u201cThat just seems like a bigger deal. It seems like it would be less appealing to more people,\u201d North said.\n\nIf Warren is the nominee, Republicans have signaled they would portray her platform as a socialist threat to ordinary people and the American system. Former senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) co-wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday arguing that Warren\u2019s plans would endanger Americans\u2019 retirement savings.\n\nWarren could also confront criticism from Democratic rivals such as former vice president Joe Biden, whom she will face on the debate stage Thursday night, that her plans are too far-reaching and unrealistic.\n\nUltimately, Warren is betting that few Americans will be overly distraught at the prospect that titans like Bezos, Gates or the Walton family could have fewer billions at their disposal.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign declined to comment on whether her wealth tax would reduce the underlying fortunes of the very rich, as some economists say.\n\n\u201cThe wealthiest people need to pay their fair share so every person gets a chance to build a future, too,\u201d said Saloni Sharma, a Warren spokeswoman.\n\nIn her public comments, Warren is careful to say that the wealth tax is not intended punish the rich. \u201cUnderstand, this isn\u2019t punitive \u2014 that\u2019s not the point,\u201d Warren said last month at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire. Rather, she said, the wealthy benefited from taxpayer-funded benefits to make their fortunes and should repay society with a small percentage of assets.\n\n\u201cYou made it big? Good for you!\u201d she said. \u201cYou had a great idea, you worked hard . . . or you inherited well. But either way, great fortunes in this country were built using workers all of us helped pay to educate . . . You make it really big? Put a little back in so everybody else has a chance to make it.\u201d\n\nIn their new paper, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley argue that under Warren\u2019s plan the great fortunes would not be taken away, but would simply grow more slowly. Even though they singled out the top 15 fortunes, those wealthy Americans would see declines far greater than the typical wealthy taxpayer would experience, they said.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s progressive, Warren\u2019s wealth tax would slow wealth growth much more for the top 15 than for the very-rich-but-not-multi-billionaires,\u201d Zucman said in an email.\n\nHe said that many of the 75,000 families who would face the tax own barely more than the cutoff of $50 million, so a significantly smaller proportion of their fortune would be subject to the tax. A person with $100 million, he said, would have an average wealth tax rate of 1 percent.\n\nStill, for the rich to avoid seeing their fortunes erode, their assets would need to grow by more than the amount being taxed each year. Some economists say that is not as straightforward as Warren can make it seem.\n\nFor example, Warren frequently explains the tax by saying it is similar to a property tax, but one that is also intended to include \u201cthe yachts, the diamonds and the Rembrandts,\u201d as she puts it.\n\nThose types of assets do not necessarily increase in value each year, said Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. A boat, even one that costs millions, typically loses significant value each season, for example, while real estate can grow unevenly or not at all.\n\nThat means that each year, the wealthy taxpayer could have their assets chipped away by Warren\u2019s levy, he said.\n\n\u201cIt is the tax-code equivalent of looting mansions,\u201d Strain said. \u201cIf the asset is growing slower than the wealth tax is, then the asset will shrink.\u201d", "description": "Some economists say the Massachusetts senator\u2019s wealth tax proposal could erase great fortunes.", "authors": ["Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vk9lxHZUZzECGVmjAPOOE3qO5jY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ITTUI2WU3AI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
