Once the president who fired him is gone, all remaining relevance that this big scold has to the political scene will evaporate.\n\nLast night I and many others posted the clip of him telling a California TV station that he preferred to see Trump dealt with at the ballot box. That was surprising given the enormous momentum towards impeachment among Trump antagonists, of which Comey is an especially prominent example. Now here he comes to clarify that he was against impeachment before the Ukraine story broke big.\n\nSome media are quoting me from last week about my hope that America will remove Donald Trump by an election, not Impeachment. But we may now be at the point where members of the House and Senate can\u2019t uphold their own oaths to support and defend the Constitution without acting. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) September 25, 2019\n\nThe charitable interpretation of his reversal is that he realized belatedly that there has to be *some* threshold of misconduct that would justify impeachment. That doesn\u2019t mean the Ukraine incident crossed that threshold (in fact, Comey declines to say specifically that it does), but it\u2019s goofy to dismiss impeachment out of hand categorically just because you want American voters to have the opportunity to undo their own electoral mistake.\n\nThe less charitable interpretation is that Comey realizes his remaining relevance as a well-known Trump critic was about to get splattered if he stepped in front of the Democrats\u2019 accelerating impeachment train. The party has decided that It\u2019s Time and Comey can either come along or enjoy retirement.\n\nHillary has also weighed in again on impeachment today, by the way. She\u2019s clearer about her feelings on the Ukraine matter than Comey is:\n\nThe president of the United States has betrayed our country. That\u2019s not a political statement\u2014it\u2019s a harsh reality, and we must act. He is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free. I support impeachment. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 25, 2019\n\nAnd of course she\u2019s a bigger target for the White House than Comey is:\n\n.@HillaryClinton \u2013 most famous as \"Wife Of\u2026\" \u2013 is 21 years late, but it's good she's finally admitted it. https://t.co/3yS3hVXcEh \u2014 Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) September 25, 2019\n\nIt\u2019ll be a few days before we see any useful polling on the Ukraine accusations and impeachment, but YouGov is out early with numbers this afternoon:\n\nThat\u2019s a good result for Democrats but I bet those numbers can and will move *a lot* depending on how the precise question is phrased. In fact, YouGov actually did rephrase it and got a notably different result. When they asked if it\u2019s appropriate for the president to threaten withholding aid to a foreign country if that country refuses to take an action \u201cwhich personally benefits the president,\u201d the 48/19 result in the graph above among Republicans suddenly shrinks to 31/41 in favor of believing that the president\u2019s actions are inappropriate. By the same token, imagine if the question stressed that the president\u2019s political opponent really is under suspicion of misconduct in trying to protect his son\u2019s foreign business by pressuring a foreign government. The numbers who believe the president behaved appropriately would surely rise across the board in that case, and doubtless rise a lot among Republicans. It\u2019s a spin war. The better Republicans are about educating the public on Hunter Biden\u2019s shady relationship with Burisma, the less objectionable Trump\u2019s interest in seeing the Bidens investigated will be.", "description": "Of course.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/j-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
