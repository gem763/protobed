But, I went back. I was just written out for that period. If I'd have gone in playing a gay character, fine.\n\n'But to suddenly make the character \u2026 I dunno, to me, as an actor, it would've been wrong.\n\n'I don't think the public would've wanted it either.'\n\nDevious: Nick was central to some of Eastenders' darkest storylines (Pictured Nick during his first heroin addiction in 1991)\n\nHe'll never change: Storylines included the murder of Eddie Royle, several plots to murder Dot and accidentally causing the death of his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald), pictured above\n\nNick, whose mother Dot Cotton (June Brown) still appears in the soap, was central to some of EastEnders' darkest storylines.\n\nThey included the murder of Eddie Royle in 1991, several plots to murder Dot and accidentally causing the death of his son Ashley after sabotaging a motorbike.\n\nHis initial run in the soap was from its inception in 1985 until 1991.
