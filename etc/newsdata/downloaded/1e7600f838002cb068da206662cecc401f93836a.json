I am sure that on reflection all concerned will agree that this was the wrong decision and it is disappointing that the focus has been taken away from the recruitment of 20,000 officers.\u201d\n\nThe press conference came a day after the chancellor promised \u00a3750m for the first year of recruitment, with \u00a345m to be spent by the end of 2019 to hire the first 2,000.\n\nPolice leaders have raised doubts over whether there will be enough suitable candidates or sufficient training capacity to hit the target in three years.\n\nAnalysis by The Independent suggests that more than 46,000 officers will have to be hired to hit 20,000 and replace those leaving the service, while more than half of police forces are failing to meet recruitment targets.\n\nEven if achieved, the uplift would still fall short of the 21,000 officers lost since 2010 \u2013 and there are no plans to reverse the separate decline of 15,000 police staff.", "description": "A chief constable has lashed out at Boris Johnson after his officers were used as \u201ca backdrop\u201d to a highly-political speech, alleging he was misled.
