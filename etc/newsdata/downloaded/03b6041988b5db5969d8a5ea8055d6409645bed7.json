In Stall v. State, the Florida supreme court adheres to its previous precedents holding that Florida\u2019s statute criminalizing obscenity is constitutional. In a brief dissent, Barkett, joined by Kogan, asserts: \u201cA basic legal problem with the criminalization of obscenity is that it cannot be defined.\u2026 Thus, this crime, unlike all other crimes, depends, not on an objective definition obvious to all, but on the subjective definition, first, of those who happen to be enforcing the law at the time, and, second, of the particular jury or judges reviewing the case.\u201d Enforcement of obscenity laws, she contends, \u201cruns counter to every principle of notice and due process in our society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarkett does not even cite, much less discuss, U.S. Supreme Court precedent upholding obscenity laws against her objections. Nor does she recognize that there are any number of criminal laws\u2014criminal negligence, child neglect, the distinction between justifiable self-defense and unjustified homicide\u2014whose definition or application is not more objectively \u201cobvious to all\u201d than for obscenity.\n\nIn a separate and lengthy dissent, Kogan, joined by Barkett, argues that a state constitutional provision setting forth the right of every person \u201cto be let alone and free from government intrusion into his private life\u201d \u201cnecessarily must include a right of discreet access to [obscene] entertainment, writings, and other such material if the state cannot show that those materials are actually harmful to specific persons or that they intrude upon the rights of others.\u201d", "description": "1990\u2014More from Florida justices Rosemary Barkett and Gerald Kogan.
