I visited Palermo, Corleone (the town depicted in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d) and the seaside resort of Mondello. I loved the weather, the Mediterranean Sea, the people, the food and the sense of history. Reading Andrea Camilleri\u2019s great crime stories about Sicilian Inspector Salvo Montalbano always evokes my fond memories of Sicily.\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t subscribe to his leftist worldview, I\u2019ve enjoyed the irony, humor and suspense in his crime novels over the years.\n\nAfter working in Italian theater and television, Andrea Camilleri wrote his first novel at age 66, but it was his first Inspector Montalbano crime novel, written at age 70, that propelled the Sicilian-born writer to international fame. The Montalbano series has been translated in 32 languages and there was a popular Italian TV series based on the novels. He died this past July at age 93.\n\nThat first crime novel in the series, \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d published in 1994, featured Inspector Montalbano, an intelligent, honest, unconventional and somewhat dour detective with a dry wit who solved crimes in the fictitious Sicilian town of Vigata.\n\n\u201cThe Other End of the Line,\u201d translated by Stephen Sartarelli, like his previous novels in the series, offers a good murder mystery, a strong sense of atmosphere, and vivid descriptions of interesting characters, places and Sicilian food. The novel also offers abundant humor.\n\nThe book opens with Inspector Montalbano\u2019s girlfriend, Livia, insisting that he be fitted for a new suit for an upcoming social event.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d argued about this for at least two hours a day during Livia\u2019s short stay in Vigata. When she first got there, Livia, the moment she was off the plane, before even embracing Montalbano, had wanted to give him some good news,\u201d Mr. Camilleri writes. \u201cDid you know Giovanna is getting remarried in a few days?\u201d Montalbano opened his eyes wide.\u201d\n\nGiovanna? Which Giovanna? Your friend? Who\u2019s she marrying? What about the kids?\u201d Livia started laughing and gestured to him to go get the car. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the whole story on the drive home. As soon as he\u2019d put the car in gear, Montalbano asked his first question. \u201cWhat about Stefano? How did Stefano take the news?\u201d\n\nLivia replied, \u201cHow do you expect? He was delighted. They\u2019ve been married for over twenty years.\u201d Montalbano sank into complete incomprehension. \u201cBut how can a man who\u2019s been married for over twenty years and has two kids be delighted that his wife is marrying another man?\u201d Livia broke into a laughing fit so extreme that, through her tears, she\u2019d had to undo her safety belt to hold her stomach. \u201cWhat on earth are you imagining? Where do you get these ideas? Giovanna\u2019s getting married to Stefano.\u201d\n\nWhy, did they get divorced? You never said anything to me about it\u201d\n\nLivia explained that the couple did not get divorced and they were going to renew their vows.\n\n\u201cRenewal? You mean like renewing a lease on a car? Or renewing your membership in a club?\u201d\n\nSalvo Montalbano did not want to attend the ceremony and he certainly did not want to visit a tailor to be fitted for a suit.\n\nInspector Montalbano later received a telephone call from his assistant, Fazio. Fazio told him that a patrol boat that was packed with 130 migrants from North Africa, including three pregnant women and four corpses \u2014 two of whom were children \u2014 came into port. The problem was a 15-year-boy was missing. Fazio added that the commissioner, the inspector\u2019s superior, was angry and demanded that the boy be found.\n\nAfter Fazio hung up, the inspector received another call. Inspector Montalbano pretended not to recognize the commissioner\u2019s voice and asked who was calling. The commissioner, infuriated, said the missing boy was a terrorist, while Montalbano replied that he thought the kid was only a poor migrant. The boy later showed up dead, washed ashore on the beach.\n\nAdding to the inspector\u2019s woes was the rape of one of the migrant women on the boat, followed by the murder of a beautiful and vivacious blonde tailor named Elena. The inspector had been captivated by her when he met her only days before for a fitting for his new suit. She had been stabbed multiple times with a pair of her own tailoring scissors.\n\nInspector Montalbano discovers the seamstress lived a mysterious and private life. The initial suspects in her murder are a love-sick assistant and a pair of former lovers. The inspector digs into her private life to learn more about her and her past to discover who brutally murdered her.\n\nI enjoyed \u201cThe Other End of the Line\u201d and regret the passing of a fine crime writer.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE OTHER END OF THE LINE\n\nBy Andrea Camilleri\n\nPenguin Books, $16, 304 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
