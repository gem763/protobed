In a statement, it did not say what caused the crash and noted \u201cthere is no concern information could be taken from it\u201d.\n\nAn Israeli military spokeswoman said it was a \u201csimple drone\u201d without elaborating.\n\nHezbollah said they had \u201cconfronted\u201d the drone with \u201cappropriate weapons\u201d as it was heading towards the southern Lebanese town of Ramyah and it was brought down on the edge of the town.\n\nHezbollah and the Israeli army exchanged cross-border fire a week ago after a drone attack in a Hezbollah-controlled Beirut suburb in the fiercest shelling exchange between the two adversaries since the 2006 Lebanon war.\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had blamed Israel for the drone attack and vowed the group would target Israeli drones that enter Lebanon\u2019s airspace.\n\nNasrallah said while a flare-up with Israel at the border was over, the episode had launched a \u201cnew phase\u201d in which the Iran-backed group no longer had red lines.\n\nIsrael had also raised the stakes by accusing Iran of stepping up efforts to provide Hezbollah with precision-guided missile production facilities. Hezbollah denied this.\n\nHezbollah said it destroyed an Israeli armoured vehicle during the exchange of fire last week, killing and wounding those inside, and it broadcast what it said was footage of two missiles hitting a moving vehicle.\n\nIsrael said it had faked soldier injuries to dampen any inclination of Hezbollah to escalate hostilities.\n\nNasrallah said their attack had marked the first such Hezbollah operation in a long time targeting Israel in positions across the border, not in the Israeli-occupied Shebaa farms.\n\nThe latest tension came after Hezbollah, whose forces have fought in support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s war, said two of its men were killed in an Israeli strike in Syria late last month.\n\nIsrael said its attack in Syria thwarted an Iranian-led drone strike against it.\n\nAny new war between Israel and Hezbollah would raise the risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East, where Iran has defied U.S. attempts to force it to renegotiate a 2015 nuclear deal it reached with world powers.\n\nAt the same time, Israel is alarmed by Iran\u2019s growing influence in the region through militia allies such as Hezbollah in countries such as Syria.", "description": "Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah downed an Israeli unmanned aircraft on Monday outside a southern Lebanese town after it crossed the border, the movement said in a statement.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
