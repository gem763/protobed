They\u2019re too gutless to even admit their own mistakes. Mistakes which cost lives with Irma and could have cost lives with Dorian.\u201d\n\nAs these errors in predictions \u2013 and pathetic excuses -- continue to occur, now seems to be the perfect time to talk about the hype, politics, business models and created panic associated with \u201cHurricane, Inc.\u201d\n\nI say that as someone who lives in Florida and two years ago, had the eye of Hurricane Irma go directly over my home with 120 MPH gusts and blinding rain.\n\nWhen Irma did appear two years ago, Rush Limbaugh rightfully questioned the motivations of certain media and weather sites with regard to their hype, accuracy, and ultimately, political motivations.\n\nBefore Dorian even came close to landfall anywhere in the U.S., many on the left were using the hurricane to politically target President Trump.\n\nTragically, as we have witnessed too many times in the past, hurricanes can be, and are, deadly storms which leave swaths of unimagined carnage and heartache in their wake.\n\nIt is for that reason that they should never be used to advance political or business agendas, or their tracks turned into a ghoulish guessing game for ratings.\n\nAll of which create undue stress and real panic in those who may be in the eventual path.\n\nAnd yet, all three of those shameful scenarios happen with each and every hurricane.\n\nFirst, \u201cHurricane, Inc.\u201d\n\nThere are dollars in those winds. Lots and lots of dollars.\n\nYears ago, I sat down with the general manager of a major television news station. He flat-out described the evening weather forecast as the \u201ccash cow\u201d for the station.\n\nHe said their own internal surveys showed that viewers tuned in their channel for \u201cweather first, sports second, and news, dead last.\u201d\n\nHe further described their own weather forecasting as a \u201csham.\u201d He stressed that decades ago, they would give a one-day forecast. But then station \u201cB\u201d across town went to a two-day forecast. So they went to a three-day forecast until all stations now give \u201cuseless seven-day forecasts.\u201d\n\nHe admitted the seven-day forecast was \u201calmost always wrong\u201d but still put up for reasons of competition and ratings.\n\nThese same weather business and competition models apply to the major networks, cable networks, and newspapers. At one time or another, most are guilty of hyping hurricanes for profit.\n\nNext, leaving the smearing of President Trump aside, the fact is, many on the left use the hype and potentially deadly destruction of hurricanes to push their particular global warming and climate change narratives.\n\nNo surprise since, just like the mainstream media, the entertainment world, and academia, the media club of meteorologists discriminates against conservative or even pragmatic and honest thought when it comes to their hiring practices.\n\nIf you don\u2019t worship at the altar of their \u201cScience is settled\u201d on global warming narrative, chances are, you will never be hired.\n\nBeyond that, we have the multi-colored spaghetti models slapped all over our screens every time a hurricane appears.\n\nThey, and the breathless forecasters pointing to them, do get our attention, but for all the wrong reasons.\n\nThe right reason being they are often wrong.\n\nDisturbingly, the errors in these predictions can and do produce horrific consequences.\n\nIt has been well documented that the \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d \u201cMonster,\u201d and \u201chistoric\u201d winds hyped non-stop are regularly dramatically less when the hurricane makes landfall. And yet\u2026why waste a click-bait marketing or political opportunity?\n\nWith regard to Irma two years ago, basically every spaghetti model on the screen \u2013 along with the cones -- proved to be decidedly inaccurate. First, they had Irma going to the east coast of Florida; then just off the coast; then, more to the middle of the state; then, more to the west, then over the west coast of Florida.\n\nThat particular etch-a-sketch of noodles proving hurricane forecasting is far from an exact science and often a joke\u2026on us.\n\nA forecaster on CNN was ultimately so bothered by the ever-changing predictions, that he called the models \u201chorrible.\u201d\n\nWorse than horrible, they were irresponsible and deadly.\n\nThe entire east coast of Florida from Miami to Palm Beach was under mandatory evacuation orders. Millions of people were forced to flee creating great hardship for the elderly and the infirm.\n\nAside from the millions of taxpayer dollars spent to enforce the evacuation, there were numerous accidents on the highways with some resulting in fatalities.\n\nMost alarmingly of all, many of the people who fled the east coast of Florida went to the \u201csafety\u201d of the Naples, Fort Myers area on the west coast.\n\nPrecisely where Irma made landfall and unfurled her full devastation.\n\nAs a weakening Dorian spins up the Atlantic and forecasters keep crossing out their previous predictions, we should never lose sight of the two major lessons regarding hurricanes:\n\nThe first being that all should be taken extremely seriously, and every precaution must be made well in advance of potential landfall.\n\nThe second lesson being that hurricanes must never be exploited for political reasons, monetary gain, or ratings.\n\nReal lives are at stake and the human beings in the path of one of these killers should never be used as cheap theatrical pawns.", "description": "\u201cThese weather forecasters are irresponsible guessers putting real lives in .10/02/2019 13:14:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Douglas Mackinnon", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/295/7521a77b-1943-47e9-8442-6f53135feb6f.jpg"}
