A few people may have heard whispers that George and Russell Westbrook had a wandering eye, but nobody was talking about it seriously.\n\nNobody saw the Clippers swinging the trade to get George \u2014 which Kawhi Leonard told them they needed to do to get him, too \u2014 coming.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt was such a wild trade that was off and on several times over the course of the day it went down, something Clippers\u2019 coach Doc Rivers explained on the Rich Eisen Show. Listen to the whole clip (above), but here is the money part:\n\n\u201cWe knew we were close. I can tell you on the day that it all went down, at 10 that morning, we thought the deal was over, that it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Because Oklahoma and us, we just couldn\u2019t get a deal done. At two, we thought it was back on. At five, Lawrence [Frank, Clippers president] said \u2018Hey, it\u2019s over. We can all just go to dinner.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd so I was on my way to dinner, I was literally walking into Nobu in Malibu and I get a text, \u2018Grab your phone, it\u2019s back on.\u2019 Within an hour, the deal was done.\u201d\n\nRivers also confirms that Leonard\u2019s people told the Clippers they needed \u201cto add to the roster\u201d without giving up too much. Whether they gave up too much long term is up for debate (and how well the Clippers play the next couple of seasons, if they can make the Finals or win a title, will color that discussion). They gave up a good young player in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander plus a boatload of draft picks.\n\nThey had to if they wanted to make the bold play of a contender.\n\nAnd those kinds of moves tend to be chaotic.", "description": "\"At 2, we thought it was back on.
