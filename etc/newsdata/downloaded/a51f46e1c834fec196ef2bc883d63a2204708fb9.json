In the meantime, the company is managing their cost base with \"extra discipline\".\n\n\"That means asking: if someone leaves business, does that role get replaced immediately? Or can we wait a few months? Do we need to spend [the] same amount on travel and other discretionery costs? And so on,\" he said.\n\nShares in Southern Cross fell 23 per cent to their lowest level since 2014, following the update on Tuesday.\n\nUBS analysts Eric Choi, Tom Beadle and Minnie Tong cut their 12-month share price target to $1.15 from $1.25 following the announcement, while retaining their 'neutral' rating on the stock.\n\n\"In terms of divisional colour, [Southern Cross Media Group] did not provide an explicit update. However, Commercial Radio Australia data also released today suggests metro radio markets were down -10.2 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter,\" they wrote in an analyst note.\n\n\"Southern Cross Media Group indicated it was trading broadly in line with the metro radio market. This then infers Southern Cross Media Group's regional radio revenues are likely performing slightly better than the overall group, though likely still experiencing negative year on year growth.\"\n\nThe analysts cut their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the 2020 financial year by about 7 per cent, and reduced their earnings per share by 11 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey said \"implicit\" in their assumptions was their prediction that Southern Cross Media would deliver \"relatively flat half-on-half revenue outcome\" for the second half of the financial year compared to the first half.\n\nJane Ractliffe, the Standard Media Index managing director for Australian and New Zealand, confirmed that the ad market in general contracted across the first quarter by about 8.6 per cent from the previous year. SMI collects data and tracks ad spend in the marketplace.\n\n\"The first quarter of the financial year brings to 12 the number of monthly declines reported by SMI, but we're now forecasting the market to return to growth in October, as we see signs of growth in the data. So, we think that this quarter just reported is the end of the cyclical downturn,\" said Ms Ractliffe.", "description": "Southern Cross Media's shares plunged 20 per cent after the company's ad spend missed expectations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5295%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e8f80a9116fa32198f2a05debc002aa08538b2c1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
