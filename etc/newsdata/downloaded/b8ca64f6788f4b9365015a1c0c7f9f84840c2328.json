Shortly after they were shot, the videos were posted on the internet, on massively popular websites like Pornhub and YouPorn, and the women were doxed and harassed by viewers using forums like the recently-defunct PornWikiLeaks.\n\nAccording to NBC 7 in San Diego, where the trial has been underway in San Diego Superior Court for two weeks, videographer Theodore \"Teddy\" Gyi said in his testimony that he was instructed by the Girls Do Porn owners to tell women that the videos he shot would never appear online. He also testified to hearing actor and director Ruben \u201cAndre\u201d Garcia tell the women numerous times that it the videos would be available on DVD only, in Australia.\n\nIn a video deposition taken on January 22 as part of Wolfe's bankruptcy proceedings, Gyi confirmed that he heard Garcia tell women that the videos that they shot would not be posted on the Internet, \"maybe five to 10 times,\" he said.\n\nGyi is also named in July court documents as someone Girls Do Porn hired to film girl-boy scenes for the company while the primary photographer and part-owner, Matthew Wolfe, focused on recruiting and filming for their spinoff company, Girls Do Toys (solo sex scenes, as opposed to the scenes with a male actor). \"Mr. Gyi was present in the hotel room for many shoots,\" the plaintiff's trial brief states. \"However, Garcia would often ask him to leave the room while Garcia paid the models and presented the contracts.\"\n\nThis testimony is hugely important to the plaintiffs' case, as Gyi is one of only a few people who was present at the filming but wasn't one of the Girls Do Porn founders. It corroborates the stories of multiple women\u2014plaintiffs in the case as well as women Motherboard spoke with directly\u2014who said they only did the videos with the assurance of the director and owners that these images would be isolated to adult stores on the other side of the world.\n\n\u201cHe said it would be 30 minutes of having sex, it would be $5,000,\" one of the women testified in court, according to NBC 7, referring to either Pratt or Garcia. \"...He repeatedly said not online, not online, he said the videos would be on DVDs in Australia and other countries. I asked if I could do other modeling and he said no.\"\n\nLast month, Motherboard uncovered a pattern of doxing and harassment that targeted these women once this promise was broken and the videos spread online. Some of the videos on Pornhub, posted to the official Girls Do Porn channel that Pornhub partnered with and publicly promoted for years, reached tens of millions of views. Following Motherboard's reporting, Pornhub removed some of the videos that featured plaintiffs\u2014and as of last week, the site removed Girls Do Porn logos from its partners page.", "description": "The porn production company is being sued by 22 women, who claim that they were told their videos wouldn't appear online.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d6e9ce8fffff30008de132b/lede/1567531579633-girl-do-porn_3-2.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
