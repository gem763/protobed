Or the one who murdered nine black parishioners in Charleston in 2015. Or the one who killed eleven Jewish worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue last year\u2014the deadliest anti-Semitic massacre in the history of the republic. Anti-Semitic hate crimes recently surged to some of their highest recorded levels in the last 40 years.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more urgent threat to the free exercise of religious beliefs than these attacks. I don\u2019t doubt that Barr is troubled by them. But their omission from his narrative simply underscores that his concern isn\u2019t so much about the future of religious liberty, but the future of Christian hegemony in American public life.\n\nThat concern is somewhat well-founded. A Pew Research Center report released last Friday found that the percentage of Americans who identify as Christians now stands at 65 percent, a 12 percent drop from 2009. That decline is matched by a 17 percent rise in Americans without a religious affiliation, who now make up 26 percent of the population. By focusing on the immediate political context, Krugman missed the deeper social and cultural currents that animate not only Barr\u2019s remarks, but similar fears throughout the religious right.\n\n\u201cToday, 62 percent of Christians say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month, which is identical to the share who said the same in 2009,\u201d Pew reported. \u201cIn other words, the nation\u2019s overall rate of religious attendance is declining not because Christians are attending church less often, but rather because there are now fewer Christians as a share of the population.\u201d The generational divides are even more stark: Pew found that 84 percent of the Silent Generation and 76 percent of baby boomers describe themselves as Christian, while only 49 percent of millennials do so.\n\nThose figures help explain why Barr devoted so much of his attention to education. \u201cTo me, this is the most serious challenge to religious liberty,\u201d he said. \u201cFor anyone who has a religious faith, by far the most important part of exercising that faith is the teaching of that religion to our children. The passing on of the faith. There is no greater gift we can give our children and no greater expression of love. For the government to interfere in that process is a monstrous invasion of religious liberty.\u201d\n\nTo that end, he criticized New Jersey and other states for requiring \u201can LGBT curriculum that many feel is inconsistent with traditional Christian teaching,\u201d especially if parents can\u2019t opt out. He lambasted state legislatures that don\u2019t want to send taxpayer funds to private religious schools. And he said the Justice Department would intervene on behalf of the Catholic archdiocese in Indianapolis in a lawsuit brought by a Catholic school teacher who was fired for marrying her wife. \u201cIf these measures are successful, those with religious convictions will become still more marginalized,\u201d he warned.\n\n\n\nOther high-profile violations of religious liberty in recent years went unmentioned. It\u2019s not surprising that he didn\u2019t cite the Muslim ban that President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail and imposed in office with the Supreme Court\u2019s assent. Nor did he cite the Justice Department\u2019s intervention two years ago on behalf of a Virginia Muslim community that couldn\u2019t obtain a permit to build a mosque. This spring, the justices even refused to delay the execution of a Muslim death-row prisoner in Georgia while he challenged a state policy that allowed a Protestant Christian minister to be in the execution chamber during the process, but not the clergy of his own faith.\n\nThe common thread that runs through Barr\u2019s speech is power.\n\nThe common thread that runs through Barr\u2019s speech is power. In his telling, those who undermine Christianity\u2019s preeminent status in American society are the one who wield and abuse it. \u201cThe problem is not that religion is being forced on others,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that irreligion and secular values are being forced on people of faith. This reminds me of how some Roman emperors could not leave their loyal Christian subjects in peace but would mandate that they violate their conscience by offering religious sacrifice to the emperor as a god.\u201d\n\nThat comparison is enlightening, though not in the way Barr intended. The attorney general is not an unarmed prisoner staring down a lion in the Colosseum; he is one of the emperor\u2019s most powerful magistrates. The Trump administration is a living testament to the Christian right\u2019s political power in 21st century America. And while Trump himself is not known for adhering to a Christian moral code, he has staffed his administration with figures like Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and other religious conservatives who shape public policy every day.\n\nBarr noted that the previous administration took a different approach. He cited the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to enforce the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate on Christian-led companies and organizations that invoked religious-freedom claims. What he left out is that those groups have largely triumphed in the courts. The Supreme Court is more favorable towards religious-liberty claims today than they\u2019ve been at any other time in the past 50 years. Chief Justice John Roberts and the court\u2019s conservative justices have handed victory after victory after victory to those claims in recent years. Thanks to Trump, they\u2019ll likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis dynamic is not healthy for American politics. Those who\u2019ve found a moral and ethical foundation beyond Christianity aren\u2019t going anywhere. And while Christians may be declining in relative influence, they aren\u2019t vanishing from public life any time soon. (If anything, the history of Christianity is a history of surviving and thriving amidst the heathens.) The only viable option is peaceful coexistence, with all the vexations and frustrations that it brings. Public officials should work to bring us closer to that goal.
