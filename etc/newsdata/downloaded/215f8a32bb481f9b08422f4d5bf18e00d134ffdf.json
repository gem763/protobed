The company has now reported declining year-over-year sales in three consecutive quarters. Shares fell about 3% in postmarket trading.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond has been searching for a new direction following missteps that left revenue lower and investors unhappy about the company's strategy.\n\nFormer executives have said the company lacked a clear vision about how to compete in a retail sector upended by e-commerce. Bed Bath & Beyond had relied on coupons to draw shoppers and left stores cluttered and difficult for shoppers to navigate.\n\nIn March, three investors in the company called for the ouster of longtime Chief Executive Steven Temares, saying Bed Bath & Beyond had failed to update its business model.\n\nHe stepped down in May and was succeeded in an interim capacity by Mary Winston, a former executive at Dollar Tree Inc.'s Family Dollar and grocery chain Giant Eagle Inc. She remains the interim CEO.\n\nThe company on Wednesday reiterated that it has made progress in its effort to find and hire a permanent chief executive.\n\nIt also has said it is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advisers to evaluate various strategic options for the company.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond reported a loss of $138.8 million, or $1.12 a share, for its fiscal second quarter, down from a profit of $48.6 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.\n\nThe retailer recorded impairments related to its transformation efforts and paid out more in severance after layoffs and moving to outsource certain functions. In July, the Union, N.J.-based company said it would reduce staff in its corporate office by 7%, letting vice presidents, managers and others go.\n\nExcluding severance, an inventory write-down and other costs, the company said it earned a profit of 34 cents a share, 7 cents more than expected.\n\nEarlier this month, the company said a refresh of about 160 stores was under way. It also said it would move to offer shoppers more store-brand products, which typically are cheaper than branded alternatives, and reduce inventories by up to $1 billion.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond has also revamped its board. Nine new members have joined the board in recent months, according to the company.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
