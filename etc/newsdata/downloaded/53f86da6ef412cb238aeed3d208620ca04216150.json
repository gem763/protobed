Now I\u2019ve made the \u00addecision not to even look as I find it\u2019s just best to get on with my job. But it\u2019s not all been negative, I\u2019ve had some really lovely messages, and people sending me their drawings of Nate.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Nate being his first high profile acting role of this nature, another thing he has found awkward is the sex scenes that have been demanded of his character and Moira \u2013 affectionately known to some as \u2018Mucky Moira\u2019.\n\nHe shared: \u2018It\u2019s been full-on since I started. I\u2019d done a few bits and pieces but Emmerdale is my first big TV role. My mum and late grandmother always watched Emmerdale so it was pretty daunting coming in.\n\n\u2018And not only was I new to the show, but I\u2019d not really done any intimate scenes before. I won\u2019t lie \u2013 a lot of the time I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by them. And you don\u2019t even feel that sexy doing them. You have so many people around you, and the boom operators who can hear every little sound you make when you\u2019re kissing. It\u2019s not the sexiest when you\u2019re doing it.\u2019\n\nAnd even less sexy tonight is the potential fate awaiting Nate, Moira and Cain as the boat they are all scrapping on explodes. Will they all survive?\n\nEmmerdale continues on Tuesday 22nd October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Fans have not taken kindly to Nate's affair with Moira.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/03_10_coro_pete_moira_nate_2nd_ep_02-8b03_1571741443.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
