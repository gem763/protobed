Wait until he's had a year at that level and then we can say more,\" Jenks told The Athletic.\n\n(Image: 2019 Aston Villa FC)\n\n\"What I do know is that Sir Alex Ferguson is wondering why Manchester United let a talented Scottish boy slip through.\n\n\"He'll be keeping a close eye on him that's for sure and if he continues the way he is, you can bet he'll be telling his pals at United, too.\"", "description": "The former Manchester United boss will apparently be in touch with the club to recommend a new signing", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Aston Villa Fc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18854128.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UEFA-Euro-2020-Glasgow-Logo-Launch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
