Buzz60\n\nTiny St. Andrews has a huge reputation, known around the world as the birthplace and royal seat of golf. The chance to play on the world's oldest course \u2013 or at least take in the iconic view of its 18th hole \u2013 keeps the town perennially popular among golfing pilgrims. But any visitor to Scotland should consider at least a short stop in this scenic, intriguingly historic university town.\n\nLocated about a one-and-a-half-hour drive north of Edinburgh, and dramatically crowning the cliffs at the tip of a peninsula jutting into the North Sea, St. Andrews has been a tourist destination for centuries \u2013 in part because of its important role in Scottish history.\n\nTo reserve a tee time at the scenic Old Course of the St. Andrews Links, you'll need to book a year ahead \u2014 and pay a pretty penny.

The relics of its namesake saint first put the town on the medieval map, drawing pilgrims from around Europe \u2013 until it was ransacked by Protestants, and its stones repurposed for newer buildings in town. Just a few blocks away from the cathedral ruins is St. Andrews Castle, which had also been largely destroyed during the Reformation. What little is left makes a fun visit for its dungeons and tunnels.\n\nSt. Andrews Cathedral may have rotted away, but its beautiful ruins \u2014 with walls and spires pecked away by centuries of scavengers \u2014 are a delight to explore. (Photo: Cameron Hewitt)\n\nIn addition to its ruined cathedral and castle, St. Andrews still retains its original medieval, compact street plan, with just four main streets that all lead to the cathedral, connected mostly by narrow, twisting lanes called \"wynds.\" (The street sign for one of them, Butts Wynd, often goes missing for some reason.)\n\nBut golf is the main draw of the town; for any serious golfer, a visit to St. Andrews means the chance to play a round where the sport was supposedly invented: the Old Course. Since the grassy beachfront strip just outside St. Andrews couldn't support crops, it was used for playing the game \u2014 and centuries later it still is. The first record of golf being played here was in 1553 (but nobody knows exactly when and where people first hit a ball with a stick for fun).\n\nPrince William practices his golf swing as a student at St. Andrews in 2003. (Photo: DAVID CHESKIN/AFP)\n\nWhile golf's origins might be a little ambiguous, there's no doubt that the town turned it into the sport we know today. Why do golf courses have 18 holes? Because that's how many fit at the Old Course. Except for when it's hosting the British Open, the Old Course is open to the public. But playing a round here is pricey and requires major planning: Reserve at least a year in advance, or try your luck in the daily lottery. The St. Andrews Links include six other courses that are much easier (and cheaper) to play.\n\nNongolfers (like me) can still brag that they've golfed at St. Andrews by playing a round at the Old Course's fun putting course \u2013 nicknamed \"The Himalayas\" for its dramatically hilly terrain. While the building housing the Royal and Ancient Golf Club \u2013 still golf's rulemaking body \u2013 is off-limits to nonmembers, anyone can take in the history of the sport at the nearby British Golf Museum, with a compact exhibit that reverently explains the game's origins and changes over time.\n\nJust below the Old Course is a broad, two-mile-long beach called the West Sands, offering great views of the town \u2013 and the chance to reenact the opening scene of \"Chariots of Fire,\" filmed on this stretch of sand.\n\nThe town is also the home of Scotland's most important university: Founded in 1413, the University of St. Andrews is the third-oldest in the English-speaking world \u2013 only Oxford and Cambridge have been around longer. The quad of St. Salvator's College, known to students as Sally's Quad, is the university's heart. As most university classrooms, offices, and libraries are spread out across town, during the school term, shops and pubs brim with student energy.\n\nThe university's most famous recent graduate is Prince William (class of '05). Soon after he enrolled here, the number of female applicants to study art history \u2013 his original major \u2013 skyrocketed. When he married Kate Middleton, a fellow St. Andrews alum, six years later, nearly the entire student body was there to celebrate on Sally's Quad.\n\nWill and Kate returned to their alma mater, the University of St. Andrews in February 2011, about two months before their wedding.

The town also makes a handy home base for a variety of fun side trips to some less-touristed spots nearby: interesting museums in the city of Dundee; Glamis Castle, the childhood home of the late Queen Mother; and a string of relaxing fishing villages along a stretch of nearby coast called the East Neuk.\n\nNo matter what brings you to St. Andrews, you'll be welcomed with a cool sea breeze, a vibrant student culture, and the rich history of this wee town.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/10/24/st-andrews-scotland-where-golf-born-will-and-kate-fell-love/4067547002/", "description": "An easy day trip from Edinburgh, St. Andrews.
