Roughly 60 sporting events at the festival, which runs through Thursday, will have on-site volunteers to assist athletes or event attendees with reporting sex crimes and seeking medical treatment.\n\n\u201cAnyone involved or related to these sporting events will be able to receive help from the center,\u201d Kim Soon-hee, an official at the city\u2019s Women\u2019s Family Policy Office, told UPI. \u201cWe created a team and a system to prevent potential incidents of [sexual misconduct], especially after the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, South Korea erupted into a nationwide conversation about sexual misconduct in sports when short-track speed-skating champion Shim Suk-hee accused her coach, Cho Jae-beom, of assaulting her multiple times since 2014. Cho is under investigation for the allegations and was separately sentenced to a 10-month stint in prison for physical assault.\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission of Korea announced a yearlong crackdown on sexual assault in sports in April, with a preliminary investigation revealing more than 30 cases of reported abuse.\n\nKim Dong-shik, an expert at the Korean Women\u2019s Development Institute, said the center is a good first step to stopping abuse in sports. Last year, Kim conducted a survey of South Korean athletes during the height of the country\u2019s #MeToo movement and found that 20 percent of players experienced some form of sexual violence.\n\n\u201cWe need this service in every area, especially sports, because sports have a stronger sense of hierarchy and rank in its authoritative power structure,\u201d Kim Dong-shik, an expert at the Korean Women\u2019s Development Institute, told UPI. \u201cIf something happens to the team, the image of the team is ruined and so people try to cover the incidents \u2026 They try to quiet the victim, which is why the problem is often never solved.\u201d\n\nJeong Seung-hee, a 25-year-old college student, empathized with athletes like Shim Suk-hee who came forward with sexual assault allegations.\n\n\u201cI felt so bad for her. By telling the truth, she decided to give up her career,\u201d Jeong told UPI. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to report sexual assault as a woman living in a conservative society, where the blame falls on the victims and women to \u2018do better\u2019 in these situations \u2026 Even if women report it to the police, it\u2019s hard to prove that they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted.\u201d\n\nMore than 32,800 crimes involving sexual violence were recorded by the government in 2017, according to the Korean Statistical Information Service. In a nation of more than 50 million people, it\u2019s possible that even more cases of assault are going unreported \u2014 and the challenges behind reporting sex crimes leaves some women doubting whether resource centers at sporting stadiums will actually be used.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think many people will actually go to this center and report sexual crimes \u2026 If they actually do report it, their careers would be in jeopardy,\u201d Jeong said. \u201cI like the purpose of the center, but I\u2019m just not sure about the practicality of it.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s #MeToo movement has reached further than the sports industry, with prominent lawyers, politicians and actors sharing their experiences with sexual violence on the national stage. In May 2018, thousands marched to protest the nation\u2019s phenomenon of spycam pornography, which includes the filming of women in places like public bathrooms and hotels without their knowledge.\n\n\u201cSexual misconduct has been an issue in Korea for a long time, but it just came to the surface recently,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt was finally a wake-up call for men in our society.\u201d\n\nPeter W.
