They seemed meant to tamp down questions about Mr Giuliani\u2019s status with a client famous for distancing himself from advisers when they encounter legal problems of their own.\n\nMr Trump, during a Saturday night appearance on Fox News, called Mr Giuliani \u201ca great gentleman\u201d and said he is still his lawyer. \u201cI know nothing about him being under investigation.

Trump impeachment: Who's who in the Ukraine scandal 1/19 Donald Trump Accused of abusing his office by pressing the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to help dig up dirt on Joe Biden, who may be his Democratic rival in the 2020 election. He also believes that Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails - a key factor in the 2016 election - may be in Ukraine, although it is not clear why. Reuters 2/19 The Whistleblower Believed to be a CIA agent who spent time at the White House, his complaint was largely based on second and third-hand accounts from worried White House staff.

Attorney Mark Zaid said that he and other lawyers on his team are now representing the second person, who is said to work in the intelligence community and has first-hand knowledge that supports claims made by the first whistleblower and has spoken to the intelligence community's inspector general. The second whistleblower has not yet filed their own complaint, but does not need to to be considered an official whistleblower. Getty 4/19 Rudy Giuliani Former mayor of New York, whose management of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 won him worldwide praise. As Trump\u2019s personal attorney he has been trying to find compromising material about the president\u2019s enemies in Ukraine in what some have termed a \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy. In a series of eccentric TV appearances he has claimed that the US state department asked him to get involved. Giuliani insists that he is fighting corruption on Trump\u2019s behalf and has called himself a \u201chero\u201d. AP 5/19 Volodymyr Zelensky The newly elected Ukrainian president - a former comic actor best known for playing a man who becomes president by accident - is seen frantically agreeing with Trump in the partial transcript of their July phone call released by the White House. With a Russian-backed insurgency in the east of his country, and the Crimea region seized by Vladimir Putin in 2014, Zelensky will have been eager to please his American counterpart, who had suspended vital military aid before their phone conversation. He says there was no pressure on him from Trump to do him the \u201cfavour\u201d he was asked for. Zelensky appeared at an awkward press conference with Trump in New York during the United Nations general assembly, looking particularly uncomfortable when the American suggested he take part in talks with Putin. AFP/Getty 6/19 Mike Pence The vice-president was not on the controversial July call to the Ukrainian president but did get a read-out later. However, Trump announced that Pence had had \u201cone or two\u201d phone conversations of a similar nature, dragging him into the crisis. Pence himself denies any knowledge of any wrongdoing and has insisted that there is no issue with Trump\u2019s actions. It has been speculated that Trump involved Pence as an insurance policy - if both are removed from power the presidency would go to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, something no Republican would allow. AP 7/19 Rick Perry Trump reportedly told a meeting of Republicans that he made the controversial call to the Ukrainian president at the urging of his own energy secretary, Rick Perry, and that he didn\u2019t even want to. The president apparently said that Perry wanted him to talk about liquefied natural gas - although there is no mention of it in the partial transcript of the phone call released by the White House. It is thought that Perry will step down from his role at the end of the year. Getty 8/19 Joe Biden The former vice-president is one of the frontrunners to win the Democratic nomination, which would make him Trump\u2019s opponent in the 2020 election. Trump says that Biden pressured Ukraine to sack a prosecutor who was investigating an energy company that Biden\u2019s son Hunter was on the board of, refusing to release US aid until this was done. However, pressure to fire the prosecutor came on a wide front from western countries. It is also believed that the investigation into the company, Burisma, had long been dormant. Reuters 9/19 Hunter Biden Joe Biden\u2019s son has been accused of corruption by the president because of his business dealings in Ukraine and China. However, Trump has yet to produce any evidence of corruption and Biden\u2019s lawyer insists he has done nothing wrong. AP 10/19 William Barr The attorney-general, who proved his loyalty to Trump with his handling of the Mueller report, was mentioned in the Ukraine call as someone president Volodymyr Zelensky should talk to about following up Trump\u2019s preoccupations with the Biden\u2019s and the Clinton emails. Nancy Pelosi has accused Barr of being part of a \u201ccover-up of a cover-up\u201d. AP 11/19 Mike Pompeo The secretary of state initially implied he knew little about the Ukraine phone call - but it later emerged that he was listening in at the time. He has since suggested that asking foreign leaders for favours is simply how international politics works. AFP via Getty 12/19 Nancy Pelosi The Democratic Speaker of the House had long resisted calls from within her own party to back a formal impeachment process against the president, apparently fearing a backlash from voters. On September 24, amid reports of the Ukraine call and the day before the White House released a partial transcript of it, she relented and announced an inquiry, saying: \u201cThe president must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d Getty 13/19 Adam Schiff Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, one of the three committees leading the inquiry. He was criticized by Republicans for giving what he called a \u201cparody\u201d of the Ukraine phone call during a hearing, with Trump and others saying he had been pretending that his damning characterisation was a verbatim reading of the phone call. He has also been criticised for claiming that his committee had had no contact with the whistleblower, only for it to emerge that the intelligence agent had contacted a staff member on the committee for guidance before filing the complaint. The Washington Post awarded Schiff a \u201cfour Pinocchios\u201d rating, its worst rating for a dishonest statement. Reuters 14/19 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman Florida-based businessmen and Republican donors Lev Parnas (pictured with Rudy Giuliani) and Igor Fruman were arrested on suspicion of campaign finance violations at Dulles International Airport near Washington DC on 9 October. Separately the Associated Press has reported that they were both involved in efforts to replace the management of Ukraine's gas company, Naftogaz, with new bosses who would steer lucrative contracts towards companies controlled by Trump allies. There is no suggestion of any criminal activity in these efforts.

Getty\n\nAnd Mr Trump dismissed the investigation into Mr Giuliani as a \u201ca one sided Witch Hunt\u201d carried out by the \u201cDeep State.\u201d\n\nThe president echoed language he had used to minimise the special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether he or his campaign worked with Russians who interfered in the 2016 election to try to help him win the presidency.\n\nMr Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York mayor, was retained last year to help defend the president in the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nBut his efforts to undermine the investigation\u2019s origins and its conclusions helped lead Mr Trump into an impeachment inquiry. The inquiry focuses on whether Mr Trump, with assistance from Mr Giuliani, abused the presidency to pressure Ukraine to pursue investigations for his political benefit, including into whether Ukrainians played a role in spurring the inquiry of the special counsel, Robert Mueller.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan are now investigating whether Mr Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine may have run afoul of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara), The New York Times reported Friday.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Another of Mr Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, Michael Cohen, met privately with the president in Florida in March 2018, a month before the FBI searched his home, hotel room and office. Mr Trump publicly embraced Mr Cohen, until it became clear he might speak against the president.\n\nA White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAsked over text message about the significance of the lunch, Mr Giuliani directed a reporter to Mr Trump\u2019s show of support on Twitter.\n\nHe said his relationship with Mr Trump was \u201cthe same as ever\u201d but declined to answer additional questions, explaining he was watching the New York Yankees\u2019 playoff game against the Houston Astros.\n\nThe two people familiar with the discussions between Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani said they believed it would be difficult to prove that Mr Giuliani violated Fara.\n\nThe law requires US citizens to disclose to the Justice Department any contacts with the government or media in the United States at the direction or request of foreign politicians or government officials, regardless of whether they paid for the representation.\n\nMr Giuliani has acknowledged that he and two of his associates, who were arrested on campaign finance charges Wednesday, worked with Ukrainian prosecutors to collect potentially damaging information about targets of Mr Trump and his allies, including a former US ambassador to Ukraine and former Vice President Joe Biden and his younger son, Hunter Biden.\n\nMr Giuliani shared that material this year with US government officials and a Trump-friendly columnist in an effort to undermine the ambassador and other Trump targets.\n\nBut Mr Giuliani said that he had undertaken that work on behalf of Mr Trump, not the Ukrainian prosecutors. He said he had in fact turned down an offer to represent one of the prosecutors because it would have posed a conflict with his work for the president.\n\nWhat concerns some of Mr Trump\u2019s advisers more than a possible Fara prosecution related to his Ukraine work is that Mr Giuliani, who has been representing the president pro bono, is facing a contentious and potentially costly divorce from his third wife, Judith Nathan, and that he may have taken on clients overseas who could be problematic for him with prosecutors.\n\nWhile Mr Trump has been reluctant to separate from Mr Giuliani, some of his advisers hope he will. They remain concerned about Mr Giuliani\u2019s public commentary about the president and the Ukraine issue.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "President Donald Trump had lunch Saturday with Rudy Giuliani amid revelations that prosecutors were investigating Mr Giuliani for possible lobbying violations, and speculation that his position as the president\u2019s personal lawyer was in jeopardy.", "authors": ["Kenneth P Vogel", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/08/trump-giuliani.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
