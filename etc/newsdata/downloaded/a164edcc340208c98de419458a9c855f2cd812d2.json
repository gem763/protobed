(\u201cBAM\u201d) into one corporate group to facilitate operational and administrative synergies. Pursuant to the Reorganization, the Company contributed the capital stock of Brookfield Residential US LLC (formerly, Brookfield Residential US Corporation) (\u201cBRUS LLC\u201d) to a subsidiary of BAM, Brookfield US Inc. (\u201cBUSI\u201d), and received a minority economic interest and 50% voting interest in BUSI. BUSI owns BAM\u2019s U.S. asset management business (fee-related business) and BAM\u2019s U.S. direct investments in managed listed entities and private funds.\n\nBUSI in turn contributed the capital stock of BRUS LLC to a newly established entity, Brookfield Residential US Holdings LLC (\u201cNew LLC\u201d), in which BUSI holds a 90% economic interest. The Company, through the managing member, Brookfield Residential GP LLC (\u201cNew GP\u201d), holds the remaining 10% economic interest in New LLC. In addition, a subsidiary of BUSI, BAM Homebuilder Finance Holdings LLC, has contributed to New LLC, Brookfield Holdings (Meadows) LLC and Brookfield Holdings (Hayden I) LLC (collectively \u201cLand Banking\u201d), which own and operate land assets in Arizona and the Pacific Northwest as part of the Homebuilder Finance platform, in exchange for a small economic interest in New LLC.\n\nFollowing the Reorganization, BRUS LLC will continue to be a consolidated subsidiary of BRPI, a co-issuer of BRPI\u2019s debt securities, and a co-borrower under its credit facility. New GP, New LLC and Land Banking will become guarantors of the debt securities and the credit facility.\n\nBrookfield Residential Properties Inc. is a leading land developer and homebuilder in North America. We entitle and develop land to create master-planned communities, build and sell lots to third-party builders, and conduct our own homebuilding operations.
