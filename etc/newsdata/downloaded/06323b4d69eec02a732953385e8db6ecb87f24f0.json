Here are some of their stories.", "language": "en", "text": "Randi Johnson sifts through a box of memorabilia at her Virginia home. Rather than relocate to Missouri, she\u2019s retiring early and moving to a more affordable home in Bethany Beach. There are advantages, Johnson said, but she\u2019s worried about heading into retirement alone. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nRandi Johnson raised the picture of her dead son\u2019s football team.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d she asked, tucking it back inside a growing pile of cardboard boxes in her torn-apart living room. \u201cAnd these are videos of his mission trip to Mexico. I don\u2019t have anything to play them on, but I can\u2019t throw them away.\u201d\n\nShe feels the same about her son\u2019s baseball caps. His old stuffed animals. Her dead wife\u2019s high school yearbooks. She is running out of time to decide.\n\nNext month, Johnson, a 28-year-veteran of the U.S. Agriculture Department who most recently led its program on climate change, will quit her job and move away from the home she can no longer afford. She packs one box a night, more on weekends, in preparation for an upheaval she neither wanted nor expected.\n\nThe USDA will partially relocate to Kansas City at the end of September, an abrupt decision announced in June that shocked the federal workforce and meant immediate disruption for hundreds.\n\nThe relocation to Missouri, which the USDA estimates will save $300 million over 15 years, affects about 550 people at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees a $1.7 billion portfolio of scientific grants.\n\n\n\nRachel Melnick had just had her second child and purchased her \u201cforever home\u201d when she learned her job was moving to Kansas City. (Evelyn Hockstein for The Washington Post)\n\n[Many USDA workers quit rather than move, creating a brain drain]\n\nIn the months since the announcement, two-thirds of USDA employees decided to leave their jobs rather than move, according to data released by the department in July. Academics have lamented the cost to science, saying the talent loss will devastate the agencies.\n\nBeyond the statistics, the move also is devastating families and forcing employees at all stages of life into wrenching decisions. Among those leaving the agency is Rachel Melnick, a married mother of two who just had a second child \u2014 and purchased a \u201cforever home\u201d in Virginia \u2014 when she learned her job was moving to Kansas City. And Jonathan McFadden, a researcher in his early 30s who was falling for his work, the District and a new girlfriend.\n\n[USDA research agencies will move to Kansas City despite opposition]\n\nJohnson did not want to quit her job. In addition to spearheading a climate change research program, she spent her days helping forest scientists find funding.\n\nA tree lover since childhood, when she saw how much her father enjoyed the forest, Johnson has a PhD in forest genetics and a master\u2019s degree in forest soils. She came to the federal government after several years performing field research in Brazil and New Zealand. Though she sometimes missed being among the trees, she found supporting others\u2019 research rewarding.\n\n\u201cI believed in their work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the tree breeding world, we all know each other. It\u2019s so small that it\u2019s always friends, not colleagues.\u201d\n\nBut Kansas City was never an option. It meant moving far from her daughter, who recently gave birth to Johnson\u2019s first grandchild. And she worried the Midwest might be less-than-welcoming to a 62-year-old transgender woman.\n\nJohnson physically transitioned from male to female about three years ago, the latest challenge in what has been the most difficult decade of her life \u2014 during which Johnson joined \u201cthree clubs I don\u2019t wish upon anyone: lost a spouse, lost a child and I\u2019m trans.\u201d\n\nHer wife, Jane, died of breast cancer 11 years ago. A few years later, Johnson\u2019s son Brett fatally overdosed on opioids, an addiction he picked up at his mother\u2019s bedside. Brett began sneaking Jane\u2019s opiates \u2014 from one of the pill bottles lined up on her dresser \u201clike a terra-cotta army,\u201d Johnson remembered \u2014 as a way to manage his overwhelming grief. He \u201calways was a mother\u2019s boy,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nTwo things saw Johnson through: her neighborhood and her church. When Jane died, residents of Falls Church swarmed to help, though the Johnsons had moved in just two months before. Neighbors Johnson barely knew stopped and offered her hugs on the street.\n\nFive years later, she was out to dinner at a restaurant in Dupont Circle when her daughter called to say Brett had overdosed. By the time Johnson made it home, \u201chalf the neighborhood was inside\u201d her house, waiting.\n\nWhen she transitioned in 2016, letting loose a lifelong secret, Johnson\u2019s closest friends \u2014 neighbors Teresa, Kristen and Yasmin \u2014 \u201cdid not miss a beat,\u201d she said. They took her clothes shopping. They offered daily fashion feedback as Johnson relearned how to dress for work.\n\nMost important, they kept sharing Friday nights. It happens pretty much the same way every weekend, Johnson said: One of the four texts the group chat asking, \u201cWho\u2019s got wine?\u201d Another remembers they have leftover food. Inevitably, the friends end up sitting on someone\u2019s deck, sipping and gossiping late into the evening.\n\nJohnson wants to stay.\n\nBut, after going zero-for-six on job applications in the D.C. area and consulting with a financial adviser, she\u2019s crating \u2014 or tossing \u2014 the pieces of her life and moving to Bethany Beach. Retiring early (she\u2019d hoped to quit with optimum benefits at 66) reduced her retirement income by about $18,000 per year. In Delaware, Johnson can afford the lifestyle, albeit on a tight budget.\n\nThere are advantages. She\u2019ll be within driving distance of her daughter. She\u2019s always wanted to live near the ocean.\n\nHer composure frays when she thinks about Fridays.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going into retirement alone,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just the thought of sitting in that house alone, at night . . .\u201d she trailed off.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do alone well.\u201d\n\n'Do I want to move with what's left?'\n\nRachel Melnick\u2019s husband always supported her career, so she wasn\u2019t surprised when he said he was willing to move to Kansas City.\n\nFor a while, she entertained the idea. After all, Melnick, 38, loved her work at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture: allocating money for research projects meant to help farmers adapt to climate change and become more efficient and more profitable.\n\nShe\u2019d gone to the USDA straight out of graduate school nine years ago. Melnick turned down \u201ca great job\u201d in the agricultural industry around the same time because she thought government work would be more stable, she said.\n\nAt the NIFA, she spent most of her time on the phone talking to researchers, farmers and small businesses with ideas for new farming techniques or products. Occasionally, she took road trips around the country to meet people face-to-face, one of her favorite parts of the job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great to see small business get an award for making something that\u2019s really going to help farmers or rural communities,\u201d Melnick said.\n\nHer love affair with farmers and plants began during her childhood in Lancaster County, Pa. Though Melnick\u2019s parents did not farm, she grew up driving through farmland \u2014 there was a dairy farm at one end of her neighborhood \u2014 and visiting farmers markets every Tuesday. She did not know it was possible to buy corn-on-the-cob from a supermarket until she was 12.\n\nMelnick\u2019s husband, an engineer who works in the District, is also from rural Pennsylvania, something the couple bonded over. It\u2019s why they bought a home 30 miles from Washington, out in a wooded area of Virginia; they wanted to raise their children in a bucolic setting. Somewhere their children could run outside and pick mushrooms or scare away deer.\n\nAbout a month after closing the deal on the house, Melnick ran outside with a yell to her brand-new backyard, where her husband was inspecting a fence.\n\nIt was August 2018, her first day back from the hospital. She\u2019d pulled out her phone to send a picture of her newborn son, Trevin, to USDA co-workers.\n\nInstead, she saw the email.\n\n\u201cIt was very frank: You will move out of this area,\u201d Melnick said. \u201cI was blindsided.\u201d\n\nMelnick and her colleagues had known for a while that the NIFA needed to leave its headquarters in Southwest Washington; the agency\u2019s building lease expires in December. But the expectation internally was that the agency would switch to another site in the District.\n\nThe email did not say where the NIFA would be moving, just that Melnick should be ready to relocate far from the D.C. area in about a year. The federal government did not announce Kansas City as the USDA\u2019s final destination until 11 months later, following a competitive bidding process \u2014 and a long period of uncertainty for Melnick.\n\nShe mulled the decision mostly during unpaid furlough in December and January, when the federal government underwent the longest shutdown in its history. As she pondered, she unpacked and hung pictures in her new home. Her father drove from Pennsylvania to help, playing for hours with his grandchildren. Kansas City, Melnick knew, is too far for her parents to drive.\n\n\u201cMorale at the agency was down, and people had already left, and [I was] thinking, \u2018Do I want to move with what\u2019s left?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd we want our kids to see their grandparents. So that was the choice we made.\u201d\n\nShe applied to roughly 50 jobs in the D.C. region, earning interviews from about six and winning one (\u201cit\u2019s a horrible market for a PhD right now,\u201d she said). At her new position, which she started a few weeks ago, Melnick seeks funding for agricultural research instead of granting it.\n\nShe knows she\u2019s been spared the agony many of her colleagues are facing. Before she left the NIFA, she tried her best to help \u2014 especially older co-workers, many of whom hadn\u2019t applied for a new job in over two decades, didn\u2019t know how to navigate Indeed or LinkedIn, and, like everyone at the agency, were operating under a tight deadline.\n\n\u201cPeople think we have something against Kansas City, and that\u2019s not true,\u201d Melnick said. \u201cIt was the way this move was done . . . everything\u2019s been so uncertain. Everything seems so seat-of-their-pants.\u201d\n\nThe August email is emblematic, she said. \u201cEven if they had come in person and told us . . . I would have had a lot more respect.\u201d\n\n'I'm trying to manage'\n\nJonathan McFadden always planned to enter academia. After four years in the District, he was starting to reconsider.\n\nMcFadden, 33, accepted a position at the Economic Research Service right after earning a PhD in economics from Iowa State University. He viewed the federal government as a placeholder, tiding him over until he found a university job. Still, he plunged into his research, asking questions such as, how can farmers best respond to climate change? How are farmers using genetically engineered crops?\n\nHe grew so engrossed that he started coming into the office on weekends. McFadden was \u201cdelighted\u201d with his colleagues: so smart, so dedicated, so approachable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous value in being able to stop by someone\u2019s cubicle and just say, \u2018Look at this graph, can you see this data point? What are your thoughts?\u2019 \u201d McFadden said. \u201cIt was a really great time in my life.\u201d\n\nIt was fulfilling personally, too. McFadden, who grew up in rural Oklahoma, had felt apprehensive about moving to Washington: \u201ca large city on the coast\u201d distant from the small-town life he knew. After a few false starts, he was swiftly enchanted.\n\nAn avid runner training for a marathon, McFadden joined jogging groups and found favorite routes: across the Mall, up to Mount Vernon, along the Capital Crescent Trail. The son of a music professor reveled in being able to attend \u201cworld-class concerts\u201d at the Kennedy Center.\n\nHe met his girlfriend a few months ago \u201cthe way every young person meets these days\u201d: online. It\u2019s still new, but it\u2019s going \u201cvery well,\u201d McFadden said.\n\nInspired by all of these \u201cpull factors,\u201d as he put it, McFadden sought several jobs in the D.C. area when he found out about the USDA relocation. After a feverish round of applications, his best option came in Oklahoma, near where he grew up. He received no offers in the District.\n\nMcFadden started as an assistant professor of economics at the University of Oklahoma last week. Though he feels the job is an \u201cexciting opportunity,\u201d the transition is hard to stomach.\n\nHe misses his work at the USDA \u2014 such as the long report on precision agriculture he\u2019ll never get to finish. He misses his girlfriend; the couple decided to try long-distance, given her job is based in Washington. He misses the city.\n\nMcFadden starts most mornings by listening to D.C.-based public radio station WAMU. He still gets emails inviting him to go on group jogs or attend events at D.C. bookstore Politics and Prose. He opens and reads every message.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough, but I\u2019m managing,\u201d McFadden said. He clarified: \u201cI\u2019m trying to manage.\u201d\n\n'Nobody sees you crying'\n\nJohnson spends every Sunday morning the same way.\n\nShe drives about 20 minutes to her church, Restoration United Methodist Church in Reston, to help a group of volunteers set up for the sermon and lay out breakfast for congregants. Johnson always prepares the coffee and lemonade pitchers. It\u2019s one of many lay leadership roles \u2014 including serving as an usher and leading a Bible study group \u2014 the church lets her hold, Johnson said, evidence of its unusually welcoming attitude toward LGBTQ individuals. She\u2019s searching for a similarly accepting church in Delaware.\n\nJohnson knows exactly how to cut the thin paper filters so they fit into the church\u2019s finicky coffee maker. She\u2019s labeled cups and pitchers with marker so she can measure out the right amounts of Lemonade powder and water without thinking.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, as she brewed coffee and poured lemonade, congregants approached to ask about the move. Some congratulated her on retirement. Johnson smiled, thanked them and cracked a few jokes.\n\nShe is trying to remain upbeat \u2014 and there\u2019s at least one upside to the drive to Delaware she\u2019ll undertake, alone, at the end of September.\n\n\u201cI learned when Jane died that driving is a great place to grieve,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNobody sees you crying when you\u2019re driving.\u201d", "description": "In the months since the announcement, two-thirds of USDA employees decided to leave their jobs rather than move, forcing families at all stages of life to make wrenching decisions.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
