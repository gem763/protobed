The company announced it had contracted to buy two logistics sites from Fife Group in Brisbane's Carole Park and Richlands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company did not disclose the agreed price, but said the two sites had a combined end development value of approximately $140 million on a yield of around 6 per cent and came with an 18 month rent guarantee on any unlet space.\n\nThe company also said it struck a further agreement with Fife to consolidate landholdings in western Sydney for a future $500 million, 71-hectare logistics estate. It gave no further details.\n\n\u201cThis strategic acquisition will build on the eight existing logistics assets we have in the western Sydney area, positioning us to leverage the investment boom generated by the Western Sydney Airport development,\u201d Mr Steinert said.\n\nStockland repeated its August predictions of a flat earnings and distributions for the current year.\n\n\u201cOur distribution payout will be at the bottom end of our 75-85 per cent target ratio,\" it said.", "description": "As recently as three months ago, Stockland was cutting forecasts, but it still warns of flat earnings and distribution this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4937%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_63%2C$y_541/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f1904cea79bfe8fb23951c9e133218f743fec9d4", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
