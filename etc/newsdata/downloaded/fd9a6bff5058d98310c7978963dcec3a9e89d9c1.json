I couldn't believe the total cost.\n\nI did try and do a bit of bulk shopping and meal planning so that I wasn't having to go to my chosen petrol station of Jet every day. I picked it purely because it was the closest one to me and used by many.\n\nBut I didn't realise initially how much my spending was adding up and the odd bit of impulse buying, as well as trying to eat as healthily as possible, racked up the bill.\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nThe Jet garage has a Londis inside with a selection of food, drink, alcohol, car supplies, pet food and even a 24/7 off-license stacked out with booze. But the prices of some of the items was shocking.\n\nTake a single tin of John West red salmon - it was actually priced at an eye-watering \u00a36.95. That's right. \u00a36.95. I very much doubt that they would be shifting much of their stock when they're charging that.\n\nMy favourite biscuits - chocolate hobnobs - were selling at \u00a32.99 and smoothies were priced up at \u00a33.55. Chocolate and sweets were also going for over the odds.\n\nThe sandwich meal deals, including a drink and chocolate bar or crisps, were \u00a34.95 and there wasn't much choice for the cost either.\n\nAs someone who loves a bargain, I was sad to see that none of the sandwiches were reduced in the evening if they were going out of date on the same day.\n\nThe garage wasn't kitted out for shoppers\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nAs the customers who normally frequent the garage just pop in for a couple of bits, there wasn't a basket in sight for me to put any of my goods in when I was trying to bulk buy.\n\nI had my arms overflowing with items, having to go over to the till and dump them on the side before going around again to select a couple more bits.\n\nOn one of the days I think one of the forecourt attendant's must have felt sorry for me, because she brought over a wheely basket trolley that she said the staff normally used for stacking the shelves. Bless her.\n\nThere was nothing healthy in there...apart from carrots\n\nTry as I might, I couldn't find any healthy food to eat throughout the week from the Jet petrol station. The only thing that would be remotely good for me was a random bag of carrots nestled next to the sandwiches.\n\nInstead, I tried to avoid as many snacks as possible and just stick to food that seemed full of the least junk, but it was a fool's errand. It was carb central with pasties, pies and pizza on offer and I was definitely a salad dodger for the week.\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nThe closest I came to something of nutrition was a frozen chicken roast that I heated up in the microwave on one of my late shifts. It tasted and looked like aeroplane food.\n\nI was forced to buy a smoothie to try and get in a couple of my five a day and I was most displeased at the price it set me back for the pleasure.\n\nWhat I ate throughout the week\n\nMonday\n\nBreakfast - Quaker Oat So Simple porridge pot made by adding boiling water\n\nLunch - John West Mediterranean salad\n\nDinner - Margarita pizza and a beer\n\nSnacks - Happy shopper bacon frazzles\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nThe week started off well with a breakfast I would normally eat anyway, so far so good.\n\nBut the tuna salad had a sell by date of June 2022 so was certainly not fresh and the only element of salad was a couple of olives and beans, which I didn't really think fit the brief.\n\nI couldn't complain about the margarita pizza or bacon frazzles though, as unhealthy as were. There was a tomato base to the pizza though and cheese has calcium in it, so that's okay, right? Nah, I think I'm just kidding myself.\n\nEven though it was the start of the week, I had been working all weekend without letting my hair down, so I thought I'd pick myself a beer out from the large selection of booze, which was actually much more varied than the food that was on offer.\n\nTuesday\n\nBreakfast - Quaker Oat So Simple porridge pot made by adding boiling water with a Monster energy can\n\nLunch - Chicken and bacon salad sandwich, munchies and sparkling water\n\nDinner - Beef lasagne\n\nSnacks - Orange twirl\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nStumbling in to the petrol station at 6.15am and rubbing the sleep out of my eyes, I bought breakfast and lunch ahead of my early shift at work and went for another porridge pot and an energy drink to try and wake myself up.\n\nFor lunch I went for the meal deal option, but there was hardly much of a sandwich selection to choose from and all of the boxes they were in looked a little worse for wear, beaten around the edges with withered lettuce peeking out of the bread.\n\nIt would have been better value to have bought a coke or a Fanta to save the most money, but as I was already having a fizzy drink for breakfast (very bad, I know), I went for sparkling water and chose munchies as my snack option.\n\nI was ravenous as soon as I got to work for some reason, so I switched things up and had my sandwich for breakfast and porridge for lunch, but both tasted fine.\n\nFor tea, I had a microwave lasagne and I couldn't complain about that either and the orange twirl was a delight. I recommend anyone to try one.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad food day.\n\nWednesday\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nBreakfast - Nomadic yoghurt and oat clusters\n\nLunch - Chicken tikki wrap\n\nDinner - Macaroni cheese\n\nSnacks - Eat natural almond and sultana bar, bacon rashers, hobnobs\n\nEven though my granola and yoghurt looked healthy, it was packed with sugar and the yoghurt was insipid, so all in all it was a poor start to the morning. Shame that I bought two really as I would still have to eat another later in the week.\n\nI actually really enjoyed my wrap as it had a nice amount of spice to it and contained actual salad. The macaroni cheese was just a standard microwave pasta dish, which as always would have tasted better if I made it from scratch.\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nThursday\n\nBreakfast - Quaker Oat So Simple porridge pot made by adding boiling water\n\nLunch - Ginsters Cornish pasty\n\nDinner - Ahh! Bisto roast chicken dinner\n\nSnacks - Dairy milk bar\n\nNot wanting to have the granola for a second day in a row, I went for porridge to start off my morning and had to closely guard it from my cat, who had taken a real interest in it after naughtily jumping up on the counter.\n\nFor lunch I went for a Ginsters Cornish pasty, which actually tasted better than I expected with a couple of dollops of ketchup that I pinched off a colleague, but heating it up in the microwave was my downfall as it made the pastry really soggy and split apart.\n\nSo even though the filling tasted alright, the outer crust didn't.\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nI was on the solo late shift at work and it was a good job I was. My roast chicken dinner took more than 12 minutes to cook! So at least I didn't have to keep any co-workers waiting for the microwave.\n\nWhen I got it out of the packaging, it looked like airline food and it also tasted like it upon consumption. It certainly wasn't a carvery boost, but I think it was actually my favourite meal of the week because it had something in it that tasted like real meat and a bit of veg, although the stuffing ball nearly broke my teeth when I bit in to it.\n\nI also really missed the Yorkshire pudding.\n\nFriday\n\nBreakfast - Nomadic yoghurt and oat clusters\n\nLunch - Rustlers bacon and beef burger with cheese and relish\n\nDinner - Chicken tikka curry\n\nSnacks - Salt and vinegar crisps\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nYet again I did not enjoy the granola, but it was at least edible.\n\nI really wasn't looking forward to the Rustlers burger but it is a classic staple of petrol station food so I had to try it didn't I?\n\nI foolishly put the full burger in the microwave including the bread, which crated a soggy bread bun that then turned rather hard. I added a cheese slice, along with relish and then had to wait a long time for the bread to cool down before I could even pick it up.\n\nI also thought I'd bought a multipack of crisps, but when I opened them to take them to work I found that it was in fact a big bag, so I looked rather greedy bringing them in. I didn't eat them all though, promise.\n\nFeeling rather queasy after my burger, I wasn't really looking forward to more stodge in the form of my curry for the evening either.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll of my meals could either just be eaten as they were, or needed hot water adding or heating up in the microwave, or the oven. I did zero cooking all week and had no washing up as everything was packaged up - hooray!\n\nBut as there was so much food packaging, this surely isn't good for the environment.\n\nBreakfast was pretty easy as what I chose wasn't too dissimilar to what I would normally have, but I wish that I stuck to the porridge alone as the granola and yoghurt was not for me.\n\n(Image: HullLive)\n\nBut other than the sandwich meal deal I had, the rest of the lunches weren't options that I would normally pick, especially the microwaveable burger. Ugh.\n\nEven though I may have a pizza now and again, I normally always make my evening meal and never make ready meals, so that wasn't something that I was used to.\n\nEven though I'm not the biggest fan of cooking, I did actually miss making a hot meal cooked from scratch with natural ingredients and yearned for a supermarket shop with more options and cheaper prices.\n\nI felt a bit bloated and yucky by the end of the week as I didn't eat as nearly many vegetables as I normally would and no fruit as there was no access to any, unless my smoothie counted.\n\nCoeliacs or vegans would struggle eating out of this petrol station for a week due to lack of choice - you won't find a loaf of gluten-free bread or an avocado, that's for sure.\n\nI did try to meal plan but as there were no real raw ingredients to make things from, I was forced to grab pre-made sarnies, crisps and chocolate bars, and ready meals as they were quick and easy with drinks and squash adding to the overall bill for the week.\n\nThere was milk, bread, bacon and butter though and packaged chicken and ham so staples of some form in this sense.\n\nOverall, it was an interesting experiment but I'll be sticking to Lidl and Aldi for the sake of my bank balance, waist line and health in general.", "description": "Hull journalist Anna Riley relied on ready meals and Rustlers burgers during a pricey five-day experiment that left her feeling \"bloated and yucky\", but there was one bright side - no real cooking or washing up", "authors": ["Anna Riley", "Image", "Hulllive"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20656741.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_191019Slug_110206.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
