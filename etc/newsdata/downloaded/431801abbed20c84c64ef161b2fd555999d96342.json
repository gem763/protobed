(AP) - There were many plays that caused the Detroit Lions to blow an 18-point late lead in Sunday\u2019s opener in Arizona.\n\nThe instance getting the most attention, while being added to the long list of miserable Lions memories for the fan base, is a late timeout in the 27-27 tie against the Cardinals.\n\nQuarterback Matthew Stafford was caught by television cameras appearing to twice say \u201ctrust me\u201d after the sideline called a timeout as the play clock was winding down before a third-and-5 play in the fourth quarter. Though the play was blown dead, Stafford found J.J McKissic on a screen pass that might\u2019ve put the game further out of reach for Kyler Murray and the Cardinals.\n\nNew offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell made the timeout signal, but head coach Matt Patricia said he calls the timeouts. Patricia insisted Monday there\u2019s no trust issue with the 11th-year quarterback.\n\n\u201cTo sum it up, like 1,000 percent,\u201d Patricia said Monday when asked about his trust level with Stafford. \u201cEveryone knows how much I think of, how highly I think of him and trust him. There\u2019s no issue.\u201d\n\nDefensive lineman Damon Harrison tweeted after the game that he \u201cgot dominated\u201d and took responsibility for the loss, in which he had one tackle.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t my usual productive self,\u201d Harrison said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s what I meant by dominated. They didn\u2019t do anything to take me out of my game. But anytime I don\u2019t have the production I\u2019m used to having, I feel like I let the team down.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nStafford had it rolling throughout most of the game, completing 20 of his first 29 passes for 301 yards and three touchdowns. However, after going up 24-6 early in the fourth quarter, the Lions ran the ball eight times and passed three times on two straight empty possessions.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nSpecial teams were sloppy, as Sam Martin had a punt blocked, getting only 11 yards on a kick that set up Arizona\u2019s tying drive. Returner Jamal Agnew also fumbled away a punt, giving Arizona the ball at Detroit\u2019s 8-yard line.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nRookie tight end T.J. Hockenson had six catches for 131 yards and a touchdown in his debut. The eighth overall draft pick from Iowa gained at least 10 yards on each of his first five catches.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nLeft tackle Taylor Decker had an opener to forget, with four penalties and two sacks allowed. The Lions had questions on the interior of the offensive line, with center Frank Ragnow dealing with a position change and ankle injury in the preseason, and Joe Dahl and Graham Glasgow as new starters at guard. But Decker\u2019s afternoon causes consternation from a position where the Lions appeared set.\n\nINJURED\n\nCornerback Rashaan Melvin was a limited participant in practice last week with a knee injury but played well in his Detroit debut, making eight tackles. The Lions were without linebacker Jarrad Davis (ankle) and defensive lineman Da\u2019Shawn Hand (elbow), whose possible returns could help the defensive front against the Chargers on Sunday.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n6 - The last six teams to tie a game in the NFL did not make the playoffs that season. Seattle tied Arizona on Oct. 23, 2016, and made the postseason. But since then, Washington, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Green Bay and Minnesota have tied games and missed the postseason that year.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nAfter tying a rookie head coach and quarterback in Kliff Kingsbury and Murray, the Lions now have a tough stretch of opposing quarterbacks in Philip Rivers of the Los Angeles Chargers, Carson Wentz of Philadelphia and Patrick Mahomes of Kansas City before a bye week. Then, divisional matchups against Green Bay and Minnesota await.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There were many plays that caused the Detroit Lions to blow an 18-point late lead in Sunday's opener in Arizona.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Schoch"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
