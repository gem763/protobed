During his court appearance he appeared confused and complained, once again, about the conditions of his captivity.\n\nAssange is being held in British prison pending his February 2020 hearing to decide whether he will be extradited to the US to stand trial for possession and dissemination of classified information.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018I can\u2019t think properly\u2019: Assange disoriented as court rejects delay for extradition proceedings\n\nLike this story?
