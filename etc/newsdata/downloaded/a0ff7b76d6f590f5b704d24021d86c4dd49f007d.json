Some were incensed by the idea that Ocasio-Cortez essentially had to choose between looking polished, or as one user called it, \"raggedy,\" as that would have been the \"lead story\" instead.\n\nOthers questioned whether the same story would be written about a man, mocking detractors for insinuating Ocasio-Cortez shouldn't be spending any money at all on goods or services.\n\nLeaving all other issues aside, $80 for a woman's haircut is a bargain in NYC. What are people expecting #AOC to do? Go to a salon's free hair model night? https://t.co/sFZEY3rBTR \u2014 (((Helaine Olen))) (@helaineolen) October 10, 2019\n\nCan\u2019t believe AOC didn\u2019t dye and cut her own hair instead of paying normal prices to get it done at a salon. pic.twitter.com/upKKfcI7FI \u2014 pokey pup (@Whatapityonyou) October 10, 2019\n\nso...a normal haircut, then?\n\n\n\nsocialism doesn't mean \"let's all squat in the dirt eating worms\" it means \"no one gets to be a god-king floating atop a billion-dollar raft they can never spend in a thousand lifetimes while people die without medicare or food\" pic.twitter.com/7ckCTWEfzb\n\n\n\n\u2014 Anthony Oliveira (@meakoopa) October 10, 2019\n\nhell i just heard what you paid, thats a great deal for your length of hair and likely the treatment you got, so yeah girl, look good while doing it. their just Hating cause your shining and there not! keep it up and get em #TheSquad \u2014 Kurai Bastet (@KuraiBastet) October 10, 2019\n\ni\u2019m just saying if you\u2019re gonna critique aoc\u2019s socialism, it should be a smarter argument than \u201cshe pays fairly for the services she receives\u201d\n\n\n\nalso! tip your hair stylists\n\n\n\n\u2014 Angela Vang (@angvaj) October 10, 2019\n\nI would empty my damn bank account for AOC\u2019s hair \u2014 Lynn Coady (@Lynn_Coady) October 10, 2019\n\nI grew up in a salon. My father was a hair stylist. Can confirm @AOC paid a low price for a woman\u2019s haircut and left a kind tip. I pay $80 (tip included) for a simple cut and wash.
