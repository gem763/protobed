A full-scale, US-assisted offensive to reclaim the city is expected soon.\n\nTurkey, a vital NATO power and anti-ISIS ally, is not taking this news lightly. Today, in a press conference alongside President Trump, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u01e7an\u2019s visit said arming the YPG must \u201cnever be accepted.\u201d\n\nLast week Turkey threatened to take military action against the YPG in closed-door meetings with US national security officials, per the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s message to the Trump administration was that Turkey reserves the right to take military action,\u201d a senior Turkish official told the Washington Post.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s top spokesperson, Dana White, had announced Tuesday that Trump authorized the Department of Defense \u201cto equip Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces as necessary to ensure a clear victory over ISIS in Raqqa.\u201d\n\nThis was a move Gen. Joseph Votel \u2014 whose perch at the helm of the military\u2019s Central Command means he oversees the US wars in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Yemen \u2014 signaled all the way back in February. At the time, Votel said the US \u201cwould be transparent\u201d with Turkey about its aid to the Kurds.\n\nThere has been no official word about what kinds of weaponry the YPG will get, but 120mm mortars, machine guns, ammunition, and light armored vehicles are possibilities, reports the Guardian. Artillery and surface-to-air missiles have been ruled out, at least for now.\n\nThe plan is to give the YPG the materials it needs to help take Raqqa and then limit the amount that gets to them once the fighting has stopped. Meanwhile, Trump has nearly doubled the number of US troops in northern Syria, now totaling around 900, to provide artillery support and training.\n\nAnd while the United States already provided gear to the YPG like night vision goggles and rifles, this is the first time Washington is publicly admitting it is providing weapons to help win a part of the war.\n\nFred Hof, President Obama\u2019s special adviser for transition in Syria who is now at the Atlantic Council, told me in an interview he thinks the Pentagon \u201cgrew weary of denying reports it was already arming the YPG. The new announcement at least regularizes matters.\u201d\n\nThere was a reason the Pentagon had spent so many months playing down its ties to the YPG: Turkey, a NATO member that fears the militia is helping the PKK claim an independent Kurdistan, which would take away Turkish territory.\n\nThe US silence about something everyone knew was happening didn\u2019t really succeed in placating Turkey \u2014 and Trump\u2019s decision to go public will just make the frosty ties between Ankara and Washington even frostier.\n\n\"Every weapon that they deliver is a threat to Turkey,\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters after the US decision was announced.\n\nWashington loves the Kurds. Turkey doesn\u2019t.\n\nHere\u2019s why Erdogan and Cavusoglu are so angry.\n\nAnkara considers the YPG to be part and parcel of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, a Turkish Kurdish group that had waged a bloody fight for autonomy from Turkey since the 1980s. Turkey and the United States label the PKK as a terrorist group.\n\nIn 2015, a ceasefire between the PKK and Turkey ended after Erdo\u01e7an vowed to \u201cliquidate\u201d the group. Since July 20, 2015, the ceasefire\u2019s end has led to at least 2,748 deaths, according to the International Crisis Group.\n\nAnd in April, Turkey bombed YPG militia members in Iraq and Syria. So clearly Turkey is not a big fan of the Kurds.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s important to keep in mind: Trump\u2019s announcement effectively admitted that America provides weaponry to the YPG, a militia Turkey thinks is an enemy of the state.\n\nThat\u2019s going to make Erdo\u01e7an\u2019s May 16 visit to Washington super awkward, assuming that Erdo\u01e7an doesn\u2019t call it off first (which seems unlikely; the relationship, even if strained, is hugely important to both governments).\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, White is \u201ckeenly aware\u201d of the weird spot Trump\u2019s YPG policy puts Turkey in. She told CNN yesterday that the arming of the YPG will be \u201climited, mission-specific, and metered out incrementally as objectives are reached,\u201d a message clearly meant to assuage Turkish fears.\n\nThe YPG couldn\u2019t be happier, though. A YPG spokesperson also told CNN that it was a \u201chistorical decision\u201d that will allow the group to continue fighting terrorism.\n\nRegardless, the Trump administration\u2019s decision to arm the YPG officially makes the war against ISIS more complex, and could potentially hurt America\u2019s role in it.\n\n\u201cThis is a mistake,\u201d James Jeffrey, a former US ambassador to Turkey, bluntly told USA Today.\n\nHis main concern is that Turkey may deny America the use of its Incirlik Air Base, located in Turkey\u2019s south near Syria. Turkey agreed in July 2015 to let US warplanes and drones fly out of the facility for bombing and surveillance missions against ISIS.\n\nThat matters because having a base near where the fighting takes place makes it easier to get involved when necessary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a successful campaign against ISIS without our bases in Turkey,\u201d Jeffrey continued.\n\nEven by arming the YPG, the battle to take Raqqa will still be one hell of a fight, according to Hof.\n\n\u201cUsing militiamen to do the ground combat in a complex urban environment may, absent a healthy ration of good luck, produces less than optimal results, especially for civilians caught in the crossfire,\u201d he told me.\n\nISIS lost about a quarter of its territory last year, and Secretary of Defense James Mattis wants to make sure that trend continues. He said that America plans to \u201cfurther accelerate\u201d the fight against ISIS.\n\nThe decision to arm the YPG appears to be part of that acceleration. The only question is whether it will actually help \u2014 or whether it could, paradoxically, set things back.", "description": "And Turkey, a powerful NATO member, threatened to bomb a key US ally in response.", "authors": ["Alex Ward", "Anya Van Wagtendonk", "Allegra Frank", "Jane Coaston", "P.R.
