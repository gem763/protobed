That happened in Brazil at the weekend. Before Fluminense hosted Bahia in the Maracan\u00e3, the two clubs\u2019 managers embraced on the touchline wearing matching anti-racism T-shirts.\n\nBoth men are black. It should not be remarkable to see two black managers leading teams in the top flight of Brazilian football. Yet, in a country where more than half of the population identifies as black or mixed race, only two S\u00e9rie A managers do.\n\nTheir T-shirts were emblazoned with the logo of the Observat\u00f3rio da Discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o Racial no Futebol, an organisation that campaigns tirelessly to rid the game of racism. \u201cI know what I represent, as Fluminense manager, for people of our colour,\u201d said Marc\u00e3o in his pre-match press conference.\n\nSome people in Brazil still claim that race has no bearing on a person\u2019s life chances, but that could not be further from the truth. Speaking in his post-match press conference, Bahia boss Roger Machado dismantled that myth with an emphatic mixture of clarity, concision and calm. \u201cTwo black managers facing each other in the technical area shouldn\u2019t be worthy of attention,\u201d he began. \u201cWhile more than 50% of the population is black and the proportion represented [in the dugout] is not equal, we must reflect and question ourselves.\n\nDani Alves: 'If you win without effort, you triumph with no glory at all' Read more\n\n\u201cIf there is no prejudice in Brazil, why do black people receive a poorer education? Why is 70% of the prison population black? Why are young black people more likely to be killed in Brazil? Why do lower salaries go to black men and women? Why, among white and black women, are black women more likely to be killed? How many black women are there in sports journalism? If there\u2019s no prejudice in Brazil, what are the responses to these questions?\u201d\n\nPeople say that me being here is the proof racism doesn\u2019t exist. No. The proof of racism is that only I am here. Bahia manager Roger Machado\n\n\u201cWe live with structural, institutionalised prejudice. Insults are only the symptom. The responsibility belongs to all of us, but the blame for this backwardness after 388 years of slavery belongs to the state. We have a system of beliefs and rules that were established by power. The power of the state, the media, the church. When these powers do not want to accept that racism exists and that there needs to be a correction of course, a lot of the time we\u2019ll hear people saying that it is victimhood or reverse racism. The truth is that 10 million people were enslaved. More than 25 generations. This started in colonial Brazil, continued in imperial Brazil and has only been masked in the Brazilian Republic. We need to leave the stage of denial.\n\n\u201cTo deny and to silence is to confirm racism. The greatest prejudice I feel is not racial insults. I feel prejudice when I go to a restaurant and I am the only black person. At the university I went to, I was the only black person. People say that me being here is the proof that racism doesn\u2019t exist. No. The proof of racism is that only I am here.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lucas Santos while training with the Brazil squad earlier this year.

Last Thursday, 17-year-old Cavalcante was shot six times by police in a barbershop in the community of Para-Pedro, 15km from the Maracan\u00e3. Above a retweeted video of a military police officer pointing an automatic weapon at innocent people, kicking bystanders and firing live ammunition into the air, Lucas wrote: \u201cIt was in the favela where I was born, grew up and learned a lot in life. That barbers is where I had my hair cut. I know the victims and everybody knows their characters. For Witzel, however, being black and poor is enough for his genocidal spirit to manifest itself.\u201d\n\nThe Witzel in question is Rio governor Wilson Witzel, who came to power by riding the wave of right-wing hysteria that took Jair Bolsonaro to the president\u2019s office. While in power, Witzel has instigated a bloody campaign of police raids in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s poorest communities. In theory, the aim is to clamp down on drug gangs, but the effects have been devastating.\n\nFrom January to June this year, police in the state of Rio killed 885 people, the largest number in any six-month period since this data was first collected in 1998. Last month, the case of eight-year-old \u00c1gatha F\u00e9lix, who was killed by a police officer on her way home from school, made international headlines. The conservative magazine Veja reported that, after the shooting, up to 20 military police officers went to the hospital where she had died and demanded that staff hand over the bullet.\n\nMany current and former footballers \u2013 including Felipe Melo, Ronaldinho, Kak\u00e1, Lucas Moura and Cafu \u2013 openly back Bolsonaro, but events this weekend have shown that Brazilian football is not populated exclusively by reactionaries. \u201cThe sea of poor people\u2019s blood is immense,\u201d continued 20-year-old Lucas in his next tweet. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re a strong guy [Witzel], being the main instigator of this and being able to sleep with a calm head\u2026 For real, I wouldn\u2019t be able to.\u201d Lucas finished off with the hashtag #ACulpa\u00c9DoWitzel (#It\u2019sWitzel\u2019sFault).\n\nBrazilians blame Rio governor's shoot-to-kill policy for death of girl Read more\n\nThis is not the first social issue on which Brazilian football has taken a stance this year. In August, referee Anderson Daronco stopped a game between Vasco da Gama and S\u00e3o Paulo because Vasco fans were singing that S\u00e3o Paulo were \u201ca team of faggots\u201d. Daronco signalled that the match would not recommence until all homophobic abuse ceased, an announcement was made in the stadium and Vasco manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo told fans that they should stop chanting. They did so almost immediately and the game went on. Racist, homophobic and misogynistic insults are still defended by many in Brazil as acceptable \u201czueira\u201d, or \u201cbanter\u201d, inside the stadium, but this attitude is slowly changing.\n\nWith so much support for men such as Witzel and Bolsonaro from within the game, these often appear dark times for Brazilian football\u2019s dotted tradition as a means of social resistance. But, like the dictatorship did in the 1970s and 1980s, the threat of an oppressive, racist, misogynistic, homophobic regime may be creating the conditions for a counter-attack, empowering some elements of what should be a diverse, open sport to rediscover a progressive political conscience.\n\nSometimes campaigns like the one seen on the T-shirts Roger and Marc\u00e3o wore on Sunday appear devoid of life, just another empty gesture from the authorities in a fight to which they have never really been committed. This time, that was far from the case.\n\n\u2022 This is an article from Yellow & Green Football\n\n\u2022 Follow them on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter\n\n\u2022 And follow Joshua Law on Twitter", "description": "Marc\u00e3o and Roger, the only black managers in S\u00e9rie A, stood together to oppose the prejudice they see in Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil", "authors": ["Joshua Law"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fffa96d18a127f33d30f99366b8f0403fb091533/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e698892b701208f3257391ecd331bd6", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
