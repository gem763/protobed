The Justice Department is now opening a criminal investigation into the Russia investigation known as Crossfire Hurricane. The change in status could lead to subpoenas for witnesses and potentially criminal charges:\n\nJustice Department officials have shifted an administrative review of the Russia investigation closely overseen by Attorney General William P. Barr to a criminal inquiry, according to two people familiar with the matter. The move gives the prosecutor running it, John H. Durham, the power to subpoena for witness testimony and documents, to impanel a grand jury and to file criminal charges\u2026 Mr. Barr\u2019s reliance on Mr. Durham, a widely respected and veteran prosecutor who has investigated C.I.A. torture and broken up Mafia rings, could help insulate the attorney general from accusations that he is doing the president\u2019s bidding and putting politics above justice. It was not clear what potential crime Mr. Durham is investigating, nor when the criminal investigation was prompted. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe Times story opens by noting that this development plays into President Trump\u2019s hands by raising doubts about an investigation Trump has called a hoax. That\u2019s true but it seems less important than what prompted Durham and Barr to make this move. The authors don\u2019t claim to know the answer to that but they speculate that it might have something to do with the nearly completed Inspector General\u2019s report:\n\nAs Mr. Durham\u2019s investigation moves forward, the Justice Department inspector general is wrapping up his own inquiry into aspects of the F.B.I.\u2019s conduct in the early days of the Russia investigation. Among other things, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is scrutinizing the application for a warrant to wiretap Mr. Page. Mr. Barr has not said whether Mr. Durham\u2019s investigation grew out of the inspector general\u2019s findings or something that prosecutors unearthed while doing interviews or reviewing documents. But the inspector general\u2019s findings, which are expected to be made public in coming weeks, could contribute to the public\u2019s understanding of why Mr. Durham might want to investigate national security officials\u2019 activities in 2016.\n\nThe story also rehashes some previous reporting that Durham is expected to interview various people at the CIA about their role in kickstarting Crossfire Hurricane. Earlier this week, Ed wrote about an NBC story which specifically said Durham\u2019s investigation had expanded to look at James Clapper and John Brennan.\n\nThe prosecutor conducting the review, Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, has expressed his intent to interview a number of current and former intelligence officials involved in examining Russia\u2019s effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper, Brennan told NBC News\u2026 The prosecutor conducting the review, Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, has expressed his intent to interview a number of current and former intelligence officials involved in examining Russia\u2019s effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper, Brennan told NBC News.\n\nDurham\u2019s interest apparently goes beyond the launch of Crossfire Hurricane to events that happened in early 2017. It\u2019s not clear yet what that means but I wonder if he wants to ask Clapper and Brennan about the decision to brief Trump about the Steele dossier. The stated reason for the briefing was that the intel community knew the news media was on the verge of publishing some of the claims in the dossier. And yet, within days of the briefing, CNN had learned of it and made the briefing the news hook to publish a story about the dossier\u2019s contents. As Mollie Hemingway asked two years ago \u201cwas the entire purpose of the meeting to produce the leak that the meeting happened?\u201d\n\nThat seems far-fetched to a lot of people but I\u2019m not sure why. Given John Brennan\u2019s over-the-top hostility toward Trump, nothing would surprise me. Remember this is the guy who predicted all sorts of final indictments were coming that never came. He later apologized for that but there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s very partisan and, I think it\u2019s fair to conclude, always has been.", "description": "\"It was not clear what potential crime Mr. Durham is investigating...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/brennan-msnbc.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
