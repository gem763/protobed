Traders are ignoring the negative headlines over U.S.-China trade relations and weaker-than-expected economic data out of Australia. Instead, we\u2019re looking at some aggressive short-covering and position-squaring ahead of the start of trade talks between the two economic powerhouses on October 10.\n\nAt 09:02 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .6741, up 0.0014 or +0.20% and the NZD/USD is at .6317, up 0.0019 or +0.30%.\n\nNeedless to say, it\u2019s been a tough week with the narrative shifting several times. Some days, uncertainty is making the U.S. Dollar a more attractive asset, other days the greenback has weakened. The moves are likely being fueled by light volume as many of the major players remain on the sidelines ahead of the trade talks. With the outcome of the trade talks a 50/50 deal or worse, big money doesn\u2019t seem to want to pick a side in the market.\n\nTrade Tensions Still Major Concern\n\nDespite the early strength in the Aussie and Kiwi, investors are still uncertain over the outcome of the trade talks. The headlines are causing the uncertainty with the U.S. expanding its black list of companies in China, and the world\u2019s largest economy threatening retaliation. There is even a report from China that its trade delegation may cut short trade talks on Friday. While not triggering a break in the Aussie and Kiwi, the news may be keeping a lid on prices.\n\nAussie Traders Shrug Off Bearish Consumer Confidence\n\nAustralian consumer confidence tumbled to a four-year low even after three rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and a healthy tax refund.\n\nThe Westpac Consumer Sentiment Index fell more than 5 percent in October to 92.8 points, its lowest reading since July 2015. The survey was taken the first week of October when the RBA cut rates a third time since June.\n\nWestpac chief economist Bill Evans said the result would concern RBA officials.\n\n\u201cTypically, an interest rate cut boosts confidence particularly around consumers\u2019 expectations for and assessments of their own finances,\u201d Mr. Evans said.\n\n\u201cIssues that may also be unnerving consumers include the debate around the lack of response of fiscal policy to the deteriorating outlook; the banks\u2019 partial pass through to the standard variable mortgage rate of the recent official rate cut; and the realization amongst Australians that wages growth is likely to remain stuck at a modest 2 percent a year or less for the foreseeable future,\u201d Mr. Evans said.\n\nDaily Forecast\n\nTraders will be focused on the Fed minutes from its mid-September policy meeting. Traders are hoping the minutes offer clues as to whether further policy easing is yet to come.\n\nOn Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that the central bank is \u201cnot on a preset course\u201d when it comes to future monetary policy. He also added that the Next FOMC meeting is still several weeks away, \u201cand we will be carefully monitoring incoming information.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Traders will be focused on the Fed minutes from its mid-September policy meeting.
