That is not up for discussion or negotiation. That is our red line in the sand,\u201d Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger told Sky News.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMrs. Sacoolas has to commit to returning to the United Kingdom to submit herself to the English authorities, to Northamptonshire Police, and to cooperate with their inquiries,\u201d he later told the BBC.\n\nAD\n\nDunn\u2019s devastated parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn flew to the United States over the weekend in a bid to drum up more U.S. coverage of the case and to put more pressure on President Trump to intervene and help them obtain justice for their son.\n\nIn remarks last week, Trump called the incident a \u201cterrible accident\u201d and said driving on the wrong side of the road \u201chappens.\u201d At the news conference, Trump was photographed holding \u201csecret\u201d briefing notes that stated Sacoolas would not return to Britain.\n\nAD\n\nHarry\u2019s parents had previously expressed hope that Trump would consider waiving diplomatic immunity so that Sacoolas can be held accountable in the British legal system. The U.S. Embassy noted in a statement that \u201cimmunity is rarely waived.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend it emerged that Sacoolas no longer has diplomatic immunity because she is not on British soil anymore. According to British media reports, a letter to the Dunn family from Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab read: \u201cThe U.K. government\u2019s position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs. Sacoolas\u2019 case, because she has returned home.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe U.S. have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent,\u201d the letter continues.\n\nAD\n\nSacoolas\u2019s lawyer says the suspect is \u201cdevastated by the tragic accident\u201d which took place near the Royal Air Force Croughton station, which is operated by the U.S. Air Force, and would like to meet with Harry\u2019s parents to offer an apology.\n\nReacting to the prospect of an apology from Sacoolas almost seven weeks after the fatal collision, Harry\u2019s mother told Sky News: \u201cSorry just doesn\u2019t cut it. It\u2019s not really quite enough. I\u2019m still very open to meeting her,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t promise what I would or wouldn\u2019t say, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t be aggressive.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week that he hoped Sacoolas would return to Britain and \u201cengage properly with the processes of law.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s death has sparked widespread outrage in Britain. In recent weeks there has been fierce debate over the concept of diplomatic immunity, who it should apply to and what it should cover.\n\nAD", "description": "Anne Sacoolas left the country under diplomatic immunity and did not have to face the British justice system.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M5cLGJ1yTJBZ9ewNeNsKlfgj1SQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBE6N5XLN4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
