Camping World, a publically traded company, owns Gander, with Lemonis owning 36 million shares.\n\nBack in May, officials from the city about 40 miles north of Charlotte sued the company over the size of the flag. The flag measures 40 feet by 80 feet (12 meters by 24 meters) and hangs on a 130-foot-high (40-meter-high) flagpole next to Interstate 77. The code limits flags to 25 feet by 40 feet (7.6 meters by 12 meters).\n\nBut recently, Statesville city leaders voted to rezone the area Gander RV sits on, making the flag compliant with the ordinance, according to Fox 46.\n\nThe settlement, which came down Monday, comes with a price according to the local Fox affiliate. Gander RV must pay over $14,000 in fines for originally breaking the ordinance, with an additional $2,000 in legal costs. The decision also means Lemonis would no longer be fined $50 a day for the violation.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % CWH CAMPING WORLD HOLDINGS INC 8.03 -0.56 -6.52%\n\nSince the lawsuit erupted, Lemonis has repeatedly lamented the city\u2019s size ban on a huge America flag flying at his store is unconstitutional, even citing that he would rather go to jail than take the flag down.\n\nLemonis responded to the controversy, telling FOX Business during an interview on \"Bulls & Bears\u201d that he is in the battle for the long haul.\n\n\u201cWe have flown this flag for a long time,\u201d Lemonis said. \u201cAs I told the city\u2026it\u2019s not coming down under any circumstance.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Lemonis had said in a filing that the flag \u201crepresents the fundamental values \u2014 freedom, courage and equality before the law \u2014 that unite all Americans and transcend party politics. ... In keeping with this tradition, The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized that the act of flying the flag is a form a political expression protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHowever, the filing also pointed to a North Carolina state law that says reasonable restrictions on the size of official governmental flags are allowed if necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare. Statesville\u2019s restriction on flag size \u201cserves no legitimate safety purpose,\u201d the filing said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBack in May, after declaring that he would rather go to jail before taking the flag down, the mayor issued a statement saying he had asked the city\u2019s planning department to change the dimensions allowed for flags displayed in a highway business zone.\n\nThe move wasn't good enough for Lemonis who previously declared, \u201cWhat we\u2019re asking for and what we\u2019re not going to back down on is ... for the city to modify the ordinance to eliminate the size of flag regulation and the size of pole regulation unless it interferes with the FAA, it interferes with people\u2019s health, wellness or safety, or it blocks the visibility of a consumer to another person\u2019s business.\"\n\nDuring the interview with FOX Business, Lemonis added that the flag, which is the same size flag and pole in over 180 cities across at the RV retailer the country, is in compliance with federal aviation rules.\n\n\u201cWe know that before the flag pole goes up and before the flag goes up we want to ensure that people are safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not messing with the FAA in terms of air traffic rules.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press and FOX Business' Henry Fernandez contributed to this report.", "description": "The stars and stripes controversy pitting star of CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Profit\u201d against a North Carolina city over the size of an American Flag sitting at the star\u2019s recreational vehicle store has been settled.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/giant-flag-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
