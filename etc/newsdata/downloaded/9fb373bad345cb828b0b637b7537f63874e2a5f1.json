In recent years, I\u2019ve been disappointed by how little I\u2019ve seen for people 50+; nearly all the consumer presentations were aimed at millennials, as though they\u2019re the only ones using technology to help manage their money.\n\nFinovate Fall 2019 this year, however, was \u2014 I\u2019m happy to say \u2014 different.\n\nI was especially intrigued by one new service that aims to help with retirement planning and retirement income: Kindur\u2019s Retirement Paycheck. Two other interesting services are offered through financial advisers: WealthConductor\u2019s IncomeConductor and Andes Wealth Technologies\u2019 \u201cGoogle Maps for Financial Advisors.\u201d More on these three shortly.\n\nThe Finovate conference also featured a lineup of panels about \u201cwealthtech and investech.\u201d In his Finovate article, Investment News tech writer Ryan W. Neal wrote that \u201cjust a few years ago you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a single [fintech] startup that knew what a financial adviser does.\u201d I\u2019d add that \u201cwealthtech\u201d also isn\u2019t a word used to describe starting-out millennials; it\u2019s more appropriate for Gen Xers and boomers in their 50s and beyond.\n\nThe growing fintech interest in older Americans reminded me of what I saw a few months back at the Silicon Valley Boomer Venture Summit. There, an impressive group of tech companies described their products and services aimed at older Americans \u2014 a demographic that Silicon Valley has largely ignored in the past.\n\nKindur\u2019s Retirement Paycheck\n\nKindur\u2019s Retirement Paycheck, which launched in April 2019, features what the company calls \u201ca personalized retirement plan\u201d to develop a set of recommendations to build a \u201cRetirement Paycheck.\u201d Its average client is someone age 61 who plans to retire in a few years.\n\nAlso read: What I wish I knew when I retired\n\nThe basic plan is free and offers a retirement income plan and a review of it with a financial adviser; a Social Security optimizer and retirement health care cost projections. For a 0.5% annual fee, you also get access to a financial adviser; low-fee exchange-traded funds and automated retirement income management.\n\nKindur founder and CEO Rhian Horgan \u2014 a former managing director at JP Morgan Chase \u2014 said she started the company after talking to her father about his retirement.\n\n\u201cOur conversation shifted from \u2018When would he retire?\u2019 to \u201cHow would he retire?\u2019 I became surprised how complex modern retirement is, so I set out to help him and other boomers retire fearlessly.\u201d\n\nIn her presentation describing prototypical Kindur customers \u201cFred\u201d and Fay,\u201d Horgan tweaked the Finovate audience, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re typical boomers thinking about starting to retire. Surprising to many of you in the room, they know how to use technology.\u201d\n\nFred and Fay have been trying to navigate Social Security, figure their cost of health care in retirement and \u201ccrack the code of retirement income,\u201d Horgan said.\n\nAlso on MarketWatch: The retirement plan of the future: turning that pot of money into monthly income\n\nShe added that there are \u201cplenty of strategies to help boomers prepare for retirement accumulate wealth; spending money in retirement requires a completely different set of strategies.\u201d\n\nToo often, Horgan noted, boomers are \u201cforced to become experts in fields they haven\u2019t been experts in before\u201d \u2014 making Social Security claiming calculations, understanding Medicare coverage and the like. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex retirement cocktail,\u201d she said.\n\nKindur asks users about their spending and savings goals for retirement, lets them consolidate their investment accounts and helps them build a retirement plan based on their goals. If customers want, Kindur will deliver guaranteed income from their savings through a commission-free fixed annuity from American Equity, an insurer rated A- by A.M. Best and Standard & Poor\u2019s.\n\nThe Retirement Paycheck tool also helps users draw down their retirement income monthly in a tax-efficient manner. \u201cWe automate their retirement paycheck to relive the experience of having a paycheck preretirement,\u201d said Horgan.\n\nWealthConductor\u2019s IncomeConductor\n\nIncomeConductor, from three-year old WealthConductor, is designed to help financial advisers become experts at retirement income generation for their clients. Its web-based software creates, tracks and manages retirement income plans.\n\nRelated: How much would people take out of retirement accounts if left on their own?\n\nUsing what I\u2019d consider some hyperbole, CEO Sheryl O\u2019Connor told the Finovate crowd that IncomeConductor \u201callows customized written financial plans with the certainty that clients won\u2019t run out of money.\u201d\n\nWealthConductor trains advisers on how to use IncomeConductor. Then, the advisers use the program to show clients their annual expense needs in retirement and their sources of income as well as how to invest their retirement savings based on their age.\n\n\u201cWe deliver peace of mind, and that\u2019s priceless at the end of the day,\u201d said O\u2019Connor.\n\nAndes Wealth Technologies\n\nSomewhat similar to IncomeConductor, Andes Wealth Technologies offers a personalized wealth management approach.\n\nWith the tagline \u201cWhere Behavioral Finance Meets Analytics,\u201d the company\u2019s Real-Time Risk Monitor lets financial advisers visualize and communicate investment risk for clients; its Risk Tolerance Test and behavioral surveys help clients understand how much investment risk they can tolerate and its Cognitive Ability Test lets advisers know if their clients are having cognitive issues that could impede their ability to make wise personal finance decisions.\n\nHelen Yang, Andes Wealth Management\u2019s founder and CEO, said her service uses investment personas for each client based on MIT research.\n\n\u201cWe are at the end of a bull market,\u201d Yang warned, adding, \u201cthe relationship between risk and return varies over time and you have to stay on top of it.\u201d", "description": "One offers an income plan, a Social Security optimizer and retirement health care cost projections.", "authors": ["Richard Eisenberg"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT455_na_ret_ZG_20191016170704.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
