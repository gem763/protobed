When we protect our nation from foreign influence, we abide by their wishes.\n\nGeorge Washington\u2019s 1796 farewell address contained a forceful warning \u201cagainst the insidious wiles of foreign influence, the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.\u201d\n\nThe first three presidents of the United States were deeply concerned about protecting our country from foreign interference, intrigue and influence. You should be, too.\n\nNine years earlier, in 1787, this fear of foreign influence was on the minds of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams as they crafted the Constitution, with Adams agreeing with Jefferson that they were wise to be \u201capprehensive of foreign interference, intrigue and influence.\u201d Our Founding Fathers also were conscious of the violent way Europeans overthrew their corrupt kinds, and they wanted to spare our country that violent upheaval by including lawful, civil impeachment in our Constitution. Impeachment is an extreme remedy only used when the president subverts the Constitution and the rule of law, as President Donald Trump is doing by welcoming foreign countries into our elections.\n\nAn invitation to Russia\n\nAs chair of the Democratic Party in 2016, I witnessed firsthand the chaos unleashed when Russia interfered with and influenced the outcome of the election. It\u2019s happening again, and the sequel is a lot scarier than the original.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s not cyberattack by the Russian military with the social media propaganda that followed, it\u2019s the commander in chief of the United States inviting a foreign power to interfere with our elections, with reports of him stating that he wasn't bothered by Russia\u2019s interference in 2016 and would accept it again in the 2020 election.\n\nHe's wrong: Trump has no right to confront the whistleblower who triggered an impeachment inquiry\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake is not just who wins the White House next year.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake is the same issue that greatly concerned Washington, Jefferson, Adams and Alexander Hamilton: safeguarding our democracy from foreign interference, intrigue and influence.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo/epa-EFE)\n\nAccording to a new Monmouth University poll, only 4 in 10 Republicans say Trump \"probably did\" ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son \u2014 despite Trump confessing to having done so.\n\nAnd, even more shockingly, the poll found that 29% of Republicans said Trump \"probably did not\" \u2014 again, despite Trump admitting that he had.\n\nOur president wants us to believe he leaned on Ukraine\u2019s president because he\u2019s concerned about corruption. And this self-proclaimed \u201cvery stable genius\u201d expects us to believe that a congressional investigation into his impeachable behavior is \u201ctreason\u201d \u2014 a \u201choax,\u201d a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nToday, we the people need to do our part in safeguarding our principles of democracy by ensuring free and fair elections. We need to pay attention. We need to listen and learn \u2014 and believe what we hear with our own ears.\n\nBeware of Trump\u2019s smokescreen and his attempts to distract us from the truth. He would have you believe that what is a question of our democracy, our national security and the sanctity of our elections is just a treasonous figment of the Democratic Party\u2019s imagination.\n\nThe American people are watching these proceedings\n\nNevertheless, this time I believe we the people are paying attention, listening and learning. A CNN average of polls about support for impeachment shows that 51% of Americans favor an impeachment inquiry. Americans understand that our democracy is in peril, and that we must ask all of our elected officials to protect us by protecting our democracy.\n\nVeteran GOP consultant Mike Murphy said recently that he was told by a Republican senator that 30 Republican senators, a majority, would vote to impeach Trump if they could do so anonymously.\n\nGOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah called Trump\u2019s actions \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Trump's call to investigate his political rival Biden were \u201ccompletely inappropriate.\u201d This seems like a small movement, but it is the first sign that senators are beginning to question the president\u2019s actions, encouraged by one of their former colleagues. Former GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona wrote an op-ed asking \u201cmy fellow Republicans\u201d in Congress to not support Trump in 2020, telling them they have a moral obligation \u201cto risk your careers in favor of your principles\u201d and \u201cput America first.\u201d He also noted that \u201cthe president's actions warrant impeachment.\u201d\n\nWhen Donald Trump implied that any move to oust him from office amounted to \u201ctreason\u201d and could spark a civil war, Illinois GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a former Air Force pilot, tweeted, \u201cI have visited nations ravaged by civil war. ... I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a president. This is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans in Congress must abandon him now if they care about our country & have any hope of salvaging a political future for GOP,\u201d warned former CIA Director John Brennan, who served five U.S. presidents. \u201cDonald Trump, time after time after time, continues to show how unfit he is for office.\u201d\n\nImpeachment isn't just about Trump: It's about stopping the Republicans who enabled him.\n\nWhile both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin make jokes about Russia\u2019s interference in our elections, ask yourself two questions as you watch the upcoming impeachment proceedings:\n\n1. Are the charges true?\n\n2. Are they weighty enough to justify impeaching the president?\n\nAt the time the Constitution was ratified in 1788, our Founding Fathers regarded impeachment as an improvement over the violent methods often used in Europe to get rid of corrupt rulers.\n\nToday, we the people need to do our part in safeguarding fair elections free of the foreign interference that our Founding Fathers so forcefully warned us about.\n\nWe can\u2019t undo the damage of 2016. But we can learn from it. Our democracy depends on it.\n\nDonna Brazile, a Fox News contributor and an at-large automatic delegate to the 2020 Democratic convention, is the former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee and author of \"Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House.\" Follow her on Twitter: @donnabrazile\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
