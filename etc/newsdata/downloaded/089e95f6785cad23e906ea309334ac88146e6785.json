(AP) - After getting sacked an NFL-leading 51 times in 2018, Raiders quarterback Derek Carr fully appreciated his offensive line following a dominant performance in Oakland\u2019s season-opening win over Denver.\n\n\u201cIt makes a world of difference, I\u2019ll just leave it at that,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI\u2019m going to look terrible if they aren\u2019t at their best, because I need their help. I need them to be at their best so I can be at my best.\u201d\n\nIt was only the second time in 10 career games that the Broncos failed to sack Carr. The other came during his rookie season in 2014.\n\nParticularly impressive was the job done by tackles Kolton Miller and Trent Brown, who shut down Denver pass-rush specialists Bradley Chubb and Von Miller.\n\nFor Brown, it was validation after signing a $66 million, four-year contract in the offseason that made him the highest-paid tackle in NFL history.\n\nFor Miller, who spent his evening stonewalling Chubb, it was redemption after an injury-plagued rookie season that had some questioning his value as the 15th overall pick a year ago.\n\n\u201cI had a blast,\u201d Miller said Thursday. \u201cJust let it loose. Coming on out top was really fun. We really ran the ball well, had a lot of inside zone and threw in some play-action. It was a combination of everyone doing their job. It made it a lot easier in the passing game.\u201d\n\nMiller started all season at left tackle last year, when he battled right knee and elbow injuries. Miller ended up allowing a league-high 16 sacks, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nThe Raiders say that the game against Chubb is more indicative of Miller\u2019s talent, even though it is a small sample size.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only played one game,\u201d coach Jon Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got (Kansas City\u2019s) Frank Clark this game, one of the premier rushers in football. He\u2019s just stronger, he\u2019s more experienced, he\u2019s healthy. Those are three things that have taken his game to another level and he\u2019s got to continue to prove it every week.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos pressured Carr on only five plays, according to Pro Football Focus, while Chubb had a 10% success rate in pass-rush situations against Miller.\n\nOakland\u2019s quarterback said he knew things would be different for Miller when the team gathered in training camp.\n\n\u201cHe looks like the guy that when he first showed up we were like, \u2018Oh, shoot,\u2019\u201d Carr said. \u201cThe way he could bend being that tall and stuff like that, it\u2019s unbelievable. And he looked noticeably stronger. You could see his punch was a little harder. He could sit down and hold a little bit more weight on the bull rush and things like that. It was noticeable how much better he was.\u201d\n\nNote: Cornerback Gareon Conley, who left Monday\u2019s game on a stretcher, is expected to play against the Chiefs on Sunday. Conley is listed as limited, although defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said Conley was a full participant in practice.\n\n__\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After getting sacked an NFL-leading 51 times in 2018, Raiders quarterback Derek Carr fully appreciated his offensive line following a dominant performance in Oakland's season-opening win over Denver.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Wagaman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/broncos_raiders_football_51098_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
