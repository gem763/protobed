So, yeah, he\u2019s pretty good,\u201d LaFleur said of his star quarterback Rodgers.\n\nRodgers completed all but six passing attempts, connecting for a 74-yard touchdown with receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling halfway through the fourth quarter at Lambeau Field.\n\nHe helped swing the game late in the first half by hitting Jake Kumerow with a 37 yard touchdown pass and then wasting no time getting on the board early in the third with a drive that was capped by the quarterback\u2019s three yard run to extend the Packers lead to 28-10.\n\nOakland dropped to 3-3 on the season as they are in the midst of a miserable six week stretch of no home games. They had a bye last week.\n\nWith Green Bay having just taken a 14-10 lead, the Raiders offense got into scoring position on a 48-yard catch by tight end Darren Waller to the Packers three yard line.\n\nBut Oakland quarterback Derek Carr fumbled the ball on the goal line and it bounced out of the end zone, resulting in a turnover and touchback for the Packers.\n\nGreen Bay took advantage with a touchdown and potential 14-point swing on Rodgers\u2019 long touchdown pass to Kumerow and run down the sideline with 12 seconds left in the half.\n\nThe Packers got the ball back to start the second half. On the first play from scrimmage, Rodgers connected with Valdes-Scantling for a gain of 59 yards. That set the stage for Rodgers to ramble into the end zone for his running touchdown.\n\n\u201cI think this was the most complete that I\u2019ve played,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI felt good about the timing. There was a lot of balls thrown on time, and obviously the line played fantastic.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Robbie Gould kicked three field goals and the San Francisco 49ers remained undefeated with a 9-0 victory over the Redskins in Washington, where heavy rain and wind made for treacherous field conditions.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s defense allowed just 154 yards and the 49ers are off to their first 6-0 start since Joe Montana led the team to a 10-start in 1990.\n\nIn Indianapolis, Jacoby Brissett completed 26 of 39 passes for a career-high 326 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Colts to a 30-23 win over the Houston Texans in a battle for first in the AFC South.\n\nZach Pascal caught six passes for 106 yards and two touchdowns for the Colts, who improved to 4-2 on the season.\n\nAlso, Todd Gurley caught a touchdown pass in his return and the Los Angeles Rams defense was stellar in a 37-10 victory against the Atlanta Falcons, who potentially lost their star quarterback.\n\nFalcons signal-caller Matt Ryan was 16 of 27 for 159 yards before he was knocked out of the game with a right ankle injury early in the fourth quarter on a sack by Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Aaron Rodgers delivered a masterful performance, throwing five touchdowns and running for another as the Green Bay Packers", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/79dcd4_aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-calls-play-in-oakland-raiders-lambeau-field-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
