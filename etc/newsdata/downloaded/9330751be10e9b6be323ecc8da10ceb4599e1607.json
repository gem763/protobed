Sign up here.\n\nThe head of Mexico\u2019s army claimed Friday that the operation to capture one of El Chapo\u2019s sons was planned without approval from the country\u2019s top army officials and bungled by the local police forces who carried it out.\n\n\n\nLuis Crescencio Sandoval said at a press conference that the security cabinet ordered the withdrawal of forces from the house in Culiac\u00e1n where they found Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez after a gun battle with drug cartel members. \u201cThe negative effects of this precipitous and poorly planned action resulted in 19 street checkpoints [by the cartel] and 14 firefights with the Army and National Guard,\u201d he said. Mexico\u2019s president and public security secretary said that the operation was ended to protect the safety of the soldiers involved.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear exactly what happened Thursday afternoon and evening in Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of Mexico\u2019s northwestern Sinaloa state. But the bid to arrest 28-year-old Ovidio, the drug kingpin's son who's been indicted in the U.S., devolved into gun battles in the street and prompted a near citywide lockdown. Sources, including one U.S. law enforcement official, told VICE News that Mexican military captured Ovidio and then released him after an attack by the cartel.\n\nPhotos of Ovidio showed him in custody, but he was eventually set free. Unconfirmed reports suggest Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n, El Chapo\u2019s eldest son, may have also been captured and released. Ovidio and Iv\u00e1n lead a faction of the powerful Sinaloa cartel now that their father is serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison.\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Gonzalez Mesa, a lawyer in Mexico who represents the Guzm\u00e1n family, told VICE News he will hold a press conference at 2 p.m. local time in Mexico City to publicly thank Mexican President Lopez Obrador for releasing Ovidio.\n\nGonzalez Mesa said he would hold the press conference at a press club in the city's historic center, adding insult to injury for the president, who's already embarrassed by the growing scandal over the botched capture operation. Asked whether El Chapo's family was aware of his plans for the press conference, Gonzalez Mesa replied, \u201cBut of course.\"\n\nMexican security secretary Alfonso Durazo said at a press conference that 30 soldiers from the army and National Guard were patrolling Culiac\u00e1n when someone shot at them from inside a house. The soldiers found Ovidio inside the house, but they ended up letting him go after being surrounded by gunmen who had \u201ca greater force,\u201d Durazo said.\n\n\u201cWith the goal of safeguarding the well-being and tranquillity of Culiac\u00e1n society, officials in the security cabinet decided to suspend the actions,\u201d Durazo said.\n\nLopez Obrador said his Cabinet ultimately decided to call off the operation because of the threat the cartel posed to the general population. \u201cThey took decisions that I backed, that I endorse, because the situation turned very difficult because many citizens, many people, were at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was decided to protect people\u2019s lives, and I was in agreement with that. It\u2019s not about massacres. We can\u2019t value the capture of one delinquent over the lives of the people.\u201d\n\nCrist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda, the public safety director for the state of Sinaloa, reportedly told a Mexican television station that people were wounded as a result of the shootout but didn\u2019t confirm whether there were any deaths.\n\nKeegan Hamilton contributed reporting.\n\nCover: Mexican police patrol in a street of Culiacan, state of Sinaloa, Mexico, on October 17, 2019, after heavily armed gunmen in four-by-four trucks fought an intense battle with Mexican security forces.
