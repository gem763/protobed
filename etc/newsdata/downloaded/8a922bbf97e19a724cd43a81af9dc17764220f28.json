Congratulations to South Africa, I thought they played very well up front.\n\n\"We probably gave away too many penalties in our own half and that cost us dearly but I'm proud of the fact that we never gave up and got ourselves back into that game and we were in the arm wrestle.\n\n\"Two or three scrum penalties, a couple of line-out penalties are disappointing and that's the difference between the two teams.\n\n\"We punch massively above our weight when you consider the playing size of numbers in Wales so I'm really proud of these guys.\n\n\"They gave 100 per cent. It was a tough, physical South Africa team that we played against. Our guys didn't take a backward step and I can only be proud of them for that.\n\n\"At 16-all it was pretty close and you're sort of dreaming about the three points being the other way but like I said, congratulations to South Africa and I think it will be a great final between England and South Africa.\"", "description": "WALES 16-19 SOUTH AFRICA: The Springboks have ended Wales' World Cup dream for the second successive tournament", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734944.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rugby-World-Cup-Semi-Final-Wales-v-South-Africa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
