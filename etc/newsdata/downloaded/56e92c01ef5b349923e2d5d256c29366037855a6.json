Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.\n\nFirst of all, we'll work out how to calculate ROCE. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. And finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities are impacting its ROCE.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.\n\nSo, How Do We Calculate ROCE?\n\nAnalysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\nOr for ST International Holdings:\n\n0.17 = HK$26m \u00f7 (HK$211m - HK$59m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)\n\nSo, ST International Holdings has an ROCE of 17%.\n\nView our latest analysis for ST International Holdings\n\nIs ST International Holdings's ROCE Good?\n\nROCE is commonly used for comparing the performance of similar businesses.

ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. If ST International Holdings is cyclical, it could make sense to check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nHow ST International Holdings's Current Liabilities Impact Its ROCE\n\nLiabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. The ROCE equation subtracts current liabilities from capital employed, so a company with a lot of current liabilities appears to have less capital employed, and a higher ROCE than otherwise. To check the impact of this, we calculate if a company has high current liabilities relative to its total assets.\n\nST International Holdings has total liabilities of HK$59m and total assets of HK$211m. Therefore its current liabilities are equivalent to approximately 28% of its total assets. A fairly low level of current liabilities is not influencing the ROCE too much.", "description": "Today we'll look at ST International Holdings Company Limited (HKG:8521) and reflect on its potential as an...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u_PZhC0PoafFdVJByfg1LA--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/5aaeab2b00327779879f8de1b843e67e", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
