Those products are popular with younger plumbers embracing new technology rather than soldering traditional brass fittings.\n\nThe John Guest acquisition delivers a business that is strong in Europe with plastic push-to-connect fittings. The company operates three manufacturing sites in the UK and generated profit margins of more than 30 per cent from sales of 145 million fittings in calendar 2017, mainly under the John Guest and Speedfit brands.\n\nSharemarket darling\n\nThe robust growth from the pioneering push-to-connect range, which is sold in US hardware retailers Lowes and Home Depot, has enabled Reliance to become a sharemarket darling since it listed with an issue price of $2.50. The Munz family undertook a partial selldown in August 2017 from 30 per cent to 10 per cent at a price of $3.55 in a large block trade. The family collected $919 million when Reliance listed in 2016.\n\nBut while the sharp rise in the Reliance share price on Monday \u2013 when it gained almost 23 per cent \u2013 has delivered extra wealth to Reliance shareholders, the vendors of John Guest in the northern hemisphere are also enjoying a windfall from the sale.\n\nReliance Worldwide keeps delivering for the Munz family, who built it up from 1986 and then listed it on the ASX in 2016.\n\nJohn Guest was owned by three brothers, Robert, Barry and Tim Guest, and their families. The company had been founded by their father, John Guest, who died in 2010 at the age of 83. Mr Guest snr was an engineer who started the company in 1961. Reliance was successful in a sale process this time, after the John Guest owners scrapped a previous process two years earlier.\n\nReliance retail shareholders will have a chance to share in the spoils under a retail entitlement offer, which closes on June 14.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReliance chief executive Heath Sharp said the institutional entitlement offer had been strongly supported \u2013 eligible institutions had taken up more than 98 per cent of the new shares available to them. A shortfall bookbuild had been \"significantly oversubscribed\".\n\nThose new shares are to start trading on the ASX on June 5.\n\nThe John Guest buyout has marked the second major global plumbing industry acquisition by an Australian firm in the past months.
