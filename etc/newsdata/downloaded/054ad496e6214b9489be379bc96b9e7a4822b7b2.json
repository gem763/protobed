The move paid off when Vidal\u2019s pass was blasted in by Luis Su\u00e1rez, who scored again in the 2-1 win.\n\nValverde doubled down on that change Sunday night at Camp Nou, when he left Busquets on the bench while starting Vidal in a 4-0 Spanish league win against Sevilla.\n\nVidal came through even more this time, providing muscle and hustle in the midfield and scored a goal which helped to put the result beyond doubt before halftime.\n\nHis inclusion in the starting 11 meant Frenkie de Jong shifted back into Busquet\u2019s holding position. De Jong worked hard to do his best Busquets imitation, thrilling the crowd with a fancy spin move to escape two defenders and keep possession.\n\nBusquets came on as a substitute in the second half with the game wrapped up.\n\nThe 32-year-old Vidal joined Barcelona before last season from Bayern Munich. The Chile midfielder has won league titles with Bayern in Germany, with Juventus in Italy, and in Spain last season.\n\n\u201cI would have liked to play more games, but we have a lot of midfielders,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here to do my part, to be important, to help the team at every moment, and fortunately I was able to score today.\u201d\n\nValverde also left Antoine Griezmann on the bench after he had started every game since joining Barcelona from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid last summer. Griezmann has scored three times but otherwise has seemed out of sync with his teammates for long stretches of games.\n\nOusmane Dembele took his place and scored before the break. He was later sent off with a direct red after saying the referee was \u201cvery bad.\u201d That means Griezmann will likely be back next round.\n\nVAR DISPUTE\n\nLegan\u00e9s club president Victoria Pav\u00f3n has asked for her club\u2019s match against Levante on Saturday to be replayed after a dispute regarding the league\u2019s VAR.\n\nPav\u00f3n claimed that \u201cwe know the VAR was not working correctly\u201d during Legan\u00e9s 2-1 home loss. Her club said it had knowledge that the video review booth was not able to communicate with on-field officials after a penalty was awarded to Levante when Dimitrios Siovas fouled Roger Mart\u00ed.\n\nThe league issued a statement saying that Pav\u00f3n was incorrect and that \u201cthere was no technical problem with the VAR during the (penalty) in the 44th minute.\u201d It added that it would make the video and audio from the VAR available for both clubs to consult.\n\nReplays on television appear to clearly show that Mart\u00ed was outside the area when fouled.\n\nThis is the second season that the Spanish league has used video review.\n\nDEATH THREATS\n\nValencia says it has contacted police to report death threats received by club president Anil Murthy via his mobile phone.\n\nValencia\u2019s fans have been angry at the club and owner Peter Lim for firing successful coach Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral last month due to a disagreement over the lack of signings in the offseason.\n\nMany fans attending Valencia\u2019s 2-1 win over Alav\u00e9s on Saturday loudly jeered Lim and Murthy.\n\nMurthy replied by holding a finger up to his lips and pointing to the field.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Coach Ernesto Valverde has shaken up the player hierarchy at Barcelona by daring to leave Sergio Busquets on the bench.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/spain_soccer_la_liga_30686_c0-147-3500-2187_s1770x1032.jpg?9f0ec6102a60103340cada258795c99dcb54d28c", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
