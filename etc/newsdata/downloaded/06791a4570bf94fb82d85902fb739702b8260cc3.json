Wales\u2019 tournament record is Shane Williams\u2019 six in France in 2007.\n\nAdams said: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be bad to join that list, would it? There are some legends there. It\u2019s always nice to get a try. I\u2019m obviously happy to get another one.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s five now and I was told Shane is the record holder for Wales at a World Cup with six. Fingers crossed with three more games to go hopefully I can pip him. We\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d\n\nAfter wins over Georgia, Australia, Fiji and Uruguay, Wales face France for a place in the World Cup semi-finals. They have beaten Les Bleus in seven of their last eight matches.\n\nWales captain Alun Wyn Jones has told his team-mates they are 240 minutes from sealing a place in the history books for which they will be remembered forever.\n\nAdams said: \u201cWhen you say it like that it does put it into perspective a little bit, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s extremely exciting.\n\n\u201cYou could argue it\u2019s the biggest week of my career so far with playing in a World Cup quarter-final. I\u2019d never have said I\u2019d be standing here telling you that 18 months ago.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason why this group of players can\u2019t achieve something special. We\u2019ve got belief in each other and we\u2019re all really excited moving forward now.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a really tough 80 minutes on Sunday and hopefully I can get out there and do everybody proud.\u201d\n\nAdams has had a remarkable start to his Test career since his February 2018 debut.\n\nHe has gone from Test rookie to a key international figure in the space of 18 months and has nine tries in 18 Test appearances. Adams has taken to rugby\u2019s biggest stage with ease.\n\nWales have been boosted by the news key backs Dan Biggar, Jonathan Davies and George North are set to be fit to face France after injuries.\n\nAdams said: \u201cFrance are renowned for being able to turn it on and when they do they\u2019re extremely dangerous. They\u2019ve got some quality players.\n\n\u201cAt times in this competition they\u2019ve looked really, really good. They definitely pose a threat to us without a doubt.\u201d\n\n(Image: Ben Evans/Huw Evans Agency)\n\nFrance threw away a 16-0 half-time lead to lose to Wales in the Six Nations and have a big concern over scrum-half Antoine Dupont, who is struggling with a back injury.\n\nLes Bleus won\u2019t have played for two weeks by the time they face Wales in Oita on Sunday after their last pool clash with England was abandoned due to Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nFrance playmaker Romain Ntamack said: \u201cWe start matches strongly and have the opportunity to kill teams off, but we don\u2019t and they come back. Our first-half success leaves us.\n\n\u201cWe have to correct that and we\u2019ll correct it this weekend. We had a great first half against Wales in the Six Nations. We put them in trouble. We have to use that as our working base.\u201d", "description": "The Cardiff Blues winger impressed during the Pool stage of the tournament and is looking to continue his fine form in Sunday's quarter-final against France", "authors": ["Alex Bywater", "Image", "Pa", "Afp Getty Images", "Ben Evans Huw Evans Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20156051.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rugby-World-Cup-2019-Pool-D-Wales-v-Georgia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
