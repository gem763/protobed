(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\n\nAn unprecedented intentional blackout is affecting hundreds of thousands of people across central and northern California for a second straight day Thursday, with more outages possible in southern California as desiccating offshore Santa Ana winds ramp up, along with an extreme wildfire risk.\n\nThe latest forecasts from the National Weather Service show Red Flag warnings continuing in most areas, from the San Francisco Bay region down to San Diego through at least Friday as the weather pattern favors powerful, dry winds blowing offshore. If any fires were to ignite in such conditions, they would be likely to exhibit extreme fire behavior, spread quickly and be difficult to impossible to quickly contain.\n\nStorm Prediction Center (SPC) Fire Wx Outlook.

(Noah Berger/AP)\n\nThe PG&E blackouts can be viewed as an extreme example of a climate change adaptation measure and one that will have large costs and unintended consequences.\n\nOne of the most robust conclusions of climate change research is that wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent and severe in large parts of the American west as the climate warms, particularly in California. This is occurring as summers become hotter and drier and precipitation becomes more variable in the winter, with lurches from drought to flood and back again becoming the norm.\n\nFor example, the National Climate Assessment, an authoritative report published by the Trump administration in 2017, cited evidence showing that the cumulative forest area burned by wildfires in the Southwest between 1984 to 2015 doubled due to climate change-related factors.\n\n[They lived through California\u2019s two worst fires \u2014 and now face a future of blackouts]\n\nIn an indication that an uptick in large wildfires is already occurring in California, 15 of the top 20 largest wildfires in state history have all occurred since the year 2000.\n\nComputer model projections show huge increases in wildfire frequency and size in California as well as other parts of the southwest if greenhouse gas emissions continue largely unabated. In addition to climate change, population growth and the increase in homes and businesses located near lands that typically burn, known as the wildland-urban interface, are also playing a part in escalating the risk of and damage from wildfires in the Golden State.\n\nAny new fire ignitions today through Friday will have the potential for very rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior with a threat to life and property. Everyone is urged to avoid or use extreme caution with potential fire ignition sources. #cawx #LAWeather #Socal pic.twitter.com/JFmL1BDPgR \u2014 NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles) October 10, 2019\n\nThe state has established the most ambitious climate policy targets in the country, but the consequences of global warming are already here, and increasingly obvious. Since 2010, for example, California residents have dealt with the most severe drought in at least 1,200 years, followed by record wet conditions and back-to-back devastating and deadly wildfire seasons in 2017 and 2018.\n\nFire experts have warned conditions are conducive to major wildfires given an unusually wet winter that provided a boost to vegetation growth, followed by an unusually hot dry season that dried vegetation out.\n\nThe question facing California lawmakers, power company officials and ordinary residents is what to do now that wildfire risks are escalating and vulnerable infrastructure has proved to be a cause of massive, deadly blazes? The answer this time is to impose power cuts that in many areas are going to last several days, but this is not likely to be practical in the long run, given that parts of California see several such strong wind events each fall.\n\n\u201cMy personal view is that this is basically a trial-and-error situation,\u201d said Steve Bowen, a meteorologist at Aon, the reinsurance giant.\n\n\u201cThe last two years have really changed how we view wildfire risk. There is a lot of brainstorming among many sectors right now to determine how to best mitigate the societal risks since we know wildfire seasons and resultant impacts have grown over time due to climate change influence[s] and human migration patterns,\u201d Bowen said. He pointed out that shutting down power lines only eliminates one ignition source, with lightning and human activity remaining as major threats.\n\n\u201c \u2026 The temporary suspension of power is just one potential solution to many threats that exist,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile it is unclear what the losses will be and who will be responsible for paying them, it is possible the costs of the blackouts alone \u2014 even if not a single major blaze results from the ongoing high wind event \u2014 will still come close to and may even exceed $1 billion., according to news reports.", "description": "\"Critical\" fire weather conditions prompted the main California electric utility to shut down more power lines on Thursday in a desperate bid to prevent wildfires.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "October At Pm", "Andrew Freedman Edits", "Reports On Weather", "Extreme Weather", "Climate Science For Capital Weather Gang.
