I am here to ask that we do not forget them today, on National Period Day, or any day.\u201d\n\nNadya Okamoto, a 21-year-old junior at Harvard University and cofounder of nonprofit advocacy group PERIOD, helped launch the series of rallies across the country.\n\n\u201cPeriod poverty disproportionately affects people in low-income households,\u201d Okamoto said of a report that found 46 percent of low-income women had to choose between a meal and period products. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about periods. This is about gender equality and fighting for global development.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2018 poll by Always, a menstrual products company, nearly 1 in 5 girls nationwide have left school early or stayed home due to lack of access to period supplies.\n\nAs a 16-year-old, Okamoto was outraged by the notion that comfort while menstruating was a luxury. It\u2019s a basic human right, she argues, which motivated her to found PERIOD in 2014 with a friend in Portland, Oregon. The organization has registered over 400 campus chapters in all 50 states and in over 30 countries.\n\nIn the last few months, PERIOD chapters passed about 12 pieces of policy at the local and state level for schools, but they\u2019re eyeing nationwide change. PERIOD has two primary demands: provide period products to all \u2014 specifically in public schools and prisons \u2014 and eliminate the tampon tax.\n\nThe latter, often called the \u201cpink tax,\u201d refers to a sales tax in 34 states on menstrual products, which classify them as non-essential items rather than hygiene products, which are typically exempt from the tax and include items such as Rogaine and Viagra.\n\nTwo women hold signs at the National Period Day rally in front of the Capitol Building. | Abbey Marshall/POLITICO\n\nWashington, D.C., abolished the tampon tax in 2018, but Nina Sarhan, the D.C. rally organizer, felt it important to present PERIOD\u2019s policy demands to the most powerful lawmakers in the country.\n\n\u201cIn D.C., we\u2019re focusing on highlighting those most vulnerable to period poverty,\u201d Sarhan said. \u201cPeriod poverty is so pervasive and hits so many intersections, but it\u2019s harder for our trans and immigrant families.\u201d\n\nThe event\u2019s corporate sponsor, Seventh Generation, a menstrual products manufacturer, launched an ongoing charitable co-venture to donate 43 cents from every pack of period products \u2014 roughly the cost of the pink tax \u2014 to PERIOD and other grassroots movements fighting menstrual inequality.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s really important that the industry really steps up,\u201d said Ashley Orgain, Seventh Generation\u2019s global director of advocacy and sustainability. \u201cThis is an opportunity to raise that issue. Having access and information is something that is just a human right.\u201d\n\nAs the rally drew to a close, Okamoto vowed that the fight was just beginning. The organization plans to continue legislation advocacy and lobbying ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThis is the power of young people mobilizing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe change policy, but we can also change culture. This is a real and urgent issue that constituents will care about and rally around.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/21/63b4c69040eca42b9cc3caf77aa2/191019-lynette-medley-politico-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
