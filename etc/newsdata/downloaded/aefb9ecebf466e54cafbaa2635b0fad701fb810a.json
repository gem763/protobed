Today, seven out of 10 people who have a heart attack will survive.\n\nBut women are missing out, says Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF).\n\n\"Heart attacks have never been more treatable.\n\n\"Yet women are dying needlessly because heart attacks are often seen as a man's disease, and women don't receive the same standard of treatment as men.\"\n\nShe said studies had \"revealed inequalities at every stage of a woman's medical journey, and although complex to dissect, they suggest unconscious biases are limiting the survival chances of women\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe BHF report says that each year around 35,000 women are admitted to hospital following a heart attack in the UK each year - an average of 98 women a day, or four per hour.\n\nIn the UK, women are twice as likely to die from coronary heart disease as from breast cancer.\n\nThe report found that:\n\nwomen often delayed seeking help\n\nthey were more likely to receive an incorrect diagnosis and substandard treatment compared to men\n\nrisk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, increase heart attack chances more in women\n\nthe quality of aftercare was also substandard\n\nChris Gale, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Leeds, led a study which found that thousands of women's lives were needlessly lost in England and Wales after heart attacks, between 2002 and 2013.\n\n\"This problem is not unique to the UK,\" he said.\n\n\"Studies across the globe have also revealed gender gaps in treatment, suggesting this is a deeply entrenched and complex issue.\n\n\"On their own, the differences in care are very small, but when we look at this across the population of the UK, it adds up to a significant loss of life.\n\n\"We can do better.\"\n\nWhat are heart attack symptoms?\n\nHeart attack symptoms can vary from person to person, but the most common signs of a heart attack are:\n\nCentral chest pain or discomfort in your chest which suddenly occurs and doesn't go away\n\nIt may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing\n\nPain which radiates down your left arm, or both arms, or to your neck, jaw, back or stomach\n\nFeeling sick, sweaty, light-headed or short of breath\n\nCall 999 if you recognise these symptoms.\n\nNHS advice says the pain can often be mild and mistaken for indigestion.", "description": "Thousands of women are dying needlessly because of delays in diagnosis and poor care, a report says.", "authors": ["Dominic Hughes", "Health Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/49FA/production/_108883981_gettyimages-505082277.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
