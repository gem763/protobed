REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nIn a letter to Defence Secretary Mark Esper, the heads of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee and one of it subcommittees said that while initial reports indicated that only one U.S. military crew had stayed at President Donald Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort southeast of Glasgow, the Pentagon had now turned over data indicating \u201cmore than three dozen separate stays\u201d since Trump moved into the White House.\n\nCommittee Chairman Elijah Cummings and Representative Jamie Raskin, who chairs the civil rights subcommittee, said that while the Defence Department had not given Congress information about the total number of rooms it had booked at the resort, it did say the average cost of a room for U.S. service personnel between August 2017 and July 2019 was $189 per night.\n\nThey said the Pentagon had also informed them that during that time period, Pentagon expenditures \u201cspecifically associated with the Trump Turnberry ... amounted to $124,578.96.\u201d\n\nIf the Pentagon figures on the total costs are accurate, the lawmakers said, \u201cit appears that U.S. taxpayer funds were used to purchase the equivalent of more than 659 rooms at the Trump Turnberry just since August 2017 - or the equivalent of one room every night for more than one-and-a-half years.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment, a Pentagon spokeswoman said: \u201cAs with all congressional correspondence, we will respond directly to the authors of the letter.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers said their estimate did not include another $59,729 in \u201cunspecified charges to government travel cards\u201d as well as $16.6 million in fuel purchased by the U.S. military at nearby Prestwick Airport between Jan. 20, 2017, and June 21, 2019.\n\nThe congressmen said they were concerned the department had refused to turn over communications with \u201coutside entities\u201d about Turnberry or Prestwick Airport, and instead had referred their inquiries to the White House.\n\nIn a recent exchange in Scotland\u2019s regional parliament, a Liberal Democrat member, Mike Rumbles, asked Scotland\u2019s government to confirm how much money Prestwick Airport had received from the U.S. military for its operations, and whether the government could confirm news reports that the Pentagon provided the airport\u2019s \u201clargest single income stream.\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s Transport Minister, Michael Matheson, responded that Prestwick Airport had been used by military units since the 1930s for \u201cstopovers and refuelling.\u201d\n\nMatheson said the airport itself \u201cgenerally\u201d only booked rooms for the U.S. military at Trump\u2019s resort if other hotels were unavailable or customers specifically requested it. \u201cThere is no commercial relationship between Prestwick and Turnberry,\u201d he said.", "description": "Documents from the Pentagon show that \"far more taxpayer funds\" were spent by the U.S. military on overnight stays at a Trump resort in Scotland than previously known, two Democratic lawmakers said on Wednesday, as they demanded more evidence from the Defence Department as part of their investigation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431361160&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1VU", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
