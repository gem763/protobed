(AP) - Anthony Lynn knows the Los Angeles Chargers can overcome adversity, specifically the sluggish September starts that have become all too familiar.\n\nProsperity is what worries the third-year coach, and his fears proved well founded as the Chargers wasted a double-digit lead in a 27-20 loss to the Houston Texans on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe have to find a way to finish,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cHell, when we\u2019re up by 10, I\u2019m most nervous. When we\u2019re down, I\u2019m OK because I know what these men are going to do. But we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to finish, and that could be playcalling and that could be the mindset of our players.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers (1-2) find themselves with a losing record after three games for the fifth consecutive season. What makes this particular swoon galling is the costly self-inflected errors that have littered the losses at Detroit and against Houston.\n\nLeft guard Dan Feeney had a holding penalty that erased a touchdown run by Justin Jackson in the second quarter, forcing Los Angeles to settle for a field goal and 10-0 lead. It was the third touchdown wiped out by a penalty in the past two games.\n\nThe defense wasn\u2019t immune, as safety Rayshawn Jenkins\u2019 easy interception of a desperation heave by Deshaun Watson in the third quarter was negated by a face mask penalty against Desmond King II. Watson found Jordan Akins for a 53-yard catch and run touchdown four plays later, and that score would prove to be the difference in the loss.\n\nAnd when quarterback Philip Rivers had the Chargers driving for a potential tying touchdown in the final minute, completing a pass to Mike Williams at the Texans 7 with 24 seconds remaining, left tackle Trent Scott was flagged for holding. Rivers had his final two pass attempts fall incomplete.\n\n\u201cI will say we just have to be aware, you know, when we get in those situations,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cWe do a pretty good job for most of the game. It\u2019s just those one or two plays, one or two plays that always finds us.\u201d\n\nThe normally even-tempered Lynn couldn\u2019t help but let his frustration show after the game, with a few harsh words - at least by his standards - and the tone of his voice reflecting his anger and disappointment.\n\nStill, he knows the Chargers have the mindset to overcome adversity, much as they did last season where the same 1-2 start was offset by an 11-2 finish. But Lynn\u2019s enthusiasm for putting that resolve into action is tempered by the slew of injuries piling up at key positions.\n\n\u201cI do have an idea how I think this team is going to respond at 1-2, but right now I can\u2019t say we\u2019re going to do what we did last year,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cThat\u2019s a different team.\u201d\n\nLynn\u2019s current group is noticeably decimated at defensive back, where safeties Derwin James and Adrian Phillips and cornerback Trevor Williams are all on injured reserve. Their absence was felt as Watson threw for 351 yards passing and three touchdowns, with 199 yards and two of his scoring throws coming in the second half.\n\nMuch of Watson\u2019s success came when plays broke down, which, much like the inopportune penalties, linebacker Thomas Davis Sr. blamed on the Chargers\u2019 lack of discipline.\n\n\u201cReally good disciplined fundamental teams don\u2019t make the mistakes that we\u2019re making right now,\u201d Davis said. \u201cFortunate enough for us, it\u2019s still early in the season. We still have a chance to right those wrongs. That\u2019s something we have to do and we have to do it quickly.\u201d\n\nSaid Jenkins: \u201cWe could very well be 3-0 right now. It\u2019s not like these teams are just coming in here and doing whatever to us. We\u2019re beating ourselves at the end of the game.\n\n\u201cJust figure out some way, somehow to just take that part out of our game and we\u2019re good.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Anthony Lynn knows the Los Angeles Chargers can overcome adversity, specifically the sluggish September starts that have become all too familiar.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Greenspan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/aptopix_texans_chargers_football_73686_c0-129-3086-1928_s1770x1032.jpg?eee799b9749b8af1b390b3615879b88ab36bc9a2", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
