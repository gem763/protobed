Still wearing the red polo shirt and black pants required for work at the diner in South Philadelphia, she\u2019s arguing with her colleague Donna Klum. They carpool most days to spare Klum a two-hour commute on public transportation that involves three transfers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not O.K. for people not to tip,\u201d Munce says from the driver\u2019s seat, the Philly skyline passing by. Klum believes that bad karma will catch up with non-tippers, but Munce, a single mother who relies on tips to live, doesn\u2019t care much about their fate. \u201cI have to make sure that my daughter has a roof over her head,\u201d she says. The desire for cash over karma is understandable: Munce\u2019s base pay is $2.83 an hour.\n\nPhotograph by Sasha Arutyunova for TIME\n\nThe decade-long economic expansion has been a boon to those at the top of the economic ladder. But it left millions of workers behind, particularly the 4.4 million workers who rely on tips to earn a living, fully two-thirds of them women. Even as wages have crept up\u2013if slowly\u2013in other sectors of the economy, the minimum wage for waitresses and other tipped workers hasn\u2019t budged since 1991. Indeed, there is an entirely separate federal minimum wage for those who live on tips. It varies by state from as low as $2.13 (the federal tipped minimum wage) in 17 states including Texas, Nebraska and Virginia, up to $9.35 in Hawaii. In 36 states, the tipped minimum wage is under $5 an hour. Legally, employers are supposed to make up the difference when tips don\u2019t get servers to the minimum wage, but some restaurants don\u2019t track this closely and the law is rarely enforced.\n\nWaitresses are emblematic of the type of job expected to grow most in the American economy in the next decade--low-wage service work with no guaranteed hours or income. Though high-paying service jobs have been growing quickly in recent months, middle-wage jobs are growing more slowly and could decline sharply in the event of a recession, says Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody\u2019s Analytics. Those who lose their jobs in a recession usually move down, not up, the pay scale. Jobs like personal-care aide (median annual wage $24,020), food-prep worker ($21,250) and waitstaff ($21,780) are among the fastest-growing occupations in America, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). They have much in common with the burgeoning gig economy, in which people turn to apps in the hope of getting shifts delivering food, driving passengers and cleaning houses.\n\nSasha Arutyunova for TIME\n\nThis \u201csometimes\u201d work has put the stress of earning a weekly wage, paying for health insurance and saving for retirement squarely on the shoulders of workers. Munce is on food stamps and Medicaid, and many days doesn\u2019t make it to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. One of her recent paychecks read $58.67 for 49 hours worked. Add in the $245 she took home in tips, and she made about $6.20 an hour. She wants to work 40-hour weeks, but some days the diner is slow and she gets sent home early. \u201cI don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t smoke, all I do is save money,\u201d Munce says.\n\nBut these employers are hiring, and these jobs are becoming a fallback for people whose former jobs placed them solidly in the middle class. Food-service jobs have grown nearly 50% over the past two decades, to 12.2 million, according to the BLS. They are on track to surpass America\u2019s manufacturing workforce, which, at 12.8 million, has fallen 25% over the same period.\n\nSasha Arutyunova for TIME\n\nMarkets have swung wildly in recent weeks on fears of a possible recession, which could speed up the nation\u2019s continuing shift from one that makes things to one that serves things. The last recession, from 2007 to 2009, took a sharp toll on industries that make things in America, with construction and manufacturing each losing 1.9 million jobs in the five years after the recession began. In contrast, industries like health care and food service added hundreds of thousands of jobs in the same period.\n\nIf another recession starts, \u201cthe primary hit is going to generally be in sectors that don\u2019t involve providing basic services to other people,\u201d says Jacob Vigdor, an economist at the University of Washington. On Aug. 20, President Trump, while declaring the economy still strong, said the Administration is examining various options to bolster the economy. Still, whenever the next recession comes, more workers will have to turn to the booming service industry, where low wages and unstable hours are the norm.\n\nChristina Munce didn\u2019t plan to be a waitress. She was in school studying massage therapy when, at 21, she got pregnant, and started waiting tables to put away the cash she would need as a young mother. She doesn\u2019t regret a thing\u2013her daughter, now 11, is her whole world, her name tattooed in cursive on Munce\u2019s forearm. Pictures of the two posing together dominate the otherwise blank walls of their government-subsidized two-bedroom apartment. But being a single parent has limited Munce\u2019s job options, since she needs the flexibility to take care of her daughter.\n\nTipped workers have always been an underclass in America. The concept was popularized in 1865, when some formerly enslaved people found employment as waiters, barbers and porters; still seen as a servant class, they were hired to serve. Many employers refused to pay them, instead suggesting that patrons tip for their service. A 1966 law tried to bring some measure of security to these jobs, requiring employers to pay a small base wage that would bring tipped workers up to the federal minimum wage when combined with their tips. In 1991, the tipped minimum wage was equal to 50% of the value of the overall minimum wage, but it\u2019s stayed at $2.13 since then, as the minimum wage has nearly doubled. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed legislation that froze the wage for tipped workers at that amount. It hasn\u2019t changed since.\n\nThe regular minimum wage has doubled in that time. If the tipped minimum wage had even risen with inflation since 1991, it would be $6 an hour, according to research from Sylvia Allegretto, co-chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley. Only 12 states currently pay waitstaff above that.\n\nThe serving workforce remains a microcosm of pay disparities in the broader economy. According to 2011\u20132013 data from the Economic Policy Institute, people of color make up nearly 40% of the workforce that falls under federal tipped-minimum-wage rules, which includes nail-salon workers and car-wash attendants. The flexibility of restaurant work is in part why more than a million single mothers are on the job. After eight years working at the 24-hour diner, Munce, 32, mostly gets the shifts that she wants\u2013working breakfast and lunch and leaving by 3 p.m. when her daughter gets out of school\u2013so for that, she\u2019s grateful. When her daughter got bullied at school and Munce had to pick her up, Munce was able to get other waitresses to cover for her without getting in trouble for calling off work\u2013though of course this also meant she didn\u2019t get paid. When her daughter was younger and Munce couldn\u2019t find anyone to watch her, she\u2019d bring her daughter to the diner and have her sit quietly in a booth with crayons.\n\nHalf a century ago, people like Munce without a college education could expect to make a middle-class wage. But in recent years, as male-dominated manufacturing jobs have been outsourced or automated, women are contributing more to their families\u2019 paychecks, and more of the 40% of Americans with no more than a high school education are being pushed into the service sector\u2013as waitresses, domestic workers, hairdressers and Uber drivers.\n\nConsumer spending on restaurants surpassed spending in grocery stores for the first time in 2015, and to support that, the BLS projects more than 500,000 food-serving job vacancies between 2016 and 2026, a higher number of openings than in all but three occupations it tracks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a sliver of the economy,\u201d says Saru Jayaraman, co-founder of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, an advocacy organization pushing to eliminate the tipped minimum wage. \u201cWe\u2019re increasingly the jobs that are available to every new entrant into the economy, including people being laid off from other sectors.\u201d\n\nKaren Baker, 52, one of Munce\u2019s managers at Broad Street Diner, says she once made $90,000 a year as an assistant production manager in a plant that made plastic soda bottles. When the plant moved to Iowa, she didn\u2019t want to uproot her family so she returned to the service industry. \u201cThat\u2019s one good thing\u2013if you can\u2019t find a job anywhere else, you can always find a job waitressing,\u201d she says.\n\nThis is true of many service jobs, says David Autor, an economist at MIT who studies the future of work. But as job seekers are flooding into those fields, they\u2019re being met with low pay, few benefits and no raises as they age and gain more expertise. In 1980, 43% of workers without a college education were in middle-skill jobs; by 2016, that number had dropped to 29%, Autor says.\n\nSasha Arutyunova for TIME\n\nA raise for tipped workers, then, could mean a raise for middle-class families across the country, says Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute who worked in the Department of Labor under President Obama. In the seven states where servers are paid the regular minimum wage for those states before tips, including Minnesota and Oregon, the poverty rate for waitstaff and bartenders is 11.1%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Where there\u2019s a separate tipped wage, the poverty rate among waitstaff is 18.5%.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania\u2019s $2.83-an-hour tipped minimum wage, Baker\u2019s colleague Debbie Aladean, 74, says she can\u2019t retire because she has so little Social Security. Olivia Austin, a 30-year-old waitress in rural Pennsylvania, started driving across the border to a restaurant in New York, where there was a higher minimum wage, because she couldn\u2019t save any money as a waitress in Pennsylvania. \u201cMost of the people I worked with could barely pay their rent,\u201d she says.\n\nOf course, some do quite well in the restaurant industry\u2013especially white men, who are more frequently employed by fine-dining establishments. According to the National Restaurant Association (NRA), a lobbying group that represents more than 500,000 restaurant businesses, the median hourly earnings of servers, including tips, actually ranges from $19 to $25 an hour. Asking owners to do away with tipping and pay workers a $15-an-hour set wage puts too much burden on business owners and could sink one of the economy\u2019s strongest-growing sectors, they say.\n\n\u201cWe need a commonsense approach to the minimum wage that reflects the economic realities of each region, because $15 in New York is not $15 in Alabama,\u201d says Sean Kennedy, the executive vice president of public affairs for the NRA.\n\nThe owner of Broad Street Diner, Michael Petrogiannis, is supportive of raising wages. \u201cIf [the minimum wage] goes to $15 an hour, then we\u2019ll go to $15 an hour, no problem. I support that,\u201d he says. He leaves reporting tips up to the waitstaff, and his employees have not complained about being shorted. \u201cWe want them to make whatever they have to make.\u201d\n\nSasha Arutyunova for TIME\n\nThe strength of the service sector offers a sort of tenuous job security for waitresses, but it comes with few protections. Sexual harassment is rampant. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission receives more complaints of sexual harassment from the restaurant industry\u2013more than 10,000 from 1995 to 2016\u2013than from any other industry. Many waitresses have come to expect it. On a shift in July, Munce chirped back at offhanded sexual comments as readily as she dished out nicknames to regulars. When a man called her \u201cthick and delicious\u201d on his way out the door, she replied, \u201cI think you mean tiny and tasty,\u201d without skipping a beat.\n\nAfter 12 years of waitressing, Munce\u2019s somewhat hardened to the disrespect, but for her, the fickleness of the work is a bigger problem when it affects her family\u2019s well-being. Her daily income depends on whether people decide to brave the heat or snow to dine out the day she\u2019s working. It depends on whether customers order the $5.29 breakfast special or the $16.99 New York sirloin strip with two eggs, and whether they leave 20% of their bill. It depends on how many other waitresses are working that day, all hungry for tables.\n\nThis lack of certainty is stressful for waitresses, but as more workers face this reality, it has implications for the broader American economy, which relies on consumer spending to drive growth. Munce has saved about $1,000 by putting aside every $5 bill she earns in tips, but she can\u2019t seem to ever get ahead. During a recent shift, she was staring down a weekend where she\u2019d need cash for a cake for her daughter\u2019s 11th-birthday party, $650 for a new evaporator for her car and quarters for the laundry. She feels the weight of taking a day without tips, wondering whether she\u2019ll have enough to pay for back-to-school season, or the money that finally allowed her to get an air conditioner for her apartment. \u201cMy mind is always calculating,\u201d she says of each tip, good or bad. Though the women at the diner will chip in and pay for one another\u2019s expenses in case of emergency\u2013a car accident, a babysitter or even funeral costs\u2013slow shifts mean they\u2019ll have to lean more on the one free meal they get at work, or make another trip to the food bank, or dip into whatever cash they have stored away from a better week.\n\nBecause their pay is so unpredictable, the women at Broad Street Diner sometimes have to pull double or triple shifts when they\u2019re short on cash. The day before Munce drove Klum home, Klum had worked her regular day shift, taken her 5-year-old daughter to a public splash park, and then gotten a call from her manager at 11 p.m. to come in for a night shift three hours later. Klum paid for a Lyft to the diner, since public transportation doesn\u2019t run to her apartment after midnight, then worked a double shift, from 2 a.m. to 3 p.m. \u201cThe diner\u2019s been slow, so I really needed it,\u201d Klum says. But as bad as the money can be, it\u2019s helpful to be able to go home with cash in hand. She still holds out for the chance of one big payday, obsessing over YouTube videos where women are left a $12,000 tip. But when Munce suggests that they would be better off getting a fair hourly wage rather than depending on tips, Klum balks. \u201cI would never do this without tips,\u201d she says.\n\nRestaurant owners say that the problem isn\u2019t low wages, or even low tips\u2013it\u2019s that the federal government should enforce its requirement that waitresses make at least the minimum wage after tips. But the sheer number of restaurants in America\u2013an estimated 650,000 and growing\u2013makes that difficult.\n\n\u201cWe could have spent all of our time on tipped-minimum-wage enforcement because the violations are so pervasive,\u201d says David Weil, who was the head of the Wage and Hour Division in the Department of Labor under President Obama. Weil\u2019s division did 5,000 investigations into the restaurant sector in his time in the department, but \u201cwe were just scratching the surface,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Trump Administration last year revoked an Obama-era rule that would have increased enforcement on restaurants that make tipped employees spend more than 20% of their time on non-tipped work.\n\nThe federal government does help low-wage workers like waitresses in other ways\u2013with food stamps, subsidized housing and health care. Some cities have raised their own tipped minimum wages; others have opened wage-and-hour enforcement offices, but investigations on behalf of tipped workers often remain a low priority. In Philadelphia, a branch of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Labor looks into complaints of wage theft. But the city\u2019s messaging suggests it devotes more staff and resources to its long-standing offices guaranteeing fair pay for construction and government workers; its department that enforces wage-theft complaints was formed in 2015 and has only four employees. The chief of staff of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Labor, Manny Citron, who is responsible for enforcement, says that although he was \u201cnot a pro on what our labor law says,\u201d he believed that people who didn\u2019t earn $7.25 an hour with tips \u201ccould just be a bad waiter,\u201d and he falsely asserted that state law guarantees only $2.83 an hour. Without any documentation showing that cash tips didn\u2019t bring waitresses to the minimum wage, he says, it\u2019s hard for his office to take any action.\n\nIn July, the House passed the Raise the Wage Act, which would phase out the tipped minimum wage nationwide by 2027, eventually bringing all low-wage workers to $15 an hour. \u201cEvery member of this institution should be fighting to put more money in the pockets of workers in their communities,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor when the bill was passed. In 2019 alone, at least 12 states as politically varied as Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Indiana introduced legislation to end the tipped minimum wage.\n\nBut the Raise the Wage Act has little chance of advancing in the GOP-controlled Senate. It has vocal opponents in the NRA and the Restaurant Workers of America (RWA), a group of servers who want to keep tipping. \u201cIt\u2019s a system that works,\u201d says Joshua Chaisson, a Maine waiter who is a co-founder of the RWA.\n\nRestaurant owners say they aren\u2019t the ones who should pay the price of America\u2019s shift to a service economy. \u201cToday, the middle class has been gutted, but [lawmakers] are trying to legislate entry-level low-skilled jobs into living-wage jobs where you can raise a family in New York, one of the most expensive places in the world,\u201d says Andrew Riggie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, which represents hotels and restaurants. \u201cWe can\u2019t address all societal ills on the shoulders of small-business owners.\u201d\n\nSasha Arutyunova for TIME\n\nIn the long, final days of summer, business at Broad Street Diner has been slow. Munce tries to stay positive. The customers and staff of Broad Street Diner are her family, more or less, and not just because her sister, Jeanne, is also a waitress there. Munce speaks fondly of one of her regulars, Bill, an elderly man who likes his toast dark as a hockey puck. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the best girls in here, and I\u2019ll tell ya, not one grouch,\u201d Bill says to no audience in particular one day this summer.\n\nFor Munce, it all adds up: the freebies, the walkouts, the cops receiving a 50% discount, the mess-ups from the kitchen\u2013each one a knock to her take-home pay. \u201cI am a people person. But at the end of the day, your compliments and smiles are not enough,\u201d she says during one of her shifts, a sheen of sweat on her forehead.\n\nShe hopes she can give her daughter a better life than she had growing up. Her dad served in Vietnam and her mom always scraped by on odd jobs, she says, but it\u2019s harder to string together a living these days. She lives a couple of miles from where she grew up. Is she really doing better than they did? She tells her daughter that education is the most important thing, that she needs to get good grades, no matter what. \u201cI say, \u2018I just want you to be better than me,'\u201d she says. Not that she\u2019d steer her daughter away from waitressing, necessarily. If you\u2019re a people person, Munce says, it can be fun to talk to strangers all day. Depending on them for tips, though, is something else.", "description": "", "authors": ["Alana Semuels", "Malcolm Burnley"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/tim190902v1_waitress.cover6_.jpg?quality=85&w=1012"}
