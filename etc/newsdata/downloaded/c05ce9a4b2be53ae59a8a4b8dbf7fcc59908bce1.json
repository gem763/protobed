Potential candidates fear the job. Were I Oprah, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t run for president. Ditto pretty much every other celebrity whose name is floated for the job. As Trump himself is fond of pointing out, he \u201ccould be having a very nice life right now\u201d instead of being \u201cwith you people, ranting and raving.\u201d This is equally true of other celebrities. Being president cannot be pleasant, and it is more than understandable that celebrities would not seriously seek the Oval Office, even if they occasionally toy with the idea in long magazine profiles to affect an air of public spiritedness.\n\n5. Potential candidates fear the race. Running against Trump ensures a brutal slog of a campaign. He\u2019ll marshal venomous chants at his campaign rallies. He\u2019ll trot out petty nicknames. If his rival is a woman, he\u2019ll make sexist cracks about her appearance. If it\u2019s a man, he\u2019ll impugn his masculinity. If it\u2019s anyone less white than Biden \u2014 well, you know how ugly Trump\u2019s rhetoric will be. It\u2019s easy to see why anyone, celebrity or not, would want to skip this race.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bonnie Kristian", "Theweek.Com Articles Why-Arent-More-Celebrities-Running-President"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
