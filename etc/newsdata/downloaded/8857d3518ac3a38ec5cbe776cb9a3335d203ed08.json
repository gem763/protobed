REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett\n\n\u201cAir pollution is currently the most important environmental risk to human health,\u201d the European Environment Agency (EEA), the EU\u2019s health agency, said in the report.\n\nThe report\u2019s author, EEA air quality expert Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez Ortiz, said that while the level of dangerous particles in European cities was dropping, it was not dropping fast enough.\n\n\u201cWe have not yet reached the EU standards and of course we are far from reaching the WHO (World Health Organization) standards,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nEU law currently requires countries to assess the level, notably in urban areas, of a range of pollutants, including ozone and particulate matter, and take action if certain limits are hit.\n\nParticle pollution in cities has become the target of tougher restrictions after the EU\u2019s top court ruled in June that cities needed to act if pollution levels were exceeded in a single black spot rather than based on an average across a region.\n\nIn July, the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive body, asked the EU\u2019s Court of Justice to take action against Spain and Bulgaria over their poor air quality, warning the countries were failing to protect citizens against pollution.\n\nEU limits are set per pollutant and in 2017, 16 out of the EU\u2019s 28 member states reported at least one case of levels of nitrogen dioxide, a poisonous gas in car exhaust, being higher than the legal EU annual mean concentration. This list includes France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Britain.\n\nSome stations in London, for example, reported levels of more than 50 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic meter of air, compared with the legal EU annual mean concentration of 40 micrograms.\n\nOn Tuesday, the British government proposed a new environment bill that includes legally binding targets to reduce fine particles in the air and forcing vehicle manufacturers to recall cars that do not meet particle emission standards.\n\nReducing the number of cars is an important factor in reducing air pollution in cities, especially of nitrogen dioxide, Ortiz said.\n\n\u201cWhen we fight pollution, we also fight climate change as well as noise and promote more healthy behavior. It\u2019s a win-win,\u201d he added.", "description": "Poor air quality caused about 400,000 premature deaths in Europe in 2016, the most recent year data is available, and almost every city-dwelling European is exposed to pollution levels that exceed healthy levels, according to a report on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Jonas Ekblom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441410386&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0M3", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
