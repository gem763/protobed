Please consider supporting our independent journalism\n\nThe first dusting of snow covered the plum pudding summit of Mount Fuji this week, some 22 days later than it normally arrives. It is almost as if the Japanese climate is reflecting the changing pattern of a tournament where keeping cool heads is increasingly vital. For anyone wishing to win the 2019 Rugby World Cup, the time to start peaking is now.\n\nManu Tuilagi: \u2018It\u2019s an honour to face the haka and accept the challenge\u2019 Read more\n\nSteve Hansen, who knows a little about winning World Cups, sees this week as the tournament\u2019s pivotal period. Even top sides, he believes, can be at their most vulnerable when they have just won well and cruised into the last four. \u201cSometimes people come off the euphoria of the quarter-final and start looking ahead at the final,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cWhen you start looking beyond where you\u2019re actually at, your mind\u2019s not where your feet are and you\u2019re vulnerable.\u201d\n\nWhich is among the reasons why New Zealand and England have both re-set themselves selectorially this week. Showing the opposition a different picture and picking the right gameplan are both crucial but so is removing any sense of inevitable victory. Eddie Jones used a boxing analogy, perhaps to reinforce the need for total vigilance. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great contest, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said the head coach, who has been awaiting this semi-final bout for years. \u201cTwo heavyweights, one dressed in black, one dressed in white. You couldn\u2019t think of a better scenario.\u201d\n\nThe respective trainers are certainly earning their corn. While the redeployment of Scott Barrett in the All Blacks back row and George Ford\u2019s return at fly-half for England may appear straightforward tactical calls, designed to help influence the lineout and kicking duels respectively, there are other considerations at work.\n\nBarrett, unsurprisingly given the household from which he hails, also has a fine pair of hands and is comfortable playing an offloading game. New Zealand, in other words, have an extra piano shifter but still possess the ability to make England dance to their all-court tune.\n\nIn Ford\u2019s case, England are also recalling an in-form player with excellent spatial awareness who can help counter the All Blacks\u2019 deft kicking game. Jones believes work-rate off the ball is even more important against New Zealand and will hope the Leicester No 10 can help to defuse the footballing threat posed by Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett.\n\nFord is also a useful man to have on your side if you potentially require 25 points or more to win a World Cup semi-final. It may sound self-evident but to beat the All Blacks with multiple attacking threats you need to be able, at some stage, to create something yourself.\n\nThe bench also appears to have been carefully chosen. If it is close heading into the last quarter, as is more than likely, England have opted to finish with technically excellent, tough forwards in George Kruis, Joe Marler and Mark Wilson who will never, ever give up. Jones, from vast experience, knows only a concerted 80-minute effort will do. \u201cOne thing about playing New Zealand is that you have to be alive all the time. They are always in the game, always looking for opportunities. Our players are equipped for that and ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThere is just one snag: New Zealand have rarely sounded as switched on before a big game as they have this week. Behind Hansen\u2019s dust-dry, laconic exterior lurks a seriously smart operator and his eight years as All Blacks head coach have also taught him how to amuse a room full of journalists keen to hear what he thought of Jones\u2019s mischievous pre-match comments on Tuesday. Not only did Hansen smash the spy-in-the-flats nonsense to all parts \u2013 \u201cthe best clickbait in the world\u201d but he also delivered a few stealthy wicket-taking balls of his own, particularly on the issue of pressure and how England, despite Jones\u2019s clever deflections, may or may not cope with it.\n\nTake the following, for example: \u201cWe know we\u2019re under pressure, we don\u2019t need Eddie to tell us that. What he needs to work out is this: what are England going to do about the pressure they\u2019re under? To say they\u2019ve got nothing to lose \u2026 Eddie doesn\u2019t believe that either.\u201d Along with his team, Hansen has the ability to turn defence into instant attack, complete with a wry punchline or two. Had Jones, someone asked, put a smiley emoji on the end of the text message he sent Hansen this week? \u201cHe\u2019s not a smiley face man,\u201d replied Hansen, deadpan.\n\nThe All Blacks captain, Kieran Read, was also impressive, making clear his players \u201ccannot just roll into\u201d this weekend after pulverising Ireland. The hooker, Codie Taylor, will be winning his 50th cap \u2013 as will England\u2019s Billy Vunipola \u2013 but Hansen believes there is a bigger picture involved beyond result-driven imperatives and personal milestones. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the game can live up to the hype because, if it does, we will be sending a message around the world \u2013 \u2018wow, what a wonderful game\u2019 \u2013 to rugby lovers and people seeing it for the first time. There\u2019s an important side-outcome about who will win it but, ultimately, it won\u2019t define the All Blacks and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t define England either.\u201d\n\nHe is right in theory: there is far more to life than a game of rugby. For every player awaiting Saturday\u2019s title eliminator, however, it does not currently feel that way.", "description": "Eddie Jones and Steve Hansen bulk up their sides as they prepare for the battle of the heavyweights", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/642a6149e2ff08015966a5bb6c17abacdafe8148/0_27_5195_3117/master/5195.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a6487f668f145e165dacc0e356e42969", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
