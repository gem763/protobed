[PARK SANG-MOON]\n\nThe familiar mournful tone of \u201cArirang, Arirang, Arariyo\u201d that saddens many listeners\u2019 hearts is not all there is to the famous Korean traditional folk song \u201cArirang.\u201d The annual Seoul Arirang Festival, which kicks off its seventh edition today at the Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul, aims to celebrate the song and allow listeners to enjoy it without any boundaries.\u201cI\u2019ve studied Arirang for many years,\u201d said Kim Duk-soo, Korea\u2019s renowned traditional percussionist and a virtuoso of the janggu (hourglass-shaped drum). \u201cArirang is the song that is in Koreans\u2019 DNA because of its three-beat rhythm known as saemachi. It\u2019s very folksy, religious and directly connected to hydrography. This triple time can go faster or slower. It doesn\u2019t matter as the basis is the three beats, which is linked to the sky, the earth and humans.\u201dBut merely explaining that the song is ours and that we should treasure it because it is officially recognized on Unesco\u2019s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, is not enough to persuade the younger generation and the general public to feel closer to Arirang.That is why Kim, who is spearheading the opening concert of the Seoul Arirang Festival, decided to establish a project band Arirang Super Band. The band is composed of Kim\u2019s samulnori ensemble, which includes a percussion quartet featuring four percussion instruments: buk (barrel drum), janggu, a jing (gong) and a kkwaenggwari (small gong). The group is composed of pansori master Ahn Sook-sun, as well as western musical instrument players including jazz trumpeter Lee Ju-han, violinist Huh Hee-jeong and keyboardist Nam Meari.Kim also included young Korean hip-hop dancers in the group and decided to invite two artists from abroad who he has been collaborating with for more than 30 years to produce the music based on nongak, or traditional farmer\u2019s music.\u201cNot only to show how Arirang can be cross-generational, but also cross-national, I wanted to invite my two dear friends and renowned artists, saxophonist Wolfgang Puschnig, who came from Austria and bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma who came from America.\u201d\u201cIt can definitely be cross-national,\u201d said Tacuma, who was rehearsing for the opening concert with the band members at a rehearsal studio in Samseong-dong, southern Seoul on Wednesday. \u201cEven if a person does not know what \u2018Arirang\u2019 means, they\u2019ll feel something when they hear it. \u2018Arirang,\u2019 I think is one of those powerful songs that doesn\u2019t have to be explained. You just feel it and you just react from it. When I hear \u2018Arirang,\u2019 it gives me this feeling of warmth. It\u2019s very organic and natural at the same time. It\u2019s not music that is superficial. It\u2019s very pure and spiritual.\u201dAs for Puschnig, \u201ccomfort\u201d is the word that comes into his mind every time he listens to \u201cArirang.\u201d \u201cI think it touches the same thing inside everybody. There\u2019s so many different ways and so many different expressions of \u2018Arirang,\u2019 but in the end, it all goes to the same spot,\u201d he added.The trio\u2019s first encounter goes back to 1987 in Vienna at an international festival for percussion instruments. Although it was through Kim the two foreign artists ever heard \u201cArirang,\u201d and gugak (traditional Korean music) for the first time, the three, along with other Korean and western musicians got together to form a project group called Redsun-Sumulnori and produced what is now called world music.\u201cBack then in 1988, words like world music and multi-culture, cross-genre were starting to get used,\u201d said Kim, \u201cand many of these words were used to refer to the music we created.\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for more than 30 years,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI am a traditional musician and for the past 30 years, I\u2019ve been working with new sounds, working with people in different age groups and from diverse genres, trying to mix different sounds and continuously making attempts to create something new from our tradition to the extent where we don\u2019t distort it.\u201dThat\u2019s what audience members will see during the opening concert of this year\u2019s Seoul Arirang Festival.\u201cWe got together yesterday as well for the rehearsal of the opening concert and it was interesting to see how the hip-hop dancers dancing to the rhythm of the traditional percussions reminded me of the samulnori performances and the traditional dances,\u201d said Tacuma.\u201cThis performance we do is so cross-generational and there was just no barrier. No barrier in color, no barrier in age and no barrier in genre. I loved it.\u201dThe history of Redsun-Samulnori goes back \u201ctoo long,\u201d and since they are now \u201call aged over 60,\u201d they can\u2019t remember how many different countries they toured together, how many albums they released, or how many different versions of Arirang they have played, but their next hope is to perform \u201cArirang\u201d together in North Korea.\u201cHow we met and got together and came this far is all so coincidental,\u201d recalled Kim. \u201cI think we are a great role model for younger musicians, and since we are getting old, I hope to foster more international project groups like us and go cross borders and embrace and enjoy each other\u2019s cultures.\u201d\u201cI think Europeans, Americans and Asians - all of them were quite shocked to see us, a group of musicians with different skin colors playing western instruments and traditional Korean instruments in our own style back in 1980s and 90s and they are still quite impressed now,\u201d Kim added. \u201cWe were and still are sensational and we hope to celebrate and enjoy folk music this way.\u201dBY YIM SEUNG-HYE [sharon@joongang.co.kr]Seoul Arirang Festival kicks off today for three days in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul.
