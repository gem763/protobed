Though the games borrow heavily from the comics, Rocksteady's Arkham universe is a gritty, R-Rated interpretation of the Batman mythos with an emphasis on mystery and cinematic storytelling.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"LEGO Batman\" games are designed to be accessible for all ages and can be played with two players at all times. The \"LEGO Batman\" series was popular enough to spawn a feature length film and a cartoon series of its own.\n\nVisit the Epic Games Store now to claim your copies of these amazing games and pay homage to the Dark Knight.", "description": "It's Batman's 80th anniversary and the Epic Games Store is celebrating by giving away a pack of the top Batman games for free on PC.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d89395b2e22af3433526964-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
