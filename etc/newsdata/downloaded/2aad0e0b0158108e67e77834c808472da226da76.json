One asked her if the company did business in Iran, he said.\n\n\"I reminded the subject that she was the CFO of a multibillion-dollar company,\" Peck quoted the agent as saying.\n\n\"Those questions relate directly to the allegations that found the warrant and [these] extradition proceedings,\" Peck said. He added rhetorically: \"What [do] these questions have to do with a routine immigration investigation?\"\n\nPeck said Tuesday that Meng's treatment by CBSA officers was \"anything but routine\".\n\nAnother of her lawyers, Scott Fenton, said Meng had suffered \"serious violations\" of her Canadian charter rights. He argued that it was within Justice Heather Holmes' powers to stay proceedings on the basis of such abuses.\n\nFenton referred to the seizure of Meng's electronic devices by CBSA officers before her arrest as an abuse of process. Crown lawyers now claimed US authorities were no longer interested in the contents of the devices, he said, but \"that does not lessen the severity of the abuse\".\n\nFenton said the CBSA search of Meng was conducted under the \"plausible facade\" of an immigration examination, but it had an \"unlawful aim\".\n\n\"In reality ... they were exercising their powers for an improper purpose,\" Fenton said, namely, gathering evidence for the FBI's criminal investigation of Meng.\n\nFenton said there were \"strategic omissions\" from the CBSA record to obscure this.\n\n\"We are not on the proverbial 'fishing expedition' in any way,\" he said. \"We are not relying on conjecture or guesswork or wishful thinking.\"\n\nMeng entered court in a short black cocktail dress, encrusted in sequins on the sleeves and collar, and wearing black velvet stilettos, also twinkling with sequins. It was a second eye-catching outfit for Meng this week, and a departure from her earlier courtroom attire. She had previously favoured hooded sweatshirts and other casual clothing in court.\n\nShe was arrested at the Vancouver airport during a stopover from Hong Kong on her way to Mexico.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Lawyers for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on Tuesday played a silent video in court of her being questioned by Canadian border officers at Vancouver's airport on December 1, claiming they show her being asked about the Chinese tech giant's business dealings in Iran.The video was used to bolster", "authors": ["Ian Young In Vancouver"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PfgVOI6Sh.S0FyaOJfbh2A--~B/aD03NzA7dz0xMzIwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_us_228/5a9bcff5653f88e5b6c8805654194e18", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
