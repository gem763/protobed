The Macallan 1979 Gran Reserva, for example, was truly a stunning dram. There are other bottles from other distillers that are at least as good.\"\n\nFacts about cask number 263\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe Spanish oak sherry cask was distilled in 1926 and bottled in 1986.\n\nOnly 40 bottles were produced.\n\nMacallan commissioned pop artists Peter Blake and Valerio Adami to design labels for a limited edition of 24 bottles - 12 Adami and 12 Blake.\n\nOne bottle was hand-painted by Irish artist Michael Dillon.\n\nThe rest of the bottles form part of The Macallan Fine and Rare Collection, which includes the Macallan 1926.\n\nExperts believe at least one of the bottles has been consumed.\n\nThe new owner of the Macallan 1926, who has not been identified, may never get round to tasting this particular bottle.\n\nRW101 co-director Andy Simpson says purchasers of rare whisky fall into three categories - the drinker, the investor and the collector.\n\nImage copyright Sotheby's Image caption The 60-year-old Macallan sold for a record \u00a31.45m at auction\n\nMr Simpson thinks it unlikely that the bottle was bought to be consumed, given its value.\n\nNor does he think an investor is behind the purchase.\n\nHe explains: \"The investor is looking to leverage value in a bottle by buying low and selling high, which is clearly not the case here.\n\n\"In my opinion - and I could be wrong - this bottle was bought by a collector who simply didn't care about the price because they needed it to complete a collection.\"", "description": "One of the few people to have tasted a single malt that sold for a record \u00a31.5m gives his verdict.", "authors": ["Magnus Bennett", "Bbc Scotland News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2572/production/_109368590_mediaitem109368587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
