(AP) - Back in May, Seahawks left tackle Duane Brown said he believed Seattle\u2019s offensive line had a chance to be the best in the NFL.\n\nWhile Seattle is off to a 2-0 start, that prediction hasn\u2019t played out over the first two weeks of the season. Russell Wilson has been sacked eight times and the unit had seven penalties called against it in Sunday\u2019s win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nCoach Pete Carroll said the unit needs to clean up the mistakes.\n\n\u201cI hope this hit hard enough this week,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI hope the lessons are strong enough that we can make the impression on our guys. This isn\u2019t something that we\u2019ve missed, we\u2019re just not accomplishing the objective of cleaning it up and we got to get it done.\u201d\n\nCarroll has made it no secret that he believes this group is capable of great things this year. He noted his disappointment that the group struggled in the opener against the Cincinnati Bengals and followed that up Monday with the penalties incurred against the Steelers.\n\n\u201cWhen your arms extend in blocks, it\u2019s just a red flag (to officials) and here it comes, you know,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIf they can see that you don\u2019t get it removed immediately then you get called. That\u2019s just being sloppy with our hands and we have to do better. We\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re not on it yet.\u201d\n\nAll four sacks of Wilson on Sunday came in the first half. The unit came together after halftime and kept Wilson upright along with being penalty free in the third quarter. However, there were three more penalties in the final quarter that the team managed to overcome with a touchdown drive and a drive that lasted 5:34 to run out the clock against Pittsburgh.\n\nBut that still left a false start from right tackle Germain Ifedi, six flags thrown for holding against the unit and two additional illegal blocks in the back penalties from wide receiver Jaron Brown.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s a point of emphasis for the league and we\u2019re working our asses off to have that emphasis ourselves,\u201d Ifedi said.\n\nDespite the miscues, Seattle\u2019s offense still amassed 425 yards of total offense as Wilson dissected the Pittsburgh defense when given the time to do so. Chris Carson and Rashaad Penny also carried the team to a 151-yard rushing day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll improve in the next couple of weeks just like we improved in the game. You could see the improvement from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, and hopefully we can keep doing that,\u201d Carroll said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Back in May, Seahawks left tackle Duane Brown said he believed Seattle's offensive line had a chance to be the best in the NFL.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Curtis Crabtree"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/bengals_seahawks_football_50278_c0-190-4547-2841_s1770x1032.jpg?f4c0c8741ca10f69d0ed8e40f959ff612657f6c2", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
