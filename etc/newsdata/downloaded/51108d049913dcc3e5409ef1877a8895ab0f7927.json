Diets would have to change, by drastically cutting back on meat and dairy. And there would have to be a massive increase in renewable energy, along with many other radical changes.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who are Extinction Rebellion?\n\nBut those involved with Extinction Rebellion say the future of the planet depends on it. \"We have left it so late that we have to step up in a semi-miraculous way to deal with this situation,\" said co-founder Gail Bradbrook.\n\nHowever, the group doesn't say what the solutions to tackle climate change should be. Instead, it wants the government to create a \"citizens' assembly\", made up of randomly selected people representing a cross-section of society. Its members would decide how to solve the climate crisis, with advice from experts.\n\nWhat are its tactics?\n\nIn April 2019, Extinction Rebellion held a large demonstration in London. Over the course of 11 days, some of the city's busiest routes were brought to a standstill.\n\nThe action resulted in more than 1,100 arrests - most on suspicion of not following police instructions to move.\n\nSome activists glued themselves to trains and to the entrance of the London Stock Exchange. Some marched on Heathrow Airport and others chained themselves up.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Extinction Rebellion uses an hourglass inside a circle as its logo\n\nInternationally, Extinction Rebellion estimates an additional 400 of its activists have been arrested since 31 October 2018, including about 70 in New York City.\n\nIn June, activists blocked traffic in New York, several German protesters chained themselves outside Angela Merkel's Chancellery in Berlin, and in Paris the police used pepper spray to clear activists blocking a bridge over the Seine.\n\nWhat have critics said about them?\n\nIt is not difficult to find people who object to Extinction Rebellion's tactics - from delayed drivers on Twitter to newspaper columnists.\n\nIts supporters have been criticised as \"environmental fanatics\" who plan to ruin thousands of holidays and risk alienating thousands of potential supporters.\n\nApril's London protests cost the police an extra \u00a37.5m, according to Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Activists staged peaceful protests by lying down on busy roads across the capital\n\nExtinction Rebellion says anyone angered by its protests should \"find out more about the severity of the ecological and climate crisis\".\n\nIt has also defended causing criminal damage, such as smashing windows. It says such tactics are sometimes necessary and that it is \"super careful\" not to put anyone at risk.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Roger Hallam, one of the Extinction Rebellion co-founders, spoke to the BBC in August\n\nWho supports Extinction Rebellion?\n\nYoung people are most likely to agree with its aims, a survey of 3,000 people conducted by YouGov in April suggests.\n\nAmong 18- to 24-year-olds, 47% either \"strongly supported\" or \"somewhat supported\" the disruption of traffic and public transport to highlight Extinction Rebellion's aims.\n\nExtinction Rebellion gets most support from younger adults Adults asked if they broadly support or oppose disruptive climate protests\n\nThat compared with 36% of those aged 50-65 and 28% of over-65s.\n\nIt has also received support from public figures, such as the actress Emma Thompson, politicians Diane Abbott and Caroline Lucas and the bands Radiohead and Massive Attack.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion is planning to start a two-week protest from Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B0CA/production/_107885254_gettyimages-1137340786.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
