(Jerry Jackson/Baltimore Sun)\n\nThe head of an aerial surveillance company is pitching Baltimore officials on flying not one but three camera-laden planes above the city simultaneously, covering most of the city and its violent crime, he said in emails obtained by the Baltimore Sun.\n\nA pair of Texas donors have stepped forward to help fund three planes and extra police, 40 local analysts and oversight personnel if there is city buy-in, the records and interviews show. The effort aims to \u201cdemonstrate the effectiveness\u201d of such an all-seeing surveillance system in fighting crime in the city.\n\nThe enlarged scope of the three-year, $6.6 million surveillance pitch was welcomed by supporters and denounced by detractors contacted by the Sun.\n\nRoss McNutt of Ohio-based Persistent Surveillance Systems said in emails to officials in Mayor Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young\u2019s office that most City Council members had expressed their support for the surveillance planes, though several council members denied it. No decision has been made.\n\nEach plane would be capable of recording up to 32 square miles at a time, and each would fly 45 to 50 hours a week, McNutt said.\n\n\u201cWith these three coverage areas, we would be able to cover areas that include 80 to 90 percent of the murders and shootings in Baltimore,\u201d McNutt wrote in an email last month to Sheryl Goldstein, Young\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe work would cost $2.2 million a year, said McNutt, whose company previously flew a single surveillance plane over Baltimore as part of a secret pilot program in 2016.\n\nThat funding would cover the cost of putting the planes up, additional police officers to work cases aided by the surveillance, independent oversight of the program\u2019s privacy measures and a University of Baltimore-led evaluation of the program\u2019s \u201ceffectiveness in supporting investigations and deterring crime in the community,\u201d McNutt wrote.\n\nMcNutt said the program costs would be covered by Texas philanthropists Laura and John Arnold, who also funded the 2016 pilot program. John Arnold, in a statement, confirmed his strong interest in funding the program but said nothing is certain yet.\n\n\u201cWhile we have not formally committed to additional funding, we have expressed significant interest in a proposal to restart the program if it has support from Baltimore city leaders and the broader community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will wait to see a formal proposal before making a firm commitment.\u201d\n\nLester Davis, a spokesman for Young, referred questions about the proposal to Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re allowing the commissioner to run the police department because he\u2019s a law enforcement expert,\u201d Davis said.\n\nAfter Harrison met with McNutt last month, he said McNutt and others \u201cgave an excellent presentation,\u201d but there \u201cis some work to be done\u201d and he had not made a decision on whether to pursue a collaboration again. A spokesman said that Harrison\u2019s position has not changed.\n\nSeveral members of the City Council said they did not know about McNutt\u2019s latest proposal, and took issue with his contention that \u201cmost if [not] all council members in private expressed support\u201d for the plane.\n\nCouncil President Brandon Scott, who McNutt specifically named as being a supporter, said he told McNutt before a contentious public hearing on the plane last October that he was \u201cindifferent\u201d to the technology. Since then, he said, he has seen no evidence it reduced crime when a plane secretly flew over the city in 2016.\n\nScott suggested that if donors want to provide $6.6 million toward the crime fight, they should spend it on \u201cproven\u201d tools. For instance, less than $2.5 million, he said, could buy 40 new CitiWatch cameras and 60 new license-plate readers.\n\nThe city is on track to see more than 300 homicides for the fifth year in a row.\n\nThe 2016 pilot program was halted amid criticism of its secrecy and condemnations from civil liberties advocates who say the system represents a sweeping overreach of surveillance that violates individuals\u2019 rights.\n\n[In Baltimore, the police and a private company run surveillance flights]\n\nIn an interview, McNutt said his latest proposal has support from dozens of victims, community organizations and business groups desperate for solutions. Earlier this month, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) endorsed the city\u2019s use of a surveillance plane.\n\nSupporters \u201csee it as the best thing for Baltimore, and they don\u2019t want to see Baltimore miss out on this opportunity,\u201d McNutt said. \u201cIt\u2019s personal to them.\u201d\n\nMillie Brown, a former Johns Hopkins Hospital employee who founded Tears of a Mother\u2019s Cry, an organization that supports mothers who have lost children to gun violence, said she is \u201c110 percent behind\u201d McNutt\u2019s plans, as are many of the women her organization serves.\n\n\u201cHaving the eye in the sky is a no-brainer with all of the bloodshed that we have in our city. We have someone that\u2019s offered to pay for it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere are so many murders and robberies that could have been solved if we would have had that plane up in the sky.\u201d\n\nBesides Scott, other council members said they haven\u2019t heard much about the program since the October hearing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m among those who publicly asked questions and have not gotten any answers,\u201d said Councilman Isaac \u201cYitzy\u201d Schleifer, chair of the public safety committee. \u201cIf anybody on anything wants my support, they\u2019re going to have to answer the questions I have in order for me to make an informed decision.\u201d\n\nDavid Rocah, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, has been a vocal critic of McNutt\u2019s technology in Baltimore. On Wednesday, he said the latest proposal shows that the program is intended to capture as much as possible and, once introduced, would be capable of expanding.\n\n\u201cWhat was one plane is now three, and the coverage is, instead of half the city, the entire city, and the duration of surveillance is now the entirety of the daylight hours, essentially,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is being created is the permanent surveillance of everywhere that everyone in Baltimore goes every time they walk out the door. That has always been the design and intent and this further clarifies it. And that is something that simply should never be done in a free country, period.\u201d\n\nMcNutt said he is more than happy to brief anyone on the project, and already has held dozens of community meetings. He said Rocah\u2019s concerns, echoed in the community, are based more on fear than fact. He has repeatedly stressed his efforts to protect people\u2019s privacy rights, including in emails to officials.\n\n\u201cWe have an extensive privacy protection program including limiting the resolution to 1 pixel per person so there is no identifying information on a person only a single dot,\u201d McNutt wrote in an email sent to Rikki Spector, the former City Council member who has been an outspoken proponent of a surveillance plane program. \u201cWe look only at locations of reported crimes. We are not predicting crime but only responding to them.\u201d\n\nThe proposal includes hiring more analysts who would be tapped into the city\u2019s new ShotSpotter system, McNutt said. That would allow them to put eyes on the locations of shootings faster than ever before, and then follow potential suspects from the scene and backward and forward through time.\n\nThe system also can spring into action in response to 911 calls, McNutt said.\n\n\u201cIn both cases we can \u2018rewind time\u2019 and watch the crimes occur and follow the people and vehicles from the crime scene to the houses [they] come from and go to and the routes they take,\u201d McNutt wrote in an Aug. 9 email to Goldstein.\n\nMcNutt said his technology has been used to secure confessions. In about 300 hours of flight in 2016, the pilot plane captured five homicides and 18 shootings, including two police shootings, he said.\n\nIn his email to Goldstein, McNutt described a case in which the pilot plane tracked suspects in an assault on an officer as they passed by 75 CitiWatch cameras, from which investigators obtained \u201c28 decent images\u201d of the perpetrators \u2014 the last of whom he said recently pleaded guilty in court.\n\nThe program also has been used by defense attorneys \u201cto show innocence and to challenge police statements,\u201d McNutt wrote to Spector, which he said has helped secure community support.\n\n\u2014 Baltimore Sun\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The company behind the proposal previously flew one plane over the city as part of a secret pilot program in 2016.", "authors": ["Kevin Rector", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XrgT2XLuUOw4hwM2rSPpzq0cMD8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MSIGQBG6JAI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
