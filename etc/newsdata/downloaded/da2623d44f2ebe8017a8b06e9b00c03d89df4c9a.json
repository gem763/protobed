'No question about it \u2014 we would not stay married, because of what that would have meant to him, and I would have had my own ideas about it.'\n\nThe two of us: Oprah, 65, and Stedman Graham, 65, have been together since 1986, and even got engaged in 1992 \u2014 but they never got married or had kids\n\nJust the way it is: She said that if she had to play by the 'rules' of being a wife, their relationship would have changed. Stedman also never demanded things of her and she worked long hours\n\nPerfect: She told People that she has no regrets about not marrying and having children\n\nThe media mogul met her longtime love in 1986, and they even got engaged in 1992 \u2014 but they never went through with a wedding.\n\n'I was working these 17-hour days, and so were my producers, and then I go home and I have my two dogs and I have Stedman, who's letting me be who I need to be in the world,' she explained.\n\nStedman never demanded things of her, like having dinner on the table \u2014 but Oprah thinks that would have changed had they married.\n\n'That's why I had not just cold feet, I had two feet in a block of cement \u2014 because my feeling was, he is a traditional guy, but this is a completely untraditional relationship,' she reflected.\n\n'If it remained a relationship, I can manage it. If I become the wife, now I've got to play by the rules of whatever that is, and that would not have been pretty.\n\nOf course, not getting married doesn't mean a couple can't have kids, but Oprah ultimately decided that wasn't a path she should go down.\n\nThere for each other: She admitted that her friend Gayle King warned her she'd regret it\n\nAuntie: Gayle has two grown kids of her own (pictured on either side of her with Oprah, right, and Steadman in back)\n\n'Doing the Oprah show allowed me to see the depth of responsibility and sacrifice that is actually required to be a mother. I realized, \"Whoa, I'm talking to a lot of messed-up people, and they are messed up because they had mothers and fathers who were not aware of hoe serious that job is,\"' she said.\n\nGetting married and starting a family weren't always off the table. In fact, at one point while living in Chicago, Oprah even bought an additional apartment to make room for her family to grow.\n\nBut over time, her thoughts on the subject changed, even while best friend Gayle King \u2014 who has two kids \u2014 told her she'd regret it.\n\nStill, Oprah said: 'I have not had one regret about that.'\n\nThat's partly because she gets to fulfill her maternal urges with the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa.\n\nLove: She gets to fulfill her maternal urges with the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa\n\n'They just started calling me Mom Oprah. Which is really, really fine with me because I feel like they are my daughters. They're the daughters I did not have,' she said\n\nSpeaking in a video for People, Oprah, she refers to the girls there as her daughters, saying: 'They just started calling me Mom Oprah. Which is really, really fine with me because I feel like they are my daughters. They're the daughters I did not have.\n\n'This was how having children was supposed to manifest for me. And I never thought that that mothering instinct was something for me.\n\n'I like babies but I like them, like, \"Hi baby! Now go over there,\"' she says with a laugh.\n\n'I like children when they can actually speak to me and tell me what the problem is. And so, 12 years old is really good for that. So getting them at 12 years old was actually perfect for me. That I became a mom of 12-year-olds \u2014 so they're just right for being led to the best parts of themselves.\n\nThis isn't to say Oprah has no regrets in life. The star has been candid about mistakes she thinks she's made, particularly an episode of her show she's most ashamed of.\n\nFlashback: She said a late-80s show in which a man revealed to his wife that his mistress was pregnant was 'one of my greatest shames'\n\nIn 1989, just three seasons into her show, Oprah proclaimed she'd never to sensationalist or 'trash' TV after a guest on a live show took her by surprise.\n\nThey'd invited on a man, a wife, and his mistress, but the talk was more dramatic than she'd expected.\n\n'At the time, the producers thought this was one of the greatest bookings we could ever get. We thought, \"He\u2019s agreed to come on with his girlfriend? This is unbelievable.\"\u2019\n\n'Then there was a moment when the man says to his wife, \"You know what? There\u2019s nothing you can do about [the affair], because [my mistress] is pregnant.\"\n\n'We were live and I didn\u2019t know he was going to tell her, nor did the producers know,' she went on.\n\n'It\u2019s one of my greatest shames, but a shameful act that allowed me to make the shift, because I go, \"Never again will I do that to somebody.\" If I hadn\u2019t, I would have been out of television much sooner.'", "description": "Oprah, 65, and Stedman Graham, 65, have been together since 1986.
