The study states that she refrained from using private jets and only flew on commercial airlines.\n\nOther celebrities that featured in the study were talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Quibi CEO Meg Whitman, late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, racing driver Felix von der Laden and footballer Andre Schurrle.\n\nAs a result of the findings, Stefan Gossling, lead author of the study, has called on celebrities to set a better example.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly looking like the climate crisis can\u2019t be addressed while a small but growing group of super-emitters continue to increase their energy consumption and portray such lifestyles as desirable through their social media channels,\u201d Gossling said.\n\n\u201cAs Greta Thunberg affirmed early on, \u2018The bigger your carbon footprint, the bigger your moral duty\u2019, and flying, as a very energy-intensive activity, has been identified as particularly harmful and socially undesirable.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, celebrity supporters of Extinction Rebellion (XR) called themselves \u201chypocrites\u201d for supporting environmental protests while living \u201chigh carbon lives\u201d.\n\nMore than 100 famous figures, including actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Sir Bob Geldof and actor Sienna Miller, signed an open letter acknowledging that their lifestyles and professions contribute to the \u201cclimate emergency\u201d XR is campaigning to end.\n\nDespite their admission, the celebrities, who recently supported XR\u2019s two-week long disruption in London that grounded flights and caused violent clashes, said they will not be silenced.", "description": "A number of high-profile celebrities have been named by researchers as \u201csuper-emitters\u201d over their \u201charmful\u201d carbon footprints.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/11/509728cf-0fb9-4a45-afa2-dee03a725b57.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
