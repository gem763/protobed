It is what it is. Since I came here, every season it\u2019s the same, the broadcasters are the bosses, it\u2019s not about us.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Klopp admitted he has sympathy for Guardiola\u2019s concerns about City\u2019s upcoming schedule, he rejected the idea that Liverpool will have an easier time of it, pointing out that they will have to travel to Qatar for the Club World Cup.\n\n\u2018We have a game more in December than City. How can we have an advantage?\u2019 said Klopp. \u2018If you ask me about December, where can we fit in an extra game? It\u2019s not possible, but we did it somehow because we have to, because we go to Qatar and play in the Fifa Club World Cup.\n\n\u2018I am completely on City\u2019s side that these games, over 46 hours, should not happen. It\u2019s like when we played Sunderland [in 2016]. It\u2019s just not okay. Three years later we are still speaking about it and nothing has changed. We still have it.\n\n\u2018There are excuses, they [the TV companies] pay a lot of money, that is true. But we still have to work on these things. Forty-eight hours between games is still pretty much unacceptable, but less than 46 hours\u2026 I really get that [City being unhappy]. I understand 100 per cent.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018People will look and go \u2018will they do it? They have injuries? Well, they have a big squad\u2019, the answers are already out there. That\u2019s really not fair. But what can we do?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But do we have an advantage [over City]? I don\u2019t see that.\u2019\n\nWolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo is in a similar position to Guardiola in that his team will face City before then taking on Liverpool less than 48 hours later and he described the scheduling as \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and \u2018dangerous\u2019.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s tough, it\u2019s dangerous,\u2019 Nuno said. \u2018Forty-five hours \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to play another game. It\u2019s absurd, ridiculous. It doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re playing against, it\u2019s about us.", "description": "Jurgen Klopp has rejected Pep Guardiola's claims that Liverpool have an advantage over Manchester City in regards to their Premier League fixtures in December.
