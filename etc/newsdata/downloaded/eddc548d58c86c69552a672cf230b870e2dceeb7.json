Several of the destroyed homes are located in the affluent neighborhood of Brentwood.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be evacuated, to grab their belongings that have been predetermined, take care of their pets, their medications, their papers and to leave that area because the fire is moving right into that area,\u201d Scott said.\n\nGarcetti said that following a thorough investigation, the cause of the fire was \u201can act of God\u201d as a branch ripped by the winds from a eucalyptus tree some 25 feet away from power lines has been blamed for igniting the brush blaze.\n\nAn investigation included dashcam footage of the fire erupting and the tree was well over the required distance from powerlines, but the wind was of such strength that the branch was carried to the lines, causing sparks to fall, he said.\n\n\u201cThis was, simply put in plain parlance, an act of god,\u201d he said.\n\nFire Chief Ralph Terrazas said they\u2019d never returned a cause for a major fire so quickly before.\n\n\u201cIt is an accidental start,\u201d he said.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said in a separate news conference that 43 counties were under red flag warnings due to historic or near historic winds.\n\n\u201cThis has been a tough week,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been a long week.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Newsom declared a state of emergency to combat several fires threatening California, including the Northern California Kincade Fire, which has burned over 76,000 acres and was only 15 percent contained by Tuesday night. However, wind gusts are expected to reach 50 mph on Tuesday and Wednesday. The fire is located in Sonoma County, part of California\u2019s famous wine country.\n\nThe fire has destroyed almost 190 structures including 86 homes and was threatening another 80,435 residences, Cal Fire said.\n\nOver 4,800 firefighters were battling the flames with nearly 560 engines, 75 of which came from Oregon and others from as far as Montana, Newsom said.\n\nFEMA and the Trump administration have been \u201cextraordinarily supportive and helpful\u201d as they have answered every request the state has made, Newsom said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about mutuality, it\u2019s all about our commonwealth, it\u2019s all about \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 our humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the moments when humanity is at scale.\u201d\n\nPacific Gas & Electric said it will cut power Tuesday to nearly 600,000 customers in 29 counties as a fire prevention measure. The shutoff could last until Thursday, based on wind forecasts, the utility said. The company has been switching off power to wind-prone areas in recent weeks, affecting millions of residents.\n\nPG&E said Monday its lines may be responsible for two new fires.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 The National Weather Service issued an \u201cextreme red flag warning\u201d Tuesday evening for much of Los Angeles and Ventura", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
