Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier this week, including urging people to stay indoors.\n\nSome residents taped up their apartment windows in case they shattered.\n\nA typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 left more than 1,200 people dead and a half-million houses flooded.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s Cabinet held a disaster management meeting Friday. He said 17,000 police and military troops were ready for rescue operations.\n\n___\n\n12: 45 p.m.\n\nTonga is ready to say goodbye to captain Siale Piutau and to Sione Kalamafoni, who are retiring from international rugby after the Rugby World Cup game against the United States in Osaka on Sunday. Piutau announced Friday that he was giving up. Kalamafoni made the decision before the tournament in Japan. Both say they want to spend more time with their families.\n\nLoose forward Kalamafoni says \u201cmy wife and I had our third child just a few months ago and hats off to her for staying with them so I could do this. A rugby career involves a lot of sacrifices and it feels like the right time.\u201d\n\nPiutau and Kalamafoni will finish after their 12th Rugby World Cup games, equaling the Tongan record.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor and hopefully we will finish on a high,\u201d Kalamafoni says.\n\nBoth Tonga and the U.S. have lost all three games in Japan, although Tonga came close against France.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re approaching the game as if it\u2019s our grand final,\u201d Tonga coach Toutai Kefu says. \u201cLooking at what we\u2019ve done the last couple of weeks, the improvements we\u2019ve made, we don\u2019t want to undo that and put in a below-par and poor performance.\u201d\n\n___\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nThe Scottish players have tried to be good guests at the Rugby World Cup, until now. Scotland is desperate for Sunday\u2019s Pool A decider to go ahead against Japan. Not because they particularly want to upset the tournament hosts, but because it means they get one last chance to qualify for the quarterfinals. If the game is canceled, Scotland will be out of contention and unbeaten Japan will secure a spot in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals for the first time.\n\nVeteran fullback Stuart Hogg met with reporters in the team hotel at Yokohama on the eve of the game, before a potentially devastating typhoon was set to batter Japan\u2019s main island.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a terrific time in Japan so far \u2026 but we came here with a job in hand and that was to win test matches,\u201d Hogg said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the chance to play against the host nation and it doesn\u2019t get any bigger than that. The focus is on that and making sure we do everything we can to take another step forward.\n\n\u201cThis could be the biggest game of our careers and one we\u2019re very much looking forward to getting stuck into.\u201d\n\nThe Scots haven\u2019t given up hope of having the game played at another venue without a crowd if World Cup organizers decide it\u2019s not safe enough to go ahead with the game at Yokohama. Organizers canceled two games scheduled for Saturday, with three of those teams formally moving into the knockout stage and Italy missing out on last chance to qualify - albeit needing an upset win over the defending champion All Blacks to have any chance.\n\nWorld Rugby investigated relocating those two games - at Yokohama and Toyota - to venues further away from the typhoon\u2019s path but said it wasn\u2019t logistically possible because of safety concerns.\n\n___\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nWith two games already canceled and the prospect of more disruptions as the worst typhoon of the year bears down on Japan, Rugby World Cup organizers have again outlined the plan to assess whether Sunday\u2019s crucial Pool A game between the host team and Scotland can go ahead.\n\nOrganizers took the unprecedented move of declaring 0-0 ties for two games scheduled Saturday - defending champion New Zealand against Italy in Toyota and 2003 champion England against France in Yokohama. So New Zealand and England both topped their groups and Italy missed a chance to push for a spot in the knockout rounds. The only game expected to go ahead Saturday is Ireland against Samoa in Fukuoka.\n\nThere are four games scheduled for Sunday but the last of those - and the last of the group stage - is attracting the most attention.\n\nScotland needs to beat Japan in Yokohama to have a chance of advancing, while the Japanese need only avoid defeat to progress to the quarterfinals for the first time. A decision on that game can be delayed until six hours before kick-off.\n\n\u201cOur primary consideration is the safety of everyone. We will undertake detailed venue inspections as soon as practically possible after the Typhoon has passed, and an update will be published as soon as that process has been undertaken in the morning,\u201d World Rugby said in a statement Saturday. \u201cOur message to fans continues to be stay indoors today, stay safe and monitor official Rugby World Cup social and digital channels.\u201d\n\nTrains and flights have been canceled, and authorities are urging residents and visitors to stay indoors, out of the way of the torrential rain and destructive winds that are expected to hammer Japan\u2019s main island.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Day 23 of the Rugby World Cup in Japan (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/japan_asia_typhoon_rugby_wcup_30905_c0-146-3500-2187_s1200x700.jpg?50e117847fba66c2d01efa712c1454d317fcd0c6", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
