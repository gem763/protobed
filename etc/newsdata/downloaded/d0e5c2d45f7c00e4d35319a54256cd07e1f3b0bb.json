It is an honor to be with all of you to deliver my first speech as Managing Director of the IMF.\n\nI am pleased to continue the tradition of my wonderful predecessor, Christine Lagarde, and discuss the outlook and priorities ahead of our Annual Meetings.\n\nAs many of you know, Christine was a member of the French national synchronized swimming team. So I want to honor her legacy today and borrow the word synchronized for my speech.\n\nWhen I took over as Managing Director, I thought about what the Ministers and Governors might ask the IMF next week. I conferred with David Lipton who has so ably led the Fund in this interim period. And I spoke to many of my new colleagues.\n\nOne question stood out to all of us:\n\nWhat can we all do to help fix the fractures in the global economy and encourage stronger growth?\n\nI want to begin with that this morning.\n\nThankfully, I don\u2019t have to do it alone. I have the support of this great institution, its skilled Executive Board, and its world-class staff.\n\nSo let\u2019s get to it.\n\nThe Outlook\n\nTwo years ago, the global economy was in a synchronized upswing. Measured by GDP, nearly 75 percent of the world was accelerating.\n\nToday, even more of the world economy is moving in synch but, unfortunately, this time growth is decelerating.\n\nIn 2019, we expect slower growth in nearly 90 percent of the world. [1]\n\nThe global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown.\n\nThis widespread deceleration means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade.\n\nNext week we will release our World Economic Outlook which will show downward revisions for 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe headline numbers reflect a complex situation.\n\nDespite this overall deceleration, close to 40 emerging market and developing economies are forecast to have real GDP growth rates above 5 percent \u2014 including 19 in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn the United States and Germany, unemployment is at historic lows. Yet across advanced economies, including in the U.S., Japan, and especially the euro area, there is a softening of economic activity.\n\nIn some of the largest emerging market economies, such as India and Brazil, the slowdown is even more pronounced this year.\n\nIn China, growth is gradually coming down from the rapid pace it saw for many years.\n\nThe precarious outlook presents challenges for countries already facing difficulties \u2014 including some of the Fund\u2019s program countries.\n\nSo why the slowdown in 2019? There are a range of issues and one common theme: Fractures.\n\nI will start with trade. We have spoken in the past about the dangers of trade disputes. Now, we see that they are actually taking a toll.\n\nGlobal trade growth has come to a near standstill.\n\nIn part because of the trade tensions, worldwide manufacturing activity and investment have weakened substantially. There is a serious risk that services and consumption could soon be affected.\n\nAnd the fractures are spreading.\n\nDisputes now extend between multiple countries and into other critical issues. Currencies are once again in the spotlight. Because of our interconnected economies, many more countries will soon feel the impact.\n\nUncertainty \u2014 driven by trade, but also by Brexit, and geopolitical tensions \u2014 is holding back economic potential.\n\nEven if growth picks-up in 2020, the current rifts could lead to changes that last a generation \u2014 broken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a \u201cdigital Berlin Wall\u201d that forces countries to choose between technology systems.\n\nOur goal should be to fix these fractures. Our world is intertwined. So our responses must be coordinated.\n\nI believe we can do it. How? Start by unleashing the growth generating capacity of trade.\n\nUnleash Trade Potential\n\nI said trade tensions were now taking a toll. Let me show you what I mean.\n\nThis graphic is part of the updated analysis on tariffs we will release next week. It shows the projected global GDP loss from the escalating trade conflict between the US and China.\n\nThe blue, yellow, and purple blocks show the direct costs on businesses and consumers from the three rounds of implemented and announced tariffs.\n\nNow, look at the red blocks. This is what happens when the expected secondary effects are added in \u2014 including the loss of confidence and market reactions.\n\nThe results are clear. Everyone loses in a trade war. For the global economy, the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a loss of around $700 billion by 2020, or about 0.8 percent of GDP. As a reference, this is approximately the size of Switzerland\u2019s entire economy.\n\nSo we need to work together, now, and find a lasting solution on trade.\n\nThis requires difficult decisions and political will. But it is worth it.\n\nWe need real change.\n\nCountries need to address legitimate concerns related to their trade practices. That means dealing with subsidies, as well as intellectual property rights and technology transfers.\n\nWe also need a more modern global trading system, particularly to unlock the full potential of services and e-commerce.\n\nAnd every country must do more to help communities harmed by the dislocations associated with technology and trade.\n\nThe key is to improve the system, not abandon it.\n\nAccess to new markets is essential to raise living standards. It is part of the answer to our question on addressing fractures. But what about the other part? Encouraging higher growth and creating more opportunity?\n\nWhen it comes to improving people\u2019s lives, the hard work starts at home. I learned this lesson first-hand growing up behind the Iron Curtain. I saw the high costs of bad policies. And I also saw how a shift to good policies, with international support, can help put a country and its people back on the path to prosperity.\n\nSo, let me focus on the domestic policy priorities we believe are critical to accelerate growth and build more resilient economies. And then I want to turn to how a renewed commitment to international cooperation \u2014 and synchronized policy action \u2014 can help us more fully address our fractures.\n\nPolicy Priorities to Secure Stronger and More Resilient Growth\n\n1. Use Monetary Policy Wisely & Enhance Financial Stability\n\nLet\u2019s begin with monetary policy and financial stability. Central banks around the world are striving to fulfill their mandates under difficult circumstances. Their independence is the foundation of sound monetary policy.\n\nHow can they best fulfill their mandates? They should communicate their plans clearly, remain data dependent, and where appropriate keep interest rates low. Especially since inflation is still subdued in many countries and overall growth is weakening.\n\nHowever, interest rates are already very low or even negative in many advanced economies. So in those places, there may be limited space to do more with conventional tools.\n\nProlonged low rates also come with negative side effects and unintended consequences. Think of pension funds and life insurance companies that are taking on more risky investments to meet their return objectives. In our surveillance, we see such an increase of risk taking by investors broadly around the globe.\n\nAll of this creates financial vulnerabilities. In some countries, firms are using low rates and building up debt to fund mergers and acquisitions instead of investing.\n\nOur new analysis shows that if a major downturn occurs, corporate debt at risk of default would rise to $19 trillion, ornearly 40 percent of the total debt in eight major economies. [2] This is above the levels seen during the financial crisis.\n\nLow interest rates are also prompting investors to search for higher yields in emerging markets. This leaves many smaller economies exposed to a sudden reversal of capital flows.\n\nSo we need macroprudential tools. And we can use new approaches to better manage debt, reduce financial booms and busts, and contain volatility.\n\nBut we should state one thing very clearly. Monetary and financial policies cannot do the job alone. Fiscal policy must play a central role.\n\nI have heard the quip that the IMF stands for \u201cIt\u2019s Mostly Fiscal.\u201d Let me be true to form and focus on fiscal policy next.\n\n2. Deploy Fiscal Tools to Meet Current Challenges\n\nNow is the time for countries with room in their budgets to deploy \u2014 or get ready to deploy \u2014 fiscal firepower. In fact, low interest rates may give some policymakers additional money to spend.\n\nIn places such as Germany, the Netherlands, and South Korea, an increase in spending \u2014 especially in infrastructure and R&D \u2014 will help boost demand and growth potential.\n\nThat advice will not work everywhere. Globally, public debt is near record levels. So in countries with a high debt-to-GDP ratio, fiscal restraint continues to be warranted.\n\nCountries will, of course, tailor policies that work for them. But in every country, reducing debts and deficits should always be done in a way that protects education, health, and jobs.\n\nAnd every country needs to wrestle with the question of where, in a rapidly changing world, new sources of growth will come from. I believe focusing on fundamentals can help.\n\nOne way to create more fiscal space is through domestic revenue mobilization. Reducing corruption and utilizing digital tools in tax collection can unlock resources and fuel new investments in people. It can also help countries reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n3. Implement Structural Reforms for Future Growth\n\nAs countries decide which policies make the most sense for this moment, we all need to keep an eye on the horizon.\n\nPotential job losses from automation and shifting demographics require countries to reform the structure of their economies.\n\nIf we do not act, many countries will be stuck in mediocre growth.\n\nNew IMF research \u2014 focused specifically on emerging markets and developing economies \u2014 shows how structural reforms can raise productivity and generate enormous economic gains .\n\nThese changes are the key to achieving higher growth over the medium and long-term.\n\nThe right reforms in the right sequence could double the speed at which emerging markets and developing economies reach the living standards of the advanced economies. [3]\n\nWe also know that when countries undertake reforms at the same time there can be a positive spillover effect.\n\nWhich policies work best? Let me give you some examples. [4]\n\nIn Chile , childcare programs lifted female labor force participation and helped the economy. Proving, by the way, that empowering women is an economic gamechanger.\n\n, childcare programs lifted female labor force participation and helped the economy. Proving, by the way, that empowering women is an economic gamechanger. In Ghana , anti-corruption legislation created more transparency and accountability.\n\n, anti-corruption legislation created more transparency and accountability. In Jamaica, which is completing an IMF-supported program, cutting red tape made it easier to start a new business.\n\nThese types of reforms help people find new opportunities, reduce excessive inequality, and enable countries to prepare for shocks.\n\nHere I would like to acknowledge that today the Fund will host a conference in honor of one of our young researchers \u2014 Giang Ho \u2014 who studied many of these issues and sadly passed away last year.\n\nTo borrow a proverb from her home country of Vietnam: \u201c The time to jump is before your feet get wet.\u201d\n\nThis is true. If we wait until the next crisis, it will be too late.\n\nWe need to act now.\n\nWe also need to act together.\n\n4. Embrace International Cooperation\n\nHere is what I see. While the need for international cooperation is going up, the will to engage is going down. Trade is a case in point. And yet, we need to work together. From safely adapting to fintech, to fully implementing the financial regulatory reform agenda, to fighting money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nAnd we need to work together to address climate change.\n\nClimate Change\n\nIt is a crisis where no one is immune and everyone has a responsibility to act.\n\nOne of our priorities at the IMF is to assist countries as they reduce carbon emissions and become more climate resilient.\n\nAt the current average carbon price of $2 per ton, most people and most companies have little financial incentive to make this transition. Limiting global warming to a safe level requires a significantly higher carbon price.\n\nSome countries have embraced a straightforward strategy \u2014 taxing carbon.\n\nHere is a good example: when Sweden introduced a carbon tax in 1991, low- and middle-income households received higher transfers and tax cuts to help offset higher energy costs. That policy shift has been instrumental in reducing Sweden\u2019s carbon emissions by 25 percent since 1995, while its economy has grown by over 75 percent.\n\nNew research in our upcoming Fiscal Monitor confirms that carbon taxes can be one of the most powerful and efficient tools. But the key here is to change tax systems, not simply add a new tax. [5]\n\nAdditional revenues could be used to cut taxes elsewhere and fund assistance to millions of affected households. These new resources could also support investments in the clean energy infrastructure that will help the planet heal.\n\nDealing with climate change requires not only mitigating damage, but also adapting for the future. Adaptation is about many things, but it is mostly about pricing risk and providing incentives for investment, including in new technologies.\n\nIMF analysis from the Global Financial Stability Report shows progress is being made in the private financial sector. So-called green bonds are now on the rise in Europe and parts of Asia. [6] This is a very good development, but it is not nearly enough.\n\nThe price of inaction is high. We recognize each country faces unique challenges and constraints. But we can \u2014 and we must \u2014 cooperate on this challenge now and work together in a way that generates renewed confidence in multilateralism.\n\nI have often said that making the case for cooperation to a more skeptical world requires delivering real results in people\u2019s lives .\n\nIt also means reminding everyone of the power of partnership in times of crisis. This brings me to my conclusion, and a thought about our uncertain future.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf the global economy slows more sharply than expected, a coordinated fiscal response may be needed.\n\nLet me be clear. We are not there. But when it comes to preparing for the possibility of a coordinated response we should remember the advice of Shakespeare:\n\n\u201cBetter three hours too soon, than a minute too late.\u201d [7]\n\nOur research shows that changes in spending are more effective and have a multiplier effect when countries act together.\n\nOr, put another way \u2014 if the synchronized slowdown worsens , we may need a synchronized policy response.\n\nWe have seen how effective this approach can be in the recent past. Think about 2009 and the G20 commitment to a joint stimulus.\n\nIt is an important reminder of how countries can protect their own citizens, while leveraging international cooperation for mutual benefit.\n\nLet me conclude where I began \u2014 with the image of synchronized swimming.\n\nThe world economy is still growing, it is just growing too slowly. To reverse this trend, and meet the aspirations of people, we cannot afford to be complacent. We must act.\n\nNext week, as our 189-member countries gather together in Washington, I urge them to come prepared to find solutions.\n\nI am confident that if we cooperate \u2014 mindful of each other\u2019s challenges and interests \u2014 we can deliver a better future for all.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\n\n[1] As measured by real GDP (at PPP rates) [2] Forthcoming Global Financial Stability Report, Chapter 1.
