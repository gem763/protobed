There was too much pressure and it set up the race for Aethero,\u201d Yiu said.\n\n\u201cI said to the owner \u2018last season when he was on his own he won three \u2013 no one came at him. Up at this level he gets other horses around him and it might burn him out\u2019. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nPurton had similar sentiments about the effort of Voyage Warrior.\n\n\u201cI thought he was disappointing,\u201d Purton said. \u201cIt\u2019s never a good thing when two horses go head-to-head and unfortunately Multimillion didn\u2019t come back and give either horse much of a chance.\n\n\u201cI knew we were going a little bit too fast but I was mindful of not restraining him too much because of this breathing issue that he may have, so you\u2019ve got to find a happy medium. I would rather keep him happy than fight him.\n\n\u201cBut when I asked him for something there was just nothing there. He didn\u2019t handle the pressure today. It was only his first start of the season, no doubt he\u2019s better than what he showed today and hopefully he can bounce back.\u201d\n\nGet yourself to a because Thanks Forever V Voyage Warrior V Aethero is going to be an absolute cracker pic.twitter.com/6A5wKFEkh9 \u2014 Adam Campton (@adamcampton) October 12, 2019\n\nYiu had hoped to plot a path to December\u2019s Group One Longines Hong Kong Sprint via the Group Two Jockey Club Sprint, but will go back to the drawing board now, with a Class Two 1,200m contest on November 3 the likely next step.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a 1,200m race \u2013 it won\u2019t be as tough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be his first time stepping up over that trip and we\u2019ll see how he goes.\u201d", "description": "Ricky Yiu Poon-fai snared a double at Sha Tin on Saturday, but he went home pretty flat after his boom sprinter Voyage Warrior suffered his second defeat while stablemate Alcari was a certainty beaten in the last....", "authors": ["Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/12/7070fbac-ece4-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_200650.JPG?itok=LWIhStyb&v=1570882015", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
