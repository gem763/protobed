(Image: Warner Bros/New Line Cinema)\n\nThe A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise has been in limbo for a long time, following a disastrous 2010 remake that didn\u2019t do Freddy Krueger or his fearful fans any favours. And while there isn\u2019t any news about the next time we see Freddy on screen (and we know there\u2019s going to be a next time, some things just don\u2019t end), we at least know more about the legal situation behind the villain.\n\nAs reported by Bloody Disgusting, after 35 years the rights for A Nightmare on Elm Street in the United States have reverted to estate for the late Wes Craven. And while these things are always messy and legally fraught, this seems to mean that the domestic rights for the Freddy franchise are in the hands of the people in charge of managing Craven\u2019s estate along with it. It is, after all, pretty impossible to make a Freddy movie without using the character and ideas that originated in that film.\n\nAs Bloody Disgusting explains, though, that doesn\u2019t mean this is suddenly an auteur-led franchise. Warner Bros/New Line Cinema still holds the international rights. But it does mean that the company will have to come to the table with Craven\u2019s estate to make anything that releases domestically, which is, probably, just about everything and anything.\n\nDoes this news foreshadow the long-awaited return of Freddy? Well, if nothing else, it means he\u2019s on somebody\u2019s mind. Maybe even in their\u2026 dreams?
