I don't know why she [the head teacher] hasn't said anything to me in person.\"\n\nThe mum said she wouldn't have been so upset if she had known that her son was offered a hot meal first.\n\nShe had pulled Jayden out of school, but sent him back the next day after being threatened with a fine for an unauthorised absence.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\n\nMiss Jarvis said she spoke to the head teacher on the phone last Friday after Jayden returned to school to ask for assurances for the future.\n\nBut in a blistering letter, the head teacher accused Miss Jarvis of only speaking on the phone to get \"enough information\" to pass onto the media.\n\nThe head wrote in the letter: \"I went out of my way on Friday, during our telephone conversation, so that we could move forward and out the incident behind us, to ensure the best for Jayden.\n\n\"It has now become apparent that the sole purpose of the conversation was so that you could gain enough information for a follow up newspaper report.\n\n(Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\n\n\"Once again completely based on untruths and misquotes.\"\n\nThe letter tells Miss Jarvis she has caused a great deal of stress and upset to all the staff at the school.\n\nThe head teacher signs off by telling Miss Jarvis she will continue to do her best for \"all of her children\".\n\nHowever, she warns her she will be banned from the school site if she is \"rude\" and \"aggressive\" again.\n\nMiss Jarvis, also mum to Alisha, seven, and Cole, five, said she \"does not know what to do now\".\n\nShe added: \"That was not the case. I wanted to talk to her to resolve it. I'm fuming about that because that wasn't the fact.\"\n\nIn a statement to Hull Live, the head teacher said: \"Thanet school promotes five key values of respect, responsibility, kindness, honesty and friendship.\n\n\"I have written to Miss Jarvis to request she adheres to these values.\u201d\n\nHead teacher's letter in full\n\n\"Dear Miss Jarvis\n\n\"I am writing to express to you both my sadness and disappointment in your actions towards both the school and myself last week.\n\n\"As a school we have the 5 key values of respect, responsibility, kindness, honesty and friendship that we expect everyone who visits the school, both children and adults, to follow.\n\n\"Your behaviour and actions last week have shown a complete disregard for all of these.\n\n\"You were rude and aggressive towards both the staff in our Admin Team and myself. I also received complaints from children, staff and parents regarding the inappropriate language you were using on the school site, in front of children.\n\n\"Despite knowing full well that we did not run out of hot food last Tuesday, that in fact Jayden had already tried a serving of Shepherd's Pie before being offered a tuna sandwich, this is without taking into account the desserts available, you still agreed to a newspaper report based solely on the basis that the school had run out of hot meals.\n\n\"This has caused a great deal of stress and upset to all the staff at the school, but especially those that tried to encourage Jayden and ensure he had something to eat.\n\n\"Putting that to one side, I went out of my way on Friday, during our telephone conversation, so that we could move forward and out the incident behind us, to ensure the best for Jayden.\n\n\"It has now become apparent that the sole purpose of the conversation was so that you could gain enough information for a follow up newspaper report. Once again completely based on untruths and mis-quotes.\n\n\"Myself and the staff at Thanet will continue to do our very best for all of your children and all others that attend the school.\n\n\"However, I will not tolerate a repeat of this type of behaviour towards either the school or the staff.\n\n\"If this happens again I will have to take further advice which could result in you being banned from the school site.\n\n\"Thank you for your support in this matter.\n\n\"Head teacher\"", "description": "Stacy Jarvis claimed her son Jayden went all day \"without food\" because the canteen ran out of hot meals while he \"took his time\" in the toilet - but changed her story after the head teacher wrote a scathing letter about \"untruths\"", "authors": ["Joanna Lovell", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Hull Daily Mail", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587831.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195579203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
