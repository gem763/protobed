In fact, it\u2019s so committed to their success that it provides dedicated small business relationship managers (BRMs) to each of its clients. BRMs are the first point of contact for business clients and provide both business guidance and tailored financial solutions on a one-to-one basis.\n\nOne client group at HSBC that benefits considerably from BRM support is the professional services sector \u2013 doctors, lawyers, accountants, veterinarians, architects, engineers and others who operate businesses built around their own professional services.\n\nFor Jonny Minh Huynh, a BRM with HSBC Bank Canada in Surrey, BC, serving professionals means developing a thorough understanding of their business.\n\nClients \u201ccan reach me directly and I\u2019ll be their point of contact,\u201d says Business Relationship Manager Ankita Singh. \u201cFor a doctor or other professional, that speed is critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know why they got into the business,\u201d he says. \u201cThey may want to remain a small office or have an appetite to expand. HSBC has a slate of products and services available to all small businesses, and as a BRM I provide value by directing them to the products and services most relevant to them. It\u2019s like building a house. I want to make sure that they begin by choosing the accounts that make sense for the business and then we can carefully build on that foundation.\u201d\n\nProfessionals with small offices, for example, often begin by operating their businesses from a personal bank account. That\u2019s something HSBC BRMs are quick to correct, ensuring that personal and professional accounts are separated both for business and tax purposes. They\u2019re encouraged to set up purpose-driven accounts, for example a chequing account where they set aside the GST or HST they collect, so there\u2019s no problem making quarterly or annual payments. Different types of HSBC accounts are clearly delineated and offer fully transparent fee structures that help business owners make informed choices. Plus, the HSBC Unlimited Chequing account offers no monthly fees* to new business clients until December 31, 2019.\n\n\u201cHowever, for professional services clients, their business is often still very closely tied to their personal finances,\u201d says Nicole Whyte, BRM with HSBC Bank Canada in Toronto. \u201cThey need and want to have everything integrated seamlessly. Using HSBCs online dashboard feature, even when their accounts are separated, they can see all of their personal and business accounts side by side.\u201d\n\nProfessionals generally work extremely long hours, so doubling as the business manager of their company only adds to a heavy workload.\n\n\u201cOften, banking is their last priority,\u201d says Ankita Singh, BRM with HSBC Bank Canada in Edmonton. \u201cThey often have no time to come into the branch, but I\u2019m available to them, whether through text, phone, video conference or email. They don\u2019t have to reach me through a call centre. They reach me directly and I will be their first point of contact. For a doctor or other professional, that speed is critical.\u201d\n\nHSBC\u2019s online and phone banking services are also available to professionals 24/7. In addition, HSBC Bank Canada provides them with free access to cloud-based Sage applications that seamlessly integrate their bank accounts with the accounting package.\n\nFor professionals working a sole proprietors or unincorporated businesses, Huynh has suggested they speak to a corporate accountant about the advantages of establishing a professional corporation, a business entity that expands the range of tax advantages available to them.\n\nHSBC can also offer a wide range of credit products that can help a professional services business to grow, from business credit cards to low-interest lines of credit, TFSA-secured loans, installment loans and personal and commercial mortgages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to match the purpose with the loan product,\u201d says Huynh. \u201cIf a veterinarian wants to invest in an MRI unit so that the business no longer has to outsource that service, we want to fully understand their needs and how it will improve the business before structuring that loan.\u201d\n\nSome professional services businesses continue to grow, even beyond the scope of a BRM. HSBC\u2019s commercial banking division can help them meet the more complex needs of a larger business, such as more intricate loan facilities, more complex payroll systems and accounts offering additional features.\n\n\u201cAs a BRM dedicated to my professional services clients, it begins with having a great conversation,\u201d says Huynh. \u201cBut it also means continuing that conversation throughout their relationship with HSBC, while providing them with the support that allows them to concentrate on what they do best.\u201d\n\n*Terms and conditions apply.\n\nThis story was created by Content Works, Postmedia\u2019s commercial content division, on behalf of HSBC Bank Canada.", "description": "HSBC business relationship managers share their insights and advice for professionals", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1140336148.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
