So, naturally, I can\u2019t help but wonder whether this extraordinary (i.e., nothing like this has happened in my lifetime) deviation from convention to restrict capital flows to China could be followed by these other steps when/if the circumstances that I\u2019m describing unfold.\u201d Ray Dalio\n\nDalio said the U.S. president can unilaterally cut off capital flows to China, freeze payments on the debts owed to China and use sanctions to inhibit non-American financial transactions with the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nThe Bridgewater co-chairman\u2019s comments come after reports on Friday from Bloomberg indicated that the U.S. was considering a move to delist Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges.\n\nThe Treasury Department in recent interviews hasn\u2019t exactly put to rest last week\u2019s reports of limiting capital flows to China.\n\nDespite blasting an initial Bloomberg News report on it as \u201cfake news,\u201d White House adviser Peter Navarro on Monday said in an interview with CNBC that there were significant issues about Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges.\n\nU.S. stocks on Tuesday dropped sharply, with the Dow industrials DJIA, -1.28% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.23% suffering their worst one-day skids since Aug. 23, after the worst reading on a U.S. manufacturing index in a decade.", "description": "Ray Dalio, the founder of the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, say reports of the U.S. limiting capital flows to China may just be the start.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC810_ray_da_ZG_20190128123353.jpg"}
