However, just because talking about money is on trend doesn\u2019t mean you have to reveal everything right away.\n\nAt The Financial Diet, Nikki Visciglia explains how sharing her financial situation during the early stages of a relationship cost her\u2014literally.\n\nHe knew how much money I had saved at that point, and much like I had not seen the work that went into my mum elevating our financial status after her divorce, he had not seen the effort that went into saving that money. When deciding who would pay for a meal, he would frequently reference my bank account: \u201cBut you have so much money!\u201d First I would reply, \u201cRight, because I don\u2019t spend it.\u201d But as it became obvious that my reasoning fell on deaf ears, my rebuttals became scarce, and I ended up footing the bill more than half the time. That summer, I ended up burning through the $1,450 in my checking account.\n\nVisciglia writes about how she and her boyfriend were trying to live like they were in a long-term committed relationship\u2014splitting expenses proportionally, making career decisions based on the other person\u2019s needs\u2014even though their relationship was nowhere near \u201clong-term\u201d yet.\n\nWhether my now ex-boyfriend purposely manipulated me into paying for more things because he knew I had the capability, or if he also exaggerated the depth of our connection and believed we should live as a married couple who picks up for the other\u2019s slack, the end result remains the same. I was out more money than I should have been, and as anyone else around us could have clearly foretold, we broke up.\n\nI absolutely understand this impulse to get too financially serious too early, because I\u2019ve been there myself. When I was in my 20s, and a few months into one of my first \u201ccould this be the one\u201d relationships, I learned that the person I was dating had a little bit of debt. (Just a couple grand, if I recall correctly.) I was making more money than he was, and I remember how much I wanted to say \u201clet me help you pay that off.\u201d We were young! We were in love! We were going to support each other and share our resources! We were... going to break up within the year.\n\nOf course, I\u2019ve also been on the other side of the financial picture, where the person I just started dating offered to pay for everything (or nearly everything) because they were earning more than I was\u2014and that also felt a little weird and occasionally a little manipulative. (\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay for it\u201d isn\u2019t a good response to \u201cno.\u201d)\n\nSo when should you bring up money in a relationship? You might have to do the difficult work of addressing the subject naturally\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s not in my budget\u201d\u2014while still being coy about exactly how much you\u2019ve got in your paycheck or your savings account. You could also do the \u201cperson who asks, pays\u201d thing, giving each of you the opportunity to suggest dates that are within your price range.\n\nYou could even follow the somewhat old-fashioned advice to date someone for \u201cfour full seasons\u201d (aka \u201cone year\u201d) before making any serious decisions about the relationship, including whether to reveal how much money you actually have.\n\nBut whatever you do, don\u2019t spill all of your financial beans in the early stages of a new relationship\u2014because both you and the other party might assume that those beans are what\u2019s going to fund the next several months of dating.", "description": "If you think you\u2019re earning more money than the person you just started dating, it might be a good idea to keep that to yourself\u2014at least for a little while....", "authors": ["Ronelle Welton", "Bill Nimorakiotakis", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xqvizfogv89uljvxwcn8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
