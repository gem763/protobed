Enter the upgraded four-cylinder EcoBoost model, which now offers a feistier turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four exhumed from the defunct Ford Focus RS, along with transformative racetrack hardware.\n\nConventionalists have stigmatized six- and four-cylinder muscle cars since the days of old, when there was nothing muscular about either engine type. Things are different today. The current Mustang EcoBoost's standard turbo four-banger makes 310 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. For comparison, the fourth-gen Mustang GT, with its 4.6-liter V-8, maxed out at 260 ponies and 302 lb-ft. Still, the EcoBoost's huge power advantage has been diminished by its bashful exhaust note and less energetic behavior\u2014at least until now.\n\nPhoto credit: Ford More\n\nGhost of Focus RS Past\n\nThe newly available High Performance package swaps the base EcoBoost spec engine for a detuned version of the 2.3-liter unit that powered the all-wheel-drive Focus RS. Ford accomplished this by recalibrating it to work with the standard six-speed manual and optional 10-speed automatic transmissions, as well as making it work long-ways in the rear-drive 'Stang. Also added were a larger twin-scroll turbo compressor, a bigger radiator, and an active exhaust system. Output is now 332 horses\u201418 less than the RS made\u2014and the same 350 lb-ft as before. Ford says the RS-derived EcoBoost mill brings broader horsepower and torque curves; the engine is most responsive between 2500 and 5300 rpm.\n\nWe were immediately smitten by the EcoBoost's newfound voice on our drive along California's snaking coastline. The updated engine's aural character and throttle response are notably better than the Mustang's base turbo-four, growling like a baby lion at startup and snorting through the rev range. While there's a brief hesitation in throttle response just off idle, the 2.3-liter is entertaining and encourages you to chase its 6500-rpm redline. Even the optional automatic gearbox's ability to smoothly shuffle its 10 ratios impresses, both in the default D position and the sportier S setting. The latter mode proved the best for maximizing thrust out of tight and twisty corners; simply tickle the throttle and the automatic will snap into the optimal gear and hold it to redline. Of course, we have a sweet spot for the Mustang's standard manual transmission, and the six-speed's notchy shifter and progressive clutch action don't disappoint either. Unlike V-8 models, though, four-cylinder Mustangs do not feature automatic rev-matching for those who can't heel-and-toe shift.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Ford More", "description": "The latest four-cylinder pony car offers the heart of a Focus RS and transformative racetrack hardware.", "authors": ["Eric Stafford"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qRwzi7KrR913nQqGVj0gVw--~B/aD03MTc7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/682535f39e5738886609b2521bb9db52", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
