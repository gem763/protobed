They reportedly found a framed KKK membership application hanging on a wall, along with Confederate flags.\n\nARIZONA TROOPER ARRESTED ON SEX-RELATED, KIDNAPPING AND FRAUD CHARGES: POLICE\n\n\u201cIn the bedroom, right across \u2026 there was a plaque up there, all by itself,\" Mathis told a local news outlet.\n\nHe described what he saw in a viral Facebook post that prompted city officials to look into the matter. The inquiry was intended to determine whether Anderson, who is white, violated city policy.\n\n\u201cSome questions arose that we\u2019d like to have further answered,\" Muskegon Police Chief Jeffrey Lewis told city commissioners during an Aug. 27 meeting to announce the end of the inquiry. \u201cBut I can tell you this, after reviewing this -- and it was a quite lengthy investigation -- what you saw on social media pretty much stands the way it is.\"\n\n\u201cThere was no smoking gun revealed to us or anything that shocked us,\" he added.\n\nAnderson had been on the force since 1997. He was cleared of wrongdoing in the 2009 fatal shooting of an unarmed black man following an investigation.\n\nA report by then-Muskegon County Prosecutor Tony Tague found that Julius Johnson hit Anderson in the head with a police radio and \"another blunt object\" and noted that Anderson was forced to get a metal plate installed in his head.\n\nMathis said he was \"glad the city was moving forward in a positive direction.\" He also said Anderson's firing would do little to change a police culture where officers protect each other and fail to hold one another accountable, MLive reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThere are other officers within the police force that have been to Anderson\u2019s home and were well aware of the Confederate flags,\u201d Mathis claimed. \"[Officers who] contributed to that behavior, instead of saying we as a police force are supposed to have good attitudes when making decisions for our community.\n\n\u201cThese KKK applications, flags, they\u2019re not indicative of people who should protect and serve our community.\u201d", "description": "A Michigan police officer who was put on leave after a potential homebuyer found Ku Klux Klan memorabilia inside the officer's house\u00a0was fired Thursday following an investigation.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/KKK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
