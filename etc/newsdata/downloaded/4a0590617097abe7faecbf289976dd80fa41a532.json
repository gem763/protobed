Photo: Courtesy of the Retailer\n\nI have a bit of a thing for nonelectric coffee-makers. The French press I bought a few years ago brings me endless delight \u2014 plunge! \u2014 as does the Bialetti Moka pot, whose stovetop hissing I\u2019ll never mistake. I prefer manual brewers not just because they produce a more distinctive cup but because they\u2019re extremely fun to use, like toys for adults. The device that most excites me lately is the Neapolitan flip coffeepot, which I acquired last month from the MoMA Design Store (though, of course, you can find it at Amazon, too). It is the weirdest coffee-maker I own. I love it.\n\nThe flip coffeepot, so named for its popularity in Naples, even though it\u2019s a French invention, is a three-part gadget that seems implausible. Basically, you fill the bottom portion of the pot with water, add your grounds to the middle filter, screw on the top, and set the thing to a flame. When it boils, you flip the whole pot over (that little lid with the handle up top comes off), so the hot water seeps through the filter and into the empty chamber, which has a spout. Then you remove the emptied part and you\u2019ve got yourself a little pot of hot coffee. That\u2019s it.\n\nI\u2019ve been using my flip pot for a month now, and I\u2019ve grown quite fond of it. Here\u2019s what\u2019s special about it: It makes the perfect amount of coffee for one person \u2014 I know it says six, but it makes about four cups\u2019 worth max \u2014 and produces a clean but concentrated cup. The texture doesn\u2019t get as muddy as French-press coffee, and its a little less intense than Moka coffee, which can sometimes get overwhelmingly strong. I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who works from home or enjoys a Sunday a.m. cup. It will, I am sure, make the mornings extremely fun.\n\nAnother Strat-approved manual coffee brewer\n\nAeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker Travel writer Andrew Parks knows all about making coffee on the road.
