[YONAHP]\n\nThe Korea Football Association will likely lose all communication with South Korea\u2019s national football team from today through Wednesday while they stay in Pyongyang to play a qualifying match against the North Korean national football squad for the 2022 World Cup.According to a local government official on Sunday, North Korea is ignoring the South\u2019s repeated requests to send a cheerleading squad and for the national football team to fly directly from Incheon International Airport to Pyongyang via a 40-minute flight. Instead, the team will be arriving in Pyongyang after a much lengthier journey, passing through China. The team, which flew to Beijing on Sunday to apply for visas from the North Korean Embassy, is due to land in Pyongyang today.More concerning is the situation regarding communication with the team, as it will be cut off from the moment they leave Beijing. \u201cCell phones brought into North Korea from other countries are not permitted roaming services in the North, and the act of taking cell phones into the North may be against North Korean sanctions,\u201d a diplomatic source said Sunday. \u201cThe players\u2019 cell phones and laptops are all planned to be kept in the Korean Embassy in Beijing and will be handed back when they return from Pyongyang.\u201dPyongyang might allow the South Korean players to make international phone calls from their lodging facilities or lend them cell phones - which cannot make international calls - so they can communicate with each other.The team must also make sure any belongings they bring on the trip return with them. According to a government official, the United States allowed the team to bring necessities for the match, but the permission was subject to the condition that those necessities must return to the South.\u201cThe two Koreas promised to expand social, cultural and sports exchanges in the Panmunjom Declaration and Pyongyang declaration of last year, but it seems like we are back in the past,\u201d a government official playing a part in the national team\u2019s visit to Pyongyang said. \u201cIf this kind of mood between the two Koreas persists, it will mean a red light for the decision of forming joint teams for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and co-hosting the 2032 Olympics.\u201dBY JEONG YONG-SOO, CHEA SARAH [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/13211137.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
