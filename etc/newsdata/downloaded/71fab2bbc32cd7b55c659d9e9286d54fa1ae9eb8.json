Garmin must know what I like as it just announced two new additions to the Legacy Saga series with Darth Vader and Rey models for adults.\n\nI am tempted to purchase the Darth Vader model for the Tie Fighter watch face alone. While this is a cool watch face, the experience also includes Star Wars avatar options and Star Wars-themed award badges for successfully completing fitness and exercise achievements.\n\nThe Rey model is available in 40mm while the Darth Vader one is 45mm. These Star Wars-themed watches are available for $399.99 and are essentially themed Vivoactive 4 watches.", "description": "Garmin continues to release new wearables with a few models featuring popular Disney design elements.
