It may soon enter its second month.\n\nDraghi\u2019s insistence on pushing ahead with more bond purchases at the Sept. 12 policy meeting, relying on governors from southern economies and the euro\u2019s smallest countries to defeat opposition from colleagues in the region\u2019s core, now has another twist. It turns out the panel of officials advising policy makers on what to do was against QE as well.\n\nThe leak of that information to the Financial Times extended a narrative of controversy that burst into the public domain with a flurry of interviews starting on Sept. 13 from governors on either side of the debate, followed by the resignation of an ECB board member, and then a further exchange of blows as former policy makers weighed in.\n\nThe schism looks increasingly likely to scar Draghi\u2019s legacy -- and the longer it lasts, the more it also threatens to spill into the reign of his successor, Christine Lagarde, who takes office on Nov. 1.\n\nWhile Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Friday that the Governing Council is \u201cturning the page,\u201d that remains to be seen. With his Italian, German, and Dutch colleagues all scheduled to deliver speeches next week around the International Monetary Fund meetings, the argument might keep going.\n\nThe FT story prompted a warning on Thursday from Olli Rehn, head of the Finnish central bank, about the damage the spat can cause.\n\n\u201cI myself am a product of democratic culture and football teams,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV. \u201cIf you are divided you tend to lose games. If you are united, you tend to score and tend to win.\u201d\n\nRehn was one of the first governors to defend the decision in September. At the time, his dissenting colleagues were mounting a rapid assault.\n\nBundesbank President Jens Weidmann, Draghi\u2019s most prominent and longstanding critic, told Germany\u2019s tabloid Bild newspaper that the ECB delivered a package out of proportion with an economic prognosis that \u201cisn\u2019t that bad.\u201d Dutch Governor Klaas Knot even released a statement explaining his opposition. Austria\u2019s Robert Holzmann said the stimulus may have been a mistake.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s chief economist, Philip Lane, and the governors of the Spanish, Greek and Cypriot central banks later followed Rehn in coming publicly to Draghi\u2019s aid, in a signal of concern that the hawks were dominating the public narrative.\n\nThe president himself chose to give only a brief response to the controversy in his last appearance to the European Parliament, on Sept. 23, saying that communication of dissent shouldn\u2019t \u201cundermine the effectiveness of our decisions.\u201d\n\nThe matter could have ended there, but it didn\u2019t. The next day, Villeroy Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau broke his silence to admit he too opposed bond purchases.\n\nA day later, Sabine Lautenschlaeger became the third German Executive Board member in a row to quit without finishing their eight-year term. She was also against more QE, though she didn\u2019t say if that was a reason for her exit.\n\nThe past week has seen former senior policy makers join the fray. Two ex-chief economists of the ECB, Otmar Issing and Juergen Stark, along with some previous heads of the German, Austrian and Dutch central banks, published a memorandum criticizing Draghi\u2019s policies. In a direct riposte, Peter Praet, who left as chief economist earlier this year, told Bloomberg that \u201cthis sort of noise at the end of the mandate is not helpful.\u201d\n\nThe ECB\u2019s own account of the September meeting published on Thursday reinforced the message that it was a messy debate. Policy makers agreed on the need for action but split on almost every element of the package. Some even rejected a rate cut, the most conventional option on the table.\n\nThe revelation on the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s advice provides an extra glimpse on the extent of disagreement. One former top policy maker, speaking on condition of anonymity last month, wondered aloud if the president\u2019s insistence on overriding such opposition might prove in the long run to have damaged the institution.\n\nEnsuring that the ECB can shake off this controversy will be a key challenge for Lagarde. In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Sept. 24, she gave a hint of how she will approach the matter -- in words similar to those of Rehn.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that we are a team, that we disagree amongst ourselves and then, once the disagreement is settled, once there is a common line, that we all move together -- I think that has a huge impact,\u201d she said.", "description": "28 Days Later, Anti-Draghi Revolt at ECB Still Won't Die", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picc3a5831696b90484eff020d813e0fea8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
