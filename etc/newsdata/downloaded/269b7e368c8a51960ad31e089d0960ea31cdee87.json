Yet, the study found that most users don't even know what it is.\n\nSimilarly, for 2FA, where companies have been pushing users towards using it for years; yet, users can even barely recognize what a 2FA login process looks like.\n\nIn recent months, Google and Microsoft have both said that enabling even the simplest 2FA solution -- such as SMS-based one-time passcodes -- can protect users against 99.9% of attacks.\n\nThe Pew Research survey shows that these messages have not yet reached most users, and the process of promoting, explaining, and then re-explaining 2FA for end-users must remain a priority for most tech companies and cyber-security practitioners.", "description": "Only 2% of 4,200+ survey takers answered all ten questions correctly in a very basic tech quiz.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/20/9abd7c68-61eb-4638-ac8f-508b39e46b88/thumbnail/770x578/61dc67d5130605751a8bd322fa097d49/istock-incognito.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
