Laura Verheyde\n\nOn the racks in the Camilla & Marc suite hang examples of the brand\u2019s signature tailoring with a twist, including a top and trousers set in burgundy leather and dresses in sunshine yellow and bold prints that have caught the eyes of buyers and press who have visited so far, says designer Camilla Freeman-Topper.\n\nThe best thing about showing in Paris, she says, is not just the opportunity to meet buyers and press from the around the world but the way it validates the brand's direction.\n\nDesign duo Marc Freeman and Camilla Freeman-Topper revel in the \"melting pot\" that is Paris. Laura Verheyde\n\nFor Freeman-Topper\u2019s business partner (and brother) Marc Freeman, Paris during fashion week offers a unique \u201cmelting pot\u201d. \u201cYou can have a meeting with someone from America in the morning and the Middle East in the afternoon. It\u2019s diverse and wonderful to see an accord in what people are liking,\u201d he says.\n\nAt one Camilla and Marc appointment a French buyer described Australians as \u201cexotic\u201d, says Freeman-Topper. A lost-in-translation description perhaps, but what stands is that Australia is \u201can incredible place with an incredible landscape, 24-plus hours away \u2026 and that\u2019s desirable.\u201d\n\nSignature tailoring with a colourful accent from Camilla & Marc. Laura Verheyde\n\nBehind a heavy blue door in the buzzing Marais district is the Catinella PR showroom, where Australian brands showing throughout the Paris season include cool-girl favourite Sir the Label, now stocked by Matchesfashion.com and the New York department store Bergdorf Goodman, and Christopher Esber, whose resort collection at Australia Fashion Week in May caused a buzz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Paris, he\u2019s showing a continuation of this collection, based on the idea of feminine fragility coupled with masculine strength. There\u2019s lovely fine French lace and sharp suiting, lots of greys and tonal shades peppered with buttery yellows.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the collection for resort was going from office to the beach, so a lot of things had strings that represent bikinis and shirts that can unbutton,\u201d says Esber, who celebrates 10 years in the fashion business this year. (\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve had the business for 10 years, it goes so fast.\u201d)\n\nChristopher Esber does greys and neutrals his way. Laura Verheyde\n\nFor the designer, who says 90 per cent of his business comes from international markets with Asia the strongest, a showroom in Paris is the best time for face-to-face time with buyers. \u201cSome designers don\u2019t like being in showroom, but I like being here. It might not be the orthodox thing to do but I like the feedback from buyers,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has travelled to Paris several times a year for the past six years, but it took a while to love the city of lights.\n\nToday, Toni Mati\u010devski's designs are stocked in 120 stores in 30 countries. Laura Verheyde\n\nWhat he likes is the street culture. \u201cWatching people, I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but I love looking at people on the street \u2013 what they\u2019re wearing, how they\u2019re wearing it. It\u2019s great to do that anywhere, but particularly here. People really do a look, particularly the older demographic. You get surprised here, which is nice.\u201d\n\nEight years ago we came to Paris with one appointment. But, you know, we had that one appointment and we were on a high. \u2014 Toni Mati\u010devski\n\nOver in a showroom in the chic 8th arrondissement, Toni Mati\u010devski is surrounded by the beautiful, almost-couture like pieces of his latest collection. Like all of Mati\u010devski\u2019s work, it didn\u2019t start with a particular reference point but a feeling. This time it was like when \u201cyou open a door and feel a soft breeze\u201d, he says.\n\nFor Melbourne-based Mati\u010devski, Paris is \u201calmost like my second home\u201d. He spends up to three weeks in the city four to six times a year, and lived in the 11th arrondissement for just over three years some 20 years back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Mati\u010devski will be \u201cout the back, fitting the models and greeting clients\u201d during a typical showroom season, the process has taught him about resilience and the importance of staying true to your brand and your principles.\n\nHe\u2019s seen enough fashion brands fail to know you have to, as he puts it, \u201cbe selfish in a good way\u201d.\n\n\u201cEight years ago [when the brand re-launched] we came to Paris with one appointment. But, you know, we had that one appointment and one order and we were on a high. We refused to budge on our terms and the way we work.\u201d\n\nMati\u010devski want to keep his brand \"unpredictable in a positive way\". Laura Verheyde\n\nThe brand is now stocked in 120 stores in 30 countries.\n\nAfter 20 years in the business Mati\u010devski says he feels lucky to \u201cbe able to develop my aesthetic in a way that is unique to me \u2013 and to sustain and grow that regardless of what else is happening and what is expected from me\u201d.\n\nAnd yet still his brand surprises people. \u201cMost people come not knowing what to expect, which I find exciting. I want to keep it unpredictable in a positive way.\u201d\n\nOf Australia's fashion reputation, he likes it when people come expecting to see swimwear and find something else entirely.\n\n\u201cWe still get questions [such as] how do they do this out of Australia? It\u2019s kind of: \u2018Who the f--k are these guys?\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cI really like that.\u201d", "description": "The relaxed sophistication of design from Down Under has struck a chord with international buyers at Paris fashion week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2747%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_159/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/15d7e3fd553b0d25b8d5e20e914fbdb0b8802a0e", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
