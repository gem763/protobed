The expert\u2019s tapes of their tense final meetings shed new light on Abbey Road \u2013 and inspired a new stage show\n\nThe Beatles weren\u2019t a group much given to squabbling, says Mark Lewisohn, who probably knows more about them than they knew about themselves. But then he plays me the tape of a meeting held 50 years ago this month \u2013 on 8 September 1969 \u2013 containing a disagreement that sheds new light on their breakup.\n\nThey\u2019ve wrapped up the recording of Abbey Road, which would turn out to be their last studio album, and are awaiting its release in two weeks\u2019 time. Ringo Starr is in hospital, undergoing tests for an intestinal complaint. In his absence, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison convene at Apple\u2019s HQ in Savile Row. John has brought a portable tape recorder. He puts it on the table, switches it on and says: \u201cRingo \u2013 you can\u2019t be here, but this is so you can hear what we\u2019re discussing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Challenging conventional wisdom \u2026 Fab Four writer-historian Mark Lewisohn\n\nWhat they talk about is the plan to make another album \u2013 and perhaps a single for release in time for Christmas, a commercial strategy going back to the earliest days of Beatlemania. \u201cIt\u2019s a revelation,\u201d Lewisohn says. \u201cThe books have always told us that they knew Abbey Road was their last album and they wanted to go out on an artistic high. But no \u2013 they\u2019re discussing the next album. And you think that John is the one who wanted to break them up but, when you hear this, he isn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t that rewrite pretty much everything we thought we knew?\u201d\n\nLewisohn turns the tape back on, and we hear John suggesting that each of them should bring in songs as candidates for the single. He also proposes a new formula for assembling their next album: four songs apiece from Paul, George and himself, and two from Ringo \u2013 \u201cIf he wants them.\u201d John refers to \u201cthe Lennon-and-McCartney myth\u201d, clearly indicating that the authorship of their songs, hitherto presented to the public as a sacrosanct partnership, should at last be individually credited.\n\nThen Paul \u2013 sounding, shall we say, relaxed \u2013 responds to the news that George now has equal standing as a composer with John and himself by muttering something mildly provocative. \u201cI thought until this album that George\u2019s songs weren\u2019t that good,\u201d he says, which is a pretty double-edged compliment since the earlier compositions he\u2019s implicitly disparaging include Taxman and While My Guitar Gently Weeps. There\u2019s a nettled rejoinder from George: \u201cThat\u2019s a matter of taste. All down the line, people have liked my songs.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy\n\nJohn reacts by telling Paul that nobody else in the group \u201cdug\u201d his Maxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer, a song they\u2019ve just recorded for Abbey Road, and that it might be a good idea if he gave songs of that kind \u2013 which, John suggests, he probably didn\u2019t even dig himself \u2013 to outside artists in whom he had an interest, such as Mary Hopkin, the Welsh folk singer. \u201cI recorded it,\u201d a drowsy Paul says, \u201cbecause I liked it.\u201d\n\nA mapping of the tensions that would lead to the dissolution of the most famous and influential pop group in history is part of Hornsey Road, a teasingly titled stage show in which Lewisohn uses tape, film, photographs, new audio mixes of the music and his own matchless fund of anecdotes and memorabilia to tell the story of Abbey Road, that final burst of collective invention.\n\nThe album is now so mythologised that the humdrum zebra crossing featured on its celebrated cover picture is now officially listed as site of special historic interest; a webcam is trained on it 24 hours a day, observing the comings and goings of fans from every corner of the world, infuriating passing motorists as these visitors pause to take selfies, often in groups of four, some going barefoot in imitation of Paul\u2019s enigmatic gesture that August morning in 1969.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest George Harrison and John Lennon recording Let It Be.

The show comes midway through his writing of The Beatles: All These Years, a magnum opus aiming to tell the whole story in its definitive version. The first volume, Tune In, was published six years ago, its mammoth 390,000-word narrative ending just before their first hit. (\u201cAll the heft of the Old Testament,\u201d the Observer\u2019s Kitty Empire wrote, \u201cwith greater forensic rigour.\u201d)\n\nConstant demands to know when Turn On (covering 1963-66) and Drop Out (1967-69) might appear are met with a sigh: \u201cI\u2019m 61, and I\u2019ve got 14 or 15 years left on these books. I\u2019ll be in my mid-70s when I finish.\u201d Time is of the essence, he adds, perhaps thinking of the late John Richardson\u2019s uncompleted multi-volume Picasso biography. This two-hour show is a way of buying the time for him to dive back into the project.\n\nFor 30 years, Lewisohn has been the man to call when you needed to know what any of the Fab Four was doing on almost any day of their lives, and with whom they were doing it. His books include a history of their sessions at what were then known as the EMI Recording Studios in Abbey Road, and he worked on the vast Anthology project in the 90s.\n\nThe idea for a stage show was inspired by an invitation from a university in New Jersey to be the keynote speaker at a three-day symposium on the Beatles\u2019 White Album, then celebrating its golden jubilee. His presentation, called Double Lives, juxtaposed the making of the album and the lives they were leading as individuals outside the studio. \u201cIt took several weeks to put together, and I thought, \u2018This is mad \u2013 I should be doing this more than once to get more people to see it.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney in the studio.

John had released Give Peace a Chance as the Plastic Ono Band and George had been spending time in Woodstock with Bob Dylan.\n\nJohn also took Yoko and their two children, Kyoko and Julian, on a sentimental road trip to childhood haunts in Liverpool, Wales and the north of Scotland, ending when he drove their Austin Maxi into a ditch while trying to avoid another car. Brian Epstein, their manager, had died the previous year and the idealism that had fuelled the founding of their Apple company \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s like a top,\u201d John said. \u201cWe set it going and hope for the best\u201d \u2013 was starting to fray badly. Other business concerns \u2013 such as their song-publishing copyrights, which had been sold without their knowledge \u2013 led to a war between Allen Klein, the hard-boiled New York record industry veteran invited by John to sort it out, and John Eastman, Linda\u2019s father, a top lawyer brought in by Paul to safeguard his interests.\n\nLewisohn has the minutes of another business meeting, this time at Olympic Studios, where the decision to ratify Klein\u2019s appointment was approved by three votes to one (Paul), the first time the Beatles had not spoken with unanimity. \u201cIt was the crack in the Liberty Bell,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt never came back together after that one. Ringo and George just said, whatever John does, we\u2019re going with. I was actually trying, in my mind, to save our future.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Lewisohn challenges the conventional wisdom that 1969 was the year in which they were at each other\u2019s throats, storming out of the recording sessions filmed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg for the verit\u00e9-style movie Let It Be, and barely on speaking terms. During the making of Abbey Road, says Lewisohn, \u201cthey were in an almost entirely positive frame of mind. They had this uncanny ability to leave their problems at the studio door \u2013 not entirely, but almost.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Abbey Road was not the only recording location for the album: earlier sessions were held at Olympic in Barnes and Trident in Soho. And Lewisohn\u2019s creation is called Hornsey Road because that, in other circumstances, is what the album might have been titled, had EMI not abandoned its plans to turn a converted cinema in that rather grittier part of north London into its venue for pop recording.\n\nThe show, Lewisohn believes, is the first time an album has been treated to this format. \u201cPeople will be able to listen with more layers and levels of understanding,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you go to an art gallery, you hope that someone, an expert, will tell you what was happening when the artist painted a particular picture. With these songs, I\u2019m going to show the stories behind them and the people who made them, and what they were going through at the time. Certainly, no one who sees this show will ever hear Abbey Road in the same way again.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Hornsey Road is at the Royal and Derngate, Northampton, on 18 September and touring until 4 December.", "description": "Mark Lewisohn knows the Fab Four better than they knew themselves.
