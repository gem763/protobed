Her explanation sounded too familiar to prosecutors.", "language": "en", "text": "Within minutes, Deputy Lauren Michel found the the 25-year-old woman, Brittany Simek, sitting on a stoop several blocks away. Simek stood up to approach her.\n\nAD\n\nAnd that\u2019s when everything spiraled out of control, leading to criminal charges for Michael, a dire trip to the hospital for Simek \u2014 and a renewed investigation into a separate fatal police shooting for which Michael earned a medal of valor.\n\nAD\n\nOn Wednesday, Michael, 29, was charged with felony first-degree assault and armed criminal action in Simek\u2019s near-fatal shooting after forensic evidence cast serious doubt on the officer\u2019s version of events. Michael had claimed that after she tased Simek in the stomach, the woman managed to gain control of her Taser and zap her in the leg, according to the probable cause statement. Michael claimed she feared the woman would try to grab her gun next \u2015 so she decided to fire.\n\nBut the deputy\u2019s story not only struck investigators as implausible based on the evidence. It was also familiar: It turns out Michael had offered a strikingly similar version of events when explaining why she shot and killed a man in a Walmart parking lot in 2017 while he was resisting arrest.\n\nAD\n\nNow, because of the similarities, the Jackson County prosecuting attorney revealed Thursday that investigators are taking a second look at the Walmart shooting as well.\n\nAD\n\nFor now, Michael has been placed on unpaid leave, the Jackson County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. Attorneys for Michael could not immediately be reached for comment early Friday morning.\n\n\u201cLaws that protect law enforcement\u2019s actions are a high hurdle for prosecutors to overcome. We believe, however, this case will meet that high bar,\u201d Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said in a statement, referring to the scooter incident. \u201cIn this case, we do not find the actions of this officer to be reasonable or lawful. The actions of the deputy were not lawful to effect the arrest of this civilian, and we do not find the officer\u2019s actions to be reasonable to protect against a perceived physical threat against the officer.\"\n\nAD\n\nBy contrast, Michael was rewarded for her actions in the fatal shooting of 31-year-old Donald Sneed III \u2014 an accolade that has disturbed Sneed\u2019s family.\n\nAD\n\nIn May 2017, Michael was working an extra job as a security guard at a Walmart in Raytown, Mo., when she recognized a man caught shoplifting as a wanted suspect with open felony warrants, who had allegedly fled police just a few days earlier.\n\nSo as Sneed exited, Michael and the loss-prevention officer tried to apprehend him. It went badly.\n\nSoon, Michael, the civilian officer and Sneed were wrestling on the pavement in the middle of the parking lot, according to surveillance footage obtained by the Kansas City Star on Thursday. They rolled around and swung their limbs wildly, as the officers couldn\u2019t gain control of Sneed, who was unarmed.\n\nAD\n\nMichael tried to use her Taser on him, according to the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s news release for her medal of valor. She claimed it didn\u2019t work \u2015 and then, she said, Sneed tried to grab the stun gun from her. Just like in the most recent case, Michael claimed Sneed succeeded and stunned her in the face. (The footage does not clearly show what happened.)\n\nAD\n\nSo, Michael took a step back and fired at him multiple times, killing him. The sheriff\u2019s announcement awarding her the medal of valor for killing Sneed during the struggle says nothing of his death.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s using the same storyline. Again. It just makes your blood boil,\u201d Deneta Smashey-Sneed, Sneed\u2019s stepmom, told KCTV News of the most recent case.\n\nAD\n\nSneed\u2019s family, which has already filed a wrongful-death suit against Michael, is calling for charges to be filed in his death also and for Michael to permanently lose her badge. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got another lady shot, and that cop doesn\u2019t even belong on the force,\u201d his father, Donald Sneed Jr., told the Kansas City Star. \u201cShe\u2019s trigger happy and she\u2019s gonna kill more.\u201d\n\nDavid Smith, an attorney for Simek, told KSHB that his client is traumatized. Smith said she was struck four times in the back and buttocks, an experience that has left her \u201cshattered\u201d as she continues to recover.\n\nAD\n\nSimek\u2019s version of events is also supported by evidence, according to court documents.\n\nAD\n\nSimek, a retired U.S. Coast Guard service member, told investigators that while she was sitting on the stoop, Michael got out of her car with her Taser already drawn and told her to get on the ground. \u201cFor what?\u201d Simek asked. Simek said Michael still did not tell her.\n\nMichael\u2019s dash-cam footage captured glimpses of the escalation, even as Michael and Simek remained mostly out of view: Michael, at 11:15 p.m., grabbing Simek by the hair and throwing her to the ground. Simek\u2019s legs, a minute later, twitching uncontrollably, then standing upright and running.\n\nAnd then finally the smoke, seconds later, drifting through the dash-cam\u2019s periphery. That\u2019s when Michael fired at the unarmed woman as she ran away.\n\nAD\n\nShe felt the first bullet pierce her back.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnly a coward shoots a woman in the back and then lies about it,\u201d Smith told KSHB. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened here.\n\nCrime scene investigators with the Kansas City Police Department would soon find five spent .40 caliber cartridge cases and bullet damage to vehicles in the direction that Simek said she ran, evidence that she was shot from behind while fleeing, according to court documents.\n\nThe Taser was also examined, showing that both cartridges were deployed within three seconds \u2014 the key evidence casting doubt on Michael\u2019s claim that Simek stunned her in the leg. \u201cGiven the limited amount of time,\u201d investigators wrote in the probable cause statement, \" this does not support Deputy Michael\u2019s statement that after she tased [Simek], [Simek] fought Deputy Michael for the Taser and then tased Deputy Michael.\"\n\nImmediately after the shooting, when a sergeant arrived on scene, Michael appeared to reference the Sneed case, according to the charging document.\n\nShe told the sergeant, \u201cI am not as comfortable with this one as the last one.\"\n\nAD", "description": "Jackson County Deputy Lauren Michael told a similar story the last time she fatally shot someone in a Walmart parking lot, and now that shooting is under review too, prosecutors said.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qOV1SKahqV9z2apkpLZcxoyN03k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25DPDB34QFABVKOMBRBHKEK3WA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
