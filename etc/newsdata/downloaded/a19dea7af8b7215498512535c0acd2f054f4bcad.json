Slogging around the 70km course is an achievement for anyone, but Somers Eve carried 45kg on his back, a kilogram for everyone one his father lost to cancer before his death.\n\nSomers Eve had no running experience, let along mountain ultrarunning. In 10 months, he has been transformed by the support of the trail running community, to the point where he was able to haul \u201cthe weight of a small human\u201d over Lantau Peak and beyond.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot more emotional than I imagined,\u201d he said. \u201cThe support I had wandering around was a game changer. They kept me on the straight and narrow, they kept me moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThroughout the process, I\u2019m just humbled by the support and generosity, even from people I\u2019ve never met,\u201d Somers Eve said. \u201cEveryone one, from Trail Hub [the race organisers] for promoting it, to people I\u2019d only met once. It is so amazing to see this incredible trail running community.\u201d\n\nSomers Eve father died last year, just six months after diagnosis. Somers Eve has raised over HK$140,700 for the charity, Macmillan Cancer Support, who were \u201cunbelievable\u201d during his family\u2019s ordeal.\n\n\u201cThere was the emotion of why I was doing it. That was present throughout,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there was the emotion of just getting around and all the grunt work I\u2019d done.\u201d\n\n\u201cLantau Peak was longer than I remember,\u201d Somers Eve said. \u201cThen the hill after Big Buddha had me throwing up. I was in a dark, dark place, knowing I had so much to go. And then the final 10km just never ended. The pain was all-encompassing.\u201d\n\nSomers Eve works for Swire Properties, and is originally from the UK.\n\nHis mother surprised him at one of the checkpoints, and was waiting at the finish line, where he \u201cshed a tear\u201d. Somers Eve was joined throughout the course by his friends, egging him on.\n\n\u201cI had to remind myself it was about completing the challenge, not getting an awesome time,\u201d Somers Eve said. \u201cBut sometimes you need that external reminder that you\u2019ve done the training, and you\u2019re OK.\u201d\n\nHe hopes that beyond the money he raised, he can inspire others to \u201cdo something half as stupid as this if they are in a hard place too\u201d.\n\nYou can donate to Somers Eve\u2019s cause here.", "description": "James Somers Eve finishes the mountain race on Lantau in 21 hours with the support of his friends and a surprise visit from his mother", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/28/f7f0c260-f95a-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15_image_hires_173012.JPG?itok=BCsmacvM&v=1572255023", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
