No festive lights? 40 years in prison.\n\nSure, it might kill the fun if people are acting jolly because they fear imprisonment but it\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year\u2122, why do we only get to experience it for a few short weeks? Absolutely ludicrous, if you ask this hypothetical politician.\n\nBecause of my undying love for the holidays, I often find myself sitting there in the middle of July, powering through Christmas movies while my housemate weakly attempts to hide their disgust. Some say the look of disgust is unrelated and more about me as a person in general, but I know deep down that it\u2019s because I\u2019m watching an \u201cout-of-season\u201d film.\n\nThe point is, the masses seem to judge us anti-Scrooges when we dare to watch holiday movies when it\u2019s not technically the right season, keep our trees up past the grace period, or say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2018 to strangers on the street in March.\n\nShame. Shame on everyone who chastises someone for simply being spirited. There are countless Christmas movies out there deserving of rewatches any day of the year and I\u2019m taking a stand: watch what you want, when you want. Don\u2019t listen to the Bah Humbuggers of the world.\n\nSo, here are a few deadset classics along with my reasoning as to why they don\u2019t deserve to be shelved for nine months of the year. Fair warning, my reasoning is sound so prepare to be convinced.\n\nA CHRISTMAS CAROL (2009)\n\nThe story of a rich, heartless man who gets scared into being a semi-decent person is a classic \u2013 Christmas-themed or not. It taught me that no matter how cold and unapproachable an elderly person may be, if you dress up as a ghost and taunt them for a long enough period of time, they\u2019ll eventually learn to be better.\n\nPlus, this is the only movie where you\u2019ll see a 3D Jim Carrey, so go ahead and show me a non-Christmas movie which offers the same viewing experience. I\u2019ll be patiently waiting in my reindeer sweater.\n\nTHE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (1993)\n\nArguably not even a Christmas movie (it is, it 100% is), The Nightmare Before Christmas ticks all the boxes.\n\nMoody Halloween setting? Check. Death? Check. Cracking tunes? Check. Romance? Check. Tim Burton? Check. Cute puppy sidekick? Check.\n\nQuite literally everything you ever want to see in a movie is in The Nightmare Before Christmas but no, feel free to deprive yourself of this delight in April because it\u2019s not \u2018Christmas season\u2019.\n\nTHE SANTA CLAUSE (1994)\n\nI\u2019m a sucker for a Freaky Friday-esque plotline and The Santa Clause more than delivers, except instead of a teenage girl and her mum you\u2019ve got Santa and a dad.\n\nIn essence, The Santa Clause is really a tale of a dad trying to connect with his son and if you can\u2019t relate to that outside of December, all hope is lost.\n\nI\u2019LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS (1998)\n\nPlot: a young man is left stranded in the desert without any money and has to race against the clock to reach his family before\u2026well\u2026Santa comes.\n\nLook, as far as Christmas movies go, this one\u2019s a nailbiter. Who, may I ask, doesn\u2019t love a good nailbiter of a flick? No one I personally want to know.\n\nI could go on (and part of me thinks I should) but I believe I\u2019ve presented a flawless argument with supporting evidence as to why a) Christmas movies are designed to be enjoyed all year round and b) I would make an A+ leader of Australia.\n\nChoose me, or the fire.", "description": "The masses seem to judge us anti-Scrooges when we dare to watch Christmas movies when it's not technically the right season, and that needs to stop.", "authors": ["Louis Costello"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/06/santaclause.jpg"}
