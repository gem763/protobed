REUTERS/Jonathan Crosby/File Photo\n\nSo far, signals are mixed. While traders are betting heavily on what would be a third rate cut this year at the Fed\u2019s Oct. 29-30 meeting, it is unclear whether Fed policymakers overall will support such a move. In September, the median of the Fed\u2019s 17 policymakers thought just two rate cuts in 2019 would be appropriate.\n\nSince that meeting, jobs growth has slowed and retail sales unexpectedly dropped, possible signals that a decline in manufacturing brought on by the U.S.-China trade war may be spreading more broadly through the economy.\n\nAt the same time, household debt levels remain low and consumer spending is still on pace to grow by 2.5% this year, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Friday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any evidence right now that recession risks are elevated,\u201d Clarida, the Fed\u2019s No. 2 official said at an event in Boston. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see that spilling into the consumer.\u201d\n\nHis speech echoed that of Fed Chair Jerome Powell two weeks ago that was seen as signaling another interest rate cut at the central bank\u2019s next meeting. It was also in line with those of other policymakers who emphasized this week that they are open minded about future policy decisions.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in July. It did so again at its subsequent policy meeting in September in what Powell and some others have characterized as \u201cinsurance\u201d against headwinds to the economy from slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nSince the meeting, U.S. manufacturing activity tumbled to a more than 10-year low and service sector activity fell to a three-year low in September.\n\nBut consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two thirds of U.S. activity, remains key as policymakers weigh whether more cuts are needed. U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September, data on Wednesday showed.\n\n\u201cI think the data has come in since the last meeting generally softer; generally it\u2019s been a little bit more downside than I would have expected at the September meeting,\u201d Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said in Des Moines on Friday.\n\nWith the Fed\u2019s policy target range for overnight rates of 1.75%-2.00% currently above the yield on the 10-year Treasury, interest rates may be restraining the economy when in his view they ought to be \u201csomewhat accommodative,\u201d given the risks, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudge what the committee will do, but I think we are all trying to be data dependent, and as the data moves, I think our outlooks tend to adjust,\u201d Kashkari said.\n\nDallas Federal Reserve bank president Robert Kaplan said at an event in Washington that he is currently \u201cagnostic\u201d about a third rate in October.\n\n\u201cThis could break either way,\u201d said Kaplan, who like Kashkari is not a voter on Fed policy this year. Despite risks tilted toward a worse-than-expected economic outcome, \u201cit may be wise to take a little time to assess and continue to turn over a few more cards.\u201d\n\nKansas City Fed President Esther George, who has dissented from both rate cuts this year, signaled she would again argue against reducing borrowing cuts at the Fed\u2019s next meeting.\n\n\u201cMy own outlook for the economy does not call for a monetary policy response,\u201d George said. \u201cWhile weakness in manufacturing and business investment is evident, it is not clear that monetary policy is the appropriate tool to offset the risks faced by businesses in those sectors when weighted against the costs that could be associated with such action.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe only data that would change her view would be something showing U.S. consumers really beginning to suffer from the effects of trade uncertainty and slowing growth.\n\n\u201cShould downside risks spill over...in a way that fundamentally affects the consumer and shifts the overall outlook, a monetary policy response may be required,\u201d George said.", "description": "In their last public comments before the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate decision, U.S. central bankers on Friday left the door open to a further reduction in borrowing costs as they continue to assess how household spending, the main driver of U.S. economic growth, is holding up.", "authors": ["Jonnelle Marte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442358718&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1OV", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
