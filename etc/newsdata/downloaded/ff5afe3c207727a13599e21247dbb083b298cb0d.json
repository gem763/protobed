Data on Friday showed that U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in August. That came after better-than-expected producer price inflation data on Wednesday and consumer price data on Thursday.\n\nThe Bank of Japan is also due to meet this week. Some believe the central bank may push interest rates further into negative territory and ramp up stimulating policies.\n\nSino-U.S. trade developments also remained under the spotlight as junior U.S. and Chinese officials will reportedly meet this week ahead of planned talks between senior trade negotiators in October.\n\nTensions between the two sides eased somewhat in recent weeks after Beijing exempted some agricultural products from additional tariffs on U.S. goods last week and U.S. President Donald Trump postponed a tariff increase on a range of Chinese goods by two weeks.\n\nThe USD/CNY pair slipped 0.1% to 7.0717. The AUD/USD pair edged down 0.1% to 0.6872, while the NZD/USD pair gained 0.2% to 0.6381.", "description": "Forex - Japanese Yen Rises Amid Heightened Geopolitical Tensions in Middle East", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC37002_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
