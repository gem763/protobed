Gordon Sondland, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, responds to Taylor, saying that charge is \"incorrect.\"\n\n(MORE: Live updates: Trump says Ukraine, China should investigate Bidens as former envoy testifies)\n\n\"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelenskiy promised during his campaign,\" Sondland says.\n\nSondland then suggests to the group take the conversations off line, typing, \u201cI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the material obtained by ABC News included the full exchange.\n\nVolker Texts on Ukraine Shared With Congress by ABC News Politics on Scribd\n\nSondland, a hotelier and Republican megadonor, contributed over $1 million to the president\u2019s inaugural committee before eventually being nominated and confirmed to be the United States representative to the European Union, serving since July 2018. He has assisted the effort by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to contact Ukrainian officials about an investigation, according to Giuliani, who says he briefed Sondland and Volker after his meetings.\n\nIn a July 25 call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, President Trump asked the new president to work with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, prompting an impeachment inquiry in the House.\n\n(MORE: Kurt Volker resigns as US special envoy to Ukraine)\n\nVolker resigned last Friday as the special envoy for Ukraine. The State Department has previously confirmed that Volker put Giuliani in touch with Zelenskiy's aides at their request, but did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nThe texts came just days before the White House released the military assistance to Ukraine -- almost $400 million from the State Department and Pentagon meant to boost the U.S. partner against Russian aggression. That aid was ordered withheld by the White House a week before the call, according to a senior administration official.\n\nPHOTO: Ambassador William Taylor holds a news conference in Kyiv, capital of Ukraine, June 25, 2019. (Avalon.red via Newscom, FILE) More\n\nIn a separate thread between Sondland and Volker directly, the two diplomats discussed contacts with Ukrainian officials and requests for them to open an investigation. On Aug. 13, they appear to be drafting language for Ukrainian officials to announce an investigation into \"the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States, especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians.\"\n\n\"I want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future,\" Volker writes, with Sondland responding, \"Perfect. Lets send to Andrey after our call.\"\n\n\"Andrey\" is an apparent reference to Zelenskiy's aide Andrey Yermak, with whom Volker had put Giuliani in contact.", "description": "The exchange, provided by another American diplomat, former U.S Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, as part of his closed-door deposition before multiple House committees Thursday, shows what appears to be encrypted text messages he exchanged with two other American diplomats in September regarding", "authors": ["Katherine Faulders", "Conor Finnegan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mvVMHG0ESfRg3yfQakg1kw--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/william-taylor-nc-ps-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
