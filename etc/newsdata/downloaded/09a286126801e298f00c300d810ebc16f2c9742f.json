The most recent vote, a 6-0 decision, ruled the two had moved into the district for athletic purposes, the Morning News reported.\n\nBriles and Mount Vernon received a public reprimand, but no forfeitures were handed down by the committee, Mount Vernon ISD Superintendent Jason McCullough told The Dallas Morning News in a statement.\n\nDespite this, the official rule of the UIL states that \"In the event an ineligible contestant is used in any League game or contest, knowingly or unknowingly, the minimum penalty shall be forfeiture of the game, contest or event.\"\n\nIt is unknown how many games Brock and Cameron Nellor have played in, but Briles has led Mount Vernon to a 5-0 record and 1-0 start in District 7-3A Div. I.\n\nMount Vernon was the first football program in the United States to hire Briles after he was fired from Baylor following a sexual assault scandal at the school.

That report said football staff members conducted inquiries into sexual assaults by players and did not report them to administration, and that school administrators also encouraged victims to not report complaints.\n\nBriles received a $15.1 million settlement from Baylor and denies any wrongdoing. Briles had coached at Baylor from 2008 to 2015, going 65-37 and winning two Big 12 titles.\n\nThe Morning News reported Mount Vernon plans on appealing the decision with the UIL, citing the earlier vote as a possible exception to the current ruling.\n\n\"We are disappointed by and disagree with the sudden reversal of field by the District 7-AAA Executive Committee but respect its decision,\" McCullough said in a statement. \"Facts presented at a previous meeting on this topic resulted in the exoneration of the two students and validation of their athletic eligibility.\n\n\"The DEC (Tuesday) voted 6-0 that the two students moved to our school district for athletic purposes as defined by U.I.L. rules, despite what we believe to be overwhelming evidence that the parents moved from Colorado for employment reasons. The DEC also voted 6-0 that Mt. Vernon ISD used a coach not employed by the district in violation of UIL rules. It then voted 6-0 to give Mt. Vernon a public reprimand for allowing a coach on the field who was not employed by the school.\"\n\n\"Mount Vernon will contact the UIL (Wednesday) to begin the appeal process. We feel confident that once the facts are reviewed by the State Executive Committee, the decision to punish the two students will be overturned.\"", "description": "A Tuesday ruling said the Texas high school team coached by Art Briles could be forced to forfeit up to five games due to usage of ineligible players.", "authors": ["Peter L.
