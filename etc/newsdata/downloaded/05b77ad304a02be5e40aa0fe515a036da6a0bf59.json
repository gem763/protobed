But the winning images from the London Natural History Museum\u2019s annual Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition give rare glimpses of animals\u2019 resilience.\n\nThis year, the photographers behind these pictures climbed coastal cliffs in Norway, trekked through the jungles of Costa Rica, and dove deep into the waters of Indonesia to observe animals\u2019 struggles to survive and get a decent meal.\n\nPhotographers from 100 countries submitted 48,000 entries for the contest, including photos of an interlocked ant army, a stand-off between a surly fox and a shocked marmot, and a puma ambushing a guanaco.\n\nRead More: The best wildlife photos taken this year reveal a hippo murder, a hungry leopard seal, and a weevil ensnared by zombie fungus\n\nThe Natural History Museum announced the various winners at an awards ceremony on Tuesday; the photos will be on display at the museum starting October 18.\n\nHere are 14 of the winners from this year\u2019s contest.\n\nIt took photographer Audun Rikardsen three years to capture this shot of a golden eagle. The birds have impressive wing spans of up to 6.5 feet.\n\ncaption In this photograph, which took gold in the \u201cBehavior\u201d category for birds, a golden eagle lands on a tree branch in Norway. source Audun Rikardsen/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nThough golden eagles weigh no more than an average house cat, their curved and razor-sharp talons help them hunt animals as big as reindeer.\n\nAfter finding a tree high on a ledge overlooking the northern coast of Norway, Rikardsen bolted down a camera and tripod onto a sturdy branch. By occasionally leaving carrion nearby, Rikardsen helped acclimate nearby golden eagles to the camera\u2019s presence. The eagles started using the camera-laden branch to scout out prey.\n\nGerman photographer Ingo Arndt also spent a long time \u2014 seven months \u2014 tracking wild pumas on foot in the Torres del Paine region of Patagonia, Chile, before he got this shot of a female puma attacking a guanaco (a fuzzy llama relative).\n\ncaption Ingo Arndt\u2019s photo of a female puma attacking a guanaco in Patagonia, Chile won gold in the mammals \u201cBehavior\u201d category. source Ingo Arndt/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nAccording to Arndt, the puma eventually got used to his presence, so was not bothered by his attempts to capture her on camera. But to record her stalking and killing prey, the photographer had to pick a potential target \u2013 this guanaco grazing apart from his herd \u2013 then position himself downwind, facing the direction the puma would likely come from.\n\nArndt said the predator spent half an hour angling towards the guanaco before springing. In the end, she wasn\u2019t able to mount the male guanaco\u2019s back to deliver the killing bite before he shook her off and escaped.\n\nOther times, the predator has better luck. In this picture \u2014 which earned photographer Yongqing Bao the award for Wildlife Photographer of the Year \u2014 the shocked face of an unsuspecting marmot is captured in perfect clarity as it faces a hungry fox.\n\ncaption Yongqing Bao won the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2019 title for this image, titled \u201cThe Moment.\u201d source Yongqing Bao/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nThe picture also won the top prize in the contest\u2019s mammals \u201cBehavior\u201d category. Bao took it while in China\u2019s Qilian Mountains National Nature Reserve.\n\nHe said the marmot had spotted the fox an hour earlier and sounded the alarm to the rest of its 30-member colony in the burrow below, then dashed underground. But the marmot was hungry after a long winter of hibernating, so it eventually popped back out; the fox had been waiting patiently.\n\nBut not every search for sustenance involves a fight. This snapshot, which earned Thomas Easterbrook top honors in the 10 years and under photographer category, shows a hummingbird hawk-moth mid-slurp.\n\ncaption A hummingbird hawk-moth hovers in front of an autumn sage flower in the French countryside.

The insect can beat its wings 70 times per second.\n\nStill, finding food can require braving the elements. This image from photographer Max Waugh shows an American bison weathering a winter whiteout in Wyoming\u2019s Yellowstone National Park.\n\ncaption This photo from Max Waugh won the contest\u2019s black-and-white category. source Max Waugh/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nWinters in Yellowstone often reach sub-zero temperatures. In this photo, a bison uses its huge head to dig through heavy snow in order to reach the grass underneath. (Waugh was toasty warm in his car when he took the picture.)\n\nEven colder than Yellowstone winters, though, are Arctic ones. Here, a photo by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Villet shows two male Dall\u2019s sheep competing for mating rights on a minus-40-degree day in Yukon, Canada.\n\ncaption Two male Dall\u2019s sheep in winter-white coats stand in a fierce clash on a snowy slope in Yukon, Canada. The image earned Villet the award for \u201cRising Star portfolio.\u201d source J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Villet/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nVillet spent a month following Dall\u2019s sheep around the Yukon in a rental van, trying to capture them rutting. To get this action shot, Villet had to lie in the snow. He said this blizzard was so cold that he got frostbite on his fingers while trying to operate the camera.\n\nChiru antelopes like the ones in this photo are also adept at surviving in cold weather. Photographer Shangzhen Fan\u2019s image of them won the top prize in the contest\u2019s \u201cAnimals in their Environment\u201d category.\n\ncaption In this photo by Shangzhen Fan, a small herd of male Chiru leaves a trail of footprints on a snow-veiled slope in the Kumukuli Desert of China\u2019s Altun Shan National Nature Reserve. source Shangzhen Fan/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nThanks to their unique underfur, called shahtoosh (Persian for \u201cking of wools\u201d), the animals can survive temperatures as cold as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius). They are found only on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at elevations of 18,000 feet.\n\nBut the desirable nature of that fur led Chiru to get hunted almost to extinction in the 1980s and 1990s. The population dropped from 1 million to less than 70,000 individuals.\n\nPenguins are some of the most masterful cold-environment dwellers. Photographer Stefan Christmann\u2019s image shows male emperor penguins snuggling together to share and conserve body heat.\n\ncaption More than 5,000 male emperor penguins huddle against the wind and cold on the sea ice of Antarctica\u2019s Atka Bay. The photo won the contest\u2019s \u201cPortfolio Award.\u201d source Stefan Christmann/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nMales emperor penguins hold their mate\u2019s egg under a fold of skin between their feet while the females head to the sea, where they feed for up to three months. The penguins must keep themselves and their eggs safe in temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius).\n\nPhysical adaptations \u2013 including body fat and several layers of scale-like feathers \u2013 help the males endure the cold, but the animals\u2019 ultimate survival depends on cooperation.\n\nTo keep their progeny safe, Ethiopian gelada monkeys like to cluster on cliff ledges to sleep. Infants typically cling to their mother\u2019s belly, as seen in this picture by teenage photographer Riccardo Marchgiani.\n\ncaption A female gelada with a week-old infant clinging to her climbs over the cliff edge in Ethiopia\u2019s Simien Mountains National Park. source Riccardo Marchegiani/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nMarchgiani traveled to a high plateau in Ethiopia\u2019s Simien Mountains National Park with his father and a friend to see geladas. Around dawn, after an hour\u2019s wait, he snapped this photo of a female climbing up from her group\u2019s sleeping ledge. The image earned him the top prize in the 15- to 17-year old photographer category.\n\nMany animals migrate in order to give birth to and raise their offspring. This image shows the mass migration of common frogs in South Tyrol, Italy.\n\ncaption Photographer Manuel Plaickner\u2019s image of migrating common frogs in South Tyrol, Italy earned top honors in the contest\u2019s amphibians \u201cBehavior\u201d category. source Manuel Plaickner/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nEvery spring in southern Italy, rising temperatures stir frogs to emerge from the sheltered spots where they spend the winter. They migrate to water ponds to spawn. Photographer Manuel Plaickner found one of these ponds, then immersed himself and his camera and waited for the right moment.\n\nA female frog can lay up to 2,000 eggs at a time; a male then fertilizes them in the water.\n\nTo capture shy underwater creatures, photographers often need to get creative. For this image, David Doubilet placed his camera in a spot where he knew a a colony of garden eels lived, then hid behind the remnants of a shipwreck.\n\ncaption By capturing this colony of garden eels on the sea floor near Dauin, Philippines, photographer David Doubilet won gold in the underwater category. source David Doubilet/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nDoubilet waited for an opportunity to remote-trigger his camera system using a 40-foot extension cord. After several hours, the garden eels rose from their sandy burrows to feed on plankton drifting by in the current, their snake-like bodies undulating in the undersea waves.\n\nOnce a small wrasse and slender cornetfish joined the tableau, Doubilet took his shot.\n\nFourteen-year-old Cruz Erdmann didn\u2019t need to hide to snag a picture of this glow-in-the-dark big fin reef squid. The photo earned him the title of Youth Photographer of the Year.\n\ncaption Cruz Erdmann took the award for Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year with his portrait of an iridescent big fin reef squid. source Cruz Erdmann/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nErdmann took part in an organized night dive in the Lembeh Strait off North Sulawesi, Indonesia. He encountered a pair of mating big fin reef squid; although one jetted away, the other hovered long enough for Cruz to capture its glowing underwater show.\n\nMost wildlife photographers understand the need to seize fleeting moments. Animals like this crab spider, which photographer Ripan Biswas shot in West Bengal, India, don\u2019t generally pose for portraits.\n\ncaption A crab spider poses for photographer Ripan Biswas in India\u2019s Buxa Tiger Reserve. This shot earned Biswas the top prize in the \u201cAnimal Portraits\u201d category. source Ripan Biswas/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nBiswas noticed the spider cavorting about a red weaver ant colony in the subtropical forest of India\u2019s Buxa Tiger Reserve. The arachnid is just half-an-inch long and mimics ants in appearance, behavior, and smell. That allows it to infiltrate a colony and take advantage of the easily accessible prey.\n\nThis particular spider was hunting when Biswas edged his camera in for a close up. The lens got so close that the spider likely saw its own fanged reflection and raised its legs as a warning.\n\nAnts, meanwhile, can be easier to photograph than spiders \u2014 if a bunch of them join together. Photographer Daniel Kronauer tracked a colony of nomadic army ants to get this shot.\n\ncaption In the Costa Rican rainforest, a horde of army ants interlock their bodies to form a nest. This photo snagged top honors in the invertebrate \u201cBehavior\u201d category. source Daniel Kronauer/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nThe army ants were traveling through the Costa Rican rainforest. After the sun set, they would interlock their bodies to build a new nest to house the queen and larvae. The ants formed a scaffold of vertical chains by interlocking the claws on their feet.\n\nThe shape of these living nests depend on the ants\u2019 surroundings. One night, the colony assembled in the open, against a fallen branch and two large leaves that were evenly spaced and of similar height.\n\nThe resulting nest spanned 20 inches and resembled \u201ca living cathedral with three naves,\u201d Kronauer said.", "description": "Business Insider - The winners of the 2019 Wildlife Photographer of the Year contest showcase animals' struggle to survive in harsh conditions and get a decent meal..
