It paves the way to introduce a bill that is designed to block a no-deal Brexit by forcing the prime minister to request an extension if he cannot strike a reworked divorce agreement with the rest of the EU.\n\nJohnson walked into parliament on Tuesday with a majority of one, which he lost even before the vote when the Conservative MP Phillip Lee defected from the party and crossed the floor to join the Liberal Democrats.\n\nJohnson threatened his MPs ahead of Tuesday that they should vote with him or face the penalty of having the \u201cwhip\u201d withdrawn. Despite this threat, Johnson lost the vote. The rebel MPs and opposition parties won by 328 to 301.\n\nBoris Johnson to seek election after rebel Tories deliver Commons defeat Read more\n\nWhat does it mean to \u2018withdraw the whip\u2019?\n\nAn arcane and slightly disturbing expression, in political-speak \u201cwithdrawing the whip\u201d from someone effectively means booting them out of the party, without them immediately losing their seat.\n\nAn MP who has the whip withdrawn sits as an independent, but can be brought back into the party fold if it decides to restore the whip. Having the whip withdrawn is one of the most serious disciplinary actions that can be taken against an MP by a party. In this case it may mean they are barred from standing for the Tories in the next election.\n\n\u201cWhips\u201d are people who ensure their party members show up and vote along party lines. But the whip also refers to a circular letter sent to MPs and Lords of each party telling them about parliamentary business and how they should vote on it. A particularly important vote is underlined three times, which is why it is referred to as a \u201cthree-line whip\u201d.\n\nAmong those who had the whip withdrawn on Tuesday are Sir Nicholas Soames, a former minister and grandson of Winston Churchill; the previous chancellor, Philip Hammond; and the former minister David Gauke. The chairman of the Conservative party, James Cleverly, defended the decision, saying it was a \u201cvery long-standing convention\u201d that MPs who vote \u201cto remove executive power from their own government\u201d have the whip removed.\n\nJames Cleverly MP (@JamesCleverly) It is a very long-standing convention that an MP who votes to remove executive power from their own government and hand it to the opposition has the party whip removed.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nBoris Johnson has announced he will ask parliament to allow a snap general election, which would be held on 15 October. The date of 14 October had been floated, but was deemed inappropriate as it is the Jewish holiday Sukkot.\n\nJohnson has said that even if the rebels\u2019 vote passes on Wednesday he will never request an extension beyond 31 October from the EU, and \u201cthe people of this country will have to choose\u201d in an election. However, the prime minister needs a two-thirds majority to secure an early general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Which means Labour can block it \u2013 and Jeremy Corbyn quickly made clear his party would not vote for an election unless and until the anti-no-deal bill has passed.\n\nThere is talk that if things reach a stalemate, it could result in a motion of no confidence in Johnson, but the prospects of that remain unclear.", "description": "Boris Johnson has been defeated in parliament over Brexit by a rebellion of his own MPs", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1f027eff2ee681378618e840af95057c349e1c/0_120_7778_4669/master/7778.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b4235ad44205785cdb08e8fa62f0dac"}
