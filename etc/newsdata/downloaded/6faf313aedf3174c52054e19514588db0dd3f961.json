Our hosts, Melanie and Darleen, talk viewers through the purchases and product roundups that are the hottest on the market right now, from the viral Amazon coat to the best beauty dupes.\n\nThis is Amazon's best-selling and much raved about coat \u2013 we tested it out to see for ourselves if it was worth the affordable price or if you should splurge on a more expensive, traditional coat. See what we thought in the video above and learn more about this cult-favorite below!\n\nThere's a very good chance that last winter you either saw the Orolay Down Jacket on your friends, family members or fellow commuters. After gaining traction among the women of Manhattan's Upper East Side, this winter jacket blew up with everyone from bloggers to teachers to fashion editors rocking the affordable style. We think everyone fell head over heels for this product for a few reasons, including its neutral color, flattering length, eye-catching stitching and accessibility (thank you Amazon Prime!).\n\nHowever, we are obsessed with this coat for its chic zipper accents, black ribbon tassels, super cozy hood (the sherpa material is ridiculously soft) and wallet-friendly price tag. Retailing for just $140, this jacket is a total steal compared to a ton of other options out on the market that are several hundred dollars, making it perfect for those looking to get a great coat at an affordable price.\n\nPlus, the Orolay Down Jacket comes in six different colors including beige, black, gray, green (pictured above), navy and, our personal favorite, red, so you can be sure to find a hue that is just your style. And since the coat is filled with 90 percent white duck down and 10 percent feathers, you can be sure that it'll keep you nice and toasty all winter long.\n\nShop more fall fashion below:", "description": "This lightly puffy, anorak-inspired jacket blew up with everyone from bloggers to fashion editors rocking the affordable style.", "authors": ["Julia Webb"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UzMmgxMJABFtBxjum3NgMw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2676x1754+255+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/43e0c5f0-eac2-11e9-ad2e-5267a860779e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
