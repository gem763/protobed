(Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nBryce Harper finally had it. The former Washington National has occasionally toyed with Nationals Park fans since he departed this offseason, and he has endured the loudest boos Nationals faithful have offered this season before nearly every at-bat. But on Wednesday night, toward the end of his Philadelphia Phillies\u2019 fifth straight loss, he broke.\n\nHarper was standing in right field during the eighth inning when the crowd got to him. He pointed his right thumb toward the back of his jersey. He waved off the Nationals fans\u2019 words like mosquitoes. He declined to reveal afterward what was said, but he said it crossed a line.\n\n[Svrluga: Playoff-clinching win was perfect bookend to the Bryce Harper chapter in Nationals history]\n\n\u201cThey were fine all game, talking about myself and things like that,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI get it everywhere I go. That\u2019s nothing new. But the last two innings, it\u2019s just not right. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the vitriol from Nationals fans, but he chalked it up to how things are \u201cnowadays.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I said the whole time, I\u2019ve got 60,000 fans up in Philly that appreciate [me] as a player, appreciate me as an individual and my family as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI owe a lot to those people up there in Philly, because they show up for me every single night and they\u2019re there to cheer us on and boo us and keep us going as a team and as individuals as well. I\u2019m looking forward to the next 12 years. Can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether there will always be a heightened atmosphere playing in the District, Harper demurred. He said things have always been this way, crowds have always picked on him, while maintaining, \u201cI just want to play.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, there\u2019s been times I haven\u2019t ran out baseballs or things like that, slacked and things, but that\u2019s part of it,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single night, I come out here. My team deserves that. My city, Philadelphia, deserves that.\u201d\n\nHarper understood that heckling is part of sports, and he said he doesn\u2019t usually listen, but he saw this as a microcosm of a larger issue.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a platform now \u2014 Twitter, Instagram, in the stands, things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can kind of say whatever they want, and that\u2019s just how it is. You just have to live with it.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nNationals, perhaps a little hung over, keep on keeping on in quest for home field\n\nNats GM Mike Rizzo credits Dave Martinez, \u2018special group\u2019 for playoff berth\n\nBoswell: The Nats earned their spot in the postseason, but they still have unfinished business", "description": "The ex-Nat expressed his displeasure with remarks from fans that he acknowledged crossed a line.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/g9ZenVUuHXcROZPmwDGg_UAOT00=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YSYJKDHAAQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
