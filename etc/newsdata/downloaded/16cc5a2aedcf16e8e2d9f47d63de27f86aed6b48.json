Fortunately, Australian creators are getting a little help in this regard thanks to the National Film and Sound Archive, which has announced that has begun the process of archiving all Australian games.\n\nEight Australian games have been nominated for preservation to begin with, ranging from the mobile narrative Florence, Team Cherry's Hollow Knight, and stretching all the way back to cassette tape games and one of the earliest games to be banned in Australia. The archiving is tied into the NFSA's hosting of Game Masters, an exhibition celebrating the medium of video games that will run for six months from tomorrow.\n\nThe National Film And Sound Archive Is Holding A Video Game Exhibition The National Library has no problem adding Call of Cthulhu games to their collection, so it seems only right that video games should get pride of place somewhere in Canberra.

Preserving the games will also be a learning process for the national body, highlighting the difficulties around preserving modern games, long-term storage solutions for older mediums like cartridges, issues of copyright and expired licenses.\n\nOnce the initial eight games have been successfully archived, the NFSA will begin archiving other Australian games \"on an ongoing basis\". \"We look forward to working with them as we develop solutions for long-term preservation of their work, for the benefit of future generations,\" M\u00fcller said.", "description": "As games become ever more tied to an online environment, the industry is struggling to find ways to properly archive and preserve the medium's incredible history.
