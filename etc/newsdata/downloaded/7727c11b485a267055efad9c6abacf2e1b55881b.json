The New York-based bank estimated that there has been a maximum outflow of Hong Kong dollar deposits totaling $3 billion to $4 billion to Singapore, an alternative financial center for the region, as of August.\n\nLocal-currency deposits declined in August by 1.6% from the previous month, the biggest drop in more than a year, to about HK$6.84 trillion ($873 billion), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said earlier this week. Its chief attributed that slump to a dearth of initial public offerings and said there\u2019s been a slight increase in the first three weeks of September. That was before a further escalation in violence in the city.\n\n\u201cWe found modest net outflow from HKD deposits in Hong Kong and modest net inflow of FX deposits in Singapore,\u201d analysts Gurpreet Singh Sahi and Yingqiang Guo wrote in a note to investors late Monday. \u201cWe believe the debate on Hong Kong outflow/liquidity will remain active and the data points for September (and beyond) critical in shaping the same.\u201d\n\nForeign-currency deposits at both domestic and international banks operating in Singapore rose to a record S$12.8 billion ($9.3 billion) as of August, according to Monetary Authority of Singapore preliminary data. The bulk of the increase took place in July and August, when the figure rose S$5 billion in total, a 64% increase in two months, the data show.\n\nHong Kong police groups are urging the city to impose curfews and invoke other powers under a controversial colonial era-emergency law, as Chief Executive Carrie Lam struggles to control escalating unrest. Waves of rallies across Hong Kong led to widespread clashes between protesters and police on the National Day holiday Tuesday, with an officer shooting and wounding a demonstrator for the first time since unrest began almost four months ago.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s powerful Public Order Ordinance, passed during a wave of riots in 1967, lets the government establish curfews and close areas from public access. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance of 1922 goes further, allowing the chief executive to make \u201cany regulations whatsoever\u201d to ensure public security, including censorship, snap arrests and property searches and seizures. That ordinance hasn\u2019t been used in more than a half century.\n\n(Updates with Singapore data in fifth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Chanyaporn Chanjaroen.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alfred Liu in Hong Kong at aliu226@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, Daniel Taub, Sam Mamudi\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The potential benefit to Singapore from the turmoil in Hong Kong: $4 billion.That\u2019s the upper end of an estimate from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. of the money investors have moved to Singapore amid escalating political protests in the former British colony.
