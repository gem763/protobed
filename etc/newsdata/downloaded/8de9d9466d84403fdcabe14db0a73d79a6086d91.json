Are these party leaders also going to call for the resignation of Lord Burnett, the Lord Chief Justice; Sir Terence Etherton, the Master of the Rolls; and Dame Victoria Sharp, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, who ruled that the Prime Minister acted legally? Arthur Scargill\n\nPresident, National Union of Mineworkers 1982-2002\n\nBarnsley, South Yorkshire\n\nBrexit has certainly created some unlikely alliances.\n\nWho would ever have imagined that among the most dedicated saboteurs of Brexit would be Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames?\n\nWho would ever have imagined that among its most passionate and articulate supporters would be such rabid leftists as George Galloway and Arthur Scargill?\n\nWe are NOT the \u201cfar-right\u201d. We are the majority in a national referendum we were promised would be implemented. We are being cheated. We will not accept that. The greatest recruiting sergeants for the far-right are those seeking to steal the referendum result and wreck #Brexit \u2014 George Galloway (@georgegalloway) September 27, 2019\n\nIn light of my previous column on the prospects of a Brexit-induced civil war, I am particularly happy \u2014 though not wholly surprised \u2014 to find the mineworkers (well, former mineworkers) on the side of the goodies.\n\nIf and when it all kicks off, I think we can also count on: sturdy rural folk; fox hunting people (handy cavalry); the Army (squaddies and NCOs, anyway: and frankly who needs the officers?); the police rank and file (but not the senior officers, but again, who cares: they\u2019re all either over promoted women who\u2019d be useless in a ruck; or pen pushers and cowards like the Met Police commissioner who stayed in his car when Islamic terrorist Khalid Masood was busy stabbing one of his officers to death)\u2026\n\nCivil wars are horrible things \u2014 I\u2019ve seen Goya\u2019s Atrocities of War etchings and I\u2019m not sure I fancy experiencing this kind of thing for real.\n\nThen again, if push comes to shove, I\u2019m quietly confident of the Brexiteers\u2019 chances. Boris Johnson, I remember, is particularly good in a scrum\u2026\n\nDelingpole: Britain\u2019s Remoaner Establishment Is Fomenting Civil War https://t.co/aBrRXglPae \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 26, 2019", "description": "Arthur Scargill -- bane of Margaret Thatcher, architect of the 1980s miners' strike, hard-left trade union leader -- has come out for Brexit.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/scargill-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
