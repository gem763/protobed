Deal with it,\u2019\u201d Leo Lech told the Washington Post, in an interview after the shock ruling.\n\nWhat happened to us should never happen in this country, ever.\n\nThe Lechs sued after the city gave them just $5,000 to cover the expense of being rendered homeless in 2015. The house was condemned \u2013rebuilding it cost almost $400,000, Leo claimed\u2013 and such a tiny sum fobbed off as compensation \u201cwas insulting.\u201d But in 2018, a judge sided with the police, deeming the damage justified. Tuesday\u2019s ruling, by a panel of three judges, affirmed that decision.\n\nA shoplifter with no relation to the Lechs, Jonathan Seacat, randomly selected their house as his hideout as he fled from police on June 3, 2015. When police first entered the home, he shot through the floor at them, inspiring them to bring in the heavy artillery. Over the course of the next 19 hours, police rammed the house repeatedly with an armored Bearcat vehicle and used explosives - including 72 chemical bombs and gas grenades - to gain access to the suspect.\n\nBut, because their home was destroyed in the course of a police raid, the judges ruled, the Lechs were not entitled to compensation under the \u201ctakings clause\u201d \u2013 the constitutional requirement that the government pay property owners for land it confiscates, usually under eminent domain. After all, the property was destroyed in the course of \u201claw enforcement\u201d \u2013 the police acted \u201cto preserve the safety of the public\u201d when they all but demolished the Lechs\u2019 home to arrest a shoplifter, according to the court.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Make New Mexico pay for it!\u2019 Twitter baffled after Trump vows to build wall in Colorado\n\n\u201cWe\u2026reject the Lechs\u2019 assertion that the police power does not encompass the state\u2019s ability to seize property from an innocent owner,\u201d Judge Nancy Moritz wrote in her decision affirming the 2018 ruling, insisting \u201cthe defendants\u2019 actions benefited the public.\u201d\n\nThe state should not be required to pay for property damages incurred in the act of keeping the public safe, lest the threat of hefty compensation stop them from performing their duties, Moritz continued.\n\nLike this story?
