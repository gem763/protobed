But, it\u2019s not exactly the Moscow-based Borscht bowl of collusion we\u2019ve been promised. Unless the Kremlin was directing the American media to collude with the American Department of Justice.\n\nThat\u2019s right, it was the media colluding with agents and executives at every level of the FBI to try to affect the results of the 2016 presidential election. Hey Robert Mueller, where\u2019s your grand jury now?\n\nThe Office of Inspector General\u2019s report on the FBI and Justice Department\u2019s handling (and mishandling) of the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of an unauthorized, non-secure email server to conduct secret government business as Secretary of State revealed real and damning information on the media and their incestuous relationship with the deepest members of the deep state.\n\nWhile the FBI was leaking worse than the Stanley Cup after a rough all-nighter with Alex Ovechkin, reporters were funneling gifts - pay-offs if you will - back to the leakers in the form of tickets to sporting events, golf outings, dinners, drinks, invites to private exclusive parties and more.\n\nIn other words, the complaints about the biased media working with biased and powerful federal bureaucrats who meet at private and elite cocktail parties to plot their own agenda and the downfall of their political enemies was not some paranoid fever dream of the conservative media it was true and, apparently, business as usual in Obama\u2019s Washington circa 2016.\n\n\u201cWe identified instances where FBI employees improperly received benefits from reporters, including tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events,\u201d reads Michael Horowitz\u2019 report, but the IG\u2019s did nothing to directly recommend discipline or criminal referrals for these infractions because they did not fall under the scope of his investigation.\n\nHorowitz has a separate investigation on the culture of leaks at the FBI and \u201cwill separately report on those investigations as they are concluded\u201d the report stated.\n\nThe Daily Caller\u2019s Kevin Daley points out the gifts from reporters to leaking FBI agents could be a violation of federal law:\n\nThe rules define a prohibited source as a person who:\n\nIs seeking official action by, is doing business or seeking to do business with, or is regulated by the employee\u2019s agency; or\n\nHas interests that may be substantially affected by performance or nonperformance of the employee\u2019s official duties. Those definitions derive from the U.S. Code that states violations will be sanctioned \u201cin accordance with any applicable laws, executive orders, and rules or regulations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at this point when a normal American, (not one steeped in the deep and vast knowledge of the DC Swamp and the \u201cway things work\u201d in the federal government) throws their remote across the room and screams \u201cHOW IS THIS NOT A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW???!!??\u201d\n\nAnd they have every reason to be frustrated and disgusted.\n\nIn any other person\u2019s reality, the picture painted by IG Horowitz sure looks like corrupt, illegal behavior at the most insidious and powerful levels of our government:\n\nReporter: \u201cHey, can you leak some information to me to help Hillary out and hurt Trump?\n\nFBI Agent: \u201cNah, can\u2019t do it, brah. I\u2019m not authorized. It would be against the law. \u201c\n\nReporter: \u201cCome on, man. We gotta get some more info out there. Trump\u2019s killing Hillary on this email stuff and she sucks at explaining this away. I mean, we\u2019re trying our best to downplay this thing, but we need something out there to help her along before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nFBI Agent: \u201cYeah, I hear ya man. But, I can\u2019t jeopardize my job by leaking to you. And, you know, I have to investigate what could be a crime here. I mean, I swore an oath to uphold the law and justice can\u2019t be served if little drips and drabs of secret information is leaking out to the press.\u201d\n\nReporter: \u201cI respect your integrity. I really do. How about if I give you some Redskins tickets and get you a couple rounds of golf at Congressional?\u201d\n\nFBI Agent: \u201cDude! What do you want to know? Mi email inbox es su email inbox.\u201d\n\nAnd this behavior may be a violation of law?\n\nWe\u2019ve been told that nefarious agents of foreign governments colluded with political players in America to thwart the democratic process during the 2016 election. That unproven allegation was so serious that it triggered a Special Counsel investigation.\n\nWe now have a report detailing a tangled and unethical web of collusion between American journalists and FBI agents to leak information to harm Donald Trump and help Hillary Clinton.\n\nThere\u2019s your collusion. Now, where\u2019s the grand jury?\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
