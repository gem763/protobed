The only argument is about whether the increase is \u2018\u2018significant\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe standard measure of income inequality compiled by the ABS \u2013 the Gini coefficient \u2013 rose from 0.30 to 0.33 over the past two decades. OECD data show this is the difference between inequality in Switzerland and in Russia.\n\nIncome inequality in Australia has not increased as much as it has in the United States but this is no reason for complacency. Economic growth over the past two decades has meant that in Australia even those on the lower incomes have seen, on average, some real increase. In a slowing economy this may not continue to be the case.\n\nDr John Hawkins\n\nUniversity of Canberra\n\nHigher super rate would benefit us all\n\nIn \u2018\u2018Albo enlists Keating for super fight\u2019\u2019 (October 26-27), Paul Keating is reported to have said \u2018\u2018Superannuation has revolutionised Australia. It\u2019s the greatest reform to capital markets in the history of the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nIs it not true that the previous two years of trade surpluses have been aided by superannuation funds? Having invested internationally, they are now providing returns by way of cash inflows to the country.\n\nIt means somewhat less reliance on iron ore and coal and potentially having much greater impact in years to come.\n\nRaising the superannuation contribution rate not only benefits individual superannuants, it benefits the entire country.\n\nElizabeth Wirtz\n\nCape Woolamai, Vic\n\nMyer, analysts and investor information\n\nJustice Jonathan Beach claims that Myer\u2019s misleading of the market between September 11, 2014, and March 19, 2015 \u201c... is likely to have had no or no material effect on the market price of [Myer] securities\u201d because \u201c... the hard-edged scepticism of the market analysts and market makers at the time of the contraventions had already deflated Mr Brookes\u2019 inflated views\u201d (\u2018\u2018Myer misled shareholders but still wins\u2019\u2019, October 24).\n\nThese \u201cmarket analysts and market makers\u201d obviously had the information, and acted on it. But where did they get this information from? Certainly not from a properly informed market. The laws governing market disclosure are designed so that all investors are protected by access to information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalcolm Cameron\n\nCamberwell, Vic\n\n\u2018Big stick\u2019 could be applied elsewhere\n\nThe spectacle of Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg berating the banks for not passing on the three Reserve Bank cash rate cuts is normal theatre.\n\nBut why stop at the banks? The \u2018\u2018big stick\u2019\u2019 that was applied to energy providers could equally be applied to the oil companies gouging drivers. Or applied to milk prices to appease the dairy farmers and break up the supermarket duopoly.\n\nIs one ineffective \u2018\u2018fig leaf\u2019\u2019 sufficient to portray policy action for this \u2018\u2018free market\u2019\u2019 government?\n\nWe could always have a few more inquiries, produce some more reports that are never released and hope everybody focuses on the cricket this summer.\n\nBarry Cook\n\nSoldiers Point, NSW\n\nRBA funding banks: what would it cost?\n\nSo the Reserve Bank thought it was a good idea to fund the banks threatened by historically low interest rates (October 28).\n\nWhy was similar protection not offered to our car industry or to much of our manufacturing industry hit by extreme energy prices?\n\nThis policy doesn\u2019t make any sense as it contradicts liberal ideology that all businesses should stand on their own.\n\nHow much would the RBA be prepared to fund and for how long? What would be the cost to the taxpayer?\n\nRodney Green\n\nBurwood, Vic\n\nAFP should raid Taylor\n\nWill the AFP raid the office of Energy Minister Angus Taylor concerning a document used to mislead the public and Parliament?\n\nMalcolm McDonald\n\nBurwood, Vic", "description": "Energy shortages, GST, superannuation, Big Stick, Myer, inequality, Angus Taylor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6931%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_256%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/19cb9f5e1a140827f26668bec25dcfac167129ba", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
