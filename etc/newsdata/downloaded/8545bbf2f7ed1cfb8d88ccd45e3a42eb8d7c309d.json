A review of Native Bankside, London", "language": "en", "text": "We\u2019ve had country house hotels, boutique hotels, restaurants with rooms - and now along comes the \u2018aparthotel.\u2019 Right now, it\u2019s not an overly crowded market, at least not at the affordable level. But I can see its potential, particularly in big cities such as London.\n\nA company called Native has no fewer than 16 sites in the capital and one each in Glasgow and Manchester.\n\nI\u2019ve booked a berth at its Bankside branch in tiny Bear Gardens, just around the corner from the Globe Theatre.\n\nThe Bankside branch is located in Bear Gardens, just around the corner from the Globe Theatre\n\nIt used to be a Victorian tea warehouse, hence its name, Empire Warehouse, lit up outside invitingly. There\u2019s a 24-hour manned reception desk in the lobby, a gym on the fifth floor and a pantry on the first floor.\n\nI\u2019m paying \u00a3120 for what\u2019s called a \u2018premium studio\u2019. And that\u2019s exactly what it is. The cleverly designed kitchen has everything you might need \u2014 and more. There\u2019s an oven, large fridge, two electric hobs, a combo washing machine/dryer, pots and pans, plates, bowls, wine glasses. Even a cheese grater and mini-dishwasher.\n\nThe room has a wooden floor in the kitchen area; grey carpet elsewhere. There\u2019s some bare brick, a comfortable bed, a huge wardrobe and no clutter.\n\nI can\u2019t master the trendy lighting and the pillows aren\u2019t quite top-notch, but I completely get the concept. Presumably most people stay more than one night to take advantage of everything you don\u2019t get in a traditional hotel, in which case it represents real value. What\u2019s more, the pantry is very generous.\n\n\u2018Here\u2019s [sic] a few bits to get you going in your apartment \u2014 enjoy!\u2019 says a hand-written sign. In addition to tea, coffee and all kinds of herbal infusions, there\u2019s a shelf of Heinz baked beans, tins of chopped tomatoes, glass jars of sun-dried tomato pesto, instant porridge, pasta, muesli, marmalade, jam, honey, fresh fruit, popcorn and crisps.\n\nThe apartments come with fully equipped kitchens and free kitchen cupboard essentials\n\nSurely I can\u2019t just help myself. I go down to reception and seek guidance. \u2018Yes, it\u2019s all complimentary,\u2019 I\u2019m told.\n\nLaden with goodies, I return to my studio and sit at the small kitchen table, where Native has provided a map of the local area, highlighting nearby bars, restaurants and galleries.\n\n\u2018We might be seen as one of the leading boutique accommodation providers in the UK,\u2019 says Native\u2019s blurb.\n\nThey might be right.", "description": "Native has 16 sites in the capital and one each in Glasgow and Manchester.
