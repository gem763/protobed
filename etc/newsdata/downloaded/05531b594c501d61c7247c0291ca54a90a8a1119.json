Errol Spence Jr and Shawn Porter provide the latest instalment of what has blossomed into an unofficial tournament with promise to leave a lasting legacy.\n\nSpence Jr, from Desoto, Texas, is evidently hungry to fight the best and on Saturday he hopes to unify one of boxing\u2019s glamour divisions.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRecently serenaded by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who hopes to persuade \u2018The Truth\u2019 to intermittently showcase his prime years inside his spaceship-like AT&T stadium, the bludgeoning body puncher, who cut Kell Brook down at Bramall Lane in 2017 to truly arrive at the top of the sport, is now beginning to add more weapons to his game.\n\nThe 29-year-old unveiled a dominant jab against the undersized Mikey Garcia earlier this year, blanking the former four-weight world champion in front of almost 50,000. But Porter, an ardent Cleveland Browns fan, provides a different test. The buccaneering Akronite offers both danger and opportunity in a fight that could develop up close: ideal ingredients to add a thrilling element alongside his WBC belt and Spence Jr\u2019s IBF title.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great body puncher,\u201d Phil Lo Greco tells The Independent as one of just two fighters, with Brook, to share the ring with Spence Jr and Porter. \u201cHis body shots immediately caught my attention.\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time we saw a southpaw like Errol who can dig to the body? Not just throw body shots, like Joe Calzaghe, I\u2019m talking about a real digger here.\u201d\n\nGreat things have been expected of Spence Jr ever since reportedly bringing too much exuberance to a sparring session with Floyd Mayweather Jr.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Porter finds himself in a familiar position as underdog, having scrapped his way to the top. The devout Christian is trained by his father Kenny, who once coached Spence Jr in the United States\u2019 Olympic set-up ahead of the 2012 Games. Despite never being friends, the pair have interacted over the years with Porter recently recalling the moment he became aware of Spence Jr\u2019s tenacity. It was not in the ring but at his pickup basketball game last year.\n\nPorter\u2019s pugilistic style has clearly irked Spence Jr though, presumably once he became aware he would be forced to take him out should he eventually acquire undisputed status. The simmering tension between the pair has now reached boiling point, with the bitterness perhaps luring Spence Jr away from the calculated, yet cautious display against Garcia in favour of pursuing a win on Saturday in \u201cdominating fashion\u201d, something that could favour Porter.\n\nErrol Spence defeats Mikey Garcia via a wide unanimous decision (Getty)\n\n\u201cHe is kind of dirty,\u201d Spence Jr claims. \u201cA lot of times he does like to fight dirty, especially if things don\u2019t go his way.\n\n\"All his fights are close decisions and split decisions - that's the only way he can stay close to the top-level fighters. You're an in-shape street fighter.\u201d\n\nDespite dismissing Porter publicly, Spence Jr is almost certainly preparing for his toughest test to date, one which may force him into demonstrating another unseen skill in the form of a back-foot game so rarely seen - or needed - in his 25-0 career to date.\n\nOnce both fighters have taken a close look at each other after that first bell, Porter will presumably set a tireless pace to challenge Spence Jr into matching one of his strongest qualities.\n\n\u201cHe was so hungry,\u201d Lo Greco recalls from their 2013 10-round bout. \u201cHe wanted it more than me. He throws a lot of punches, he\u2019s strong, but he does push a lot with his punches and wastes a lot of energy for no reason in my opinion.\n\n\u201cBut no, he\u2019s not a dirty fighter, he doesn\u2019t do it intentionally, it\u2019s just his style.\u201d\n\nShawn Porter knocks down Phil Lo Greco in their 2013 bout (Getty)\n\nLo Greco, who was stopped in three rounds by Spence Jr after accepting the fight on short notice, believes the favourite \u201cdominates\u201d the fight, notwithstanding any weight issues, with the tantalising prospect of future fights up to middleweight.\n\nAnd fellow champions Manny Pacquiao and Terence Crawford will watch on with intrigue, but for now Porter has vowed to force his rival into a long arduous night.\n\n\u201cThis fight is a mental war as much as it\u2019s a physical one,\u201d Porter adds. \u201cHe\u2019s young, technically savvy and tenacious. People say, \u2018he\u2019s the next coming.\u2019\n\n\u201cI have advantages that are flying under the radar. Guys can\u2019t handle my aggressive attack.\n\n\u201cHe didn't knock out 135lbs Mikey Garcia so he ain't knocking out 147lbs 'Showtime' Shawn Porter. I'll be there until the last round.\u201d", "description": "The welterweight division is edging closer to finding out \u2018The Truth\u2019 about who is No 1.
