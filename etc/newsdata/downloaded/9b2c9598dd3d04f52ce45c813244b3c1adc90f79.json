It also meant the path to profitability for the company may not be as smooth as many analysts had priced in, especially at a time when it\u2019s bleeding cash and borrowing heavily to produce new content.\n\nCompetition Is Intensifying\n\nThe shock on 2Q earnings also forced investors to take the upcoming competition more seriously. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: ) announced in August that it\u2019s offering a new bundle of streaming services at a surprisingly low $12.99 a month, with a package that includes family programming, live sports and a deep library of television shows. Disney is matching Netflix\u2019s standard plan and marketing the service at $3 below its premium version.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ: ), another deep-pocketed contender in the streaming business, plans to roll out the Apple TV+ movie and TV subscription service by November, potentially priced as low as $9.99 a month, according to Bloomberg news. AT&T Inc (NYSE: ) and Comcast Corp's (NASDAQ: ) NBC Universal also plan to offer their streaming versions \u2014 all aiming to end Netflix's monopoly.\n\nThe intensifying competition definitely makes Netflix a risky bet in the short-run, but that doesn\u2019t mean the company has completely lost its fan base. Netflix has a strong record of exceeding expectations. For 3Q, it\u2019s projecting the addition of 7 million new paid subscribers compared with 2.7 million it added in the previous period.\n\nIf the company is able to add more customers than projected and continues with the release of new content that could keep viewers stick to its app, we can expect some recovery in its stock.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe upward trajectory of Netflix shares has largely been unhindered in the last few years. The company delivered on average 27% per year growth in paid subscribers during the past five years.\n\nBut with the upcoming competition, rising content costs, and saturation in the domestic market, the path forward won\u2019t be that easy.\n\nIn our view, investors will continue to shy away from Netflix until they see a clear sign that the company is holding up well and can defend its turf. A revival in subscription growth in the second-half will be an important confidence-building development.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: AT&T Inc, Walt Disney Company, Apple Inc, Comcast Corp.
