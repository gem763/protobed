So when you look at the evidence of whether or not the sugar tax has worked, the answer is: it has.\u201d\n\nMr Stevens was speaking at the NHS Providers conference in Manchester.\n\nEarlier on, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the \u201cbiggest single thing\u201d the PM could do to protect the NHS was to show decisive leadership on sugar and salt in food, and clean air.\n\nHe added: \u201cSheltering behind flowery rhetoric about \u2018nanny statism\u2019 doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.\u201d\n\nMr Stevens also hit out at the England and Wales Cricket Board for having KP Snacks sponsor its new 100-ball tournament.\n\nEach team in The Hundred contest will wear shirts featuring a different KP Snacks brand, including Skips, Hula Hoops, Butterkist, Pom-Bear and McCoy\u2019s.\n\nKP Snacks said it was \u201chelping to grow cricket and encourage families to get active\u201d.\n\nBut campaigners said they were \u201cstumped\u201d that the board had thought it appropriate to choose a high-fat, high-salt snacking brand as an appropriate partner for the competition.\n\nMr Stevens said: \u201cIf you think about the extra demand that is being created through the obesity epidemic, with poor diet now a bigger risk factor for ill health than smoking, it is disappointing, despite the good that sports can do, sports can do fantastically \u2013 we see that in many walks of life \u2013 but it\u2019s disappointing when for example you see the English cricket board doing a deal with junk food aimed at children, sponsorship for the cricket One Hundred, I would hope when those sorts of deals are being considered in future, people make a different choice.\u201d\n\nThe NHS boss also called on social media companies to take responsibility for some of the root causes of mental health problems affecting young people.\n\nHe recalled sitting down for a meal with young people being treated at a specialist eating disorder clinic.\n\nMr Stevens said: \u201cIf we are thinking about all of the pressures bearing down on young people, including young women in our society, there is a wider responsibility that goes with social media and other companies to deal with some of the root causes of these increasing problems that we are seeing.\u201d\n\nSome social media companies are acknowledging this responsibility and \u201cdon\u2019t want to get on the wrong side of what I think is rapidly crystallising public opinion\u201d, he added.", "description": "The sugar tax - which came into force by law in 2018 - has led to a 28.8% reduction in sugar per 100ml of drink.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/17/wire-19450686-1570550614-713_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
