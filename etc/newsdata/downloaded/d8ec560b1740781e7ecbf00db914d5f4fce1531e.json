The race was originally called the Hong Kong to Vietnam race, but the course was changed at the last minute so the name was altered to protect the integrity of the original records.\n\nGiovanni Soldini, captain of Maserati, had just returned from the TransPac (trans-Pacific race) but was excited to get to sea again.\n\n\u201cI love it. I spend my whole life offshore sailing,\u201d the Italian said. \u201cI enjoy the independence, and auto-efficiency. You need to fix everything, find your own way, it feels like a great accomplishment. In the crew, you have friends and you can share emotions\u201d\n\nDavid Witt, captain of Scallywag, echoed Soldini.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one who can help us. We\u2019re on our own devices until we get there and that\u2019s one of the good things about the sport,\u201d he said.\n\nWitt remembers being just three or four years old and sailing off a jetty in Sydney, while his parents still onshore.\n\n\u201cI just thought \u2018this is so good\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI could make my own decisions, no one could tell me what to do, and that was the first thing that excited me about the sport. That hasn\u2019t changed. We get out here [the harbour] and we turn right, then it\u2019s down to us.\u201d\n\nBoth boats are capable of flying at over 40 knots. Maserati is heavier, and has foils, which are special daggerboards capable of lifting the hull off the surface of the water to gain more speed.\n\nThe Hong Kong to Nha Trang race typically has a following wind, with swells helping propel the competitors in the right direction. It makes for fast sailing, but the conditions this year seem set for particularly speedy travel. Witt holds the record at just over 42 hours for the original Hong Kong to Vietnam course, but thinks 24 hours is possible this year.\n\n\u201cThe designers will tell us that they [Maserati] will beat us, but the designers haven\u2019t designed [for] the South China Sea [and its] three-metre, very short swells,\u201d Witt said.\n\nThis is Soldini\u2019s first time in the Hong Kong to Nha Trang race. He admits knowing the area, and how the wind plays in certain parts of it, is an advantage, but he is excited to test himself and his crew against another fast boat like Scallywag.\n\n\u201cRacing against them is better, it's much more fun,\u201d he said. \u201c[Scallywag is] very light compared to us, very powerful and very wide, but I'm sure it will be very fun. It\u2019s just a different kind of boat. In certain conditions we are faster, in certain conditions they are faster. There will be a lot of wind, great speed and great adventures.\u201d\n\nWitt has sailed all over the world, including around it as part of the Volvo Ocean Race. But for him, few events match the racing to Vietnam. That\u2019s why he is so surprised to see so few boats enter. Hong Kong is relatively isolated geographically in the sailing world, which makes it hard for sailors to get their boats here, but he still hopes the word will get out.\n\n\u201cThis is the best offshore race in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s downwind, it'\u2019 warm, you leave Victoria Harbour, you finish in Nha Trang, what more do you want? This is as good as it gets.\u201d", "description": "Scallywag and Maserati crews locked together in competitive rivalry and love of the sea", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/17/77cb229a-f07e-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39_image_hires_094628.jpg?itok=Lhf67eyB&v=1571276807", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
