He welcomed Hervey\u2019s efforts, saying the chance to read books is a productive activity for inmates.\n\nStark County Common Pleas Judge Frank Forchione is also contributing books. He says it\u2019s important not to give up on people who got a little off track in life.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Repository, http://www.cantonrep.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A high school student has spearheaded a project bringing hundreds of books into an Ohio jail.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
