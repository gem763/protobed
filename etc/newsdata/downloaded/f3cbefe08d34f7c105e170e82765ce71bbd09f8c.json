Pickering, a diplomatic dean who served in high-ranking department positions and held seven ambassadorships, including to Russia and the United Nations, under six presidents of both parties.\n\nState Department officials strongly supported $141 million in department funds that Congress appropriated this year for Ukraine \u2014 in addition to $250 million in aid from the Defense Department. But there is no indication that Pompeo objected when Trump withheld all of the assistance while Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 and the president himself \u2014 pressed the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nMost worrisome to the department is concern that Pompeo did not intervene to protect U.S. diplomats either enlisted by Giuliani to assist his efforts or punished for being insufficiently committed to the cause, according to more than a dozen current and former officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.\n\n[Holding Ukraine hostage: How the president and his allies, chasing 2020 ammunition, fanned a political storm]\n\nTrump, according to Giuliani, ordered that career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch be fired as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and she was removed from her post in May. In his July 25 call with Zelensky, Trump described her as \u201cbad\u201d and ominously warned that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nYovanovitch and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for Ukraine, were accused by Giuliani and conservative media figures of trying to protect the Bidens from an investigation by Ukrainian prosectors and working at the behest of George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist. The Open Society Foundation that Soros underwrites has been one of the funders of anti-corruption and transparency causes in Ukraine, along with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the congressionally funded National Endowment for Democracy.\n\nOfficials in the department say accusations against Yovanovitch were baseless and in late March began suggesting ways the State Department could defend her. In internal documents turned over to Congress by the State Department inspector general last week, Kent warned in an email to colleagues that Yovanovitch had become the target of a \u201cclassic disinformation operation.\u201d\n\nOne of the conspiracy theories pushed by Giuliani and a columnist for the news outlet the Hill was that Yovanovitch provided a \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d to Ukrainian officials to protect Biden and others. \u201cOne key sign of it being fake is that most of the names are misspelled in English \u2014 we would never spell most that way,\u201d Kent said in one email to colleagues.\n\nKent suggested that the State Department should push back by \u201ccircling in red all the misspellings and grammar mistakes and reposting it,\u201d as the U.S. Embassy in Moscow had done in similar counterpropaganda campaigns. \u201cIf we wanted to push back hard(er), we could consider a similar approach,\u201d he said.\n\nKent\u2019s concerns about the smear campaign were sent to the top U.S. diplomat for Europe, Philip Reeker, and later forwarded to the No. 3 official at the department, David Hale, and State Department counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, a close confidant of Pompeo.\n\nOn March 31, Reeker emailed Brechbuhl a breakdown of Kent\u2019s concerns about the conspiracy theory against Yovanovitch, saying that \u201cit\u2019s a good summary of the story lines being peddled.\u201d Yovanovitch is due to testify before investigating committees on Capitol Hill later this week. Brechbuhl and Kent, as well as Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, are also expected to provide depositions. An expected appearance by Kent on Monday was canceled.\n\nDiplomats who worked closely with Yovanovitch say the State Department and Pompeo did far too little to protect her.\n\n\u201cAll of us felt like she was incredibly shabbily treated,\u201d said a senior Western diplomat. \u201cMy understanding is that Pompeo was quite well briefed and took a passive role when the removal of Masha Yovanovitch happened. He couldn\u2019t have been ignorant of the subject matter or the interests at play.\u201d\n\nState Department press officials declined to comment.\n\nSome officials insist Pompeo tried to shield Yovanovitch. As White House criticism of her rose in the spring, Pompeo \u201cwas trying to save her from what could have happened \u2014 the tweeting, and it could have gotten really bad,\u201d said a U.S. official familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cSo many in the building \u2014 in the bureaus \u2014 resent what is this targeting of a career person,\u201d this official said. \u201cBut it\u2019s so sad that no one can tell them all that was going on to prevent a much worse outcome: a humiliating public thrashing.\u201d\n\n[Five myths about Ukraine]\n\nSeveral officials closely familiar with Ukraine policymaking defended Pompeo as caught between the demands of a persistent president and a deeply skeptical Foreign Service.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the main protagonist in this at all. He really isn\u2019t,\u201d one official said. \u201cHe\u2019s not been personally invested in it. He\u2019s been helpful on policy, but he\u2019s got a whole world to cover.\u201d\n\nThis official and others said that Pompeo had been fully supportive of aid to Ukraine and a Washington summit with Trump that Zelensky so eagerly sought.\n\n\u201cI never heard a word of it internally,\u201d the official said of efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, who Trump has alleged intervened when he was vice president to protect his son from a corruption investigation in Ukraine. Ukraine had closed an investigation on the energy company on whose board Hunter Biden served with no finding of wrongdoing.\n\nChris Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Mike Pompeo should be held responsible for Rudy\u2019s activities.\u201d\n\nThe secretary, one person familiar with events said, was frustrated with Giuliani\u2019s actions and was not privy to many of his conversations with Trump. Pompeo listened in on the July call between Trump and Zelensky, this person said, because he was nervous about what Trump might say.\n\nOthers are far from certain about Pompeo\u2019s role. State Department officials were buoyed by Pompeo when he arrived at the department 18 months ago promising to restore their \u201cswagger\u201d after the tenure of the doleful and isolated Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s first secretary. Now many agree with one anxious official who said that keeping up with the newest text messages and press accounts has become exhausting. \u201cI just want the soap opera to end,\u201d the official said.\n\nWith little information forthcoming from Pompeo\u2019s seventh-floor department enclave, many diplomats have been left wondering whether their standard-bearer was an active participant in Giuliani\u2019s and the president\u2019s pressure and conspiracy theories, or pushed back when he could, or simply surrendered control over the nation\u2019s diplomacy to Trump\u2019s political interests.\n\nSeveral people with direct knowledge of events said Pompeo was regularly informed by State Department diplomats of Giuliani\u2019s activities regarding Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani, who pressed the interests of Trump \u2014 \u201cmy client\u201d \u2014 throughout the spring and summer in meetings and messages with diplomats and Ukrainian officials, offered a two-edged assessment of Pompeo in an interview with The Washington Post on Thursday, saying that the secretary knew everything but was a disappointment who did little.\n\nAfter Giuliani said he provided the State Department with information about the perceived lack of loyalty by some department officials, he said, \u201cI was told by the secretary they were going to investigate it internally. . . . I believed I had found someone who was going to look into this.\u201d But Trump, he said, had to demand \u201cthree times\u201d that Pompeo fire Yovanovitch. \u201cThe State Department was undercutting it,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThey were protecting her.\u201d\n\nSome said the secretary tried to block Giuliani\u2019s efforts, or at least \u201cwas happy\u201d that his diplomats \u201cwere trying to contain and fix it,\u201d according to a person close to Kurt Volker, the administration\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine who resigned a week ago. Volker spoke to investigating lawmakers behind closed doors Thursday.\n\nPompeo, this person said, \u201cwas very much concerned about Giuliani\u2019s narrative and activities.\u201d\n\nRather than complicity in an attempted shakedown of Ukraine, according to this person and others, Pompeo and his diplomats were trying to facilitate a compromise that would satisfy the demands of the president and his attorney, while promoting a U.S.-Ukraine relationship that would meet the important foreign policy needs of both.\n\nState Department officials were involved in negotiations with the Ukrainians to draft an official statement promising they would investigate corruption cases sought by the Trump administration, according to administration officials.\n\nThe most comprehensively public statement of Pompeo\u2019s views came on a European trip last week, when he spoke to journalists in Athens on Saturday. Everything the State Department had done regarding Ukraine, he said, was in the interests of the American people and \u201cat the direction of the president.\u201d\n\nSpeaking the day after Trump had publicly invited the government of China to join Ukraine in investigating Biden, Pompeo said it was entirely appropriate for governments to trade favors. \u201cIf you can help me with X, we\u2019ll help you achieve Y,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what partnerships do. It\u2019s win-win.\u201d\n\nAmong the open questions about Pompeo\u2019s role is his reaction to the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky that is the center of a House impeachment inquiry. After initially brushing aside questions, saying he had not had time to read a whistleblower complaint that revealed the content of the call and a White House-released rough transcript, Pompeo acknowledged last week that he had been on the call himself. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge,\u201d he told reporters, actions by the State Department in aid of Trump\u2019s goals \u201cwere entirely appropriate.\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement to the investigating committees, Volker said that he informed Pompeo, as well as the National Security Council and the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, that he had warned Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials to avoid involvement in \u201canything that could play into the U.S. elections in 2020.\u201d\n\nIn text messages turned over by Volker to lawmakers, diplomats involved in Ukraine policy \u2014 including Volker, Sondland and William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor, a retired career Foreign Service officer recalled to replace Yovanovitch in Kiev \u2014 rarely mention Pompeo or the State Department.\n\nPompeo is referenced only twice, once when Sondland notes the secretary is about to have a meeting with Trump. In the second mention, Taylor objected to pressure on Zelensky to investigate Biden.\n\n\u201cIf you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly,\u201d Sondland responded.\n\n\u201cS,\u201d in the State Department, refers to the secretary. Kenna is Pompeo\u2019s executive secretary.\n\nCarol Morello contributed to this report.", "description": "Defenders of the secretary say he is caught between the demands of the president and his role as steward of U.S. foreign policy.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent", "John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jOPLz8geJRlEqp94bQzzMviwfSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T6KNIVXJH4I6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
