The probe would focus on payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both women claim they had affairs with the president before he was elected, but were paid off in 2016 by people linked to the Trump campaign so their stories wouldn\u2019t damage his bid for the White House.\n\nThe White House did not immediately reply to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on the reports. Jay Sekulow, the president\u2019s personal attorney, told the Post that Trump did not engage in any \u201ccampaign violations.\u201d\n\nThe payment to Daniels was arranged by Trump\u2019s longtime attorney and former fixer, Michael Cohen, who is currently serving a three-year sentence for campaign finance charges and other crimes. During his trial, Cohen testified that Trump ordered him to pay $130,000 in hush money to Daniels. He later told Congress that he was reimbursed by Trump after he was elected to office, showing lawmakers two copies of checks that Cohen received, including one signed by the president himself.\n\nCohen also helped broker a deal between McDougal and the parent company of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., to pay her off as part of a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d effort.\n\nTrump has denied the affairs took place and distanced himself from the payments, at times saying he didn\u2019t even know about them. His attorney, Rudy Giuliani, later said he reimbursed Cohen but \u201cdidn\u2019t know the specifics\u201d of the payments.\n\nHowever, Cohen told prosecutors during his trial that he had blind loyalty to the president at the time and was being sentenced because of it, noting that he was \u201cgoing to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.\u201d\n\nA judge said in July that the federal investigation into Cohen and any potential campaign finance violations was closed. But the Post notes Democrats believe there is enough evidence to begin their own probe and potentially name the president himself as a co-conspirator in the crimes that resulted in Cohen\u2019s sentence. Any potential wrongdoing would only further Democratic efforts to bring articles of impeachment against Trump and build on what special counsel Robert Mueller said were five instances of potential obstruction of justice during the investigation into the 2016 election.\n\nShould lawmakers open their own inquiry, they may consider speaking with AMI chief executive David Pecker, a longtime friend of the president, the Post reported.\n\nMore than 130 House Democrats have called for an impeachment inquiry, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has continued to resist such calls. Last month, Pelosi said once again that the public didn\u2019t yet support impeachment, saying that Congress\u2019 role was to be \u201cunifying and not dividing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf and when we act, people will know he gave us no choice,\u201d the speaker told fellow lawmakers several weeks ago, per a report by the Associated Press.", "description": "Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen is serving a three-year prison sentence over his involvement in payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ddce7240000ba027279dc.jpeg?cache=94tctfevlr&ops=1778_1000"}
