Whatever frustrations you have, whatever feelings you\u2019re having, just step back. Allow your football to do the speaking for you.\u201d\n\nMarshall, who is not currently on a roster (he worked out for the Indianapolis Colts last month), would advise Brown: \u201cThe game is short-lived. Humble yourself.\u201d\n\n\u2018Find a way\u2019\n\nOwens, of course, once held a shirtless media conference in his driveway while doing sit-ups, a moment that has lived in NFL infamy.\n\nHe believes the Oakland Raiders should stick with Brown but \u201cfind a way, behind closed doors, as men\u201d to work things out.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nBut when it was noted that Brown took things public - he posted a photo of a fine letter from general manager Mike Mayock on Instagram on Wednesday - Marshall said he\u2019d consider moving on from Brown already.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t win with that type of distraction. If he\u2019s going to get better, then ok,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s going to continue this behavior - which he probably will... You can\u2019t win with that.
