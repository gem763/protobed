Two years ago, Williams was coaching the Browns while Beckham was playing for the New York Giants.\n\nODELL BECKHAM JR. SAYS HE PLANS TO WEAR FLASHY WATCH AGAIN DESPITE NFL RULE VIOLATION\n\nBeckham said he was told by Browns players that Williams instructed them to \u201ctake me out of the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had people who were here when he was here telling us, 'If you get a chance, take a shot at him. If you can hurt him. I guarantee he's going to leave the game hurt.' And stuff like that,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cIt's fine. It's football, in a sense.\u201d\n\nOne play that was highlighted was a leaping catch that Beckham made during the 2017 preseason game. He was hit low by former Browns cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun. Beckham suffered a severe ankle sprain because of the hit and didn\u2019t play the first game of the Giants\u2019 season.\n\nNEW YORK JETS' SAM DARNOLD DIAGNOSED WITH MONO, COULD MISS AT LEAST THREE GAMES\n\nBeckham claimed the ankle sprain led to other leg injuries.\n\n\u201cIt's like a known rule, in preseason nobody in the NFL's really out to do stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201c... So you just know who he is. That's the man calling the plays.\u201d\n\nBeckham was asked about the potential defensive tactics he might face against the Jets. When he heard Williams\u2019 name, he seized the opportunity to bring up the claim.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I'm buying [for Monday's game] is you know probably just got to watch out for the cheap shots and the dirty hits and all the things that he likes to teach,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cThat's pretty much all we've got to watch out for. Other than that, I expect the same.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWilliams was at the center of the so-called \u201cBountygate\u201d scandal when he was with the New Orleans Saints. He was suspended for a year in 2012 after Saints players were found to be operating by a bounty system in which they would receive a bonus for hard hits and deliberately injuring players.\n\nWilliams has not responded publicly to Beckham's claims.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Odell Beckham Jr. accused New York Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams of trying to get players to injure him during a preseason game two years ago.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
