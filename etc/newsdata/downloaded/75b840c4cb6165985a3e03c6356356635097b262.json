So that was the challenge, to get open, catch the football and make plays for this team, regardless of what's going on outside of this building,\" Flores said of playing the songs during practice.\n\nNow, Houston will be paying Skills\u2019 $7,975,000 base salary for 2019, while also picking up the tab for Tunsil\u2019s relatively modest $2.15 million salary, which is set to increase to $10.35 million next year. The timing of Tunsil's trade almost makes it seem as if the Dolphins aren't looking to spend that kind of money on him.\n\nHowever, the move could prove to cause some turmoil in the Dolphins locker room, with Tunsil being one of the team\u2019s best and most impactful players on the team.\n\n\u201cThe backlash would be amazing,\u201d a source told the Miami Herald. \u201cGuys would legit revolt.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins are projected to be one of the worst teams in the league this year, however the team has repeatedly denied they are deliberately tanking as they look to rebuild with four first-round draft picks and four second-round picks for the 2020 and 2021 NFL drafts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Miami Dolphins are trading Laremy Tunsil and Kevin Stills to the Houston Texans for a handful of first and second-round draft picks, but the reasons for trading the two might have more purpose than that.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Tunsil-Stills.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
