The Colts had just lost a preseason game to Chicago at home. Luck, sidelined with an injury to his calf and ankle, did not play but felt the fans\u2019 wrath as reports spread through Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t hear it,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIt hurt.\u201d\n\nBut Luck took the high road with his farewell message.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the honor of a lifetime to represent the Colts and the city of Indianapolis on the world\u2019s stage,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn today's Sunday Star, retired QB Andrew Luck thanks the city of Indianapolis and Colts fans.\n\n\n\nBe sure to pick up a copy that has a special section dedicated to the career of No. 12. pic.twitter.com/lgLLt7lT6u \u2014 IndyStar (@indystar) September 1, 2019\n\nLuck, who has endured serious shoulder trouble, a lacerated kidney and at least one concussion, explained previously that the unrelenting cycle of injuries, pain and rehab had consumed him.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowl pick and reigning Comeback Player of the Year still faced harsh criticism for his decision to leave the NFL.
