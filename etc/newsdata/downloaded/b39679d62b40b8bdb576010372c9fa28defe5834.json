I would just call out two caveats to the bullish view. One if it\u2019s a straight supply agreement, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s advantageous to Beyond Meat long-term \u2014 that creates volatility in their customer base because it probably implies that McDonald\u2019s down the road might be more inclined to make their purchasing decisions on economics than brand affinity,\u201d explained D.A. Davidson food analyst Brian Holland.\n\nMERTHYR TYDFIL, UNITED KINGDOM - AUGUST 06: McDonald's Golden Arches sign seen on August 6, 2018 in Merthyr Tydfil, United Kingdom.

They are bringing a plant-based burger to the U.S. this fall. I just think there are other solutions out there.\u201d\n\nBeyond Meat without question has wracked up several big partnership deals this year in the fast-food space. From one with Dunkin\u2019 Brands (DNKN) for a sausage breakfast sandwich to faux chicken at Yum! Brands-owned Kentucky Fried Chicken (YUM) , Beyond Meat has shown it\u2019s moving aggressively to expand distribution.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason for the stock\u2019s explosive 136% move higher since the May 2 initial public offering.\n\nCredit: David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nBut despite the major wins, Wall Street continues to eagerly await for Beyond Meat to land McDonald\u2019s as an account. All signs suggest that a deal happening at some point.\n\nBeyond Meat counts former McDonald\u2019s CEO Don Thompson as a board member. Meanwhile, consumer interest in plant-based foods continues to surge \u2014 so it\u2019s bizarre McDonald\u2019s hasn\u2019t at least tested something with Beyond Meat or rival Impossible Foods in the U.S.\n\nNonetheless, Holland advises caution, should Beyond Meat land McDonald\u2019s. Holland only estimates $90 million in gross sales long-term from a deal between the two companies.\n\nIf Holland\u2019s math is correct, that may let down the Beyond Meat bulls.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
