Doctors found no further evidence of cancer in her body and said that no further treatment was required at the time.\n\nGinsburg, who is the oldest member of the nation\u2019s highest court, has fought cancer four times since she was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton. In December she had two malignant growths removed from her lung.\n\nDespite the health woes, the justice has rarely altered her work schedule and has pledged to remain on the bench as long as she is capable. On Tuesday, she told NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg that she kept working through her surgeries to help move past any lingering pain.\n\n\u201cI think my work is what saved me because, instead of dwelling on my physical discomforts,\u201d Ginsburg said, \u201cif I have an opinion to write or I have a brief to read, I know I\u2019ve just got to get it done, and so I have to get over it.\u201d\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t cancel the appearance on Tuesday night because she had promised the Clinton Library that she\u2019d be there, prompting the crowd to break into applause and chants of \u201cRBG! RBG!\u201d\n\nFormer President Clinton praised Ginsburg\u2019s work over the past 26 years during the event, pointing to her long history of landmark opinions and blistering dissents. He also noted that Ginsburg, who was just the second woman ever appointed to the Supreme Court, \u201chad already proved herself a hero\u201d long before she was selected to join the bench.\n\nLate last month, Ginsburg made her first appearance after the pancreatic cancer treatment and referenced her cult status among liberals and her iconic nickname.\n\n\u201cIt was beyond my wildest imagination that I would one day become the Notorious RBG,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I am notorious, it is because I had the good fortune to be alive and a lawyer in the 1960s then and continuing through the 1970s. For the first time in history, it became possible to urge before courts successfully that equal justice under law requires all arms of government to regard women as persons equal in stature to men.\u201d", "description": "The Supreme Court justice underwent treatment for pancreatic cancer last month.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6f32683b0000e000cc3baa.jpeg?cache=xyjokhv5jr&ops=1778_1000"}
