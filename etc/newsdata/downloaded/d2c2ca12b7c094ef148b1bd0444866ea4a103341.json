There may be Republican senators who won\u2019t say a word until the moment they say \u201cguilty\u201d when the roll is called at the end of an impeachment trial. https://t.co/zQJ8xnEfeW \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) September 25, 2019\n\nHis tweet follows Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s announcement late Tuesday marking the beginning of a formal impeachment process. But even before the official word, Conway was pushing hard for Democrats to make their move.\n\n\u201cTrump has already done more than enough to warrant impeachment and removal,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post last week. \u201cThe current whistleblowing allegations, however, are even worse.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, who once slammed Conway as \u201ca stone cold LOSER and husband from hell\u201d is calling it another witch hunt:\n\nWill the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise! \u2014 Donald J.
