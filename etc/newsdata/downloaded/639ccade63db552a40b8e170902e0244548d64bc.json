Has it learned nothing from TV\u2019s dark era of humiliation?", "language": "en", "text": "We just can\u2019t seem to get rid of it, can we? After 15 years of humouring, then later suffering, its roster of manufactured pop stars, The X Factor is back \u2013 but not as we know it. This round, for the 16th time, we\u2019re rumoured to be getting not just one but two iterations of the increasingly insufferable show, with celebrity and all-star specials set to hit our screens later this year.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I was a die-hard X Factor fan when it first arrived \u2013 which is no surprise, given that I was 12 at the time. At its height, my friends and I would toy with applying to audition. Not in earnest, but with the sole intention of trolling the producers (or maybe becoming the next Same Difference). Even then, we knew the format was a cynical operation, with as much interest in tearing down people for laughs as it had in building lasting careers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNow, with viewing figures at the lowest they\u2019ve been since the show began, it\u2019s banking on nostalgia to win us over.\n\nX Factor veterans rumoured to be returning for the all-star line-up include Alexandra Burke, Leona Lewis, James Arthur, Fleur East \u2013 so far, so good. We also (possibly) have Shayne Ward, as well as the novelty turns: Jedward, Wagner, Honey G\u2026 and more.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that it\u2019s a little sad that some of X Factor\u2019s most popular winners are now contemplating taking part in a dying show, there\u2019s something else that\u2019s more crushing: the same format, same contestants, same smorgasbord of talent and clowning we\u2019re used to, but in an age in which smirking at the delusions of the \u201cjoke\u201d acts feels utterly outdated.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And realised that these are real people, even if their goals seem unrealistic. They have never been quite in on the act. They are flung in carrying an air of simultaneous bewilderment and delight \u2013 ever eager to hit the stage and perform warbled covers to a backtrack of KC and The Sunshine Band\u2019s Baby Give It Up.\n\nI\u2019m sure some of them are jumping at the chance of a return to television, their short-lived careers having dried up years ago, but this isn\u2019t the direction we need to continue in, especially not if those behind The X Factor actually want it to survive.\n\nThe Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee\u2019s inquiry into the role of producers \u201cin influencing the behaviour of participants\u201d is looking at similar issues right now. The Jeremy Kyle Show has been cancelled and Love Island is getting some long overdue scrutiny. So why The X Factor would choose to throw itself back under that spotlight, I don\u2019t know. Even aside from the select committee probe, audiences too have clearly evolved an appetite for less exploitative formats.\n\nWe\u2019re increasingly enamoured with the success of the \u201cordinary\u201d in reality TV these days. The Voice, even with its revolving door of judges, is thriving. Over in the US, The Masked Singer, possibly the most zany premise for a music competition I\u2019ve ever heard of, has given performers of yesteryear a shot at regaining some recognition.\n\nAs entertaining as the likes of Chico were back in the day, inviting people like him back one last time in a desperate bid to suck us into yet another series of the never-ending show, is that last thing we need. I would even baulk at seeing my own personal favourite, Phil Blackwell, who once achieved momentary fame for his bizarre rendition of Spandau Ballet\u2019s Gold. Former judge Sharon Osbourne won\u2019t touch the revamped show with a bargepole. I don\u2019t blame her.\n\nI read this week in The Guardian about the debt-ravaged aftermath of The Cheeky Girls\u2019 short-lived fame, a tale much more sobering and upsetting than you\u2019d think. They weren\u2019t contestants on The X Factor, but on its precursor Popstars: The Rivals, but still, their story drove home the importance of refraining from thrusting vulnerable people into the spotlight for entertainment. Let\u2019s hope the producers have taken note.", "description": "We just can\u2019t seem to get rid of it, can we?
