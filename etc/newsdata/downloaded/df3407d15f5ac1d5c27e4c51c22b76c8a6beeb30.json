REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nSalazar, head coach at the Nike Oregon Project (NOP) where Brazier trains, was banned by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency on Monday for four years for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d.\n\nSalazar has denied wrongdoing, vowed to appeal and sportswear giant Nike has said it will stand by the 61-year-old. There has been no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the NOP-trained athletes at the world championships.\n\nBrazier said that he was coached by Pete Julian, not Salazar, and said it would be \u201creally ignorant\u201d to question the validity of his title.\n\n\u201cThe investigation started when I was at high school and to even think that is pretty ignorant,\u201d he told reporters after winning a first-ever world title for the U.S. in the event.\n\nHe said his first contact with the NOP was in 2018.\n\n\u201cI checked out the group in early summer of 2018 and from the start I was always in touch Pete,\u201d he said. \u201cI was never asked to be coached by Alberto the entire time I was at the project.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was an investigation going on. When the investigation started, I didn\u2019t know who Alberto was and even now I don\u2019t now 100 percent what it\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nBrazier added: \u201cThe only contact I\u2019ve had with Alberto has been pleasant. I like Alberto, he\u2019s a cool guy.\n\n\u201cI think the ban on Alberto is very disappointing. At the end of the day he\u2019s the founder of the Oregon Project.\u201d\n\nHe said he would stay with the NOP \u201cif Pete takes control.\u201d", "description": "American Donavan Brazier said after winning the world 800 metres title on Tuesday that it would be ignorant to draw any connection between his win and the scandal which has embroiled leading coach Alberto Salazar.", "authors": ["Brian Homewood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436024864&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903J6", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
