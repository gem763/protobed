(EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nTurkey\u2019s government launched a long-expected offensive into northeastern Syria on Wednesday, with airstrikes and shelling targeting Syrian Kurdish fighters who have played a central role in aiding the U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State militant group.\n\nThe operation \u2014 with some ground forces crossing the border later \u2014 came just days after President Trump\u2019s startling announcement that the United States would not stand in Turkey\u2019s way, bringing sharp rebukes from even the president\u2019s Republican allies.\n\nThe Turkish foray threatened to further fracture a war-shattered Syria as Ankara moved to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d after failing to agree on its size and nature during negotiations with the United States.\n\nTurkey\u2019s goal is to push back the Syrian Kurds \u2014 considered enemies by Turkey \u2014 from the border region. Turkey also claims the buffer region would be fit for the resettlement of millions of Syrian refugees residing in Turkey.\n\nBut aid agencies warned the offensive could create a new humanitarian crisis, as well as a fresh wave of displaced people and refugees.\n\nAn even greater worry was the thousands of Islamic State prisoners and their families held by the Syrian Kurdish forces after the fall of the militant group\u2019s self-declared \u201ccaliphate.\u201d A security breakdown at the detention camps could open the way for the fighters and others to slip away.\n\n[Turkey wants a Syrian \u2018safe zone.\u2019 Others fear a \u2018death trap.\u2019]\n\nAlready, frightened people were on the move in Syria. Cars, trucks and motorcycles \u2014 with no empty seats \u2014 streamed away from the border. Smoke rose from some buildings. Fires broke out.\n\nSome Turkish ground forces moved into Syria after nightfall. A statement from the Turkish military said a \u201cland operation\u201d began in an area east of the Euphrates River but gave no further details on the scope of the incursion.\n\nPresident Trump called the Turkish offensive \u201ca bad idea,\u201d but also stood by his decision to pull back U.S. forces to effectively clear the way for Turkey.\n\n\u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will hold them to this commitment.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe past weeks have seen a buildup of Turkish forces on the border, belligerent speeches by Turkish officials and dire warnings from Turkey\u2019s NATO allies and others.\n\n[Furor over pulling troops from northeast Syria began with troubling Trump phone call and White House statement ]\n\nIn the first hours of the operation, Turkish warplanes and artillery shelled towns along a 250-mile swath, stretching from Ain Issa, about 30 miles from the Euphrates River to Malikiyah, near Syria\u2019s border with Iraq.\n\nTurkish shelling killed at least five civilians, according to the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as the Syrian Kurdish-led militias are known. Mortar fire from Syria landed in at least two Turkish towns, but caused no injuries, Turkish media reported.\n\nThe offensive has presented the Trump administration with a dilemma as it has sought to balance Washington\u2019s partnership with Turkey and its links to the Syrian Kurdish forces that helped beat back the Islamic State.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnkara views the Syrian Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to Turkey\u2019s Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged a decade-long battle in southeastern Turkey for greater autonomy. Turkey has launched cross-border attacks on PKK bases in northern Iraq since the 1990s.\n\nA spokesman for Erdogan, Fahrettin Altun, writing in The Washington Post on Wednesday, called for international support for Turkey\u2019s offensive.\n\n\u201cTurkey has no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralize a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs,\u201d Altun wrote.\n\n[Syrian Kurds see American betrayal and warn fight against ISIS is now in doubt]\n\nThe coming days would make clear whether Turkey intended to conduct a symbolic push across the frontier, or follow through with plans to move deeper into Syrian territory, analysts said.\n\nAs the battle approached, residents of Syria\u2019s border towns braced for the worst.\n\nMikael Mohammed, a Kurdish father of three who owns a clothing store in Tal Abyad, a quarter-mile from the Turkish frontier, said he had not had any customers for an entire day. U.S. troops based in the town withdrew early Monday after the White House announcement.\n\n\u201cPeople who are out there in the streets look as if they are going to someone\u2019s funeral \u2026 People are scared,\u201d he said.\n\nThe town used to feel safe \u201cwhen we used to see U.S. troops in the streets of Tal Abyad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday, we saw U.S. troops, but this time they were on their way out of the area, and that terrified people,\u201d he said.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, worry had turned to dread.\n\n\u201cTurkish warplanes have started to carry out airstrikes on civilian areas. There is a huge panic among people of the region,\u201d Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the SDF, wrote on Twitter. Turkey had conducted airstrikes about 25 miles into Syrian territory, according to another SDF statement.\n\n[Syria camp is at risk of falling under ISIS control, Kurdish general says]\n\nIn the town of Qamishli, the SDF traded fire with Turkish forces across the border, according to a farm owner who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid possible reprisals. Residents hoarded food and lined up at gas stations. People had started leaving the town, headed further away from the Turkish border, he said.\n\nApart from scattered skirmishes, the SDF did not appear to be mounting a full-fledged counter attack, according to Dareen Khalifa, senior Syria analyst for International Crisis Group.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that they are still hoping that this would be a strictly limited operation that would not spread to any Kurdish towns, and that they would be able to continue to keep U.S. protection,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is a battle the would surely lose,\u201d she added, referring to the SDF. \u201cThe flat typography favors conventional warfare.\u201d\n\nErdogan\u2019s government has watched nervously for years as Syria\u2019s Kurds have built an autonomous enclave along Turkey\u2019s border.

(Kurdish Hawar News Agency/AP)\n\nFor years, the United States and Turkey have been engaged in negotiations aimed at soothing Ankara\u2019s security concerns.\n\nThere was also the risk that American troops still positioned in Syria could get caught in the crossfire.\n\nA U.S. official said the Trump administration had provided Turkey with a list of no-strike locations where U.S. personnel were stationed.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee warned that 2 million civilians who lived in the military zone were at risk \u2014 \u201cmany of whom have already survived ISIS brutality and multiple displacements,\u201d the group said in a statement, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\n\nThe offensive threatened to displace as many as 300,000 people, the group said.\n\nAlready, there were reports of people fleeing the fighting \u201cwith only the clothes on their backs.\u201d\n\nDadouch and Khattab reported from Beirut.
