Then the story gets sad.", "language": "en", "text": "It was a dynamic that brought them closer together, despite their distinctly different social strata. And it was in this setting that Eric Pedro Cruz, a relatively anonymous 18-year-old from Florida who played under the nicknames Philosophy and Losophy, had a profound impact on Kiari Kendrell Cephus, better known to the world as rapper Offset from the group Migos.\n\nOffset, 27, moves in a different world from most. He and his wife Cardi B are perhaps heirs to the music celebrity thrones occupied by Beyonce and Jay-Z. They speak to over 100 million followers on social media and regularly make TV and fashion-show appearances when they\u2019re not recording platinum albums. The demands of the highly visible life come with a cost, one that has pushed Offset to sometimes take refuge in a virtual world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just be playing a [video] game because I don\u2019t get to be in the public no more,\u201d Offset told The Washington Post. \u201cI don\u2019t get to go to the grocery store. I don\u2019t get to go to the mall, I don\u2019t get to because it\u2019s like ... it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re not human.\u201d\n\nThe Lawrenceville, Ga.-raised performer is very much a man of his time and generation. His online video game sessions, which give him a path beyond the palace walls of celebrity, are more than just a way to have fun with strangers \u2014 they also provide a forum to make friends, hear news, and, sometime talk about difficult subjects.\n\n\u201cLike everybody is coming and you can\u2019t even enjoy yourself, so I play games, just in my spare time. Just to play the game. And I play with just regular fans, kids,\u201d the rapper said. It was also how he first encountered Cruz, a kid who would have a much larger impact in Offset\u2019s life than he ever expected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI became friends with this kid named Philosophy. I used to play the game and he really got me better at Call of Duty. He was super fire,\u201d Offset said about the 18 year-old Cruz. \u201cHe was telling me a lot of information about esports and FaZe Clan [a top esports/gaming organization]. He was the one who was telling me like, \u2018Yo, you a big influencer, people would love to watch you play the game, bro.\u2019 He was the first one to tell me that.\u201d\n\nAfter Cruz and others told him about Kyle \u201cBugha\u201d Giersdorf\u2019s $3 million win at the Fortnite World Cup, and the rapper identified the growing similarities between the impact of esports and music, Offset decided to invest in FaZe Clan.\n\n\u201cThey selling out arenas like I sell out arenas. Like, what? It\u2019s like the same,\u201d Offset said. \u201cI feel [it\u2019s] like the same influence. People have millions of followers [in the gaming world]. People love it. Like Faze Clan, when I became a member, and they put it up, I gained like 100,000 followers in one day, in like 12 hours.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOffset and FaZe announced their deal on August 15. Shortly after the pact was announced, however, instead of celebrating the news with Cruz, Offset was mourning him.\n\nTwo days after Offset signed with FaZe, Cruz experienced what a police report described as hallucinations while at his home. He was taken by police to Winter Haven Hospital in Florida. Still troubled by the hallucinations, he subsequently fled, a second police report states, taking a vehicle from the hospital and driving it to the edge of a nearby lake. Police divers found his body the next morning.\n\nA spokesperson for the country coroner\u2019s office said the death was ruled a suicide by drowning. That conclusion is something Cruz\u2019s family vigorously disputes. It will be several months until toxicology reports are available to investigators, but regardless of the cause, Cruz\u2019s death marked a sad twist for a relationship forged through gaming. And Offset was not alone in his sorrow of Cruz\u2019s passing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAttracting attention\n\nEverything seemed to be going right for Cruz. In only about a year, the Auburndale, Fla., native had gone from working construction, landscaping and roofing to befriending Offset and starting to manifest his goal of going pro in esports.\n\nPeople around the world had started to take notice of his talent as well, peppering his social media accounts with messages in awe of his performances. Though he was carving a new path in his small town, Cruz believed he could reach an elite level in Call of Duty and, with the launch of a major new league next year, the timing was perfect.\n\n\u201cHe always put his heart into gaming, to prove everyone wrong who didn\u2019t believe in him,\u201d said his mother, Catherine Lugo. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have to believe in yourself first. I know I can do it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nCruz\u2019s confidence was quickly bolstered after he began playing Call of Duty seriously, by both his in-game success and support from fans. Some of whom, like Offset, eventually became friends.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe had a huge impact on me,\u201d said Blas Ramos, 25, a soccer player for the Colorado Inferno of the Major Arena Soccer League 2. Ramos, who met Cruz after stumbling on his Twitch page, flew from Colorado to Florida for Cruz\u2019s funeral, despite having never met him in person.\n\n\u201cFor him to play with me, I felt like it was something big,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cHe got me in with a lot of big [Call of Duty] players. \u2026 He was always trying to help everyone he could.\u201d\n\nDespite the rising tide of acclaim, it took Lugo some time to embrace her son\u2019s goal.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe him,\u201d his mother, Catherine Lugo, 35, said, regarding her son\u2019s plan to become a professional video game player. \u201cBut he told me, \u2018Mommy, you just don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter Lugo\u2019s sister took Cruz to a tournament in Orlando, she began to understand. Her sister told her how many people approached her son, shaking his hand and telling him he would have won if he was on a stronger team.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs he played [Call of Duty] more, we realized how happy and confident he was, then came to understand it more,\u201d his grandmother, Vickie Ramirez, wrote in a text message. \u201cWe came to love it, as we saw the joy it brought to Eric, which in turn gave us joy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to this recognition, Cruz started to make, \u201ca lot of money off of it, and I was like, \u2018Wow,\u2019 \u201d Lugo said.\n\nThen one day Cruz told his sister that he met Offset online.\n\n\u201cHe asked me if I knew who Cardi B\u2019s husband was,\u201d said Breanna Cruz, 16. \u201cHe was so happy and excited.\u201d\n\nLugo said the friendship with Offset made her son feel important, and she recalls his main feeling was gratefulness.\n\nLike an increasing number of gamers, Cruz\u2019s online gaming community was not just a place to talk strategies and business plans. Rather, it became a venue for something deeper.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe talked about some personal things. He asked about my belief in God, and some deeper conversations. Maybe I saw him as a younger brother. I really cared about him, even though I never met him,\u201d said Ramos, who learned of Cruz\u2019s death on social media, as did Offset.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was more than just playing a game. It\u2019s a way to have fun, laugh it out, I just felt connected, we got through stuff,\u201d added Ramos, who said Cruz always talked about his family, how he wanted to give them a better life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to eventually, you know, just bring him a part of something, some way, because he was the first kid to tell me [about esports],\u201d Offset said.\n\n\u2018Much love, brother\u2019\n\nOffset and Ramos said they both became concerned about their friend during periods of time over the last year, when Cruz would take several days off from streaming himself playing online \u2014 unusual among both social media and gaming community stars, whose fans expect near-daily content.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was like: \u2018Nah, man, stay on the game. This will help you get past it,\u201c Offset recalled about when Cruz talked to him about quitting.\n\n\u201cIn my eyes, he was one of the best players. It was a waste for him not to [stream],\u201d Ramos said.\n\nHis death was also felt by the Call of Duty Blackout community, where he had a relatively modest, but intensely loyal following of people, many of whom have accounts of Cruz supporting them. A tribute video for Cruz posted by one of his gaming comrades has about 50,000 views.\n\nOffset offered his own tribute on his Instagram story. \u201cSorry you were so young bro,\u201d it read. \u201cFly high.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Cruz\u2019s mother said. \u201dHe always said his dream is to make it big in gaming and to realize he did just that is a blessing.\u201d\n\nLugo said that one aspect of her son\u2019s legacy stems from one of his favorite phrases. Whenever Cruz was playing and they walked past his door, they could always hear him talking with his squad mates and supporters.\n\n\u201cI would always hear him saying: \u2018Much love, brother. Much love,\u2019 \u201d Lugo said.", "description": "The relationship between a world-famous rapper and a relatively unknown teenager began when they met in a multiplayer lobby.", "authors": ["Noah Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/l2newTPi3I1tU6hu5oRQlN5Qu0E=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OARAYPHRCEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
