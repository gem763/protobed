Photo: Netflix\n\nIn August, Netflix released the trailer for Bill Burr\u2019s stand-up comedy special Paper Tiger that did something a lot of comedians rightly rail against: It took his material completely out of context. As the minute-long trailer flashed quickly through Burr tossing out all the hot-button buzzwords \u2014 \u201cThe #MeToo movement!\u201d \u201cWhite male privilege!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a male feminist!\u201d \u2014 it seemed less invested in accurately portraying Burr\u2019s material than in packaging it as red meat for ongoing comedy debates about outrage, \u201ccancel culture,\u201d and censorship. At the end of the trailer, there\u2019s a quick cut to Burr telling the audience, \u201cBy the way, this is gonna be my last show ever!\u201d Like plenty of Netflix trailers before it, the Paper Tiger trailer promised that \u201cnothing is off-limits\u201d and audiences were sure to be offended.\n\nThe material in Burr\u2019s special was much more thoughtful and nuanced than the trailer teased, but thanks to the perpetual arguments over political correctness in comedy (Netflix has multiple stand-up categories dedicated to it), Netflix tapped into that with edited snippets, sacrificing an accurate portrayal of Burr\u2019s comedy in the process.\n\nThis approach isn\u2019t limited to the political-correctness conversation \u2014 it\u2019s an approach to marketing specials that has been happening for years, with context removed and bits chopped into tiny pieces sandwiched between text saying some variation of She tells it like it is! or just summing up the topics covered in the special. The amount of editing applied to most of these trailers is borderline seizure-inducing, and often what\u2019s left are more silly gestures and reaction shots than actual jokes, like the stretch from 0:25\u20130:30 in the trailer for Arsenio Hall\u2019s new special, or 0:45\u20130:52 in the trailer for Iliza Shlesinger\u2019s Elder Millennial:\n\nThis approach to stand-up trailer editing has become so common that it\u2019s reached the point of parody. In 2017, a team of comedians began releasing a series of fake Netflix stand-up trailers, with one for an anti-PC special called Dangerous including text teases like \u201cbrace yourself,\u201d \u201ccutting them down,\u201d and \u201chard truths.\u201d As pointed out on Twitter by director Daniel Gray Longino, Joe Mande released a promo for his 2017 Netflix special that also poked fun at the common trailer format, with the text overlays summing up things right after they came out of Mande\u2019s mouth:\n\nStand-up fans generally like particular comedians not because of the topics they cover, but for their overall sensibility and the way they approach their craft. They love John Mulaney for his signature theatrical delivery; they love Gary Gulman for his purposeful way with words; they love Maria Bamford for her unwavering vulnerability and the way she faces her biggest demons head-on. But these kinds of qualities can\u2019t be properly showcased through heavily edited clips sewn together, because a pile of out-of-context buzzwords can\u2019t illustrate what makes a comedian truly unique to a potential fan who doesn\u2019t know who they are. There\u2019s a reason why a random YouTube upload of Patton Oswalt\u2019s \u201cSteak\u201d bit currently has 370K views, but the official trailer for his 2017 Netflix special only has 105K.\n\nThere\u2019s a solution to this, and it\u2019s one that Netflix has already come up with on its own. Instead of cutting stand-up trailers into tiny bits and pieces, networks should keep things very, very simple: Trailers for stand-up specials should just be one good joke. They can use this trailer for Anthony Jeselnik\u2019s special Fire in the Maternity Ward as the ultimate template:\n\nIf the joke lasts for a minute, the trailer will be a minute long. If it\u2019s a three-minute bit, the trailer will last for three minutes. If there\u2019s a really great joke that\u2019s five minutes long, let the trailer last for five minutes! No edits, no flashy cuts, no cheesy text overlays, no spelling things out. It does justice to the comedian\u2019s material, it\u2019s more engaging to watch, and as an added bonus, it makes Netflix\u2019s auto-play trailers a little less annoying. Instead of all the editing, go back to basics and showcase the thing that all stand-up specials are built from: a great joke.", "description": "Trailers for stand-up specials are mostly bad.
