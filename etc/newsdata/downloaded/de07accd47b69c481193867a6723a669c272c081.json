Others reported that there was mutual interest between Adams and the Cowboys:\n\nGeneral manager Joe Douglas confirmed that the two did meet last week, but he said Adams is part of the organization's future plans, according to Manish Mehta of the New York Daily News.\n\nMehta provided additional context, including comments head coach Adam Gase made to ESPN's The Michael Kay Show Tuesday evening:\n\nSchefter reported that the Baltimore Ravens were also \"actively going after\" Adams but were unable to agree to a deal with the Jets prior to the deadline.\n\nThe Jets drafted Adams with the sixth overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft. The 24-year-old earned his first Pro Bowl nod last season. During the offseason, the Jets fired general manager Mike Maccagnan and head coach Todd Bowles before hiring Douglas and Gase to replace them, respectively.\n\nThe regime change paired with New York's disappointing 1-6 record this season could have prompted the Jets to consider parting ways with Adams to start over from scratch. However, the Jets were \"only willing to part with Adams for a first-rounder and two second-rounders,\" according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Jane Slater.\n\nDavid Moore of the Dallas Morning News corroborated Rapoport and Slater's report and added that the Cowboys were offering a first-rounder and either a fourth- or fifth-rounder for Adams.\n\nSo, while Douglas may have been shopping Adams, the Jets weren't going to give him away without receiving a hefty return.\n\nAdams expressed a commitment to the Jets, but after Douglas reportedly dangled him ahead of the trade deadline, his loyalty could change\u2014especially if New York doesn't start winning. The Jets are 10-29 since they drafted Adams.", "description": "The 2019  NFL  trade deadline came and went Tuesday afternoon, and  Jamal Adams  is still a New York Jet.
