ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEvery year Americans\u2019 hard-earned tax dollars fund federal agencies that are mainly located in the D.C. bubble. That\u2019s a big part of the problem with Washington: they\u2019re too removed from the rest of America,\u201d Hawley said in a statement.\n\nAccording to data from the Office of Personnel Management, 85 percent of federal employees are already located outside the D.C. metro area.\n\nThe release calls Hawley \u201can outspoken supporter\u201d of the USDA decision to move two of its research agencies to Kansas City, Mo. But that move has proved difficult for the two agencies, with the Economic Research Service forced to delay or quash research after losing nearly 80 percent of its staff as employees fled rather than relocate.\n\nUnder the bill, 10 agencies would be required to move 90 percent of their staff to economically depressed areas in states already set out by the bill.\n\nUSDA would finish its move to Missouri, while the Department of Education would move to Blackburn\u2019s Tennessee.\n\nThe bill would also move the Department of Commerce to Pennsylvania, the Department of Energy to Kentucky, Health and Human Services to Indiana, the Department of Housing and Urban Development to Ohio, the Department of the Interior to New Mexico, the Department of Labor to West Virginia, the Department of Transportation to Michigan and the Department of Veterans Affairs to South Carolina.\n\nDel.

Congress cannot do its job without the unvarnished facts and briefings that nonpartisan agencies give the House and Senate almost daily. I have already gotten language in appropriations bills that would block politically motivated moves outside the National Capital Region, and I will continue to fight these relocations with every tool at my disposal,\u201d she said in a release.\n\nHawley described the move as a way to boost the economy of distressed areas, but critics of the USDA and BLM moves have said the relocations could be an effort to undercut their missions.\n\nUnder the BLM move, 27 employees would move to a new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo. while another nearly 300 would be spread across various existing BLM offices out West. The move would leave just 61 of the agency\u2019s 10,000 employees in Washington.\n\nFormer BLM employees have said breaking up teams and placing them at different offices would \u201cfunctionally dismantle\u201d the agency.\n\n\"In the 1990s, the BLM moved its wildfire staff out West, only to move them back when Congress demanded briefings on new wildfires,\" Holmes Norton said.\n\n\u201cIt is abundantly clear that these unprecedented moves are not about saving taxpayer money or \u2018draining the swamp.'\"\n\nUpdated at 6:09 p.m.", "description": "Two Senate Republicans have introduced a bill calling for moving most federal agencies outside of the nation\u2019s capital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hawleyjosh_071619gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
