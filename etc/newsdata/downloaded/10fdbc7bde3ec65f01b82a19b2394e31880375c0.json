The vast majority of drivers on smart motorways drive within the speed limit.'\n\nThere are already more than 200 miles of smart motorway in the UK, including London, Birmingham and the North.\n\nRichard Goddard, of the Campaign For Safer Roadside Rescue And Recovery, said last night: 'I think the motoring public will be flabbergasted and shocked to see the scale of the cash cow these smart motorways have become.\n\n'We fervently believe they are not safe. The refuge areas are too far apart. Motorists face the petrifying risk of breaking down in a live lane, many hundreds of yards from a refuge area with traffic barrelling down behind them.\n\n'At the very least, every penny generated by these cameras should be ploughed back into making these roads safer.'", "description": "Errant drivers are given \u00a3100 fines and three penalty points under the controversial system.
