My generation has largely failed until now to preserve both justice in the world and the planet,\u201d he said.", "description": "Young climate change activists delivered a strong message to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Saturday: If elected officials do not take strong actions to combat climate change, they will be voted out of office.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432395998&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0OD", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
