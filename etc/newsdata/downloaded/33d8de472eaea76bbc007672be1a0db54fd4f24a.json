The technology uses the 900 MHz spectrum, increasing the connection range of these devices by more than one half mile. Users can place smart devices anywhere on their property and know they\u2019ll work great, even in dead spots where WiFi and Bluetooth don\u2019t reach, according to Amazon.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s Sidewalk is said to be a new long-term effort to greatly extend the working range of low-bandwidth, low-power, smart lights, sensors, and other low-cost devices customers install at the edge of their home network.\n\nUsing the 900 MHz spectrum, Amazon is developing a new protocol project that increases the connection range of smart devices by more than one half mile.\n\nThis technology allows users to put their smart devices anywhere around their property and \u2018know they\u2019ll work, even in dead spots where WiFi and Bluetooth don\u2019t reach\u2019, according to Amazon.\n\nAlthough the technology is still in prototype stages, Amazon has noted that 700 of its employees in Los Angeles were given Sidewalk technology.\n\nThe firm found that just a few of the bubs were able to knit together to cover nearly the entire city.\n\nAnd the co-founder of Stop Spying NY and AI activist has warned that this technology is another ploy for Amazon to spy on consumers, as first reported by Aaron Holmes with Business Insider.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m freaking out about this Amazon sidewalk mesh network stuff. Here\u2019s why,\u2019 Liz O\u2019Sullivan shared on Twitter.\n\n\u20181. Amazon is pushing WiFi so you have to send all your traffic through their access points\u2019.\n\nUsing the 900 MHz spectrum, Amazon is developing a new protocol project that increases the connection range of smart devices by more than one half mile. This also gives other businesses the ability to geolocate you, as all they need to do is probe your phone for WiFi\n\nShe continued to explain that police officials will have the ability to tap into stored recordings of Ring cameras, as the content will be on a person\u2019s device \u2013 calling for the need of \u2018regulation and democratic oversight of surveillance tech\u2019\n\nSullivan continues to explain that using Sidewalk will give Amazon the ability to track you, even if you are not logged onto their network.\n\nThe idea works similar to how you can see other devices nearby even if they do not connect to your WiFi network.\n\nIf you come in range of an Amazon network, the firm has the ability to gather information from your device\u2019s MAC address, which is the device's unique identifier.\n\nAnd if you have ever downloaded the Amazon app or logged into the site with that device, Amazon is able to connect that MAC address with your Amazon account.\n\nThis also gives other businesses the ability to geolocate you, as all they need to do is probe your phone for WiFi.\n\nThe idea works similar to how you can see other devices nearby even if they do not connect to your WIFI network.
