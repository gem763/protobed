The remains were found in a trunk at a business property in Dolton, Illinois. Investigators found five plastic bags and one box containing the fetal remains. \u2014 Max Lewis (@MaxLewisTV) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cBased on that, the family members contacted authorities in Cook County,\u201d said Hill. \u201cCook County contacted Will County authorities primarily because Will County had experience, vast experience in establishing protocols from the last discovery.\u201d\n\nArriving on the scene, investigators discovered five plastic bags and one box containing the remains of the aborted babies, stored in the trunk of an older Mercedes Benz.\n\nKlopfer performed abortions in South Bend, Gary and Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nIn 2015, his medical license was suspended after he allegedly failed to report an abortion performed on a 13-year-old girl.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shock for everyone,\u201d Hill said, adding his office is attempting to help Klopfer\u2019s former patients to determine if any of the remains discovered belong to them.\n\n\u201cOur objective, ultimately, is to resolve this with respect and dignity for the remains and it would anticipate that we would add any additional new remains to the mix,\u201d said Hill, according to the report.\n\nThe priority, he continued, is giving the remains a \u201cproper burial\u201d and ensuring something like this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see fetal remains discarded like so much trash by the side of the road,\u201d said Hill. \u201cImagine, if you will, if we discovered 2,246 remains of adults who were deceased in some type of preservation fluid. Everyone would be freaking out.\u201d\n\nIn a comment sent to Breitbart News, Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s State Policy Director Sue Swayze Liebel, an Indiana native, said the additional discovery is \u201ca stark reminder that the abortion industry profits from the destruction of unborn children and exploitation of vulnerable women on a similar scale every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe grieve for the little ones denied their very humanity and with the mothers forced to relive the trauma endured at Klopfer\u2019s hands, wondering if their child is among his collection of bodies,\u201d she added. \u201cAll of Klopfer\u2019s victims deserved so much better.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence, former Indiana governor, has called for a full investigation into the remains found at Klopfer\u2019s home. Several weeks ago, a group of Republican senators introduced legislation that would ensure dignified burials for aborted babies.", "description": "Authorities discovered additional remains of aborted babies in the trunk of a car belonging to abortionist Ulrich Klopfer.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Ulrich-Klopfer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
