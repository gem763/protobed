The Switch Lite promises a better design for gaming on the go, but Nintendo has only just revealed what is possibly the best new feature for improved portability: A snap-on case with a flip cover for protecting the console\u2019s screen and joysticks.\n\nThe Switch Lite Is Sneaky Good As someone who bought a Nintendo Switch at launch, I\u2019ve been quite curious about the upcoming Switch Lite. After all, the standard $399.95 Switch can do everything the Switch Lite can (and more). The $329.95 Switch Lite loses the ability to output video to a TV or detach the controllers in exchange for a price tag that\u2019s $70 less.

But if Nintendo decides not to release this accessory over here, you can expect to pay considerably more if you have to import one.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of cases for the original Nintendo Switch, but they all tend to be on the bulky side to accommodate extra Joy-Cons, accessories and game cartridges.\n\nThis streamlined alternative is exactly what the Switch Lite needs; it adds minimal bulk while ensuring the console\u2019s delicate joysticks don\u2019t get banged around or snagged in your bag or deep pockets, and it protects that plastic screen from getting horribly scratched up.\n\nFor those who never travel with their Switch for fear of it not surviving, this is the accessory that might convince you the Switch Lite is worth the upgrade and a necessary travel companion.", "description": "It was supposed to be the ultimate handheld portable gaming console, but the Nintendo Switch didn\u2019t quite fit the bill.
