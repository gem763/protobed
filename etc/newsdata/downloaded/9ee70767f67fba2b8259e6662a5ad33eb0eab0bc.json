Find out how to contact him below.\n\nMs K.S. writes: I read your article about the BWC wine company. I worked for them for six years until I was wrongfully dismissed. I took the company to an employment tribunal hearing and won. I was awarded \u00a327,043, but BWC has refused to pay a penny.\n\nThe more I hear about this investment company \u2013 which has used various names but let's stick to Bordeaux Wine Company for convenience \u2013 the more evidence mounts that it has been nothing short of a disgrace.\n\nManagement & Consulting Partners Unlimited \u2013 the most recent company to trade as BWC \u2013 has crashed into administration with debts estimated at \u00a31.6million\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, I have reported how on paper it was run by convicted fraudster Boington Anthony Grant, but that secretly the strings were pulled by Freddie Achom, also a convicted fraudster.\n\nI have revealed how Achom presented himself as a hugely successful businessman and won invitations to Downing Street to chat with David Cameron, and to St James's Palace to meet Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nAnd I have also revealed how the dodgy duo ran an earlier wine investment business that was closed down by the High Court with massive debts.\n\nToday, I can report that Management & Consulting Partners Unlimited \u2013 the most recent company to trade as BWC \u2013 has crashed into administration with debts estimated at \u00a31.6million.\n\nMost of this is owed to investors who poured \u00a33.82million into BWC. Stocks of wine have been provisionally valued at just \u00a32.6million \u2013 a shortfall of more than \u00a31.2million.\n\nThe wine is held at the perfectly reputable Vinotheque bonded warehouse in Burton-upon-Trent. But one investor who contacted Vinotheque was told that the wine he bought could not be identified. Wine was held in BWC's name and warehouse staff had no details of individual owners.\n\nOne of BWC's newly appointed insolvency administrators, Umang Patel, says that trying to match cases of wine to their rightful owners 'requires further investigation'. He added: 'The joint administrators are currently liaising with wine investors regarding the ownership of the wine stock.'\n\nSafe: BWC uses the perfectly reputable Vinotheque bonded warehouse in Burton-upon-Trent\n\nAnd in a major surprise, the administrator revealed BWC has been sold in a pre-arranged deal. The sale took place on September 12, before creditors even knew the company was in administration.\n\nA recently formed company called Distributed Systems Technology Limited (DSTL) has paid \u00a3100,000 for BWC, though the deal does not include the wine held in store. The purchase price includes \u00a31,000 for office furniture, \u00a31,000 for computer equipment and \u00a398,000 for 'goodwill and intellectual property'.\n\nDSTL is said to be an information technology consultancy and it is unclear why it would want the leftovers from a collapsed wine firm, or put a high price tag on the goodwill of a business that comes with little or no goodwill \u2013 but a fair bit of disgrace.\n\nAside from failing to honour the employment tribunal award you won last year, BWC has been under investigation for some time by the tax man, who started legal proceedings a few months ago to have the company wound up. One question that must be considered by the administrators is whether BWC was trading while insolvent, which would be an offence.\n\nI asked BWC and its boss Freddie Achom to comment on the company's failure to pay your employment tribunal award.\n\nTo my surprise, given that the company has gone bust and been broken up, last Tuesday I received an email saying: 'The dispute was contested with Ms S and Ms S was awarded a settlement on conclusion. The settlement will be honoured by the company. We have no further comment on the matter.'\n\nThe unsigned email came from BWC's official email address. It did not come from the administrator Umang Patel. He told me: 'In relation to Ms S's claim, her unsecured claim will be included in the administration.'\n\nAnd he added: 'As a matter of urgency, we are trying to deal with creditors' claims to their wine.'\n\nSo, whoever sent the reassuring email is playing silly games. I would not have expected more than sour grapes from such a rotten bunch.\n\nIf you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing, write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.\n\nBecause of the high volume of enquiries, personal replies cannot be given.
