It\u2019s a pretty organic union for Woodley, herself an outspoken environmental activist who started an environmental nonprofit at 19, was arrested protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, and currently serves as an Oceans Ambassador for Greenpeace. Just last month, she went on a journey to the Sargasso Sea to study how microplastics are harming marine life.\n\n\u201cDude, I\u2019ve been on so many planes I don\u2019t even fuckin\u2019 know what day it is!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cBut with American Express, they\u2019re in a position to drive consumer-based change from their level, and the more corporations are willing to do that because consumers are demanding that, the more that will lead to true progressive change.\u201d\n\nWith that, we discuss the environment, whether she\u2019s still backing Bernie Sanders in 2020, and much more.\n\nHow was your Greenpeace trip to the Galapagos? It looked pretty extraordinary on the Instagram.\n\nIt was wild. It was spiritually, mentally and emotionally profound just to be on the water, to be disconnected from land and the chaos of everyday life, but emotionally and mentally it was also very, very hard and sad, because I was able to witness firsthand the ramifications of the decisions that we make on land every day, and fuck, I\u2019m usually very optimistic, but it was hard to be super optimistic when you\u2019re out there witnessing a piece of microplastic once every three seconds per, like, square inch. The amount of waste that\u2019s in our oceans, and the lack of technology right now to\u2014at scale\u2014accurately and properly clean them up, is devastating. But there\u2019s hope in innovation.\n\nYou\u2019ve been environmentally conscious from a pretty young age, and co-founded a nonprofit as a teenager. How did that come to be?\n\nI just always cared about trees and about the ocean. I don\u2019t really know; I came into the world that way. Maybe in a past life I was a fucking tree, who knows! There was something about nature to me that was so neutral that no matter what was happening at my home or as a child, I could be in nature and it was neither for me or against me\u2014it just was. It had a presence, and it was something that I learned from. In high school or middle school, where there was chaos with girls or boys or the drama of being a human being and emotional creature, nature helped diffuse that for me. It reminded me that none of that stuff matters. It was kind of the greatest friend I had growing up in a way, because it gave me nothing but support.\n\nMy girlfriend has me using the metal straws. What sort of practical things do you do\u2014or would recommend doing\u2014to pitch in and help out?\n\n\u201cPractical\u201d and \u201ccomfortable\u201d is the metal straw thing, becoming mindful\u2026\n\nI told her if I fall and stab myself with the metal straw that\u2019s in my pocket then she\u2019s paying for my medical bills.\n\nYeah, she\u2019s getting you a new liver. [Laughs] Stainless-steel water bottles, bringing your own bags to the grocery store are simple things we can all do. The more difficult, uncomfortable decisions and lifestyle changes we can all make that will make a bigger impact in the long haul is, going to your store managers and saying, \u201cLook, I\u2019m really uncomfortable with these plastic bags, and I have a petition that I got a hundred of your customers to sign, and we really want paper bags,\u201d or going to your local mayor or school board and saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want my child\u2019s burritos wrapped in plastic anymore\u201d\u2014or whatever it may be. Those conversations are uncomfortable to have, but they help move the needle. We\u2019re not protesting you; we\u2019re coming to you and saying we want something to look different.\n\n\u201c You need to drown out the noise and pay attention to what matters. What matters is love. What matters is human connection. \u201d\n\nHow do you manage to stay optimistic given the news about the environment\u2014that climate change could pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d by 2050\u2014and that the office of the presidency is occupied by people with no interest in saving the environment?\n\nIt\u2019s kind of the same thing I was saying about nature as a kid: you need to drown out the noise and pay attention to what matters. What matters is love. What matters is human connection. Bleeding further out of that, what matters is survival. If we truly want to sustain our species, we should pay attention to species that are going extinct, but we also need to realize that we\u2019re kind of in that position as well. If we don\u2019t have a planet, if we don\u2019t have certain animals, if we don\u2019t have a functional, healthy ecosystem, we\u2019re not going to make it. So, do I waste my time with the distractions and the noise of certain politicians or will I put all of my energy into education and knowledge\u2014not for other people, but for myself, and to learn how I can change and help my small bubble of a community. Really, the power always lies with the people, and we\u2019ve become disillusioned because we\u2019ve been told over and over again that we\u2019re powerless, but if every single person raised their hand and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want this anymore,\u201d it would change in two seconds. The problem is that we don\u2019t know how to communicate with each other and find one thing that we can all get behind.\n\nThere are so many things.\n\nThere are so many things, but really, there\u2019s only one thing\u2014and it\u2019s truly love. You break down any social injustice, any environmental injustice, and it comes down to: we all want to be loved, we all want to give love, we all want to be seen, we all want to be told we\u2019re important, we\u2019re worthy, and that we matter, and none of that is happening. We\u2019re trying to repair everything that\u2019s wrong on our planet with Band-Aids, but we\u2019re not getting to the root of the root, which is we don\u2019t know how to communicate anymore or admit when we\u2019re wrong.\n\nHave you been paying attention to the Democratic candidate debates so far?\n\nI missed the last one because I was traveling, but yeah.\n\nAre you still Feeling the Bern?\n\nI mean, yeah. Look, I\u2019m not going to get behind any particular candidate right now\u2014it\u2019s just too early\u2014but where Bernie lies, and his values and his standards and his policies, I\u2019m very much in alignment with. I\u2019m also in alignment with a lot of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s policies and standards. At the end of the day, we just need to fucking get a good person in office. So, I\u2019m putting a lot of my energy towards Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign\u2014not so much for Bernie Sanders at this moment but for politics in general, and just trying to get people passionate and excited for the 2020 election. But I will forever in my heart be an \u201cI Love Bernie\u201d person, because I just think that what that man has done for our country and our world\u2014I spent a lot of the last year overseas, and more people know about Bernie Sanders in other parts of our world than I think they even do in America, because American politics affect so many different countries that people internationally recognize how much good he\u2019s done, and how he\u2019s brought issues to the table that weren\u2019t being talked about before.\n\nHe\u2019s certainly helped move the entire Democratic Party\u2019s agenda further left.\n\nHe switched the GPS of the Democratic Party. He put in new coordinates.\n\nYou said you were trying to increase interest in the 2020 election. With millennials and voting, what do you say to young people who tell you, well, I\u2019m disillusioned with what\u2019s going on having lived under Bush and Trump, and fuck it, I\u2019m not sure I can make a difference.\n\nI feel similarly in a lot of ways. How do you encourage people to vote when they\u2019re handed a provisional ballot on Election Day? How do you encourage people to vote when the nearest polling booth is five miles away, and you don\u2019t have a car and have no way to get there and you\u2019re raising your four children?\n\n\u201c I encourage everyone to vote in 2020\u2014do it for your future babies!\u2014but also talk to people and express where your concerns are. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s crazy that it\u2019s not a holiday.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy that it\u2019s not a holiday, and it\u2019s crazy that it\u2019s not accessible to all communities. It\u2019s very real that for marginalized communities, polling locations are very inaccessible. So for me, the empowerment and the encouragement and the mobilization comes from a place of community. Of course everyone should vote in 2020, but I love focusing on our small communities, because it\u2019s easy with the noise to feel that everything is huge in scope\u2014which it is, and at scale it\u2019s massively important\u2014but real, direct change comes when you\u2019re dealing with it firsthand. It\u2019s so much fun to show up to your community town hall meetings, raise your hand, say, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with this,\u201d and then several months later see that you affected change just by raising your hand. I encourage everyone to vote in 2020\u2014do it for your future babies!\u2014but also talk to people and express where your concerns are.\n\nI remember the day Trump was elected, and it very much seemed like a referendum on women in this country\u2014to elect someone president who treats women so grotesquely. How does it feel to be a young woman in America in 2019?\n\nYou know what? It\u2019s fucking awesome to be a woman in 2019, because so many women are coming together and being vulnerable together, and so many women are saying things now to one another that we never did. I feel blessed because I\u2019ve always had a circle of sisters in my life since I was young, but there are conversations I\u2019m having in my industry, there are conversations I\u2019m having at grocery stores. The other day\u2014this might be too much information\u2014I was having this personal experience and talking in a [bathroom] stall, and the woman next to me started talking to me about the issue, and then another did two stalls down, and this was in a bathroom in D.C., and then we all got out of the stalls and looked at one another, three women strangers in a bathroom, and had a really beautiful, emotional experience. If we weren\u2019t where we were at in our country, I don\u2019t know that that conversation would have been had, and so much healing came from it. Not that there aren\u2019t traumatic things happening every single second or grave challenges, but there\u2019s room for change within our deep, female selves that before perhaps we didn\u2019t think there was room for. I think there\u2019s been a giant shift. At the end of the day, as women, we can say \u201cthis isn\u2019t fair,\u201d but unless we feel in ourselves a sense of deep value, how are we going to make the change that even we want to make? What I\u2019m seeing with women right now is a spark in a revolution of self-identity, and self-identification, and true self-worth, which is really what we need because that\u2019s where true equality will come into play.\n\nSpeaking of quality, I read through the Big Little Lies Season 2 drama, and as a big fan of Andrea Arnold\u2019s, it very much seems like she was undermined by a powerful man on the show and had her vision for it altered. I\u2019m curious what your thoughts on that are now that she show\u2019s aired.\n\nLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m Switzerland in this scenario. I\u2019m just neutral. I\u2019m taking the Swiss stance.\n\nThat\u2019s been the stance of the cast. It seems a bit strange, given that it\u2019s a show dominated by women, to have this powerful dude come in and do that.\n\nYeah\u2026\n\nIs there going to be a third season?\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s happening or not. People like it! I love it, because I get to work with my friends. I\u2019d love there to be a third season so we can all get back together again and have a ball.\n\nHow do you feel your career is going? There was the Divergent stuff, but as a viewer it seems like you really shine in more intimate, character-driven pieces like The Spectacular Now, which is such a lovely film.\n\nLet\u2019s just say after Divergent I took like a year off from acting. It\u2019s demanding in a different way. That particular project was very demanding because we had a deadline to turn out a product, so the creativity levels involved weren\u2019t as high as they could\u2019ve been because of the deadlines. But I feel like the luckiest fucking person on the planet with the career I have and the people I get to work with right now. I\u2019m in a place where I don\u2019t quantify the project based on budget, which is what I used to do. If it was too big of a budget I\u2019d get worried or if it was a studio that was giant I\u2019d get worried, but I don\u2019t have any of that now. It just comes down to the script and the people involved. Something that happens in our industry is, the more success you have the more direct offers you get, and every time you wonder, \u201cAm I attached to this project because my name is going to pull in money from China, or am I attached to this project because the director genuinely thinks I\u2019m the only person who can play this character?\u201d And most of the time, it doesn\u2019t feel like the latter. The worst jobs I\u2019ve ever done are when I\u2019ve taken a project on that I knew from the beginning I wasn\u2019t the best person to breathe air into that character\u2019s lungs, but I did it for various reasons. That\u2019s something I\u2019m very mindful of right now. I also live by the notion that slow is fast. I don\u2019t work unless I\u2019m passionate about something. It always comes down to passion.", "description": "The actress and activist opens up to Marlow Stern about her latest environmental initiative, the 2020 election, and being a young woman under President Trump.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569027257/190919-stern-woodley-tease_ejkxvg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
