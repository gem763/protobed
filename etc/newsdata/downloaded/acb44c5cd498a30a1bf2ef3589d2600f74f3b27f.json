New York was previously shut out June 30, 2018, by Chris Sale and the Red Sox.\n\nJose Trevino, Delino DeShields and Shin-Soo Choo homered to back Minor (12-8), a resurgent All-Star who allowed five hits over 7 1/3 innings. The left-hander struck out five, walked one and threw 111 pitches before being pulled with two on in the eighth.\n\nShawn Kelley replaced Minor and retired DJ LeMahieu and Aaron Judge to end the eighth. Emmanuel Clase shut down the heart of the order in the ninth.\n\nYankees right-hander Masahiro Tanaka (10-8) grinded through six innings of two-run ball. He allowed seven hits, walked two and struck out five for New York, which had won six of seven.\n\nThe game was delayed 2 hours, 52 minutes by rain, but then played under mostly sunny skies.\n\nThe 31-year-old Minor was drilled on the backside by LeMahieu leading off the first, but recovered to make that out and many more after. He allowed just one runner past second base.\n\nMinor and his deceptive, rising fastball were rumored to be a trade target for New York at midseason, but he remained with the Rangers, who improved to 68-71.\n\nThe Yankees\u2019 scoring streak nearly fell Sunday when they trailed Oakland 4-0 after 7 1/2 innings, but New York rallied and won 5-4 on Mike Ford\u2019s game-ending solo homer in the ninth.\n\nThis was the second straight day the AL East leaders were overpowered by a left-handed starter - Oakland\u2019s Sean Manaea pitched five innings of one-hit ball Sunday in his first start since shoulder surgery nearly a year ago. New York has been without a number of top right-handed bats, as Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n, Giancarlo Stanton, Gio Urshela, Cameron Maybin and switch-hitting Aaron Hicks are all injured. Encarnaci\u00f3n will rejoin the team Tuesday.\n\nChoo hit his 21st homer off lefty Tyler Lyons leading off the ninth. The 37-year-old Choo is one shy of his career high, achieved three times.\n\nLEFT IN\n\nYankees left fielder Clint Frazier drew big cheers when he threw out Elvis Andrus at home for the final out of the fifth. Frazier started in the outfield for the first time since being demoted to Triple-A in mid-June for a 2 1/2-month minor league stint that ended Sunday. The brazen, red-headed slugger made a few embarrassing miscues in the outfield prior to the demotion and was tasked with sharpening his defense.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all rosy for Frazier. He overran Nomar Mazara\u2019s single in the eighth, but Mike Tauchman hustled to back him up and bailed him out.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRangers: OF Joey Gallo (broken right hamate bone) was expected to begin practicing. \u2026 DH Hunter Pence (lower back strain) remained in Texas to continue rehabbing.\n\nYankees: LHP CC Sabathia said he had his balky right knee drained and received a cortisone shot but remains unsure about his timeline for a return. \u2026 Encarnaci\u00f3n (broken right wrist) was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in his final rehab game. \u2026 Hicks (right flexor strain) was slated to begin a throwing program. \u2026 RHP Jonathan Holder (right shoulder) was set to throw for the first time since landing on the IL on Aug. 7. LHP Stephen Tarpley (left elbow impingement) is nearing a return. \u2026 Maybin (sore left wrist) is expected to return to the lineup this week.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees LHP James Paxton (11-6, 4.39) walked a season-high five against Seattle in his previous start but got the win in a 7-3 victory. He\u2019ll oppose Rangers RHP Ariel Jurado (7-10, 5.19), although Texas may use an opener before going to the 23-year-old.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Minor and two relievers became the first pitchers in 220 tries to shut out the Yankees, helping the Texas Rangers beat New York 7-0 Monday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Seiner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/rangers_yankees_baseball_39685_c0-158-3786-2365_s1770x1032.jpg?6c96a648ed9dc513f149dd0e095f1fe5fb441035"}
