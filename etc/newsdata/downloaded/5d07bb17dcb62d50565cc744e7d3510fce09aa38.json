Julie Newmar\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNewmar became the first actress to be cast as \"The Catwoman\" in the 1960s Batman TV series, despite having never heard of the character before.\n\nThe ballerina turned actress appeared in 13 episodes in all and would later say how \"satisfying\" it felt to be \"mean, bad and nasty\".\n\nNewmar's other achievements include patenting a brand of pantyhose in the 1970s that were marketed under the name \"Nudemar\".\n\n2. Lee Meriwether\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe Batman TV series was so successful it quickly spawned a big-screen spin-off that was shot between the show's first and second seasons and released in 1966.\n\nNewmar was unavailable to play Catwoman, so former Miss America winner Meriwether was cast in her stead alongside Cesar Romero's Joker, Burgess Meredith's Penguin and Frank Gorshin's Riddler.\n\n\"I did the role the best way I could and fans accepted it, which was really nice,\" she revealed last year. \"I was so lucky to be working with such a talented group of villains.\"\n\n3. Eartha Kitt\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNewmar was unavailable again when the third and final series of Batman came to be shot, so Kitt was cast as Bruce Wayne's feline nemesis.\n\n\"I was in dire need of tremendous help at that time, and like a starving cat I had to find a way to survive,\" she would later tell the Television Academy.\n\n\"[Being cast in Batman] helped me grow back into being a successful name again. People recognised my name, and still do, because of Catwoman.\"\n\nThe singer and actress, who died in 2008 at the age of 81, appeared in six episodes in all.\n\n4. Michelle Pfeiffer\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nCatwoman slinked back to the big screen in Batman Returns, the 1992 sequel to Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster.\n\nThe film saw Michelle Pfeiffer wear a skin-tight catsuit she would later call \"the most uncomfortable costume I've ever been in\".\n\n\"They had to powder me down, help me inside and then vacuum-pack the suit,\" she told the Hollywood Reporter. \"Originally, they didn't leave me a way to use the restroom.\"\n\nPfeiffer, who replaced Annette Bening after she became pregnant, also performed the scene in which Catwoman holds a live bird in her mouth for real.\n\n5. Halle Berry\n\nImage copyright Warner Bros/DC Comics/Kobal\n\nPanned by critics and snubbed by audiences, the 2004 Catwoman film starring Halle Berry was more of a dog's dinner than the cat's pyjamas.\n\nDirected by French visual effects specialist Pitof, the film saw its title character reinvented as a mousy graphic designer who falls foul of an evil designer of cosmetics.\n\nThe film went on to receive four Golden Raspberry awards, one of which Berry sportingly picked up in person.\n\n\"I want to thank Warner Brothers for putting me in a piece of [expletive] god-awful movie,\" she told an appreciative audience.\n\n6. Anne Hathaway\n\nImage copyright Warner Bros/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nCatwoman is never referred to by that name in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises, which saw Hathaway don the familiar mask and catsuit opposite Christian Bale's Batman.\n\nThe Les Miserables star worked out five days a week to prepare for a role she would later call her most physically demanding to date.\n\n\"I love Catwoman's sense of humour,\" she told Fandango. \"I love how sly she is. I love the way she walks a fence, and you don't know which side she's going to come down on.\"\n\nHathaway has passed her own goodwill message onto Kravitz, congratulating her for \"landing the role of a lifetime\". \"Enjoy the ride, Selina,\" she wrote on Facebook.\n\n7. Camren Bicondova\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTV series Gotham introduced Selina Kyle as a teenage street thief years away from adopting her catty alter-ego.\n\nWhen she was cast in the role, the actress and dancer said the show saw Selina at a \"different part of her life\" and that she would not be basing her characterisation on previous paw-trayals.\n\nThe series finale featured flash-forward series in which Lili Simmons played an older kit-eration of the Selina character.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
