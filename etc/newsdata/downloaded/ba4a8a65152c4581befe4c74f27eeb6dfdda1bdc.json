She had suspected that uniparental disomy occurs in healthy people more often than reported. But until recently, healthy people were not taking DNA tests by the millions. A doctor might see a few patients with an unusual disorder, order DNA tests to discover uniparental disomy, and then publish a paper. It\u2019s like only searching for flowerpots under streetlights and concluding that every flowerpot must be under a streetlight.\n\nThe people in 23andMe and U.K. Biobank, on the other hand, skew healthy, and it turns out that even healthy people can have what might seem to be big genetic anomalies. \u201cI like to say it\u2019s normal to be abnormal,\u201d Robinson says. She adds that uniparental disomy sometimes comes up in prenatal tests, and the results can make parents anxious because the existing scientific research is essentially a catalog of everything that can go wrong. This study might add some reassurance. \u201cJust because you have that doesn\u2019t automatically mean there\u2019s going to be anything wrong with your child,\u201d she says.\n\nUniparental disomy is the result of an error during meiosis, the process that forms eggs and sperm. Scientists have proposed different mechanisms, but the most common scenario probably goes like this: The error in meiosis gives the egg or sperm an extra copy of one chromosome, so the resulting embryo ends up with three copies on it. Sometimes, these embryos are spontaneously aborted, but other times, they are able to go through \u201ctrisomy rescue,\u201d in which some cells lose that extra third chromosome and eventually outcompete the non-normal cells. The resulting child ends up with the right number of chromosomes, but not necessarily one from each parent.\n\nThis is all much more complicated than the standard story of sperm meets egg, yet the result is still a healthy child. \u201cIt goes against so many of the rules of biology you\u2019ve memorized in school,\u201d says Priyanka Nakka, a postdoctoral fellow at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and former 23andMe intern who co-wrote the study. Scientists have theorized and later discovered other ways that conception can go very much awry yet still result in healthy children, such as sesquizygotic twins.\n\nWhen uniparental disomy does lead to health problems, it is for one of two reasons. First, a child might inherit two copies of a rare, recessive mutation from one parent. Second, some genes are normally turned off or on depending on which parent they\u2019re inherited from in a phenomenon called \u201cgenomic imprinting.\u201d The gene UBE3A, for example, is only active when inherited from the mother. Two maternal copies of UBE3A leads to Prader-Willi syndrome; two paternal copies leads to Angelman syndrome. They are distinct genetic disorders with very distinct symptoms.", "description": "23andMe\u2019s 4-million-person database reveals how many people are living with undetected chromosomal anomalies.", "authors": ["Sarah Zhang"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_607408484/facebook.jpg?1570737174", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
