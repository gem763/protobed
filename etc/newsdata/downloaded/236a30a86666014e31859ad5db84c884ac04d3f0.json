Heritage senior research fellow, Daren Bakst said the following:\n\nThe EPA and Army Corps of Engineers protect our nation\u2019s waters best when they define what waters are regulated under the Clean Water Act in a manner consistent with the law itself, the U.S. Constitution, and a recognition that clear and objective definitions achieve positive environmental outcomes. The Obama Clean Water Rule \u2014 notorious for garnering widespread opposition \u2014 failed on all counts.\n\nIn an unprecedented power grab, this rule handed federal bureaucrats authority to regulate almost any water imaginable\u2014creating unnecessary regulatory obstacles for everyone from farmers plowing their land to local governments building ditches for public safety to families building their homes. By repealing this rule, the Trump Administration has rightfully put an end to this definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d that made the EPA and Corps more similar to local zoning boards than federal regulators.\n\nAs the administration formulates its own, more appropriate definition of \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d it should respect the rule of law and provide much-needed clarity to ensure an ordinary person would understand what waters are regulated.", "description": "WASHINGTON\u2060\u00a0\u2014 Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) finalize their repeal of the Obama Administration\u2019s infamous Clean Water Rule, otherwise known as the WOTUS rule.
