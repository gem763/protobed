REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\n\nConcerns have risen as the U.S.-China trade dispute and slowing external demand dent Japan\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nThe index of coincident economic indicators, which consists of a range of data including factory output, employment and retail sales data, slipped a preliminary 0.4 point in August from the previous month, the Cabinet Office said on Monday.\n\nThe separate index for leading economic indicators, a gauge of the economy a few months ahead that\u2019s compiled using data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, dropped 2.0 points from July, the Cabinet Office said.\n\nThe last time the government gave a \u201cworsening\u201d assessment was for April data.\n\nThe downgrade could add to speculation the government will hike spending, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday said he was ready to take \u201call possible steps\u201d if risks to the economy intensified following a sales tax hike and rising global uncertainty.\n\nJapan rolled out a twice-delayed increase in the sales tax to 10% from 8% on Oct. 1. The move is seen as critical for fixing the country\u2019s tattered finances but could tip the economy, hurt by the U.S.-China trade war and weak external demand, into recession.\n\nFor April-June, Japan reported growth of 0.3% from the previous quarter. The last time Japan was in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, was the second half of 2015.\n\nIn recent months, the government\u2019s assessment on the coincident index was that the economy likely stopped falling.\n\nThe government will later examine the economy comprehensively with professors and economists on a panel and officially define the country\u2019s economic cycle.\n\nJapan\u2019s growth has slowed as the U.S.-China trade dispute hit the country\u2019s exports, sending big manufacturers sentiment - as measured by the Bank of Japan\u2019s tankan survey - to a six-year low in the July-September quarter.\n\nMarket expectations for more policy easing by the Bank of Japan have increased after the central bank signaled its readiness to expand stimulus as early as its Oct. 30-31 meeting.", "description": "A key Japanese economic index fell in August and the government on Monday downgraded its view to \"worsening\", indicating the export-reliant economy might face slipping into recession.", "authors": ["Kaori Kaneko", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437948048&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9607X", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
