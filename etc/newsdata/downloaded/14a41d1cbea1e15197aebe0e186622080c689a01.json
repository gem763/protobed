Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, is impressed with her political talent. Richard B. Spencer, the white nationalist leader, says he could vote for her. Former Representative Ron Paul praises her \u201clibertarian instincts,\u201d while Franklin Graham, the influential evangelist, finds her \u201crefreshing.\u201d\n\nAnd far-right conspiracy theorists like Mike Cernovich sees a certain MAGA sais quoi.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a good energy, a good vibe. You feel like this is just a serious person,\u201d Mr. Cernovich said. \u201cShe seems very Trumpian.\u201d\n\nAmong her fellow Democrats, Representative Tulsi Gabbard has struggled to make headway as a presidential candidate, barely cracking the 2 percent mark in the polls needed to qualify for Tuesday night\u2019s debate. She is now injecting a bit of chaos into her own party\u2019s primary race, threatening to boycott that debate to protest what she sees as a \u201crigging\u201d of the 2020 election . That\u2019s left some Democrats wondering what, exactly, she is up to in the race, while others worry about supportive signs from online bot activity and the Russian news media .\n\nPerhaps strangest of all is th e unusual array of Americans who cannot seem to get enough of her.\n\nOn podcasts and online videos, in interviews and twitter feeds, alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activists and some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heap praise on Ms. Gabbard. They like the Hawaiian congresswoman\u2019s isolationist foreign policy views. They like her support for drug decriminalization. They like what she sees as censorship by big technology platforms.", "description": "As she injects chaos into the 2020 Democratic primary by accusing her own party of \u201crigging\u201d the election, an array of alt-right internet stars, white nationalists and Russians have praised her.", "authors": ["Lisa Lerer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/us/politics/13gabbard-01/13gabbard-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
