Following the discussions, the two sides offered conflicting reports on the nature of the dialogue.\n\nNorth Korea's top nuclear envoy, Kim Myong Gil, on Saturday said the meeting \"failed to live up to our expectations and broke down.\"\n\nRead more: North Korea claims its 'significant' submarine-launched missile test succeeded\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department in a statement said comments from the North Korean delegation \"do not reflect the content or the spirit of today's 8 1/2 hour discussion.\" The statement said the US \"brought creative ideas and had good discussions\" with its North Korean counterparts.\n\nNorth Korea evidently disagrees fervently, and just days after it tested a new submarine-launched ballistic missile. The test, which took place on Wednesday, was the most provocative missile test conducted by Pyongyang since the denuclearization talks with the US began.\n\nAmid the denuclearization talks, Trump has taken to boasting about his strong relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, widely considered one of the most repressive rulers in the world. But their publicly amicable relationship has done little to expedite the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, nor have any of their three meetings.\n\nThe US has said it's open to returning to talks in two weeks, but North Korea is pushing against resuming discussions as its state news accuses the US of \"spreading a completely ungrounded story.\"\n\nThis is not the first time North Korea has pushed against the Trump administration's summary of talks between the two countries \u2014 they did so after Trump's second summit with Kim in Vietnam fell apart earlier this year. But it's yet another bump in the road for the Trump administration in the prolonged discussions with the North Koreans on its nuclear program and aggressive activities.", "description": "Nuclear talks between the US and North Korea have seemingly broken down once again, and the two sides have conflicting stories on the matter.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d19cd4aa17d6c44a8215e03?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
