Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) held a news conference on Wednesday, during which he responded to the explosive news that the details of President Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president plainly showed him pressing for Ukraine to investigate his most likely general-election opponent.\n\nSchiff generated headlines by pointing out that the call revealed how Trump has betrayed his oath of office, and by arguing that Trump basically engaged in a \u201cmafia-style shakedown\u201d of a foreign country.\n\nBut there was one other less colorful point that the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee made that deserves a bit more discussion \u2014 one that highlights how deep Trump\u2019s betrayal of our country runs, in a bit of a different way than we\u2019ve seen.\n\nIn particular, Schiff noted a glaringly absurd aspect of acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire\u2019s decision to withhold the whistleblower complaint from the congressional intelligence committees.\n\nAs you know, Maguire\u2019s legal justification for this has been that the subject of the whistleblower complaint \u2014 which was deemed \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d by the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, triggering a statutory requirement that it be transmitted to Congress \u2014 falls outside the parameters of the relevant statute.\n\nMaguire\u2019s claim is that the act at issue did not relate to activity that falls under Maguire\u2019s supervision. It appears the acting DNI made this argument after the Justice Department told him to. (The whistleblower complaint was finally given to Congress on Wednesday evening, but only after the House launched an impeachment inquiry to force the issue.)\n\nBut as Schiff noted at his news conference, we have now learned beyond any doubt that Trump tried to leverage the presidency to get a foreign power to interfere in a U.S. election on his behalf.\n\nAs Schiff pointed out, you would think that securing our elections against outside interference would relate to activity that falls under the supervision of the DNI.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice advances the absurd claim that the director of national intelligence has no responsibility over efforts to prevent foreign interference in our election,\u201d Schiff said.\n\n\u201cThat would come as news, or at least it should, to the director of national intelligence,\" Schiff continued, \u201cwho is charged, among other things, with detecting foreign interference in our elections, and with reporting to Congress about foreign interference in our elections.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple reasons why this is a highly suggestive point. First, remember that the inspector general pushed back hard on the acting DNI\u2019s legal arguments by flatly stating that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint \u201crelates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general very well may have been referencing exactly this: The significant responsibility to the American people in question is to help secure our elections, and the whistleblower complaint is all about a threat to our elections.\n\nIn this case, of course, the threat to our elections comes from the president of the United States.\n\nAnd this brings us to the second reason this is so interesting: Remember that Trump fired the previous DNI \u2014 Daniel Coats \u2014 who actually did see defending our elections against outside interference as an extraordinarily serious aspect of his mission.\n\nCoats loudly warned of another round of Russian interference, and he even clashed with the White House over his assessments of the damage done by Russia\u2019s electoral sabotage in 2016.\n\nIn that context, all of what we\u2019re seeing now looks a lot worse. To recap: Trump fired his last DNI, who took defending our political system against outside attack seriously, and replaced him with another \u201cacting\u201d official \u2014 one who received a whistleblower complaint about exactly this topic, and (at the urging of Trump\u2019s Justice Department) worked hard to keep Congress in the dark about it, in potential violation of the law.\n\nAll of this highlights in a particularly vivid way the extraordinary depth of betrayal of our country that\u2019s really on display here.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: William Barr\u2019s role is about to get a lot more scrutiny\n\nDonna F.
