Say hi to the FODMAP family.\n\nOn the roller-coaster trajectory of rising-and-falling trends, \u201cgluten-free\u201d is currently surfing a happy plateau somewhere alongside \u201cathleisure\u201d. As part of a growing free-from industry, it\u2019s survived the wonky path of early adoption followed by mainstream fervour followed by inevitable backlash. Now we seem to be in a steady state of resigned acceptance: no, it\u2019s not a bad idea. Yes, we know it really doesn\u2019t suit some people. But there\u2019s still an outside chance some people are going to judge you for it.\n\n\u201cHave you seen that cartoon?\u201d laughs gastroenterologist and world authority on gut health Dr Peter Gibson, referencing a sketch first published in The New Yorker last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman opposite her bored-looking dining companion and the caption reads, \u2018I\u2019ve only been gluten-free for a week, but I\u2019m already really annoying\u2019.\u201d Yep, even the man who\u2019s dedicated his career to researching coeliac disease (the bona fide gluten allergy) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is in on the joke.\n\nThe main reason people get so irked by intolerance claimants is that, aside from being nightmare dinner guests, they also tend to be blundering self-diagnosers. \u201cOur research actually indicates that most people who have self-reported gluten sensitivity do not [actually have an intolerance] \u2014 only a minority do,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cThe situation isn\u2019t yes or no \u2014 but it\u2019s not as common as many believe.\u201d\n\nNobody is arguing that gluten has a particular effect on the gut, but, the problem is, one woman\u2019s carb bloat is another\u2019s intolerance. Indeed, terms like IBS, sensitivity and intolerance are broad concepts \u2014 ones that are easy to misuse and abuse. Or in Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s words, they become the \u201cnew cool eating disorder\u201d: an in-vogue way to kilojoule swerve or at least a cult claim to sit nicely alongside your green juice and smoothie bowl.\n\nBut recently, we\u2019ve noticed the breadbasket refusers and ingredient checkers aren\u2019t citing gluten. Instead, the word being mouthed to waitresses, suggested to GPs and written across wellness blogs is the slightly less catchy F-word, \u2018FODMAP\u2019.\n\nREAD MORE: 9 IBS Treatments That Will Free You From The Toilet Seat\n\nWhat the \u2018F\u2019 is FODMAP?\n\nThe acronym stands for \u2014 and heads-up, it\u2019s a mouthful \u2014 fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, which are present in everything from classic gut offenders, like dairy and bread, to healthy favourites, like avo, cashews and coconut water. Over the past couple of years, these carbohydrates have slowly poked their way into the wellness lexicon following research published mainly by Gibson and his team at Monash University in Australia. There, they found that a diet low in FODMAPs helped relieve IBS symptoms in 70 percent of sufferers. The Bulletproof Diet author Dave Asprey is a low-FODMAP advocate and FODMAPs have had their 15 minutes on The Dr Oz Show.\n\nSo why do they matter? Well, these prebiotic compounds are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and, so, pass undigested into the colon to be rapidly fermented by colonic bacteria. This is a totally natural process, but if you\u2019re prone to those IBS-type symptoms, the gas produced by these little bacterial critters can cause a world of tummy trouble, simply because, scientists believe, you\u2019ve got a bowel that\u2019s physiologically more sensitive to being stretched. \u201cAdditionally, colonic bacteria in people diagnosed with IBS may react more acutely to certain types of food, increasing the amount of gas produced and water content in the colon,\u201d says Dr Majella O\u2019Keeffe, a dietician who\u2019s investigating the effects of FODMAPs. Stress can make matters worse too.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the interesting bit: rather than simply being the latest intolerance to lay claim to, FODMAPs may have been at the root of those self-diagnosed conditions all along. Foods like pasta, cereals and biscuits made from wheat, that have been seen as big gluten culprits, also contain FODMAP compounds.\n\n\u201cWhen we began testing IBS sufferers, many of whom had diagnosed themselves as gluten-intolerant, we found that they didn\u2019t react to carbohydrate-depleted wheat, even though it still contained gluten,\u201d Gibson explains.\n\nAnd so the FODMAP-free movement has begun. Gibson and his colleagues have created an app, and the offshoot cookery book The Low Fodmap Diet Cookbook: 150 Simple, Flavorful, Gut-Friendly Recipes to Ease the Symptoms of IBS, Celiac Disease, Crohn\u2019s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, and Other Digestive Disorders (written by dietician Dr Sue Shepherd). In the US and Australia, you\u2019ll find FODMAP-free products, including soups, sauces, ready-made meals and protein bars.\n\n\u201cDemand has been steadily growing as word spreads about the diet and we just launched worldwide shipping in July to accommodate requests we\u2019ve had from the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among other countries,\u201d says US dietician Kate Watson, who developed her FODMAP-friendly Nicer Foods range in December last year after finding relief from 20 years of IBS symptoms on a low-FODMAP diet.\n\nREAD MORE: 18 Ways To Stop Feeling So Damn Bloated All The Time\n\nTrying a low-FODMAP diet is no easy task\n\nSo will we see restaurants offering FODMAP-free alternatives? Because if the statistics tell us anything, it\u2019s that there\u2019s a public appetite for restrictive diets. \u201cThe problem with a lot of these diets is people use them with the misbelief that it\u2019s going to solve all their problems,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s gluten or FODMAPs, we don\u2019t want people to stop consuming a particular food group because they think it\u2019s going to make them healthier. It\u2019s not always the case.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that can be made low-FODMAP, which are nutritionally bad, but if brands write \u2018low FODMAP\u2019 on them, it gives them a sort of credibility as a healthy food. We\u2019ve learnt a lot from the gluten-free explosion and we\u2019re trying to avoid too much exploitation of consumers for commercial gain.\u201d\n\nGibson is not selling the low-FODMAP diet as a lifestyle choice (in fact, he\u2019s also researching the benefits of a diet high in prebiotics) and is quick to point out it\u2019s simply unnecessary for anyone who doesn\u2019t suffer from IBS. But then, once upon a time, the same was said for gluten. Yet, it\u2019s transcended the IBS community, becoming a wellness mantra, shortcut to a flatter belly and catalyst to health utopia.\n\nSimilarly to non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, there is no definitive process for diagnosing a FODMAP-intolerance. \u201cAt the moment, there\u2019s no clinical test for FODMAP sensitivity,\u201d O\u2019Keeffe explains. Instead, candidates, under guidance from their doctor, go through a four to six-week elimination diet and then gradually reintroduce various high-FODMAP foods to identify individual triggers and work out tolerance thresholds.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the most common high FODMAP foods:\n\nVegetables: Asparagus, artichokes, onions, leeks, garlic, beans, lentils, chickpeas, sugar snap peas, beets, cabbage, celery, corn, avocado, cauliflower, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, fennel, okra, peas, shallot, radicchio\n\nAsparagus, artichokes, onions, leeks, garlic, beans, lentils, chickpeas, sugar snap peas, beets, cabbage, celery, corn, avocado, cauliflower, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, fennel, okra, peas, shallot, radicchio Fruits: Apples, pears, mango, watermelon, nectarines, peaches, plums, cherries,\n\nApples, pears, mango, watermelon, nectarines, peaches, plums, cherries, Dairy: Cow\u2019s milk, yogurt, soft cheese, cream, ice cream\n\nCow\u2019s milk, yogurt, soft cheese, cream, ice cream Grains: Rye, wheat, semolina, couscous, bulgur\n\nRye, wheat, semolina, couscous, bulgur Nuts: Cashews, pistachios\n\nCashews, pistachios Condiments: Honey, agave, relish, jam, tahini, tzatziki dip, hummus\n\nHoney, agave, relish, jam, tahini, tzatziki dip, hummus Food additives: Inulin, artificial sweeteners, high-fructose corn syrup\n\n\u201cRemember, though \u2014 this isn\u2019t as simple as just cutting out one thing,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cYou\u2019re cutting out a huge variety of foods, many of which \u2014 apples, garlic and broccoli \u2014 are low-kilojoule and very healthy.\u201d His point: this isn\u2019t exactly going to appeal to the carb-dodgers the way gluten does. In fact, the list of what to restrict runs across all food groups, from fruit and vegetables to healthy alternatives like agave syrup to hidden ingredients like the soy flour used in many chips, sausages and protein bars. It\u2019s enough to make a person nostalgic for the comparatively simple task of cutting out gluten.\n\nAlso, FODMAPs are growing in notoriety at a time when gut health \u2013 and the associated benefits of prebiotic foods \u2014 have become a major area of scientific research. Prebiotics feed the bacteria in the gut, creating a diverse ecosystem of microflora. Sounds a bit gross, but it\u2019s a good thing. An increasing breadth of research shows that gut diversity is linked to everything from a strong immune system and fast metabolism to clear skin and mental health.\n\n\u201cPrebiotics are mostly FODMAPs, so the theoretical risk is that by eliminating them or cutting down on them significantly, you\u2019re going to create an environment in your bowel where you won\u2019t have as many health-promoting microbiota,\u201d Gibson warns.\n\n?\n\nSo, if someone mentions they\u2019re thinking of going FODMAP-free, do them a favour and encourage them to see a GP, who can first rule out a condition like coeliac disease and point them in the direction of a dietician to supervise the tricky elimination stage.\n\nAlso, do yourself a fave: cross them off the guestlist for DIY pizza night.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "They definitely make you blow too", "authors": ["Women'S Health"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7631/f10bcc355fd34070878fdef71e683863.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
