Yes, already.\n\nAAA Travel analyzed its flight booking data from the last three years to pinpoint the best window to make your Thanksgiving and Christmas plans. And Sept. 25 \u2014 that\u2019s next Wednesday, or just two days after the first day of fall \u2014 marks the date to start looking for the best deals on Thanksgiving week flights. The following day (the 26th) is when travelers should start wrapping up their Christmas itineraries, as well.\n\nMost people are expected to book Thanksgiving flights between Sept. 25 and Oct. 27 \u2014 that\u2019s 28 to 60 days before the holiday feast falling on Nov. 28 this year, when the average airfare will hover around $491 roundtrip.\n\nBut those who don\u2019t mind flying by the seat of their pants can risk waiting until the last minute to get the lowest prices. Travelers who book just seven to 13 days before Turkey Day (or Nov. 11 through 17) can gobble up airfares at $482 on average. The problem with that strategy is that any remaining seats so close to the holiday could be few and far between \u2014 especially as delays in the return of the embattled Boeing 737 Max fleet grounds the number of available flights.\n\nAmerican Airlines AAL, -1.05% doesn\u2019t expect the Boeing BA, -0.51% aircraft to return to its schedule until Dec. 3 (translating to 140 canceled flights each day), Conde Nast Traveler reported, and United UAL, -0.90% says the Boeing 737 Max won\u2019t return to its operations until Dec. 19 (canceling roughly 2,800 flights in November and 1,700 in December). Southwest LUV, -2.05% pushed the aircraft off of its schedule until January 2020.\n\nSo, waiting too long runs the risk of not finding any flights before the holiday, at all \u2014 especially considering a record 112.5 million Americans traveled for the holidays by air, road and rail last year, per AAA\u2019s estimates.\n\n\u201cProcrastinating travelers may be able to find last-minute deals on flights close to the holidays, as airlines look to fill their last few remaining seats, but flight availability for these peak travel weeks will be very limited by that time,\u201d warned AAA Travel vice president Paula Twidale in a statement. \u201cHoliday travelers should make their plans now and begin booking their flights for Thanksgiving and Christmas as early as Wednesday, Sept. 25 for the best deals and availability.\u201d\n\nEven Christmas fliers should get moving now. While AAA found that most travelers wait until between Oct. 26 to Nov. 27 to start arranging their Christmas flights, it says that the real sweet spot to find bargains falls between Sept. 26 and Oct. 25, or 61 to 90 days before the Dec. 25 holiday. Prices will be lower on average at $551, compared to $561 for those who book a month later.\n\nAnd similar to the Thanksgiving, Yuletide revelers can also score the best prices ($488 on average) if they wait until a week or two before Christmas to book flights. But these procrastinators will also likely find a limited number of seats remaining, which means they could potentially not make it home in time for Christmas. Bah humbug, indeed.\n\nAAA also has some tips on the best days to go dashing through the airport.\n\nIf you want to reach your destination before Thanksgiving, then AAA says that the Monday before Thanksgiving (Nov. 25 this year) is the best overall day to fly. That\u2019s because it has the lowest average ticket price ($486) ahead of the holiday, and it is a lighter travel day than Tuesday (Nov. 26) or Wednesday (Nov. 27), which will be the busiest days \u2014 and with tickets averaging $521 and $527, respectively.\n\nFor travelers more worried about crowds than costs, flying the Sunday before Thanksgiving has the highest average ticket price ($564), but it is also consistently the lightest travel day.\n\nBut if running a little late to the Thanksgiving Day table isn\u2019t an issue, then flying on Thanksgiving itself has the lowest ticket price at $454.\n\nAs for Christmas, which falls on a Wednesday this year, brace for the weekend before (Saturday through Monday, Dec. 21 to 23) to see the worst travel days, as people typically fly two to four days before the holiday. And Sunday, Dec. 22 will be the busiest air travel day around Xmas, and the date that travelers pay the second-highest airfares of the week, at $639.\n\nSo AAA says that Christmas Eve on Tuesday, Dec. 24 will be the best overall day to fly, because it has the lowest ticket price ($527) and the least amount of other travelers.\n\nThe most expensive day to fly will actually be the day after Christmas, with Dec. 26 tickets averaging $692 roundtrip.", "description": "These are the exact dates to start searching for the best deals, and the best days to fly.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR587_holida_ZG_20190918165740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
