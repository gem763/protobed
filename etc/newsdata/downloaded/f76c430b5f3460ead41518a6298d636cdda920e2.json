Mr Trump's supporters argue that his corporation tax cuts along with his US-focused policies, his clampdown on bureaucracy and his promises of infrastructure investment have all helped.\n\nHowever, in recent months, the index has been highly volatile, reflecting worries about the trade confrontation with China, and a gloomier outlook for the global economy.\n\nJobs and wages\n\nSo, what's happening with employment and wages?\n\nIn his speech to the UN General Assembly, President Trump said unemployment was at its lowest for half a century. He also said that in the last three years, six million more Americans were now on the employment role.\n\nIn August this year, the unemployment rate was 3.7%. Fifty years ago in September 1969, the unemployment rate was the same - 3.7%.\n\nBut it did drop to 3.5% in November and December 1969 so that's actually the lowest point for fifty years.\n\nAs for the numbers in employment, it's true that over six million more were recorded as employed in August 2019 compared with August 2016.\n\nMr Trump has also highlighted record low levels of unemployment amongst specific groups.\n\n\"Last month, African American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment reached the lowest levels ever recorded,\" he said.\n\nIt's correct that going by data from 1972 onwards, unemployment for African Americans was at a record low in August - at 5.5%.\n\nUS official data for Hispanic workers goes back to 1973, and in August this year, unemployment was at 4.2% - that's also the lowest recorded level.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFor Asian Americans, records only go back to 2003. These show the unemployment rate last month was 2.8% - the lowest ever recorded was actually in June this year when it was 2.1%.\n\nIn all these groups, unemployment levels had been decreasing throughout the Obama years, after peaking around the time of the 2009 recession.\n\nPresident Trump also told the UN that \"wages are rising, incomes are soaring.\"\n\nThat's not the whole story.\n\nAverage hourly earnings growth did continue throughout 2018 - a generally upward trend which began during President Obama's administration.\n\nIt reached 3.4% in February this year, but then began slowing and is now at 3.23%.\n\nIn real terms after inflation is taken into account, wages increased by 1.5% between August 2018 and August 2019, according to official data.\n\nHousehold income has also been growing - but the rate of increase slowed in the last few years.\n\nIn 2018, median household income was $63,179, which official data says is not statistically different from the previous year.\n\nThis was reported to be the first year it had barely moved after three years of growth.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "description": "Is the US economy under President Trump the best it's ever been?", "authors": ["Reality Check Team", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DE4B/production/_107470965_trump_economy.png-nc.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
