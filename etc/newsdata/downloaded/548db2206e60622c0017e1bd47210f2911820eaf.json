For decades, there had been few laws to ensure the safety of Lebanese drivers and their passengers. Now, finally, in addition to seatbelt and car seat requirements, drivers had to have fire extinguishers at hand in case their cars ignited, which, it had been decided, was a real concern. I and other Lebanese citizens were struck by this sudden, endearing care for our safety. There were even some teary eyes.\n\nNow, four years later, Lebanon\u2019s roads are still chaotic , and, while many drivers now possess the indispensable small fire extinguisher s, the government, as was made all too clear earlier this week when Lebanon was swept by catastrophic flames from out-of-control wildfires, doesn\u2019t have the proper equipment to handle more urgent calamities.\n\nThe fires started on Monday night in the dense forests to the east and south of Beirut and then engulfed other regions to the north, reaching residential areas on their way and endangering houses, schools and small businesses, not to mention displacing hundreds of families. Aerial photographs show rows of charred cars and scorched streets.\n\nSome blamed the sudden temperature rise and the strong winds, others said the fires were the work of arsonists and a few even claimed they had been started by Syrians. But the crucial question is: Why did the Lebanese government fail to react in an efficient manner to contain the wildfires? And what were the cabinet members and the president doing that night, while citizens and firefighters from the Civil Defense, with limited technical capability, were desperately trying to put out the flames?", "description": "The Lebanese government\u2019s ineptitude has driven people to the streets.", "authors": ["Joumana Haddad"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/opinion/17Haddad/17Haddad-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
