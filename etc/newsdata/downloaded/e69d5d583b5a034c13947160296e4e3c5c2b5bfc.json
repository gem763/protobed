By the end of the month, crew members will have completed a total of five spacewalks. Most of their time outside will be spent making upgrades to the space station\u2019s power system.\n\nThe first of the five trips occurred over the weekend. Expedition 61 flight engineers Christina Koch and Andrew Morgan spent more than seven hours outside the International Space Station on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe two NASA astronauts began the replacement of nickel-hydrogen batteries with newer, more powerful lithium-ion batteries on the far end of the station\u2019s port truss,\u201d according to a NASA news release.\n\nThe new lithium-ion batteries are lighter and more energy efficient than than the old nickel-hydrogen batteries. Over the last several spacewalks, astronauts have worked to remove the old batteries and install the new ones.\n\nMorgan and Koch will continue their battery swap work later this week, on Oct. 11. The spacewalk will be broadcast live on NASA TV.\n\nAdditional spacewalks are scheduled for Oct. 16, 21 and 25.\n\nAstronauts conducted a similar battery swap in 2017. As more new batteries arrive and are installed, the old batteries will get shipped back to Earth for proper disposal.\n\nEarlier this year, astronauts prepared the truss for the several new batteries, the installation of which is expected to be completed by the end of the month. Sunday\u2019s spacewalk was the first of five scheduled for October.\n\n!function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement(\u2018iframe\u2019);t.display=\u2019none\u2019,t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document;c=n.createElement(\u2018script\u2019),c.src=\u2019//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js\u2019,c.setAttribute(\u2018async\u2019,\u20191\u2032),c.setAttribute(\u2018type\u2019,\u2019text/javascript\u2019),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document);\n\ncnx.cmd.push(function() {\n\ncnx({\n\nplayerId: \u201856098f0f-3e22-41b7-8dd5-b37443d7c53d\u2019\n\n, mediaId: \u201840576388-0358-4291-874f-89c705b233b9\u2019\n\n}).render(\u2018dc4af7523a4b45c5a91cb62f60e45102\u2019);\n\n});", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 October is spacewalk month for astronauts aboard the space station.
