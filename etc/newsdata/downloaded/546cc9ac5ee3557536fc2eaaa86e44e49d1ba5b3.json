May his soul Rest In Peace,\u201d Shamla Jeyarajah Subaraj revealed in a post on her Facebook account.\n\nSubaraj was the first eco-tourism guide to be licensed in Singapore back in the 1990s, and served as the director of wildlife consultancy firm Strix. For decades, he was the face of the city\u2019s environmental movement, from personally conducting field surveys to leading bird-watching tours.\n\n\u201cFor over 35 years, he worked relentlessly to preserve our flora and fauna,\u201d the admins of the Facebook group Ottercity wrote, crediting him for the return of Singapore\u2019s beloved otter population.\n\n\u201cAmong his many accomplishments and achievements, we will always remember and be thankful for Subaraj\u2019s hard work to save Sungei Buloh [Wetland Reserve] from redevelopment in the late 1980s. This same patch of mangrove later became ground zero for our returning otters in the 90s,\u201d they wrote.\n\nSubaraj personally drafted \u201ctwo important documents\u201d that led to the conservation of the reserve, minister Desmond Lee wrote in his tribute on Facebook. Lee is the minister for social and family development and second minister for national development.\n\nOne of them, known as the \u201cMaster Plan for the Conservation of Nature in Singapore,\u201d was published in 1990 and recommended a number of sites for conservation, including the Mandai mangrove recently opened to the public, Lee said.\n\nSubaraj also designed nature and wildlife survey methodologies still being used today, he added.\n\n\u201cBefore Googling became an easy source of finding information, Subaraj was the guru who could identify birds by their calls, and knew where they could be found,\u201d Lee wrote.\n\nSubaraj\u2019s passion for nature and wildlife sparked in 1981 when he took his first nature hike at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, according to the Wild Singapore website. He then spent much of the \u201980s wandering the natural habitats of Singapore and Malaysia before returning home.\n\nThe Singapore Tourism Board paid their own tribute yesterday by posting a video about him.\n\n\u201cIn memory of Subaraj Rajathurai \u2013 self-taught naturalist, wildlife expert and a Singaporean whose passion inspired us all. He will be missed,\u201d the caption reads.\n\nMore news from the Little Red Dot at Coconuts.co/Singapore.\n\nThis article, Singapore mourns veteran nature and wildlife conservationist Subaraj Rajathurai, originally appeared on Coconuts, Asia's leading alternative media company.
