Authorities are \u201cfishing to figure out who the nark [sic] is.\u201d\n\nParisi and Matthew Bojanowski, who was academic chairman of the class, have made explosive news nationally recently after alleging that they were bullied by superiors, grilled by their academic dean under police-like interrogation and then shunned by many of their fellow seminarians after going public with sexual harassment complaints about those up the chain of command. The Vatican on Thursday announced it is investigating broad allegations church leaders have mishandled clergy abuse cases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs striking as the charges is the fact that the men are speaking out at all. Parisi and Bojanowski \u2014 who both left seminary in August \u2014 are among a small but growing number of Catholic priests and seminarians who in the past year have gone to investigators, journalists and lawyers with complaints about their superiors. While still rare, such dissent has until now been nearly unheard of in a profession that requires vows of obedience to one\u2019s bishop and offers no right to recourse, no independent human resources department.\n\nPrompting the pushback, the men and experts on the U.S. church say, is what many Catholics view as the Catholic Church\u2019s unwillingness to respond frankly and transparently to recently revealed cases of sexual mistreatment of seminarians and priests. That, and the #MeToo moment, in which Americans have shown new willingness to speak out against adult sexual abuse and harassment.\n\n\u201cMy conscience bothered me. If it meant being thrown out, so be it,\u201d said Parisi, now 45, who joined the seminary in 2018 after 25 years as a member of a Catholic religious order, caring for the sick and dying. He thought he knew the church well when he entered seminary. Now living with his parents and unemployed, he has received hate mail, and says priests in his hometown won\u2019t acknowledge him. His faith in the institution has been \u201cshattered,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for exposing the truth.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his Aug. 15 resignation letter, Parisi urged other seminarians, if they have issues, to go to state officials or journalists.\n\nIn addition to Buffalo, young men wrestling with scandals in Washington, D.C., and West Virginia, among other places, have also weighed expectations of obedience against their desire for more accountability \u2014 and chosen the latter.\n\nMore than half a dozen priests and former seminarians were the key whistleblowers in the recent fall of West Virginia Bishop Michael Bransfield, a well-connected fundraiser and donator in the U.S. church. Two recently exited West Virginia seminarians have gone public with allegations that Bransfield sexually mistreated them and have sued. One, who has not been named, said he was assaulted. The other, Vincent DeGeorge, 30, said Bransfield kissed and groped him, and pressured him to sleep over and watch porn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBecause of the sex abuse crisis, I told myself going in [that] I wanted to be a priest, but I wasn\u2019t going to let myself be complicit in a corrupt institution,\u201d said DeGeorge, who left seminary last year after he says he was sexually harassed by his then-bishop, wrote an op-ed criticizing regional church leaders and quickly became a pariah.\n\n\u201cTo scrutinize a bishop is to attack the church, is to be a bad Catholic,\u201d DeGeorge said.\n\nSeveral current and former clergy members spoke out beginning last summer about their treatment by defrocked cardinal Theodore McCarrick, some by name and others anonymously. The Washington Post has received more calls from Catholic seminarians and clergy members with tips and concerns in the past year than in the previous decade.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had conversations in all the previous years like the ones I\u2019ve had in the past year. People feel they can finally talk about things\u201d among themselves, said a seminarian in the D.C. region who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears dismissal.\n\nSome said the expanding of a more aggressive Catholic media in the past couple of years has emboldened Catholics, including seminarians, to challenge the hierarchy.\n\nA power imbalance\n\nBut even as the scandals have spurred some to speak out, church culture and theology dissuade more from raising their voices.\n\nAD\n\nIn the Catholic Church, bishops are kings of their dioceses, and priests swear an oath of loyalty to them. Seminarians\u2019 pursuit of the priesthood rests completely with their superiors \u2014 the bishop in particular. There is no appeal or required explanation if one is deemed not to be priest material.\n\nAD\n\nSome seminarians described having their spiritual fitness scrutinized if they raised too many questions. They fear that criticizing a bishop or higher-up could get them removed from seminary.\n\nAn internal church report investigating allegations against Bransfield quotes one priest-secretary who was allegedly harassed as saying he was in seminary when the bishop first asked him to remove his shirt.\n\n\u201cHe stated that he did so out of fear. \u2018Your life is at the will and pleasure of the bishop when you\u2019re in seminary,\u2019 \u201d the man told the lay investigators last year, according to the report, which The Post obtained.\n\nAD\n\nIn an email on May 7, 2018, a diocesan official in West Virginia told DeGeorge that he must stay over with Bransfield for a week \u2014 even though the then-seminarian did not want to.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe request \u2026 was not actually a request. It was basically an expectation. You need to be there with the bishop during those dates,\u201d the email reads.\n\nThe guide for seminarians by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops encourages submissiveness.\n\n\u201cSeminaries should articulate that priestly obedience begins with humble and willing cooperation in seminary life, docility to direction and wholehearted compliance with the seminary\u2019s policies,\u201d it says.\n\nPriests, seminarians and former seminarians described in interviews a climate of self-censure, with men often tattling on one another and gossiping rather than speaking openly. And when they do speak up, they said church authorities often do nothing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey \u201csay the right things, how we encourage honesty and openness, but deep down it\u2019s clear they want to move on from [issues] as fast as possible,\u201d said Mike Kelsey, who was a seminarian in the D.C. Archdiocese from last summer until January when students were openly upset that more hadn\u2019t been done to learn what the past two archbishops \u2014 McCarrick and Donald Wuerl \u2014 did and knew regarding sexual misconduct.\n\nKelsey and other seminarians and priests interviewed for this article agreed that the problem lies in how the vows are interpreted and lived out within the church.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think obedience is bad,\u201d Kelsey said, noting that corporations also suffer from similar transparency problems. \u201cBut it\u2019s also not something I\u2019m signing up for if the hierarchy behaves in this way. If leadership and so many are not willing to get to basic levels of truth and justice, I\u2019m not willing to sit there and obey them. I think the church is deeply corrupt and broken.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuestions about how sexual misconduct in seminary is handled are considered so pressing that the University of Notre Dame last month released a first-of-its-kind study of 1500 seminarians on the topic. About 3,500 U.S. post-college men \u2014 who make up the vast majority of seminarians \u2014 were enrolled in programs in 2018-2019, according to Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate.\n\nSeventeen percent said sexual abuse or misconduct is a problem at their schools, the survey found. Asked whether their administrators take the issue seriously, 84 percent said \u201cvery,\u201d while 11 percent said somewhat or not at all. Of the 10 percent who said they have experienced, or may have experienced, sexual harassment, abuse or misconduct, 51 percent said they had not reported it. Of those who did, 42 percent said their reports were either \u201ccompletely\u201d taken seriously and acted upon or acted upon \u201cfor the most part.\u201d\n\nTo get the seminarians to talk, researchers offered anonymity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey are afraid they\u2019ll be judged as temporarily unfit, too assertive,\u201d John Cavadini, director of Notre Dame\u2019s McGrath Institute for Church Life, which crafted the new research, said about seminarians. \u201cThat\u2019s one aspect of seminary education you wouldn\u2019t have a close parallel of outside seminary. The bishop is a peculiar concentration of power in one person.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Carter Griffin, rector of the St. John Paul II Seminary in the D.C. Archdiocese, said that, if taught correctly, obedience to church authority can be a beautiful act, \u201cto follow the Lord through the word of another.\u201d\n\nBut younger men who grew up in the shadow of earlier abuse scandals know that automatically going \u201cinto protection mode\u201d isn\u2019t wise for the church, Griffin said. Regardless of what higher-ups do, he said, seminarians must do what\u2019s right.\n\n\u201c It might mean that people will misunderstand you, there may be consequences for your actions and you have to shoulder those,\u201d he said.\n\nShunning as punishment\n\nSpeaking out, especially for those who do not leave seminary or the priesthood, can be risky. Some seminarians report a lack of support from their classmates \u2014 even social shunning.\n\nAn unnamed seminarian who filed a lawsuit against the West Virginia diocese earlier this year alleging that Bransfield sexually assaulted him declined to comment for this article. But his mother told The Post that many priests \u201cwhom he called friends and brothers\u201d and many of his former fellow seminarians for the most part have kept their distance from him.\n\n\u201cThey feel they have to choose the church,\u201d she said. The Post isn\u2019t naming her to protect the anonymity of her son. The Post doesn\u2019t identify sexual assault victims without their permission.\n\nThe man and the Wheeling-Charleston Diocese reached an unspecified settlement over the summer.\n\nDeGeorge\u2019s allegation of sexual mistreatment by Bransfield became widely known recently when The Post reported it in a profile of William Lori, the Baltimore archbishop who led the investigation of Bransfield. He had already made waves for a seminarian \u2014 he was on leave \u2014 in December when he wrote a Baltimore Sun essay critical of Lori. Many priests and his former classmates still avoid him \u2014 or speak of him as a troublemaker, he said.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Sept. 13 in Ohio County, DeGeorge alleges that Bransfield, the diocese and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops did not rein in someone known as a harasser, leaving seminarians vulnerable.\n\nIn Buffalo, the priests whom Parisi and Bojanowski blew the whistle on were suspended for a few weeks and returned to ministry in June. Bishop Richard Malone issued a statement that seminarians who spoke out \u201care to be lauded for coming forward.\u201d Malone is accused of mishandling of sexual abuse and misconduct cases.\n\nAfter more than 20 years serving Catholic organizations, Parisi says he\u2019s looking for work outside the church.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be major reform \u2026 But in my view, that won\u2019t happen. The system is a very well-oiled machine,\u201d he said. The church hierarchy believes \u201cit doesn\u2019t need fixing in their view because it\u2019s running exactly the way they want it to.\u201d", "description": "\u201cMy conscience bothered me.
