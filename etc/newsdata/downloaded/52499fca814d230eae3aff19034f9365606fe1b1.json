(Image: Disney XD)\n\nLeave it to Star Wars to make you wait.\n\nLast week\u2019s premiere of Star Wars Resistance picked up right where things left off at the end of season one, but didn\u2019t answer the show\u2019s biggest lingering question. No, we had to wait until this week\u2019s second episode, \u201cA Quick Salvage Run,\u201d to find out if Resistance was going to tie-in with The Last Jedi, and boy did it ever.\n\nStar Wars Resistance season one ended with Kaz and the Colossus escaping Castilon and racing off to D\u2019Qar, home of a secret Resistance base, in hopes of meeting up and joining the fight. However, we knew from seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi that the Resistance had to flee D\u2019Qar and left nothing but a busted First Order Dreadnought in its wake.\n\nSo as Finn, Poe, Leia and the rest of the Resistance are off being chased by General Hux and the First Order, under the watchful eye of Rian Johnson, over on Disney XD the Colossus has shown up right behind them, missing the battle but seeing the aftermath.\n\nNo one is left on D\u2019Qar, but there is that Dreadnought Poe and the Resistance destroyed and, with it, hopefully, some supplies to help the Colossus on their journey. So Kaz and the Colossus crew go inside the destroyed Dreadnought, showing The Last Jedi story from a whole new perspective.\n\nShort of a live-action version of an animated character showing up in one of the big-screen films, this was Star Wars animation at its most exciting. An episode that touched right up against the movies, to the point where everything is perfectly lined up storywise. Consider the planning that takes.\n\nThe number of people who have to weigh in on a story, approve it, come up with the idea to link it up, make sure they look the same, make sure one isn\u2019t screwing up the other, etc. It\u2019s impressive, to say the least. \u201cMost impressive,\u201d even. So we wanted to talk to the people who behind it all about it.\n\n\u201cWe always ask [the Lucasfilm Story Group] questions about continuity,\u201d executive producer Athena Portillo told Kotaku when asked about the crossover. \u201cQuestions about like \u2018Can we have an opportunity to read the script?\u2019 \u2018No, you can\u2019t read the whole script.\u2019 \u2018Well, can we read a certain sequence of the script? \u2018Can you show us something?\u2019 I mean sometimes we have to go to their offices to see what it is that we\u2019re trying to tie in.\u201d\n\nIn addition to setting most of the episode in the remains of The Last Jedi, another, even more recent Star Wars movie gets referenced in this episode too. The item Kaz and his friends search for on the dreadnought is coaxium, the powerful substance central to the plot of Solo: A Star Wars Story (and Smuggler\u2019s Run in Galaxy\u2019s Edge.)\n\n\u201cWe got to see the design for the coaxial before Solo came out and we got to have a deep dive in terms of what that means,\u201d executive producer Brandon Auman added. \u201cIt\u2019s a juggling act, right? Trying to figure out how much we can kind of hint or tease or show [and] season two is gonna have a lot of Easter eggs. A lot of really cool things that tie into some of the other movies and I think it\u2019s just bigger and bolder than season one. Like it gets crazy.\u201d\n\nOf course though, as the episode wore on, things got even worse for everyone. Tam ratted Kaz out about his message. The First Order realised where the Colossus was and tracked them down and nearly destroyed them before the coaxium was salvaged and the Colossus was able to escape.\n\nAt the end of \u201cA Quick Salvage Run,\u201d we have a very good sense of the dire situation set up in season two of Resistance. The Colossus needs supplies. The First Order is on its tail. The events of The Last Jedi are happening simultaneously and, whether we see it or not, the myth of Luke Skywalker will begin to spread after his heroic victory on Crait. Then there\u2019s the real problem which is the immediate fallout between Tam\u2019s actions with the First Order and Kaz\u2019s time with the Resistance. To get those answers, we again went right to the source.\n\nOh snap! Elijah Wood\u2019s character, Jace, is part of the First Order! (Image: Disney XD)\n\n\u201cI think Tam is deeply, deeply hurt,\u201d Suzie McGrath, the voice of Tam, told Kotaku about her character\u2019s actions at the end of this episode. \u201cI think she\u2019s also a little bit scared of what she\u2019s gotten herself into. She\u2019s in completely new surroundings. She\u2019s left her home. She\u2019s left her job. She\u2019s left a father figure and brother figure and a family. So I feel she\u2019s reeling with anger towards them but also kind of missing them a little bit too because they\u2019re family.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Kaz is] questioning whether it happened. Not knowing but questioning,\u201d Christopher Sean, the voice of Kaz, told Kotaku. \u201cThe truth is he doesn\u2019t know but the [mindset] is \u2018What if?\u2019 And that\u2019s really the biggest teaser. There\u2019s a wonderful thing that [the writers] have done in drawing a definitive line in both characters and in both of their stories. So it\u2019s really amazing to watch the season unfold, to watch both character choices and to see the development of Kaz.\u201d", "description": "Leave it to Star Wars to make you wait.", "authors": ["Gita Jackson", "Luke Plunkett"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/jpwejrkkioqxncrhbrll.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
