Supplied\n\nNAB is tipping a 15.5-million-tonne wheat crop, down from 20 million tonnes in September, after hopes of a reasonable crop in Western Australia fizzled to about 6.2 million tonnes and growers in NSW started cutting crops for hay.\n\nRabobank predicts Australia to export about eight million tonnes of wheat, 3.9 million tonnes of barley and less than a million tonnes of canola. This would amount to a 15 per cent fall from last year\u2019s exports.\n\nGrainCorp port terminals on the east coast exported next to no grain in the past 12 months, when its trading and marketing arm suffered huge losses.\n\nHowever, the diminishing production forecasts put GrainCorp in line for a payout of more than $40 million in the first year of a deal with insurance giant Aon designed to smooth out cash flow and earnings.\n\nDr Kalisch Gordon said the drought meant Australian grain prices would stay high and at the above-average basis levels that have made it uncompetitive on international markets.\n\nThe cost of grain to feed livestock has put pressure on meat, milk and eggs prices, but Rabobank said grain prices were likely to be capped by the increased imports.\n\nRabobank is tipping the dollar to depreciate to 66\u00a2 against the greenback by September 2020 and make whatever Australian grain that is available more competitive in export markets.", "description": "Australia is on track to produce its smallest winter grain crop for more than a decade as tough times for farmers get even tougher, according to Rabobank.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b9dce7012fdd9b8a9a3dc35fd6ca91461501697a", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
