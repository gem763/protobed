Elizabeth Warren have demanded that Facebook remove Donald Trump campaign ads that make false claims.\n\nAfter Facebook refused to intervene saying that it's not a political gatekeeper, Warren paid for a fake political ad that claimed Zuckerberg and Facebook have endorsed President Trump. The ad states in the next sentence that it's not true.\n\n\"I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\" Zuckerberg said Thursday.\n\nHe argued that it should be for voters to decide on a candidate's truthfulness and whether that's important to them, and that the company's practices with respect to transparency and sources of political advertising are now more stringent than those of broadcast media.\n\nReuters reported in October 2018, citing sources, that Facebook executives briefly debated banning all political ads, which produce less than five per cent of the company's revenue.\n\nThe company rejected that idea because product managers were loath to leave advertising dollars on the table, and policy staffers argued that blocking political ads would favour incumbents and wealthy campaigners who can better afford television and print ads, the sources said.\n\n'I certainly worry about an erosion of truth'\n\nZuckerberg said that even if such a decision were taken, it would be problematic to draw that line, as the company would never ban issue-driven speech from private individuals and organizations.\n\n\"While I certainly worry about an erosion of truth, I worry about living in a world where you can only post things that tech companies decide to be 100 per cent true,\" he said.\n\nSome Facebook critics have pushed for the company to be regulated more like a broadcaster, with a more activist gatekeeper role to keep out divisive content.\n\nZuckerberg said the company has a number of indicators to determine whether content is harmful, and tries to stamp out that which might encourage or incite violence.\n\nFacebook has come under fire ahead of the next vote, given it was a critical conduit in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election for bogus accounts.\n\nAs documented in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the election, as well as testimony from Facebook officials, hundreds of accounts were created by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), located in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and believed linked to the Kremlin. The tens of thousand of posts from the IRA and similar accounts located in other foreign countries sought to roil the American electorate and generally favoured Republicans, U.S. intelligence officials found.\n\nAs well, Zuckerberg was forced to apologize for data privacy flaws after the tech company Cambridge Analytica was found to have harvested the information of millions of users, in service of political operators in both the U.S. ahead of the election and the United Kingdom as it prepared to vote on whether to stay in the European Union.\n\nHe did not address the privacy issues in his speech but pointed out that the majority of the IRA posts would have been \"permissible political discourse if voiced by Americans.\"\n\nThe key, Zuckerberg said, is to better identify fraudulent accounts or clusters of accounts. He said Facebook removes \"billions\" of fake accounts a year, mostly in a manner of minutes.\n\nAdmitting to \"unfortunate enforcement mistakes\" in the past, Zuckerberg promoted the company's planned independent oversight board for people to appeal Facebook content decisions.\n\nIn a Facebook blog post outlining the oversight board's planned role last month, the CEO said the board's decisions would be binding, \"even if I or anyone at Facebook disagrees with it.\"\n\n'New challenges' all the time\n\nIn addition to questions regarding partisan politics, Facebook has faced criticism for allowing autocrats to more easily spread propaganda, as well as over response times to take down posts and videos related to deadly acts of violence.\n\nZuckerberg said the company's artificial intelligence systems are getting better all the time at identifying content that falls within that definition, claiming that 99 per cent of potential terroristic content is flagged and removed before being seen by users.\n\nHe also said Facebook monitoring systems have helped alert first responders to people in potential danger from others or threatening self-harm.\n\n\"These are new challenges, and our responsibility is to build systems that can respond quickly,\" he said.\n\nThe challenges encompass dozens of countries and languages, but not China.\n\n\"We could never come to agreement on what it would take to operate there,\" he said.\n\nIn defending the company's open approach to political speech on its platforms, which include WhatsApp and Instagram, Zuckerberg also took a shot at the Chinese-owned TikTok, which has been accused of censoring content emanating from Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\"Is that the internet that we want?\" he said.\n\nZuckerberg is scheduled to appear next week before the House's financial services committee, where he is expected to be questioned about Facebook's plans to launch a digital currency.", "description": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that Facebook\u00a0will continue to be a platform that will carry political speech some users may find objectionable, framing his argument as a matter of free expression prevailing over censorship.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5324719.1571334469!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/facebook-politics.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
