Last week sadly, the print version of that once impressive magazine was closed down, another supposed victim of the digital revolution.\n\nMarie Claire magazine created the 101 Ideas fashion round up which gave a bite-size round-up of affordable clothes and was one its best features. But the magazine announced the end of its print edition last week and will become digital only (file image)\n\nBut hang on a minute. Might it be that it is not only digital that is taking a wrecking ball to the print landscape? Might it not also be that magazines are publishing less and less of what their readers honestly want? And the clue here is in the \u2018honestly\u2019.\n\nOne of the main attractions of that original Marie Claire was a fashion round-up called 101 Ideas. It was brilliant. It was stuffed with affordable clothes to buy and clever fashion tricks and it was what most people bought the magazine for, although they wouldn\u2019t admit that. They\u2019d say they bought it for a feature on female genital mutilation. 101 Ideas was killed off years ago but if I were starting a magazine I\u2019d bring it back to life immediately.\n\nMagazines have to strike a balance between content with aspirational lustre that readers think they ought to enjoy and stuff that genuinely interests them. I remember legendary Tatler editor Mark Boxer hiring cookery writer Elizabeth David so people could say that was why they read the magazine when we all knew what they really wanted was to pore over posh party pictures. Of course magazines also need to reflect their times which is why currently so many are filling their pages with fewer glossy products and replacing them with endless articles about woke initiatives.\n\nTo celebrate its 25th anniversary the magazine featured 25 women, including soccer player Megan Rapinoe and actress-comedian Lily Singh who are guaranteed to leave their mark on the next. The publication mastered the balance between aspirational lustre that readers think they ought to enjoy and stuff that genuinely interests them\n\nTo do otherwise would be to show yourself lethally out of touch, in particular with a younger readership preoccupied by climate change, the desire for diversity and the environmental challenges of materialism. Just look at the interest in the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s September Vogue.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t an appetite for magazines that help find a great new dress for your cousin\u2019s wedding. Or a pair of boots for winter. A print magazine which you can refer to again and again and vitally, discover, what the late GQ Editor Michael Vermeulen called \u2018neat s**t to buy\u2019 certainly deserves to exist. Yes, we can admire how an influencer teams her snakeskin boots with her Jacquard print overcoat on Instagram, and we can find vast amount of product on e-commerce sites, but they don\u2019t have the filter or resonance of editorial on a physical page.\n\nI once had to design an imaginary magazine at some corporate bonding exercise.\n\nVogue's September issue has proved extremely popular as today's younger readership are preoccupied by climate change and the desire for diversity. Magazines also need to reflect their times which is why currently so many are immersing themselves in endless articles about woke initiatives\n\nMy team came up with an outline for a weekly magazine filled with page upon page of clothes and clever styling tips. That was all it would have. It was unashamedly about shopping. I still think it was a good idea.\n\nFew magazines in the current landscape would feel comfortable being so unapologetically consumerist in content. But they could be missing a trick.\n\nDarn it \u2013 I\u2019m sick of my man\u2019s holey socks\n\nWe were getting dressed for dinner when I spotted the holes in David\u2019s socks. \u2018Those have got to go,\u2019 I said. \u2018Why?\u2019 he replied. \u2018They\u2019re riddled with holes.\u2019 \u2018So? Men don\u2019t mind such things,\u2019 he continued \u2013 presumably unaware that Paul Wolfowitz who lost his job as the head of the World Bank shortly after being caught in a Turkish mosque with his toes poking out.\n\n\u2018Well I mind. They look sordid.\u2019 I persevered. \u2018That\u2019s rich coming from someone who shuffles around the place in a housecoat,\u2019 was his rapier-like coup de grace.\n\nI think he was referring to my elegant dressing gown but whatever, he\u2019s certainly not a fan of it or many of my favourite clothes. Obviously they can\u2019t be put into the same disgusting category as his socks but I guess love is having to put up with someone\u2019s sartorial idiosyncrasies.\n\nOr are there couples out there who find everything in their partner\u2019s wardrobes a delight?\n\nI\u2019ve seen the future of TV \u2013 The Archers\n\nThe emerging trend in TV is bite-sized viewing, such as the BBC\u2019s State Of The Union written by Nick Hornby in ten-minute segments. Meanwhile in the US, Quibi an app that will stream specially commissioned dramas like this, is being lauded as the new Netflix.\n\nAt first I thought the short form idea was crazy. Who would feel satisfied by watching something so slight? But then I realised the format was just like The Archers \u2013 a tiny fictional fix that takes hardly any time out of your day but keeps you coming back for more. And look how long that\u2019s survived.\n\nA quick fix: Rosamund Pike and Chris O'Dowd star in the BBC series State Of The Union which delivers 10 minute long episodes\n\nIt\u2019s a PC nightmare at the museum\n\nWha is a museum? That was the question posed to bosses at a conference who were asked to vote on a motion that would enshrine \u2018championing human dignity, global equality and planetary well-being\u2019 in the definition of a museum\u2019s purpose.\n\nPhew! You\u2019d think they had enough to do simply maintaining them as cherished places filled with marvellous objects. Clearly the delegates felt the same as, rather than voting the motion through, they voted to postpone the decision for another three years. Talk about our indecision is final\u2026\n\n007\u2019s revealed my top holiday secret\n\nMexico City, Venice, Udaipur \u2013 all famous settings for Bond films. And now\u2026 Sapri. You might not know where that is. But I do. It\u2019s a small southern Italian seaside town near the holiday home of my oldest friends where I have eaten many a pizza since the age of ten. And it\u2019s where Daniel Craig et al have just been filming the new 007.\n\nOne of the region\u2019s delights is that tourism has been mainly confined to Italians. But after the release of No Time To Die the charms of this Mediterranean gem will go global. Bad news for my friends but no doubt a welcome economic boost this still primarily rural area.\n\nDaniel Craig, center, sips a drink during a break on the set of the latest James Bond movie 'No time to die' in Matera, southern Italy\n\nWrinkles? Just get your face liquefied!\n\nI know we are meant to be zen about our age, but let\u2019s face it there are wrinkles and there are wrinkles. So when I was having a photo taken the other day I suggested to the photographer that we apply my maxim of moving the lens further away for each decade of the subject\u2019s life. \u2018Not to worry\u2019, she replied, \u2018I\u2019ll just liquefy\u2019, which is apparently the latest Photoshopping technique. Sounds fantastic.\n\nI only hope I emerge as a pool of glory rather than a dirty puddle.", "description": "ALEXANDRA SHULMAN: Marie Claire magazine announced the end of its print edition last week and shows the market needs to strike a balance between aspirational lustre and stuff which interests them.", "authors": ["Alexandra Shulman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/15/00/18487912-0-image-a-52_1568504604183.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
