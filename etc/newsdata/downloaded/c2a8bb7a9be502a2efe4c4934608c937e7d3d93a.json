But they have yet to receive any answers from the Pentagon.\n\nThe inquiry is part of a broader, previously unreported probe into U.S. military expenditures at and around the Trump property in Scotland. According to a letter the panel sent to the Pentagon in June, the military has spent $11 million on fuel at the Prestwick Airport \u2014 the closest airport to Trump Turnberry \u2014 since October 2017, fuel that would be cheaper if purchased at a U.S. military base. The letter also cites a Guardian report that the airport provided cut-rate rooms and free rounds of golf at Turnberry for U.S. military members.\n\nTaken together, the incidents raise the possibility that the military has helped keep Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort afloat \u2014 the property lost $4.5 million in 2017, but revenue went up $3 million in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe Defense Department has not produced a single document in this investigation,\u201d said a senior Democratic aide on the oversight panel. \u201cThe committee will be forced to consider alternative steps if the Pentagon does not begin complying voluntarily in the coming days.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon, Air Force and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMorning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

Occasionally the plane stopped in the Azores and once in Sigonella, Italy, both of which have U.S. military sites, the person added.\n\nBut on this particular trip, the plane landed in Glasgow \u2014 a pitstop the five-man crew had never experienced in their dozens of trips to the Middle East. The location lacked a U.S. base and was dozens of miles away from the crew\u2019s overnight lodging at the Turnberry resort.\n\nHad the crew needed to make a stop in the U.K., Lakenheath Air Base is situated nearby in England. The layover might have been cheaper, too: the military gets billed at a higher rate for fuel at commercial airports.\n\nOne crew member was so struck by the choice of hotel \u2014 markedly different than the Marriotts and Hiltons the 176th maintenance squadron is used to \u2014 that he texted someone close to him and told him about the stay, sending a photo and noting that the crew\u2019s per diem allowance wasn\u2019t enough to cover food and drinks at the ritzy resort.\n\nThe revelation that an Air Force mission may have helped line the president\u2019s pockets comes days after Vice President Mike Pence was pressed about his decision to stay at Trump\u2019s property in Doonbeg, Ireland, despite its location hundreds of miles away from his meetings in Dublin. The Oversight Committee is also investigating Pence\u2019s stay at the resort.\n\nAccusations that Trump\u2019s properties are unfairly profiting off of his administration have dogged the president since entering office. Ethics officials and lawmakers have raised concerns about foreign officials staying at Trump hotels, and noted that Trump supporters and industry groups regularly throw bashes at Trump-owned locations. Trump is also considering hosting next year\u2019s Group of Seven gathering of world leaders at his Doral resort in Florida, a potential financial boon for the property, and has previously stayed at the Turnberry property.\n\nBut the potential involvement of the military takes the issue to a different level.\n\nA senior Air Force official who was previously stationed at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska \u2014 where the C-17 crew was based \u2014 said choosing to refuel in Glasgow and stay at a posh property a half hour away would be unusual for such a mission. Typically, the official said, air crews stay on a military base while in transit or at nearby lodgings \u201cunless all the hotels are booked or there is a Scottish sheep festival going on.\u201d\n\nThe official, who was not aware of the specific allegations, also said that the mid-level officers or senior enlisted airmen commonly responsible for identifying lodging for the personnel are notoriously frugal and try to stay where their government allowance covers the costs.\n\n\u201cMaster sergeants are cheap,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), notes that U.S. military expenditures at the airport \u201cappear to have increased substantially since the election.\u201d\n\nPrestwick Airport has long been debt-ridden. The Scottish government bought it in 2013 for \u00a31, but it has continued to lose money in the years since. In June, the government announced its intent to sell the airport, which the panel\u2019s letter described as \u201cintegral\u201d to the success of the Turnberry property, 30 miles away.\n\nBecause of that, the lawmakers argued that the spending at the airport \u2014 in addition to the spending at the Trump property \u2014 raises concerns about conflicts of interest and possible violations of the domestic emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits the president from receiving any compensation from the federal government other than his salary. After being elected, Trump chose not to fully divest himself from his business interests, choosing instead to put his holdings in a trust that he can receive money from at any time.\n\nThe letter asks the Pentagon for all communications between the Defense and State Departments related to \u201cper diem\u201d allowances in Scotland, as well as \u201call pre-audit flags related to air crew travel\u201d through the Prestwick Airport and Turnberry resort, \u201cor travel allowances beyond the normal allocations in the Defense Travel System.\u201d\n\nConnor O\u2019Brien contributed to this report.", "description": "Now the layover is part of a broader House inquiry into military spending at and around the Trump property.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand", "Bryan Bender"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f7/4a/1da21d8340ae8b3151418dc68792/20190906-trump-turnberry-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
