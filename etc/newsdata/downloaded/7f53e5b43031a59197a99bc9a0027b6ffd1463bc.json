These schools are often able to provide more specialist support.\n\nAlready the state sector is struggling to offer suitable provision for a growing number of SEND children, so Labour would have to make sure that these vulnerable pupils are not left behind.\n\nIn addition, imposing a 7 per cent quota of private school pupils on each university would be very difficult to carry out without infringing on their autonomy.\n\nIt also does not take into account the fact that disadvantaged students are educated at some private schools, which cover their fees.\n\nNot only would integrating private schools into the state sector create serious logistical challenges \u2013 including the movement of thousands of teachers and pupils \u2013 it would also cost billions of pounds.\n\nCurrently it is unclear where this additional cash would come from, or how the plans would be implemented \u2013 especially in the wake of a potential legal battle from private schools. Already sector leaders are saying the plans to seize assets could be challenged in the courts.\n\nAnd the plans still do not stop the fact that children in state schools across the country are faced with vastly different educational opportunities depending on their location or background.\n\nAffluent families will still be at an advantage. They can afford to buy expensive houses near to top schools, they can pay for private tutors for entrance tests for grammar schools, and they know the tricks for getting into socially selective faith schools.\n\nSo Labour\u2019s policy is likely to win over voters who are fed up with elite schools like Eton \u2013 and the politicians that come from there \u2013 but it is unlikely to be the panacea for all inequality in the system.", "description": "Labour has voted to integrate all private schools into the state sector if they get into power, with many party members warmly welcoming the plans to strip independent schools of their privileges and to force universities to limit their intake of privately educated students to 7 per cent.", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/22/12/angela-rayner-labour-conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
