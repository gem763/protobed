Not only do we lack the tools to do a proper job; as politicians, we risk not being seen as impartial, undermining the point of the exercise: to ensure that the Commission is seen by voters as legitimate.\n\nThe task we\u2019ve been given is an important one. As a newly elected member of Parliament, I\u2019m impressed by the effort to turn the vetting of the new Commission into a real democratic process. Our role makes every commissioner accountable to the people, and ensures each nominee is vetted for potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWe fulfilled this part of our mandate late last month, when we excluded two candidates \u2014 Romania\u2019s Rovana Plumb and Hungary's L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi \u2014 for their worrying conflicts of interest. These decisions, made by a clear majority, were well justified and necessary if the next Commission is to be held to the highest standards of ethics and transparency.\n\nAnd yet, as soon as these decisions were made, it was clear they would be interpreted another way. Sure enough, taking a tough stance opened us up to claims of political bias.\n\nAnyone who exercises a high executive or legislative function should be held to the same standard as commissioners.\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that critics and skeptics will try to cast doubt on the process. And the process with which we vet the Commission\u2019s candidates makes us vulnerable to these type of criticisms.\n\nMembers of the Legal Affairs Committee are expected to check that candidates\u2019 declarations of financial interest \u2014 a document designed by the European Commission \u2014 are accurate. But we haven\u2019t been equipped with the relevant tools to do so. Crucially, we have no investigative powers.\n\nThe risk, then, is that our checks are insufficient \u2014 or, more dangerously, that they turn into fights between various political groups.\n\nAdding to that uncertainty is the fact that some MEPs, even as they\u2019re supposed to be probing conflicts of interest, fall short of the standards we\u2019re trying to enforce on Commission candidates. Some MEPs, as shown by recent documents released by NGOs, have earnings from work outside of Parliament. This has the potential to be a problem.\n\nOutsourcing the vetting process to an outside body would not be an admission of weakness.\n\nThe result: Voters are left with the impression that we are not operating on the basis of solid, unbiased facts.\n\nWe urgently need to correct this situation. Lawmakers in the Parliament should concentrate on what they were elected to do: set stringent transparency criteria, define the standards for probes and set up sanctions for those who don\u2019t comply.\n\nBut we should leave the actual probe of who falls foul of these standards to an independent body with investigative powers.\n\nThis independent authority \u2014 which could be modeled on France\u2019s Haute Autorit\u00e9 pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique, for example \u2014 would be tasked with collecting the facts. Only then would MEPs consider the suitability of the candidates.\n\nThe body would check that Commission candidates do not have financial interests that would undermine the European collective interest. It should also evaluate commissioners\u2019 wealth before, during and after their mandates, in order to determine if any fraud could have taken place.\n\nThe mechanism should also be extended to scrutinize members of the European Parliament, as well as secretaries-general and directors-general of the other EU agencies and institutions. Anyone who exercises a high executive or legislative function should be held to the same standard as commissioners.\n\nIn addition to ensuring that decisions are made based on impartial facts, the scrutinizing body would also be in charge of imposing sanctions, and thereby ensure these too are impartial and not politically motivated.\n\nOutsourcing the vetting process to an outside body would not be an admission of weakness. Safeguarding the EU\u2019s ethics and standards should not be left to politicians. We will never be perceived to be neutral enough.\n\nSt\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 is a French member of the European Parliament for the Renew Europe group and a member of the Parliament\u2019s Committee on Legal Affairs.", "description": "The European Parliament needs help holding the Commission to the highest standards.", "authors": ["St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Emma Anderson", "Laura Kayali"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190916_EP-092467A_DLL_031-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
