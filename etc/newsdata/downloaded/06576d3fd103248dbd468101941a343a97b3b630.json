In the blue, there are more men than women.\n\nIt\u2019s a common refrain among the single: There just aren\u2019t enough available men or women in this city.\n\nIn many cases, it\u2019s true. On the west side of Washington, D.C., for example, there are 1.4 college educated women between ages 18 and 30 for every man of the same description.\n\nUsing detailed Census data from 2010 and 2011, TIME calculated the ratio of unmarried men to unmarried women for every region of the country for a variety of age groups. A majority of Americans marry someone with a similar level of education, so the map can also be filtered by college degree status.\n\nZoom in to see the difference in urban areas.\n\nFor more on how demographics and population affect dating, see an excerpt from Jon Birger\u2019s Date-onomics here.\n\nCorrection: The shades of blue on the map were originally reversed, so that lighter colors corresponded to higher ratios. Thanks to @poncie13 for the catch!\n\nSome of the geographic divisions in the original version of this map were also too small to be statistically significant. The figures have been recalculated using \u201cSuper Public Use Micro Areas\u201d and data from 2008-2011, before the lines were redrawn into smaller districts. (The overall impression of the map is largely the same.) Thanks to Amelia Showalter for catching this issue and assisting with the solution. This is why we open-source our methodology!", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-09-23-at-8-12-39-am.png"}
