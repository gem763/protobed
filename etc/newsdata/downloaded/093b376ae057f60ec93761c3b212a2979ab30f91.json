Interest on public debts paid by the Treasury in 2019 rose nearly 10 percent to $572.8 billion.\n\nThat handily surpassed the $409.4 billion in federal spending on Medicaid, the health insurance program covering scores of millions of low-income Americans.", "description": "America's budget deficit soared to nearly $1 trillion in the 2019 fiscal year as government borrowing swelled, the US Treasury announced Friday.
