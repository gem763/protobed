The lawmakers said they then issued a subpoena for her appearance and she complied.\n\nYovanovitch, according to a copy of her opening statement to lawmakers posted online by the Washington Post, said she was told by a senior State Department official about \"a concerted campaign against me\" and that Trump had pushed for her removal since the middle of last year even though the department believed \"I had done nothing wrong.\"\n\nShe also expressed alarm over damage to American diplomacy under Trump and warned about \"private interests\" circumventing \"professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good.\"\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate a domestic political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, and Biden's businessman son Hunter Biden.\n\nGiuliani has accused Yovanovitch of blocking efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Giuliani has said he provided information to both Trump and the State Department about Yovanovitch, who he suggested was biased against Trump.\n\nOn Friday, Giuliani said: \"I was doing it in my role as a defense lawyer\" for Trump.\n\nIn her statement, Yovanovitch said she did not know Giuliani's motives for attacking her but that his associates \"may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCAREER DIPLOMAT\n\nDemocrats have called her removal politically motivated.\n\n\"She's a brave woman,\" Democratic congressman Michael Quigley said of Yovanovitch during a break in the testimony.\n\nAccording to a White House summary, Trump in his call to Zelenskiy described Yovanovitch in this way: \"the woman was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news.\" Zelenskiy agreed with Trump that she was a \"bad ambassador\" and agreed to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe conversation occurred after Trump had withheld $391 million in congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine to help it deal with Russia-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\n\"Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\" Yovanovitch said in her statement.\n\nYovanovitch entered the Capitol building for the deposition wearing dark glasses and walked past a crowd of journalists without responding to questions.\n\nA career diplomat who also has served as U.S. ambassador to two other countries, Yovanovitch's stint as envoy in Kiev was cut short when she was recalled to Washington as Trump allies leveled unsubstantiated charges of disloyalty and other allegations against her.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable foreign ally to dig up dirt on a domestic rival for his own political benefit. Biden, the former U.S. vice president, is a leading Democratic contender for the right to face Trump in the November 2020 presidential election. Trump has denied he did anything wrong on the call.\n\nThe investigation of Trump could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against the president in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate, where the Republicans who control the chamber have shown little appetite for ousting the president.\n\nThe chairmen of the three committees leading the impeachment inquiry warned the administration against stonewalling. Any efforts to prevent witness cooperation will be deemed obstruction of Congress \"and an adverse inference may be drawn against the President on the underlying allegations of corruption and cover-up,\" they said in a statement.", "description": "The former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine on Friday told a House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump that he ousted her based on \"unfounded and false claims\" after she had come under attack by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
