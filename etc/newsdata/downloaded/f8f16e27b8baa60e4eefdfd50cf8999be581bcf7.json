It is not clear if the statement is intended merely to paper over continuing divisions or will lead to an end to the fighting by the respective surrogate forces.\n\nThe sudden fracture has increased the confusion in Washington\u2019s Gulf strategy, complicating its Iran policy. In addition to forcing changes in the Trump administration\u2019s approach to Yemen, including the possible division of the country, the split may also damage the standing of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in Washington.\n\nThe dispute in the south started soon after UAE announced two months ago that it was unilaterally pulling most of its troops out of Yemen after more than four years of fighting, leaving its chief coalition partner, Saudi Arabia, and indigenous Yemeni government forces to continue the war against the Houthis.\n\nIn mid-August, fighters from UAE-backed Southern separatist movement, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), seized power in Aden, ousting the forces backed by Saudi Arabia and led by President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Now living in exile, Hadi, who was overthrown by the Houthis in 2014, is still recognised by the UN as the legitimate ruler of Yemen. Saudi has threatened to react decisively against the STC to reinstate Hadi\u2019s rule.\n\nThe STC, and its precursors before its May 2017 formation, have long campaigned for the restoration of South Yemen\u2019s independence from the North, or at minimum a federal structure. The country was unified in 1990.\n\nThe eruption of fighting in the south has severely complicated UN efforts to start talks between the Houthis and the Yemen government.\n\nThe dispute means the Iranian-backed Houthis that control both Yemen\u2019s capital Sana\u2019a and the north of the country have found themselves under reduced military pressure .\n\nAt the same time it has become increasingly visible that the Saudis and UAE had different priorities in Yemen.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been intent on weakening the Houthi rebels in the north, fearing an Iranian presence on its own borders joining Yemen while the UAE\u2019s interests focus on ensuring the southern port of Aden does not come under Houthi control thereby imperilling shipping lanes through Bab al-Mandab, upon which Emirati interests depended heavily. The dominance of the STC in the south could be enough to achieve these UAE aims, but at the expense of splitting the country in two.", "description": "Divisions between the Middle East allies are threatening war between their surrogate armies", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a688cc7f549d41bc8aa29dc3a43f385aa79ea031/0_79_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9ab90246053f696a8e3ed8561ab2b095", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
