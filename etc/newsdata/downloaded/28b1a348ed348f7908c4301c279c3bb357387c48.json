The company failed to secure permission from the local authority in India to use this frequency band, which the nation has yet to open for commercial usage, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. You may remember that in the U.S., the FCC approved the commercial usage of Soli earlier this year.\n\nIn a statement, a Google spokesperson said, \u201cGoogle has a wide range of products that we make available in different regions around the world. We determine availability based on a variety of factors, including local trends, and product features. We decided not to make Pixel 4 available in India. We remain committed to our current Pixel phones and look forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India.\u201d\n\nThe radar sensors on the new Pixel smartphones enable support for a number of human interactions, Sabrina Ellis, VP of Product Management at Google, said at the event today. \u201cFor instance, Pixel 4 has the fastest secure face unlock on a smartphone, because the process starts before you have even picked up the smartphone,\u201d she claimed. \u201cMotion sense prepares the camera when you reach for your Pixel 4, so you don\u2019t need to tap the screen,\u201d she added.\n\nThe radar sensor also enables other applications such as rejecting a call by just gesturing at the phone, Ellis said.\n\nThis is the first time Google has had to skip the launch of a phone in India, the second largest smartphone market and where all the Nexus and Pixel smartphones have launched a few days after their global unveiling.\n\nNot launching the new Pixel smartphones won\u2019t really hurt the company\u2026 at least financially speaking. The Pixel smartphones have failed to receive any substantial acceptance in the Indian market, especially as their prices increased over the years.\n\nEven as 99% of smartphones shipped in India last year ran Android mobile operating system, the vast majority of handsets carried a price tag of $200 or lower, research firm Counterpoint told TechCrunch.", "description": "The Pixel 4 and Pixel XL smartphones, that Google just unveiled at a press conference in New York, won\u2019t launch in India, one of the company\u2019s key overseas markets, the Android-maker said on Tuesday.
