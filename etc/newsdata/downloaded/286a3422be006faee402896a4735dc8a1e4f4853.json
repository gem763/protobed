(AP) - The organization behind the annual reenactments of the Civil War battle of Gettysburg says it doesn\u2019t plan on hosting such an event in the summer of 2020.\n\nThe Gettysburg Anniversary Committee said in a post on its website that after a quarter century of organizing the annual July observance, at this time it \u201cdoes not anticipate organizing or hosting a 157th reenactment.\u201d\n\nOperations Manager Randy Phiel told the Gettysburg Times that he considers the decision more as \u201chitting the pause button\u201d rather than the end, citing several factors that led to the decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well-known fact that the hobby is declining somewhat due to the age demographic of the reenactors and varied visitor interest,\u201d Phiel said. \u201cAlso, outdoor weather-related events come with their own set of dynamics.\u201d\n\nPhiel told The (Hanover) Evening Sun that the trend shows that reenactments are most successful every five years -the 100th anniversary, for example, hosted 1,100 reenactors and 60,000 visitors while the 125th anniversary hosted 2,000 reenactors. He said it\u2019s his hope that spreading the reenactment out would help build anticipation and grow visitor interest, but there are no definite plans to do that.\n\nThe committee has annually hosted three- or four-day reenactments on farms in Freedom or Cumberland townships, including encampments, battle reenactments, sutlers (civilians who sell provisions to the troops), living history presentations, and education programs.\n\nThe announcement offered thanks to all of the reenactors, visitors, and local staff that have participated in the in the annual events \u201cmaking those dusty old history books come alive.\u201d\n\nNorris Flowers, president of Destination Gettysburg, said living history encampments separate from the anniversary committee\u2019s event are regularly hosted by the Gettysburg National Military Park, Shriver House and Gettysburg Heritage Museum. He said he was sorry to hear about the committee but didn\u2019t think it would affect local tourism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be missed but a few years ago when we had the rainout, people realized there was still things to do here. We still have a great product here, it\u2019s just going to be different,\u201d Flowers told the Gettysburg Times.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The organization behind the annual reenactments of the Civil War battle of Gettysburg says it doesn't plan on hosting such an event in the summer of 2020.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2016/08/27/exchange_historical_re-enacting_costs_c0-135-3245-2027_s1770x1032.jpeg?2df2c1851862610eb9434980bcae70e608a08e1e"}
