It also says there is \u201cno proof\u201d that carbon dioxide is a major driver of climate change.\n\nThere are signatories from the Cato Institute and Heartland Institute in the US, which are part of the Koch-funded Atlas Network. UK-based free-market organisations such as the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), Adam Smith Institute (ASI), and Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance also belong to the network.\n\nMatthew Elliot \u2013 who is now reported to be advising Chancellor Sajid Javid \u2013 founded Taxpayer\u2019s Alliance. An old employee of Taxpayer\u2019s Alliance, Chloe Westley, has also joined Mr Johnson\u2019s team at No 10. Liz Truss has appointed two special advisors from the IEA and ASI.\n\nThe UK\u2019s main climate denial group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), founded by former chancellor Nigel Lawson, is well represented on the list.\n\nThe group\u2019s \u201curgent message\u201d is that the EU net-zero carbon goal \u2013 a policy that was blocked by Poland and three other member states in June \u2013 should be \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no climate emergency and therefore no cause for panic and alarm ... Our advice to political leaders is that science should aim at significantly better understanding the climate system while politics should focus on minimising potential climate damage,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nRobert Brulle, professor of sociology at Drexel University and an expert on climate science denial, told DeSmog it looked like a panicked response to the significant media coverage on the climate crisis after influential protests by Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg.\n\n\u201cThe talking points are stale and patently scientific nonsense. That isn\u2019t critical. The point would be to keep the \u2018contested\u2019 nature of climate change alive,\u201d he said.\n\nGeoffrey Supran, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, said he thought the move was an attempt to distract efforts to increase action at the UN Climate Action Summit at the end of the month.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs always, they presumably hope to muddy the waters of public and political discourse on the climate crisis \u2013 to feed the echo chamber of sympathetic right-wing media and blogs, and to prey on naive and unsuspecting journalists who may be tempted to exercise false balance in their climate coverage.\u201d\n\nThe campaign is being run by a Netherlands-based climate science denial group called the Climate Intelligence Foundation (Clintel). It was founded by Guus Berkhout who began his career at Shell and set up the Delphi Consortium in the 1980s to work on new ways to extract oil and gas. He says there are \u201ca lot of great names on the list\u201d and that they all give a \u201cvaluable contribution to the climate debate\u201d.\n\nOne signatory is Northumbria University\u2019s Professor Valentina Zharkova, who gave a lecture last year saying climate change is caused by solar cycles. She co-authored a paper on the subject that was published in June and criticised for containing \u201cbasic errors\u201d. The journal launched an investigation into how it was published.\n\nOther signatories of the letter include directors and former directors of oil and gas companies as well as five fellows of the Geological Society of London, a professional body that represents Earth scientists.\n\nThe letter also coincides with government meetings in Germany on 20 September on how the country will meet its 2030 emissions target.\n\nMr Berkhout confirmed the letter was real. He told The Independent: \u201cThe initiative aims at a lot more than providing a declaration. We will reveal our ambitions and plans in a series of press conferences in Europe, starting in Brussels, Oslo and Rome.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of climate change deniers including academics, politicians and lobbyists are to launch\u00a0a campaign to stop\u00a0commitments to net zero carbon emissions being enshrined in law, The Independent can reveal.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/02/19/boris-johnson-cabinet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
