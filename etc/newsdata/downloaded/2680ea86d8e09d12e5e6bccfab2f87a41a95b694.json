George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden\u2019s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition. Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden\u2019s office, he was told the then-vice president didn\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony. \u2026 The Washington Post has previously reported that there had been discussions among Biden\u2019s advisers about whether his son\u2019s Ukraine work would be perceived as a conflict of interest, and that one former adviser had been concerned enough to mention it to Biden, though the conversation was brief.\n\nKent\u2019s comments came during his closed-door deposition in the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe on Tuesday.\n\nWhen Kent raised his concerns about Burisma, the Obama administration had already cleared Hunter to serve on the company\u2019s board of directors. Hunter joined Burisma\u2019s board of directors in 2014. The former vice president was leading U.S. efforts to crack down on corruption at the time.\n\nThe State official explicitly warned the Obama administration that Burisma was \u201ccorrupt,\u201d NBC News revealed near the end of its article on Kent\u2019s testimony, noting:\n\nDuring his nearly 10 hours of testimony, Kent also told members of Congress and their staff that Burisma, the energy company where Hunter Biden was a board member, was corrupt, according to a separate person who was present in the room. Kent said he told the Obama administration in 2016 that they should not hold an event with Burisma because of the company\u2019s extensive corruption in Ukraine.\n\nIn the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that triggered the impeachment probe, Trump urged his counterpart to investigate corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAs vice president, Biden threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to force the Eastern European country to fire its top prosecutor in 2016, who had investigated the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, for possible corruption.\n\nHunter had been serving on the board of Burisma for up to $83,000 per month at the time despite having no background in energy, prompting allegations of corruption. He admitted to ABC News last weekend that his father\u2019s political position helped him secure the lucrative appointment to Burisma\u2019s board of directors.\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d allegation that during the July 25 call Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens by withholding aid triggered the impeachment probe. Trump and Ukraine have denied the allegations.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe is primarily seeking to determine whether Trump withheld aid to Ukraine in a bid to get dirt on White House hopeful Biden. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the probe, has said, however, that there does not need to be a quid pro quo to impeach Trump.", "description": "The Obama administration dismissed warnings that the Ukrainian company that was employing Hunter Biden was corrupt, the Washington Post confirmed.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Barack-Obama-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
