[Photo/Agencies]\n\nViolent clashes sparked by arrest of Catalan separatist leaders cause $2.8 million in losses\n\nAfter violent confrontations between protesters and police in a week of pro-independence demonstrations against the jailing of Catalan separatist leaders left hundreds injured, Barcelona has returned to relative calm, but the flare-up of anger still burns with both sides pointing the finger of blame.\n\nProtests began on Oct 14 after Spain's Supreme Court announced its decision to sentence nine separatist leaders to prison for their role in the illegal attempt to break away from Spain in 2017.\n\nAmid a general strike on Friday, there were more than 500,000 pro-independence protesters in the streets ahead of the most turbulent night of conflict. As onlookers applauded, some chanted: \"Freedom for political prisoners.\"\n\nSkirmishes had broken out, while masked youths blocked roads with blazing litter bins and hurled gasoline bombs, chunks of pavement, firecrackers and acid at police after surrounding their headquarters.\n\nPolice struggled to manage the situation, striking with batons and firing rubber bullets, and using tear gas and water cannons against the demonstrators.\n\nAfter the unprecedented violence, the government has said it now has the situation under control.\n\nThe independence movement was organized through a platform called Democratic Tsunami, which uses social media to mobilize supporters. On Friday, Spain's High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, ordered the Civil Guard, a law enforcement agency, to close down the group's webpages and social media accounts.\n\nReports indicate that 288 police officers were injured in the violence over the weekend, and overall, nearly 600 people have been injured in the clashes since the protests started.\n\nIn all, 194 people were arrested, 70 of whom had been brought before a judge. City officials estimate that close to \u20ac2.5 million ($2.8 million) worth of damage was caused during the week of chaos.\n\nBarcelona Mayor Ada Colau said on Sunday a policeman and a protester remain in a critical condition, adding that \"several people\" had been blinded in one eye by rubber bullets fired by police.\n\nColau said that Friday's violence had been the worst so far, and called on protesters to calm down, saying: \"This cannot continue. Barcelona does not deserve it.\"\n\nThe leader of the Spanish opposition pro-unionist party Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, has demanded Madrid impose direct rule on Catalonia, as he led a pro-Spain counterdemonstration in the city on Sunday.\n\nRivera, one of the most prominent anti-independence figures, told hundreds of flag-waving supporters that Spain's acting socialist government was not doing enough to end the chaos.\n\n\"People can't take their children to school, they can't open their businesses,\" said Barcelona-born Rivera. \"We need a Spanish government that protects the weak.\"\n\nRetiree and pro-Spain protester Roberto Salas told AFP at the Ciudadanos rally: \"Separatists are savages... the government must act because what is happening is a disgrace.\"\n\nIndependence is a highly divisive issue in Catalonia, which is Spain's wealthiest region and has 7.5 million inhabitants. AFP reported that a poll published in July by a public Catalan institute showed support for an independent Catalonia at its lowest level in two years, with 48.3 percent of people against and 44 percent in favor.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters at the pro-Spain rally, Martina Gonzalez, a 58-year-old cleaner who had a Spanish flag draped over her shoulders, said: \"There are more of us Catalan Spaniards than separatists-it's important that people see that not everyone is in favor of independence,\"\n\nAnother, 54-year-old Angel Rodriguez, said he had never witnessed the unrest that has rocked Spain's second largest city.\n\n\"These young people have been indoctrinated. They can't explain why they want independence because they don't know the history,\" he said.\n\nDespite the city's mayor pleading for restraint, and efforts from older protesters to prevent street battles by forming blocks between police and the younger activists, violence eventually erupted again on Saturday night.\n\nThis led Catalonia's president Quim Torra to ask again for discussions with Madrid to find a \"democratic solution\" to the crisis. He insisted the unprecedented unrest did not reflect the peaceful nature of the Catalan independence movement.\n\nSpain's caretaker prime minister, Pedro Sanchez of the Socialist Party was in Barcelona on Monday to visit the injured police officers, but refused to speak with Torra until he \"unequivocally condemns the violent behavior that has taken place in several parts of Catalonia, sometimes even not far from his own office\".", "description": "After violent confrontations between protesters and police in a week of pro-independence demonstrations against the jailing of Catalan separatist leaders left hundreds injured, Barcelona has returned to relative calm, but the flare-up of anger still burns with both sides pointing the finger of blame.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db104b7a310cf3e97a2b306.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
