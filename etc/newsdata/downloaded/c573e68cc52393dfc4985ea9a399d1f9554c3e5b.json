Jackson Hole is an academic conference and not the appropriate forum to announce a change in policy,\u201d TD Securities wrote in a note Friday. \u201cThe Committee is also divided on the outlook for rates and the impact of weak global growth and trade uncertainty on the US remains uncertain.\u201d\n\nUBS economists agree. \u201cGiven the July decision, when the cut was only 25bps and Powell seemed unable to lead the FOMC to a bigger cut, the risk of any speech disappointing market expectations for dovishness is high.\u201d\n\nPowell\u2019s speech comes on the heels of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) release of its July meeting minutes on Wednesday afternoon. The minutes revealed that most Fed officials viewed the July rate cut as a mid-cycle adjustment as opposed to the beginning of a long-term easing campaign. At the end of the most recent FOMC meeting, the committee cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, and markets are expecting more cuts ahead. With current risks weighing on the U.S. economy, Fed officials stressed the need for policy flexibility. Two FOMC members dissented from the Fed\u2019s latest rate-cut decision and felt that no rate cut was needed at the time.\n\n\u201cWe will hopefully get more clarity on future rate cuts when Powell speaks on Friday but, at this point, there is little sign that the Fed is willing to push back on the markets. As such, another 25bp cut in September still looks like a good bet, if only because the Fed will not want to disappoint lofty market expectations.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
