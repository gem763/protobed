In fact, it\u2019s something most of us will have to do at least once in our lives.\n\nBut anyone eating food on public transport should be mindful of those around them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering this, these are the most important things to keep in mind when eating on buses and tubes.\n\nDo be aware of allergies\n\nThis is the single most important factor \u2013 especially in light of the tragic food allergy deaths that have been in the headlines over recent months.\n\nIt\u2019s now best practice for airlines to ask customers to refrain from eating nuts in case anyone has an allergy on board. The same should apply on buses and trains \u2013 particularly due to the fact that personal space doesn\u2019t exist during rush hour. So anyone with an airborne allergy is seriously at risk.\n\nFood allergies can be both life-threatening and life-altering, so best to avoid some of the most common culprits on public transport \u2013 aka nuts, shellfish and fish.\n\nYou never know who you are sitting next to, after all.\n\nDo avoid stinky food\n\nSushi, eggs, smoked salmon, camembert and mackerel p\u00e2t\u00e9 are all big no-nos.\n\nAny food that has a pungent smell should not be consumed in closed-off areas like a tube carriage or bus. It\u2019s just inconsiderate for fellow passengers and it\u2019s likely the smell will linger around, even after you get off at your stop.\n\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that most hot foods will also have strong aromas. So while your post-night out doner kebab might smell like heaven to you, the rest of your carriage might disagree.\n\nIf you have to eat on the tube, opt for something cold that has little or no aroma.\n\nBurgers smell and have potential to spurt juice (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nDon\u2019t litter\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one wants to find a pile of chicken bones on the Northern Line \u2013 so be mindful of the type of food you\u2019re eating and how you\u2019re going to dispose of it when you\u2019re finished.\n\nAccording to TfL, drinking alcohol on the tube is not allowed \u2013 but if you decide to pull a Diane Abbott, be sure to take your tinnies with you. The same goes for fizzy drink cans and cartons.\n\nDo think about logistics\n\nWe\u2019ve already covered smell but there are plenty of other logistical factors to consider when it comes to food on public transport.\n\nAnything that has the potential to splash on fellow travellers must be avoided \u2013 so that\u2019s noodles and any kind of spaghetti ruled out.\n\nAny fruits with peel or a core are likely to be troublesome once feasting has finished. Everyone knows that holding on to a browning banana skin for seven stops is bad tube etiquette.\n\nOpt for snacks that are quick to eat and create very little mess.\n\nDo carry a napkin\n\nEating can be a messy business, especially when crumbly croissants are concerned.\n\nIf you know you\u2019re going to be eating on the tube, take a napkin or tissues with you. Any unexpected spillages or crumbs can be cleaned up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t be noisy\n\nNot everyone enjoys watching ASMR food videos in their free time.\n\nCrunchy and slurpy foods are likely to get on commuter\u2019s nerves \u2013 so hold fire on the nuts, crisps and soups. And sucking each finger after eating a packet of cheesy Doritos is terrible tube behaviour.\n\nYou may not be at the dinner table but it\u2019s always best to remember your manners \u2013 so eat with a closed mouth. This will help keep noise to a minimum. Unless, that is, you want the entire tube carriage to see the ingredients of your cereal bar make their way around your gob.\n\nSandwiches, salads and chocolate are great examples of some quieter foods.\n\nMORE: Pasta lovers assemble as London finally gets its very own Italian food hall\n\nMORE: I\u2019ve created a label to stop you from chucking good food away\n\nMORE: George the cat becomes a star thanks to his solo adventures on buses and trains\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "It's likely everyone will have to eat on the bus or tube at some point - here are the main dos and don'ts to remember.", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89246185_1570712173.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
