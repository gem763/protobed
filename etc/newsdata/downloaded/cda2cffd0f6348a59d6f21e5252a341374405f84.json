REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri\n\nLocal authorities barred AB InBev, the world\u2019s largest brewer, in July from selling its beer in the high profile New Delhi market for evading taxes. The company has denied the allegations and appealed the order.\n\nThe Delhi ban followed an investigation by city authorities which found that beer maker SABMiller - acquired by AB InBev in 2016 for around $100 billion - used duplicate barcodes on its beer bottles supplied to city retailers that year, allowing it to pay lower taxes.\n\nThe Delhi government\u2019s ban order had also called for further action against the company and a local bar outlet for alleged violation of criminal law provisions such as conspiracy, cheating and forgery.\n\nA senior Delhi police official, Anant Kumar Gunjan, told Reuters that officers have launched an investigation into the case after receiving a request from the city government, a move that could potentially lead to criminal charges.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating this, it is under inquiry,\u201d said Gunjan, adding that police would conduct its own probe before registering a formal case.\n\nAB InBev told Reuters in a statement on Friday that it was aware of the \u201cpotential for an additional authority to take interest in allegations\u201d raised in the Delhi government\u2019s ban order.\n\n\u201cIt would not be appropriate to comment further at this time. We are committed to operating with integrity and high ethical standards,\u201d a spokesman said, adding that the allegations dated back to 2016, before its takeover of SABMiller.\n\n\u201cBIGGER HEADACHE\u201d\n\nNews of the police investigation will add to the company\u2019s woes in New Delhi, where it is already arguing against the ban order with city authorities and in court. Separately, AB InBev is also battling an Indian antitrust watchdog investigation concerning alleged beer price-fixing by SABMiller and others.\n\n\u201cThe ban only has a financial impact, the police case could be a much bigger headache for the company and can have wider ramifications,\u201d said Sandeep Chilana, a New Delhi-based lawyer specializing in taxation and liquor laws.\n\nThe Delhi administration made a written request to police authorities last month to register a case, according to a government document dated Sept. 6, seen by Reuters on Friday.\n\n\u201cConsidering the gravity of the offence, it is opined that even a harsher and exemplary punishment (than the ban) ... would have also been justified in this case,\u201d the document said.\n\nAB InBev, which sells popular beer brands such as Budweiser and Hoegaarden, is the second biggest player in India\u2019s $7 billion beer market, accounting for a 17.5% market share, according to research firm IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.", "description": "Police in India's capital New Delhi are probing a case of alleged tax evasion involving Anheuser-Busch InBev, according to a police officer and a document seen by Reuters, a setback for the brewer already battling a three-year city ban.", "authors": ["Aditya Kalra", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429417574&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0ZO", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
