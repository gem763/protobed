I am disappointed we are losing Sandown (as an enduro) because we all grew up as kids watching the 500.\n\n\u201cI think it is important for our category as a form guide leading into the biggest event of the year (having the 500 before Bathurst).\n\n\u201cFor an entertainment point of view it is important to have those aspects in our category.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["James Mckern"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c214f7834b6a1418c9ec0e72f656ebe9", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
