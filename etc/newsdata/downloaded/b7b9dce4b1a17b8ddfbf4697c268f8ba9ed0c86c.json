I was around 18 at the time,\u201d longtime accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre wrote in the Florida court docs.\n\n\u201cEpstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\u201d Giuffre said in the Post article. \u201cThe other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d\n\n\u201cEpstein laughed about the fact they couldn\u2019t really communicate, saying that they are the \u2018easiest\u2019 girls to get along with,\u201d Giuffre said.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dispatches\u2019 will prove Andrew met Epstein at least 10 times during their 12-year friendship and the royal sometimes stayed with him for several days, according to the Times,\u201d the Post reported.\n\nEpstein, who committed suicide last summer in a Manhattan jail cell, saw Prince Andrew as his most valuable \u201ctrophy\u201d of the high-profile people he liked \u201ccollecting,\u201d socialite Lady Victoria Hervey said in the documentary titled, \u201cThe Prince and the Pedophile.\u201d\n\nThe Times is cited as the source in the Post report on \u201cDispatches\u201d obtaining Giuffre\u2019s medical records that confirm her abuse claims, including vaginal bleeding that lasted for weeks.\n\n\u201cWithout going into the details of the sexual activities I was forced to endure, there were times when I was physically abused to the point that I remember fearfully thinking that I didn\u2019t know whether I was going to survive,\u201d Giuffre wrote in a legal statement from 2015, according to the Times.\n\n\u201cAt no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction,\u201d Prince Andrew has said.\n\n\u201cBuckingham Palace has also said that \u2018any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue,\u2019\u201d the Post reported.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "A documentary aired in the UK on Monday includes claims that Prince Andrew took part in one of Jeffrey Epstein's orgies with underage girls.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1161385208-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
