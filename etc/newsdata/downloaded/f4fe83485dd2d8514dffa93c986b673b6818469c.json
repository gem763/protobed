He does drop out of the Test squad for these two Test matches in New Zealand, which are not part of the Test Championship, and I predict he\u2019ll come back stronger having had a bit of time away from the Test set-up.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not rested, he drops out of the Test team, but it\u2019s an opportunity for Jonny after a very busy summer, very hectic schedule, to reset, to work on one or two things and to come back stronger. My prediction is he comes back very strongly.\u201d\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nSmith, who is travelling to Leeds on Wednesday to speak with Bairstow about his future, assured the 29-year-old that he still has a big part to play for England. Smith added: \u201cHe\u2019s a central cricketer for England across the formats, he\u2019s got a fantastic future in an England shirt and that is some of the things we\u2019ll be talking about face to face.
