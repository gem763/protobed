That represents a 107% return on investment \u2014 the highest payoff of any single home renovation project in the study. Additionally, 39% of realtors surveyed said they have suggested the project to sellers, and 33% said the project \u201chelped close a sale,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe Remodeling Impact Report determined which home renovation projects have the greatest value by surveying two groups of trade professionals: NAR members and members of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry (NARI). Members of NARI provided cost estimates for 20 of the report\u2019s projects, while NAR members estimated the value those projects add to a house.\n\nAn old roof can be a \u201csticking point\u201d in a home sale, says Nick Gelfand, a realtor and appraiser in Longmeadow, Mass. \u2014 especially if the buyer is financing the purchase with an FHA or VA loan, which require a roof to be in decent shape before the sale. \u201cI believe having a roof on your home that has life left is incredibly important to a successful sale,\u201d Gelfand says.\n\nLike any home renovation project, though, the project\u2019s value varies based on your specific situation. Dana Bull, a Boston-based realtor, says a roof \u201cwould really need to be an extremely old roof that has moss growing on it for me to highly, highly recommend replacing it.\u201d A new roof isn\u2019t a project buyers often notice immediately, so, if you\u2019re trying to boost the value of your home, it\u2019s important to ask your agent for advice before you start. \u201cIf there\u2019s still some life in it, we may just price it accordingly and expect that it\u2019s going to come up as a negotiating point,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile new roofing might have the best value of the projects the Remodeling Impact Report considered, it\u2019s not the only renovation that offers bang for your buck.
