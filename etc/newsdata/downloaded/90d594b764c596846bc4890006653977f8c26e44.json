She also ignored George Stephanopoulos\u2019 follow-up question about whether middle-class taxes will go up and private insurance be eliminated as a result of \"Medicare-for-All.\"\n\nBernie Sanders challenged Biden\u2019s insistence that his health bill will cost $30 trillion, saying the status quo would cost more and he\u2019d eliminate all deductibles. Warren said she\u2019d never met anyone who liked their health insurance company.\n\nThose opening moments were a microcosm of the ABC Democratic debate in Houston, practically spray-painting a clear dividing line between Biden\u2019s moderate liberalism and Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 socialist-style democracy.\n\nDEBATE DESCENDS INTO MELEE OVER HEALTH CARE, OBAMA, SOCIALISM AS DEMS STRUGGLE TO SHOW UNITY\n\nThe bottom line: The third debate was Biden\u2019s best by far. He was consistently forceful and took far less flak than last time. Warren, Sanders and to a lesser extent Kamala Harris hit their marks, but did nothing to shake up the race.\n\nBiden, in an unusual shout that almost matched Bernie\u2019s high-decibel rasp, declared: \u201cNobody\u2019s yet said how much it\u2019s gonna cost!\u201d\n\nThe former vice president, often chided for being too low key, swiftly responded when Sanders decried the plight of cancer patients. \u201cI know a lot about cancer, it\u2019s personal to me,\u201d Biden said, alluding to the loss of his son Beau.\n\nThere was one telling nuance that showed the Democrats felt stung by the criticism after the Detroit debate that they trashed Barack Obama\u2019s policies. Even as they took on Biden, Warren, Kamala Harris and others took a moment to praise Obama for tremendous progress. As Biden said of Warren, \u201cThe senator said she\u2019s for Bernie, well I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d\n\nIn a section on racial issues, ABC\u2019s African-American reporter Linsey Davis offered no challenge as Cory Booker called President Trump a racist, and Beto O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro said the president inspired the El Paso shooter. But Davis did challenge the record of the two former prosecutors, Harris and Amy Klobuchar, from the left. She later demanded to know what Biden would do about the legacy of slavery, unearthing a four-decade-old quote that he shouldn\u2019t have to pay reparations for what was done 300 years ago.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nThe exchanges on gun control were also revealing. Biden pronounced himself the only person on stage to beat the NRA (with the Brady bill), but was attacked for saying any action had to be constitutional. Yet O\u2019Rourke got a huge cheer for saying he\u2019s in favor of confiscation for military-style weapons: \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47\u2026\u201d Republicans will have a field day with that.\n\nTo his credit, ABC anchor David Muir pressed Booker on how any form of gun confiscation could pass.\n\nUnivision\u2019s Jorge Ramos came off as a crusader, making no effort to hide his advocacy for illegal immigration. He demanded that Biden admit it was a mistake for the Obama administration to deport 3 million immigrants who broke the law to be here. (Biden said their policies were far more humane than Trump\u2019s and invoked the dreamers.)\n\nRamos also unleashed an attack on Trump\u2014\u201ctried to ban Muslims from entering the country\u201d\u2014in the form of a question. His diatribes stood in stark contrast to the more measured questioning of Stephanopoulos and Muir.\n\nOn Afghanistan, Biden did break with Obama by saying he opposed the troop surge there, and Sanders said that unlike the former Delaware senator, he voted against the Bush administration\u2019s march to war in Iraq.\n\nA three-hour debate is enough to try to patience of even dedicated junkies. Joe Biden entered this debate ahead in the polls and did nothing to damage that standing. It was predictable that Warren and Sanders stuck to their mutual non-aggression pact, but a bit surprising that neither of them really took on the front-runner.", "description": "The bottom line: The third debate was Biden\u2019s best by far.
