Through the service, some 70,000 teachers living in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere give online English lessons to more than 600,000 children, aged four to 15 and living primarily in China.\n\nTencent, one of China\u2019s largest tech giants and one of the world\u2019s most active tech investors, had initially balked at the investment, concerned by VIPKid\u2019s financials as well as new Chinese regulations governing online education, one of the people said. Still, it is moving forward with the deal, the people said.\n\nReuters reported earlier that Tencent had concerns over a potential investment.\n\nVIPKid had originally targeted raising as much as $500 million in the funding round, and has been eyeing a valuation of $4.5 billion, said people familiar with the fundraising, up from $3.5 billion last year.\n\nBut the round has taken longer than anticipated, prompting VIPKid to recently hire China Renaissance, an investment bank, to help scout out potential investors, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nA VIPKid spokesman said the company is pleased with the round and believes it will meet its goals, adding: \u201cWe envision a global classroom that empowers students and teachers.\u201d\n\nVIPKid is soliciting funds against a challenging backdrop, including the high cost of acquiring and retaining teachers and students. It is also facing a lawsuit filed in July in California by a teacher who says she should be treated as an employee, not an independent contractor. VIPKid said the claim was without merit.\n\nA teacher giving English-language instruction to Chinese students via VIPKid.

U.S. hedge-fund firm Coatue Management LLC, which co-led a previous round, has tried in recent months to unload part of its stake in VIPKid, some of the people added. A person familiar with Coatue\u2019s thinking said the firm isn\u2019t currently selling its stake.\n\nSome analysts say the education tech industry is poised for consolidation, with larger companies now able to distribute products from smaller players. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd. in July acquired iTutorGroup, a VIPKid competitor, in a deal that valued iTutorGroup at around $5 billion, people familiar with the matter say.\n\nChina\u2019s new rules require online teachers to be certified, a costly and lengthy process, and also mandate that some of the data that online education companies collect be stored in China. The Chinese Ministry of Education said the rules protect students by ensuring teachers are qualified to teach.\n\nVIPKid could also struggle to attract and retain talent as concerns rise among U.S. lawmakers and officials about the company\u2019s collection of teachers\u2019 Social Security numbers, bank-account information and home addresses, all of which are stored in China.\n\nVIPKid has long collected such data for paychecks and background checks, and there is no evidence to suggest it is being misused.\n\nThe company\u2019s privacy policy doesn\u2019t specifically say it stores Social Security numbers and bank-account details in China, but the company confirmed that it does, adding that VIPKid complies with all U.S. and Chinese laws, takes data security seriously and works with the most respected global providers of data storage on the cloud.\n\nEven so, U.S. lawmakers and officials at the State Department and National Security Council have raised concerns about data privacy in China in recent years as the country pushes for data to be kept on the mainland.\n\nSen.

Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the State Department said that, for Chinese companies in general, the U.S. \u201cis concerned about Chinese data localization laws and regulations that may require U.S. firms to store data in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cStoring data locally runs contrary to the norms of a free and open internet, and may compromise intellectual property or personally identifiable information,\u201d the State Department spokesperson said. \u201cThese measures are another example of China\u2019s unfair trade practices\u2026that we would like China to end immediately.\u201d\n\nThe handling of sensitive U.S. data took on greater importance after the government disclosed in 2015 that hackers suspected of being connected to China stole more than 21 million Social Security numbers from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nEarlier this year, American national-security officials ordered a Chinese company, Beijing Kunlun Tech Co. , to sell gay-dating app Grindr to prevent personal data from being exploited by Beijing. The company also agreed to stop Grindr\u2019s operations in China, to keep its headquarters in the U.S. and to refrain from sending sensitive personal data to China. In July, Kunlun said it planned to list Grindr on a foreign stock market after U.S. authorities dropped their objections to an IPO.\n\nU.S. officials last year blocked the sale of MoneyGram International Inc. to Chinese company Ant Financial Services Group over national-security concerns regarding Americans\u2019 sensitive data.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year on a clampdown by VIPKid on how Western teachers treat sensitive topics such as Taiwan and the Tiananmen Square crackdown. The company said at the time it was hewing to parents\u2019 preferences about what information is taught to their children.\n\n\u2014Xiao Xiao and Lekai Liu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Shan Li at shan.li@wsj.com", "description": "Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings is set to invest $150 million in VIPKid, according to people familiar with the matter, pushing a funding round closer to completion even amid concerns among some current and prospective investors over the Chinese online education company\u2019s business model.", "authors": ["Julie Steinberg In London", "Shan Li In Beijing", "Julie Steinberg", "Shan Li", "Julie.Steinberg Wsj.Com", "Shan.Li Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-100249/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
