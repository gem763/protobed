Guyger was still in her police uniform after a long shift when, according to her trial testimony, she mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own one floor below and shot him after pushing open his unlocked door and thinking he was a burglar.\n\nBrown, 28, testified in Guyger\u2019s trial about the September 2018 night that Jean was killed, saying he was in a hallway on the fourth floor, where he and Jean lived. He said he heard what sounded like \u201ctwo people meeting by surprise\u201d and then two gunshots.\n\nBrown, who became emotional at times and used his T-shirt and tissue to wipe his tears, said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.\n\nGuyger, 31, was fired from the department soon after the shooting. She was convicted Tuesday and sentenced the next day to 10 years in prison.\n\nThe newspaper did not cite authorities by name for confirmation of Brown\u2019s death. A Dallas police spokesman on Saturday would not confirm to The Associated Press that it was Brown who was shot Friday. He said the Dallas County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office would determine the identification Sunday.\n\nPolice said in a news release that they responded to the shooting shortly after 10:30 p.m. Friday at an apartment complex different from the one where Jean was killed. They said several witnesses flagged officers down when they arrived and directed them to an apartment parking lot where the man who was shot was lying on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nThe man was taken to a hospital, where he died.\n\nWitnesses told police they heard several gunshots and saw a silver four-door sedan speeding out of the parking lot, according to the police news release.\n\nLee Merritt, a lawyer for the Jean family, said in a tweet Saturday that he spoke with Brown\u2019s mother and that she is \u201cdevastated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all are,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cJoshua Brown was a key witness in the murder of Botham Jean that helped put Amber Guyger away. We need answers.\u201d\n\nIn a statement he included with the tweet, he said authorities have not identified a suspect or determined a motive.\n\n\u201cBrown deserves the same justice he sought to ensure the Jean family,\u201d Merritt said in the statement.\n\nDallas County prosecutor Jason Hermus said Brown \u201cbravely came forward to testify when others wouldn\u2019t,\u201d according to the newspaper.\n\n\u201cIf we had more people like him, we would have a better world,\u201d said Hermus, who was lead prosecutor in the case.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joshua Brown, a \"key witness\" in the murder trial of a white Dallas police officer who fatally shot her black neighbor, has been killed in a shooting.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/dallas_officer_mistaken_apartment_witness_72920_c0-606-6519-4406_s1770x1032.jpg?e1ef705e0d14c008262a3f34318646379e119092", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
