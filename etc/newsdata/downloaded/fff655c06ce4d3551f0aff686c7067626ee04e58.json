That includes not only their income, but also a wealth tax that whittles away at the family fortune.\n\nThe 97.5% average effective tax rate under his plans compares with 23% now and 62% under Warren\u2019s proposals, according to the two economists.\n\nSanders and Warren have both pitched wealth taxes, which is a key reason that their plans tax billionaires so much more. Warren\u2019s wealth tax places a 2% levy on fortunes above $50 million and a 3% levy on assets more than $1 billion. Sanders\u2019 plan goes further, and starts taxing wealth of $32 million at 1%, increasing to an 8% tax on fortunes above $10 billion.\n\n\u201cWith the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes,\u201d Saez said in an email about Sanders\u2019 tax, which Sanders has said would cut the number of billionaires in the country in half in 15 years.\n\nThe calculations by Saez and Zucman cover state, local and federal taxes and also treat health insurance premiums that individuals pay as a tax, arguing that they are one of main drivers of inequality in the U.S.\n\nIf a Democrat wins in 2020, wealthy Americans would fare best if it were Joe Biden, even though the former vice president would hit the rich with a markedly bigger tax burden -- an effective average rate of 30.6%, or more than 7 percentage points higher than they face now under President Donald Trump.\n\nRead More: Why Taxing the Rich Is Popular But Isn\u2019t Always Easy: QuickTake\n\nLarge tax increases on the rich have been a key topic in the 2020 Democratic primary as candidates have looked for proposals that would lessen inequality and raise lots of revenue to pay for expensive social programs, such as expanded health care and free college tuition.\n\nThe economists released an interactive website Sunday that lets users select different tax rates to see how levies on various income groups are increasing. Saez and Zucman are also releasing a book on Tuesday, \u201cThe Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay,\u201d making the case for large tax increases on top earners.\n\nAll major Democratic candidates have called for higher taxes on the wealthy, including raising the income tax rates or increasing levies on capital gain income. Sanders, Warren and Senator Kamala Harris have also floated levies on stock and bond trades.\n\nTaxes on the wealthy have historically been popular with voters. For decades a majority of polls have shown that people think the wealthy pay too little in taxes. Gallup found in April that 62% of people say that \u201cupper-income\u201d individuals pay too little in taxes.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Rich Miller in Washington at rmiller28@bloomberg.net;Laura Davison in Washington at ldavison4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Billionaires may have much more to fear from a Bernie Sanders presidency than they do from an Elizabeth Warren administration, according to two economists advising both candidates.That\u2019s one of the conclusions of a new interactive website developed by University of California, Berkeley", "authors": ["Rich Miller", "Laura Davison"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OOpdybMHRGE6YtNiLbrGmg--~B/aD04ODI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/cfeaab5824dcab1cfdf499cce932534f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
