With the aid of a prosthetic leg, she planned to join more than a dozen Colombian military and law enforcement veterans who suffered similar injuries in Colombia\u2019s conflicts with rebels and narcotics cartels. The run is a victory lap of sorts for people who rebuilt their lives after suffering catastrophic injuries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s helping us to go forward,\u201d said Jefrey Cardenas, 35, a former commander of a special forces unit in the Colombian Army, who lost a leg after stepping on a land mine.\n\nThe group of disabled athletes met at the Washington Monument with other Colombian members of the military and law enforcement for some last-minute training and socializing on the eve of the marathon, a 26.2-mile race expected to draw about 30,000 people. The race starts Sunday in Arlington and leads runners over the Potomac River, through Georgetown, Rock Creek Park and around the Mall. Members of the Colombian group plan to use hand-pedaled bicycles or prostheses that allow them to walk or run.\n\nThe event was pulled together by the Colombian Embassy, with assistance from United for Colombia, a nonprofit foundation with offices in the District and Bogota that provides medical and rehabilitative services for people who have been injured during Colombia\u2019s internal strife.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGabriella Febres-Cordero, its founder, said the organization helps obtain prosthetics for civilians, military personnel and even injured guerrillas who have renounced conflict. Bringing them to Washington for the marathon is a way to celebrate their recovery.\n\n\u201cLook at the faces \u2014 you don\u2019t need words. It\u2019s absolutely heartfelt,\u201d she said.\n\nMarcial Calderon, 45, of Bogota, was commanding a special forces unit against rebel forces in Ca\u00f1on de la Llorona in August 2005 when an improvised explosive device exploded in his face, blinding him and inflicting severe burns. Now a law student, he intends to run while tethered to his guide, Catalina Alvarez, a Medellin-based employee of United for Colombia.\n\nAD\n\nPierry Ramirez, 43, a former police officer from Bogota, lost one leg and the use of the other when an improvised explosive device exploded while he was driving behind a military convoy in Sibate about 25 years ago.\n\nAD\n\nRamirez, who was off-duty at the time, remembers only a flash of light that changed his life forever. Thoughts of family \u2014 particularly his parents, who relied on him \u2014 helped him go on. Now, Ramirez heads the Achilles International chapter in Bogota, a group that offers support to athletes with disabilities and also made the marathon trip possible. \u201cMy mission is to do this sport in my country,\u201d he said.\n\nCardenas was leading an effort to eradicate coca in the mountains near Tumaco in August 2018 when he stepped on the land mine, presumably planted by narcotics traffickers. The explosion threw him into the air, and he landed in its crater.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen I tried to stand up, I saw I didn\u2019t have a leg,\u201d Cardenas said, speaking through an interpreter.\n\nIn the hospital afterward, he sometimes felt despair.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou think your life is over. You don\u2019t want to be here on this earth,\u201d Cardenas said. But that passed when he saw how happy his family was to find him alive. Religious faith helped, as did sports. \u201cIt lifted me up.\u201d\n\nOrtiz had always been sporty, playing basketball and participating in gymnastics until the Christmas Eve attack. She went without medication and only primitive medical attention for at least 24 hours after the ambush because the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrillas who hit her father\u2019s police station also raided the town\u2019s hospital and took its medicine.\n\nAD\n\nWhen she awoke, she realized life would never be the same.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult thing was finding the right prosthesis because the ones they gave me were so basic,\u201d Ortiz said. In 2017, through United for Colombia, she received a prosthetic leg that made it easier for her to go up and down the many stairs at her university. She also resumed participating in sports, training for 5Ks and Sunday\u2019s marathon.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSports, in general, helped me to build more confidence in myself,\u201d said Ortiz, 33, who now works as legal counsel for McDonald\u2019s there.\n\n\u201cI used to cover up my prosthetic leg before,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cBeing a woman, it was a very hard thing to accept. I was ashamed. Through sports, I don\u2019t mind showing that I have a prosthetic. Now I\u2019m proud of showing people my prosthetic.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The group includes soldiers, police \u2014 and a civilian who lost her leg when she was 13.", "authors": ["Fredrick Kunkle", "General Assignment Reporting"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HL-9hXDroj33MDfOqfw8ROAxV04=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRBPRJHYD4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
