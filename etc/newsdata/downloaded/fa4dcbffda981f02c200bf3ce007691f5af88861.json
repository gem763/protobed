But now it transpires that Cain has another son \u2013 and it\u2019s a guy who is very much out to get him as he has deliberately seduced Moira and also tried to get him to lose custody of Kyle.\n\nIt seems to have hit Faith (Sally Dexter) pretty hard too as she found evidence of who Nate is in his caravan and to say she looked troubled is an understatement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain was half way towards killing Nate during their vicious fight when Nate chucked in that bombshell before barking at a hysterical Moira that her use was over \u2013 he had only ever been sleeping with her to destroy Cain.\n\nEmmerdale is remaining secretive over exactly how Nate fits in to the Dingle family tree and who his mother is \u2013 as well as whether Cain actually knew he had a long lost son in the first place. There is also the chance that Nate is lying but judging by Faith\u2019s reaction, this seems unlikely.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThere\u2019s a lot still to be explained but all three still have to make it out of this mess alive \u2013 we have left Moira struggling fo life at the bottom of the lake and the boat carrying Cain and Nate is about to blow up.\n\nRight now, paternity seems the least pressing matter\u2026\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cain gets the daddy of all shocks.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22_10_emm_nate_cain_moira_08-e8e4_1571770649.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
