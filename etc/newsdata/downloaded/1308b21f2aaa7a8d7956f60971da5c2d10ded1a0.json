It\u2019s unmanned flight that could be aviation\u2019s next big transformation.\n\nAt this year\u2019s Paris Air Show, Airbus said it\u2019s trying to attract aviation regulators to the idea of pilotless commercial travel. So is rival Boeing.\n\nTheir timing couldn\u2019t be better. With demand for air travel soaring, over 800,000 new pilots may be needed over the next 20 years. However, the supply of new pilots is struggling to keep up with demand, producing what Boeing has called \u201cone of the biggest challenges\u201d facing the airline industry.\n\nBut while pilotless technology offers relief, it poses challenges of its own that could ultimately stand in the way of autonomous airlines taking to the skies. Here are three of them.\n\nPolitics\n\nInnovation invariably creates winners and losers. The introduction of the automobile shifted consumer demand away from trains much like the railways had, in decades prior, displaced canals and waterways as major forms of transportation. The result was job offers for some workers and pink slips for others. This reality is best summed up by Nicholas Carr, in his book, The Glass Cage, Automation and Us: \u201cThere is no economic law that says that everyone, or even most people, automatically benefit from technological progress.\u201d\n\nYou might also like:\n\nPilotless planes are a prime example of this. While the technology promises to revolutionise travel, its asking price is jobs \u2013 specifically, piloting jobs. The airline industry employs tens of thousands of aviators worldwide \u2013 skilled professionals who ferry billions of passengers across trillions of kilometers. Delegating this task to machines would produce widespread unemployment among pilots, culminating in a struggle to ply their skills to a new trade. That's hardly an easy task considering the unique skillset flying demands.\n\nThat\u2019s where politics come in. Airline pilots are backed by powerful labour unions, organisations that use collective bargaining, campaign contributions and political lobbying to influence issues affecting their members.\n\nTake the Air Line Pilots Association (Alpa). Representing over 63,000 aviators worldwide, a compelling example of Alpa\u2019s influence dates back to the 1960s. In decades prior, airplanes required a third crew member in the cockpit. This flight engineer monitored airplane instruments and assisted pilots with troubleshooting. However, technological advances made flight engineers obsolete and manufacturers started producing airplanes with only two crew in mind.\n\nHowever, given the inevitability of job losses among its members, Alpa resisted the adoption of these craft, waging what was by one account \"a long struggle, contractually to get management to give (flight engineers) meaningful duties\u201d. Similar tactics are likely should pilotless technology reach maturity. Alpa has already voiced opposition to further reducing crew numbers.\n\nThough crashes are rare, they do happen and when they do, airline balance sheets take a hit\n\nLabour unions have allies in their fight against algorithms. That\u2019s because automating flying doesn\u2019t just threaten commercial airline jobs. Corporate flight academies train an increasing number of today\u2019s aviators. So do universities, colleges and small flight schools. These institutions employ tens of thousands of personnel \u2013 like flight instructors, ground lecturers and simulation experts \u2013 to run pilot training programs worldwide. Pilotless technology also threatens these professions.\n\nInsurance\n\nAircraft aren\u2019t cheap. The Boeing 737 \u2013 a small, single-aisle passenger jet \u2013 costs upwards of $100m (\u00a380m) apiece. Its larger, twin-aisle counterpart \u2013 the Boeing 777 \u2013 costs over $300m (\u00a3240m). Though airlines get discounts for bulk orders, the final bill can still be substantial. In 2011, American Airlines spent over $30bn (\u00a324bn) on revamping its fleet. Indigo Airlines \u2013 an Indian start-up carrier \u2013 forked out an equally hefty amount for its fleet. Recovering those costs means putting airplanes to work and that can be risky. Though crashes are rare, they do happen and when they do, airline balance sheets take a hit.\n\nThat\u2019s where insurance comes in. Airlines buy policies to cover losses if an aircraft is damaged or destroyed. These policies also protect carriers against claims stemming from crash-related injuries and property damage. Exactly how much airlines pay for insurance coverage is anyone\u2019s guess \u2013 insurers guard their rates to maintain a competitive edge. However, premiums collectively cost the industry billions annually, making this expense a key determinant of an airline\u2019s potential profit (or loss).\n\nAn important question facing pilotless technology is how its introduction will affect premiums. Conventional wisdom suggests premiums should drop. After all, pilotless planes \u2013 powered by a sophisticated array of sensors and software \u2013 eliminates the culprit implicated in most airplane accidents: humans. This means that while crashes today are rare, they will \u2013 in the era of pilotless flight \u2013 be rarer. Fewer crashes will mean fewer payouts by insurers and the ensuing savings should be passed along to airlines in the form of lower premiums.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the idea. The reality may be more complicated.\n\nToday\u2019s airliners are already algorithmic heavyweights. Unlike their predecessors that relied on mental muscle to fly, modern jets count on software. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner \u2013 a staple of fleets worldwide and state-of-the-art aircraft \u2013 is powered by millions of lines of code. More code allows for more safety-enhancing features \u2013 things like turbulence detectors that pre-emptively sense rough air, diagnostic systems that monitor an aircraft\u2019s health and smart sensors that automatically stabilise an airplane if the cabin depressurises.\n\nBut more code, while used in the interests of improving safety, also creates a new type of risk, replacing one type of human frailty for another. In 2015, government regulators warned that the Dreamliner could experience failures of its electrical system. The reason? A software glitch \u2013 undetected by engineers \u2013 that could lead to a \u201closs of control of the airplane\u201d. Airbus recently faced similar issues with its flagship jet, the A350. The plane was found prone to a \u201cpartial or total loss of some avionics systems or functions, possibly resulting in an unsafe condition\u201d. The culprit, once again, was software bugs that engineers failed to catch.\n\nAs software\u2019s influence becomes absolute, the number (and danger) posed by coding follies will grow\n\nA related algorithmic risk is hacking. As code becomes more complex, thoroughly testing it for weaknesses becomes harder. This opens the door to exploitation by hackers. In 2008, government regulators warned that the Dreamliner\u2019s flight control system could be accessed via the airplane\u2019s entertainment system, allowing passengers to override pilot commands.\n\nAccording to a government document, the airplane\u2019s design allowed for \u201cnew kinds of passenger connectivity to previously isolated data networks connected to systems that perform functions required for the safe operation of the airplane\u201d. More recently, a team of professionals managed to remotely hack a Boeing 757 using radio waves.\n\nThese risks are set to rise with pilotless planes. As software\u2019s influence becomes absolute, the number (and danger) posed by coding follies will grow. This doesn\u2019t mean the pilotless planes won\u2019t be insured. There is a saying amongst underwriters: there\u2019s no bad risk, only a bad rate.\n\nPut simply, anything is insurable if the price is right. But what is that price and is it one airlines are willing, or are even able, to pay?\n\nSalaries\n\nPilots pocket much of an airline\u2019s earnings. The average pay for flying a jetliner \u2013 assuming at least five years of experience \u2013 starts at $147,000 (\u00a3117,630) annually. Senior pilots can make nearly $300,000 (\u00a3240,000). Such hefty figures reflect the reality facing an industry keen to control costs: pilots are in short supply and learning to fly is both arduous and pricy. These factors push salaries up making them a key influencer of an airline\u2019s labour cost and \u2013 along with fuel \u2013 among an airline\u2019s biggest expenditures.\n\nPilotless technology should of course change this. Swiss bank UBS estimates that removing humans from the commercial cockpit could produce savings upwards of $35bn (\u00a328bn) annually. That figure would boost profits in an industry that has often struggled to make money.\n\nAlgorithms\u2019 cash-saving virtues are well-known. From energy to retail to defence, software is widely credited with slashing costs by automating tasks once delegated to humans. Why can\u2019t the same approach be adopted in commercial aviation?\n\nAerospace manufacturers seem to think it can. In 2017, a Boeing executive embraced the idea of pilotless airplanes, saying, \u201cthe basic building blocks of the technology are clearly available\u201d. Similar sentiments were voiced by his Airbus counterpart earlier this year. The company\u2019s chief commercial officer said Airbus already has \u201cthe technology for autonomous flying\u201d.\n\nManufacturers could try curbing the number of crew on board\n\nYet autonomous does not mean humanless. While sensors and software curb the need for manual labor, that need isn\u2019t \u2013 contrary to we\u2019re told \u2013 purged entirely. In fact, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find one industry where algorithms work without any human involvement or oversight whatsoever. The reason? Automation is imperfect. It errs just like humans do, and when that happens the results can \u2013 depending on the industry \u2013 be catastrophic.\n\nTake the airplane autopilot. First introduced in 1912, \u201cGeorge\u201d, as it is colloquially known, has become a staple of the modern cockpit. When engaged, its algorithms can crunch data faster and more reliably than a human pilot ever could, ultimately producing a safer, smoother flying experience.\n\nBut autopilot failures have also been implicated in several air incidents and crashes. That\u2019s why its use is only approved under the watchful eye of a human pilot. Regulators know that George can\u2019t \u2013 for all his virtual virtues \u2013 be trusted to get it right all the time, every time. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find an aerospace manufacturer who disagrees with such reasoning.\n\nManufacturers could try curbing the number of crew on board. UBS estimates that going from two to one pilot in the cockpit would still produce some savings (though $20bn (\u00a316bn) less than going fully pilotless). According to UBS analyst Celine Fornaro, so-called \u201csingle-pilot operations\u201d, could become a reality as early as 2022.\n\nBut this proposition is equally problematic. That\u2019s because it assumes the sole human pilot will intervene on time, every time automation fails. Manufacturers are wary. This explains why the single-pilot cockpits \u2013 being developed by the likes of Boeing and Airbus \u2013 includes remote supervision.\n\nThe idea is simple. With one pilot behind the controls, a second always stands ready to provide additional support. However, rather than being in the cockpit, the second aviator monitors the aircraft from the ground. It\u2019s a nice idea, but it is one which raises an important question \u2013 how many airplanes should the second pilot watch? After all, paying this individual to just monitor one aircraft wipes out the $15bn (\u00a312bn) cost advantage offered by a single-pilot cockpit. Under these conditions, airlines are better off keeping two aviators on the flight deck. But if remote monitoring costs can be distributed over multiple aircraft, the idea becomes economically more feasible.\n\nCan aerospace manufacturers and airlines guarantee this setup \u2013 one that tests the limits of human attention and memory \u2013 won\u2019t compromise passenger safety\n\nIt also becomes riskier. After all, can one remote pilot really be expected to help a distressed aircraft while keeping an eye on several others? What happens when multiple aircraft need help? Can aerospace manufacturers and airlines guarantee this setup \u2013 one that tests the limits of human attention and memory \u2013 won\u2019t compromise passenger safety?\n\nUntil they can, the concept is unlikely to fly.\n\n--\n\nAshley Nunes studies transportation safety, regulatory policy, and behavioral economics at MIT.\n\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cThe Essential List\u201d.
