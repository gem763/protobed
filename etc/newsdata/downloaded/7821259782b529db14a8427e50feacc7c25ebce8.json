VTR may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\n\n\nThat is because Ventas is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for VTR in this report.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 96 cents per share for VTR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for VTR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.02% heading into earnings season.\n\nVentas, Inc.
