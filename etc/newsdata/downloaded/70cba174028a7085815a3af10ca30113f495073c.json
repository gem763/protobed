But impeachment doesn't require the president to have broken the law.\n\nImpeachment is essentially an indictment in which a majority of House members vote to initiate a trial in the Senate, for whatever reasons they deem worthy. If two-thirds of senators vote to convict at the end of the trial, the president is removed from office.\n\nWhy there's debate:\n\nSupporters of impeachment, many of whom have argued that the process should have started after the release of the Mueller report, say Trump\u2019s use of his office to pursue dirt on a political opponent constitutes a clear-cut abuse of power. \"The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office,\" Pelosi said.\n\nEven though it appears unlikely the Republican-led Senate would vote to remove Trump, impeachment is still necessary, some argue, because the American people deserve a full accounting of the president's actions before they go to the polls in 2020.\n\nMuch of the opposition to impeachment echoes the president's claims that there was nothing wrong with what he did, and that Democrats are looking for any excuse to attack Trump and his administration. Others say Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president was out of line, but didn't rise to the level of impeachment. \"It is possible to do something that is wrong and not be an impeachable offense,\" Sen. Marco Rubio said.\n\nArguments from both sides of the aisle have made the case that the specific facts are irrelevant, since impeachment is ultimately a political decision. Perspectives on whether Democrats or Republicans will benefit at the polls from impeachment vary widely.\n\nWhat's next:\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said formal hearings could start as early as this week, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (who is reported to have listened in on the controversial call) claimed that timeline is \"not feasible.\" How long it will take for the House to complete its inquiry and vote on impeachment could depend on the scope of the investigation. Recent history suggests the process could take between three and six months.\n\nPerspectives:\n\nNo on impeachment\n\nPolitical factors show impeachment is the wrong choice\n\n\"I can see how Trump\u2019s words and actions could add up to an impeachable offense here, but I don\u2019t think it makes sense to impeach him for it. Impeachment is a political choice, to be made prudentially, and a year before an election, at a time when public trust in government is so dismally low already, and given that it\u2019s pretty clear how such a process would end, impeachment doesn\u2019t look wise.\" \u2014 Yuval Levin, National Review\n\nDemocrats will take any excuse to delegitimize the Trump presidency\n\n\"Since the 2016 election, Democrats have set out to reverse the will of voters using any means necessary to discredit, destroy, and remove from office President Trump by impeachment. This illegitimate assault on the office of the president is not only unprecedented, but it\u2019s a threat to our democracy.\" \u2014 Mark Vargas, Washington Examiner\n\nEagerness to impeach led Democrats to see violations that weren't there\n\n\"What this shows, I think, is the kind of anger and even hatred of this president by his political opponents and it has blinded them. It has blinded them to the degree that they think they can make something out of nothing and there's nothing here in this transcript that is impeachable.\" \u2014 Bill Bennett, Fox News", "description": "Details of a phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukraine's leader have led to an impeachment inquiry.
