I was actually at Paleyfest \u2014 I was there for Mixed-ish, and they showed the first episode to fans \u2014 and I wore my Air Force 1s with an African skirt. And you know, it looked really great. I can wear them on the carpet, I can wear them just walking down the street. I usually purchase them from Kith in Soho and West Hollywood. I have the white ones, so I have to clean them a lot, but I\u2019ve probably had five or six pairs over the years.", "description": "Mixed-ish\u2019s Arica Himmel on her favorite things, including Glossier skin-care set, Pattern hair products, Giorgio Armani glasses, Nike Air Force 1s.", "authors": ["Arica Himmel"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/09/23/arica-himmel-wiclw/190923-erica-himmel-WICLW.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
