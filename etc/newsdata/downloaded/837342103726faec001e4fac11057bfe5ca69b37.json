The average analyst rating remained at overweight, but the average price target fell to $372.20 from $393.26 as of Sept. 30.\n\nNetflix\u2019s stock has tumbled 18% over the past three months, while shares of Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.15%, which launches its rival Disney+ streaming service next month, have lost 6.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.09% has slipped 0.6%.\n\nIt was Macquarie\u2019s Nollen who downgraded Netflix to neutral, after being at outperform for nearly two years. He also slashed his price target by 13% to $325 from $375.\n\nHe said that while earnings and revenue were \u201cimpressive\u201d and Netflix still as an \u201cexcellent\u201d opportunity for international growth, \u201cit\u2019s hard to deny the U.S. is maturing,\u201d as domestic subscriber growth was half of what it was and the boost to revenue from price increases is wearing off.\n\n\u201cWe expect competition coming from Disney+ and others, especially in the U.S., will have only a modest effect on churn, but we think it will be hard for Netflix to grow much more in the U.S., and we suspect pricing power is limited,\u201d Nollen wrote in a note to clients. \u201cContent costs continue to rise and marketing demands remain high, and the turn to positive [free cash flow] will take many years, while another debt raise is forthcoming.\u201d\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s Nat Schindler remained one of the more bullish analysts, saying the worst of bears\u2019 fears were alleviated. But he nevertheless cut his price target to $426 from $450, citing a \u201clower cadence\u201d for U.S. subscriber adds and to \u201cadd conservatism\u201d as rising competition makes subscriber growth more difficult.\n\nAnalyst Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital said subscriber additions were \u201cmuch better than feared,\u201d but he cut his price target to $420 from $450 as he is now \u201cless bullish\u201d on global subscriber adds, \u201cslightly more confident on the margin outlook\u201d and slightly less positive on [Netflix\u2019s] pricing power.\u201d\n\nAmong the few analysts who raised their price target, Pivotal Research\u2019s Jeffrey Wlodarczak lifted his to $400 from $350, saying the results show that competition concerns are over overdone.\n\nWlodarczak believes Netflix\u2019s stock is now set up to \u201cclimb a wall of worry\u201d around the launch of Disney+, which he believes will be \u201ccomplementary\u201d to Netflix as it will likely help accelerate the decline in traditional pay-TV services.\n\nMeanwhile, analyst Brian White at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. raised his price target to $350 from $340.\n\n\u201cThe paralyzing fear that gripped Wall Street heading into last night\u2019s call was unprecedented; however, Netflix\u2019s performance was good enough to stabilize the stock,\u201d White wrote.", "description": "Netflix Inc.\u2019s stock rallies Thursday, as investors home in on earnings and subscriber beats, but Wall Street analysts take a more negative view after the...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT523_Netfli_ZG_20191017103122.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
