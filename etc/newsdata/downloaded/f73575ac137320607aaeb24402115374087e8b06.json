Vale, the world\u2019s largest producer of iron ore, also declined to comment other than saying in an email that it would \u201cevaluate in detail\u201d the police reports and would continue to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nThe allegations, against seven Vale officials and six TUV SUD workers, were the first criminal charges brought against the companies over the cataclysmic dam rupture, marking the next phase in a series of criminal and civil investigations into what caused it \u2014 and who is to blame.\n\nIn July, a judge ordered Vale to pay all damages resulting from the disaster, without citing a specific amount. Days later, Vale agreed to pay more than $100 million to the affected families.\n\nOn Jan. 25, the dam in Brumadinho, at the heart of Brazil\u2019s mining-industry operations, spilled nearly 2 million cubic meters of toxic mine waste. The mud crashed into the mine\u2019s administrative headquarters, where hundreds of employees were having lunch, then deluged a small community nearby. For weeks afterward, the dead were dredged from the mud. Dozens of people are still missing.\n\nAfter massive mining disaster, residents navigate a wasteland\n\nThe tragedy again revealed the vulnerability and extraordinary danger associated with that type of dam \u2014 known as a tailings dam \u2014 particularly when situated uphill from a population center. In 2015, another of the dams burst in nearby Mariana, also in Minas Gerais, killing 19 people.\n\nThe collapse in Brumadinho led to reviews of numerous tailings dams found to be similarly vulnerable, endangering thousands of Brazilians living below them. One town, Barao de Cocais in Minas Gerais, was told in May that a nearby dam was at imminent risk of rupturing \u2014 leaving inhabitants to live in the shadow of looming disaster.\n\n\u201cThe climate of uncertainty remains enormous,\u201d said Marden Chaves, the town spokesman. \u201cIn that sense, nothing has changed.\u201d\n\nBut this time, in Brumadinho, authorities allege that it wasn\u2019t just the inherent danger of the dams that was to blame for the collapse.\n\nAt a news conference Friday in Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais, police said officials at Vale and TUV SUD not only knew of the danger facing the dam \u2014 they tried to conceal it.\n\n\u201cWe have testimony that proves that they had knowledge,\u201d said Luiz Augusto Pessoa Nogueira, an official with the Brazilian federal police. \u201cWe have a conversation from an email in which they seem to feel that the dam project would not pass\u201d safety inspections. \u201cEven knowing that, they kept saying that the dam was stable.\u201d\n\nNogueira said the safety inspection company\u2019s desire to maintain a good business relationship with Vale may have compromised its ability to give it bad news.\n\n\u201cTUV SUD didn\u2019t want to create problems with Vale, because they wanted to keep working with Vale in other projects,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal media reported that police are considering additional charges against company employees, including homicide and environmental damage.\n\n\u201cThe investigation continues to punish those responsible for the crimes against life and the environment,\u201d police said in a statement.\n\nLuiz Toledo in Sao Paulo contributed to this report.\n\nVideo: 200 missing, mass devastation in Brazil dam burst\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "13 employees of the Vale mining conglomerate and a German firm were accused of fraudulently confirming the dam was safe before it ruptured in January, killing hundreds.", "authors": ["Terrence Mccoy", "Reporter Covering Social Issues"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/47UAXEW3ZII6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
