Our experts unanimously say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe explosion happened at the launchpad and no satellite had yet been transferred to the launchpad,\u201d Rabiei said. \u201cIt happened at a test site, not at the launch site.\u201d\n\nCommercially available satellite images by Planet Labs Inc. and Maxar Technologies showed a black plume of smoke rising above a launch pad Thursday, with what appeared to be the charred remains of a rocket and its launch stand. In previous days, satellite images had shown officials there repainted the launch pad blue.\n\nThe photo released Friday by Trump appeared to be a once-classified surveillance photo from American intelligence agencies. Analysts said the black rectangle in the photo\u2019s upper-left-hand corner likely covered up the photo\u2019s classification.\n\nThe image showed damaged vehicles around the launch pad, as well as damage done to the rocket\u2019s launcher. It also clearly showed a large phrase written in Farsi on the pad: \u201cNational Product, National Power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,\u201d Trump wrote in his tweet, identifying the rocket used. \u201cI wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.\u201d\n\nRabiei criticized Trump\u2019s decision to tweet about the rocket explosion.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand why the U.S president tweets and posts satellite pictures with excitement. This is not understandable,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is because lack of Iran-related subjects that they raise such issues.\u201d\n\nThe blast followed two failed satellite launches of the Payam and Doosti in January and February. A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Center in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.\n\nOver the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space.\n\nIran is preparing to launch the Nahid-1, a communication satellite, into space.\n\nThe U.S. alleges such satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.\n\nIran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component. Tehran also says it hasn\u2019t violated the U.N. resolution as it only \u201ccalled upon\u201d Tehran not to conduct such tests.\n\nThe tests have taken on new importance to the U.S. amid the maximalist approach to Iran taken by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Tensions have been high between the countries since Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal over a year ago and imposed sanctions, including on Iran\u2019s oil industry. Iran recently has begun to break the accord itself while trying to push Europe to help it sell oil abroad.", "description": "The explosion marked the third failure involving a rocket at the Imam Khomeini Space Center, raising suspicion of sabotage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6d1fc6240000320071fc31.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
