Months later, it stumbled upon the strange substance during its second pass by the seven-foot-wide (two-meter) crater.\n\nWith this latest photo, the current consensus remains the same: that the strange substance is a kind of dark glass which formed as the result of a meteorite impact. The blast likely pressurized and superheated minerals on the lunar surface into a material similar to what the Apollo 17 astronauts discovered.\n\nAlso on rt.com China reveals new PHOTOS of strange substance from dark side of the moon\n\n\u201cI think the most reliable information here is that the material is relatively dark,\u201d Dan Moriarty, NASA Postdoctoral Program fellow at the Goddard Space Flight Center told Space.com.\n\n\u201cIt appears to have brighter material embedded within the larger, darker regions, although there is a chance that is light glinting off a smooth surface.\u201d\n\nThe lander is just about to wake up from a planned two-week nap, during the lunar night, so the next trip to the dark crater which houses the strange, glassy goo might yield more answers - or potentially pose more questions.\n\nLike this story?
