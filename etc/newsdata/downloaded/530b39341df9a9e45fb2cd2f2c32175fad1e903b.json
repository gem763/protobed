Never mind that this president has since the beginning of his campaign run on the idea that he might stop all foreign aid as means to re-evaluate any single nation\u2019s willingness to advance American interests.\n\nThe implication of that threatened withholding seemed to be based on some sort of ill-described plot of that nation\u2019s refusal to investigate \u201cTrump\u2019s political opponent.\u201d (Never mind that the president is allowed to on any level he wishes advise any national leader he chooses, on or about nearly anything he\u2019d like.)\n\nWe have been told that the \u201copponent\u201d he wanted investigated is Joe Biden. (Never mind that Biden is not now, and will likely not be his political opponent, but rather a former candidate for President who\u2019s never gotten more than 6 percent in any national election.)\n\nAlso... Biden is now running second in the first in the nation caucus state of Iowa.\n\nWe have had it told to us that the president was pressuring said country to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s connection to extremely prosperous dealing in said country. The president has implied that when Joe Biden had been vice president that he may have been able to press his thumb to the scale\u2014using his official capacity in office\u2014to enrich his son. (Never mind that the president has repeatedly told the White House press corps, the American people, and even leaders of other governments that \u201csomeone needed to look into that,\u201d on multiple occasions as well.)\n\nThe only problem being... there is no whistleblower.\n\nPer CNN: \u201cThe whistleblower didn't have direct knowledge of the communications, an official briefed on the matter told CNN.\u201d\n\nBy definition this person is not a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d with provable evidence ready to be turned over and deserving of legal protection.\n\nThis person is someone who is spreading hearsay.\n\nAll of the rest of it is just NOISE!\n\nThe reason the acting director of intelligence did not pass on the complaint to Congress is simple: the source is not credible.\n\nNone of this takes into reality the fact that even if Trump was to have done nearly every last detail of what the speculation on twitter claims he has done that he still would not have broken any significant rule or law.\n\nNone of this takes into account that he never withheld the $250 million in aid supposedly discussed at the end of July and delivered it in little more than 30 days.\n\nAnd none of this takes into account the fact that then Vice President Joe Biden appears to have used his influence and position while on our payroll to help guide extremely lucrative business deals in China and Ukraine into his son Hunter\u2019s direction. And that all of those transactions should probably be \u201clooked into.\u201d\n\nThere were many first hand witnesses to the alleged phone call where the (non) whistleblower was said to have derived their facts \u2014 albeit not first hand. No one is corroborating the (non) whistleblower\u2019s narrative.\n\nThe scandal here\u2014as it almost always is the case\u2014points more to wrong doing being done by people who oppose the President.\n\nBut none of this should even receive one more second of consideration.\n\nBecause there is not now, nor was there ever, a whistleblower.", "description": "There is no high-level whistleblower.None.So everything you\u2019ve heard about said .09/22/2019 11:12:37AM EST.", "authors": ["Kevin Mccullough", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/252/74c68734-8bbe-432b-872c-f478258b9d32.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
