Over several days, we used Facebook Ads Manager to run ads that lied about the hot-button political topics of immigration and firearms. The ads were targeted to a tiny portion of Facebook users and we took down the ads after 24 to 48 hours.\n\nWe showed the ads to Facebook, which said it sends ads to third-party fact-checkers based on multiple signals, which may include getting feedback that an ad is false. Facebook said several of our ads shouldn't have run \"because they are about politics or social issues and don't have the appropriate authorization and disclosures.\"\n\nOne ad repeated the false rumor that undocumented immigrants who participate in the 2020 census will be deported\n\nOne ad was targeted to Spanish-speaking Facebook users who had recently been near top ports of entry along the US-Mexico border.\n\nThe ad featured an image of two men in handcuffs and linked to the homepage of US Immmigration and Customs Enforcement. Its copy implied that authorities would use the 2020 census to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nFacebook approved the ad even though the Trump administration in fact abandoned attempts to include a citizenship question on the census in July after a string of court losses.\n\nAnother ad warned ICE and Customs agents that they \"will face justice\"\n\nA second ad was narrowly targeted to employees of ICE and US Customs and Border Protection, a group that included only a few hundred Facebook users.\n\nThe ad falsely suggested that employees of the two federal agencies, which have been the subject of protests during Trump's presidency, could face \"justice\" or be charged with unspecified \"war crimes.\"\n\nThis post linked back to the homepage of RAICES Texas, a non-profit that provides legal services to immigrant and refugee families.\n\nA second, nearly identical and also false version of the same ad was not approved by Facebook. It was unclear why the earlier ad ran while the other was rejected. The only discernible difference between the two was in the copy, which in the second ad read \"ICE, you could be charged with war crimes\" and \"Justice is coming for ICE!\"\n\n\n\nFacebook said in an email that the rejected ad did not comply with the company's advertising policies.\n\n\n\nPer Facebook, the ad was placed in the \"social issues, elections or politics\" category, and a related link stated that any page running such an ad must complete the process to be authorized as a political group.\n\nWe also tried to run other misleading ads that failed to clear Facebook's filter, such as one targeting evangelical Christians that included an image of Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke and falsely suggested that if elected, he would force their churches to perform same-sex marriages.\n\nThe last ad targeted employees of the NRA and Smith & Wesson and said they could \"face charges\" under the next president\n\nOur last ad targeted people who are firearms instructors or work for Smith & Wesson Inc. or the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, the gun rights group's lobbying arm.\n\nThe ad falsely told users that their respective employers \"enable criminals\" and that they may \"face charges\" under the next administration. The ad ran on Facebook and Instagram for about 24 hours.\n\nIn total, the three ads reached a miniscule portion of Facebook and Instagram's estimated 2.41 billion and 1 billion respective worldwide monthly active users. For example, the census ad received more than 3,600 impressions on Facebook while the ICE post got just over 500.\n\nBut users saw them and responded to them.\n\nFacebook's scale makes misinformation impossible to solve\n\nAd fraud specialist Augustine Fou said Facebook's sheer scale makes it impossible to review every ad.\n\nFacebook head Mark Zuckerberg has been emphasizing that responsibility for determining what is true and false ultimately lies with Facebook's users rather than the company itself.\n\nDavid Carroll, associate professor of media design at Parsons and an ad-tech expert, said the problem with this strategy is that it lets everyday users promote misinformation \u2014 as illustrated by the ads Business Insider was able to run.\n\n\"[Facebook] is not only about connecting and communicating,\" he said. \"Everybody can be an advertiser.\"", "description": "Facebook recently promised to fact-check ads run by non-political groups, but Business Insider was easily able to run misleading ads.", "authors": ["Patrick Coffee"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db354a1dee01916cb16baf5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
