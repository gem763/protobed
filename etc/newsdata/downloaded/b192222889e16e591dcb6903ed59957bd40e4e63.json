Facebook said Monday it will also label state-controlled media as such, label fact-checks more clearly and invest $2 million in media literacy projects.\n\nThe company also announced it has removed four networks of fake, misinformation-spreading accounts based in Russia and Iran. These networks sought to disrupt elections in the U.S., North Africa and Latin America, the company said. In the past year, Facebook says it has taken down 50 such clusters of accounts, a sign that efforts to use its services to disrupt elections are not letting up.\n\n\"Elections have changed significantly since 2016 and Facebook has too,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a conference call Monday. The social network was caught embarrassingly off guard during the 2016 election, having let others use its platform to spread misinformation, manipulate voters and meddle with democracy.\n\nThe company says it will also add more prominent labels on debunked posts on Facebook as well as on Instagram.

The company said Monday it has noticed groups and people \"failing\" to disclose the organizations behind pages so people think it is run independently. Starting with large pages in the U.S., Facebook says it is adding a new section about \"organizations that manage this page.\"\n\nFacebook says it will require the page's creators to add this information in order to run ads. The rule applies to pages that have gone through the company's business verification process and to pages that run ads about social issues, elections or politics. If the page creators don't post this information, they won't be allowed to advertise.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Facebook is stepping up its efforts to ensure it is not used as a tool to interfere in politics and democracies around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/AP19261826489506.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
