The Inspector General's office has already turned over a draft of its findings to Attorney General Bill Barr, and a final report is expected in the near future.\n\nDOJ WATCHDOG SUBMITS DRAFT REPORT ON ALLEGED FISA ABUSES TO BARR\n\n\"We came the closest ever to this country having a coup, and now we need accountability,\" McCarthy told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"I respect this attorney general so greatly, that the way he has handled this, he believes in accountability, but more importantly, he believes in the rule of law.\"\n\nWhen asked if there will really be accountability, McCarthy promised, \"Yes.\"\n\nJames Comey and Andrew McCabe, who were the director and deputy director of the FBI when the Russia probe began, have been the subjects of separate IG investigations, and McCarthy believes they will both face consequences.\n\n\"We will see an indictment,\" he said of McCabe, who is facing the prospect of federal charges after Horowitz faulted him in a separate inquiry over statements he made during a Hillary Clinton-related investigation. The review found that McCabe \"lacked candor\" when talking with investigators, but the former FBI official has denied wrongdoing. Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu recommended charges against McCabe after the DOJ rejected his appeal.\n\nUS ATTORNEY RECOMMENDS PROCEEDING WITH CHARGES AGAINST MCCABE, AS DOJ REJECTS LAST-DITCH APPEAL\n\nComey was chastised in a recent report from Horowitz that discussed how Comey improperly maintained records of his conversations with President Trump, and leaked sensitive information about the investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. While the report found that Comey violated department policy, the DOJ opted not to press charges. McCarthy believes that there will be more to come for Comey.\n\n\"In the end, I do not believe that Jim Comey will get off,\" McCarthy predicted, adding, \u201cAnyone that has had any association with trying to create this coup should be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAfter President Trump fired Comey in May 2017, McCabe became acting director of the FBI. McCabe's tenure at the FBI came to an end in March 2018 when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired him in the wake of the IG report of his misstatements.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublicans claim that the FBI, under Comey and McCabe's leadership, misrepresented key information in applying for the FISA warrant for Page in October 2016 -- and three subsequent renewals -- and improperly relied on an unverified dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\nHorowitz\u2019s team has questioned why the FBI considered Steele a credible source, and why the bureau seemed to use news reports to bolster Steele\u2019s credibility.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas, Catherine Herridge, and Jake Gibson contributed to this report.", "description": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., promised that guilty parties will be held accountable after\u00a0Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz releases his report on the FBI's alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in the Russia investigation, and predicted that former bureau leaders James Comey and Andrew McCabe will face criminal charges after what he described as an attempted \"coup\" to take down President Trump.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/Kevin-MCCarthy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
