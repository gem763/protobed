In May, it tried to include Germany, which played no part in the 1950-1953 Korean War, on the list of allies that could supply military aid in case of a war here, but was thwarted by South Korea.\n\nIn June, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff changed rules under which countries are allowed to send troops, weapons and supplies to South Korea in the event of war, raising suspicions that it was trying to include Japan.\n\nThe U.S. military wrote in a strategy report in July that the UNC will continue cooperating with Japan in terms of strategy and supplies during war. It later hastily explained that meant only as a stopover for troops and materiel, not that Japan itself would again be sending soldiers to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nMilitary insiders say the obscure conflict stems from a U.S. attempt to secure a controlling position once South Korea regains wartime control of its military, because it would be in charge of the other allies.\n\nAt present, the U.S. will simply assume command of South Korean forces in a war, a prospect that successive South Korean governments have found intolerable. But the alternative, of a South Korean general commanding American troops here, would be unprecedented.\n\nThe U.S. does not really believe that South Korea is ready to take over control, and is apparently seeking a wider notional alliance to make sure Washington wields ultimate oversight.\n\nThe government here wants the handover of wartime operational control completed by 2022.\n\n", "description": "S.Korea Tells UNC Members That Expansion Requires Its Consent", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
