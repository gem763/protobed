White said he was skeptical at first. However, after seeing Velasquez\u2019s debut performances for Mexican wrestling promotions, his mind quickly changed.\n\n\u201cCain\u2019s had some rough injuries that have happened,\u201d White told reporters, including MMA Junkie. \u201cThe guy\u2019s been a professional athlete for a longtime \u2013 a collegiate athlete. He\u2019s a super nice guy. When it looks like it\u2019s the end of your career and you\u2019re looking at what to do next, it\u2019s always hard for these guys to figure out what\u2019s next.\n\n\u201c\u2018Where do I fit? What do I do?\u2019 I was always like, \u2018How\u2019s Cain going to wrestle? He\u2019s going to have problems with his body in MMA.\u2019 Then I saw him doing the \u2018loobra libay,\u2019 (or) whatever they call wrestling with the mask on. I was like, \u2018Goddamn, he\u2019s pretty good.\u2019 It\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nWhen White received a call from the WWE, he said he knew exactly why they were calling. White indicated it was an easy decision to allow his former heavyweight champion to pursue the next chapter in his athletic career.\n\n\u201cI got a call from WWE,\u201d White said. \u201cI knew. I knew what they were thinking. I was totally cool with it from the minute they called me. They didn\u2019t even ask me. They were just looking for Cain. I figured that\u2019s exactly what they were going to do because it completely makes sense.\u201d\n\nFrom White\u2019s end, there was nothing but respect. He said he hopes Velasquez can follow along a similarly successful path as WWE superstar and former UFC champion Ronda Rousey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for him, I\u2019m happy for his family, and I hope he does well like Ronda did and makes a lot of money,\u201d White said. \u201cI hope the fans over there love him.\u201d\n\nThe complimentary nature of the relationship between White and Velasquez is apparently a two-way street. After a WWE press conference earlier this month, Velasquez credited White for being totally responsive and cooperative to his request to join the WWE.\n\n\u201c(White) just supported me 100 percent,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cIt was just a good, respectful talk that we had. He thanked me for everything that I did. I thanked him and the company for everything that they did.\n\n\u201cHe just gave me his full blessing. He said, \u2018This is awesome, what you\u2019re doing. Go ahead \u2013 you have my full consent to go ahead and do what you want to do.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Officially a member of the WWE, Cain Velasquez has put his MMA career behind him.
