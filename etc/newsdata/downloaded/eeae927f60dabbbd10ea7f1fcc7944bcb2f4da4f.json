Some of his shots have been nothing short of exceptional and he is bringing the best out in Nadal who hits two forehand winners to hold serve.\n\n1:23AM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 1-2 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nMedvedev has come to the net 62 times so far tonight, a tactic rarely associated with the Russian. He has been clear in his strategy and brave in its execution. A volleyed winner wins him the game and illustrates that he is playing the big point better than Nadal - who would have thought we'd be saying that two hours ago?\n\nOne worrying sign for Medvedev is that the trainer is now on rubbing the Russian's legs.\n\n1:19AM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 1-1 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nAt 0-15 Medvedev hits the return of the match, from downtown on his backhand to give Nadal no chance - he is clearly as confident as you can be in the fifth set of your first grand slam final.\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo points later he moves Nadal around with some fierce groundstrokes to hit a brilliant forehand winner and get two break points. Nadal responds with a great dropshot winner and then another forehand which Medvedev cannot keep out. But having saved the two break points the Spaniard inexplicably hits a relatively easy volley wide - a sign of tiredness, perhaps?\n\nA long volley subsequently gives Nadal service point and a big first serve wins him the game.\n\nThis is epic stuff for us viewers and energy-sapping for the players - it's great to watch.\n\n1:12AM\n\nCan Nadal turn this around?\n\nNadal looks pained after Medvedev takes the match into a fifth set Credit: AFP\n\n1:11AM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 0-1 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nThis is now a winner-takes-all set. Bizarrely Medvedev must be slight favourite after the last two sets.\n\nHe shows no signs of early fifth-set nerves as he plays two great winners, peppering the Spaniard's baseline time after time. Nadal doesn't know what has hit him, and cannot be the only one to be dumbfounded at the Russians resurgence.\n\nMedvedev makes the perfect start to continue his perfect comeback.\n\n1:07AM\n\nMedvedev wins fourth set 6-4 - match goes to a fifth-set decider!\n\nNadal always looked well ahead in this game, but then the Russian once again came into the net to win a point at 30-0. Then at 40-30 he hit a brilliant forehand winner down the line. Nadal then displayed nerves rarely seen hitting a wide forehand to gift Medvedev a set point. The 23 year old makes no mistake to break Nadal's serve and claim the fourth set.\n\nBrilliant from Medvedev who must now be the favourite. What a turnaround!\n\n12:58AM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-5 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nMedvedev takes the first point with a perfect drop shot volley - a sign, if any was needed, that he is not doubting whether he can still win this title.\n\nHe holds with another ace, his 10th, and he is looking ever more cool, calm and collected.\n\nPrediction: this is going to go to a fifth set...\n\n12:56AM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-4 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nWhat the doctor ordered for Nadal - a simple, easy on the legs and arms game. He holds to love, winning with a confident overhead smash.\n\nHe finishes the game imploring the New York crowd to get behind him even more.\n\n12:53AM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 3-4 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nMedvedev hits his eighth ace but Nadal is becoming increasingly aggressive in the rallies and gets it to 15-30.\n\nThe Russian responds with another ace and wins the next point, another attritional baseline battle. He makes sure of holding serve by running down every Nadal shot before hitting a sublime forehand winner on the run.\n\nHe is displaying great balance with his groundstrokes and Nadal needs to somehow stop this momentum shift soon.\n\n12:48AM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 3-3 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nMedvedev has been accurate when has needed to be over the past two sets dealing with Nadal's heavy topspin. A backhand winner first up is another example of his composure and accuracy.\n\nA 25-shot rally follows, won by Nadal who then displays his soft hands with an exquisite drop shot. Nadal is able to hold and is looking less flustered than at the back end of the third set.\n\n12:44AM\n\nRushing into the net\n\nBoth players have been coming into the net increasingly often as the match has progressed Credit: REX\n\n12:42AM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 2-3 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nThe Russian starts well with a serve and volley, followed up with an ace. Having been in the dominant position in the rally he then hits a backhand long - a tame error. Another backhand error, this time into the net, allows Nadal back into the game.\n\nThe Spaniard uses his slice to then force yet another backhand error to earn a break point. He can't make it count as Medvedev shows yet more balls rushing into the net - something he is doing more and more. It gets back to deuce but another long backhand gives Nadal another break point, which Medevdev again snuffs out.\n\nThe Russian finds a big forehand to hold. This is brilliant from the 23 year old.\n\nThis is attritional stuff, but never anything less than compelling and pulsating.\n\n12:35AM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 2-2 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nMaybe someone told Nadal that Medvedev is yet to win a five-set match as he looks far more confident on his serve, holding to love.\n\nThat looked more like the dominant Nadal of the first two sets.\n\n12:30AM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 1-2 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nThis is fast becoming a great clash. Even after over three hours on court the shot selection is something to marvel at - a lob from Nadal getting the crowd once again to its feet in awe. Medvedev holds and this is a tussle that could be decided by who is able to overcome any tiredness they doubtless feel.\n\n12:27AM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 1-1 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nNadal starts the game with two wayward serves, something that only emphasizes the way this match is currently going. He summons up the serve and volley game that has served him so well tonight to get it back to 30-30 but a forehand into the net - another tame error - gifts Medvedev a break point.\n\nNadal then produces two great shots, the second a wonderful backhand down the line to get to advantage and he is able to claim the game with an ace.\n\nMomentum is still with the Russian but that hold will doubtless give Nadal some much-needed confidence.\n\n12:21AM\n\nMomentum against Nadal...\n\nNadal is up against it in New York Credit: Getty Images\n\n12:19AM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 0-1 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nComing into the fourth set the momentum was clearly with Medvedev, he had Nadal on the run and starting to question some confidence in his groundstrokes. Not many players do this to Nadal, let alone while two sets down in a US Open final.\n\nNadal looked a little bit lost out there as Medvedev made it 40-0. But the Spaniard gets it back to deuce before his opponent once again gets the crowd on their feet with a running volley down the line, before a great backhand winner crosscourt.\n\nThis is unbelievable stuff from Medvedev.\n\n12:13AM\n\nMedvedev wins third set 7-5 - Nadal leads 7-5, 6-3, 5-7\n\nMedvedev has caught a second wind. Having looked tired at the end of the second set the Russian looks the fresher of the two, something illustrated as he outlasted Nadal in another baseline battle in the first point of this game. Nadal then plants a forehand into the net to give Medvedev a 0-30 lead and more than a glimmer of claiming the third set.\n\nThat's then followed up with the Russian's best point of the match, he finishes off a long rally with an exquisite forehand winner down the line. That's three set points and the first time Nadal has been 0-40 down this tournament. He gets one point back but Medvedev wins the very next point to claim the third set.\n\nWhat a turnaround from Medvedev, utterly brilliant from the Russian!\n\n12:07AM\n\nMasterful Medvedev\n\nThe Russian has won over a lot of fans tonight Credit: AP\n\n12:06AM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 5-6 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nIt should come as no surprise, but Medvedev does not wilt under pressure and holds it to love thanks to a mixture of serve volleying and composure.\n\nHe wins it with an ace. Whatever the result tonight he has shown enough tonight to suggest this will not be his only visit to a grand slam final.\n\n12:02AM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 5-5 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nServing to stay in the set Nadal looks strong. The longer the rallies the better he's looking, in contrast to the first two sets.\n\nHe holds to love and the pressure is back onto Medvedev - can he hold his nerve? Will he serve and volley?\n\n11:59PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 4-5 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nWhile he has been coming into the net as much as possible Medvedev has never been able to completely trust his volley and another mistake at the net gives Nadal a 0-30 advantage.\n\nThe Russian gets it back to 30-30. The next point is another humdinger, it takes two to make rallies like that. Yet another baseline battle, full of powerful groundstrokes ends with Nadal coming into the net to claim a break point. He isn't able to make it count, though, Medvedev shows so much heart to get it to deuce. Nadal, however, is able to then beat the Russian with pace to claim another break point. He's not able to make it count as another missed overhead into the net (that's his third of the night by my counting...) gets it back to deuce. Medvedev comes into the net for the advantage and then smashes the winner to hold another serving game.\n\nMedvedev is winning over the crowd through sheer determination here and it's a thrill to watch.\n\n11:50PM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 4-4 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nThe game starts with another baseline battle, both using the slice well, but it's Nadal who attacks first coming into the net to play another clean, crisp volleyed winner. That's followed up with much the same tactic from Nadal, he claims the point pushing Medvedev wide to the right before smashing a forehand clean down the left. It's relentless torture for the Russian and illustrates why Nadal is only one set away from his 19th grand slam title.\n\nHe goes on to hold to love, understandable that Medvedev looked pretty tired those last two, quick, points.\n\n11:45PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 3-4 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nThat break has clearly given Medvedev confidence (not that he was lacking in it to start with...) that he can still win. A superb, almost ballsy drop shot typifies his talent and competitive spirit. He once again holds without too many issues to put the pressure, for the first time this set, onto Nadal.\n\n11:43PM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 3-3 Medvedev* (*next server) - Medvedev breaks back\n\nFull credit to Medvedev, he is not giving up despite what seems the inevitability of another Nadal grand slam title. The first signs of frailty on the Nadal serve give the Russian two unexpected break points. Nadal is then forced to work hard to get back into the game, a volleyed winner is followed up with a serve volley to make it deuce - that's nince out of 10 serve and volley points won by Nadal so far tonight.\n\nThat is then followed up by a shocking miss from the Spanaird - a part volley, part overhead is smashed wide to give Medvedev another break point. The Russian makes no mistake with the opportunity and has finally broken to give himself a glimmer of hope.\n\n11:37PM\n\nMedvedev is wilting under the relentless Nadal pressure\n\nTry as he might Medvedev has not found a way past the many weapons in Nadal's armoury Credit: Getty Images\n\n11:34PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 3-2 Medvedev (*next server) - Nadal breaks\n\nOnce again Nadal's forehands comes to the fore, a line drive giving Medvedev no chance to make it 30-30. He gets a sniff of a break which he doesn't pass up. He claims a break point which he makes good on after another rally from the baseline ends up with a forehand into the net from Medvedev.\n\nThe Russian has it all to do now and it is hard to see Nadal losing this.\n\n11:30PM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 2-2 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nWhat. A. Point.\n\nIt was brilliant tennis by Medvedev, there were times when the Russian was on top of another long rally, but Nadal quickly turns defence into attack with a bludgeoned forehand followed up with a delicate volleyed winner. There is little you can do when all your weapons are dealt with like that. Nadal goes on to win the game, once again showing there are no weaknesses in his game.\n\n11:23PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 1-2 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nAnother hold to love for Medvedev, winning with an ace. Those last two holds - both without Nadal winning a point - were vital.\n\n11:21PM\n\nNadal 7-5, 6-3, 1-1 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nFull marks to Medvedev he keeps on hustling on the longer rallies - he's actually won most of the rallies over nine shots tonight - but it still doesn't allow him to find a way to break Nadal's serve. He wins a long rally at the start of the game but Nadal then comes into the net winning with a volley before forcing another error from the Medvedev forehand after another good first serve.\n\n11:17PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 6-3, 0-1 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nAs with the first two sets Medvedev starts another set well. There is no let off in effort and he wins the game without too many problems.\n\n11:13PM\n\nDon't tell Medvedev, but...\n\n...Nadal has never lost a final when two sets up, and only lost twice ever with a two-set advantage.\n\nTwo sets up, surely the title is Nadal's... Credit: USA Today\n\n11:10PM\n\nNadal claims second set 6-3 - the favourite leads 7-5, 6-3 over Medvedev\n\nEven the very best get tight when serving for a set in a grand slam final. Nadal making an error to give Medvedev a 15-30 advantage. He responds brilliantly, though, winning the next three points - a volley, forcing a forehand error from Medvedev, then the same again after a long baseline battle - to claim a two-set lead.\n\nIt looks ominous for Medvedev now...\n\n11:04PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 5-3 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nJust what Medvedev needed - holding his serve to love. His most comfortable hold of the day.\n\nCan he now break Nadal's serve? He needs to...\n\n11:02PM\n\nNadal's lucky point\n\n11:01PM\n\nNadal 7-5, 5-2 Medvedev * (*next server)\n\nAs if Medvedev's task wasn't big enough all the luck seems to be going Nadal's way - the Spaniard rushes into the net to return a drop shot, his response hitting the top of the net twice before landing in Medvedev's half of the court for a winner.\n\nNadal's forehand is going up a gear, a line drive the very next point give his opponent no chance and the favourite sees out the game losing only one point.\n\nThis must be exhausting stuff for Medvedev, he's playing well but currently has no answer to the bullying brutality of Nadal.\n\n10:56PM\n\nSpot the celebs...\n\nSpotted at the men's singles final \ufffd\ufffd#USOpenpic.twitter.com/vJAknf5aOU \u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 8, 2019\n\n10:56PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 4-2 Medvedev (*next server) Nadal breaks\n\nNadal is happy to engage in long baseline rallies, a tactic that is working. He's relentless and again puts early pressure on Medvedev's serve getting to 0-30.\n\nIt's another uphill battle for the Russian and another baseline battle - defending and constructing the rally before turning defence into attack - gives Nadal two more break points. This time he makes them count, a forehand from Medvedev hitting the net to give the Spaniard the first break of the set.\n\n10:50PM\n\nNadal 7-5, 3-2 Medvedev * (*next server)\n\nAt the risk of creating a strong sense of deja-vu Nadal's serve is once again too dominant for Medvedev. Another easy hold for the favourite.\n\nNadal's serve has always been underestimated and its the weapon that's giving him a huge advantage tonight.\n\n10:46PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 2-2 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nA bad miss by Medvedev on the drive volley gives Nadal a 0-30 lead, that is followed up with another long forehand and Nadal has three break points.\n\nThe Russian, as he has done all night, will not lie down though, winning the next two points with a mixture of determination, composure and a strong forehand. He then makes it deuce with a solid backhand. It's deuce once more following another Nadal break point, and this time the Russian shows heart to hold onto his serve.\n\nMedvedev is showing some signs of tiredness but there is no doubting his competitive fire.\n\n10:40PM\n\nA sporting spectacle\n\nOne of the world's great sporting arenas...\n\nMedvedev is being made to work hard by Nadal Credit: REX\n\n10:39PM\n\nNadal 7-5, 2-1 Medvedev * (*next server)\n\nSince the fifth game Nadal's serve has been brilliant, Medvedev is having to work so hard on every point and he does just that in the third point as he rushes into the net to play a great winner down the line. He gets it to 30-30 with yet another display of grit and hard hitting from the baseline. The response is an ace from Nadal - as sure a sign of the Spaniard telling Medvedev not to get his hopes up as any we've seen so far tonight. Another world-class serve gives him the game.\n\nThe Russian is playing very well here but unless he can put more pressure on Nadal's serve he has no chance of victory.\n\n10:34PM\n\nNadal* 7-5, 1-1 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nMedvedev is trying everything here, showing great composure and competitive spirit. He holds relatively easily. Good early signs in the second set for the Russian.\n\n10:31PM\n\nNadal 7-5, 1-0 Medvedev * (*next server)\n\nMedvedev starts the second set well winning the first two points, before Nadal mounts a fightback. It goes to deuce before Nadal wraps it up with a great serve down the line which Medvedev does well to get a racquet to.\n\nMedvedev is playing well but finds himself a set down Credit: AP\n\n10:22PM\n\nNadal breaks to claim first set 7-5\n\nWhen Nadal gets a sniff of a break at 6-5 he, more often than not, makes it count. He gets to 0-30 thanks to some typically powerful forehands, then, with the score at 15-30, grinds Medvedev down with brilliant groundstrokes before unleashing the best forehand of the match for a winner.\n\nHe needed the two set points, dumping the first set point with a woeful sliced backhand into the net before claiming the first set 7-5 with the next point.\n\nMedvedev's task just got much harder - you felt he had to win that first set to have a chance of glory tonight.\n\n10:16PM\n\nNadal 6-5 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nNadal really is dominant on his serve, using all his experience to move the Russian around the court. But once again Medvedev continues to be brave coming into the net and showing Nadal he'll not fold easily. The Spaniard follows that tactic coming into the net to hold serve and put all the pressure back on to Medvedev with the first set on the line.\n\n10:11PM\n\nNadal* 5-5 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nThe rallies are getting shorter, both players probably needed it after that intense start. But having forced Nadal into two errors Medvedev then struggles to land a first serve, this gives Nadal the chance to get back to deuce. The Russian responds with an ace, following that up with another missed first serve.\n\nIt's a case of struggling to land a serve with the game at his mercy, then serving well when under pressure. It goes to deuce three times more with Medvedev once again coming into the net when the opportunity presents itself. He eventually holds on his seventh game point.\n\nMedvedev now needs to get stuck into Nadal's serve.\n\n10:03PM\n\nYoung fan supports the older player\n\nIt's fair to say most of the Arthur Ashe Stadium is behind Nadal this evening.\n\nA young fan of Nadal Credit: Getty Images\n\n10:01PM\n\nNadal 5-4 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nThe all-important ninth game goes to Nadal. With every game he is looking stronger and stronger on his serve. He again wins to love and has won 80 percent of his first serves.\n\nNadal has won 11 consecutive points on his serve\n\n9:59PM\n\nNadal* 4-4 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nErrors are beginning to creep into Medvedev's game. He makes unforced forehand errors twice in the first two points to give Nadal an advantage. In response to giving Nadal two break points the Russian twice comes into the net, the second time playing serve and volley - a sign that he is thinking clearly - to bring the game back to deuce. A double fault then gifts Nadal another break point, that is cancelled out by brilliant backhand winner by Medvedev, and he takes the game, despite four loose points - an impressive hold under a lot of pressure.\n\n9:52PM\n\nHollywood is here\n\nMichael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are both in attendance Credit: REX\n\n9:50PM\n\nNadal 4-3 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nMedvedev is looking to come into the net a bit more, trying to be more proactive. It's the right tactic but doesn't pay dividends this time around as Nadal bosses this game, once again winning to love.\n\n9:47PM\n\nNadal* 3-3 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nIt was important for Medvedev to hold serve there - he's looked nerveless so far in New York and that was the case having gone behind in the sixth game. Nadal still looks nervous, he misses long with the whole court at his mercy as the Russian equals things up.\n\n9:43PM\n\nNadal 3-2 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nThat's more like it from Nadal. Having started poorly on his serve this time he holds to love.\n\n9:42PM\n\nMedvedev looking composed\n\nThe Russian has made an impressive start to his first grand slam final Credit: Getty Images\n\n9:41PM\n\nNadal* 2-2 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nDespite being 0-30 up with a great chance for an immediate break back, Nadal, for all his experience, is looking the more edgy making an uncharacteristic forehand error. He steadies himself to get a break point and makes no mistake to back on level terms. There is a reason why he's the best in the business at breaking back.\n\n9:35PM\n\nNadal 1-2 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nBoth players are going toe-to-toe in terms of exchanging powerful groundstrokes - one 21- shot rally ends with a trademark overhead from Nadal. He is looking intense early on here, but once again Medvedev is looking confident. To give you an idea of how this match is starting, the average rally length is nine shots...That isn't bothering Medvedev who is hugging the baseline and he wins another break point and he makes this one count.\n\nEarly break for the young pretender...\n\nNadal finds himself and early break down Credit: Getty Images\n\n9:29PM\n\nNadal* 1-1 Medvedev (*next server)\n\nA much quicker game on Medvedev's serve sees the Russian win without too many problems. That will do his confidence the world of good.\n\n9:25PM\n\nNadal 1-0 Medvedev* (*next server)\n\nMedvedev goes long with a backhand first point of the game. That was a mundane start to the match that was more than lifted by the next point as the pair exchange a long baseline battle before Nadal lets rip with a forehand on the run for a brilliant winner. A double fault and an unforced error gets it back to 30-30. Medvedev, playing deep in the court, is then able to soak up the power and he gets a break point (only the 17th Nadal's had to face this tournament). The Spaniard uses all his experience to win the game but there are early signs that the Russian will not be overawed.\n\n9:18PM\n\nReady? Let's play\n\nThe final is underway and Nadal is serving.\n\n9:12PM\n\nNadal wins the toss and...\n\n...elects to serve first - he clearly wants to lay down the gauntlet and get an early lead.\n\n9:11PM\n\nThe players have arrived\n\nNadal is wearing his all black number while Medvedev will delight the traditionalists with his all-white garb.\n\n9:08PM\n\nThe pre-final ceremony is underway...\n\nDoes anyone enjoy these mawkish displays of patriotism/bad singing/I could go on..?\n\nThis one features four fighter jets flying over the Arthur Ashe Stadium - a bit too much?\n\nAnyway, I'll stop being a grumpy, cynical so-and-so. Not long to go now until the players - the reason everyone's eyes are focused on the court - appear.\n\n9:02PM\n\nPundits are giving the Russian little chance\n\nAnd it is not hard to see why...\n\n...A win for Nadal would carry him to 19 majors, one short of Federer\u2019s all-time record of 20, while adding further ballast to the argument that he is a true all-rounder: not just the clay-court bully.\n\nAs Medvedev put it in the interview room on Friday: \u201cHe [Nadal] is just a machine, a beast on the court.\u201d\n\nBut both players are willing to play the long game, happy to let rallies go on and grind down their opponent. Medvedev has shown this year he is willing to try new tactics but it will take a herculean effort to shock Nadal.\n\n8:57PM\n\nThe new McEnroe and Connors?\n\nFor those of you wanting a few more titbits about Medvedev he has just been described by Greg Rusedski as a volatile guy likely to let off stream and vent any frustration to the umpire and/or himself. In the words of Greg he's a 'bit like John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors'...\n\nThis could be interesting...\n\nConnors and McEnroe after both their heydays...

All this by the time he's 23, impressive.\n\nOh, and before arriving in New York his best performance in a Grand Slam was reaching the fourth round at this year's Australian Open.\n\nIf you want greater detail - understandable if you do - then read Simon Briggs' good piece revealing how Medvedev made it to his first grand slam final...\n\nMedvedev on his way to tonight's final Credit: AFP\n\n8:35PM\n\nFreebie fun\n\nOne of the many, many perks you get as US Open champion is a free trip to one of New York's best attractions - the Top of the Rock (the view is so much better than from the Empire State Building, yep, this blog is dishing out free travel advice as well as sporting updates - thank me later...). But having won $3.9 million last night, we're pretty sure Andreescu could have afforded the admission fee...\n\nThe new US Open champion at the Top of the Rock Credit: Getty Images\n\n8:31PM\n\nCan lightning strike twice?\n\nMedvedev need not go far too far back to draw some inspiration and belief that he can shock a giant of the game to claim a grand slam - only 24 hours to be precise.\n\nTeenager Bianca Andreescu stunned Serena Williams in another match up of youth verses experience to win the women's final.\n\nTo remind you, and Daniil on the very unlikely off chance he's reading this blog as well, of just how 19-year-old Andreescu beat Serena here is our very own Simon Briggs's report.\n\nSweet taste of success for Andreescu Credit: REX\n\n8:05PM\n\nGood evening tennis fans\n\nFaster than an Ivo Karlovic serve we have reached the last grand slam final of the year and as predictable as night following day and a Nick Kyrgios tantrum one of the big three - Rafael Nadal in this case - is in it.\n\nWhat fewer people would have bet on before the action got underway at Flushing Meadows is his opponent. Step forward Daniil Medvedev.\n\nOnce heralded as one of the more impressive of the much-heralded NextGen (slick marketing-speak for the group of young guns born in the mid-1990s), the 6ft 6in Russian stormed back to form this summer when he reached the finals of Washington and Montreal before landing his first ATP Masters title in Cincinnati.\n\nCan Medvedev continue his fine form of the summer and claim the US Open title? Credit: AFP\n\nHe carried that run into the US Open, seeing off the challenges of, among others, Feliciano Lopez, Stan Wawrinka and Grigor Dimitrov, to make tonight's final losing only four sets in the process.\n\nHe has put down the reason for his resurgence down to one thing - consistency.\n\nNadal's presence in the Flushing Meadows face-off has not only been more predictable but also more stress free. The three-time US Open champion has only lost one set and an average of 10 games with each win along the way.\n\nCan Medvedev shock the Spaniard to claim his first slam success, or will Nadal make it grand slam no 19?\n\nStay here to find out...", "description": "1:29AM Nadal knows he's in one hell of a fight a CLUTCH hold from Nadal after saving 3 break points in his opening service game in the 5th set...USOpenpic.twitter.com/nSeKCC1TGu\u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 9, 2019 1:28AM Nadal 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 2-2 Medvedev* (*next server)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We're", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/srIgK.sMdNXe.KyBzEu7Jg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TOhLRilyjSPAZGyIX4xGBQ--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/3c44502ad730d398302c95dfd9ee966c", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
