Having 50 square feet onboard feels super luxurious.\n\n\"And because I had no neighbour next to me they also gave me the other half, so I had 100 square feet to myself.\"\n\nJean explained that the two suites at the back are solo suites, while the other four suites can be converted into a double room by lifting the sliding door.\n\n(Image: The Points Guy UK)\n\n(Image: The Points Guy UK)\n\nBut as much as he found the service 'incredible' and 'super friendly', he revealed there was not a public area to relax unlike the Emirates and Etihad.\n\nHe continued: \"There are no showers like on the Emirates A380 and Etihad A380. It was better than I was expecting.\n\n\"The crew were even nicer, food was much better, drinks were flowing, and the cabin was bigger than I thought. It was the best flight of my life.\"\n\n(Image: The Points Guy UK)\n\nA single flight from London to Singapore is around \u00a35,000 but you can also pay part of it with mile points.\n\nNicky Kelvin, director of content at The Points Guy UK, was able to book the Singapore Suites for as little as \u00a319, with roughly 125,000 KrisFlyer points.\n\nFor more information on travel tips and tricks, sign up to The Points Guy UK .", "description": "A travel expert from The Points Guy UK flew the award-winning Suites Class from Heathrow with Singapore Airlines on an Airbus A380", "authors": ["Tiffany Lo", "Image", "The Points Guy Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658210.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The_Points_Guy5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
