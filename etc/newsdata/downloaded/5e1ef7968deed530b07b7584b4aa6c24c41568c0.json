I'm happy he (initially) stayed in the Championship to defend his club.\n\n'He's a talented player who always creates something. An exceptional player but too expensive for Manchester!'\n\nThe claim comes a surprise considering the financial firepower seemingly at Guardiola's disposal at the Etihad, with City's squad almost completely made up of big-money signings.\n\nGrealish was at the heart of Villa's promotion-winning campaign last season and has settled in comfortably to life back in the Premier League which has led him to be named as a potential target for the league's big clubs.\n\nFormer Villa boss Tim Sherwood recently praised his former player, saying that clubs such as Manchester United be targeting Grealish at a price of \u00a370million.\n\nGrealish put in a spirited display for the Villans despite the tough opposition he faced, and the fact that the 24-year-old was forced off through injury will be a cause for concern for Villa boss Dean Smith.", "description": "Pep Guardiola claimed Aston Villa's Jack Grealish is 'too expensive' for Manchester City to sign him.
