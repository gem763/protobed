Tallinn\u2019s Fotografiska gallery has been ordered to take down a billboard featuring the images that was advertising the exhibition. The ruling does not affect the display inside the gallery.\n\n\u201cEveryone has the right and freedom of choice to visit a photo exhibition and view works exhibited there, but the same cannot be said for displaying the same art exhibition works in outdoor advertising spaces which could be seen by minors,\u201d Kairi Vaher, the head of the city\u2019s business authority, told local media.\n\nAccording to Estonian law, adverts can be banned on grounds of obscenity or using images of people as sexualised objects, as well as for using images of people without their consent. The city authorities believe the exhibition adverts violate the law.\n\nMargit Aasm\u00e4e, the chief executive of Fotografiska, said the gallery would comply with the ruling but believed it to be misplaced.\n\n\u201cThe issue is broader: in our digital world you can find photographs with much more nudity, even on serious news channels, as well as false information which could reach even more people than our adverts for the exhibition,\u201d she told the local news site Delfi. She said the adverts included text explaining that they were not real images.\n\nThe gallery plans to replace the billboards with plain-text signs reading \u201cTruth is dead\u201d \u2013 the name of Jackson\u2019s exhibition.\n\nOther creations by the artist have included a photograph of Silvio Berlusconi massaging Angela Merkel\u2019s shoulders, and a video of an Osama bin Laden lookalike singing Poker Face by Lady Gaga. Jackson has said one of the goals of her work is to explore how photography is often a \u201cdeceitful medium\u201d.", "description": "Adverts with \u2018photographs\u2019 by UK artist Alison Jackson deemed to have broken law", "authors": ["Shaun Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d4551b4a903fc9108cb66fe942d072ba38455e3/0_52_2139_1282/master/2139.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b7fcfbaedd3c2107b5caffb6a8c100b", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
