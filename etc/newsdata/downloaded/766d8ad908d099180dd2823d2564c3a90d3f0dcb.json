REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nThe Olympic champion suffered the injury while playing a charity touch rugby game in October 2017 and has not raced internationally since.\n\nThe 27-year-old South African recently returned to training after enduring a number of setbacks, but says he is in no rush to return to competition as he looks forward to the next Olympics in Tokyo in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still positive and I\u2019m just taking things day by day, respecting all the calls made by the doctors and respecting my body,\u201d Van Niekerk said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s just about listening to my body and taking it from there. My main goal is to look after my body and when the opportunity comes, I\u2019ll take it.\n\n\u201cFor now I\u2019m not rushing myself or putting pressure on myself. I\u2019m extremely happy and at peace with where I am.\u201d\n\nHis doctor Louis Holtzhausen, who has been leading Van Niekerk\u2019s recovery over the last two years, believes it will move more rapidly in the coming months.\n\n\u201cThe medical teams, both in Bloemfontein and Aspetar (Qatar), did all we could to have him ready for the World Championships, but it was just not possible,\u201d Holtzhausen said.\n\n\u201cHowever, he has successfully returned to track training and all indications are that he will recover more rapidly from now on.\u201d\n\nVan Niekerk had hoped to run at the South African championships in April but pulled out and also skipped a proposed return at the London Diamond League in July after suffering a bruise on the bone in his knee.\n\nVan Niekerk beat Michael Johnson\u2019s 17-year world record in the 400-m at the 2016 Olympics and was set to take on the 200-m as well before his injury.\n\nHe also won gold in the World Championships in Beijing in 2015.", "description": "World record holder Wayde van Niekerk said he would not defend his 400-metres title at this month's World Championships in Doha as he has yet to recover from a knee injury.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425380941&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810WO-OZASP"}
