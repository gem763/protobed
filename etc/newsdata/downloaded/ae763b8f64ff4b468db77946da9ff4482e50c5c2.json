A firebomb was tossed at one subway station.\n\nThe protesters tore off stones from the sidewalk and scattered them on the road, commandeered plastic safety barriers and unscrewed metal railings to form makeshift roadblocks.\n\nPolice fired tear gas after gasoline bombs were thrown toward one subway station as tens of thousands of demonstrators marched down a main road with traffic at a standstill. They sang the protest movement\u2019s anthem and held up placards depicting the Chinese flag as a Nazi swastika.\n\nMatthew lee, a university student, said he was determined to keep protesting even after more than four months.\n\n\u201cI can see some people want to give up, but I don\u2019t want to do this because Hong Kong is my home, we want to protect this place, protect Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t give up because Hong Kong is your home\u201d\n\nMany of the protesters wore masks in defiance of a recently introduced ban on face coverings at public gatherings, and volunteers handed more out to the crowd.\n\nOrganizers said they wanted to use their right to protest as guaranteed by the city\u2019s constitution despite the risk of arrest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using peaceful, rational, nonviolent ways to voice our demands,\u201d Figo Chan, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of being arrested. What I\u2019m most scared of is everyone giving up on our principles.\u201d\n\nThe group has organized some of the movement\u2019s biggest protest marches. One of its leaders, Jimmy Sham, was attacked on Wednesday by assailants wielding hammers.\n\nOn Saturday, Hong Kong police arrested a 22-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing a teenage activist who was distributing leaflets near a wall plastered with pro-democracy messages. A witness told local broadcaster RTHK that the assailant shouted afterward that Hong Kong is \u201ca part of China\u201d and other pro-Beijing messages.\n\nThe movement sprang out of opposition to a government proposal for an extradition bill that would have sent suspects to stand trial in mainland China, and then ballooned into broader demands for full democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.", "description": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hong Kong protesters flooded the city's streets on Sunday in defiance of a ban by the authorities on their march, setting up roadblocks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/20/a3da11_hong-kong-protests-85809-protester-throws-molotov-cocktail-police-station-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
