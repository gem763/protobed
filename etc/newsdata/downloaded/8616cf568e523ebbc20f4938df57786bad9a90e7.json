USA TODAY\n\nNew England Patriots linebacker Elandon Roberts got out of his Porsche with his hands up.\n\n\u201cThis is my house,\u201d Roberts told the deputy from the Fort Bend County (Texas) Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nDeputy Adam Watkins barked at Roberts to get back into his car and Roberts did so quickly, not that it halted the tension as Watkins called for backup over the \u201cbig black man\u201d who \u201cwouldn\u2019t comply,\u201d according to the dashcam footage obtained by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nElandon Roberts has started 30 games at linebacker for the New England Patriots over the past three seasons. (Photo: Greg M. Cooper, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nRoberts was stopped in the Houston suburb of Richmond on March 10 for a basic speeding infraction, but he wasn't told of the charge until nine minutes after the stop was initiated.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these types of things are happening all too often to African Americans,\u201d Roberts said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. \u201cPeople are becoming desensitized to them. Being harassed in your own yard simply because you are a 'big black man\u2019 should never become the norm. To the person being harassed, it is frightening, disrespectful and embarrassing.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in any financial gain from releasing this story. My only hope is that these types of bias-based traffic stops can end and that, perhaps, other black drivers might see how to deescalate a threatening situation.\u201d\n\nNFL ARRESTS: View a searchable database of players arrested since 2000\n\nRoberts filed a complaint 10 days after the incident in which he wrote he \u201cfelt so harassed I couldn\u2019t even remember where my insurance paper was in my car.\u201d\n\nIn a response from the Fort Bend County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s internal affairs division dated May 20, a department official wrote the complaint was \u201cnot sustained,\u201d or not acted upon by the department, and the matter was closed. The document did note that a supervisor was instructed to \u201cgo through refresher training on traffic stop procedures\u201d with Watkins.\n\nRoberts\u2019 attorney, Jennine Hovell-Cox, told USA TODAY Sports she has requested that the Fort Bend County District Attorney open an investigation into the incident.\n\n\u201cMy office directed her to contact the Internal Affairs Division at the Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d Fort Bend County District Attorney Brian M. Middleton said in an email to USA TODAY Sports. \u201cIf Mr. Roberts files a formal complaint, the matter will be investigated and possibly referred to the Texas Rangers for an independent investigation.\u201d\n\nFort Bend County Sheriff\u2019s Department did not provide comment on the incident when reached by USA TODAY Sports Thursday.\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVE: Black NFL players arrested nearly 10 times as often as whites\n\n\u201cAs a son, husband, and father, I share the concerns and fear of many,\u201d said Kennard McGuire, Roberts' agent. \u201cWe shouldn't have to move in fear of those with the privilege and honor to protect and serve.\u201d\n\nRoberts, 25, didn\u2019t argue. The two-time Super Bowl champ and native Texan followed instructions and, at one point, even pleaded with Watkins.\n\n\"Can we talk like men?\" Roberts said during the stop.\n\nHowever, Watkins delivered a different version of events on the radio.\n\n\"I haven't even begun the traffic stop,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cThe big black man who was driving got out of the car. I told him to get back in. He wouldn't comply. I had to yell at him pretty hard to comply.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 wife, Tori Roberts, came out of the house but was told by Watkins to return.\n\n\u201cThis is our house,\u201d Tori Roberts responded.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get back in the house, you will be arrested,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cGo back in the house for your safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor my safety or my husband\u2019s (safety)?\u201d Tori Roberts responded.\n\nThe dashcam footage showed Watkins telling Roberts he was stopped for speeding: 59 mph in a 35 mph zone and failure to provide insurance. A search of court records didn\u2019t show the citation was entered. Middleton said that his office \u201chas not received any charges from the sheriff\u2019s department regarding the incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe citation was never processed by the sheriff's department and sent for filing with the court,\u201d said Hovell-Cox, Robert\u2019s attorney. \u201cWe believe that once the dashcam footage was seen by Deputy Watkins' supervisors and realizing who Elandon is, a decision was made to halt everything. Elandon started receiving phone calls from the sheriff's office a few hours after the \u2018stop,\u2019 apologizing and telling him that the ticket was being \u2018dismissed.\u2019 \u201d\n\nContributing: Jarrett Bell", "description": "Patriots linebacker Elandon Roberts was stopped at his house in March for speeding, and has since filed a complaint against the officer.", "authors": ["A.J.
