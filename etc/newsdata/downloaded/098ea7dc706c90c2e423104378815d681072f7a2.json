In Italy we use some \u2018ways\u2019 only to \u2018help our teams\u2019 and to try to make our opponents nervous, not for racism but to mess them up.\n\n\u201cWe are a multi-ethnic fans organisation and we have always welcomed players from everywhere.\n\n\u201cHowever, we have always used that \u2018way\u2019 with other teams' players in the past and we probably will in the future. We are not racist and so are not the Cagliari fans.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand that in all Italian stadiums people cheer for their teams but at the same time they use to cheer against the opponents not for racism but to \"help\" their own team.\n\n\u201cPlease consider this attitude of Italian fans as a form of respect for the fact they are afraid of you for the goals you might score against their teams and not because they hate you or they are racist.\n\n\u201cTrue racism is a completely different story and all Italian football fans know it very well.\n\n\u201cWhen you declare that racism is a problem to be fought in Italy you just help the repression against all football fans including us and you contribute to create a problem that is not really there, not in the way that is perceived in other countries.\n\n\u201cWe are very sensitive and inclusive with all people. We guarantee you that in our organisation there are many fans of different races or fans coming from other parts of Italy that also use this ways to provoke their opponents even when the have the same races or are coming from the same areas.\n\n\u201cPlease help us to clarify what racism really is and that Italian fans are not racist.\n\n\u201cThe fight to REAL racism has to begin in schools not in the stadiums, fans are just fans and they behave in different ways when inside the stadium as opposed to when they are in real life.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you that what they do or say to an opponent player of another race is not what they would ever say to someone they would meet in real life.\n\n\u201cItalian fans may not be perfect and we can understand your frustration with this expressions but they are definitely not meant to be racist.\u201d\n\nThe letter appeared after Lukaku issued a statement on Instagram following the racist chants he received after scoring a penalty in Inter\u2019s 2-1 victory at Cagliari on Sunday.\n\n\u201cMany players in the last month have suffered from racial abuse,\u201d Lukaku wrote on Monday. \u201cI did yesterday too. Football is a game to be enjoyed by everyone and we shouldn't accept any form of discrimination that will put our game in shame.\n\n\u201cI hope the football federations all over the world react strongly on all cases of discrimination!!!\n\n\u201cSocial media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook...) need to work better as well with football clubs because every day you see at least a racist comment under a post of a person or colour... we've been saying it for years and still no action...\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen it's 2019. Instead of going forward we're going backwards and I think as players we need to unify and make a statement on this matter to keep this game clean and enjoyable for everyone.\u201d\n\nLukaku\u2019s abuse follows similar treatment to Everton\u2019s Moise Kean, who was targeted by Cagliari fans when playing for Juventus last season, yet Serie A took no action against the club because it had an \u201cobjectively limited relevance\u201d. In the past, Samuel Eto\u2019o, Sulley Muntari and Blaise Matuidi have all been racially abused when playing against Cagliari over the last decade.", "description": "Inter Milan \u2018ultras\u2019 have written an appalling letter to the club\u2019s striker Romelu Lukaku that claims the monkey chants that he was subjected to during the weekend\u2019s Serie A clash with Cagliari were \u201cnot racist\u201d but a \u201cform of respect\u201d.
