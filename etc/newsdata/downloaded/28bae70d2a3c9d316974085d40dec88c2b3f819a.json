I just remember sliding on my knees and getting carried away a bit.\n\n(Image: Man Utd via Getty Images)\n\n\"It's become a little bit of a wind up for the Mancunians because they've obviously given me so much stick over the years, it's just to wind them up a bit.\"\n\nLiverpool go into Sunday's clash as firm favourites as they bid to rack up a record-equalling 18th consecutive Premier League win.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side are eight wins from eight so far this campaign, while United are stranded in the bottom half of the table.\n\n(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\nAnd despite United's recent plight, Gerrard was adamant that this is still the one everyone wants to watch.\n\n\"It's exciting. It's a fascinating fixture, he added. \"The fixture that you look for at the beginning of the season, home and away.\n\n\"It's huge. It's the biggest game in Britain and around the world and it actually feels like that in the build-up.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut Gerrard warned his old club they must keep their eyes on the prize and not take anything for granted.\n\n\"I think that's what you've always got to remember, whether you're a player or the staff, it's the three points that are the key,\" Gerrard added.\n\n\"It can get built up a bit by the TV, but it's a tough fixture. It's the fixture for me, along with the Merseyside derby, that sometimes form can go out the window.\n\n\"Liverpool have managed to be the best team over the last few years, but even last year, they only managed to get a draw.\n\n\"I think Manchester United were there for the taking last year.\n\n\"I think if Liverpool get that opportunity again they've got to go for it and put their foot on the accelerator because this is a Man Utd team that isn't in form, they have had issues and it won't be like this forever, so you've got to strike when you get the chance.\"", "description": "The former Reds skipper scored twice in the 2014 meeting between the sides in Liverpool's last win at Old Trafford", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Man Utd Via Getty Images", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659450.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-Premier-League-TV-Cameras.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
