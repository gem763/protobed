On Aug. 10, a group of farmers and so-called landgrabbers reportedly planned a coordinated effort to set fire to the forests.\n\nIt's being called the Day of Fire.\n\n\"They wanted to show the president that they were supporting [his] politics,\" said Ramos, advocacy coordinator with the Socio-Environmental Institute in Brazil working to advance Indigenous rights.\n\nThe more than 75,000 fires across the Amazon this year have drawn international concern. At the G7 summit last weekend, the leaders promised $20 million of international funding to help fight the fires.\n\nJustin Trudeau promised to send $15 million and water bombers to help Brazil and other South American countries dealing with the fires.\n\nAn aerial view of a burning tract of Amazon jungle near Porto Velho, Brazil.

They clear the area around their villages so the fires have nothing to burn in order to protect their homes.\n\nBut the scale of these fires bring different issues. Ramos says the smoke is creating health concerns for people living in the area and there's a risk to crops outside the villages.\n\n\"There is the risk of losing everything they have planted, and also a huge impact on [the] biodiversity they rely on,\" she told Day 6 guest host Saroja Coelho.\n\n\"Also, if they leave, they are opening the space for those that have illegally created the fire so that they can try to occupy the communities' lands.\"\n\nFire burns a tract of Amazon jungle, cleared by loggers and farmers near Altamira, Brazil. (Nacho Doce/Reuters)\n\nWhat do we know about how the fires started?\n\nAccording to Ramos, controlled burns are not uncommon in the region.\n\n\"There is this normal dynamic in agriculture in Brazil, in the Amazon, which is called slash and burn,\" she said. This is where people deforest land and then set fires to clear out anything that's left so they can begin planting.\n\n\"This is normally something that is done in a controlled way,\" said Ramos.\n\nWhat was different this year was the coordinated effort of the Day of Fire, which Ramos says federal prosecutors are now investigating.\n\nWhat's behind this conflict over Indigenous land claims?\n\nThere has been a long history of conflict between Indigenous people and land developers since explorers first landed in Brazil, says Ramos.\n\n\"I think that this comes from when Brazil was first found by the Portuguese, so it's something historical,\" she said.\n\nBut, she added that since 2000, Brazil's crop exportation increased and so did the political power of the people who worked in that sector.\n\nShe says they started \"trying to reduce the creation of environmental legislation and the implementation of the rights of Indigenous people.\"\n\n\"The conflicts have been growing,\" said Ramos.\n\nHow has Bolsonaro's election influenced deforestation?\n\nBolsonaro campaigned against Indigenous land claims during his bid for presidency last year. He favoured development in the region.\n\nSoon after his election, he made the Minister of Agriculture responsible for Indigenous land claims, and said those lands should be opened for development.\n\n\"Brazil has legislation that still allows deforestation in the Amazon, in certain areas,\" said Ramos. \"But in fact the majority, almost 95 per cent of all deforestation, is illegal.\"\n\nShe says the country had been establishing policies aimed at reducing deforestation, and they were successful \u2014 for a while.\n\n\"The point is that the government has been almost defending the right to deforest, and the president has an approach against the conservation policies, against Indigenous people,\" said Ramos.\n\nShe says Bolsonaro has signaled to land developers that he will not enforce environmental laws, and the BBC reports that since he came to power, fines for environmental crimes have dropped.\n\nIndigenous people from the Mura tribe show a deforested area in unmarked indigenous lands inside the Amazon rainforest. (Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters)\n\nHow are Indigenous communities responding?\n\n\"Communities have been organizing themselves, in many cases, to guarantee that their areas are not invaded,\" Ramos said.\n\nShe says the lands are taken over most often for logging and for gold mining.\n\n\"Indigenous people try to get support from the government, but at moment, that is almost impossible,\" said Ramos. Instead, they're taking it upon themselves to patrol their territories.\n\n\"What we have seen is a group of Indigenous people in the Munduruku Indigenous lands, have managed to put the invaders out of their territories,\" said Ramos. She says they put a group of women out in front in order to avoid conflict, \"and just guarantee that the people would run from them.\"\n\n\"But there are also many situations in which that comes into a violent conflict and that Indigenous leaders are murdered,\" she said.\n\nWill the confrontations continue?\n\nAs the fires get closer to Indigenous lands, Ramos says it will become very dangerous.\n\n\"But we are also relying on all this public visibility of the issue to guarantee that the state governments and other agencies of the government will start to take care [of] it,\" she said.", "description": "Indigenous people and activists say loggers, miners and cattle ranchers are being emboldened by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to clear cut the Amazon rainforest \u2014 sometimes with fire.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5266212.1567196916!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/brazil-environment-wildfires.jpg"}
