Analysts said that no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d was necessary for the solicitation by Trump to be inappropriate and illegal \u2013 and also, there is a clear quid pro quo being negotiated.\n\nAccording to the summary, Trump begins the call by highlighting US aid for Ukraine, which he had suspended without clear explanation in advance of the call. \u201cWe spend a lot of effort and a lot of time,\u201d Trump says \u2013 but then he suggests Ukraine isn\u2019t doing enough in return.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been very, very good to Ukraine,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily \u2026\u201d\n\nThen Zelenskiy says Ukraine wants to buy more Javelin missiles from the United States, and Trump replies: \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.\u201d\n\n3) It\u2019s not a \u2018transcript\u2019 \u2013 and there appear to be significant elisions\n\nWhile Trump and his allies are referring to the call summary as a transcript, it is not. Instead, the document is a \u201cmemorandum of telephone conversation\u201d kept by notetakers in the White House situation room. A note on the document advises: \u201cA memorandum of a telephone conversation (Telcon) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion\u201d and warns \u201ca number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record\u201d.\n\nProsecutors emphasized that beyond the call summary, it was paramount for Congress to obtain an unredacted version of a report filed by a whistleblower about Trump\u2019s Ukraine contacts, because the report probably contains additional information and context not available in the summary.\n\nBut the summary itself appears to omit potentially valuable material. Previous reporting on the call had Trump pressing Zelenskiy about Biden \u201ceight times\u201d \u2013 more than represented in the call summary.\n\nThe summary also includes a single ellipsis, coming just when Trump explicitly asks Zelenskiy to \u201clook into\u201d Biden.\n\nA tweet that raised questions about that ellipsis was retweeted Wednesday by a lawyer for the whistleblower, Mark S Zaid.\n\n4) Trump describes past and future coordination\n\nIn the call summary, Trump lays out a plan for cooperation with Ukraine against Biden and Democrats that includes past conversations with Giuliani and future anticipated meetings, with Trump extending an invitation to Washington and Zelenskiy inviting the president to Kyiv. The extent of that planning could make it more difficult for Trump in the future to deny or cast doubt on the intentions behind the call, on his side.\n\n5) Trump does not talk about US regional interests\n\nOne key takeaway from the call summary is what was not part of the conversation. Trump does not discuss with Zelenskiy the countries\u2019 supposedly aligned policies on Russia and counter-terrorism. They don\u2019t discuss Nato, in which Ukraine has in the past sought membership, or energy policy, apart from a mention by Zelenskiy that Ukraine buys US oil.\n\nTrump is focused on two things: Biden, and the US firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the last election to analyze an infiltration of DNC email networks. Trump makes a reference to CrowdStrike servers being inside Ukraine, apparently based on a conspiracy theory separate from the Hunter Biden one. So on Trump\u2019s side, the conversation was used to pursue two conspiracy theories.\n\nOn Zelenskiy\u2019s side, the main objective seems to be to flatter Trump into submission.", "description": "The White House released a summary of Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy that lies at the heart of the impeachment inquiry", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf45d887a80e218858b3b867abe8e3e366615576/0_224_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c5072ae32fd3746365c342ec666ebdb", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
