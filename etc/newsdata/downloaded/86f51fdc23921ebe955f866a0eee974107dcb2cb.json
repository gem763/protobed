Captivated by the city\u2019s fog and landscape from the vantage point of the balcony of the Savoy Hotel, the French painter composed more than 100 paintings of London, including the Houses of Parliament, Waterloo Bridge, and a series of 37 canvases of Charing Cross Bridge.\n\nWith a signature use of evanescent mix of color, light, and shadow, Monet\u2019s London paintings are among the world\u2019s most recognizable impressionist paintings.\n\nMany examples of Charing Cross Bridge are held in the collections of institutions, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Those in private hands rarely appear at auction, Sotheby\u2019s said.\n\nThis March, a Monet painting of Charing Cross Bridge reportedly changed hands in a private transaction in the U.K. for $63 million.\n\nThe painting offered for sale at Sotheby\u2019s has been inthe private collection of Andrea Klepetar-Fallek for more than 40 years. She died this May at age 99.\n\nAndrea Klepetar-Fallek Courtesy of Sotheby's\n\nBorn in Austria in 1920, Klepetar-Fallek moved to Yugoslavia on the eve of World War II. She survived the Holocaust while crisscrossing through Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Italy. She continued to move around the globe and lived in Israel, Argentina, Switzerland, and, finally, New York City.\n\nShe married four times. With her late husband Fred Fallek, she assembled a collection of paintings, drawings, and sculptures, including works by Pierre Bonnard, Lyonel Feininger, Jacques Lipchitz, Emil Nolde, Edgar Degas, and more. The collection will be offered across both of Sotheby\u2019s evening and day sales of impressionist and modern art on Nov. 12 and 13, respectively.\n\nAll pieces from the collection will be on public view at Sotheby\u2019s New York galleries from Nov. 1 to 12.\n\nMonet\u2019s auction record was set this May, when an exceptional example of his famed Haystacks pictures netted $110.7 million at Sotheby\u2019s.", "description": "The painting will be offered for the first time in more than 40 years", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-116211/social", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
