After all, its conclusion was that such prospects are slim indeed.\n\nBut in focusing on raw numbers, the report lacks some important context.\n\nYes, the size of a military, the technologies it brings to battle and how it is positioned are key factors when assessing the prospect of victory. But such metrics do not tell the whole story, and the current spate of hand-wringing, while understandable, should not lead to fatal pessimism.\n\nChina holds many advantages when one considers sheer numbers, the geography and distances involved, and the bases and airfields in the Indo-Pacific region currently used by the U.S. military. It possesses a navy larger than the United States, not counting its \u201chidden fleet.\u201d On its current course, China will have upwards of 560 ships and submarines by the mid-2030s to the U.S. Navy\u2019s projected 355.\n\nMuch has also been made of the risks posed to U.S. bases in the region by China\u2019s investments in an assortment of missiles. So yes, on the face of it, the odds are stacked against the United States.\n\nBut often underreported, if mentioned at all, is the importance of experience in warfighting. It is one thing to train a force for war and quite another to use it in a real battle. The last time China engaged in a war of any sort was against Vietnam in 1979, 40 years ago; it lasted barely one month, was almost exclusively land-based, was conducted across a common border, and was largely considered a loss for China. And the last time China engaged in a naval battle, it was soundly defeated by the Japanese in the Battle of the Yalu River in 1894.\n\nOn the one hand, the Chinese are very aware of their lack of real-world experience, hence their study of U.S. operations since the end of the Cold War. But on the other, it takes such experience against a capable opponent, when operations cannot be scripted and one\u2019s plans are being thwarted by an enemy, to learn what it really takes to prevail.\n\nThe United States has been conducting military operations large and small, in many settings, against many different types of opponents, with a dizzying variety of equipment and supporting systems, and at great distance from home for decades. No other country comes close to the experience accumulated by the U.S. military.\n\nAnd while experience is somewhat ephemeral as individual people leave the military and are replaced by others, the accumulated experiences shape the culture of the services, inform doctrine and \u201cbest practices,\u201d and provide the basis for the types of equipment and systems and how they are used in operations. Further, they provide the intangible understanding that battle brings surprises and that the first shots of the war do not determine the final outcome.\n\nYes, the U.S. military is two-thirds the size it was at the end of the Cold War, is stretched to accomplish all of the tasks assigned it to address America\u2019s security concerns globally and is faced by mounting financial challenges that call into question whether it can effectively modernize its portfolio of equipment that has been prematurely aged by 18 years of near-constant operations since the terrorist attacks of 9/11. But if faced with a war against China, the military would globally source all of the assets and people it would need to defend core U.S. national interests, and it would leverage decades of warfighting experience and the professionalism of its people to win that fight.\n\nThe United States has built global distribution and support systems and an extraordinary ability to share information across service lines and with allies. It has more than a half-century of experience in combining all sorts of weapons and tools to defeat enemy efforts and to achieve military objectives. And it is populated by talented men and women who come from a society that prizes individual initiative, innovation, truly collaborative teamwork and trust. Lastly, the United States has a long history of marshaling the support of friends and allies in common cause to stand against threatening, authoritarian regimes.\n\nChina has little depth or experience in any of these areas and poses the sort of threat that would rally regional states to join with the United States. While numbers and position favor China\u2019s hand in the current conditions of peace, conditions will change in war and it is in that cauldron that the American military would have the upper hand.\n\nThe United States should never be counted out before bullets start flying. Americans and our allies should take heart in this, and our competitors should take great care in assuming otherwise.\n\n\u2022 Dakota Wood is a senior research fellow for defense programs in the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign and National Security Policy at The Heritage Foundation (heritage.org).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
