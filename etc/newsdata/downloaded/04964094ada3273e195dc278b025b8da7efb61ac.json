But a seven-year drought has threatened the viability of the valley\u2019s farmland, and many rural communities have suffered greatly as a result.\n\nJoris Debeij\u2019s short documentary When a Town Runs Dry offers a window into the front lines of the water crisis. In the film, which is based on Diana Marcum\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning reporting, we hear from several residents of Stratford, a farming community in which much of the land was decimated by the drought.\n\n\u201cBeing able to work with the ground and with nature has been very satisfying,\u201d says one farmer, \u201cbut of late, when the water becomes scarce, we don\u2019t get a lot of help from the people who want the food that we grow.\u201d The man, who inherited the farm from his father, has been forced to sell land as a result of the aridity. \u201cThis year, half of the farm has not been put into cultivation, because of a lack of water,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout food production, there\u2019s no jobs out in the rural communities.\u201d\n\nAnother longtime Stratford resident describes feeling helpless in the face of the changing climate. \u201cYou don\u2019t start thinking about reality until you start seeing the writing on the wall,\u201d he says.\n\nEmmanuel Vaughan-Lee, who produced the film, told me that he was impressed with the townspeople\u2019s resilience in the face of the dire conditions in the region.\n\n\u201cIn bigger cities, we are often insulated from the direct impacts of climate change and how it affects our immediate environments,\u201d Vaughan-Lee said. \u201cWe see hotter days, erratic weather, and, most recently, fires\u2014but we aren\u2019t as close to the front lines as many of these smaller towns and communities.\u201d\n\nFortunately, the California drought has relented in recent months. But many believe this to be a short-lived respite. \u201cThe aquifer in the Central Valley is being depleted at a rate much higher than can be replenished by rains, so it\u2019s only a matter of time before farming becomes unviable,\u201d Vaughan-Lee said. \u201cWhen this happens, many towns in the Central Valley may not survive.\u201d", "description": "In California\u2019s Central Valley, residents cope with the devastation of a water crisis and the uncertainty of their future.", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019_10_08_at_10.13.24_AM/video-featured.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
