REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo\n\nAs a result, the Fed \u201cmay choose to provide additional accommodation going forward, but decisions will be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis,\u201d he said in remarks to a conference in London on Tuesday.\n\nBullard did not specifically discuss the preliminary trade deal reached between the United States and China last week, instead stressing that the uncertainty around global trade was likely to last, potentially for years.\n\nDaily threats and counter-threats in the trade war, or announcements or rejections of tentative deals, \u201care just the manifestations of ongoing negotiations and manifestations of the trade regime uncertainty,\u201d Bullard said of the U.S.-China row.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not expecting any of this to go away in the years ahead,\u201d he added, later telling reporters that the tensions had opened a \u201cPandora\u2019s box\u201d on a potential reversal of global trade openness.\n\nBullard also outlined the Fed\u2019s playbook for dealing with a potential \u201cordinary recession\u201d. He said the options to slash borrowing rates to zero, restart assets purchases and provide supportive policy promises, were still \u201cstate of the art\u201d.\n\nBut negative interest rates, adopted in large parts of Europe and Japan since the global financial crisis, were not on his list.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of this policy. Negative interest rates have had mixed results where they\u2019ve been tried,\u201d he said, adding that it was not clear either how multi-trillion dollar U.S. money markets would adapt to such a policy.\n\nBullard is generally seen as one of the more dovish Fed policymakers. When the central bank reduced interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in September, he argued for a deeper half-point cut.\n\nHowever, in his speech on Tuesday he did flag that if the risks now facing the world\u2019s largest economy turn out to have been overstated, the Fed might actually start raising rates again next year.\n\nHe also expressed hope that the recent switch back to rate cuts may have fended off a recession in the near term.\n\n\u201cWe are lowering the policy rate today, we are taking on board downside risk, but we can take back that insurance in 2020 or 2021 if it turns out we were overly worried about the downside risks.\u201d\n\nHe also sketched plans for the Fed to start new \u2018repo\u2019 funding operations in the wake of recent money market troubles caused by sudden surges in demand for cash.\n\nThe idea would be to give banks more opportunity to access Fed funding. \u201cI am hoping we will go to a repo facility,\u201d Bullard said, adding something could be in place in six months.\n\n\u201cWith that you won\u2019t have this issue of the policy rate trading outside the (Fed policymaking) committee\u2019s range.\u201d\n\nFor speech slides click here www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/bullard/remarks/2019/bullard_bloomberg_tv_mmf_london_15_october_2019.pdf?la=en", "description": "St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said global trade and other risks remain high for a U.S. economy that may slow more sharply than expected.", "authors": ["Marc Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441026750&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0G2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
