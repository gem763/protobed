Official statistics are suspected of often being fudged to meet central government expectations.\n\nThe latest economic numbers appear to follow that pattern. China said its economy grew at a 6 percent rate in the third quarter, which happens to be exactly the government\u2019s baseline target for full-year gross domestic product growth.\n\nIf accurate, that would be the slowest pace of growth since 1992.\n\nGrowth would have slowed by more if not for a reported recovery in industrial production and retail sales in the final month of the quarter. The boost in these sectors coincided with U.S. tariffs and Chinese retaliatory tariffs rising in September, which some China-watchers regard with a high level of skepticism.\n\nNotice #China claims there was a growth spurt in September. How convenient to say there was a positive trend starting during the last month of the quarter. Growth was really 6.0% in Q3? Nah. https://t.co/aiqrIU2Yfz \u2014 Gordon G.

Investment in infrastructure rose, however, likely due to Communist Party official authorizing spending to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Communist Party in China.", "description": "While there is good reason to be skeptical of the official economic figures released by China, the economy does appear to be slowing.| Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/on-tour-Xi-Jinping-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
