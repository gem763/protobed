All of the feral pigs have tested positive for African swine fever, which is highly contagious and has no cure. It does not affect humans.\n\nThe latest outbreak of the disease was reported in China in August last year and has spread in the intervening months. Cases have been reported in Mongolia and Vietnam, with North Korean authorities confirming a single outbreak at a farm near its border with China in May.\n\nSouth Korean authorities offered to assist efforts in the North to contain and eradicate the virus, but were ignored. Pyongyang has made no announcements on further cases.", "description": "South Korea is deploying snipers to the Demilitarised Zone with orders to shoot any wild boar that are seen in the buffer zone with North Korea before they can bring more cases of African swine fever into the South.", "authors": ["Julian Ryall", "Stephen Bush", "Michael Hogan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000211701028-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
