Commuters vented their frustration at the alleged hypocrisy of the protesters for blocking electric mass transit, as well as their perceived disregard for the wellbeing of the public.\n\n\u201cWhat if someone needed to go to hospital or something,\u201d shouted one commuter.\n\nAlso on rt.com WATCH: Extinction Rebellion co-founder climbs UK govt building carrying hammer, as police ban XR protests from London\n\nPolice have confirmed at least four people have been arrested so far for their part in the protests.\n\nExtinction Rebellion launched the current wave of its divisive and polarizing form of protest on October 7. Since then, some 1,642 people have been arrested for their part in the planned civil disobedience.\n\nThe group invoked Rosa Parks on its Twitter feed, attempting to draw an equivalency between their climate protests and her fight for racial equality in the US.\n\nRosa Parks refused to move from the white section of the bus and our rebels refuse to bequeath a dying planet to future generations by failing to #ActNow. Our #InternationalRebellion against the complicity of our governments in the climate and ecological emergency continues. \u2014 Extinction Rebellion \u231b\ufe0f (@ExtinctionR) October 17, 2019\n\nLike this story?
