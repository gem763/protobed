And this time, it\u2019s stronger than ever.\n\nMembers of Till\u2019s family gathered Saturday at Graball Landing, the spot where the 14-year-old\u2019s brutalized body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River after his murder in 1955. Encircled by a vast cotton field and quintessential Mississippi flora, they watched as a new Till memorial was unveiled, this one 10 times heavier than the last, and made of bulletproof steel.\n\nA new, bulletproof memorial for Emmett Till was erected on the shore of the Tallahatchie River today, after vandals\u2019 repeated attempts to erase his memory here. pic.twitter.com/25hTobCfWl \u2014 Ja'han Jones (@_Jahan) October 19, 2019\n\nTill\u2019s lynching, which occurred after a white woman accused him of harassing her outside of a Mississippi grocery store, is largely seen as the catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n\u201cThis marker answers the question as to what we do with our history,\u201d said Reverend Willie Williams, co-director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, which advocated for the new marker. \u201cDo we learn from it? Do we use it to help our society have greater respect for humanity? This answers that.\u201d\n\nMembers of Till\u2019s family, including his cousins Rev. Wheeler Parker \u2014 the last living witness of Till\u2019s kidnapping \u2015 and Ollie Gordon and her daughter Airickca Gordon-Taylor, were in attendance to christen the new marker. Unlike previous markers placed near the location, the new metallic, commemorative sign will be behind a gate and placed under the watch of surveillance cameras, according to the memorial commission.\n\nIn July, a photo circulated online showed three Ole Miss students cheerfully posing with rifles beside a bullet-riddled Emmett Till memorial. That sign and others drawing attention to Till\u2019s killing have been frequent, literal targets for vandals wanting to obscure and destroy his legacy.\n\nJessie Jaynes-Diming, a civil rights tour guide and board member on the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, said the vandalism is an attempt by Mississippians to distance themselves from the state\u2019s wretched, racist history and alleviate themselves of guilt.\n\n\u201cTo desecrate the commemoration \u2015 not only of a Black person, but of a 14-year-old boy \u2015 is heartless,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s their way of saying, \u2018So what? I didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. Why are y\u2019all dredging this up?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 1955, a white shopkeeper, Carolyn Bryant, accused Till of catcalling her and grabbing her outside of Bryant\u2019s Grocery and Meat Market in Money, Mississippi. Days later, witnesses say Bryant\u2019s husband, Roy, and his half-brother J.W. Milam kidnapped Till from his uncle\u2019s home, then beat him, shot him in the head and threw his weighted body into the Tallahatchie River. A jury acquitted the two men that year after minutes of deliberation. Carolyn Bryant admitted decades later that her initial claims that Till harassed her were lies.\n\nAfter Till\u2019s swollen body was recovered from the river, his mother, Mamie, famously demanded an open-coffin wake at her son\u2019s funeral to publicly show the brutality of racism in the United States.", "description": "The civil rights martyr was memorialized on the shore of the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi, near where his body was discovered in 1955.", "authors": ["Associate Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dab4b5e2000001e175062e4.jpeg?cache=qml6qhszmh&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
