But on Tuesday, tensions reached a fever pitch when an anchor fed up with his rhetoric called him out on air.\n\nBrianna Keilar\u2019s scathing condemnation of her colleague came shortly after Duffy launched an attack on Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s top Ukraine expert who is testifying in the House impeachment probe. Vindman is expected to supply firsthand information on Trump\u2019s now-infamous July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump pressed Zelensky to offer assistance with an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, based on unfounded corruption allegations.\n\nCasting doubt over Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the U.S., Duffy told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that the official \u201chas an affinity, I think, for the Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe speaks Ukrainian. He came from the country. And he wants to make sure they\u2019re safe and free,\u201d he added.\n\nVindman immigrated to the U.S. from Ukraine during childhood.\n\nTaking aim at Duffy\u2019s remarks hours later, Keilar accused him of engaging in \u201canti-immigrant bigotry,\u201d reminding viewers of his reality show past, a stark contrast to Vindman\u2019s history as a decorated war veteran.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd questioning of patriotism coming from Sean Duffy, the guy who spent part of his 20s on MTV\u2019s \u2018The Real World\u2019 and \u2019Real World: Road Rules Challenge\u2019 while Alexander Vindman spent his on foreign deployments, including one to Iraq where he earned a purple heart after he was inured by a roadside bomb,\u201d Keilar said.\n\n.@brikeilarcnn on ex-Rep. Duffy\u2019s remarks on Alexander Vindman: It\u2019s \"anti-immigrant bigotry, and it's an odd questioning of patriotism coming from Sean Duffy, the guy who spent part of his 20s on MTV\u2019s 'The Real World'\u2026 while Alexander Vindman spent his on foreign deployments.\u201d pic.twitter.com/QofMhMKu58 \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) October 29, 2019\n\nContinuing, Keilar argued that Duffy\u2019s comments were \u201ca sign of how desperate the president\u2019s backers are as they try to defend him against what Vindman \u2015 perhaps the most credible and knowledgeable witness so far \u2015 has to tell Congress.\u201d\n\nSimilar attempts to question his credibility were been made by Fox News opinion host Laura Ingraham and her Monday night guest, former Justice Department official John Yoo, who suggested that Vindman had committed espionage.\n\nEchoing the skepticism, Trump described Vindman on Tuesday as a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d though he gave no evidence to support his claim.\n\nAccording to Vindman\u2019s prepared statement, he plans to tell lawmakers that he believed Trump\u2019s discussion with Zelensky \u201cwould likely be interpreted as a partisan play\u201d which would \u201cundermine U.S. national security,\u201d and that he felt responsible to report it.", "description": "Brianna Keilar called out the newly minted commentator for casting doubt on the credibility of impeachment probe witness Alexander Vindman.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db8a990200000823350726e.jpeg?cache=f9mr80dwxo&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
