Gala Dinner on the occasion of the World Mayors Summit, Copenhagen, Denmark \u2013 10 Oct 2019\n\nAlmost everyone gets nervous before public speaking, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is no exception. After going from a grassroots organizer to one of the most influential politicians in the world, she used her Instagram to give us a peek behind the curtain of how she prepares before giving large public speeches. She explained in detail how she fights nervousness through preparation, and then tries her best to roll with any criticism she may receive after.\n\nBefore taking the stage to give the keynote address at the C40 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen, a gathering of mayors all over the world dedicated to combating climate change, Ocasio-Cortez admitted that she felt nervous all day. Her nervousness was especially exacerbated after seeing how much press coverage she was getting before the event.\n\n\u201cI had been up until 4 writing a speech that I eventually scrapped and was starting all over. LOTS OF ANXIETY. I get very nervous before big speeches and moments,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd the fact that my face is on the front page of a Danish newspaper when I go to get coffee is not making me feel any more relaxed.\u201d\n\nHarnessing the nerves as fuel, Ocasio-Cortez worked on her speech up until the very last minute. She then explained that because of the way her mistakes are often taken on by the right, she feels held to a higher standard, but that ultimately is a good thing.\n\n\u201cIf one word or hair is out of place, the right seizes on it and makes the story instead of what we are here to talk about: creating economic opportunity for working people in tackling climate change,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the upside to being held to a higher standard is you get used to having to perform very well. So I\u2019m reviewing and reworking until the last second.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez wrapped up her \u201canatomy of a speech\u201d story by stating that it\u2019s hard to immediately gauge how larger audiences are responding to her, but she\u2019s working to be kinder to herself if she makes mistakes.", "description": "Mandatory Credit: Photo by Martin Sylvest/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock (10441030b) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, United States Representative, New York, arrives at a Gala Dinner on the occasion of the World Mayors Summit in Christiansborg in Copenhagen, Denmark, 10 October 2019.
