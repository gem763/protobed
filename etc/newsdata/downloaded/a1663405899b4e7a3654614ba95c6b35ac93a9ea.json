In Northern Lights, the first book of the trilogy, she is \u201clike a half-wild cat\u201d, with dirty fingernails, green eyes and grubby blond-ish hair. Keen, who is half British, half Spanish and lives in Madrid, is darker and is already the master of an intense glare, as anyone who saw her alongside Hugh Jackman in the Wolverine swansong Logan will know. When we meet, in a London hotel, she has the self-possessed cool of a total pro, even at 14. But there are plenty of Lyra-esque flourishes that make it obvious why she got the part.\n\nShe was almost 12 when she finished filming Logan. She had heard about the BBC/HBO adaptation of His Dark Materials, then in its early stages, and sent in an audition tape. But she didn\u2019t hear back. \u201cI thought, never mind, I\u2019ll just carry on with my life,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich is when I got stung by the jellyfish.\u201d\n\nThe production team had finally replied, asking her to make another tape. Keen was on holiday in Puerto Rico. \u201cI thought, right, I\u2019m going to have a chilled-out swim and then I\u2019m going to get ready. I suddenly felt this thing on my face and then it started stinging and then it expanded all over my face. I ran to my mum and I went, \u2018Mum! Is it really red?\u2019 My mum went, \u2018No it\u2019s fine.\u2019 And then she went, \u2018Oh no, it\u2019s not fine.\u2019\u201d Her face was red and swollen but she had to do the tape. \u201cSo my audition is with a jelly-face,\u201d she smiles.\n\nThe next step was to meet Ruth Wilson, who plays Mrs Coulter, one of the best evil characters in children\u2019s literature. \u201cI was sitting in the waiting room with 20 other girls,\u201d Keen remembers. \u201cI was thinking, oh god, they\u2019re all blond. I don\u2019t physically look like this character, and these girls all do. I went in, shook hands with Ruth, and five minutes later, she looked at me and said, \u2018You know, you have the same eyebrows as me.\u2019\u201d Fans of the books will know that this is a big thumbs up. Days later, she began rehearsals, with Wilson and puppets. In Pullman\u2019s books, people have daemons, an animal manifestation of their \u201cinner self\u201d, which lives alongside them. Because the daemons on screen are CGI, the actors shot their scenes with puppets to make their interactions as authentic as possible.\n\nWhen Philip Pullman writes, he isn\u2019t trying to bring down the church, he\u2019s bringing down the system\n\nNaturally, Keen is practised at describing what her own daemon would be, were this world to have daemons in it. \u201cMine is quite easy to figure out, because it\u2019s what everyone called me on set. Everyone calls me Monkey.\u201d In the books, daemons change form until their human reaches adulthood, when they settle as one fixed animal. Keen particularly liked hers as a pine marten.\n\nWe meet the morning after the world premiere of His Dark Materials, which was the first time Keen had watched it. \u201cEverybody had seen it apart from me! I\u2019m really busy filming season two, so I had no time to watch it. I had Philip Pullman right next to me, and I was like, oh god! But I think he liked it.\u201d Did he offer his approval? \u201cHis wife came up to me and was really lovely and was saying I was the perfect Lyra. I was really happy to hear that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dafne Keen as Lyra in His Dark Materials. Photograph: BBC/\u00a9 Bad Wolf/HBO\n\nKeen had not read the trilogy before she auditioned. \u201cNow I\u2019m a massive, massive fan. As soon as I read the books, I knew this was a good message to the world, and it\u2019s important that we have stories about young girls, because there aren\u2019t many,\u201d she says. At the premiere, Jack Thorne, who wrote the screenplay, likened Lyra to Greta Thunberg. Though she does not know it, the future of the world rests on Lyra\u2019s shoulders, and she has to fight tooth and nail to defeat the forces that wish to suppress free will and independent thought. Keen approves of the Thunberg comparison. \u201cI am genuinely in awe of that girl.\u201d\n\nThere have been various adaptations of His Dark Materials over the years: a Radio 4 series, a play at the National Theatre and the 2007 Hollywood attempt, The Golden Compass, with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. It was supposed to be a trilogy, but only the first was made \u2013 and Pullman\u2019s theme of an abusive authoritarian religious body was watered down almost beyond recognition. The television series seems more comfortable with its source material, and its Magisterium, the governing body of the Church, is portrayed as a fascist regime.\n\nIn 2007, the Catholic League called for a boycott of The Golden Compass, despite the religious references being excised, and the Vatican also denounced the film and Pullman\u2019s writing. Keen had seen it \u2013 was she aware that this new version might be controversial, given the backlash the movie attracted? \u201cI thought that was sad, but I understand why they had to do it,\u201d she reasons, diplomatically, of the decision to soften the book\u2019s themes. \u201cBut I think people are reading too much into it. When Philip writes about the Magisterium, he\u2019s not bringing down the church, he\u2019s bringing down the system.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mutant to mutineer \u2026 with Hugh Jackman in Logan Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox\n\nKeen was born and raised in Spain and is bilingual. Her mother Mar\u00eda is Spanish, and as well as being her acting coach is also an actor, as is Keen\u2019s father Will. He has a part in His Dark Materials, as Father MacPhail, part of the Magisterium faithful. \u201cHe is terrifying,\u201d says Keen. \u201cHe always plays bad people. I don\u2019t know why because he\u2019s so nice. I genuinely think it\u2019s because he\u2019s bald and has green eyes.\u201d She practically grew up in a theatre rehearsal room, because of her parents, but she thought she would be a biologist, like David Attenborough. \u201cThen I found out you have to study biology, and to do that you have to study maths, and I went, mmm no, I\u2019m not doing that. I hate maths so much, you can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d\n\nA friend of her mother\u2019s was making a short film, and needed a child for it, so Keen gave acting a go. She loved it. She did a series in Spain, The Refugees, alongside her father. (\u201cHe was playing my evil father, yes. Always got to give it the psychopathic twist.\u201d) She picked up an agent, who put her forward for Logan, and she got down to an audition with Jackman. \u201cIn the waiting room, once again, there was this perfect LA beautiful blond girl. I was just, like, a small, scrappy Latin girl. I always think it\u2019s not going to work out for me, and then it went really great.\u201d She auditioned with Jackman, then asked if she could try again, only this time she said she\u2019d like to improvise the scene. She was 11. \u201cMy heart was beating big time,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, I\u2019m just going to dive in and ask them, and they loved it, so I was lucky.\u201d\n\nJackman remembers the audition well. \u201c[Director] Jim Mangold looked at a lot of actresses for Laura. When he told me about Daf, I was hopeful, but when we tested together, I was blown away,\u201d he says over email. \u201cShe was every inch Laura. When Jim asked her if there was anything more she wanted to show us, she said, \u2018Can I improvise?\u2019 That\u2019s the actor that got the part and who you see on screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHugh is the nicest human being,\u201d she grins. \u201cI used to call him the human jukebox because he was always singing. Lin does the same thing.\u201d Lin is Lin-Manuel Miranda, who plays Lee Scoresby in His Dark Materials. He got Keen tickets to see his smash-hit musical, Hamilton. \u201cTwo VIP Lin-Manuel Miranda guest tickets. I felt like such a diva.\u201d On set, she would find herself singing the songs from it, but was too shy to sing when he was there. When Miranda had finished shooting, they all went for a meal to see him off. The bartender recognised him, and put My Shot on the stereo. \u201cMe and Lewin [Lloyd, who plays Roger] were like, we\u2019re not throwing away our shot, we\u2019re singing this song.\u201d They all joined in. \u201cI\u2019ve got videos of me and Lin singing it.\u201d\n\nRight now, Keen is preparing to go back to Wales to film season two, which loosely adapts The Subtle Knife, the second book in the trilogy. The third season, which will take on the astonishingly ambitious The Amber Spyglass, may take a little longer to pull together. Still, she is happy to live as Lyra for a while yet. She has taken plenty of her away from the experience already. \u201cShe taught me to speak up. Be bold, be brave, be yourself. Don\u2019t follow rules, because rules can be useful, but they can be very stupid and pointless,\u201d she says \u2013 sounding very much like her Lyra herself.", "description": "Facing down fascists in the BBC\u2019s Philip Pullman adaptation is child\u2019s play for an actor whose improv left Wolverine speechless.
