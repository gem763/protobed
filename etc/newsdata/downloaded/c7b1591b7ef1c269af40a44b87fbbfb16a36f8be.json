Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNed Yost, who led the Kansas City Royals to the 2015 World Series title and is the winningest manager in franchise history, will retire after Sunday\u2019s season finale.\n\nYost, 65, also guided the Royals to the 2014 World Series and posted a 22-9 postseason record. He owns a 744-836 record in 10 seasons with the rebuilding club, which has at least 100 losses in each of the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cWith the development of our young players and our returning veterans, I feel and hope the worst is behind us in this rebuilding phase of our organization,\u201d Yost said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMy plan all along was to get us through the rough times then turn it over to a new manager to bring us the rest of the way. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my time here as your manager and will never forget the good and the hard times we had together as an organization and a fan base.\n\n\u201cI will never forget the fact that you fans supported us through it all. Kansas City will always have a special place in my heart, and I look forward to rooting the Royals on to their next World Championship very soon.\u201d\n\nYost also managed the Milwaukee Brewers from 2003-2008, posting a 457-502 record. In 16 major league season, his overall record stands at 1,201-1,338.\n\nThe Royals finish the season with a five-game homestand, starting Tuesday with a two-game set against the Atlanta Braves. They finish with a three-game series against the Minnesota Twins.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Ned Yost, who led the Kansas City Royals to the 2015 World Series title and is the winningest manager in franchise history, will retire after Sunday's season finale.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433024846&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1MH-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
