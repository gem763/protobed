He was born in Texas to parents who were both migrant farm workers. He was a seasonal farm worker from an early age.\n\nAbusive labour laws\n\n\u201cAs a child I observed the abusive labour laws that were used against my mother and my three sisters. We had to fight with all our might to defend our families.\u201d\n\nIn 1978, Vel\u00e1squez, who founded FLOC, organised a mass strike of about 2 000 workers on tomato farms. Eight years later, FLOC managed to broker a deal between the workers, farmers and the Campbell Soup Company (a three-way contract), the major purchaser of the tomatoes.\n\nThe deal increased hourly wages and provided workers with much-needed health and safety benefits. He said that an academic study showed that if as little as a penny were to be added to each soup can or other products, it could double what farm workers earned. He said strike action was often not enough to leverage significant changes.\n\nVel\u00e1squez believes that the turning point in their campaign for better working conditions came when they went after Campbell\u2019s larger business partners.\n\n\u201cWe called for a boycott of Campbell Soup products and pushed the idea of three-way contracts. We then took on Campbell Soup\u2019s business partners like the Philadelphia National Bank,\u201d he said.\n\nEvery Friday at noon when most people cashed their cheques at the bank, FLOC members stood at the entrance with posters. They also asked people to make donations towards the campaign against Campbell.\n\nWhile this was marked as a victory for farm workers across the country, it was not the end of Vel\u00e1squez\u2019s activism. He went on to advocate for the rights of migrant workers and was repeatedly detained for civil disobedience.\n\nHe said undocumented immigrants should be encouraged to join local unions for better protection because farmers often threatened undocumented workers with deportation. The union would reply: \u201cAnd if you report them, we will report you because it\u2019s illegal to hire an illegal worker.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe raised the wages, improved the working conditions and stopped sexual harassment,\u201d he said.\n\n", "description": "Labour activist Baldemar Vel\u00e1squez shares his experiences at a farm worker conference.", "authors": ["Barbara Maregele", "Tariro Washinyira"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5133/36d3309a2e3249c5a722eac461fe94b3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
