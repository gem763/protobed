The date will become law once it is approved Wednesday by the unelected House of Lords, which doesn\u2019t have the power to overrule the elected Commons.\n\nThe looming national vote comes 2 1/2 years before Britain\u2019s next scheduled vote in 2022 and will be the country\u2019s first December election since 1923.\n\nWhile Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party has a wide lead in opinion polls, analysts say the election is unpredictable because Brexit cuts across traditional party loyalties.\n\nJohnson and Labour Party leader Corbyn will trade carefully crafted quips when they face off in the House of Commons\u2019 weekly Prime Minister\u2019s Questions session, the last before Parliament is suspended for the five-week election campaign.\n\nJohnson told Conservative lawmakers on Tuesday it would be a \u201ctough election.\u201d After three years of inconclusive political wrangling over Brexit, British voters are weary and the results of an election are hard to predict.\n\nJohnson will campaign as a leader with a plan to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d who has been held back by an obstructive Parliament.\n\nThe prime minister struck a divorce deal with the EU, which was approved in principle by lawmakers. But Johnson withdrew it after Parliament demanded more time to scrutinize it.\n\n\u201cWe need this general election to get a clear mandate from the people to deliver Brexit, the deal we have, which will get us out of the European Union,\u201d said Alister Jack, the government\u2019s Scottish Secretary.\n\nLabour will seek to project unity despite internal divisions between those who want to go through with Brexit and those who want to remain in the EU. The left-of-center party is calculating that voters want to talk about issues such as health care, education and social welfare \u2014 all of which saw years of funding cuts by Conservative governments \u2014 instead of more Brexit debates.\n\nMeanwhile, two smaller parties on opposite sides of the Brexit divide are hoping to make gains.\n\nThe strongly pro-EU Liberal Democrats have been eating away at Labour and Conservative support in Britain\u2019s big cities and university towns, where many voters opted in 2016 to remain in the EU.\n\nAnd the Brexit Party led by veteran euroskeptic Nigel Farage hopes to persuade \u201cleave\u201d voters to back a no-deal Brexit rather than Johnson\u2019s divorce agreement, under which the U.K. would keep some common rules and obligations with the bloc in order to keep trade flowing.\n\nMost economists say a no-deal Brexit would disrupt trade and plunge the U.K. economy into recession.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong chance that December\u2019s election could produce a Parliament as divided over Brexit as the current one. The clock is still ticking down to the new Brexit deadline of Jan. 31, the date approved by the EU this week when it agreed to postpone the U.K.\u2019s planned Oct. 31 departure.\n\n\u201cTo my British friends,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted Tuesday. \u201cThe EU27 has formally adopted the (Brexit) extension. It may be the last one. Please make the best use of this time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn were gearing up to trade barbs over Brexit and public spending", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/30/124586_britain-brexit-97463-flags-brexit-protestors-displayed-parliament-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
