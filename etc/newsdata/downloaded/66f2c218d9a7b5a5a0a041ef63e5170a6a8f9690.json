Its results were also boosted by strong demand for its SUV models.\n\nIt said its sales growth had outpaced the industry in Europe, China and the United States, as it sold 166,878 cars globally in the quarter.\n\n\"The growth in unit sales, revenue and profit was driven by a strong demand for our SUV range as well as cost efficiency,\" Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.\n\nVolvo - which said in July it would cut fixed costs by 2 billion crowns with measures to be completed by the first half of 2020 - aims to produce premium cars to rival BMW and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz.\n\nIt repeated on Thursday that market conditions would continue pressuring margins this year, but that volume growth and cost measures would boost profits in the second half compared with the same period last year.\n\nVolvo said it expected a slightly lower level of capital expenditure, after an intense period of investments in its global footprint and new technologies.\n\nFrench car maker Renault warned last week that its sales would fall this year and lowered its operating margin target, adding to signs of the sharp auto industry slowdown.\n\n($1 = 9.6385 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Helena Soderpalm; Editing by Susan Fenton)", "description": "Volvo Cars reported a sharp rise in third-quarter revenue and profits on Thursday helped by cost savings, but also sees market conditions continuing to pressure margins this year.
