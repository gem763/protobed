Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 presidential campaign comes word that the candidate\u2019s Iowa political director has departed as well.\n\nAccording to reports, a Sanders aide on Wednesday confirmed that Jess Mazour, who was named Sanders\u2019 Iowa director in March, was let go from the campaign in recent weeks.\n\nThe aide confirmed the departure on condition of anonymity because the aide wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss personnel matters, The Associated Press reported.\n\nSANDERS SHAKES UP CAMPAIGN LEADERSHIP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nPrior to joining the sanders campaign, Mazour was an organizer for the progressive group Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement. The Washington Post was first to report that she had left the campaign.\n\nOn Sunday, the Sanders campaign announced changes to its New Hampshire leadership after backers of the campaign expressed concern that the independent U.S. senator from neighboring Vermont could lose the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary early next year.\n\nThe campaign announced that Shannon Jackson, who ran Sanders\u2019 Senate reelection campaign in Vermont in 2018, would take over New Hampshire leadersip duties from Joe Caiazzo, who was transferred to Sanders\u2019 operation in Massachusetts, according to the Washington Times.\n\nThe Caiazzo-Jackson switch came one day after the Sanders campaign parted ways with senior New Hampshire adviser Kurt Ehrenberg.\n\nThe changes in the Sanders campaign coincide with the loss of a key endorsement for Sanders to rival 2020 progressive candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who this week attracted the backing of the Working Families Party -- a group that had supported Sanders in 2016.\n\n\u201cSeeing the campaign not be able to outshine Warren with WFP progressives doesn\u2019t have me questioning WFP\u2019s process,\u201d Rafael Shimunov, a 2016 Sanders volunteer and past national creative director for WFP told Politico. \u201cIt has me questioning where the Bernie campaign could have done better, because I want to make sure the strongest candidate unmasks Biden and unseats Trump.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA Fox News Poll released Wednesday shows that Warren has pulled virtually even with Sanders in second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden, with Sanders attracting support from 48 percent of respondents, Warren 46 percent, and Biden leading with 52 percent.\n\nFox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Just days after a shakeup in the New Hampshire leadership of Sen.
