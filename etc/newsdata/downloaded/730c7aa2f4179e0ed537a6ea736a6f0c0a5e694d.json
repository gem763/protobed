It said no final decision had yet been taken.\n\nShares in Commerzbank, which has been reviewing strategy in recent weeks, were 0.8% higher in late afternoon trade, with some investors saying the measures were not enough.\n\nKlaus Nieding, vice president of shareholder lobby group DSW, said the bank needed to do more than cut costs. \u201cThe big question remains how the bank wants to make money in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bank was ejected from the blue-chip DAX index last year, highlighting the challenge facing banks in Europe\u2019s biggest economy since the global financial crisis.\n\nThe bank said it would cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in \u201cstrategic areas\u201d, so the group headcount would fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce. It now employs about 40,700 people.\n\nThe sale of mBank would reduce its staff by a further 6,600.\n\nIt also aims to trim the number of branches by 200 to about 800.\n\nThe sale of its 69.3% stake in mBank has a market value of more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion). Commerzbank said the proceeds would enable \u201ca faster implementation of its strategy and the associated investments\u201d.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the Commerzbank are pictured before the bank's annual news conference in Frankfurt, Germany, February 8, 2018.

Comdirect shares jumped 26%.\n\nGermany\u2019s banks have been battling a legacy of bad debts, bloated headcounts and fines a decade after the global financial crash. Commerzbank has already been reducing staff and is trying to cut back-office work to restore profitability.\n\n($1 = 0.9081 euros)", "description": "Commerzbank said on Friday it wanted to shed thousands of staff and close a fifth of its branches in a strategy overhaul, after the German lender's attempt to merge with Deutsche Bank failed.", "authors": ["Tom Sims", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432013941&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1FK", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
