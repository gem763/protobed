He wastes little time in making an impression on several Chester residents, but it appears as if there\u2019s more to him than meets his eye as he has a sinister side \u2014 which is set to come to light.\n\nWith Tony still missing, Diane (Alex Fletcher) is forced to arrange Harry\u2019s (Parry Glasspool) funeral \u2014 and Marnie (Lysette Anthony) offers her support. Edward turns up on Diane\u2019s doorstep without any notice, and makes it clear that he hopes to reconnect with his family. However, Diane\u2019s not having any of it, and sense him packing as a result.\n\nEdward\u2019s not one for giving up, and thus he desperately tries to convince Diane that his intentions are genuine, and that he wants nothing more than an opportunity to build a relationship with his grandchildren. He makes several attempts to prove himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Diane\u2019s reluctance to let Edward in, actor Joe McGann said: \u2018All she knows of him is that he abandoned Tony. The reception is a little short of openly hostile. Then she sees that he\u2019s a man who has his charm, his sophistication, and he\u2019s worldly about most subjects. He throws a little party for Diane and her friends, trying to win her around. I think he becomes successful when Diane sees the way other people react to Edward and she mellows towards him.\u2019\n\nHowever, while Edward proves successful in winning round some of Chester\u2019s finest, Finn (Keith Rice) isn\u2019t convinced by his efforts \u2014 and it seems his instincts are correct, as he later spies on him, and follows him to the florist \u2014 where he spots him do something incredibly shocking.\n\nJoe said: \u2018Edward overhears Cindy talk about her problem at the florist where her business is being held up by a rare bird. Edward decides to take matters in to his own hands in a quite shocking way. Cindy\u2019s none the wiser but Finn catches him in the act. Finn is quite shocked by what he sees\u2026\u2019\n\nIt seems as if Edward is a lot more sinister than he appears on the surface.\n\nThe question is: what exactly is it that Finn catches him doing?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, will Finn relay his discovery to Diane?\n\nHollyoaks continues Friday 18th October at 7pm on E4.\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Every suspect revealed as Mercedes McQueen is shot and left to die\n\nMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Jake Quickenden\u2019s Woody charmed into dangerous action by Cindy Cunningham\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Edward is the perfect gentleman on the surface, but he's harbouring a sinister side \u2014 which comes to light when he commits a shocking action.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image001-6f2d_1571341202.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
