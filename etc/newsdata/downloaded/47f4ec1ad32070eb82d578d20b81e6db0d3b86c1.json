Three U.S. House committees issued a subpoena on Oct. 10 for Perry to turn over documents on any role he played in Trump's effort to get Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump's Ukraine policy is at the centre of an impeachment inquiry being conducted by the House. It stems from a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Trump had directed Perry to work on Ukraine policy with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nCritics have accused Giuliani, who was not a U.S. government official, of conducting a shadow Ukraine policy.\n\nIn a visit to Ukraine for Zelensky's inauguration in May, Perry had recommended that Zelensky talk about energy reforms with two Texas businessmen \u2014 Michael Bleyzer, a Ukrainian-American, and Robert Bensh, a frequent visitor to Ukraine \u2014 as well as unnamed Energy Department experts on energy reforms, a department official said earlier this month.\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney arrives to answer questions from reporters during a news briefing at the White House in Washington on Thursday. Mulvaney says President Donald Trump told Perry to work with his personal lawyer on Ukraine policy. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nThe Associated Press reported at the time that an unnamed source said Perry had pushed for Bleyzer to be put on the board of Naftogaz, the Ukrainian state oil and gas company, after meeting with Ukrainian officials during his visit.\n\nPerry had helped bring together a deal to sell U.S. coal to Ukraine and had worked with Ukraine and other countries to lessen European dependence on Russian gas by, in part, offering imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, a booming industry.\n\nPerry had been a rare Trump cabinet member, who was virtually free of ethics investigations that weighed on other Trump officials. He has been a cheerleader for U.S. oil, gas production and the nuclear industry, but failed to achieve a goal of subsidizing aging U.S. coal and reactors facing a rash of closures.", "description": "U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has told President Donald Trump he will step down, a source familiar with the matter said Thursday, a day before a deadline set by Democrats in the House of Representatives for Perry to turn over documents in the impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5325076.1571343946!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/u-s-energy-secretary-rick-perry.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
