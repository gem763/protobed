At the same time, TB is the leading cause of death in South Africa, with the World Health Organisation estimating that about 330 people in South Africa died of TB daily.\n\nMunya Matose, with the Division of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Cape Town, told Business Insider South Africa that they wanted to see \u201cwhether minibus taxis can provide sufficient ventilation in order to mitigate the potential spread of TB from undiagnosed and untreated passengers\u201d.\n\nThe authors put a sensor that logged carbon dioxide, humidity, and temperature in a commonly-used 16-seater Toyota Quantum Ses\u2019fikile model, and tested six window configurations with the taxi driving at different speeds: 40km/h, 80km/h, and 100km/h.\n\nThree configurations had two sets of windows open at a time \u2013 the front two, middle two, and back two. The other three had two pairs of windows open at a time: the front and middle, front and back, and middle and back. The authors compared the ventilation achieved by the different configurations with the World Health Organisation\u2019s guidelines for ventilation in general wards, new health-care facilities, and airborne disease precaution rooms.\n\nHands down the best configuration for air ventilation was to have the front and back pairs of windows open. This far exceeded the WHO\u2019s guidelines for an airborne disease precaution room. This was followed by having the front and back pair open (when driving at 40km/h, this met the recommendations for a new health-care facility, but not a precaution room). The worst windows to have open were just the middle or just the back windows.\n\nThe recent paper is based on Matose\u2019s masters research, which also looked at where it is best to sit. He used sensors to track airflow patterns. \u201cLong story short, the window seats or those directly behind windows got the best ventilation depending on the window configuration,\u201d he says.\n\nAwareness of how airborne diseases could travel in public transport is an important tool in fighting the TB epidemic, he says. The next step is to push for policies to reduce the risk of disease transmission in public transport.", "description": "The majority of South Africans use minibus taxis, and TB is one of the major diseases afflicting the country\u2019s population.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8872/84ce083d7f474f26ad80e3431643aed2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
