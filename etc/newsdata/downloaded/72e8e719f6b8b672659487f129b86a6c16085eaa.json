REUTERS/Kacper Pempel\n\nIn a speech just weeks after Bainimarama accused Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison of condescension and forcing Australian policies onto its Pacific island neighbors, the Fijian prime minister was more conciliatory in asking for support in fighting climate change.\n\n\u201cI understand the depth of feeling in coal-producing communities in Australia and the wider economic imperatives at state and federal level,\u201d Bainimarama said in Canberra, the Australian capital, after meeting Morrison.\n\n\u201cBut I also hope that we can eventually find more common ground in our \u2018vuvale\u2019 on the climate issue,\u201d he said, using the Fijian word for family, and the name of a partnership agreement that he said would guide the direction of bilateral ties.\n\n\u201cIt is the greatest threat to our security in the Pacific and for my own people and other Pacific Islanders, the impacts are really starting to bite.\u201d\n\nThe Pacific Islands Forum last month failed to agree on tough new climate change commitments at the insistence of the pro-coal Australian government, upsetting leaders of island nations at risk from rising sea levels.\n\nBainimarama said millions of Australians were already bearing the brunt of climate change.\n\n\u201cAnd as we have seen with the recent Australian bushfires, the ongoing drought and the fact that some Australian cities and towns face severe water shortages, the outlook is worsening,\u201d he said.\n\nMorrison is a staunch supporter of the coal industry and his backing of a coal mine planned for the state of Queensland was seen as a key factor in his government\u2019s surprise re-election in a May election.\n\nWelcoming Bainimarama earlier in the day, Morrison said the long-standing strategic and economic relations between their countries would endure.\n\n\u201cWhatever other complexities there are in the world today, one certainty is the relationship that exists between the people of Australia and the people of Fiji. And I think that will always endure,\u201d Morrison said.", "description": "Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama called on Monday on Australia to \"unite behind the science\" and be far more ambitious in reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430415024&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0ON", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
