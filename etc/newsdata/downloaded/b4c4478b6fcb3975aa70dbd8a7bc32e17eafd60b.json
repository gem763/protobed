I'm actually chasing something here\u2026 I actually want to find love,' he told the publication.\n\nHe went on to explain that Love Island certainly isn't a holiday, describing the idyllic Fijian villa as an 'emotional rollercoaster'.\n\n'It was not a holiday,' he said, adding: 'It is an emotional rollercoaster. One day you're up, one day you're down. You never get comfortable.'\n\n'They're not following any script, they're writing it as they go. No one can predict what's happening, everyone's on edge!'\n\n'Look, I'd never say never to anything, let's put it that way! I'm actually chasing something here\u2026 I actually want to find love,' Eoghan told the publication\n\nIt comes after Eoghan opted to leave the villa in order to save his friend Matthew Zukowski on Monday's episode.\n\nDuring his time on the show Eroghan found himself in a 'love square' with Matthew Zukowski, Jordan Cayless and Isabelle Green.\n\n'I'm 100 percent okay with Matty going after Jordan!' he confessed, before joking he'd even happily get in on the action.\n\nStepping down: Eoghan Murphy (right) valiantly opted to leave Love Island during Monday's episode so that Matthew Zukowski (left) could stay during an emotional episode\n\n'I'm thinking maybe all three of us all go for it... We'll make it work,' he added.\n\n'I've kissed Matty a couple of times already, so how hard can it be to take that next step? It won't be too much of an issue.'\n\nEoghan said he and Matt were both instantly attracted to Jordan, 28, and Isabelle, 27, following their arrival, but there was never any competition.\n\nAccepting: Despite finding himself in a 'love square' with Matthew, Jordan Cayless (left) and Isabelle Green, Eoghan said he'd also be open to his best friend dating his ex, Jordan\n\n'My initial physical attraction was more for Isabelle, and Matty's was for Jordan. So, we agreed that I would go after Isabelle for the time being, and Matty would go after Jordan,' he explained.\n\nBut the spark just wasn't there for the newly formed couples, and shortly afterwards, Eoghan ended up with Jordan, and Matt ended up with Isabelle.\n\n'Me and Matty were on the same page. Everyone was saying I stole his girl. That's not what happened at all! We knew what was going on,' he added.\n\n'Me and Matty were on the same page. Everyone was saying I stole his girl.
