The institute has 39 departments staffed by 6,000 personnel and will provide the new partnership with access to technology, equipment, and brainpower, according to Liu.\n\nJITRI is located in Jiangsu province, \"which is traditionally the manufacturing heart of China, but also has the highest concentration of energy companies,\" said Liu. \"The need for sustainable energy solutions crosses national borders, and I believe this new partnership will enable new solutions with global impact.\"\n\nThe University of Birmingham's Centre for Energy Storage will also play a major role in the partnership. And as several low-carbon power sources, including solar and wind power, which have a variable and intermittent output, innovations in energy storage will be key to phasing out fossil fuels.\n\nDavid Eastwood, vice-chancellor at the University of Birmingham, said the partnership with JITRI will lead to \"commercially viable solutions to the world's energy challenges\".\n\nThe University of Birmingham has already brought new technology to the market in China. Last year, its energy storage center worked with Chinese rail company CRRC Shijiazhuang on a prototype for a low-emissions freight container that stays cold without the need for fuel-generated refrigeration. In August, CRRC sold 49 of the containers to a manufacturer in China.", "description": "European and Chinese scientists have joined forces to combat climate change in a partnership that has committed an initial 2.1 million pounds ($2.7 million) in research funding for low-emissions innovations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/25/5db250dfa310cf3e97a2e742.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
