The Washington Times takes a weekly look at some of them that may have flown under the radar.\n\nSen. Cory A. Booker on Wednesday introduced legislation that would provide grants to localities for intervention programs intended to ease gun violence in areas with high homicide rates.\n\nThe grants would go to localities that experience 20 or more homicides per year and have a homicide rate of at least twice the national average or to communities that show a \u201cunique and compelling need\u201d for the grants.\n\n\u201cOften when we talk about gun violence, the discussion focuses on deadly mass shootings, but in my neighborhood in Newark and urban cities across the country people are experiencing this on a daily basis,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat said. \u201cThe epidemic of everyday gun violence that is ravaging our urban communities has been overlooked for too long, even as many neighborhoods have gun injury rates similar to war zones.\u201d\n\nThe grants could be used for hospital programs that provide counseling and case management to people recovering from gunshot wounds, outreach programs to reduce the risk of violence from \u201chigh-risk individuals, and other intervention strategies.\n\nMr. Booker announced the legislation with Rep. Steven Horsford, Nevada Democrat.\n\nMr. Booker has made gun control a key part of his presidential campaign. He has expressed support for a mandatory government buyback of certain kinds of semiautomatic rifles and announced a proposal that calls for licenses for all gun owners.\n\nWarren on money in politics\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday released a plan designed to curb the influence of money in politics that would expand public financing of elections and party conventions and ban federal candidates from taking money from corporate political action committees.\n\n\u201cHowever we choose to fund our campaigns, I think Democratic voters should have a right to know how the possible future leaders of our party are spending their time and who their campaign is rewarding,\u201d she said on her campaign website.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat, who has largely eschewed the high-dollar fundraisers her rivals rely on to raise money, would set up a public financing program for political candidates and parties that would give a 6-to-1 match for contributions of less than $200. It would be funded by penalties from \u201ccorporate malfeasance\u201d and \u201cmajor tax crimes.\u201d\n\nShe also would reduce the maximum amount someone can donate to a campaign from $2,800 to $1,000 and establish public financing for national conventions of major political parties.\n\nMs. Warren also would expand disclosure requirements for major donors and \u201cbundlers\u201d for presidential campaigns and expand regulations governing online political ads.\n\nShe would overhaul the Federal Election Commission, reducing the number of members from six to five and giving the FEC expanded powers to levy fines and conduct random audits.\n\nBiden on government reform\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Monday released a plan designed to cut down on conflicts of interest and corruption in government.\n\nUnder the plan, which puts President Trump squarely in the crosshairs, Mr. Biden would push for legislation to require presidential candidates to disclose at least 10 years\u2019 worth of tax returns \u2014 a nod to Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his own returns dating back to the 2016 campaign.\n\nHe also would block the White House from interfering with Justice Department prosecutorial decisions and would push to strengthen whistleblower laws so that a federal employee looking to expose malfeasance \u201creceives full protection against retaliation by anyone, including the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has railed against a whistleblower whose complaint saying he improperly pressured the Ukrainian president to dig up dirt on the Bidens helped push House Democrats to formalize their impeachment inquiry.\n\nAs he dealt with the fallout from his son\u2019s business ties in Ukraine, Mr. Biden also made a separate vow that if elected, no family members would be allowed to hold plum federal posts or have business relationships with foreign companies.\n\n\u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a Cabinet member, will, in fact, have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country. Period. Period. End of story,\u201d he said.\n\nParts of his plan mirrored Ms. Warren\u2019s effort to curb the influence of money in politics, and he would push for a constitutional amendment requiring complete public funding for federal candidates\u2019 campaigns.\n\nSanders on \u2018corporate greed\u2019\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders on Monday released a plan designed to end \u201ccorporate greed and corruption\u201d that includes higher taxes and a higher ownership stake for employees in their companies.\n\nMr. Sanders would require publicly traded companies and corporations making at least $100 million in annual revenue to provide at least 2% of stock to their workers each year until the company is at least 20% \u201cowned by employees.\u201d\n\nHe also would require 45% of the board of directors of such companies to be directly elected by company employees.\n\n\u201cFor more than 40 years, the largest and most profitable corporations in America have rigged the tax code and our economy to redistribute wealth and income to the richest and most powerful people in this country,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cThe American people are saying enough is enough.\u201d\n\nHe also would set new rules of the road for corporate mergers. Mr. Sanders would have the Federal Trade Commission look into all the mergers and acquisitions that have taken place since the president took office and undo the ones that have harmed employees or reduced competition.\n\nMr. Sanders also would return the corporate tax rate, which was reduced in the Republican tax overhaul, to 35% from 21%. His plan also would close some loopholes to raise an estimated $3 trillion over 10 years, $2 trillion of which would go toward funding a Green New Deal to combat climate change.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
