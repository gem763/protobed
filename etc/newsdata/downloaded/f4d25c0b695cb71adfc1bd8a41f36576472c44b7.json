Why won't they work with us to end this dispute?\"\n\nThe union said that BA never replied to a counteroffer it made to the airline on Wednesday.\n\nPilots are threatening to strike for one more day on September 27 -- and then possibly again closer to the winter holidays -- should the dispute rage on.\n\n- 'Deeply sorry' -\n\nBA says a \"vast majority\" of its travellers have either made alternative arrangements or accepted refunds since being informed of the possible walkout last month.\n\n\"We don't underestimate the inconvenience caused, for which we are deeply sorry,\" BA said in a statement to customers on Sunday.\n\nBut it remains unclear how many people using BA for just one leg of an extended journey will be affected worldwide.\n\nBA is preparing to cancel 850 flight on Monday.\n\nThe Financial Times said the airline normally operates 1,700 flights over a 48-hour span.\n\nIAG has been trying to rebound from a loss of investor confidence that drove its stock price down by almost 40 percent in the past 12 months.\n\nBut BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton said the company had adopted a \"cost-cutting culture (that) has in the eyes of pilots not only dumbed down a great brand but also made it harder for them to do their jobs\".", "description": "British Airways faced its first global strike by pilots on Monday and the possibility of almost all its flights being grounded for two days.
