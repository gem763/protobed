The rest was said to have been used for lunch, breaks, and time to review and change her statements given to prosecutors.Chung\u2019s second questioning ran for 15 hours from 9 a.m. to midnight last Saturday, but prosecutors were able to ask her questions for only two and a half hours, for she and her lawyer insisted on using most of the time adjusting the statements she already gave to prosecutors.Once prosecutors entirely finish their questioning of Chung, they\u2019re expected to decide whether to file for a pretrial detention warrant like they did for Cho\u2019s younger brother, who faces allegations of receiving hundreds of millions of won in bribes in exchange for offering jobs to teachers at a middle school operated by the Cho family.Cho\u2019s brother was supposed to appear at a court in Seoul on Tuesday morning to attend his warrant hearing and offer self-defense oral testimony, but he chose not to show up, citing physical pain after a recent surgery on his lower spine.The court was expected to decide whether to detain him late Tuesday night after reviewing documents on his case.Cho\u2019s brother had asked Seoul prosecutors on Monday to postpone the court hearing, but they refused. On Tuesday, a team from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors\u2019 Office traveled to a Busan hospital, where Cho\u2019s brother was staying, to check his condition, and determined he was stable enough to go to Seoul for the hearing.Cho\u2019s brother was escorted to Seoul, but apparently changed his mind about attending upon arrival.BY JEONG JIN-HO, LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
