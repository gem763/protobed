The fall was partly due to exceptionally high growth in the same month a year earlier as manufacturers rushed out models ahead of tough new emissions-testing rules. The latest figures led Volkswagen AG shares down 0.4% in early trading in Frankfurt and BMW AG 0.3% lower.\n\nThe ongoing issues in the car industry are hitting Germany in particular, but there are signs of weakness in manufacturing across Europe. Euro-area economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.1% this year from 1.9% in 2018, which would be its worst performance in six years.The weakness in industry hasn\u2019t had a dramatic impact on the labor market so far. If that changes, and unemployment starts to rise, that would mark a step up in the seriousness of the slowdown. It would also have a further damaging impact on car sales as consumers rein in big-ticket purchases.\n\nIn addition to the risk of a recession in Germany, carmakers are also facing a slowdown in the Chinese car market. European sales over the year to date are down 3.2% and the continent\u2019s five biggest markets all contracted in August, with Spain and France posting the biggest slowdowns.\n\nThe industry\u2019s predicament took center stage at the Frankfurt auto show, where thousands of protesters demanded political and industry action to combat climate change. The head of Germany\u2019s auto lobby group also unexpectedly announced his resignation last week.\n\nCarmakers at the show displayed their new electric models, which will become crucial in coming months as the companies race to meet new European carbon-dioxide emissions rules. Carlos Tavares, head of the ACEA and chief executive officer of Groupe PSA, last week called for more charging infrastructure to encourage consumers to buy the vehicles.\n\nNissan Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV saw the biggest slowdown in August sales at 47.5% and 26.5% respectively.\n\nEurope\u2019s July sales increase, one of only two monthly gains in 12 months, was almost entirely down to Central European countries, the association said. Only Germany showed positive growth that month among Western European countries.\n\nAfter the August 2018 boost, sales dropped dramatically overall and have failed to pick up since, with the association forecasting a 1% drop for the year.\n\n(Adds shares in second paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Oliver Sachgau in Munich at osachgau@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tara Patel at tpatel2@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- European car registrations fell sharply in August, deepening the woes of an industry battling sluggish demand in key markets and the challenge of rolling out electric vehicles.Sales dropped 8.4%, the steepest decline this year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association", "authors": ["Oliver Sachgau"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mGEY58jGVcTuL1OvEqvyRQ--~B/aD03NTQ7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/e520666ba962c9dc0a61c078d985659d", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
