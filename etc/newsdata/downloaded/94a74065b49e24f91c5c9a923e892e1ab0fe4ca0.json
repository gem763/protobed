To look at, there is little to distinguish the acrylic, mohair and Lycra blend knit from any other item of thrift-store comfort-wear. Aside from an iffy brown stain on the left pocket which, according to its current owner, smells of \u201cchocolate or vomit\u201d, it is perfectly unremarkable.\n\nDubious odours notwithstanding, the garment occupies an exalted place in popular music. It\u2019s up there with Elvis\u2019s rhinestone jumpsuit, Madonna\u2019s cone-bra and Elton John\u2019s duck outfit. Kurt Cobain wore it when he slouched on stage at Sony Music Studios in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, New York, twice in the same evening on 18 November 1993 and recast from the ground-up the concept of acoustic rock.\n\nThe first performance was for a run through of that night\u2019s hugely anticipated MTV Unplugged set. It was a stuttering rehearsal. Cobain told his drummer David Grohl \u2013 a little too sharply observers thought \u2013 he was singing out of tune. Cobain attempted \u201cAbout a Girl\u201d twice, complaining both times of feedback when he turned his head. \u201cPennyroyal Tea\u201d was abandoned at half way.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The accompanying 14-track MTV Unplugged in New York album was released 25 years ago this November. It stands tall as among rock\u2019s great live documents.\n\nTruly essential live albums capture a side of an artist that does not typically come through in their recorded work. Unplugged in New York achieves that and more. Not only did the hushed setting provide breathing space for the tender subtleties that lay behind the frontal assault of Cobain\u2019s music. It also saw him position himself not as furious headbanger but as lonely bluesman.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 10 best Nirvana songs Show all 10 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 10 best Nirvana songs 1/10 10. You Know You\u2019re Right (2002) That \u201cYou Know You\u2019re Right\u201d, recorded in January 1994 and not released until 2002, was Kurt Cobain\u2019s final song gives the track a morbid curiosity, and certainly it slips easily into the top end of their canon thanks to a tone of desolation that fits the narrative of a tortured superstar reaching the bottom of their downward spiral. In fact, the song is open to interpretation: a musical suicide note (\u201cI will crawl away for good\u201d) or a man making peace with his demons (\u201cIt\u2019s so warm and calm inside/I no longer have to hide\u201d). An enigma, to the end. 2/10 9. Come As You Are (1992) Nirvana\u2019s quiet/loud homage to the Pixies often verged on Weird Al pastiche, but Nevermind\u2019s second single \u201cCome As You Are\u201d is evidence that Kurt cribbed even further afield. The riff is such a close homage to Killing Joke\u2019s \u201cEighties\u201d there were rumours of a lawsuit, but Nirvana\u2019s wasted, nihilistic reworking helped it embed itself into the Nineties. 3/10 8. Drain You (1991) A Nevermind album track that became a fan favourite, the frantic and askew \u201cDrain You\u201d was written on the spot at Sound Studios, a minor masterpiece of impetuosity. Some have suggested it\u2019s a love song to Courtney Love, whom Kurt had met by this point and, judging by the chorus, they presumably bonded over a bizarre, ritualistic form of meat snogging. 4/10 7. In Bloom (1992) Just as Kurt always envisaged himself as a major creative force in rock music, he also predicted the jock invasion that would result. Hence the sardonic satire of \u201cIn Bloom\u201d, mocking the brainless mainstream rock fan who \u201clikes all our pretty songs\u2026 but he don\u2019t know what it means\u201d, even in a track designed to court them. \u201cIn Bloom\u201d was Nevermind\u2019s prettiest song \u2013 the jocks rightly flocked. 5/10 6. Sliver (1990) Concocted in a practice session between Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic and Mudhoney\u2019s Dan Peters, the febrile clash of grunge noise and indie-pop melody that is \u201cSliver\u201d is as Pixies as Nirvana ever got, and thus worked as a blueprint for their new Nevermind incarnation (as well as Green Day\u2019s entire career). Kurt decided to release it as a non-album warm-up single in 1990, a kind of ultra-pop warning shot for the more hardcore fans of debut album Bleach: \u201cI wanted to write the most ridiculous pop song I had ever written to prepare people for the next album.\u201d Job done. 6/10 5. About A Girl (1989) Even before \u201cSliver\u201d, Kurt had given fans glimpses of his inner pop fan, the kid that had liked The Beatles and ABBA just as much as Black Flag. He was worried about putting what he called \u201ca jangly REM type of pop song\u201d onto Bleach but actually presented one of Nirvana\u2019s most enduring tunes, a song about Kurt\u2019s fractured relationship with then-girlfriend Tracy Marander written after a night spent listening to Meet The Beatles on repeat. 7/10 4. All Apologies (1993) Intended as a gateway into the gnarled undergrowth of third album In Utero for the Nevermind fans that needed their hands held, \u201cAll Apologies\u201d actually acted as a reward. Survive the savagery and the final track unfolded like a comforting old-school treat of just the right flavour: melody and meat, wit (\u201ceveryone is gay\u201d) and weariness (\u201cmarried, buried\u201d) and a shrug of semi-atonement for putting more sensitive listeners through the grunge grinder for 40 minutes: \u201cwhat else could I write?\u201d 8/10 3. Heart-Shaped Box (1993) A song about children suffering with cancer, being trapped in an emotionally stifling relationship or Courtney Love\u2019s vagina, depending on who you believe, \u201cHeart-Shaped Box\u201d introduced In Utero with a brooding blast of surrealist rock therapy as vital as anything on Nevermind and, with all its imagery of internal organs, cancer-eating and umbilical nooses, a whole lot more visceral. 9/10 2. Lithium (1992) Hardcore Cobainistas consider \u201cLithium\u201d his definitive song \u2013 a quiet/loud ricochet of fragility and fury that takes in themes of schizophrenia, loneliness, self-hatred, lethargy and mildly scary sex. It actually concerns a man who turns to God when his girlfriend dies, but in splicing manic-depressive imagery with unstable, spasmodic dynamics, \u201cLithium\u201d is quintessential Nirvana. 10/10 1. Smells Like Teen Spirit (1991) You know those hipper-than-thou lists that try to make out it\u2019s shallow, ignorant and predictable to rate a band\u2019s culture-defining behemoth of a track as their best? This isn\u2019t that list. Even removed from its impact and overplay as grunge\u2019s \u201cParadise City\u201d, \u201c\u2026Teen Spirit\u201d remains an elemental force of rock nature, the sound of 15 years of pent-up basement punk anger bursting onto MTV with a riff like a battle cry. Not bad for a song named after a deodorant. 1/10 10. You Know You\u2019re Right (2002) That \u201cYou Know You\u2019re Right\u201d, recorded in January 1994 and not released until 2002, was Kurt Cobain\u2019s final song gives the track a morbid curiosity, and certainly it slips easily into the top end of their canon thanks to a tone of desolation that fits the narrative of a tortured superstar reaching the bottom of their downward spiral.

This isn\u2019t that list.

Not bad for a song named after a deodorant.\n\nThat the interior of the Sony studio \u2013 since demolished to make way for luxury apartments \u2013 was decorated \u201clike a funeral\u201d accentuated the haunting qualities. Cobain would die by suicide six months later. Unplugged in New York is a haunting glimpse of where his future may have lain.\n\nAfter his death, the cardigan was given to his family\u2019s nanny, Jackie Farry. She reluctantly sold it at auction in 2014 to pay for medical expenses following a cancer diagnosis. That collector has now decided to put it under the hammer. On the quarter century anniversary of the release of the Unplugged album, it has undeniably earned its place in music\u2019s sartorial hall of fame.\n\n\u201cKurt wanted something that would break away from just the normal, dull TV set,\u201d Nirvana\u2019s tour manager Alex MacLeod told Guitar World in 2008. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want it to look like just a bare stage. He had seen a lot of Unplugged shows before, and felt they weren\u2019t really unplugged.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d seen the other Unplugged shows and didn\u2019t like many of them,\u201d Grohl agreed, talking to Rolling Stone. \u201cMost bands would treat them like rock shows \u2013 play their hits like it was Madison Square Garden, except with acoustic guitars.\u201d\n\nMTV Unplugged was even at the time perceived as rather corporate and naff. For every knockout performance by Neil Young or 10,000 Maniacs, there was an artist taking advantage of the acoustic format to reduce their catalogue to saccharine and slush.\n\nExamples included REM\u2019s sappy 1991 session. Watched today it\u2019s impossible to get past Michael Stipe\u2019s oversized felt hat and the weird stool-shuffle he attempts halfway through \u201cPop Song 89\u201d. Sorrier still was the turn by Eric Clapton. Bleeding all the sexual energy out of \u201cLayla\u201d, he reduced his signature moment to a toothless rocking-chair amble (bagging a boatload of Grammys for his troubles).\n\nNirvana were the last band on the planet one might expect to cuddle up to MTV. It\u2019s no secret that in private Cobain was a good deal more ambitious than his nonconformist public persona suggested. He would ring up his record label and management demanding to know why his band\u2019s videos were not receiving heavier rotation. Nonetheless Nirvana were the face of anti-corporate rock. And they had a patchy history with MTV, having very nearly derailed the 1992 Music Video Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nNirvana had declined MTV\u2019s invitation to bash out mega-hit \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d. Instead they offered to perform \u201cRape Me\u201d. That was vetoed. Nirvana went ahead and played it anyway in rehearsal. During the broadcast proper, MTV producers in the control booth were prepped to cut to an ad break should Cobain and company repeat the stunt. It seemed they were about to Cobain strummed the opening to \u201cRape Me\u201d. But before MTV had a chance to kill the feed, he segued into the riff from \u201cLithium\u201d.\n\nThe performance ended with bassist Krist Novoselic nearly poleaxing himself throwing his instrument in the air. Next Grohl ran up to the mic and shouted \u201cHi, Axl! Where\u2019s Axl?\u201d This was in reference to a simmering feud between the titans of hair metal and their grunge usurpers. A fight had earlier threatened to break out backstage between Cobain and his wife Courtney Love on one side and Axl Rose and his security on the either.\n\nIn revenge, as the spotlight dimmed and the stricken Novoselic staggered away, Cobain descended into the stage pit where Rose\u2019s piano was prepped and waiting. He gobbed all over the keys. Later, perhaps as retaliation, Guns \u2018n\u2019 Roses bassist Duff McKagan tried to beat up his Nirvana opposite number, Novoselic. All told, it was a lively evening. MTV must have wondered if they wanted to bring it on themselves all over again.\n\nThe Unplugged format itself was an unlikely phenomenon. First broadcast in November 1989, the show had been loosely inspired by an acoustic set Bon Jovi had tacked on at the end of the 1988 world tour. Jim Burns and Robert Small, the Unplugged producers, wanted to transpose to MTV the earthy energy Bon Jovi had brought when he adjusted his mullet and whipped out his acoustic guitar.\n\nThey started modestly. The first broadcast featuring Squeeze\u2019s Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook and Cars guitarist Elliot Easton. The format soon caught on, though. By season two stars were clamouring to appear. Paul McCartney was one of the first to see the slot\u2019s potential. In the car back from his 1991 Unplugged taping he had his producer play the recording and decided there and then to release it as an album. Unplugged (The Official Bootleg) reached seven in the UK charts and gave Macca his biggest hit in America in over a decade.\n\nCobain never publicly explaining why he had agreed to do Unplugged. One reason may have been loyalty to MTV producer Amy Finnerty. Aged just 20 she had championed Nirvana when they were an unheralded indie band, pushing her reluctant bosses to play the \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d video.\n\nEgo may also have played in his willingness to participate in what was the very definition of a corporate rock dog-and-pony show. Cobain was known to be disgruntled at being regarded as a screamer rather than a songwriter.\n\nThe sense that he had somehow been slighted by the world was catalysed when, on the road touring Nevermind, he read a magazine article lauding his Seattle rival Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam as an outstanding lyricist and arranger. He put the publication down and squinted into the middle distance. Why wasn\u2019t anyone writing that about him?\n\nStill, Nirvana were only ever going to play by their own rules. MTV producers were thrilled when the band revealed their plans to feature guest performers. Eddie Vedder and Tori Amos were MTV\u2019s preferences. Nirvana wanted Meat Puppets, an obscure Phoenix, Arizona outfit Nirvana had fallen in love with during the making of their debut, Bleach.\n\nThere would be cover versions, too: of little-known Glaswegians The Vaselines and of David Bowie. The latter must have seemed especially alarming to MTV. Back then, Bowie was still regarded as a sort of super-naff crazy uncle to Phil Collins. It is hard to convey just how uncool he still was in the early Nineties. Cobain was taking a risk referencing the tall-haired family entertainer from Labyrinth. Later, it would be noted that of the six covers performed, five mentioned death.\n\nCobain was a bundle of jitters before the taping. In rehearsals, he shouted out to Amy Finnerty, asking that she and her friends sit up front during the performance proper. He was anxious and wanted to gaze out at some supportive faces. Nirvana\u2019s tilt at Bowie\u2019s \u201cThe Man Who Sold the World\u201d had stuttered ominously. And then there were the technical complications with \u201cPennyroyal Tea\u201d and \u201cAbout a Girl\u201d, which Cobain tried twice before abandoning.\n\nThe major worry for MTV producers meanwhile was that Cobain was skimping on the hits. As at the VMAs, Nirvana had ruled out reprising \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit\u201d. They were amenable to dusting down \u201cCome As You Are\u201d. But that was it as far as smashes went. Up in the sound booth, producer Scott Litt was taken aside by panicked MTV executives and asked if he could \u201cget more hit songs\u201d out of the band.\n\nSo there was real nervousness, on stage and off, as New York members of the Nirvana fan club filed in and took their front-row seats (so much for Kurt\u2019s hopes of seeing Finnerty and her friends). Yet nerves brought out something Cobain, whose performance is both steely and charmingly loose. \u201cThe Man Who Sold the World\u201d, for instance, would have not been half as moving had he not preceded it by stating \u201cI guarantee you I will screw this song up\u201d.\n\nHe meant it too, having done just that in rehearsal. Disorganisation similar raises its head going into \u201cPennyroyal Tea\u201d. \u201cAm I doing this by myself or what?\u201d Cobain asks. \u201cDo it yourself,\u201d Dave Grohl responds. They\u2019re making it up as they go. All these decades on seeing Kurt and the gang fly by the seat of their trousers still warms the cockles.\n\nEven more stunning was the closing performance of Lead Belly\u2019s arrangement of the old folk dirge \u201cWhere Did You Sleep Last Night?\u201d The song is about being adrift in an uncaring world. Cobain seems to burn out his vocal chords singing. As applause echoed around the tiny studio, the band went backstage where MTV producer Alex Coletti was waiting to beg for an encore.\n\n\u201cI had Dave, Chris and Pat ready to do it. But Kurt just wasn\u2019t into it. I was just doing my job for MTV at that point, trying to get that one extra song in the can, to see if the night could produce one more gem. The pleading went on for about five minutes. Finally Kurt said, \u2018I can\u2019t top that last song.\u2019 And when he said that, I backed off. \u2018Cause I knew he was right.\u201d", "description": "Rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2019s most famous scruffy cardigan is expected to fetch somewhere in the region of \u00a3200,000 when it goes up for auction shortly.
