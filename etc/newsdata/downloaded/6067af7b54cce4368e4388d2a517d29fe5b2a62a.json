It is a competitor of online car retailer WeBuyCars.\n\nMIH eCommerce is mainly an investment holding company and has investments in online classifieds marketplace OLX as well as Naspers subsidiary Car Trader, which operates as AutoTrader.\n\nNaspers announced in September last year that OLX would invest R1.4bn in WeBuyCars. MIH eCommerce wants to acquire 60% of WeBuyCars.\n\nThe Competition Commission assesses large mergers before referring them to the Tribunal for a final decision.\n\nAlthough the Commission found in May that the proposed transaction did not present any horizontal competitor overlap in South Africa, it nevertheless recommended to the Tribunal that the deal be prohibited.\n\nIn the Commission's view, the proposed deal could stop other businesses with similar activities from entering the market or markets, and the resultant \"merged entity\" would dominate any competitors.\n\nWeelee has already been called as a witness for the Commission in its case. It believes, however, that its status as a mere witness in the Commission's case would not have afforded it sufficient protection over its own interests.\n\nIt therefore opted to apply last week to be recognised as an \"intervenor\" in the merger proceedings.\n\nWeBuyCars and MIH Ecommerce opposed Weelee's application.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the Tribunal's order, its participation in the Commission's case opposing the merger will include the right to access the Commission's records and any additional documents filed by WeBuyCars and MIH eCommerce. This will, however, be subject to standard confidentiality arrangements.\n\nWeelee would also be allowed to lead the evidence of its CEO, but this will be limited to what is contained in his witness statement and to the extent that the evidence has not been led by the Commission.\n\nFurthermore, Weelee would be allowed to cross-examine witnesses called by WeBuyCars and MIH eCommerce, but only where this would not duplicate the Commission's cross-examination.\n\nWeelee must also stick to the Tribunal's existing timetable for the hearing, which is set to start on October 14.\n\nMIH eCommerce and WeBuyCars plan to oppose the Commission's prohibition recommendation.\n\n* Fin24 is part of Media24, a subsidiary of Naspers.", "description": "Weelee is allowed to \"intervene\" in a Competition Commission case relating to a proposed deal between WeBuyCars and Naspers-controlled MIH eCommerce.", "authors": ["Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7014/ae3544cbad7e40c0b3e863b4e89e0dc7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
