(AP) - Dalton Sneed threw five touchdown passes and Montana took advantage of two turnovers early in the second half to pull away for a 45-20 win over UC Davis in a battle of top 25 FCS teams on Saturday.\n\nThe Grizzlies scored on a 62-yard bomb from Sneed to Samuel Akem on the third play of the second half to take a 24-7 lead. Davis lost fumbles on its next two possessions and Sneed capitalized with touchdown passes to Jerry Louie-McGee. The first was a 14-yard pass one play after Ryder recovered a Jake Maier fumble. The second was a 23-yard play on the fourth play after Rice forced a fumble by receiver Darius Livingston that Josh Sandry recovered at midfield.\n\nSneed finished 22 of 33 for 268 yards and rushed for another 81 yards as the 18th-ranked Grizzlies (4-1, 1-0 Big Sky Conference) finished with 528 yards of total offense. Marcus Knight ran for 91 yards and scored the last touchdown for Montana.\n\nMaier was 32 of 43 for 275 yards and three touchdowns with an interception for the fifth-ranked Aggies (2-3, 0-1), who played Cal and top-ranked North Dakota State closer than they did the Griz. Last season, Davis outscored Montana 46-0 in the second half to win 49-21. Maier moved into second on the Aggie career touchdown pass list with 70.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Dalton Sneed threw five touchdown passes and Montana took advantage of two turnovers early in the second half to pull away for a 45-20 win over UC Davis in a battle of top 25 FCS teams on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
