Now that Turkey is in the middle of an invasion of Syria and trying to wipe out the Kurds, President Trump is saying that he\u2019s preparing to hit them with sanctions. Meanwhile, our troops are scrambling to safely get out of the affected areas and the Kurds have signed on to cooperate with Assad\u2019s Syrian army. But we\u2019re definitely going to start making steel more expensive\u2026 or something. (NY Post)\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said he would \u201csoon\u201d be issuing an executive order to impose sanctions on Turkey for invading Syria \u2014 which happened days after he announced the US was clearing the way by pulling its troops from northern Syria. The US, he said, would hike sanctions on Turkish steel and \u201cimmediately stop negotiations\u201d with Turkey over what he called a $100 billion trade deal. \u201cTurkey\u2019s military offensive is endangering civilians and threatens peace, security and stability in the region,\u201d he said in a statement he posted on Twitter.\n\nSorry to say, but this simply doesn\u2019t make any sense. The number of mixed signals coming from the White House on this issue must be leaving both our allies and our adversaries scratching their heads.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the assumption that the President\u2019s primary goal here is, as he says, to put a stop to the \u201cendless wars\u201d and get the United States out of Syria. Fair enough. He promised that on the campaign trail. But if that\u2019s the case, he clearly knew that Turkey was going to move in and try to clear the Kurds (and everyone else) out of the buffer zone across the Syrian border. In fact, he essentially gave them the green light to do so during his last call with Erdogan. (Whether he truly believed they would do it is another matter.)\n\nBut if we\u2019re just going to pull up stakes and \u201clet them fight\u201d (as he previously tweeted) then what is the justification for the sanctions? Trump\u2019s latest official statement explains this by claiming that \u201cTurkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.\u201d It goes on to accuse Erdogan of \u201cnot mitigating the humanitarian effects of its invasion.\u201d\n\nTurkey brought their military over the border and began bombing the Kurds. It\u2019s an invasion. As my dad used to say, bad things happen in war. This sounds like the President wants to impose sanctions on Turkey for doing precisely what Erdogan told him he was going to do. How do you invade a country and start fighting without precipitating a humanitarian crisis? People who are being invaded by a foreign army are pretty much facing a humanitarian crisis by definition.\n\nOn top of that, the Kurds are now suddenly allied with Assad and the Syrian army. For those with short memories, those are the folks who kicked off this disaster in the first place. (Okay\u2026 ISIS helped quite a bit, but Assad is a war criminal.) How the heck did that happen?\n\nI do my best to be supportive of the President when he sticks to conservative values and promotes sensible policies, which he does on a regular basis. That\u2019s particularly true on immigration, taxes, border security and other critical issues. But this situation in Syria just seems to be a huge blunder. The place was already a disaster in progress, but now it\u2019s really going to be going to hell in a handbasket.
