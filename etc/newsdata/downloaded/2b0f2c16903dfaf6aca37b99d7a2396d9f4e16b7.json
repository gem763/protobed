This is just like when House Democrats demanded that Mueller speak when he adamantly didn\u2019t want to testify. Except this time, instead of bringing in someone who was reluctant and had nothing to say that would benefit their cause, they brought in the bloviating embodiment of white, male mediocrity who\u2019s currently trying to curry favor with Trump for a Senate run in New Hampshire. If you were dumb enough to believe that this would be anything less than Lewandowski\u2019s shameless show for Trump, you deserve to be publicly humiliated by his completely unsurprising behavior.\n\nHouse Democrats are still relitigating 2016, and at this rate, they\u2019ll still be doing so in 2040. Even then, they still will not have learned not to invite Trump trolls to beat you at your own game.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tiana Lowe", "Washingtonexaminer.Com Opinion House-Democrats-Fully-Earned-And-Deserve-Corey-Lewandowskis-Trolling"], "top_image": ""}
