Even so, the candour with which he speaks in his first \u2013 and apparently only \u2013 autobiography, Me, is astounding.\n\nFrom the off, the \"Rocket Man\" star plunges into accounts of depression (there are multiple recollections of suicide attempts), drug addiction, break-ups and his prostate cancer diagnosis, but never appeals to the reader for sympathy. His voice, assisted by music critic Alexis Petredis (who worked on the book with John for three-and-a-half years) is warm and genial.\n\nThere are moments that are by turns hilarious, touching and surprising. The late David Bowie never seemed to like him, he says, taking on a forgiving tone as he observes how the Ziggy Stardust icon was \u201cabsolutely out of his mind on coke\u201d when he dismissed him as \u201cthe token queen of rock and roll\u201d. You feel a twang of schadenfreude as John recalls drunkenly throwing oranges at Bob Dylan because he was rubbish at charades. By the time you reach the moment he lost his virginity (although the actual moment is glossed over, suggesting even John has his moments of prudishness), aged 23 and already a bona fide star, you\u2019re practically cheering him on. And he certainly made up for lost time \u2013 as Petredis pointed out in a recent Guardian feature, \u201cyou\u2019ll never look at a snooker table in the same way again.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

His reflection on how, regardless of the success or adulation he was enjoying at the time, underneath the glittering costumes he was still Reg Dwight from Middlesex \u00ad\u2013 body-conscious, insecure, full of self-doubt and self-loathing \u2013 is deeply moving. In between the countless anecdotes with stars from across the decades, John\u2019s enthusiasm for music continues to shine through, even when he explains why he knew he was never cut out to be a classical pianist (\u201cMy fingers are too short for a piano player. If you see a photo of a concert pianist, they\u2019ve all got hands like tarantulas.\u201d), or muses that it was likely his parents \u2013 however unwillingly \u2013 who instilled in him a sense of rebellion that made him the groundbreaking artist he continues to be today.\n\nTowards the end of the book you sense John's craving for what he perceives as a \u201cnormal life\u201d \u2013 family dinners, doing the school run, staying at home with his family. It\u2019s wonderful to read about an artist who really has succeeded at both stardom and stability \u2013 who wasn\u2019t lost like so many others to the dark side of fame. \u201cThe great thing about rock and roll,\u201d John writes, \u201cis that someone like me can be a star.\u201d Really, though, Me is compelling evidence that Elton John was born to be one.", "description": "Elton John is not an artist known for being shy about his personal life.
