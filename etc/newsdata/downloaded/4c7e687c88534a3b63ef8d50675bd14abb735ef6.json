His main rivals quickly made the same promise.\n\nIn this election campaign, the parties have again come to hold remarkably similar positions on whether to tax Netflix and other web giants \u2014 only now, everyone embraces the idea.\n\nThe Liberals, the NDP and the Greens have nearly identical proposals in their platforms to tax multinational corporations that conduct their business online.\n\nEven the otherwise tax-adverse Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer supports taxing their revenues.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Joly, minister of Canadian heritage at the time, was widely criticized in Quebec when she announced the terms of the government's deal with Netflix. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)\n\nThis dramatic change of heart might be attributed in part to the public's reaction when the Liberal government kept its promise to not impose a Netflix tax.\n\nIn exchange for its tax-free status, Netflix promised to spend $500 million on Canadian productions over five years, including $25 million on French-language content.\n\nThe 2017 deal was deeply unpopular in Quebec. Many felt the feds gave in too easily to an American corporation without doing more to support the local film and television industry.\n\nBut around the world, national governments are also facing mounting public pressure to tax web giants.\n\nThis global backlash, say tax experts, is pushing countries like Canada to revisit tax rules that were drafted long before prime ministers could binge-watch shows on the internet.\n\nA sales tax on Netflix\n\nThere are roughly three distinct policy ideas that come up when the political conversation turns to a \"Netflix tax.\"\n\nLet's begin with the least controversial: forcing streaming sites like Netflix and Spotify to collect and remit federal sales tax, an idea backed by the Liberals, the NDP, the Greens and the Bloc.\n\nNetflix announced earlier this year that it has already spent $500 million on Canadian productions, two years into its five-year deal with the federal government. (Christophe Ena/Associated Press)\n\nTwo provinces \u2014 Saskatchewan and Quebec \u2014 already require foreign web companies to do this with their provincial sales tax. It's been a smashing success, revenue-wise, in Quebec.\n\nThe provincial government had expected to raise $28 million this year from the new tax. As of August 31, it had already raised $38 million.\n\n\"This part of the proposals is straightforward and fairly unsurprising at this stage. Many countries are exploring the prospect of digital sales taxes,\" said Michael Geist, who holds a Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa.\n\nThe challenge, he said, will be ensuring international companies comply with the rules. That could entail additional costs for the government which might outweigh the financial benefits of applying the tax in the first place.\n\nIn Quebec, digital companies have been willing to play along, signing up voluntarily to charge and remit sales tax.\n\nAfter all, it's consumers who are paying the tax, not the companies themselves.\n\nIncome tax on web giants\n\nMore controversial is the proposal to impose an income tax on web giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.\n\nThe idea is backed by every party. The Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc have even suggested a specific rate: three per cent of all revenues generated in Canada.\n\nWhile campaigning in Montreal Wednesday, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May says if elected, she promises to tax major tech giants that she sees as a threat to Canadian culture, such as Netflix and Facebook. 0:24\n\nSlapping an income tax on web giants was thought to be impossible just a few years ago, said Brigitte Alepin, a tax expert who advised the Quebec government as it drafted its Netflix tax.\n\nThe problem was double taxation. The corporations are headquartered in the United States and already pay corporate tax on their revenues there.\n\nMany feared that if countries went ahead and imposed their own income taxes without consulting each other, they would simply end up creating tax havens elsewhere.\n\nThere was also the very real possibility that the United States, angry at other countries eating into its tax revenues, would retaliate with tariffs.\n\nBut earlier this year, France went ahead with a three per cent tax on income international companies earn from providing digital services in the country.\n\nThe absence of retaliation from the U.S. suggests a similar move could be feasible for Canada.\n\nBut Alepin suggested that, before moving forward, the next government should discuss the issue with American trade officials.\n\nUnions representing film and television workers have been lobbying the federal parties since the summer. They want services like Netflix and Amazon Prime to contribute to the Canadian Media Fund, which invests in local programming.\n\n\"We have to be very careful with this approach. We have to be careful not to vex our neighbour to the south,\" she said.\n\nAlepin also said a three per cent tax should be seen as a short-term measure to address gaps in a tax system that wasn't designed with internet commerce in mind.\n\nAn international effort \u2014 headed by the OECD \u2014 is underway to harmonize the taxing of web giants. Canada should follow those rules when they're ready, Alepin said.\n\nWhat to do about Cancon\n\nThe third and most controversial issue related to a \"Netflix tax\" is what to do about Canadian content.\n\nUnions representing film and television workers have been lobbying federal parties since the summer to commit to forcing services like Netflix and Amazon Prime to contribute to the Canadian Media Fund, which invests in local programming.\n\nLiberal leader Justin Trudeau and Conservative leader Andrew Scheer take part in the the federal leaders French language debate in Gatineau, Que. on Thursday. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nIn Quebec, where a vibrant entertainment industry is considered vital to protecting the French language, there is still lingering anger over the Netflix deal.\n\nThe parties have been less specific about how they'd respond to these demands.\n\nWhen Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez released his party's cultural policies last month, he said \"we'll ensure that digital platforms play by the same rules and contribute Canadian content.\" He offered few details about what that meant.\n\nThe NDP platform makes the same commitment to making sure digital companies \"play by the same rules as Canadian broadcasters.\" The Greens are more explicit, saying Cancon rules will apply to Netflix.\n\nBut despite the anxieties within the culture industry about the Netflix deal, Geist said there are indications the Liberal approach has been successful.\n\n\"The reality is the company has spent more than $500 million on production in Canada just in the last two years alone. And they're doing that without the need for regulation,\" he said.\n\nGeist added that advocating for a level playing field could be a double-edged sword for Canadian content producers.\n\nWhile domestic cable and satellite providers, along with Canadian broadcasters, do have to help finance local productions, they enjoy other benefits that foreign streaming services do not.\n\nAccording to Geist, these include simultaneous substitution, must-carry requirements and copyright exceptions.\n\n\"If the [next] government does argue that what we need is a level playing field, then perhaps it also ought to recognize there are a whole range of advantages that the existing incumbents have.\"", "description": "Let's take a closer look at the three issues that sometimes get lumped together under the heading of a \"Netflix tax.\"", "authors": ["Jonathan Montpetit Is A Journalist With Cbc Montreal.
