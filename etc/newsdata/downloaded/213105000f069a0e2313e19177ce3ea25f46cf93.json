The Rams became the third straight team to drop at least 30 points on the Falcons; two weeks ago, the Texans scored a whopping 53.\n\nAD\n\nAtlanta\u2019s offense, featuring the Pro Bowl likes of quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones, mustered just 224 total net yards as the team was dominated in time of possession, 37:09 to 22:51. It didn\u2019t help that Ryan suffered an ankle injury in the fourth quarter that knocked him from the game, although backup Matt Schaub acquitted himself reasonably well with 65 yards and a touchdown on 6-of-6 passing.\n\nAD\n\nAnd as for the special teams \u2014 oy. Atlanta allowed Los Angeles\u2019s Johnny Hekker to complete a 23-yard pass on a fake punt, Falcons kicker Matt Bryant missed a field goal attempt when the game was still close and the Falcons lost a fumble that was returned by the Rams for a touchdown.\n\nFrustration got the better of Falcons running back Devonta Freeman, who was ejected Sunday after throwing a third-quarter punch at much larger Rams defensive end Aaron Donald. Given that another Falcons running back, Ito Smith, had already left the game with an injury, the team was forced to rely on third-stringer Brian Hill and special-teamer Kenjon Barner.\n\nAD\n\nAfterward, Blank was asked by the Athletic if he still supported Quinn.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019ve got games to play. I support the players. I support the coach. I feel all the pain that the fans feel, and also the players do and the coaches do, as well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn whether there was a chance Quinn gets fired Monday, the owner said, \u201cNo. But that doesn\u2019t change the record. It is what it is. It\u2019s just very disappointing for everybody.\u201d\n\nGoing back to last season, which ended with a 7-9 record for the Falcons, they have lost 11 of their past 15 games, and their one win this year was a 24-20 home squeaker over the Eagles that looks less impressive now that Philadelphia has fallen to 3-4. Still to go this season are two matchups each with the division-rival Saints (6-1) and Panthers (4-2), plus games against the 49ers (6-0) and Seahawks (5-2).\n\nAD\n\nQuinn, for his part, insisted Sunday that there would be no quit in his squad, saying, \u201cI never think you\u2019re out of the fight. You shouldn\u2019t think that way as a team member, and I certainly don\u2019t think that way as a coach. I recognize that when you don\u2019t play well, those are fair questions, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever out of the fight.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome observers, though, felt that the Falcons should throw in the towel on the Quinn era, which began in 2015 and crested in 2016 with an 11-5 season. Of course, that season ended with a blown lead of 28-3 in a crushing Super Bowl loss to the Patriots, and even with a 10-6 follow-up in 2017, it\u2019s been all downhill for Atlanta since then.\n\n\u201cThe Falcons\u2019 season is gone. Dan Quinn needs to go,\u201d declared a headline in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which told readers, \u201cThe NFL was ready to hand Blank the Lombardi Trophy, and now \u2014 two years, eight months and two weeks later \u2014 the high-profile owner has a pocketful of nothing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a while that the Falcons were poorly coached \u2014 Quinn confirmed as much when he fired three coordinators on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 but they now appear barely coached at all,\u201d the newspaper added.\n\nAD\n\nThe Falcoholic, a popular team website, asserted, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Falcons to fire Dan Quinn, if not past time.\u201d It said that Blank\u2019s \u201cdecision to stick with Quinn had a lot to do with Super Bowl-driven loyalty and this team\u2019s apparently strong talent base,\u201d but \u201cwith both of those disappointing in the extreme, there\u2019s nothing left to fall back on.\u201d\n\nEven the Athletic piece that relayed Blank\u2019s statements of support for Quinn stated in the headline that the coach had \u201cfailed,\u201d and that \u201chis firing from [the] Falcons appears inevitable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt hasn\u2019t happened yet, although Blank\u2019s comment that his unwillingness to fire Quinn on Monday \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the record\u201d could be viewed as somewhat ominous. In the meantime, Falcons players were left scratching their heads at yet another confounding result.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe definitely feel like we put a lot of time in each and every week and we definitely feel like we have the players to go out there and win,\u201d defensive end Vic Beasley said, \u201cbut it just ain\u2019t happening for us right now.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Already on the hot seat, Quinn presided over a lopsided home loss to the Rams that dropped Atlanta's record to 1-6 and had pundits calling for his head.", "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dRuKoSH_bKOR3CFRJGVxvC1OpPE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q43RGTXTRUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
