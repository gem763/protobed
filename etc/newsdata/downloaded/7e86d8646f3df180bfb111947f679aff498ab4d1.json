Several drug manufacturers have settled with the counties ahead of trial.\n\nThe attorneys say Polster\u2019s comments about his intentions to get plaintiffs help during hearings, media interviews and public forums are evidence of his bias and prejudice. They cited a remark made during the first court hearing in January 2018 for the multidistrict litigation when Polster said, \u201cMy objective is to do something meaningful to abate the crisis and to do it in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe motion said: \u201cUnder settled law, any one of these statements would be enough to cause a reasonable person to question a judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d\n\nA statement released Saturday by the executive committee for attorneys representing the government plaintiffs gave Polster their full-fledged support, calling him a judge with \u201cgreat integrity, intelligence, and impartiality\u201d who has served on the federal bench for decades.\n\nThe statement calls the defense attorneys\u2019 motion \u201ca desperate move on the eve of trial by opioid companies that created, fueled and sustained the crisis following rulings by the court concluding that there is sufficient evidence to find that these companies created a public nuisance and conspired together to avoid regulation and sanctions.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of one of the drugstore chains to Walgreens, instead of Walgreen.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Attorneys for eight drug distributors, pharmacies and retailers facing trial next month for their roles in the opioid crisis want to disqualify the federal judge overseeing their cases, saying he has shown bias in his effort to obtain a multibillion-dollar global settlement.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Gillispie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/opioid_crisis_lawsuits_12604_c0-286-4728-3042_s1770x1032.jpg?a25848b194acdb7dbe361f867d02e65eb7c07d69", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
