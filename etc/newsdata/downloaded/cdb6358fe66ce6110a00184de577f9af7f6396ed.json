But Mr Fletcher said he had no expectations of how much the next auction would raise.\n\n\"We always avoid making any predictions, first because we don't want to influence the process, but second, the Act is clear that the purpose is to allocate spectrum to its highest value use, not to maximise revenue for the Commonwealth.\"\n\nMr Fletcher said the spectrum band was \"pretty lightly used\", meaning repurposing it would not be complicated. The most significant user was the Western Australian Police Force, which has a body scanning operation in that spectrum.\n\nHe said the 18-month delay actually represented a \"pretty tight timeframe\". The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission needs time to assess how much spectrum each telco should be allowed to purchase. The ACCC's objective is to ensure competition is not compromised by allowing one player to get hold of too much spectrum.\n\nBefore the auction, Mr Fletcher said the government hoped to pass legislation that would extend the licensing period to 20 years. Licences currently last 15 years. He said this longer timeframe would give telcos more certainty.\n\nThe auction would be conducted with the aim of allowing \"rapid deployment of 5G technologies, the promotion of competitive market outcomes, and encouraging investment in infrastructure across both metropolitan and regional Australia\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaking this spectrum available means that the Australian telecommunications industry can do what it does best - provide world-class telecommunications services for consumers, small businesses and enterprises. 5G will deliver speeds significantly faster than 4G and at much lower latency,\" he said.\n\nThe so-called millimetre wave spectrum has a much shorter range than the lower frequency bands used by 4G, meaning mobile network operators must install antennas and equipment in many more sites to achieve the same coverage.\n\nUnlike the large sole-purpose towers used in macro-cell 4G networks, 5G makes use of \"small cell\" technology which can fit on smaller sites such as utility poles and the outside of buildings.\n\nWhile its range is lower and it cannot penetrate walls as easily, millimetre wave spectrum allows higher speeds and lower latency than the lower bands, and can support much more traffic.\n\nThat means, in addition to the Internet of Things and smart city technology it can support, it also opens new possibilities for 5G fixed wireless broadband, which could be used as a high-speed alternative to the NBN's fixed-line broadband.\n\nThe auction will come more than two years after the first 5G spectrum auction, which covered the 3.6GHz frequency.\n\nIn that auction Telstra emerged with the biggest chunk of spectrum, spending $387 million for 143 lots.\n\nMobile JV, a joint venture between Vodafone and TPG, secured 131 lots at a cost of $263 million, while Optus was the third-biggest bidder, spending $185 million on 47 lots.", "description": "The federal government has laid out plans to auction off a large chunk of the valuable millimetre band spectrum in a move to open the 5G floodgates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2688%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_240%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/62c1d057a2d10ea9c20a4afcd361e21d4402d8f4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
