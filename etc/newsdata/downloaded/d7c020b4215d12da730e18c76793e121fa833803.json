But it\u2019s also important to look at offshore investment as a way to tap into global growth opportunities and to grow your wealth in real terms,\" says Duvenage.\n\n\n\n\"It's no secret that our economy is caught in a low-growth trap. Investors should, therefore, be looking for exposure to other markets, where GDP growth is higher and where business and consumer confidence are more buoyant.\"\n\nPreserve your global spending power\n\n\n\nOne of the implications of living in an era of globalisation is that erosion of your wealth in hard currency terms can limit your options and affect your lifestyle, says Duvenage.\n\nFor example, you may wish to move to another country. It's also important to hedge against rand weakness if you are a frequent overseas traveller, or if your lifestyle includes the frequent use of imported products and services.\n\nHedge against local inflation\n\n\n\nInvesting in hard currencies can be an effective way to hedge against the effects of inflation on your savings and wealth, according to Duvenage.\n\nOptions for offshore investment\n\nInvesting in a feeder fund:\n\nA feeder fund is a unit trust that is priced in rand, based in South Africa and \"feeds\" into an offshore version of that fund.\n\nThese investments give you exposure to foreign investments \u2013 such as cash, bonds, property and equities or a combination of these instruments \u2013 in the denominated underlying currency.\n\n\n\nUsing your foreign investment allowance:\n\nTaxpayers over the age of 18 can invest directly offshore via two allowances \u2013 the Single Discretionary Allowance (up to R1m a year) and the Foreign Discretionary Allowance (up to R10m a year, accompanied by a tax clearance certificate).\n\n\n\nAn asset swap:\n\nCertain local financial institutions are granted permission to invest a percentage of their assets offshore. When they do not need their full allowance, they sometimes sell it on.\n\nThis is called an asset swap. While the money is physically offshore, it will have to be repatriated to South Africa upon redemption.\n\n\n\nInvesting in rand hedge shares or ETFs:\n\nOne way to get offshore exposure in addition to (or without using) your foreign investment allowances is to buy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or rand hedge shares on the JSE, according to Duvenage.\n\nRand hedge shares are those that earn much of their revenue offshore, while there many ETFs that \"track\" the performance of global indexes like the S&P 500.", "description": "The primary benefit of offshore investment is diversification, according to Andrew Duvenage, managing director at NFB Private Wealth Management.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8974/130e054758474d6c92b846eb938c976e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
