The iPhone 11 starts at $700, while the iPhone 11 Pro begins at $1,000.\n\nWith the Pixel 4, Google is making a statement about what it envisions as being critical to the future of the smartphone. The Pixel\u2019s 4 new motion sensors and deep integration with the Google Assistant suggest the company\u2019s approach is all about building more intelligence into its products.\n\nThe Pixel 4 \u2013 along with all of the other gadgets Google announced on Tuesday \u2013 is the latest result of the company\u2019s \u201cMade by Google\u201d initiative, which the firm launched in 2016 as its first major push into hardware.\n\nRead more: I\u2019ve tried every single iPhone Apple currently sells \u2013 here\u2019s how to decide which one is right for you\n\nGoogle trails behind rivals like Samsung and Apple in the smartphone industry. Its sliver of the market is so minimal that research firms like The International Data Corporation and Canalys don\u2019t even break out its shipments in their quarterly reports. But Google\u2019s hardware products do serve another important purpose: keeping consumers hooked into its ecosystem of increasingly important services and products like the Google Assistant.\n\nIf you\u2019re deciding between the Pixel 4 and Apple\u2019s latest iPhones, here\u2019s a look at how their specifications compare. We\u2019ll have a more comprehensive guide on how the Pixel 4 stacks up against Apple\u2019s latest smartphones once we\u2019ve had more time to use it.\n\nCamera\n\nsource Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBoth Apple and Google highlighted the camera performance on their new smartphones when unveiling them, and for good reason. Both phones offer high-quality cameras that are better at taking photos in various circumstances \u2013 especially the dark \u2013 than their predecessors.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at how the camera specifications compare between the two devices.\n\nThe Google Pixel 4 has two cameras: one telephoto lens and one standard lens. One lens has a 16 megapixel sensor, while the other has a 12.2-megapixel sensor.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 11 also has two cameras, each of which has a 12-megapixel sensor. But the second camera on the iPhone 11 is an ultra-wide-angle camera that offers a significantly wider field of view of 120 degrees.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro has a triple camera system that includes a standard, ultra-wide, and telephoto lens.\n\nGoogle, however, spent more time discussing the Pixel 4\u2019s software-based photography features rather than its hardware. The company showcased new computational photography features that will be available on the Pixel 4, such as a feature that shows HDR+ updates in real time rather than after taking the photo, controls for adjusting exposure in separate parts of the photo, and improved Night Sight performance than can capture images of a starry night sky.\n\nApple is also launching a feature called Deep Fusion for its newest iPhones, which processes photos at the pixel level to reduce noise and amplify detail. Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller described the feature as \u201ccomputational photography mad science\u201d during the company\u2019s iPhone unveil last month.\n\nRead more: Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 launch is proof that the smartphone industry is going through a massive change\n\nDisplay and size\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nBoth Apple and Google offer their new smartphones in difference screen sizes, but Apple offers slightly more variety.\n\nApple\u2019s new iPhones come in three different sizes: the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, the 6.1-inch iPhone 11, and the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max. Google\u2019s Pixel 4, by comparison, comes in two sizes: the 5.7-inch Pixel 4, and the 6.3-inch Pixel 4 XL.\n\nBoth of Google\u2019s phones, however, feature an OLED screen, while Apple\u2019s less expensive iPhone 11 comes with an LCD display. OLED screens are capable of displaying deeper, truer blacks and better contrast than LCD panels.\n\nApple\u2019s Pro-model iPhones claim to offer a higher contrast ratio than Google\u2019s however. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have a contrast ratio of two million to one, while the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL\u2019s is 100,000 to one. The iPhone 11 has the lowest contrast ratio of 1,400 to one.\n\nGoogle has made improvements elsewhere too: the new Pixel phones have a higher refresh rate of 90Hz, which should make scrolling and navigating the phone\u2019s user interface feel smoother and snappier.\n\nFacial recognition\n\nsource Google\n\nBoth Apple and Google allow you to unlock your phone just by looking at it, but with the Pixel 4, the search giant is claiming that it offers the fastest face unlock ever on a smartphone.\n\nThat\u2019s because it leverages Google\u2019s Soli technology, which the company says can start the process of unlocking your phone as you reach for it since it uses radar to sense its surroundings.\n\nBut Google\u2019s Motion Sense tech will be capable of doing more than just helping you unlock your phone faster. During the event, Google showcased how it will let you do things like lowering the volume of your alarm as you reach for your phone and skip a song just by waving your hand.\n\nApple also said it made improvements to Face ID with its newest iPhones that enable it to work up to 30% faster and perform better at various angles and distances. But it doesn\u2019t support touchless gestures like the new Pixel does.\n\nNeither phones include a fingerprint sensor.\n\nDesign and color options\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nApple and Google have also taken noticeably different approaches to design when it comes to their respective smartphones.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max have the familiar notch cutout near the top of the screen for housing the phone\u2019s facial-recognition sensors and front-facing camera. The Pixel 4, comparatively, has what resembles a more traditional phone bezel near the top of its screen, which is where its selfie camera and Motion Sense sensors are located. That marks a departure from the Pixel 3\u2019s design, which had a camera cutout that was deeper than it was wide in the top center of the display.\n\nApple offers more variety when it comes to color options as well. The iPhone 11 is available in purple, yellow, black, green, white, and red, while the Pro models come in midnight green, space gray, silver, and gold.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 4 is available in black, white, and orange.\n\nStorage and pricing\n\nsource JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to get a sense of which phone offers a better value without having spent more time using Google\u2019s new Pixel.\n\nBut here\u2019s a look at how the pricing and storage options compare:\n\nApple\n\niPhone 11: $700 for 64GB of storage, $750 for 128GB, and $850 for 256GB\n\niPhone 11 Pro: $1,000 for 64GB of storage, $1,150 for 256GB, and $1,350 for 512GB\n\niPhone 11 Pro Max: $1,100 for 64GB of storage, $1,250 for 256GB, and $1,450 for 512GB\n\nGoogle\n\nPixel 4: $800 for 64GB of storage, $900 for 128GB\n\nPixel 4 XL: $900 for 64GB, $1,000 for 128GB", "description": "Business Insider - Google just announced the Pixel 4, its new flagship smartphone.
