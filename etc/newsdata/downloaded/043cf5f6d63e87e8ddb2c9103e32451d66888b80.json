When we asked Norma who she thought would be best to take the baton from her, from four coaches, she unreservedly specified Dumisani and Dorette.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe as Netball South Africa then, based on Norma\u2019s recommendation, looked at their track records and the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d\n\nFor Badenhorst her appointment was a dream come true.\n\n\u201cThe dream of any coach is to reach the pinnacle of coaching the national team. It is really hard work. You really need to give a lot and for me it\u2019s not about me but about the players,\u201d she told City Press.\n\n\u201cIt is about the country. We should stand together as a team and country to make sure we reach greater heights. It was unexpected but I will give my everything to the team, the sport and the country.\u201d\n\nWe need to just build on what Norma has given us. I don\u2019t think we need to change a lot; I just think that it is important to build on what she left the team with\n\nAsked about her plans as the new coach, Badenhorst said the foundation had been laid to ensure the Netball Proteas only get better.\n\n\u201cWe need to just build on what Norma has given us. I don\u2019t think we need to change a lot; I just think that it is important to build on what she left the team with and keep on building forward. I think we need to give more players the opportunity to play at an international level,\u201d she said.\n\nNewly appointed assistant coach, Chauke (33) like Badenhorst, could not contain her elation at her new position.\n\nI am looking forward to the adventures and challenges and opportunities I am looking forward to growing, not just as a coach but as a person\n\nI feel honoured that Netball South Africa looked at me and saw it fit to appoint me as assistant coach of the Proteas,\u201d she said\n\n\u201cI am really excited. I am looking forward to the adventures and challenges and opportunities I am looking forward to growing, not just as a coach but as a person. I look forward to being part of and playing a role in the growth of the sport in our country.\u201d\n\nThe duo\u2019s first assignment will be the Africa Netball Cup taking place from October 18-22, where nine countries including Zambia, Zimbabwe and Lesotho will face off in Cape Town.", "description": "South Africa\u2019s new netball coaches are ready to fill Norma Plummer\u2019s big shoes.", "authors": ["Palesa Dlamini"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9420/baa262ab69b245c29ea8f61212d09431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
