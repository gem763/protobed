These include enabling Defence to focus on core operations while governing sustainment activities; engaging with partners that complement its capability gaps with frameworks and governance models; delivering partner-led solutions; delivering interoperable solutions that facilitate combined operations; offering adaptable and scalable services; and ensuring expertise is shared and maintained.\n\nDefence added the EOI forms part of a wider IT transformation program -- dubbed One Defence -- which is aimed at moving the agency from \"an infrastructure-centric approach to IT, to a more agile information-centric approach\".\n\nCentral to this strategy, according to Defence, is shifting the provision of multiple services including design and architecture, hardware and software, support arrangements, and delivery mechanisms, into a single network.\n\nEOIs are being accepted until November 18. Successful applicants will begin delivery from 10 August 2020.\n\nDefence confirmed in its annual report [PDF] released last week that it is part-way through its IT infrastructure transformation program. It added that the agency's chief information officer Stephen Pearson is addressing any disruptions the agency has experienced during the program.\n\n\"While individually these programs have delivered a significant upgrade to Defence's aging infrastructure and systems, the complexity and scale of this work with multiple programs being undertaken concurrently, has resulted in some recent unplanned service disruptions within the Defence Network,\" the report said.\n\n\"These disruptions have not undermined the performance of ADF operations. A comprehensive action plan under the direction of the CIO is underway to remediate these deficiencies.\"\n\nEarlier this week, insider sources from Defence told ABC that the agency had awarded Victorian-based consultancy firm Sinapse an IT contract, valued at AU$380,000, following a limited tender because a senior official had a close relationship with the company.\n\nIt was revealed during Estimates on Wednesday that the senior official involved was Pearson. Pearson confirmed the link to Sinapse was his son.\n\n\"My son does undertake part-time casual work in a technology area for Sinapse every now and again,\" he said, but denied his son received any benefit from the contract.\n\nWhile Defence said there were no complaints made about the \"perceived\" conflict of interest, Pearson admitted that on reflection he should have declared it before the contract was awarded, and not afterwards.\n\n\"I think because of my intent and commitment to do the right thing for Defence, I did not take it into account as I should have. The event passed and subsequently should have reported [the conflict of interest]. If I had my time again, yes indeed I would do that,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, Department of Defence confirmed during Senate Estimates that it spent AU$7 million to procure an automated travel management system as part of Project Concur that was ultimately abandoned, with the final cost exceeding a possible AU$10 million.\n\nThe travel management system was supposed to be completed by 2017.\n\nHowever, an audit by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) into Defence's administration of travel allowances paid to Australia's Public Service revealed that due to poor oversight from government, the project was forced to shut down in June.\n\nOn Wednesday during Estimates, Defence officials admitted it was due to \"poor administration\".\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nDefence to expand HMAS Harman data centre and increase power supply\n\n\n\nA request for tender document identified that a second data hall and a facility to house all engineering critical and backup services will be built.\n\nWhole-of-government software and services panel now open\n\nThe Digital Transformation Agency is on the hunt for providers of off-the-shelf software and services.\n\nGovernment IT procurement still favouring the big end of tech town\n\nThe Department of Human Services this week handed out AU$54.9 million to Dell EMC, IBM, and Oracle.\n\nNew hardware marketplace to allow SMEs to sell to Australian government\n\nA focus on the smaller players could give them a chance against the existing tech giant-dominated government service delivery model.\n\nSMBs awarded AU$37.5m in government contracts in 12 months\n\nThe federal government said it has awarded small to medium-sized businesses 75 percent of AU$50 million in technology contracts via its Digital Marketplace.", "description": "Defence wants to shift its IT capabilities so that it's less infrastructure-led and more agile.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/10/20/8effd1fc-5296-4633-b2e8-756bf8876758/thumbnail/770x578/3907f12d5034916afeac15d0b9ea0e16/australian-defence-force.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
