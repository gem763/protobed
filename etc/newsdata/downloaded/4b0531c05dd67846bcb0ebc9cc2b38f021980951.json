Their discoveries have forever changed our conceptions of the world,\" secretary-general of the academy, Goran Hansson, said.\n\n\"This year's laureates have contributed to answering fundamental questions about our existence,\" he said. \"The discoveries have forever changed our conceptions of the world.\"\n\nBREAKING NEWS:\n\nThe 2019 #NobelPrize in Physics has been awarded with one half to James Peebles \u201cfor theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology\u201d and the other half jointly to Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz \u201cfor the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star.\u201d pic.twitter.com/BwwMTwtRFv \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 8, 2019\n\nPeebles has been awarded the prize for creating a theoretical framework that is the foundation of our modern understanding of the universe's history, from the Big Bang to the present day.\n\n\"Were it not for the theoretical discoveries of James Peebles, the wonderful, high-precision measurements of the [Cosmic Background radiation] over the last 20 years would have told us almost nothing,\" Academy member Mats Larsson said.\n\nMayor and Queloz are recognized for the first discovery of a planet outside our solar system, an exoplanet, orbiting a solar-type star, in 1995.\n\n\"Einstein in 1917 put the first starting ideas in the direction of how we are going in cosmology.\"\n\n\"I was not working alone,\" Peebles said by telephone during a news conference in Stockholm. \"From the beginning, I have always had colleagues.\"\n\nReferring to the growing field of cosmology, Peebles reflected on his more than 50-year career and the changes that have occurred over that time: \"The subject grew and I grew with it.\"\n\nPast Physics Prize laureates include Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron. Marie Curie won the prize twice, in 1903 for her work in understanding the nature of radioactivity and again in 1911 for the discovery of the elements radium and polonium.\n\nIn 2013, Peter Higgs, who theorized the sub-atomic boson that bears his name, won the prize after the particle was observed for the first time during experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.\n\nCandidates eligible for the Physics Prize are nominated by qualified persons and invited by the Nobel Committee to submit names for consideration. No one can nominate himself or herself.\n\nThis year's Nobel Prize is worth 9-million kronor ($918,000).", "description": "The Royal Swedish Academy of Science made the announcement Tuesday in Stockholm that a Canadian-American and two Swiss scientists had won the prize.", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
