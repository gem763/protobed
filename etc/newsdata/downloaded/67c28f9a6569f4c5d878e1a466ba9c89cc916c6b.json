Dan Hunt, has successfully pushed forward for vote a bill, House No. 3719, aimed at banning use of the b-word (rhymes with ditch, hitch and \u2014 Happy Halloween to the kiddies \u2014 witch).\n\nWell now, at the risk of leading the city of the original freedom fighting tea partier down another path of censorship \u2014 holy sh\u2014. (Rhymes with twit.)\n\nAin\u2019t that a new twist on freedom of speech.\n\nThe ban, it should be noted, wouldn\u2019t affect those who use the word in loving context, as in a guy introducing his new pal gal to his group, \u201cHey, meet my new b\u2014.\u201d Nope; the ban only applies when the word\u2019s about to be slung to demean.\n\n\u201cA person who uses the word \u2018bitch\u2019 directed at another person to accost, annoy, degrade or demean the other person shall be considered a disorderly person, in violation of this section, and shall be subject to \u2026 penalties, \u201d the pertinent section of the proposed amendment to Section 53 of Chapter 272 of existing General Laws states.\n\nAnd all the rappers go \u2014 umm. So, too, Elton John. And the Rolling Stones.\n\nAnd all the free speech advocates.\n\n\u201cBeacon Hill Democrats like (Rep. Dan Hunt) are fearlessly taking on the biggest problems facing the commonwealth,\u201d the Massachusetts Republican Party mocked in a tweet.\n\nWho knew casual slinging of the b-word has been such a big deal in Bean Town?\n\nHunt, Inside Sources wrote, \u201cdeclined repeated requests to speak \u2026 on the record \u2014 an interesting decision for a government official proposing a government crackdown on speech.\u201d\n\nBut Hunt\u2019s office said the bill had been filed on behalf of a constituent.\n\nNo doubt, a woman.\n\nOr maybe, a female dog.\n\nNope \u2014 it was a woman.\n\nShe spoke here: \u201cTakiyah White of Dorchester who works in community service told InsideSources she asked Rep. Hunt to file the bill, and she absolutely believes using the \u2018b\u2019 word should be a violation of the law.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cI hear the word used every day,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m hurt by it. \u2026 At the very least, using that word is harassment.\u201d\n\nOh, whaw. Where were the legislative gate guards on this one?\n\nIt seems this might be a good teaching moment about ye olde First Amendment.\n\nIt seems, too, this might be a good teaching moment about the old adage, \u201cBe careful what you seek.\u201d\n\nIf White thinks the b-word is \u201churtful,\u201d needful of banning, just think what other words there are that could come as substitutes.\n\nAn example? Rhymes with duck.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
