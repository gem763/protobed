You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.'", "language": "en", "text": "Three days after the biggest climate strike in history, the United Nations hosted its first-ever Climate Action Summit.\n\nThe meeting, organized by UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was meant to rally member nations to enact stricter emissions standards to slow the effects of climate change.\n\nThe star of the show was the 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, who sailed to New York City for the event from Sweden on a zero-emissions sailboat.\n\nThunberg has emerged as the face of youth climate activism around the world over the past year. On Monday, Thunberg kicked off the UN summit with two of her youth colleagues, giving an impassioned and emotional speech to the UN General Assembly.\n\n\"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\" she said with tears in her eyes. \"Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\n\nFor four minutes, Thunberg held the room in thrall as she chastised leaders for talking about \"money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth\" while people suffer.\n\n\"People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing,\" Thunberg said.\n\nThunberg's youth movement\n\nThunberg launched the \"Fridays for Future\" movement \u2014 or School Strike for Climate (as it says in Swedish on her sign) \u2014 in 2018, encouraging students to skip school to demand action on climate change from their governments.\n\nIn November, when she was a ninth grader, Thunberg staged a strike for two weeks outside the Swedish parliament, demanding that the government cut emissions by 15% a year.\n\nNow she spends every Friday on strike. On September 20, she was joined in protest by an estimated 4 million people across 161 countries.\n\nThunberg will make her voice heard again on Saturday at the UN Youth Climate Summit in New York City, then speak at the UN Climate Action Summit on Monday.

The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.\"\n\n'Change is coming, whether you like it or not'\n\nThe UN secretary-general hopes to use the summit to encourage UN member countries to agree to stricter standards regulating greenhouse-gas emissions, using the Paris climate agreement as a benchmark. In December 2015, world leaders pledged that their countries would act to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with a 2-degree rise as the absolute maximum.\n\nAccording to Thunberg, achieving those goals has never been more difficult.\n\n\"For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight,\" she said.\n\nThunberg. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\n\nThe 16-year-old made it clear that she and young people around the world would continue to hold their governments accountable.\n\n\"We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now, is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not,\" she said.", "description": "The 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg kicked off the UN Climate Action Summit on September 23 with an impassioned speech.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d891f562e22af29e33f96d8-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
