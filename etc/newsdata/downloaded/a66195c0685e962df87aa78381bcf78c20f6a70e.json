The Syrian civil war was not caused by climate change.", "language": "en", "text": "Is global warming to blame for the Syrian war? Democratic presidential candidates Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke and Bernie Sanders seem to think so. At the CNN climate town hall this month, Buttigieg and O'Rourke referred to climate change as a national security threat that contributed to causing the Syrian civil war. \u201cWars that were precipitated by climate change, like Syria, will pale in comparison to the wars that we see in the future,\u201d O'Rourke warned. Both candidates follow the lead of Sanders, who has long claimed that \u201cclimate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism\u201d. Recently, he told his followers, \u201cClimate change is one of the greatest threats to global security. As we see more drought, as poor people are not able to grow the food they need, there will be migrations of millions of people all over the world.\u201d\n\nThis isn't policy discussion but deflection\n\nThis is an example of the messy game of \"Telephone\" that passes for climate policy discussion today. Scientists write a nuanced research paper. These findings become distorted in the interests of sharing a clear narrative with the public. Then a politician seizes on the news and twists the story even further.\n\nTo make the case for the link between terrorism and global warming, Sanders linked to a news story with a provocative headline: \u201cClimate change will increase risk of violent conflict, researchers warn\u201d.\n\nDear Democrats: If you want to slow climate change, carbon pricing is a necessity.\n\nBut that paper hardly offers compelling evidence that terrorism is bigger today thanks to global warming. The authors actually looked at 16 factors that drive conflict risk. When they ranked that list in terms of influence, climate came in 14th, behind more important factors like poor development, population pressure and corruption. As the researchers write, \u201cOther drivers, such as low socioeconomic development and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be substantially more influential, and the mechanisms of climate\u2013conflict linkages remain a key uncertainty.\u201d\n\nSyrian pro-government forces in Aleppo in 2016. More\n\nIn the case of Syria, the idea that we would blame the small and uncertain role that global warming has played in desertification to date is, frankly, bizarre, compared with Syria\u2019s history of bad water management, a population that tripled in 35 years and added pressure on resources, and the effects of decades of American and British foreign policy, the Arab Spring uprisings, religious and ethnic tensions, and political repression.\n\nA paper that studied the role of drought and climate change in the Syrian uprising found, \u201cAn exaggerated focus on climate change shifts the burden of responsibility for the devastation of Syria\u2019s natural resources away from the successive Syrian governments since the 1950s and allows the Assad regime to blame external factors for its own failures.\u201d It concluded: \u201cThe possible role of climate change in this chain of events is not only irrelevant; it is also an unhelpful distraction.\u201d\n\nA new 2019 study similarly says: \u201cThere is very little merit to the \u2018Syria climate conflict thesis.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDrought may not be as much of an existential threat as Sanders claims\n\nMoreover, Sanders repeats the oft-heard claim that we are seeing more drought. Yet, the United Nations climate panel concludes that there \u201cis low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought.\u201d\n\nIn fact, global hydrological drought area has been declining since 1900, and a recent Nature study reconfirmed this.\n\nA big logical mistake in blaming conflicts and terrorism on global warming is that it often pinpoints a specific place where climate conceivably could have made drought worse, but ignore all the other places where global warming similarly decreased drought.", "description": "This is a sad excuse for real discussion on climate change and international conflict, two very separate issues.", "authors": ["Bjorn Lomborg", "Opinion Contributor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ytAnRx2Z5Y5JQPXkpu._xw--~B/aD0xODk3O3c9Mjg2OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_opinion_532/7d71098c74d06eb6b7bc36cef1ecdca8", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
