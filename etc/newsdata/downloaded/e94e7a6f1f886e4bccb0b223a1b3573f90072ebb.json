The motor helps with slight adjustments to keep the aircraft stabilised.\n\nThis comes amid claims by SAA, which owns Mango, that it has been infiltrated by a criminal 'enterprise with transnational networks' which, according to a Sunday Times report, may have supplied dodgy parts to the airline as part of suspect tenders.\n\nThe SACAA, which regulates civil aviation safety and security, told Fin24 that a preliminary report into the incident on a Mango Boeing 737-800 travelling from OR Tambo International Airport to Cape Town International Airport on September 2nd has been finalised.\n\nNear Kimberley, the pilot reported a nosedive motion after the autopilot on the aircraft was disengaged.\n\nThis suggested to the crew that a significant 'out of trim' situation had developed. This means that the the plane cannot maintain straight flight without the pilot intervening. The crew stated that the aircraft was controllable, but the electrical horizontal stabilizer trim did not work, the report found.\n\n\"The SACAA investigation is on-going and we will be looking into the history of the horizontal stabilizer trim motor and other aspects which may have contributed to the failure of the motor, which may or may not have safety implications,\" the preliminary report said.\n\nInvestigations are still ongoing, as the preliminary report \u2013 which must be released within 30 days of an incident, according to regulation \u2013 does not serve to apportion blame for an incident when it occurs. The final report only have to be released within 12 months of the incident.\n\n\"We commend the flight crew, and air traffic controllers for prioritising safety and ensuring that the aircraft was eventually landed safely and without any casualties. That is their duty and what is expected of them. If there is any room for improvement, the final report will indicate so,\" SACAA spokesperson Kabelo Ledwaba told Fin24.\n\nLedwaba said only the final report would pronounce, with authority, the cause of a particular incident or accident, whilst outlining a list of safety recommendations to avoid any recurrence.\n\nLedwaba said the authority would never allow any unsafe aircraft to take to the skies, nor would it allow any licence holder to touch any aircraft if evidence indicated that there was non-compliance with the aircraft which could jeopardise safety.\n\n\"Neither will we take hasty and indiscreet decisions on on-going investigations of incidences that have not yet been thoroughly interrogated,\" Ledwaba said.", "description": "This comes amid claims by the SAA that it has been infiltrated by a criminal \"enterprise with transnational networks\", and reports that it may have received dodgy parts.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3985/79313088f08849fc8c0594a40de6c496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
