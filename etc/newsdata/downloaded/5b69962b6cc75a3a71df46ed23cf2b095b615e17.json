The global ratio has risen sharply in recent decades, from 1,900 to 1 in 1980 to about 3,200 to 1 today.\n\nSome remote parishes go months without a visit from a priest.\n\nContext: In June, Pope Francis asked the Church to consider ordaining married elders who are respected by their communities to serve as priests in remote parts of South America.\n\nA 3-week Vatican meeting of bishops will consider environmental and religious issues in the Amazon region in general, but priestly celibacy is one of the more contentious items up for debate.\n\nWhat they're saying: In his homily on Sunday, the pope did not reference the celibacy debate directly, but asked the church to consider innovation: \"If everything continues as it was, if we spend our days content that \u2018this is the way things have always been done,\u2019 then the gift vanishes, smothered by the ashes of fear and concern for defending the status quo.\"\n\nAmerican Cardinal Raymond Burke and Bishop Athanasius Schneider of Kazakhstan asked Catholics to hold prayer vigils and fast for 40 days throughout the meeting in protest of the debate.\n\nGo deeper: Pope Francis meets with Jesuit criticized for LGBTQ outreach", "description": "Bishops could change the celibacy requirement to help remote parishes in South America.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/zjSE0_brG10z3TXjDT_Zhx5dkv8=/0x313:3000x2000/1920x1080/2019/10/06/1570378236299.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
