If foreign governments think they can tilt the playing field as they did against me, which was a deliberate, well planned out effort laid out in an indictments against Russian military actors and their allies\u2013 Well, you know, Republicans seem to think that, \u2018Ok, so far Russia\u2019s playing on the red team. You know. So we like it. We\u2019re not going to stand up against it.\u2019 Well, who\u2019s to say that next week they\u2019re going to be playing on the blue team? It\u2019s crazy my friends.\n\nHowever, Clinton failed to mention the well-documented Ukrainian efforts to sink Trump and boost her campaign.\n\nThe former secretary of state continued, calling the partisan-fueled impeachment inquiry the \u201cappropriate remedy\u201d to the \u201cserious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo impeachment is the appropriate remedy, and it is such a serious assault on our democracy that is apparently asked for, aided and abetted by not only the president but his allies who seem not to either care or understand how deeply dangerous this is,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cI am all in favor of what the House is doing and gathering the evidence and making the case because this president has to be held to account because of his unconstitutional abuse of power, his contempt of Congress, and his obstruction of justice,\u201d she added.\n\nPresident Trump suggested on Tuesday that \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d should join the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d on the condition of explaining \u201call of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d\n\nClinton replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job,\u201d fueling speculation that she is considering another presidential run.\n\nI think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u201cC\u201d Subpoena! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nClinton recently floated the possibility of a rematch on PBS NewsHour:\n\nYou know, it truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me. But this latest tweet is so typical of him. Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. So, he\u2019s either lying or delusional, or both. There was no subpoena, as he says in a tweet this morning. So, maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\n\nClinton is expected to host \u201cDinner and a Conversation\u201d in her Washington, DC, home this month in partnership with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Women\u2019s Leadership Forum, adding to the speculation of another presidential bid on the horizon.", "description": "Hillary Clinton says pursuing impeachment is the \"only appropriate remedy\" to address President Trump's \"unconstitutional abuse of power.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1178858012-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
