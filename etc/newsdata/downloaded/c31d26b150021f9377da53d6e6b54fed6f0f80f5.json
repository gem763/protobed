So much so, that she features in the latest episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians that sees Sofia and Scott join Kourtney and the kids in Finland.\n\nKourtney had suggested Scott bring Sofia along, but he admitted that the model often feels \u2018left out\u2019 when she\u2019s around the exes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018I never want to miss out on anything when it includes the kids. The past six to eight months, we\u2019ve been on a couple of trips where it\u2019s been Kourtney, Sofia, the kids\u2026 and it\u2019s been great.\n\n\u2018But, Sofia mentioned to me that she feels a little left out, so I have to be careful not to overstep anyone\u2019s boundaries and make anyone feel left out.\u2019\n\nConscious of how Sofia feels, he added: \u2018I don\u2019t want her to feel out of place, I don\u2019t want her to feel like she\u2019s not as comfortable as I am.\u2019\n\nScott said he wanted to be \u2018cautious of everyone\u2019s feelings\u2019 but admitted it can be hard being around both Sofia and Kourtney at the same time \u2013 given his history with Kourt.\n\n\u2018Sometimes you have so many inside jokes or inside things with somebody you\u2019ve known for so long, even if you\u2019re not romantically with them, you don\u2019t really know how to act,\u2019 he said.\n\nScott and Sofia have been dating for the last two years (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018It is definitely a really hard and awkward situation, and I just feel bad. At the end of the day, I want the people I love in my life to be happy.\u2019\n\nWhile the trip turned out to be an all-round success, there were a few awkward moments that led to Kourtney grilling Scott on their unconventional setup.\n\nShe was annoyed that he\u2019d left with Sofia early during a trip to Santa\u2019s workshop and told the Flip It Like Disick star he\u2019s putting \u2018too much pressure\u2019 on himself to please everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe episode will give fans an inside look at Scott\u2019s relationship with Sofia, as the couple usually tend to keep their romance pretty private.\n\nSpeaking about Scott earlier this year, Sofia told Tatler magazine: \u2018I think a lot of people think they have to prove their relationships through social media and I\u2019m just happy being private about my relationship.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not like I won\u2019t post pictures about it, but I like having my little private life.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
