It shows that the Democrats are willing to \u201cabandon their interest in protecting guest workers in order to get an amnesty,\u201d she added.\n\nThe bipartisan voters-for-cheap-labor swap may be announced very soon and then put on a fast track to the Senate.\n\nShahoulian provided few details of the deal except that it would cover one million farmworkers.\n\nSeveral farmworker proposals in 2017 and 2018 allowed many illegal aliens to transition into legal guest workers before getting green cards and citizenship.\n\nThe bipartisan plans also assumed that farmworkers would quickly migrate away from the farms to urban jobs where they would help reduce wages for Americans in urban jobs. So the deals allowed farm companies to import at least one million replacement farmworkers via the existing H-2A or projected H-2C visa programs.\n\nThose deals allowed the migrant workers to take jobs in the broadly defined food sector, perhaps allowing them to replace blue-collar Americans in meatpacking plants, food-processing facilities, and even food-distribution tasks. However, those deals failed because the GOP\u2019s voter base is increasingly aware of the economic impact of cheap labor migration.\n\nRepublican Senator and House members from agricultural states are backing the \u201clegalization\u201d deal, Shahoulian said:\n\nThere are some important Republican senators who are in discussions with us and the Republicans that we\u2019re speaking to and who are rooting for us, who know what our package looks like and would like to see it come out of the House, and they think they can take it over there. Now, you know, will [Majority Leader Sen. Mitch] McConnell let it go to the floor? Will will this president and Steven Miller see it, and, you know \u2014 excuse my language \u2014 crap all over it and kill it? Yeah, I mean, that\u2019s very possible, but you gotta try.\n\nThe cooperative GOP legislators likely include Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford and U.S. representatives from dairy districts, Vaughan said.\n\nThe deal is likely also backed by pro-business factions in Trump\u2019s White House, said Vaughan. Sonny Perdue, the Secretary of Agriculture, and Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, have a long history of supporting cheap labor programs for agricultural companies, she said.\n\nMany farm companies dislike the H-2A program, which allows employers to import temporary workers for up to $15.00 per hour of work. There is no cap on the program, which grew slowly from 16,000 in 1997 to up to 90,000 in 2014.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s combination of a growing economy and \u201cHire American\u201d policies are nudging up wages \u2014 even for illegal aliens. In response, farm companies rushed to hire 243,000 H-2A workers in 2018.\n\nTrump\u2019s wage increases are also pressuring farm companies to develop and order American-made, labor-saving machinery, including strawberry picking and cow milking robots. However, the federal government does little to promote the use of labor-saving robots.\n\nBen & Jerry's corp. panders to its progressive buyers by supposedly boosting the 'dignity' of illegal migrant dairy workers. But the policy lowers corporate costs & delays spending on labor-saving dairy robots. What flavor tastes like progressive vanity? https://t.co/nsOoGrPqZN \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 17, 2019\n\nRepublicans who back the amnesty will cripple Trump, their GOP colleagues, and their voters, Vaughan warned:\n\nThis is the folly of Republicans who live in agriculture areas who think that it is a good idea or a smart strategy to serve agriculture interests. Ultimately they are going to put themselves and their party out of a job because of the demographic effects and likely political effects down the line \u2026 In the long term, it is a disaster for their party, their own ability to stay in power, and for their constituents.\n\nTrump should override the business faction in the GOP to block the Democrats\u2019 push for a farmworker amnesty, she said.\n\nHe should not be signing off on any guest worker or legal immigration deals before the border and enforcement problems are under better control. It does not matter what the rules are for any new deal if the rules are not getting enforced anyway. [Also] he\u2019s giving away his best bargaining chips and leaving himself without any leverage to get the needed enforcement [in a 2021 deal]. Why would he make a [2019] deal like this before he has his budget for DHS? Before he has what he needs for funding interior enforcement?\u201d\n\nThe agriculture bill is just one of several migration bills being pushed quietly by Democrats.\n\nIn June, Democrats passed their \u201cDREAM\u201d act bill to amnesty the population of approximately three million youths and adults who were brought into the country by their migrant parents.\n\nDemocrats are using the same cheap-labor-for-voters strategy to pass a law offering fast track green cards to Indian college graduates who use H-1B visas to take jobs from American graduates. The House\u2019s green card giveaway bill, guided by Shahoulian, passed the House with 140 GOP votes in July amid silence from the media establishment.\n\nGOP Sen. Mike Lee is trying to push a matching bill through the Senate amid silence from GOP Senators and conditional opposition from Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin.\n\nSince 1990, the promise of green cards in exchange for college graduate labor has helped bring roughly four million Indians into the United States. The Indian immigrants have a high income, naturally align with the pro-diversity Democrat Party, and are now becoming a political factor, especially in Texas. For example, Texas\u2019s 22nd district was once the GOP power base for former House Majority Leader Rep. Tom Delay. It is now a \u201cmajority-minority\u201d district in which Indian and Chinese immigrants may help elect the son of an Indian immigrant to Congress in November 2020.\n\nThe U.S. has a resident population of roughly 1.5 million college graduate visa workers who have forced down salaries for American college graduates. This massive subsidy for brand name employers, such as Amazon and Facebook, is largely ignored by the college graduates who work as journalists in the established media.\n\nSo far, no GOP senator has announced opposition to Lee\u2019s S.368 green card giveaway bill. The bill is backed by Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, WalMart, and other business groups that want to expand their business in India.\n\nCensus data shows how huge numbers of American software graduates have been replaced by Indian & Chinese visa-workers in N.J., California, N.C., Georgia, N.Y., Texas, Virginia, Florida, and other states.

As you know, \u201cComprehensive Immigration Reform\u201d is the catchword \u2026 There was a realization after this administration [got elected] that that was not likely. And so there have now been attempts to try to move things in a more piecemeal kind of fashion, the DREAM Act being one of those things.\n\nShahoulian told Democrats at the Georgetown event that Democrats must offer incentives to get cooperation from GOP legislators. But he provided a very skewed portrayal of the motivations:\n\nMany of you know this is the way I think: Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives are kind of wired differently, right? We [Democrats] are wired to be justice-oriented and outcome-orientated, like what\u2019s the just outcome? How do we get there? And how do we interpret the law to make sure that is it results in the most just outcome? Republicans really come at it by saying, \u201cWhat are the rules? You know, it\u2019s black and white. And did you follow the rules or not follow the rules? What does the law say, and what doesn\u2019t it say?\u201d That\u2019s just that\u2019s the way they approach the issues. Once you understand that they have a real legitimate \u2014 some of them are motivated by other things \u2014 but those who are motivated by just the rule of law. You have to figure out how to deal with that. They get that the rules were antiquated and that there weren\u2019t pathways, legal pathways, to really meet our economic needs. But you still have to recognize that people did something unlawful or are here unlawfully.\n\nBut business groups \u2014 and their allies among GOP politicians \u2014 merely use this \u201clegal good/illegal bad\u201d claim as a political fig leaf to conceal their eagerness to hire cheap migrants instead of Americans, Vaughan said.\n\nConservative Americans \u201ccare about the effects of the visa programs on their employment prospects, their taxes, and their communities,\u201d as their ethical priorities expand in circles around their own family, their community, the nation, and then to foreign peoples, she said.\n\nShahoulians\u2019s claim to be \u201cjustice-oriented,\u201d however, did not mention that Democrats\u2019 sense of justice telescopes out beyond Americans\u2019 concerns about their careers and families. In contrast to conservatives\u2019 expanding circles of concern, progressives\u2019 universalist mindset causes them to prefer caring about the distant peoples from Central America, India, and Africa. This mindset also encourages progressives to prefer foreigners who can strengthen the pro-diversity political party in the United States.", "description": "Republicans are working with Democrats to pass an amnesty for about 1 million illegal migrant farm laborers, according to a Democrat staffer.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/07/AP_060330030911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
