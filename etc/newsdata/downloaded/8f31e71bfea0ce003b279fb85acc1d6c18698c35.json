Ltd. (034220.SE) posted a bigger-than-expected loss in the third quarter, as lower liquid-crystal-display panel prices continued to pummel the electronics maker.\n\nNet loss for the September quarter was 442.20 billion Korean won ($377.0 million) compared with a net profit of KRW17.51 billion in the same quarter a year earlier, the South Korean company said Wednesday.\n\nThe third quarter loss was bigger than the KRW309.54 billion forecast by analysts on FactSet.\n\nRevenue during the quarter fell 4.6% on year to KRW5.822 trillion, the company said.\n\nOperating loss for the quarter stood at KRW436.74 billion--a swing from an operating profit of KRW140.07 billion a year ago.\n\nLG Display attributed the weak earnings to steeper-than-expected declines in LCD prices due to sluggish demand. The company said it is shifting toward the more promising organic light-emitting-diode display business.\n\nWrite to Kwanwoo Jun at kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 04:12 ET (08:12 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
