'I tried really hard, but it wasn't good enough. There are people that are passing me and improving, and I am just dropping to the bottom.'\n\nFor the show's Halloween night, she and partner Alan Bersten, 25, performed a jazz dance to Donna Summer's Bad Girls.\n\nShowing support: The 25-year-old reality star was supported by her co-stars after noting with her voice cracking that she was just a girl on reality TV who was trying her best\n\nHannah, who won Miss Alabama USA 2018, played a dead beauty queen and she vowed to forgo her sweet pageant ways for once.\n\n'I'm going to put all the past behind me and I am going to channel something completely different,' she announced.
