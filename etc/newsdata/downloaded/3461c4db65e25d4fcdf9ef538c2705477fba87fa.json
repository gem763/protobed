Fake news.\n\nThe image, which shows a trash-laden Hyde Park has been shared countless times on social media, mostly by accounts like \u201cAustralians against radical Islam\u201d and other anti-climate strikers. However, it doesn\u2019t even depict our own Hyde Park, it\u2019s actually the London park of the same name.\n\nNot only is it not Sydney, it\u2019s also not from a climate strike at all. The photo, which was originally posted in April 2019 is from a 420 cannabis rally that was actually cleaned up by popular environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion.\n\nHowever, despite a two-minute Twitter search proving that this photo is from at least April, the Australian Youth Coal Coalition still felt the need to share the image and claim it was the streets of Sydney.\n\n\u201cLook at the mess today\u2019s climate protesters left behind in beautiful Hyde Park. So much plastic. So much landfill,\u201d the post said before it was deleted.\n\nThe post had received nearly 10,000 comments and been shared over 34,000 times before it was deleted, spreading a vast amount of misinformation about the event and its participants.\n\nREAD MORE Engadine Maccas Signs Were Pooping Up Everywhere At Sydney's Bloody Huge Climate Strike\n\nApproximately 200,000 protesters flocked to city centres around Australia on Friday to strike for the climate, and thankfully didn\u2019t cause the trash pit that was left in London in April.\n\nThe strikes, which took place in various cities across the globe, were held to demand three primary targets, according to the SS4C website:\n\nNo new coal, oil and gas projects, including the Adani mine. 100% renewable energy generation & exports by 2030. Fund a just transition & job creation for all fossil-fuel workers & communities.\n\nSharing such misinformation, especially within a community that already questions the very existence of climate change is problematic to say the least. Friday\u2019s rallies saw people of all ages, genders, races and from all walks of life stand together to fight for the planet. This is no longer an issue that only young, \u201cgreen\u201d hippies care about. This is everyone\u2019s planet, and we all need to protect it.\n\nREAD MORE Five Key Things We Learned At Today's Enormous Melbourne Climate Strike", "description": "A photo currently circulating the internet claims to depict Sydney's climate strike aftermath, but in fact it's from a cannabis rally in England.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-21-at-7.27.44-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
