Taniela Tupou gave him a big smooch on the cheek.\n\n\"They're a different breed.\"\n\nSlice of wholesome content for your Saturday.\n\n\n\nJames Slipper is finally over!\n\n\n\nEvery Match, Every Nation of the #RWC2019 on Fox Sports pic.twitter.com/nt37imwRuO \u2014 FOX SPORTS Rugby (@FOXRUGBY) October 5, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nThe try took Australia to a 45-3 lead before Uruguay scored a late consolation try in the 78th minute \u2013 the country's first ever try against a tier one rugby nation at the World Cup.\n\nSlipper's drought-breaking try was one of many moments that gave stressed coach Michael Cheika reason to smile.\n\nTeenager Jordan Petaia starred on debut while winger Dane Haylett-Petty and outside centre Tevita Kuridrani both bagged doubles.\n\nPin. Point. Precise.\n\n\n\nA brilliant set piece from the @wallabies and the Train is through again for his second try! \ud83d\ude82\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa 26-3 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfe #AUSvURU #RWC2019 pic.twitter.com/ut8vXOAomi \u2014 10 Sport (@10SportAU) October 5, 2019 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nWinger Petaia crossed with his second touch as Australia ran in seven tries to one in humid conditions in Oita.\n\nThe performance was marred by first-half yellow cards shown to forwards Adam Coleman and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, both for high tackles.\n\nFrench referee Mathieu Raynal brandished his first yellow card when deeming Coleman had tackled fullback Rodrigo Silva around the shoulder.\n\nThat 14th minute infringement was followed 15 minutes later by a near-identical indiscretion from flanker Salakaia-Loto. Neither incident looked bad enough to earn a citing but both players will be nervous after lazy efforts.\n\nOther Australian high shots were also penalised in a concerning lack of discipline from Cheika\u2019s team, who were punished by match officials for similar offences in the opening win over Fiji and the loss to Wales.\n\nA 12-5 penalty count against them is a headache Cheika must address ahead of Friday\u2019s final pool clash with Georgia.\n\nCheika, however, was much more concerned with his team's slow start than his team's poor discipline.\n\n\u201cI thought we were just a little bit off the pace at the start,\u201d Cheika conceded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s three times now, three games a little bit off the pace at the start \u2014 I\u2019ll have to get my pre-match speech a little bit better.\n\n\u201cWe were in it in the first half nicely, but it looked like were just a click away and then we got the pace up in the second half.\n\n\u201cBut like I said before the match, the (Uruguayan) guys are big hearted and they take it to you and they\u2019ve obviously improved since the last World Cup, and I think we\u2019ve seen that directly because we\u2019ve played them.\u201d\n\nThe bonus point win means Australia have virtually locked down a quarter-final berth, with only a series of upsets able to deny them.\n\nThe remain on track to finish second in pool D but could yet claim top spot if Fiji upset Wales in Oita on Wednesday.\n\nPetaia was the brightest element to emerge from Australia\u2019s win.\n\nThe 19-year-old had limited opportunities but displayed a good work effort to secure his try and backed that up with a thrilling assist to Kuridrani in which he slid past three defenders and threw a memorable assist.\n\nAustralia\u2019s youngest player at the World Cup, Petaia made way at halftime in a pre-planned substitution.\n\nThe Wallabies went to another gear in the second spell, crossing four times against the 18th-ranked South Americans, who nevertheless had the final say through a try to No. 8 Manuel Diana.\n\n\u2013 with AAP", "description": "", "authors": ["Tyson Otto"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/edc5ccba7446ffa701ac34af07349b5c", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
