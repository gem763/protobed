It says that: \u201cThe use of surveillance in children\u2019s homes and residential family centres is only permissible at the direction of a court to safeguard an individual child\u2019s welfare.\u201d\n\nIt adds that any CCTV footage must be \u201ccontinually monitored\u201d in order to safeguard children. The new guidance states: \u201cWhen CCTV or audio monitoring is used for the protection of children, plans must include how enough staff will be available to continually monitor images and to take immediate action to safeguard children without reducing the quality of care provided in the home.\u201d\n\nOfsted said that changes have been made to clarify on which settings are covered by regulation and which by best practice principles.\n\nFollowing the publication of the new guidance yesterday [FRI], the Children\u2019s Commissioner said: \u201cThis is a welcome clarification and given the specific circumstances of the cases the Telegraph raised with us, it is clear in issuing fresh guidelines on the use of CCTV in these settings the government has taken seriously some of the concerns raised this summer.\u201d\n\nAn Ofsted spokeswoman said: There has been no change in the law or in Ofsted\u2019s approach to inspecting surveillance in children's social care. However, based on feedback from the social care sector \u2013 from children\u2019s homes managers, for example - we wanted our guidance to be clearer about what inspectors want to know when they ask providers about their use of CCTV.\u201d", "description": "Babies living with abusive parents under CCTV surveillance must be \u201ccontinually monitored\u201d, a watchdog has said following a Telegraph expose.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social Affairs Editor", "Rebecca Ryan", "Marcus Fysh", "Michael Deacon", "Juliet Samuel"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000206577886-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
