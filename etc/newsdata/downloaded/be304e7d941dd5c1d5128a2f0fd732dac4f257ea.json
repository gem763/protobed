He was canonised in 1976.\n\nCardinal Newman, himself, was born in 1801 the son of a London banker, and became a Church of England cleric before converting to Roman Catholicism in 1845.\n\nHe lived in Birmingham for some 40 years and, when he died aged 89, more than 15,000 people lined the city\u2019s streets for his funeral.\n\nHis path to sainthood came after he was credited with two miracles.\n\nThe first came in 2001 when Jack Sullivan, an American deacon from Massachusetts, attributed his recovery from a spinal cord disorder to the intervention of Cardinal Newman who he had prayed to.\n\nThe second was in 2013 when Chicago lawyer Melissa Villalobos claimed she had prayed to the churchman after her placenta tore while she was pregnant.\n\nThe 42-year-old told the Times: \u201c\u2019I said, \u2018Please Cardinal Newman make the bleeding stop\u2019. It stopped immediately.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Cardinal Newman, did you make the bleeding stop?\u2019 There was a burst of roses that filled the air... I knew I was cured.\u201d\n\nA service in the new saint\u2019s honour will also be held at Westminster Cathedral next week.\n\nRead more\n\nPope Francis claims US televangelist performed miracle", "description": "A Victorian priest and poet is set to become the UK\u2019s first saint of modern times in a historic ceremony in Rome this weekend.Cardinal John Henry Newman \u2013 a brilliant theologian widely credited with reviving Catholicism in 19th century England \u2013 will be canonised by Pope Francis in front of 20,000 onlookers", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.7118ceQBblC1KYZzCrl8A--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/635e9db09465629b858334319cd2b5b5", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
