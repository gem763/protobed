What can I say? We were going here for this medal and we got it and we are unbelievably happy.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s Oleg Verniaiev claimed the bronze medal after producing a spectacular routine on the parallel bars for the day\u2019s top score of 15.475.\n\nFor the first time in 25 years, all three podium spots for the men\u2019s all-around world title were occupied by European gymnasts.\n\nChina\u2019s Xiao Ruoteng, who finished second in Doha last year, was among the medal contenders until the final rotation, where he lost his grip on the high bar midway through his routine before returning to wrap up a below-par effort of 12.666.\n\nThe 2017 world champion finished fourth overall, while team mate Sun Wei came fifth.\n\n\u201cActually, today through my first five rotations I showed quite a high standard,\u201d Ruoteng said.\n\n\u201cI wanted to add difficulty to my all-around, and going to the high bar I was trailing by about 0.5 so I was weighing up adding difficulty and I decided to do so.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m closest to Nagornyy in terms of level.\u201d\n\nComing into Stuttgart, Nagornyy was ranked among the heavy favourites for the event after winning the European all-around title earlier this year in Szczecin.\n\nThe 22-year-old\u2019s European Championships performance had been the best score recorded this season until he bettered it by 0.107 in front of a raucous crowd in Stuttgart.\n\nDalaloyan conceded his title to Nagornyy after a poor landing off the vault for 14.066, which included a 0.1 penalty.\n\nBut he recovered well in the final two rotations, earning scores of 15.233 and 14.233 on the parallel bars and high bar respectively.\n\nAmerican\u2019s six-time national champion Sam Mikulak was the surprise leader at the halfway stage but mistakes on the pommel horse in the penultimate rotation meant he came seventh overall.", "description": "Russia's Nikita Nagornyy clinched the men's all-around title at the gymnastics world championships on Friday ahead of last year's champion and team mate Artur Dalaloyan in Stuttgart.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439779795&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1RZ-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
