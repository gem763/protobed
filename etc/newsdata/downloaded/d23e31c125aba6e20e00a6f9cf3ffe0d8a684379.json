The Australia-wide initiative currently only allows state and territory law enforcement agencies to have access to the country's new face matching services to access passport, visa, citizenship, and driver licence images from other jurisdictions.\n\nThe Identity-Matching Services Bill, if passed, would authorise DHA to operate the central photo-matching hub for communicating between agencies, allowing for the collection, use, and disclosure of identification information to provide identity matching services that employ facial biometric matching.\n\nThe Australian Passports Amendment Bill, originally labelled by former Foreign Minister Julie Bishop as being aimed at allowing real-time crime fighting, provides a legal basis for ensuring the minister is able to make Australian travel document data available.\n\nThe PJCIS in April asked the government to be more transparent on the biometric Bills, specifically asking it take into account its recommendations when developing any future strategies for biometric data and facial recognition systems.\n\nThe committee also called for the development of an appropriate regime to detect, audit, report on, respond to, and guard against events that may breach biometric data security. It also asked for the development of methods that assess the implications of any security breach, as well as how it would communicate the breach to both the general public and the technical, privacy, and security communities.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Extending biometrics access to the Stuart Robert-led department would help it thwart fraud, and ensure welfare is being distributed to the right people, it has said.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/17/28e2f1bd-926b-44ed-a63e-322ce5501a83/thumbnail/770x578/9ecbb91d884d3864eccdc72f9b06c2f3/biometric.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
