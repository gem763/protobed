Candice is said to be upset at Gordeno's friendship with her daughter Francesca (left), pictured with the couple on holiday two years ago\n\nSpeaking to MailOnline, Candice said she felt 'deeply upset', admitting: 'I have fallen out with Francesca over this and are now no longer on speaking terms. She knows how how I feel about this man and I feel it is a betrayal.\n\n'Francesca knows how he treated me and our history together. He had proposed and we were going to get married, then it was all off. I don't know if I can ever forgive her.'\n\nCandice, who runs a upmarket dog grooming business in Weybridge, Surrey, said she was stunned when she first discovered she had been dumped for Ms Cundy and is shocked to learn that her daughter is spending time with her former partner.\n\nFrancesca (pictured) is said to have been spending increasing amounts of time with Gordeno in recent weeks, which has upset her mother who dated the businessman before Ms Cundy\n\nFrancesca, who has a child from a previous relationship, has moved out of the family home she shared with her mother and the pair are said to be 'no longer speaking' over the friendship\n\nShe went on: 'He is more than twice her age and I don't feel it's appropriate.\n\n'She has denied anything is going on, but they have been spotted in the pub together and she was seen getting out of his car.\n\nMother of one Francesca has moved out of the home she shared with her mother in Cobham, Surrey, and went to stay with an aunt a few miles away in Guildford.\n\nHer grandfather Robert told MailOnline: 'I've heard about this friendship and no one in the family is particularly happy about it and it's caused a bit of a rift.'\n\nCandice, pictured centre on holiday with Francesca, right, told MailOnline that she is angry with her daughter for becoming close to Gordeno after she was with him for two years\n\nEarlier Entrepreneur Gordeno praised Ms Cundy in his statement, calling her 'fun and beautiful Lizzie'.\n\n'I will always be very fond of Lizzie,' he said. 'But events outside our control put our relationship under huge strain. I have come to realise it's best we stay just friends.\n\n'The last few months have been like a soap opera. Lizzie and I have been the innocent victim of some wild and false accusations. Life with Lizzie is tremendous fun...\n\n'We got on really well from the word go. We didn't stop laughing for weeks. Our friend told Lizzie before we met, 'Jeremy will cheer you up' and I hope I did. She's not only beautiful but great company.\n\nGordeno, pictured leaving a property in Guildford, Surrey, who at 53 is 32 years older than Francesca, paid tribute to 'fun Lizzie' as he announced the end of their relationship today\n\n'Lizzie's a super girl who is loads of fun. I wish her all the best for the future and hope we can stay good pals.'\n\nMeanwhile TV personality Lizzie who was previously married to footballer Jason Cundy, insisted she had dumped him when she told MailOnline: 'I ended it. I want nothing more to do with him. I'm shocked and horrified by recent events'.\n\nThe former couple had been introduced through a mutual friend in a Weybridge wine bar and had been seen together at a number of society events as their romance blossomed.\n\nBut their relationship ran into trouble in May when Lizzie was confronted by Candice as she posed for a glam photoshoot at Gordeno's home.\n\nToday Lizzie insisted she'd called time on the fling with millionaire Gordeno and said she wants nothing more to do with him. It is unclear if she knows of his friendship with Francesca (left)\n\nThe former WAG was called a 'f***ing whore' as she was being pictured with her then-lover by the pool at his mansion.\n\nShe was yelled at by Gordeno\u2019s former finac\u00e9e Candice, who had stormed on to the set after letting herself into the house.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun, Candice revealed she branded Cundy a 'f**king whore' in the showdown, as she explained: 'All the cameras were around her. I don\u2019t normally swear but I couldn\u2019t help myself. I shouted, \"You f***ing whore!\".'\n\nClearly heartbroken, Candice claimed Gordeno had revealed he wanted to start a family with her.\n\nAnnouncing the end of their relationship, Gordeno said: 'I will always be very fond of Lizzie. But events outside our control put our relationship under huge strain and it's best we stay friends'\n\nThey have been a couple since 2016 but friends of the tycoon say he broke off the relationship before romancing Cundy.\n\nAfter the nightclub owner proposed in Italy, she revealed she had made the shocking discovery of his romance with Cundy.\n\nShe said: 'I felt everything crumble around me. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing and I couldn\u2019t believe he was telling me to leave and not her. We have been through so much together.\n\n'I was crying. I said to him, \u2018Three years and you treat me like this for her?\u2019 As I was leaving I said, \u2018He asked me to marry me, we have been looking for rings, why have you done this?\u2019.'\n\nFrancesca and Gordeno have not responded to requests for a comment.", "description": "Lizzie Cundy split from her partner millionaire nightclub boss Jeremy Gordeno, 53, after he was pictured looking cosy (right) with Francesca Hodge, the 21-year-old daughter of his ex-lover.", "authors": ["Paul Thompson", "Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/20/19604154-0-image-a-45_1570821622747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
