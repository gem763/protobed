Its popularity has also pushed another face-swap app, Yanji, to fifth place on the list. Behind Zao is a company fully owned by Chinese hookup and live-streaming service Momo Inc. President Wang Li and co-Founder Lei Xiaoliang, according to public company registration documents.\n\nUsers of the app upload a photo of themselves to drop their likeness into popular scenes from hundreds of movies or TV shows. It\u2019s a chance to be the star and swap places with the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Leonardo DiCaprio or Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory in a matter of moments.\n\nThe photo uploads have proven problematic, however. A user can provide an existing photo or, following on-screen prompts, create a series of photos where they blink their eyes and open their mouth to help create a more realistic deepfake. An earlier version of Zao\u2019s user agreement stated that the app had \u201cfree, irrevocable, permanent, transferable, and relicense-able\u201d rights to all this user-generated content. Zao has since updated its terms \u2014 the app now says it won\u2019t use headshots or mini videos uploaded by users for purposes other than to improve the app or things pre-agreed by users. If users delete the content they uploaded, the app will erase it from its servers as well.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Many users complained about the privacy issue.\n\n\u201cWe understand the concern about privacy. We\u2019ve received the feedback, and will fix the issues that we didn\u2019t take into consideration, which will need a bit of time,\u201d a statement posted to Zao\u2019s account on social-media platform Weibo said.\n\nOn Monday, the China E-Commerce Research Center urged authorities to look into the matter. The app \u201cviolates certain laws and standards set by the nation and the industry,\u201d the research house said in a statement, citing Wang Zheng of the Taihang Law Firm.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time such face-swapping apps have enjoyed popularity either in China or around the world, but Zao\u2019s smooth and quick integration of faces into videos and internet memes is what makes it stand out.\n\nThe machine learning technology underpinning deepfakes of this kind has matured rapidly, to the point where it can believably impersonate famous personalities like Joe Rogan and make them say whatever the aspiring faker types. U.S. politicians are wrestling with the issue of how to regulate this emergent misinformation threat, and top Democrat Adam Schiff has described it as a source of \u201cnightmarish scenarios\u201d for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAt the individual level, FaceApp is the most famous and notorious deepfake face-modification app to date. It went viral globally on two different occasions, showing people how they\u2019d look in their old age or with their gender flipped. The app also kicked up an unintentional privacy scare with its practice of uploading images to servers to be processed, illustrating a growing sensitivity to how user data is handled.\n\nAfter users flooded WeChat, China\u2019s most widely used social media platform, with Zao-enabled short clips and GIFs, the Tencent Holdings Ltd.-operated messaging app banned links to the service, saying there have been numerous reports about it presenting \u201csecurity risks.\u201d Tencent didn\u2019t immediately comment on the decision.\n\n\u201cI just realized the terms are so unfair but it\u2019s too late,\u201d one unhappy iOS reviewer of Zao wrote. \u201cNowadays people don\u2019t usually bother to read them.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish, hooligan software,\u201d added another reviewer.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Chinese face-swap app Zao rocketed to the top of app store charts over the weekend before its privacy implications began to sink in.", "authors": ["Colum Murphy", "Zheping Huang"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/chinese-face-swap-deepfake-app.jpg?quality=85&w=724&h=483&crop=1"}
