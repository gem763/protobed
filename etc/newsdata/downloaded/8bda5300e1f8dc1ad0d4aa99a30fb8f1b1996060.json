Ever since, UK politicians have been struggling to finalise a deal with the EU - but the agreed upon October 31 deadline fast approaching. So what exactly is a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit? And what can we expect from it, aside from possible economic chaos?\n\nWhat is a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit?\n\nThink of it as a very sudden divorce. The UK would immediately leave the European Union, as well as any of its governing bodies including the European Court of Justice and Europol, as the BBC notes. But there\u2019s no question that the UK\u2019s economy would suffer at the hands of a sudden Brexit.\n\nOn Thursday, the British pound \u2014 which has been vulnerable since the Brexit vote in June 2016 \u2014 slipped 1.1 per cent following the announcement of Johnson\u2019s request to the Queen.\n\nBelow are other likely repercussions of an immediate exit from the EU:\n\nTrade disruptions. The UK\u2019s exports will immediately be subject to EU tariffs, threatening the competitiveness of its products. This will greatly impact the country\u2019s agriculture industry. (And the process will likely involve tons of extra paperwork and customs.)\n\nFood, medicine and fuel shortages.\n\nTravel disruptions. \u201cAviation, currency, insurance, mobile phone roaming, and passport control are all likely to be affected,\u201d CNN writes.\n\nPhoto: Daniel Leal-Olivas, Getty Images\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nPublicly, Johnson has denied the suspension\u2019s connection to Brexit; in a letter to Parliament, he has said that he plans to announce \u201ca new bold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda.\u201d\n\nAs the Financial Times writes, he can\u2019t announce this legislation unless the current parliamentary session has ended and a new one has commenced. (This must be accomplished during the Queen\u2019s Speech or the state opening of Parliament. The speech lays out which priorities Parliament will focus on in its session.)\n\nBut Johnson is likely pursuing a suspension so that he can proceed with a no-deal with as little pushback as possible from critics. They\u2019ll have very little time to come up with an alternative deal or any recourse, for that matter.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nJohnson has called for a five-week suspension, following the second \u201csitting week\u201d in September (starting sometime between September 9-12). With Parliament returning from a summer break on September 3, this allows just days for them to respond.\n\nAs CNN writes, Parliament could vote no-confidence in their government \u2014 which might, at the very least, postpone ongoing events \u2014 but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll receive enough support from conservative lawmakers. Or they could pass legislation that would extend EU membership beyond the deadline.\n\nUnder the five-week suspension plan, a new Parliamentary session would resume on October 14. Johnson has already announced plans for the UK to leave the EU by October 31 \u2014 regardless of a deal.\n\nThis story has been updated since its original publication.", "description": "It has been over three years since people in the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union in a referendum result that shocked the world.
