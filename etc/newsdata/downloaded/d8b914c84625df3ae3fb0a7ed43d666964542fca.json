Before GST was rolled out and everything was kinda cheap.\n\nThe Big Bridge will also be slamming through all the top hits from 1998 all through October, so if you\u2019re wanting to fight against a newfound fear of heights while listening to All Saints\u2019 \u2018Never Ever\u2018, or Jennifer Paige\u2019s \u2018Crush\u2018 (both certified dick-slapping tunes), you can do just that.\n\nPlus there\u2019s apparently a light-up dancefloor at the top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge (exCUSE ME???) so you can have a boogie to Ricky Martin and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones atop the iconic bridge.\n\nTickets for the Big Birthday Bridge Climbs go on sale from 9am on September 12, so maybe act fast on that one and cop a spot in the very attractive coveralls over on the BridgeClimb website.", "description": "To celebrate the 21st anniversary of the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb, you'll be able to scale the national icon for the price of a 1998 ticket in October.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/keith-urban-20014-bridgeclimb-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
