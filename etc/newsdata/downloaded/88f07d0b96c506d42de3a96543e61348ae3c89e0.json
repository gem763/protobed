He said many in the audience were 'brought in' from elsewhere\n\nProtesters and supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump clashed in front of Benedict College as the president spoke at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum\n\nBenedict College spokeswoman Kymm Hunter confirmed only seven of those who were ask to come along did actually attend.\n\nMayor Benjamin said the college had requested space for more students but the White House organized the event. He said many in the audience of more than 200 were 'brought in' from elsewhere.\n\nHe added: 'This should have been an opportunity for at least scores of students to attend this event.'\n\nSouth Carolina NAACP condemned Trump's words ahead of the visit.\n\nUsing an argument that he also made when he ran for president in 2016, Trump said on Friday that generations of Democratic policies had failed minority communities.\n\n'We've had so many people with empty political rhetoric. We're doing the opposite. We're acting, not talking,' he said.\n\nThe president opened a forum on criminal justice reform, touting his support for sweeping reforms that he hopes will help him pick up more votes among African-Americans next year. But just a handful of students studying there were invited to the event\n\nThe decision to invite Trump to the college also sparked fierce backlash online.\n\nCommenting on the official Benedict College Facebook page one person called them 'sell outs'.\n\nDale J Haberkorn wrote: 'Sad that you fell for the president's PR stunt! Only TEN students were invited and the rest of the crowd was shipped in. What a SCAM. I can't believe you fell for it.\n\n'Why didn't you let students protest? They were told to stay in their dorms! Rich old men blocking the freedom of African Americans again! You should have DECLINED!'\n\nLinda Forge added: 'President of Benedict College why are you allowing someone to come to your college that does not represent Black folks values. He is only wanting to get Black votes because he can not win without them. Why?'\n\nAnd Laurie Gayle Brown added: 'What WERE you thinking??? I understand that some 10 students were allowed in the room and the rest of the audience were gathered from the ranks of the trumpists. How is that benefiting your students???'\n\nAnn Porter called the decision 'shameful', writing: 'Cannot believe Benedict would drop this low. Come on now. #45 has used you.'\n\nU.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California canceled her appearance at the forum and planned to speak elsewhere after Trump received the Bipartisan Justice award\n\nTrump is embraced by Matthew Charles, who was released from prison through the First Step Act. South Carolina NAACP condemned Trump's words ahead of the visit\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and six other Democratic contenders will also present their criminal justice plans at the forum.\n\nThe weekend forum is aimed at tackling the next steps in criminal justice reforms after Trump last year signed bipartisan legislation that instituted a number of changes, including easing harsh minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n'I hope you will judge my administration based on the tremendous amount we have achieved,' Trump said in his keynote speech. Trump won just eight per cent of the black vote in 2016 and there are few indications that he has turned the tide since.", "description": "The president was at Benedict College to open the\u00a0criminal justice reform forum on Friday but just a handful of students studying there were invited and fewer turned up.", "authors": ["Lauren Fruen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/06/20208216-0-image-a-93_1572069271843.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
