Eighteen years after the conflict began, and shortly after peace negotiations had fallen apart in September, Pentagon officials anonymously confirmed that total troop levels could sink as low as 8,600. That\u2019s about what the goal of the now-failed peace negotiations had been. But instead of a formal withdrawal, troops are being cycled out and not replaced as tours end.\n\nEnthusiasm for the conflict in Afghanistan has decreased among the public and among at least some factions in the Trump administration. It\u2019s not hard to see why.\n\nSetting aside the human cost, the price tag for the nation\u2019s longest war is immense, to say the least. In her 2018 \u201cCosts of War\u201d report, Boston University scholar Neta C. Crawford provides the most comprehensive total estimate of overall U.S. war spending by totaling Defense and State Department requests from fiscal year 2001-2018. She finds that all wars during that time cost $2.022 trillion. Of that, $975 billion (roughly 48 percent) was due to Afghanistan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut direct expenditures alone present an incomplete picture of Afghanistan\u2019s true cost. While there is not currently a standalone report estimating total costs in Afghanistan specifically, an upcoming report soon to be produced by my organization will provide just that. We draw from other reports and budget requests over time to estimate that the total cost of the war, including direct costs as well as indirect costs such as medical and disability care, could be as high as $2 trillion since the war began.\n\nNeither estimate, of course, can even begin to fully account for other unseen and related costs, whether strain on equipment that must be replaced or repaired sooner, or the immense human cost of the conflict that will be present for years to come.\n\nDrawing down U.S. involvement \u2013 whether in the open by peace agreement, in secret by cycling out or in another manner entirely \u2013 has the potential to save billions and please a nation weary of war.\n\nMost Americans, including most active duty military members and veterans, favor a new direction in foreign policy. They agree with the president\u2019s long-stated position that it is time to wind down our nation\u2019s longest war in Afghanistan. A June 2019 Pew Research Center survey found, in fact, that \u201cmajorities of both veterans (58 percent) and the public (59 percent) say the war in Afghanistan was not worth fighting.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, at a time when national priorities are more strained than ever under a $22 trillion national debt and historic deficits, these savings offer President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE an opportunity to reclaim his long-forgotten campaign promises of reducing the deficit and saving taxpayer money.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen examining various cost-of-war studies, our upcoming report identifies the savings of a potential withdrawal at between $150 billion to $280 billion over the next four years. This estimate counts direct war costs alone, and when factoring in other related costs such as veteran health care and wear and tear on equipment, the cost savings could rise to over $400 billion.\n\nForeign policy goals are complex and ever-changing, to be sure. But as the U.S. role in Afghanistan has shifted and expanded over the years from a strike against the culprits of 9/11, to nation-building, to an undefined and indefinite involvement, the time is ripe for rethinking these goals. Taxpayers should hope President Trump and his administration continue in this direction.\n\nJonathan Bydlak is a fiscal policy expert and president of the Institute for Spending Reform, which spearheads SpendingTracker.org.", "description": "Enthusiasm for the conflict in Afghanistan has decreased among the public and from at least some factions in the Trump administration.
