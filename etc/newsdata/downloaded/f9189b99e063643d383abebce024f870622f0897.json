I don't want contactless and signed a form with HSBC years ago to opt-out from being sent a contactless debit card.\n\nHowever, they now seem to be making it more difficult to opt-out and keep sending me contactless cards, and my nearest HSBC branch is a 44-mile round trip from where I live in Lancashire.\n\nI don't want to switch away, but what is the law around this? Do banks have to offer you a non-contactless card if you ask? \u2013 J.D., via telephone\n\nContactless is booming as an alternative way to pay for many Britons, but if you don't want such a card what can you do?\n\nGeorge Nixon, This is Money, replies: Contactless payments may be an increasingly ubiquitous part of our financial lives but the system is not for everyone.\n\nWhile new rules are due to come in that restrict how many contactless transactions you can make in between using your Pin to verify your card, there are still likely plenty of people worried about the prospect of someone making off with their card and helping themselves to their bank balance.\n\nThere are also concerns over skimming, with contactless fraudsters stealing money from unwitting victims.\n\nThis is Money reported on the desire not to have contactless cards four years ago, but it's clear that it's still causing a problem for some customers who feel as if they are being pressured by banks into accepting something they do not want.\n\nNone of the major UK banks send out debit cards that are not contactless by default anymore, but your question was whether there is a law or rule requiring banks to provide you with one that isn't contactless if you ask for it.\n\nUK Finance, the trade body that represents the banking and financial services sector, told This is Money that there's no rule you can use to back yourself up.\n\nIt said: 'Individual firms will decide whether to issue a non-contactless card based on their own card issuance policy.'\n\nOne major high street bank also confirmed to us there were no specific regulations in place when it comes to this, and that it is down to the card issuer whether they want to provide an opt out or not.\n\nNow, for those like yourself who do not wish to have a contactless debit card this is not welcome news, especially if it means in the future banks may refuse an opt out.\n\nHSBC does allow customers to request non-contactless cards by calling it directly or visting it in-branch\n\nHow to avoid having a contactless card\n\nLuckily, most of the biggest UK current account providers realise there are plenty of people like yourself around and say that if you ask them they will send you a non-contactless card.\n\nYour own bank, HSBC, allows its customers to request non-contactless cards over the phone, or by visiting it in-branch.\n\nThe country's biggest current account provider, Lloyds Banking Group, which runs Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland said while it issues contactless debit cards as standard, customers can request an opt out and be issued with a chip and pin only card if they want.\n\nBarclays and TSB also offer non-contactless cards should customers wish to have one, as does Nationwide Building Society.\n\nNationwide added that if a customer opts for a non-contactless card, 'a flag is put on the system meaning that they will continue to receive a non-contactless card in future.'\n\nLloyds Banking Group, which runs Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland, is the country's largest current account provider. It allows customers to opt-out from contactless if they want\n\nMeanwhile, Santander issues contactless cards automatically but customers can opt out when they apply by applying in-branch, or if they apply online by requesting a non-contactless version once they have applied, over the phone or in-branch.\n\nRBS and NatWest say by default the majority of customers are given a contactless card. However, if customers wish, they can request a non-contactless 'Full Authorisation' card.\n\nThe drawback worth noting is that with this card offline transactions are not possible, meaning it will not work on tolls, trains, boats, planes and unattended petrol pumps.\n\nCustomers can request this card in branch or by telephone.\n\nHowever, newer banks Metro Bank and Monzo, which of course doesn't have any branches and is smartphone only, only issue contactless cards, so they are unlikely to be the best choice in your situation.\n\nWhile you say you don't want to switch away, it is worth noting if you are ever unhappy with the options your bank is offering you or the service you've had, the Current Account Switch Service promises to switch over your account, including any direct debits, within seven days.\n\nYou can read This is Money's guide to the best current accounts to see which banks offer you bonuses for switching.", "description": "HSBC now seem to be making it more difficult to opt-out despite me doing so years ago, and my nearest HSBC branch is a 44-mile round trip from where I live in Lancashire.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
