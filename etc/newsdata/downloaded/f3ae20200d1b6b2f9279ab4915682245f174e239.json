John Barrasso: Trump showed \u2018backbone\u2019 canceling Taliban talks", "language": "en", "text": "President Trump was correct in canceling planned peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan, Republican Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Monday.\n\nAppearing on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d the Senate Foreign Relations Committee member said that in addition to showing \u201cbackbone,\u201d the president also exhibited the \u201cright instincts and right judgment.\n\n\u201cHe is willing to talk to anybody,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cHe\u2019s also willing to walk away from a bad deal and a deal with the Taliban would\u2019ve been a bad deal here.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed a terror attack by the Taliban last Thursday for the cancelation of the planned talks at Camp David this weekend that the administration had hoped would lead to a peace agreement.\n\nTRUMP SAYS TALKS WITH TALIBAN ARE \"DEAD,' AFTER CANCELING SECRET CAMP DAVID SUMMIT\n\nOn \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace asked Pompeo, \u201cWho thought it was a good idea for the President of the United States to meet with Taliban leaders, who have the blood of thousands of Americans on their hands, just three days before 9/11?\u201d\n\nPompeo said that they were aware of the history of Camp David and that they \u201creflected on that as we were thinking about how to deliver for the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so, as we considered the right path forward, you talked about an agreement in principle, I think that\u2019s true. We weren\u2019t complete,\u201d Pompeo admitted.\n\nAnother Wyoming Republican, Liz Cheney, decried any potential future meeting for the Taliban at Camp David.\n\nPEACE TALKS WITH AFGHANS, TALIBAN CALLED OFF AFTER TRUMP CANCELS SECRET MEETING\n\nShe wrote on Twitter: \u201cCamp David is where America\u2019s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11. No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever. The Taliban still harbors al Qaeda. The President is right to end the talks.\u201d\n\nBoth the Taliban and administration officials have left the door open to a resumption of negotiations, but the death of an American soldier in the attack -- Sergeant First Class Elis Barreto Ortiz -- was the 16th this year and one of many since talks began almost a year ago.\n\nAdditionally, Taliban negotiators claimed Sunday that they had agreed to come to the United States only after a deal was announced and solely to meet with the American side and not the Afghani government.\n\nAhead of a rally in North Carolina on Monday night, Trump told reporters the only reason he canceled the meeting was because the Taliban had killed Americans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead. As far as I am concerned, they are dead,\u201d he said.\n\nOn \"America's Newsroom,\" Barrasso commented: \u201cThe Taliban was continuing to work by terrorizing the talks. That is not a way to get a peace agreement.\n\n\u201cBut, he\u2019s a president of action -- he wants to get things done. So, he\u2019s willing to talk. He leads through action: looking for results, looking for solutions.\"", "description": "President Trump was correct in canceling planned peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan, Republican Sen.
