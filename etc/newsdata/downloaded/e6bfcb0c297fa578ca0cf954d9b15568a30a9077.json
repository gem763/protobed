Mr Bolton was fired last month.\n\nThe call's transcript was moved within hours of the 9am call under the direction of White House lawyers, according to the whistleblower's complaint.\n\nAccording to the Post, one official went immediately to Mr Eisenberg after hearing the call, and he told an official that he would \"follow-up\" on the warnings he had received, though it\u2019s not clear whether he did.The Post quoted one person familiar with events in the White House that \u201calarm bells were kind of ringing\u201d as events unfolded.\n\nOfficials sounding alarms were not part of the so-called \"swamp\" nor the \"deep state.\" according to a former senior official speaking to the Post, but rather they were White House officials \u201cwho got concerned about this because this is not the way they want to see the government run\".\n\nThe concerns contradict Trump\u2019s assertion that the phone call was \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d and that subsequent impeachment threats are part of a Democratic \u201cwitch hunt garbage\u201d.", "description": "At least four national security officials flagged to a White House lawyer their concerns about the Trump administration's political dealings with Ukraine - even before President Donald Trump\u2019s July phone call with that country\u2019s president, according to The Washington Post.Official warnings to National", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s.SUGBo3rlpfUYu0n_iLhQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/c39f117fd084abf338e6bc9208d0be88", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
