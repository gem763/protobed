Others followed suit, including Greek Hoaxes, a group dedicated to uncovering fake news.\n\nGreek Hoaxes accused Ms Antoniadou of misrepresenting her achievements and hit back with a series of counterclaims.\n\nWhat she has achieved:\n\nClaim: She worked on the world's first artificial trachea that was successfully transplanted to a patient.\n\nCounterclaim: She was a postgraduate student at UCL and was remotely involved with the surgery. The transplant ended with one of the biggest scandals in modern medicine, covered here by the BBC. The patient died after his body did not accept the transplant. Long after his death, Ms Antoniadou gave interviews in Greece saying how she had saved the patient's life and how the patient was living a normal life.\n\nClaim: She has been working for a number of years as a researcher at Nasa.\n\nCounterclaim: She attended a 10-week summer school there and took a lot of pictures around the US space agency's facilities wearing clothes with the Nasa logo. Nasa has denied she works directly for the agency, but has not excluded the possibility that she may be working as a sub-contractor.\n\nClaim: She has called herself a PhD.\n\nCounterclaim: She holds two postgraduate titles.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption In 2017, Eleni Antoniadou (L) took part in a Lisbon seminar for European Young Leaders\n\nClaim: She is a successful entrepreneur and CEO of a company called Transplants without Donors that makes artificial transplants.\n\nCounterclaim: Her company does not appear anywhere and the internet domain that it owns is inactive.\n\nWho did she convince?\n\nGreek media had for years portrayed and promoted her as the brightest mind Greece has produced in decades. The constant publicity often culminated in various kinds of honours.\n\nGlobal toy maker Mattel has even made a Barbie doll looking like her, as part of its series \"Sheroes\".\n\nAnd the centre-right European People's Party tweeted a poster with the most important Greeks of the past century including her image at the centre.\n\nShe even managed to get on the lists of the BBC's 100 Women for 2014 and Forbes' 30 Under 30 list for 2015.\n\nHow has she responded?\n\nAs the stories about the young scientist began to swirl, Eleni Antoniadou posted a cropped image of a Nasa award of merit on social media insisting she had been working for Nasa, and she denied trying to compete with older academics.\n\nImage copyright Eleni Antoniadou/Facebook\n\n\"Every day I continue to learn by participating in simple or more complicated projects, like that of AI at Nasa with which I'm involved lately,\" she wrote.\n\n\"For me the goal was never to compete with academia or compare my first steps in science as a new researcher with people who have been around for decades. At the end of the day, the important thing is to work always collaboratively, by helping the people around you go forward and not to go a step downwards.\"\n\nThe BBC tried to get in touch with Ms Antoniadou but she was not available for comment.", "description": "Eleni Antoniadou has been feted for her scientific work but her rise is the focus of intense scrutiny.", "authors": ["Kostas Kallergis", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2374/production/_108867090_eleni.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
