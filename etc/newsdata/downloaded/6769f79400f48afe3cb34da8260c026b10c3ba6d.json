Lyft is also reducing the roles of the trained specialists hired to make the judgment calls on whether to boot them.\n\nDrivers who were previously deactivated and ask to have their cases reviewed could be reinstated based on new standards, according to internal documents and interviews with current and former employees familiar with the new system, as it reduced the responsibilities of those who disabled many of their accounts.\n\nIt\u2019s one of several changes Lyft has made to its safety processes since going public earlier this year.\n\nSome current and former employees say the changes pose safety risks because they introduce a black-and-white decision structure for situations that may call for human judgment. Critics assert it\u2019s similar to cost-cutting measures taken at other companies when streamlining operations and could allow Lyft to increase its share of drivers amid a heated market share battle with rival Uber.\n\nLyft says the new structure is aimed at removing bias from important safety decisions and establishing a clear policy on unacceptable behavior \u2014 and not for cost cutting. Incidents can be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. And there have been no fewer deactivations of drivers on average, Lyft spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna said in a statement.\n\n[How Lyft lost the trust of #DeleteUber women who thought it was \u2018woke\u2019]\n\nThe ride-hailing giant is facing growing scrutiny over passenger safety because of allegations that it doesn\u2019t treat women\u2019s reports of sexual harassment appropriately. The Washington Post reported in August on the concerns of women who reported instances of sexual harassment and other types of misconduct by Lyft drivers, after which they said the company failed to take enough action. And more than a dozen women are suing Lyft in San Francisco, alleging they were raped or sexually assaulted and that Lyft let \u201cknown sexual predators\u201d give rides and concealed sexual assault complaints in multiple locations.\n\nThe company has made a number of changes to its platform amid the scrutiny, adding new safety features like continuous background checks and a feature that automatically senses when a ride veers off course, though it said those features had been long in the works.\n\nLyft instituted its new safety processes in June. Safety team members now follow a set of standard guidelines to determine whether a driver has committed an offense to prompt deactivation, according to the documents and employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nPreviously, lower-tier team members said they had the ability to identify potentially dangerous behavior from drivers when riders reported feeling unsafe and preemptively boot them for good. They had the flexibility to ban drivers for a pattern of behavior demonstrating a lack of fitness, such as repeatedly prompting customers for details about their trip or asking personal questions such as whether they live at the drop-off destination or are single.\n\nNow the lower-level team must follow stiff guidelines that could result in drivers staying online until after a more serious incident, and recommendations to review a serious case are approved by a new team that makes the final decision based on those criteria, employees say. Those specialists, called Safety Policy and Community Compliance, make the decision based on whether deactivating a driver lines up with the standards established in the company\u2019s new \u201cdecision matrix.\u201d Details on those specific criteria were not available. Lyft said that patterns of behavior are addressed in the guidelines.\n\n[Internal data shows Uber\u2019s reputation hasn\u2019t changed much since #DeleteUber]\n\nLyft has not informed drivers they can ask for a review. But in documents obtained by The Post, the company tells employees that if a driver or rider had been permanently banned, \u201cthe decision can be reassessed by SPCC team members.\u201d\n\nLyft already is incentivized to maintain as many drivers as possible as it competes with rival Uber, the employees said. The more drivers with access to the platform, the shorter the wait times and fares, according to its stock market filing and other public guidance from Lyft.\n\nLyft\u2019s LaManna said in a statement that the company can still make decisions to deactivate drivers on a case-by-case basis, guided by the newly standardized system.\n\n\u201cThis team follows a rigorous process to determine when drivers should be deactivated from Lyft, representing one further action toward our goal of making Lyft the safest form of transportation for everyone,\u201d LaManna said. The process aims to cut down on the previous differences in how specialists decided on deactivations, as well as eliminating the need for critical safety decisions to rest in the hands of individuals.\n\n[Lyft announces safety changes advocated by victims in wake of scrutiny]\n\nAcademic and legal experts say the standardization of how to remove drivers at Lyft could shield the company from allegations that its processes are unscientific or unfair. The current and former employees said there was sometimes a variation between how many drivers one specialist would deactivate on a weekly basis compared with another. The new system, which involves a computer-guided process to help determine whether a case should be considered for deactivation, aims to create consistency.\n\n\u201cRemoving human nuance around something as sensitive around which drivers are barred or disbarred \u2026 is an effort to reduce costs and to abdicate responsibility,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business who has focused on the technology industry.\n\nLyft\u2019s changes come as the company\u2019s valuation has been sliced in half since it went public in late March and reported a $644 million quarterly loss in the second quarter. The company reported strong revenue growth in the most recent financial period, however, posting a narrower loss of about $463 million.\n\nStock prices rose initially in after-hours trading on the results, as well as a revised financial outlook that predicted higher-than-expected growth and revenue going forward. Lyft said its quarterly revenue grew to $956 million, a 63 percent increase compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nIn the internal documents viewed by The Post, the safety team changes were described as an extension of a model introduced earlier in the year to offer a \u201cbest experience at low cost,\u201d a new companywide mantra.\n\n[Sen. Blumenthal assails how Uber and Lyft deal with driver misconduct following Washington Post report]\n\nLyft\u2019s LaManna said that it invests more resources and talent in safety every year. \u201cThe changes we made earlier this year were steps taken to improve the safety of the platform, and any suggestion to the contrary is uninformed and false,\u201d she added in a statement. \u201cThey were not intended to \u2014 nor have they \u2014 cut costs for the company.\u201d\n\nTrust and Safety head Mary Winfield will be leaving the company, effective Nov. 8, the company confirmed. She announced the decision internally last week, saying it was a personal choice and that she did not have any immediate plans. The reason for her departure and her replacement was not immediately clear. Lyft declined to make her available for comment.\n\nThe Trust and Safety team, now based in Nashville, has been around since the app\u2019s launch in 2012 and serves as a layer of protection for riders and drivers using the app, according to the company. It operates a round-the-clock critical response line where workers take reports from riders and drivers on safety violations, escalating many of those to specialists who conduct investigations through interviews and data gathering and undertake other efforts to determine the credibility of complaints.\n\n[Congress wanted to grill Uber and Lyft on safety. The companies blew them off.]\n\nIts safety regimen operates akin to a triage system, where offenses are categorized according to their seriousness: from issues such as hard braking to unwanted comments or sexual harassment to physical violence or sexual assault, according to the employees and documents. Drug and alcohol violations such as possession or an open container are deemed \u201czero-tolerance\u201d offenses.\n\nIn extreme cases, Lyft Trust and Safety specialists banned drivers from the platform as a tool to maintain the safety of the app, even in situations where the credibility of offenses could not necessarily be corroborated but there were multiple allegations demonstrating a pattern of potentially dangerous behavior, the employees familiar with the process said.\n\nThat changed in June. Employees received an email informing them the new Safety Policy and Community Compliance team, would be established to review the most serious complaints about drivers and decide their fate, according to an email reviewed by The Post.\n\n[When rides go wrong: How Uber\u2019s investigations unit works to limit the company\u2019s liability]\n\nThe team \u201cwas created to provide an improved and more consistent experience for cases that may require a permanent deactivation of a driver,\u201d Lyft said in an internal slide deck.\n\nLyft, in its internal communications, told employees to follow a slide deck listing determining factors for when incident responses should be escalated, saying a lot of \u201cthought and hard work\u201d went into the process. Trust and Safety team members now follow guidelines on a computer screen and elevate potential deactivations to the SPCC team, whose members make a final decision.\n\nLaManna said in the statement that the new team \u201censures consistency and prevents bias when permanently banning drivers from the platform for serious offenses and violations of our Community Guidelines.\u201d She added that the team follows a rigorous process.\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: How a team of less than 100 people manages some of the worst incidents that happen in Uber rides]\n\nIn August, Lyft sent another email to tell its dozens of Trust and Safety employees that they have been switched from salaried positions to hourly status, according to the internal communications.\n\nNow those former specialists, newly branded \u201cassociates,\u201d say a layer of defense has been eroded.\n\nLaManna said that the company has invested in the team and processes, something that has \u201celevated our standards and strengthened Lyft as we strive to keep drivers and riders safe.\u201d\n\nThe changes \u201cmay have unforeseen consequences,\u201d said a former executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re making a judgment call, so you need to make sure that you have people who are able to understand the process look at the data.\u201d\n\nStill, the former executive said, Lyft\u2019s reasoning for instituting the program could be sound.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve set up a program where you\u2019re basically automating some of the manual things that we did,\u201d the person said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re weighing judgments, you\u2019re putting in a more scientific approach. That would allow you to lower costs. You would assume the same fidelity of the program, that\u2019s very feasible.\u201d\n\nNYU\u2019s Galloway said Lyft would ultimately be forced to reconcile with a system that deals with matters in which there are \u201ca million shades of gray.\u201d", "description": "The team entrusted with making decisions on whether to deactivate drivers has had its responsibilities eroded.", "authors": ["Faiz Siddiqui", "San Francisco-Based Tech Reporter Covering Automation", "The Future Of Transportation", "Including Tesla", "Uber", "October At Pm", "Faiz Siddiqui Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Technology Team.
