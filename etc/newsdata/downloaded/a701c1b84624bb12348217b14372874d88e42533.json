All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching.\"\n\nTrump's comparison of the ongoing impeachment investigation to the systemic murdering and torture that thousands of African-Americans faced in the late 19th and early 20th century was immediately decried as highly offensive and racially insensitive.\n\nGraham disputed the idea that the comment was racially insensitive, saying, \"No, I think lynching is being seen as somebody taking the law in their own hands and out to get somebody for no good reason.\"\n\nRead more: Trump calls impeachment inquiry a 'lynching' as cracks emerge in Republican lawmakers' support for him\n\nGraham's colleague Sen. Tim Scott also of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate, also told NBC that \"there's no question that the impeachment process is the closet thing to a political death row trial, so I get his absolute rejection of the process.

James Clyburn, a veteran South Carolina lawmaker and the House Majority Whip, reacted with shock and dismay, saying, \"that is one word no president ought to apply to himself.\"\n\nOther black lawmakers and public figures also denounced the remark:\n\n\u2014Rep Frederica Wilson (@RepWilson) October 22, 2019\n\n\u2014Be A King (@BerniceKing) October 22, 2019\n\nRead more:\n\nLindsey Graham, one of Trump's staunchest GOP allies, called the president a 'handful' and suggested he may support impeachment if new evidence comes out\n\nLindsey Graham got duped by a notorious pair of Russian pranksters pretending to be Turkey's defense minister\n\nTrump's 'red wall' against impeachment is looking less stable after 2 GOP senators said they were wavering", "description": "Graham disputed that the comment was racially insensitive, saying, \"I think lynching is being seen as somebody taking the law in their own hands.\"", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf250ecc4a0a7f4004fa6a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
