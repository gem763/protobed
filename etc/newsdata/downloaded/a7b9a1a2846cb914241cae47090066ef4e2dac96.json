Investors also pored through a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president from earlier this year.\n\nThe closed 162.94 points higher, or 0.6% to 26,970.71. The gained 0.6% to end at 2,984.87 while the climbed 1.1% to 8,077.38.\n\nTech was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500, rallying more than 1% along with consumer services. Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) all closed higher.\n\nTrump told reporters at the United Nations in New York that a U.S.-China deal could come sooner \u201cthan you think.\u201d Both countries have been engaged in trade negotiations since last year. The back and forth between China and the U.S. has sent ripples through global financial markets as investors assess the trade war\u2019s impact on the global economy.\n\nHe later said Japan and the U.S. had reached an initial trade agreement.\n\n\u201cThe trade stuff is just more tangible and has a more direct impact on actual earnings\u201d than what\u2019s going on in Washington, said Craig Birk, chief investment officer at Personal Capital. He noted, however, there is still uncertainty on the trade front. \u201cI think investors have learned they can\u2019t predict where the trade war goes.It\u2019s driven by two unpredictable leaders. As the conflict goes longer, the market has grown comfortable with the status quo, but there is potential for either positive or negative developments.\u201d\n\nThe market also rebounded after a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released by the White House. It showed Trump asked Zelensky if he could \u201clook into\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, what Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Trump said on the call. The call is believed to be part of an intelligence community whistleblower complaint Democrats have asked the administration to release. They say the complaint would hold details not available in the call\u2019s transcript.\n\nThe market may have taken some comfort in the fact that the memo does not appear to show an explicit quid pro quo by the president, but more details have yet to come out. Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is set to testify in front of Congress Thursday at 9 a.m. ET.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more to learn,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cThis is going to be news that spills out over time but I can\u2019t imaging the start of this process improves the tone of the U.S.-China trade talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m China, I feel empowered,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nThe so-called transcript was released after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday she will launch a formal impeachment inquiry on Trump.\n\nNews about Pelosi\u2019s announcement sent stocks lower in the previous session. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest one-day declines in a month. The also dropped 142 points, or 0.5%.\n\nThis all \u201ccame at an unfortunate point when everyone was positioned long hoping the trade war was going to be OK,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital. However, Feygin thinks the market should rebound since impeachment is unlikely to pass the Republican-led Senate.\n\nStocks have surged since Trump was elected as the administration has implemented policies such as tax cuts and decreased regulation. The has surged more than 46% since Trump\u2019s election. Stocks have previously struggled when a president faces the possibility of impeachment.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down about 20% at one point from its high in 1998 as independent counsel Kenneth Starr ramped up his investigation of President Bill Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice, according to CFRA. The market bottomed as the House began impeachment proceedings and later recovered all losses to reach a then-record high.\n\nWashington policy analyst Chris Krueger said in a note that his \u201cbase case\u201d scenario is \u201cthe House impeaches Trump, though the Senate does not convict, e.g. Bill Clinton 2.0.\u201d\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Ed Moya) covering: S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Alphabet Inc Class A, Amazon.com Inc.
