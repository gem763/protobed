(SANA Handout/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nForces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took up positions Monday in several key towns across northeastern Syria, state media and war monitoring group reported, following a last-minute agreement with local Kurdish fighters to ward off a Turkish offensive.\n\nSyrian troops reportedly arrived in Ain Issa and Tabqa \u2014 on the outskirts of Raqqa \u2014 and raised the Syrian flag over government buildings in major cities such as Qamishli and Hasakeh, according to pro-government media. One report, in al-Watan newspaper, said government forces had reached the towns of Kobane, a garrison for Syrian Kurdish militants, and Manbij, where U.S. troops had been stationed.\n\nThe return of Assad\u2019s forces to northeastern Syria marks a stunning reversal for Syrian Kurdish authorities, whose fighters controlled a wide swath of territory and enjoyed U.S. support in their battle against the Islamic State.\n\nTurkey views the Syrian Kurdish militias as terrorists and launched its offensive against the fighters \u2014 known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF \u2014 last week. The operation has helped unravel the U.S. mission in northern Syria, prompting President Trump to order the withdrawal of all U.S. troops in the coming weeks.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted Monday at a broadening of the Turkish offensive, saying Turkey was \u201cin the process of implementing our decision on the subject of Manbij,\u201d a Syrian town about 25 miles west of the Euphrates River. Turkey had long demanded that the United States expel Kurdish fighters from the town and complained that a deal struck with Washington to remove the fighters was not being implemented.\n\nIt was not clear whether Erdogan was suggesting that an offensive on the town was imminent, amid reports that Syrian government troops were also headed to Manbij. \u201cWhen Manbij is evacuated, the real owners will enter there,\u201d he said, referring to Syrian Arabs.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of Islamic State family members escaped a detention camp after Turkish shellfire hit the area. U.S. troops pulled out from another base, and Turkish-backed forces consolidated their hold over a vital highway, cutting the main U.S. supply route into Syria.\n\nThe announcement by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that they had reached an agreement with Assad\u2019s Iranian- and Russian-backed government further undermined the prospect of any continued U.S. presence in the country. The deal will bring forces loyal to Assad back into towns and cities that have been under Kurdish control for seven years.\n\n\u201cAn agreement has been reached with the Syrian government \u2014 whose duty it is to protect the country\u2019s borders and preserve Syrian sovereignty \u2014 for the Syrian army to enter and deploy along the Syrian-Turkish border to help the SDF stop this aggression\u201d by Turkey, the SDF said in a statement.\n\nU.S. officials declined to confirm local media reports that troops had pulled out of the towns of Manbij and Kobane, where local officials confirmed they had agreed to allow Syrian troops to deploy.\n\nWitnesses said celebratory gunfire erupted in parts of the town of Qamishli as Syrian troop reinforcements flew into the local airport, according to a Kurdish security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of safety concerns. He said local Kurdish forces had been ordered not to confront Syrian troops, who arrived to bolster a small contingent of government forces that had remained in the city after Kurdish forces took it over in 2012.\n\n[Turkish-led forces film themselves executing a Kurdish captive in Syria]\n\nThe deal followed three days of negotiations brokered by Russia between the Syrian government and the SDF, which had reached the conclusion that it could no longer count on the United States, its chief ally for the past five years in the fight against the Islamic State, according to a Kurdish intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.\n\nEvents earlier in the day highlighted the rapid deterioration of both the SDF\u2019s and the United States\u2019 ability to contain swifter-than-expected Turkish advances deep into Syrian territory.\n\nAs Turkish-backed Syrian rebels approached the town of Ain Issa, 20 miles from the Turkish border, hundreds of Islamic State family members escaped from a camp housing displaced people, taking advantage of the mayhem that ensued as Turkish artillery pounded the area.\n\n\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian rebels drive on a street in the Turkish border town of Akcakale in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, Oct. 14, 2019. (Stoyan Nenov/Reuters)\n\nThe Kurdish administration in northeastern Syria said 785 people affiliated with the Islamic State escaped from a camp that had housed 12,000 displaced people, mostly women and children.\n\nAbout 1,000 of those, almost all foreigners, had been identified as Islamic State supporters and had been housed in a separate section of the camp known as the Annex. That section is now \u201ccompletely empty,\u201d according to an aid worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the news media.\n\nThe claim that the Islamic State-linked families had escaped could not be independently confirmed. But Kurdish officials and aid groups said thousands of civilians were also leaving, fleeing across fields to escape the shelling. The U.S. military told aid workers to evacuate.\n\nAin Issa, which was the headquarters of the Kurdish-led administration in northeastern Syria, owes its significance to its position beside the M4 highway, which runs from the Iraqi border across northeastern Syria. It is the main supply route in and out of Syria for the 1,000 U.S. troops deployed there and for much of the limited aid that reaches northeastern Syria.\n\nAs the Turkish-backed Syrian rebels closed in on Sunday, the small number of U.S. troops based in the town were relocated to other bases in Syria, said a U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.\n\nTurkish-backed rebels have set up checkpoints on the highway near Ain Issa, cutting off U.S. troops in bases to the west, in Manbij and Kobane. Those troops came under Turkish artillery fire Friday night in what some U.S. soldiers suspect was a deliberate attempt to drive them away from the bulk of the U.S. forces farther east, Kurdish and U.S. officials said.\n\nThere were conflicting reports from Washington on whether Trump intends to order the withdrawal of all 1,000 of the U.S. troops imminently or simply to relocate those closest to the front lines to safer positions.\n\nBut with their supply lines severed, the region in disarray and their Kurdish allies focused on fighting Turkey and not the Islamic State, the U.S. troop presence in northeastern Syria is becoming increasingly untenable, the U.S. official said.\n\n[In Syria, U.S. pullout and Turkish assault sparks exodus to anywhere that feels safe ]\n\nResidents of northeastern Syria said they were stunned by the speed with which SDF defenses appeared to be collapsing, along with the U.S. commitment to remain in the area alongside allies in the five-year fight against the Islamic State, Kurdish officials said.\n\nIt represents a gamble for the Kurds, who appeared to have secured no guarantees for the survival of the autonomy they have gained over the area over the past seven years. Badran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, said the Kurds felt they had no choice but to turn to Damascus in light of what he called the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the United States. \u201cThis has obliged us to look for alternative options,\u201d he said.\n\nA Syrian government announcement that Syrian troops were heading to the area to assume control from the SDF and confront the Turks raised hopes that an end to the chaos was in sight, according to a Kurdish woman who fled her home near the front lines three days ago and has taken refuge in Qamishli.\n\n\u201cFor the regime to intervene and deploy its forces on the Turkish border is a comforting thought,\u201d said the woman, who gave her name as Nowruz. \u201cIf a deal with the regime is what it takes to stop these massacres, then so be it. At the end of the day, we are all Syrians, and the regime is Syrian, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Americans betrayed us. We do not trust them anymore,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nA handout photo made available by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) shows civilians welcoming Syrian army soldiers arriving at Tal Tamr town, in northwestern Hasakah province, Syria, Oct. 14, 2019.

The Kurdish administration said all deliveries of food and medical aid have been suspended. There were indications that some agencies have started withdrawing their staff.\n\nA United Nations official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues said that half of the aid workers in the areas held by the SDF have evacuated, and others are expected to follow.\n\nA Turkish airstrike against a convoy of vehicles carrying civilians and journalists killed at least nine people, illustrating the dangers confronting those who remain in the area, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group.\n\nThe convoy was approaching the town of Ras al-Ayn, one of the first two border towns targeted by the Turkish invasion, when a warplane struck. Videos of the aftermath showed body parts scattered across a wide area and horrific wounds suffered by some of the survivors.\n\nAin Issa is the third town from which U.S. troops have withdrawn since Trump announced that the United States would not stand in the way of a Turkish invasion aimed at pushing Kurdish-led forces away from the border. About 50 troops withdrew last week from the border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, which were the first targets of the Turkish advance.\n\nTurkey regards the Syrian Kurdish fighters that lead the Syrian Democratic Forces as a terrorist organization because of their affiliation with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, which has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish government for decades. But Turkey\u2019s offensive has drawn almost no international support, leaving the country isolated as it presses ahead with the campaign.\n\nErdogan, speaking in Istanbul on Sunday, rejected foreign criticism of the Turkish offensive, as well as calls from Britain and other countries to negotiate with the Syrian Kurds to end the conflict.\n\n\u201cHow can you recommend sitting down at the same table with terrorists?\u201d the Turkish president asked.\n\nHe said the operation would continue until the Kurdish-led force is driven back from Turkey\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cWe are not fighting against the Kurds,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cWe are not targeting Kurdish citizens.\u201d\n\nHe gave no indication that the operation would end soon. Turkish forces would press 19 miles into Syria, he said, and \u201cuntil they leave the space, we will continue the operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not let a terrorist state be established in northeast Syria.\u201d\n\nDadouch reported from Beirut.\n\nRead more\n\nEuropeans warn of security peril from Turkey\u2019s assault on Kurds in Syria\n\nU.
