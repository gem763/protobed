Oil prices recover some ground, but economic concerns weigh\n\n* U.S. manufacturing activity contracted in August - data\n\n* Trumps warns he would be tougher on Beijing if trade talks\n\n* China's services sector activity picks up pace - survey\n\nBy Jessica Jaganathan and Florence Tan\n\nSINGAPORE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices recovered some\n\nground on Wednesday after touching their lowest in close to a\n\nmonth during the previous session on concerns that a weakening\n\nglobal economy could depress demand.\n\nBrent crude was up 12 cents, or 0.21%, at $58.38 a\n\nbarrel by 0425 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures\n\ngained 20 cents, or 0.37%, at $54.14 at barrel.\n\nOil prices sunk to a nearly one-month low on Tuesday\n\nfollowing data that showed U.S. manufacturing activity in August\n\ncontracted for the first time in three years and euro zone\n\nmanufacturing activity contracted for a seventh month in August.\n\nBut global markets bounced on Wednesday after a private\n\nsurvey showed that activity in China's services sector expanded\n\nat the fastest pace in three months in August as new orders\n\nrose, prompting the biggest increase in hiring in over a year.\n\nChina is the world's second-largest oil consumer and largest\n\nimporter.\n\n\"Given the tumble that we saw overnight it's probably people\n\nlocking in gains on shorts or perhaps establishing new longs in\n\nanticipation we might get an announcement from Beijing (on\n\nsetting a date for trade talks with the United States),\" said\n\nMichael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in\n\nSydney.\n\nA short position is when an investor sells futures in\n\nexpectations of falling prices while a long position is when one\n\nbuys futures to profit from rising prices.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned he would be\n\n\"tougher\" on Beijing in a second term if trade talks dragged on,\n\ncompounding market fears that ongoing trade disputes between the\n\nUnited States and China could trigger a U.S. recession.\n\n\"Market participants are becoming increasingly worried about\n\nrecession risk,\" said Stephen Innes, a market strategist at\n\nAxiTrader.\n\n\"Moreover, given that tariffs present a significant threat\n\nto U.S. growth and in turn, the health of the global economy,\n\noil prices will remain under pressure especially if trade and\n\ntariff war shows no sign of abating.\"\n\nData due this week on U.S. inventory levels will be delayed\n\nby a day to Wednesday and Thursday because of the U.S. Labour\n\nDay holiday on Monday.\n\nU.S. crude oil stockpiles likely declined for a third\n\nstraight week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.\n\nEIA/S\n\nOn the supply side, Venezuela's oil exports fell in August\n\nto their lowest level in 2019, internal reports and Refinitiv\n\nEikon data showed, following tougher U.S. sanctions.", "description": "Oil prices recover some ground, but economic concerns weigh", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEBBT0BW_L.jpg"}
