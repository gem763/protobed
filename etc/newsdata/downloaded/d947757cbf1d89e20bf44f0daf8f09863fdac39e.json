(AP) - After a few frustrating weeks, Washington State coach Mike Leach was pleased to see the Cougars play with a level of consistency that has been absent.\n\n\u201cConsistency and the mental tough ness to stay focused from one play to the next,\u201d Leach said. \u201cEveryone wants to get ahead of themselves but all you have is that one play in the present moment and you better focus on that one and I thought we did a better job of keeping track of that tonight.\u201d\n\nAnthony Gordon passed for 369 yards and four touchdowns and Washington State rolled over Colorado 41-10 on Saturday, snapping the Cougars\u2019 three-game losing streak.\n\nGordon threw a 4-yard TD pass to Max Borghi and a 22-yarder to Dezmon Patmon in the first quarter as the Cougars (4-3, 1-3 Pac-12) jumped to a 14-0 lead, scored touchdowns on their first three drives and cruised to a needed victory. Gordon was 35-of-51 passing and connected with eight different receivers.\n\nThe WSU defense was excellent after weeks of getting of getting shredded. Colorado was limited to 320 total yards and quarterback Steven Montez was intercepted twice.\n\n\u201cI think we are emerging defensively,\u201d Leach said. \u201cWe simplified some things but we are still kind of coming together there a little bit, honestly. I think the defense has some of its best football ahead of us.\u201d\n\nBorghi was also outstanding on the ground, rushing for 105 yards, including a 47-yard touchdown run late in the first quarter that gave the Cougars a 21-3 lead.\n\nMontez was 16-of-30 passing for 129 yards. Alex Fontenot had 11 carries for 105 yards, but the Buffaloes\u2019 only touchdown came on Laviska Shenault Jr.\u2019s 6-yard TD run in the third quarter that pulled Colorado (3-4, 1-3) within 24-10.\n\nBut Gordon responded with a 44-yard TD pass to Brandon Arconado and hit Tay Martin for a 1-yard TD early in the fourth quarter.\n\nColorado Coach Mel Tucker was frustrated with turnovers and the inability to finish drives.\n\n\u201cWe need to be able to score touchdowns, especially against a team like this who can move the ball and score,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cThat has been an issue for us the past couple of weeks. Obviously, we are moving the ball but we can\u2019t finish drives and we missed a couple field goals. Those are thing that we have to get cleaned up.\u201d\n\nTURNOVERS\n\nWashington State recorded three takeaways, improving to 28-5 since 2015 when forcing multiple turnovers. It was the first time the Cougars intercepted three passes in a game since its win over Eastern Washington last season.\n\nGROUND GAME\n\nBorghi posted his third 100-yard rushing game of the season. Borghi is the first Cougar with three 100-yard games in a season since Jerome Harrison had eight in 2005. Borghi also had nine catches, tying a career-high.\n\nROUGH DEBUT\n\nMontez was replaced in the fourth quarter by Tyler Lytle, but he was injured on his first play. Freshman Blake Stenstrom stepped in for the first action of his career and his first pass attempt was intercepted.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes lost their third straight and could not get off the field on third downs, continuing a season-long issue. Washington State converted 7-of-14 third downs. The Buffaloes were giving up 49% on third down entering the game.\n\nWashington State: The Cougars were giving up 47.7 points per game in conference play, but didn\u2019t allow Colorado out of its own territory on seven of its final nine drives. The Buffaloes have five drives of three plays or less.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes host Southern California on Friday.\n\nWashington State: The Cougars travel to No. 12 Oregon next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After a few frustrating weeks, Washington State coach Mike Leach was pleased to see the Cougars play with a level of consistency that has been absent.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/colorado_washington_st_football_29322_c0-172-4135-2584_s1200x700.jpg?c2fb6e4e7de07a57c24ee3398419b5b27682d852", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
