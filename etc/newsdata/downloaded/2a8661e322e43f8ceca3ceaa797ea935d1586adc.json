He also rushed for 104 yards and two scores. In 2018, he completed 162 of 300 attempts for 1,960 yards and eight touchdowns but threw 12 interceptions.\n\nPass had practiced on a limited basis and had been listed as day-to-day after the recurring injury. He has already used up his redshirt year.\n\nThe Cardinals have been splitting QB duties between sophomore Micale Cunningham and freshman Evan Conley. Cunningham, who is 3-1 as a starter since Pass has been out, has completed 44 of 66 attempts for 816 yards and seven touchdowns with one interception. He was injured during the past two games, including Saturday against Wake Forest, but was able to return.\n\nWhile subbing for Cunningham, Conley has completed 24 of 37 attempts for 422 yards and four touchdowns with one interception.\n\n\"We will play the guy who is most healthiest, that's been the biggest question,\" Satterfield said. \"I hate injuries, but that's part of the game. Whoever is the most healthiest guy will play.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Louisville junior quarterback Jawon Pass will undergo surgery on his right toe  Wednesday and miss the rest of the season, coach Scott Satterfield announced ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
