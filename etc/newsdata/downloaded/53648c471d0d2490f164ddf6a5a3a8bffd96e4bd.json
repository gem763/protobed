Just yesterday, the U.S. Air Force came under scrutiny for overnight stays at a Trump hotel in Scotland while refuelling. And Trump himself recently proposed hosting the next G-7 summit at his hotel in Doral, Florida.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of hotels all over the place and people use them because they\u2019re the best,\u201d Trump said in response to questions about Pence\u2019s recent stay.\n\nCases like these have now opened up a larger investigation by U.S. Democrats into Trump personally profiting from his presidency by using his office to steer customers towards his businesses.\n\nAccording to a New York Times story published over the weekend, Trump properties have hosted thousands of visits by foreign leaders, Republican members of Congress, lobbyists and political candidates, among others. As determined in an analysis by the Centre for Responsive Politics, they\u2019ve spent just under $28 million on use of Trump properties, most of which came after Trump already became president.\n\nBut is there any underlying rule that would stop an American president from profiting during their time in office? And what are U.S. Congressional Democrats doing to stop it?\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem?\n\nAs the Times writes, since Trump became president, spending by foreign leaders, lobbyists, and other Republican leaders at Trump properties has grown immensely; one consumer advocacy group, Public Citizen, estimates that political candidates and party organisations alone have spent at least $8 million on Trump properties since January 2017, as compared to just $173,440 in the four years before his run for presidency.\n\nMuch of the controversy is directed at spending by foreign parties. In an obscure set of provisions under the U.S. Constitution, known as the Emoluments Clause, a sitting U.S. president cannot accept any \u201cpresent\u201d from any foreign party, like, say, payment in the form of leaders booking out several hotel rooms or hosting a convention at Trump properties.\n\nAlso, the Emoluments Clause does not allow the American president to accept more or less than his salary, including from federal or state governments, which brings up serious issues like Pence\u2019s stay in Ireland (paid for by U.S. tax-dollars, which were then funnelled directly into the pockets of the Trump Organisation).\n\nIt is not technically illegal, however, for a U.S. president to continue to run a business while serving, and in the past, presidents have acted on an honour system of sorts (or a \u201cblind trust\u201d; a president gives up the ability to act on or manage their own trust in an effort to avoid any conflict of interest). Trump has not adhered to this honour system.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gotten at least a million dollars a year from foreign governments staying at his properties,\u201d Washington Post reporter, David Fahrenthold, told NPR. \u201cAnd the mechanism to enforce that turns out to be the federal courts, which have moved very, very slowly as they try to sort of process this whole new area of law that they really hadn\u2019t dealt with before. The practical effect is that Trump gets away with it.\u201d\n\nOf course, this is separate but very much related to Trump\u2019s own spending when staying at his properties. But at the moment, and without public tax returns, we don\u2019t really know how much he\u2019s spending American taxpayers\u2019 money to enrich his own businesses.\n\nPhoto: Charles McQuillan, Getty Images\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThree lawsuits have been filed against Trump that invoke the Emoluments Clause; two have been dropped and one by Congressional Democrats remains active.\n\nSpurred by Pence\u2019s stay and the proposed location of the G-7 summit, however, U.S. Democrats said they are now investigating both cases as violations of the clause.\n\n\u201cThe committee does not believe that U.S. taxpayer funds should be used to personally enrich President Trump, his family, and his companies,\u201d Elijah E. Cummings, chairman of the Oversight and House Reform Committee wrote in a letter to the White House. Meanwhile, in a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has referred to Trump properties as a \u201ccesspool of corruption.\u201d\n\nIf you want to take a deeper dive into spending by U.S. Republican committees at Trump properties, OpenSecrets, is tracking many of these payments; they also have an extensive list of foreign leaders who have business ties with Trump and his properties.", "description": "Last week, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visited Dublin, Ireland to attend several meetings \u2014 but confusingly, stayed at a Trump hotel nearly 320 kilometres away.
