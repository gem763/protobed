Much as the banks are protecting themselves, customers holding large deposits are expected to be keen to prevent their cash from being eaten away in such a topsy-turvy environment.", "description": "Banks and their biggest customers are checking the fine print of loan agreements for clauses that place a floor on interest rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9314%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_740%2C$y_305/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/97e1de10953039a8bbdf86797d06288dd221dbe0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
