His fund then pushes the companies to change in order to drive up their stock prices.\n\nTrump, realizing Elliott\u2019s influence, sent an indirect message to the fund on Twitter, calling the investment \u201cgreat news\u201d and speculating that \u201cperhaps [AT&T] will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible \u2018anchors.\u2019\u201d\n\nFurthering his criticism, the president claimed that CNN\u2019s ratings are costing it \u201ca fortune\u201d and that its \u201cInternational Division spews bad information & Fake News all over the globe.\u201d He again claimed that foreign leaders question why the media doesn\u2019t cover him more favorably.\n\n\u201cIt is a fraudulent shame, & all comes from the top,\u201d he declared.\n\n...But most importantly, @CNN is bad for the USA. Their International Division spews bad information & Fake News all over the globe. This is why foreign leaders are always asking me, \u201cWhy does the Media hate the U.S. sooo much?\u201d It is a fraudulent shame, & all comes from the top! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nAT&T did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on the president\u2019s tweets.\n\nTrump long opposed AT&T\u2019s $85 billion buyout of Time Warner, making his stance clear on the 2016 campaign trail and raising questions over whether his position was motivated by his disdain for CNN.\n\nIn 2017, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block the acquisition, which Time Warner felt was essential for it to stay afloat in a media ecosystem dominated by tech behemoths like Facebook and Google. However, a federal judge approved the merger last year.\n\nAs part of its announcement Monday, Elliott said its investment in AT&T is \u201camong its largest ever.\u201d In a letter to the board of the telecom giant, the fund predicted that by the end of 2021, it could raise AT&T\u2019s share values by $60 each \u2015 a 65% increase.", "description": "The president is suggesting that Elliott Management -- led by GOP megadonor Paul Singer -- violate press freedom at CNN.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d76ba6c230000e90351297a.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
