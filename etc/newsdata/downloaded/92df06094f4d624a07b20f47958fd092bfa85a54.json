Eight-year-old loses her life\n\nBCCL\n\nIn April this year, massive rescue operations were conducted to safely rescue an eight-year-old girl in Farrukhabad but it had to be called off. The reason? Officials found themselves in quite a situation as the rescue operation was resulting in cracks in the surrounding houses. As per reports, at least six nearby houses had developed cracks and there were risks of further damage if digging was not stopped. The girl had fallen into a 60-foot borewell and its darkness became the last sight she ever saw.\n\n2.

It was located just outside her house in Nagapattinam and the incident had occurred while she was playing. When family members could not find her, they began looking and ultimately found her trapped in the borewell. Although she was later saved, a lot of time was lost as the concerned authorities themselves were reportedly clueless on how to rescue the girl.\n\n3. Dead body of four-year-old recovered\n\nAn agriculture borewell in Chinnayanakanahalli village in Srirangapatna taluk is overflowing without running motor pump and people are thronging the place to get glimpse of this astounding sight.

She fell into the borewell - covered with a polythene sack - when she stepped on it accidentally while playing. After a 19-hour long struggle, she was rescued alive by multiple teams working in tandem, but later died in a hospital.\n\n5. 20 Killed in Massive Blaze at Coaching Centre in Surat\n\nAnd wait, borewells are not the only reason. At least 20 students were killed and several injured after a major fire broke out at a coaching centre in Sarthana area of Surat in May this year. Disturbing visuals showed some students jumping off the multi-storey building in an attempt to escape the inferno.\n\nAGENCIES\n\nThe students were attending tuition classes when the fire broke out at the Takshila building. Officials said at least 10 students on the third and fourth floors jumped to the ground to save themselves from the fire and smoke.\n\nA fire safety audit of the school was ordered later but even the rescue operation did not involve the modern tools and techniques that could have otherwise been applied to prevent its occurrence.\n\n6. 110 hours of rescue operation but to no avail\n\nPrivate tanker is being filled water from a borewell on Poonamallee Bypass Road near Senneerkuppam in Chennai.
