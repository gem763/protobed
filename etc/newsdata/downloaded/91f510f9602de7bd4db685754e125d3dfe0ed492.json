Silence Is Golden", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow @Brexit, sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, and tell us your Brexit story.\n\nIf Boris Johnson can manage to produce a Brexit deal in the next fortnight, can he get Parliament to vote for it? From the U.K. prime minister\u2019s point of view, the lack of noise is probably a good thing.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s negotiations with the European Union were conducted against a soundtrack of angry warnings from members of Parliament in her Conservative Party. She\u2019d better not sell them out, they said, and even before she had a deal, many of them were committed to voting against it -- Johnson included.\n\nBut on Friday there were no warning shots fired on the news channels, no delegations walking up Downing Street to lay down the law with the prime minister. For the toughest Conservative Brexiteers, the calculation has changed.\n\nThere are 28 Conservative MPs who have so far refused to vote for any Brexit deal. In March, when others, including Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, gave way and backed May\u2019s agreement, they refused to give in. They named themselves the \u201cSpartans,\u201d after the Greek warriors who fought the Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.\n\nUntil a month ago, the Spartans were content to promise to vote against any Brexit deal they didn\u2019t like, believing the alternative would be to leave the EU without any deal at all on Oct. 31 -- an outcome some of them actively want. The passage of a law intended to stop a no-deal Brexit -- known as the Benn Act -- has made them wonder whether that\u2019s still realistic.\n\nExtension Threat\n\nInstead of leaving the EU this month, they fear the U.K. will be forced to seek a further extension to talks. That could see them fighting an election where Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party splits the Conservative vote and them losing power altogether, leading to another Brexit referendum.\n\nBluntly, the question for the Spartans is whether a Brexit they don\u2019t like is better than no Brexit at all.\n\nThe same question applies to Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, who along with the Spartans refused to back May. They too were staying quiet. Johnson had spoken to DUP leader Arlene Foster and his office was keeping the party informed.\n\nFoster issued a noncommittal statement Friday afternoon, though made clear the party hadn\u2019t made up its mind. If Johnson can keep them on board, the support of most of the Spartans will be secure.\n\nInvisible Border\n\nThe DUP\u2019s choice is complicated because a no-deal Brexit would harm their voters, many of whom have got used to doing business across Ireland\u2019s invisible border. Though the party has opposed anything that might create a boundary in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K., they were ready to bend that principle when Johnson asked them at the start of the month.\n\nBut even if the DUP ultimately denounces the deal, the Spartan wobble could mean they find themselves lonelier than they were in March. That too could affect their thinking. If Johnson managed to pass a deal without them, the limits of their influence would be exposed.\n\nAlso crucial to Johnson\u2019s chances are the Labour Party. Around 30 Labour MPs have in the past been willing to sign letters urging a Brexit deal, but far fewer have ever voted for one. This month, though, 19 signed a letter urging the EU to work with Johnson. That might indicate a willingness to actually vote with him.\n\nIf Johnson could line up the Spartans, the DUP and more than a handful of Labour MPs, he would have a chance of getting his deal through.\n\nMany of the 22 MPs who left the Conservatives last month would be ready to vote for a deal, though not all. If it\u2019s a deal that they think would result in a distant relationship with the EU, their support isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\nIt\u2019s far from a certainty. Much depends on what the actual agreement, if there is one, looks like. But for Johnson, for now, the silence is golden.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Thomas Penny, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Follow\u00a0@Brexit,\u00a0sign up\u00a0to our Brexit Bulletin, and\u00a0tell us your Brexit story.\u00a0If Boris Johnson can manage to produce a Brexit deal in the next fortnight, can he get Parliament to vote for it?
