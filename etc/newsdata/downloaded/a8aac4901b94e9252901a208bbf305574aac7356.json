Trump has imposed tariffs on a number of goods imported from China that are difficult to obtain from other markets, while in return China has stopped importing U.S. agricultural products.\n\nOn Monday, China announced its desire for additional negotiations regarding a trade agreement with the U.S. before a final commitment. The deal purportedly includes $40 to $50 billion in Chinese purchases of American agricultural products, as well as protections on American intellectual property.", "description": "U.S. retail sales declined for the first time in seven months in September, sparking fears of an economic slowdown.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
