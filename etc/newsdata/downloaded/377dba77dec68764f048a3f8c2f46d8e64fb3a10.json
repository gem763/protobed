What\u2019s at stake is who gets what job.\n\nThe two parties in the ongoing coalition talks have spent much of the last decade tearing each other down. For the anti-establishment 5Star Movement, the Democratic Party epitomized the ancien r\u00e9gime, synonymous for its voters with corruption and nepotism. For the Democrats, the 5Stars, with their calls for direct democracy and cyber populism, represented a vulgar challenge to representative democracy.\n\nThe logic of political appointments is key to keep the machine of consensus well-oiled in a complex society.\n\nToday, the two parties are debating over which is best suited to provide the new defense minister \u2014 the 5Stars announced Tuesday that it had secured members\u2019 approval for a new coalition.\n\nUnlikely bedfellows divvying up the plum jobs is hardly a new phenomenon in Italy, the birthplace of political realism, from Machiavelli onward. Italians know that politics is, at all levels, a distributive activity.\n\nYou keep people loyal by throwing them buns. The logic of political appointments is key to keep the machine of consensus well-oiled in a complex society.\n\nThe new Italian executive being formed under the renewed leadership of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is expected to appoint some 400 people to board positions in different bodies, ranging from independent authorities to state-controlled businesses. Political parties and related interest groups are naturally hungry to grab as many of these as possible for themselves.\n\nBut if politics in Italy seems particularly messy this time around it\u2019s because of a recent change in the electoral law \u2014 one that restored elements of the nearly pure proportional system that was in place from the end of World War II until 1992.\n\nIt\u2019s a system that worked arguably well until the early 1960s, as Italy moved from a backward, agricultural country to an industrial powerhouse. But after an initial grace period, its dominant characteristic was an extreme form of political bargaining.\n\nPost-war governments were famously short-lived: they lasted, on average, eight months. The old joke was: You go to London to see the changing of the guard; you go to Rome to see the changing of the government.\n\nWhy did governments change so quickly? Not because of great ideological disputes or passionate debates over public policies. They fell because they relied on the support of complex mosaics of political parties and relevant supporting interests, all of which had to be rewarded to remain part of the coalition.\n\nIn Italy, governments are chosen by the parliament, not directly elected by voters. That allows the various political forces in the two chambers to swap out the executive \u2014 and redistribute the goodies \u2014 without giving up their own jobs. And indeed, while the lifespan of governments was short, parliaments often survived for close to their full terms.\n\nThings changed in 1992, when Italy moved to a new way of electing parliaments, with some elements resembling the British first-past-the-post system. This allowed a flamboyant politician like Silvio Berlusconi to move the country closer to a majoritarian system, in which Italians felt they were voting for a government leader of their choosing. Italian politics remained exciting. But the system was arguably more stable, with Berlusconi in particular dominating the political stage.\n\nThe present parliament is the product of yet another electoral system. The 2018 vote took place under mixed system, in which 37 percent of seats were allocated using a first-past-the-post electoral system and most of the rest using a proportional method.\n\nDecisive reforms were usually postponed, as they did not immediately translate into benefits for the members of the ruling coalition.\n\nThe result is the instability we see today. A proportional system, today\u2019s political upheaval reminds us, gives less power to voters and more to party leaders and allows parliamentary tacticians to trump over electoral stars.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party who sparked the crisis, is learning to his detriment.\n\nAfter ruling for a little more than a year in an uncomfortable coalition with the 5Stars, Salvini pulled the plug on the government in early August.\n\nIt\u2019s likely he thought he was being a smart political strategist. Support for the League has soared during Salvini\u2019s time in government, and polls suggested he would likely be able to rule alone, or with the support of the even-further-right Brothers of Italy party.\n\nA polarizing figure of the type that could do well in a majoritarian system, Salvini was aiming for an electoral campaign in which he \u2014 like Berlusconi before him \u2014 would be both a contender and the main topic of debate.\n\nHe didn\u2019t count on the the 5Stars turning instead to their erstwhile arch-foe, the Democratic Party, as a way to preserve their jobs and divvy up the spoils.\n\nITALY NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nFrom the point of view of public finances and foreign policy, Conte\u2019s new government may be a lesser evil than one led by a Salvini strengthened by an electoral triumph. Indeed, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has compared Conte with Greek former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who campaigned as a radical but governed as a moderate.\n\nBut the reemergence of political bargaining as the chief driver of Italian politics is not without serious costs.\n\nThe extreme political bargaining Italy saw in the 1970s and 1980s was good at keeping political parties happy, but it almost invariably meant increasing spending.\n\nDecisive reforms were usually postponed, as they did not immediately translate into benefits for the members of the ruling coalition. Short-lived governments had an even tighter time horizon than politicians typically have.\n\nThat worked okay at a time when nobody much cared about growing of public debt, when Italy was free to devalue its currency to remain competitive, and before globalization compounded the costs of dysfunctional institutions.\n\nBut can it work at all in our time?\n\nAlberto Mingardi is director general of Istituto Bruno Leoni in Milan, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and a presidential fellow at Chapman University.", "description": "The state of Italian politics right now isn\u2019t just the result of the ambition and fecklessness of individual politicians.", "authors": ["Alberto Mingardi", "Hanne Cokelaere", "Jacopo Barigazzi", "Stephen Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1162875399-1200x628.jpg"}
