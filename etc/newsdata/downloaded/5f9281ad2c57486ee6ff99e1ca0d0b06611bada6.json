For the year to March 2019, rough calculations indicate the pair pocketed almost another \u00a320m just months before their business imploded.\n\nCashing in: Neil Woodford's troubles began in earnest in June, when, after two years of poor performance, he ran out of ready cash to return to investors\n\nTwo thirds of this will have gone to Woodford, 59, in line with his ownership stake in the firm, meaning he will have paid himself close to \u00a313m.\n\nJustin Modray, of Candid Financial Advice, said: 'News of another bumper dividend for Woodford and Newman will add to the significant scorn I imagine investors in Woodford funds already have for the pair.'\n\nWoodford's troubles began in earnest in June, when, after two years of poor performance, he ran out of ready cash to return to investors who were exiting his flagship Equity Income fund.\n\nHe was forced to freeze investors' money in the fund to give him time to sell some of the assets and raise cash. But after four months of suspension, Link Fund Solutions \u2013 which oversees the management of the fund \u2013 pulled the plug. It fired Woodford earlier this month, and appointed managers to sell all the assets and return the money to investors. Hours later, Woodford quit from the Income Focus fund and Patient Capital Trust and announced he would shut down his investment empire.\n\nThe Woodford saga is causing problems for other fund managers, as administrators like Link worry that they could be penalised if funds they oversee run out of cash like Woodford Equity Income.\n\nSeveral fund managers have been told by their administrators that their funds could be suspended unless they make efforts to reduce their exposure to difficult-to-sell assets so investors can get their money back easily.\n\nINVESTORS PULL CASH FROM INVESCO The UK business of funds house Invesco, where Neil Woodford made his name, has seen its worst monthly outflows in six years. Investors pulled \u00a3967m from the firm's UK fund range in September, according to data from Morningstar, as the fallout from Woodford's collapse battered investor confidence. It was the worst month on record for Invesco's UK funds since Woodford announced he was leaving the company in 2013. Since he left Invesco to set up shop alone, savers have pulled \u00a315.4 billion more from the firm's UK funds than they have put in. More than \u00a38 billion of that has been scooped out over the last 12 months. Mark Barnett, Woodford's protege, took over the management of Invesco's two most popular UK funds in 2014. Investors in the Invesco High Income fund have lost 4.4 per cent of their money over the past three years, while those in the Invesco Income fund will have lost 3.5 per cent.\n\nIncluding the most recent dividend, Woodford alone has pocketed around \u00a376m since setting up. Investors who put \u00a310,000 into his Equity Income fund when it launched in 2014 would be sitting on just \u00a38,480. Savers who put the same amount into his Income Focus fund when it was set up in 2017 would have an even measlier \u00a37,410. And anyone who bought \u00a310,000 of shares in the Woodford Patient Capital Trust when it launched in 2015 would be holding stock worth just \u00a33,620.\n\nLuke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, said: 'It shouldn't be possible for directors to profit so lavishly from such disastrous performance.'\n\nThe dividend calculations, by the Financial Times, assume that Woodford charged an average fee of 0.5 per cent on the \u00a312 billion of assets his firm had under management during the year to March 2019.\n\nA spokesman for the company confirmed the calculation was correct. Woodford Investment Management results are due at the end of the year.", "description": "Woodford and Craig Newman, who together set up Woodford Investment Management in 2014 after leaving Invesco, have always paid themselves in chunky dividends rather than through a salary.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
