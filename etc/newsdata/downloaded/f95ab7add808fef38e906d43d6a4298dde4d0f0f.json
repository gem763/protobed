So far this month China has taken steps to support the economy, and U.S. and European central banks eased policy,\" said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n\n\"There are hopes of an interim or partial trade deal between China as U.S. President Trump will need to shore up the economy next year before the election,\" he added.\n\nU.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators resumed face-to-face talks for the first time in nearly two months on Thursday, trying to lay the groundwork for high-level talks in early October.\n\nHopes for a deal were so strong that the markets shrugged off a media report that a trade adviser to Trump has said the U.S. president is ready to raise tariffs to 50 or 100 percent.\n\nThe New York Fed continued to inject a large amount of cash in money markets to deal with funding squeeze since the start of week, helping to bring down interest rates in the U.S. repo market, a key funding market.\n\nIn currency markets, the British pound kept its uptrend after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a Brexit deal is possible and that if the Irish border backstop which the British government wants removed could be replaced with alternatives, it would not be needed.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2533, up 0.09% on the day, having hit a two-month high of $1.2560 on Thursday. The British unit stood near its highest levels in almost four months versus the euro at 88.19 pence per euro.\n\nThe euro was at $1.105, staying in a holding pattern this week.\n\nThe yen edged up to at 107.91 yen to the dollar, off its 1-1/2 month low of 108.48 yen hit on Wednesday.\n\nThe Brazilian real fell 1.4% on Thursday to 4.167 to the dollar after the central bank slashed borrowing costs to an all-time low and signalled it was prepared to do so again in the coming months.\n\nOil prices bounced back on continued worries about the stability of oil supply as tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran showed little sign of abating after a weekend attack on Saudi oil installations.\n\nSaudi-led forces on Friday launched a military operation on northern Yemen against what it described as \"legitimate military targets\", an incident that could aggravate regional tensions.\n\nWashington said on Thursday it was building a coalition to deter Iranian threats while Tehran has warned Trump against being dragged into a war in the Middle East and said it would meet any offensive action with a crushing response.\n\nfutures rose 0.78% to $64.90 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 1.14% to $58.79 per barrel.", "description": "Economy hopes support shares, oil edges up on Mideast tensions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8J03X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
