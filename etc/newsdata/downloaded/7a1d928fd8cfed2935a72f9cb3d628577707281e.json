I knew it existed. And I\u2019ve seen some Category 4s. You don\u2019t even see them that much. But a Category 5 is something that, uh, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve never even heard the term, other than I know it\u2019s there. That\u2019s the ultimate. And that\u2019s what we have, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Trump has expressed shock at a Category 5 storm. When Hurricane Irma struck Florida in 2017, Trump said he \u201cnever even knew a Category 5 existed.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump on the existence of Category 5 hurricanes, 2017-2019. pic.twitter.com/IRRny20hfp \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) September 1, 2019\n\nThen when Hurricane Michael struck the Florida Panhandle last year as a Category 5 storm, Trump again said he hadn\u2019t heard of a Category 5 storm.\n\nOddly, though, when it comes to Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico in 2017, obliterating the island\u2019s infrastructure, Trump has repeatedly called the storm a Category 5 \u2014 though it was a Category 4 storm at landfall. He has also lambasted the island\u2019s government and repeatedly sought to hold back federal aid or tie it to government reforms, something he has not done in responding to natural disasters in other parts of the United States.\n\nTrump\u2019s ignorance of how hurricanes are classified would not be a problem if he were not the one in charge of hurricane response, making sure the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies are up to the task of aiding hard-hit areas.\n\nIf there were ever a president with intimate knowledge of what damage Category 5 storms can cause, it would be Trump, given how many such storms have occurred during his presidency.\n\nAs #HurricaneDorian approached the #AbacoIslands, NOAA's #GOESEast zoomed in on the powerful storm's eye. The Cat. 5 storm's \"maximum winds have increased to near 175 mph with gusts over 200 mph,\" according to @NHC_Atlantic.

And climate studies show a trend toward more Category 4 and 5 storms in the future, along with more frequent instances of storms that rapidly intensify, which can complicate evacuation and storm preparation.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unlikely that Trump will accept such findings, given his rejection of climate science in general.", "description": "President Trump has a strange Category 5 blind spot when it comes to powerful hurricanes striking on his watch.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "September At Am", "Andrew Freedman Edits", "Reports On Weather", "Extreme Weather", "Climate Science For Capital Weather Gang.
