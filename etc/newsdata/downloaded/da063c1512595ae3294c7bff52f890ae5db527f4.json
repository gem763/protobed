What an awful week for those who drive to work. The first full week of back-to-school has been truly terrible.\n\nCombine the heavy volume with many collisions, some broken water mains, at least one rollover, a bear on Highway 417 in rural west Ottawa yesterday, construction and road closures.\n\nMinor sinkhole on Katimavik Road.
