Even American Samoa is faced with challenges.\n\nIn addition to the long-ignored U.S. territories, there are three island-republics \u2014 the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau \u2014 that have relied upon the grace and favor of the United States since the postwar years. The relationship between these freely associated states and Washington is governed through an instrument called the Compact of Free Association.\n\nTogether, the territories and island-republics are geographically situated between Hawaii and the Philippines \u2014 itself a former U.S. territory that should have been admitted to the Union \u2014 in a vast swath of the Indo-Pacific informally called the American Lake. The nickname reflects what was an exclusive U.S. sphere of influence. Until the rise of China, the only other power exercising postwar clout here was Australia, which is also struggling to confront Chinese influence.\n\nThe receding of the American Lake became most evident during the final years of President Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nDespite its so-called Pivot to Asia, the Obama administration did little to assert itself on these islands. I discovered this reality during the 2016 presidential campaign, when I island-hopped across the territories for Sen. Ted Cruz until jumping ship and endorsing then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s campaign acutely recognized not only the geopolitical importance of these islands, but their overlooked power in intra-party politics. Not only do American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas have elected governors, legislatures and even delegates to Congress, but each also has a Republican Party that sends a full delegation to the national convention. Those delegates become critical in a competitive race for the Republican nomination, as was the case in 2016.\n\nChina\u2019s inroads have been helped by the War on Terror, which has occupied Washington\u2019s attention for the past 18 years.\n\nBeijing\u2019s targets in the Indo-Pacific and closer to home in the Caribbean and Latin America generally share the same characteristics: Poor when compared to the GDP of the 50 states, underdeveloped and generally forgotten. All sorts of basic infrastructure and other improvements are built or promised. Think hospitals, schools, highways, ports and airports. Some are freebies; others involve loans that will never be repaid. Moreover, as independent countries they have full voting privileges at the United Nations. This in and of itself is worth every yuan.\n\nThe Solomon Islands, one of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s \u201cother realms and territories,\u201d became the most recent example. It ended diplomatic recognition of Taiwan after China promised $500 million in funding. Closer to home, Panama with the strategically important Panama Canal \u2014 another former U.S. territory \u2014 and the Dominican Republic, which voted for U.S. annexation in 1869 during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, have also aligned with Beijing.\n\nIn addition to tariffs against China the president has also dispatched senior administration officials, including cabinet secretaries, and military leaders to the territories and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific. Mr. Trump even hosted a historic White House summit with heads of state from the island-republics.\n\nThe administration rightly understands that U.S. hegemony is at stake, if the flag isn\u2019t flown over the American Lake. But merely flying the flag or even levying tariffs isn\u2019t enough. Washington must up its game.\n\nIt should start with a revival of the Monroe Doctrine. There also needs to be a re-examining of the relationship with the islands and their individual political status or lack thereof. This should include statehood.\n\nJust look at the secretary of Interior, who oversees four of the five territories and all three island-republics albeit without viceregal powers over local affairs. (Puerto Rico is treated as a state by the federal government.)\n\nRyan Zinke, President Trump\u2019s former Interior secretary, visited each territory within the administration\u2019s first year. Not only was that a remarkable feat given the significant travel distances, but it could be a new record since it took eight years for his predecessor in the Obama administration to do the same. Just recently, Assistant Secretary of Interior Doug Domenech flew halfway across the world to pay homage to island leaders and pass out Uncle Sam\u2019s money, including over $9 million for \u201cimprovements\u201d in Palau.\n\nThe islands should be the bailiwick of a standalone agency with cabinet rank. The natural choice to head such an agency is former two-term Republican Gov. Eddie Calvo of Guam.\n\nSimply put, it is an affront to Americans in American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas and the Virgin Islands that the department best known for national parks and wild horses is responsible for their affairs. Congress is also to blame, as the House of Representatives and Senate both relegate oversight of the territories to obscure subcommittees.\n\nNot only does the institutionalized benign neglect only cement the second-class status of the territories, but it pushes the island-republics closer to China.\n\nA good example: The children of illegal immigrants born in any of the 50 states have more rights than Americans born or living in the territories. The second-class status of Americans in the territories was repudiated by the Republican National Committee, which supports the full and equal citizenship of all Americans. However, neither the White House nor a Republican in Congress have taken this up.\n\nThen there is the question of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau.\n\nThey should be given the option of becoming either territories or joining Guam and the Northern Marianas to form the 51st state. This idea was made recently by Richard Carroll in the International Policy Digest, though he wrongly advocated statehood for the island-republics ahead of existing territories.\n\nBeyond equal citizenship and political equality, the overarching need for a revived Monroe Doctrine in the Indo-Pacific, Caribbean and Latin America cannot be said enough. Without it, China will supplant the United States.\n\n\u2022 Dennis Lennox is a political commentator and public affairs consultant.
