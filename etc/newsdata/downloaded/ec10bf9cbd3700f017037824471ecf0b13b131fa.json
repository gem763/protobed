Where did their childhoods go so wrong? And, most terrifyingly, what drove them to commit such heinous crimes?\n\nThis month, Sky Crime, the new home of true crime, launched with the most compelling cases from the UK and US, allowing us to get under the skin of a serial killer like never before.\n\nAmong the fascinating true crime documentaries are Kemper On Kemper: Inside The Mind Of A Serial Killer, Mark Of A Killer and In Defense Of, which all delve deeper into the real-life stories behind these notorious attackers \u2013 and their hideous crimes.\n\nSo, how do we begin to try and understand the mind of a serial killer?\n\nSky Crime documentary Kemper on Kemper gives a unique insight into the crimes of \u2018Co-Ed Killer\u2019 Ed Kemper, told in his own words\n\nWho is ED KEMPER? \u2018The Co-Ed Killer\u2019 Six-foot-nine US serial killer Edmund Kemper is explored in the Sky Crime documentary Kemper on Kemper: Inside The Mind Of A Serial Killer. The investigation explores how a highly-intelligent Californian man, also known as the Co-Ed Killer, went on to murder and dismember 10 people, including his own mother. Was Kemper a product of a troubled upbringing, or was he born to kill? In an eye opening interview, Kemper reveals how he obsessed over death from a young age, initially killing his family pet and soon leading to the murder of his own grandparents by the age of 15. So, when he turned himself in the 1970s after a lifetime of cold-blooded murders, how could he possibly still be declared sane?\n\nThe FBI has been profiling \u2018multiple murderers\u2019 since the mid-1940s, when it was first decided that there may be similarities that link these types of criminals together, as well as intricacies to their crimes that set them apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey defined a \u2018serial murder\u2019 as \u2018the unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s), in separate events\u2019 and devised official methods to analyse these types of behaviours that investigators still use today.\n\nOften, it begins with dissecting the crimes themselves, asking whether the murderer kills in the same way each time or targets a certain type of person.\n\nResearch suggests that overall, men and women are equal targets for serial killers in the US, although the choice of victim is far from haphazard.\n\nSky Crime, the new home of true crime, launches this month with a raft of thrilling documentaries unpicking the cases of serial killers, like Mark Of A Killer\n\nWho is DANNY ROLLING? \u2018Gainesville Ripper\u2019 Episode one of Sky Crime\u2019s Mark Of A Killer takes a closer look at Danny Rolling, aka The Gainesville Ripper, whose three-day rampage left five Florida students dead in 1990. Despite meticulously covering his tracks with cleaning solvents, he left disturbing clues that linked his crimes together. So, did Rolling want to be caught? Or, was this a cunning way to taunt the police? When the serial killer was finally captured, with his father being the last person he tried to kill before his crime spree ended, it led many to ask what motivated his heinous crimes.\n\nThis latest documentary examines the murderer in an extremely unique way as he explains in his own words why he went on a 20-year killing spree.\n\nWas he motivated by power, vengeance, notoriety or greed? Or is there something fundamentally different about Ed Kemper, and other serial killers, that drove them to these crimes?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearch with over 3,000 of these murderers has found that 32 per cent say \u2018enjoyment\u2019 was the reason they carried out their crimes, which could explain why some criminals leave a calling card at the scene to taunt police.\n\nThe Sky Crime documentary Mark Of A Killer identifies the various clues and symbols that killers such as the \u2018Gainesville Ripper\u2019 and the \u2018Dating Game Killer\u2019 left behind, dissecting the disturbing traits of these attackers.\n\nConvicting a person accused of multiple murders can be harder than it seems, like the curious case of Robert Durst as documented in The Jinx (Picture: 2019 Home Box Office, Inc. All Rights Reserved)\n\nWho is ROBERT DURST? \u2018The Jinx\u2019 The case against New York real estate heir Robert Durst has now spanned almost four decades \u2013 and it\u2019s still not over. Sky Crime documentary, The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, tells the unbelievable story of how suspected triple killer Durst has evaded jail time for crimes he is continuously linked to. In 2004, Durst was cleared of murdering his neighbour, Morris Black, despite dismembering his body and dumping it in a river. So, if Durst is capable of killing someone, how did he get away with it? More to the point, will the same thing happen when Durst goes on trial in 2020 for the murder of his best friend and confidante Susan Berman in 2000? Perhaps we\u2019ll know whether Berman\u2019s death had anything to do with the disappearance of Durst\u2019s first wife Kathleen McCormack in 1982, and if so, finally discover what Durst has to do with both cases.\n\nDo these patterns indicate a desire to be caught? Or, could these clues be part of a sick game that adds to the killer\u2019s \u2018enjoyment\u2019 or feeling of dominance over authority?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, nearly half of all multiple murderers in the US now get caught after two killings compared to 40 years ago, when nearly one in three serial killers got away with five or more.\n\nYet it\u2019s convicting these criminals that is sometimes the most complex part of the story.\n\nTake the curious case of New York real estate heir Robert Durst who has been accused of multiple murders.\n\nThe fascinating twists and turns are examined in Sky Crime documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, asking how the multi-millionaire got away with potentially three murders of the people closet to him. Was it a string of a bad luck or cold blooded killing?\n\nIn Defense Of is the documentary that shows the conflict of defending a multiple murderer\n\nWho is TED BUNDY? The Campus Killer Ted Bundy is still one of the most complex serial killers the world has ever known about. Certainly this presentable, well-mannered and educated man didn\u2019t seem like a mass murderer in court, which made people question whether police had captured the wrong man. Surely, the Bundy in the media and on television screens wasn\u2019t an evil man, so what made him into a serial killer and does it explain his crimes? Moreover, in the case of one of the most prolific killing sprees in history, how does anyone go about defending him? Sky Crime\u2019s In Defense Of now speaks to criminal defense attorney John Henry Browne, the man tasked with representing Bundy, asking was Bundy born evil? And if you believe so, how does it feel to sit next to a man in court accused of being one of America\u2019s sickest and most sophisticated serial killers?\n\nThen there\u2019s the eye-opening true crime series, In Defense Of, also airing on Sky Crime this October, which gives unprecedented access to the attorneys tasked with representing defendants accused of multiple murders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach standalone episode covers a different high-profile case, featuring the defense lawyers from the trials of Branch Davidians member Clive Doyle and serial killer Ted Bundy, allowing us to unpick the facts of their cases and make up our own mind about their guilt, motives or sentence.\n\nAnd finally, is there a personal cost or professional impact of defending such notorious clients, and if their conviction hinges on the killer\u2019s mental state, can they still be held accountable for their crimes?\n\nDelve deeper into the minds of killers by tuning in to watch Kemper on Kemper, The Jinx, Mark Of A Killer and In Defense Of on brand new channel, Sky Crime, the new home of true crime.", "description": "For years some of the world's top psychiatrists have been trying to answer one question: what makes a serial killer tick?
