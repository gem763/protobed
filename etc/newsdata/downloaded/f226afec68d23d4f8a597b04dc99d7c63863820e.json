We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence, and come to the negotiating table,\u201d Pence told reporters, adding that he and national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien would be heading to Turkey in the \u201cimmediate future\u201d to persuade Erdogan to stop the offensive.\n\nTrump has faced blistering criticism at home and abroad for effectively greenlighting Erdogan\u2019s long-threatened offensive by withdrawing U.S. troops from the border region, abandoning key partners the Kurds in the process.\n\nSince Turkey invaded last week, more than 70 civilians, 135 Kurdish-led fighters, and 122 pro-Turkish fighters have been killed, along with eight Turkish soldiers, according to the British-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s betrayal of the Kurds is as incoherent as it is dangerous\n\nThe fighting has driven more than 160,000 people from their homes, sparking fears of a looming humanitarian crisis, and forced the Kurds to seek help from the Syrian regime, whose forces have swept into the north to challenge the Turkish invasion.\n\nBut despite Trump\u2019s new action against Turkey, which comes after days of appearing to simply acquiesce to the invasion, the president made clear he wasn\u2019t planning to backtrack on his decision to pull troops out of the region.\n\n\u201cAs I have said, I am withdrawing the remaining United States service members from northeast Syria,\u201d he said Monday. The troops would remain in the region, with a \u201csmall footprint\u201d of U.S. forces to remain at Tanf Garrison in southern Syria to continue the fight against ISIS.\n\nREAD: Trump\u2019s Syria pullout is a disaster for the Kurds and a gift to ISIS\n\nU.S. lawmakers, furious about Trump\u2019s precipitous withdrawal, are moving to impose sanctions of their own. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blasted the troop pullout Monday, saying that \u201cabandoning this fight now and withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Erdogan, who has shrugged moves by European nations to pressure him to abandon the offensive, vowed in a televised speech that he would continue until his objectives are achieved. He plans to drive Kurdish fighters, which he considers indistinguishable from Kurdish separatists in southern Turkey, away from the border region, then repopulate the area with about 2 million Syrian refugees.\n\n\"God willing, we will quickly secure the region stretching from Manbij to our border with Iraq and ensure that, in the first stage, 1 million, and then 2 million Syrian refugees return to their homes on their own free will,\u201d he said.\n\nBritain announced Tuesday it was suspending arms exports to Turkey, following similar moves elsewhere in Europe. EU member-states pledged to suspend arms exports to Turkey Monday, prompting Turkey to respond that it would reconsider its cooperation with the bloc in light of its \u201cunlawful and biased\u201d approach.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the U.N.\u2019s human rights office called on Turkey to investigate alleged war crimes being carried out by its proxy militias, following the emergence of footage that appeared to show summary executions of Kurds. \u201cTurkey could be deemed as a state responsible for violations by their affiliated groups,\u201d spokesman Rupert Colville said.\n\nCover: In this photo taken from the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria, in Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, smoke and dust billows from targets in Ras al-Ayn, Syria, caused by bombardment by Turkish forces, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019.
