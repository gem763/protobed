As tensions eased in Hong Kong, equities took flight. It leaves investors wondering if the markets can start to go higher or if the seasonally tough September will still cause some swoons. Let\u2019s look at a few top stock trades.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Roku\n\ntop stock trades for ROKU More\n\nOne stock that hasn\u2019t felt any swoon? Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). This name has rallied so much this year it\u2019s incredible. The stock is up almost 450% in 2019 and many are wondering when the rally will end.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat speculation likely only fuels the fire, but at some point it has to be true.\n\nRoku added another 8% at one point in Wednesday\u2019s session, surging to new all-time highs. The stock is now in nosebleed territory. I couldn\u2019t justify buying the name after this type of run, but that\u2019s easier to say after we\u2019ve been pounding the table about Roku on InvestorPlace all year.\n\nOn a pullback, ROKU may be worth a stab.\n\nBuyers stepped in at $130 last time. But when the stock is this hot, we just have to see where it ends up after it secures a high. Let\u2019s see if that comes this session, or in the next few.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: Starbucks\n\ntop stock trades for SBUX More\n\nRoku has been a relative strength machine, as has Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). However, the latter was slipping in early Wednesday trading after the company\u2019s outlook disappointed investors.\n\nThis one is interesting. On the plus side, investors bid up the name off its lows, which came on a near test of the 50-day moving average. On the downside, its ascending triangle pattern has failed to materialize.\n\nSBUX can still be friendly to longs, but will need to take out $97.50 on the upside. On the downside, watch the 50-day moving average and Wednesday\u2019s lows.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Lyft\n\ntop stock trades for LYFT More\n\nShares of Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) were all over the place on Wednesday, but in a good way. The stock opened higher on the day, but quickly took out Tuesday\u2019s low, making new 52-week lows.\n\nThis was an excellent green-to-red trade, and one we were watching ahead of the open.\n\nHowever, LYFT then went positive on the day, giving investors an excellent two-way trade as it reversed higher. Nimble traders could short the green-to-red move and then buy the reversal.\n\nInvestors who are long can use Wednesday\u2019s low as their stop and look for a rebound up toward $47.50, where it will find a notable level as well as channel resistance. Above it and a move to the 20-day moving average is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Silver\n\ntop stock trades for SLV More\n\nThe iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:SLV) ripped another 2% on Wednesday and while \u201cripped\u201d may seem like an exaggerated description, consider the move over the past few weeks.", "description": "Global equity markets were in a good mood on Wednesday.
