REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n\nDays after millions of young people demanded an end to the fossil-fuel era in protests around the globe, a new report by a U.N.-backed panel of experts found that radical action may yet avert some of the worst possible outcomes of global warming.\n\nBut the study was clear that allowing carbon emissions to continue rising would upset the balance of the geophysical systems governing oceans and the frozen regions of the Earth so profoundly that nobody would escape untouched.\n\n\u201cWe are in a race between two factors, one is the capacity of humans and ecosystems to adapt, the other is the speed of impact of climate change. This report...indicates we may be losing in this race. We need to take immediate and drastic action to cut emissions right now,\u201d IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee said at the presentation of the report in Monaco.\n\nFinalised on Tuesday in a marathon 27-hour session of talks in Monaco between authors and representatives of governments, the report was the culmination of two years\u2019 efforts by the U.N.-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nCompiled by more than 100 authors who crunched 7,000 academic papers, the study documents the implications of warming oceans, fast-melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica and shrinking glaciers for more than 1.3 billion people living in low-lying or high-mountain regions.\n\nThe report projects that sea levels could rise by one meter (3.3 ft) by 2100 \u2014 ten times the rate in the 20th century \u2014 if emissions keep climbing. The rise could exceed five meters by 2300.\n\nIn the Himalayas, glaciers feeding ten rivers, including the Ganges and Yangtze, could shrink dramatically if emissions do not fall, hitting water supplies across a swathe of Asia.\n\nThawing permafrost in places like Alaska and Siberia could release vast quantities of greenhouse gases, potentially unleashing feedback loops driving faster warming.\n\nThe IPCC galvanized global concern over climate change in October when it published a report that showed the world would need to halve emissions over the next decade to stand a chance of meeting the temperature goals in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nFollowing a subsequent report published last month on land use and farming, the IPCC Special Report on the Oceans and Cryosphere \u2014 or \u2018frozen world\u2019 \u2014 was the final piece in a scientific jigsaw revealing the global sweep of climate impacts.\n\nReleased two days after a one-day U.N. climate summit in New York closed with scant signs of transformative action by major economies, the latest report underscored the gulf between warnings from science and the policies of most governments.\n\nIn Monaco, IPCC members avoided criticizing policy makers.\n\n\u201cThe IPCC does not judge the action of world leaders but the fact that this report was called for ... is an indication of the extent to which science is becoming central to choosing pathways to a more sustainable future,\u201d IPCC co-chair Debra Roberts said.\n\nTRIPLE BLOW\n\nCarbon emissions, which hit a record high last year, are projected to inflict a devastating toll on oceans, which have so far buffered almost all man-made warming generated by burning coal, oil and gas.\n\nAs the oceans get hotter, so-called \u201cmarine heatwaves\u201d are becoming more intense, turning coral reefs boneyard white \u2014 including much of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef.\n\nIPCC co-chair Hans-Otto Portner said coral reefs may be among those biological systems which have already passed beyond the tipping point of irreversible change.\n\nAs more carbon dioxide dissolves in the water, the oceans are also becoming more acidic, damaging ecosystems.\n\nThe rising temperatures are also starving the upper layers of the water of oxygen, suffocating marine life, creating growing dead zones, and disrupting the circulation of ocean currents, which then unleashes more disruptive weather on land.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nThe authors say that long lag times at work in oceans mean some of these changes will intensify over centuries \u2014 even if the world stopped emitting all its greenhouses gases tomorrow.\n\nBut if emissions are allowed to continue rising then the impacts are likely to start accelerating so rapidly that they will overwhelm societies\u2019 capacity to cope, with the poorest and most vulnerable communities and countries succumbing first.\n\n\u201cIn a high emissions scenario, the chances of having any reasonable foothold to deal with the impacts becomes much smaller,\u201d said Matthias Garschagen, chair in human geography at LMU Munich and one of the report\u2019s authors.", "description": "Scientists behind a landmark study of the links between oceans, glaciers, ice caps and the climate delivered a stark warning to the world on Wednesday: slash emissions or watch cities vanish under rising seas, rivers run dry and marine life collapse.", "authors": ["Matthew Green", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433710049&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0OX", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
