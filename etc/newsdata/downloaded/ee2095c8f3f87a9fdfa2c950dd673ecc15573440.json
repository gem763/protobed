She\u2019s \u201cthe Midnight Venus,\u201d our \u201cguide for the night\u201d through the Golden Playhouse Special Feature. That special feature is the story of Vincent Brooks, Catherine\u2019s protagonist.\n\nThe opening scene is the first in a parade of aesthetic flourishes and unwavering camp that made this game stand out. It\u2019s disappointing, then, that Catherine: Full Body \u2014 the 2019 remix of the game that first came out in 2011 \u2014 not only fails to fix some of the narrative issues with Catherine but also adds to some of them.\n\nIn both the original and updated versions of Catherine, protagonist Vincent Brooks is a 32-year-old man who\u2019s fallen into a comfortable routine with his longtime girlfriend, Katherine McBride. He\u2019s shaken out of his complacency when Katherine brings up the subject of marriage, which deeply freaks him out.\n\nOn top of that, another woman named Catherine suddenly appears in his life; he meets her at his local hangout, the Stray Sheep bar. After a night of drinking, he wakes up in bed next to her but has no idea what happened.\n\nAround that time, he also begins having nightmares during which he has to climb a gigantic tower of blocks, nightmares that he forgets every morning but which seem to be connected to a growing trend in his waking life of other men dying suddenly and gruesomely in their sleep.\n\nThe game is split between these nightmares and Vincent\u2019s time at the Stray Sheep, where he can drink, text the women in his life, and talk with other patrons, some of whom appear in his nightmares in sheep form. The choices you make during these interactions, particularly the text messages, move the dial on a metre that affects some of Vincent\u2019s interactions in the short term and determines the game\u2019s several possible endings in the long term. It\u2019s a dating sim with puzzles, basically.\n\nThe original 2011 version of Catherine is a cult classic, but it doesn\u2019t go down without a few eye rolls. While the game halfheartedly tries to make its characters more complex, Katherine is often portrayed as a shrewish would-be wife to Vincent\u2019s clueless sitcom spouse archetype, and Catherine is all titties and giggles when she\u2019s not showing her violently threatening jealous streak.\n\nCatherine\u2019s mood swings are made even worse when you remember that the entire game takes place over the course of about a week. Side characters range from wildly sexist pigs to men with mummy issues, often played for laughs. \u201cMen who want to control women tend to have a desire to be controlled by them. It\u2019s the truth,\u201d one character opines.\n\nThe game became a cult hit because the core gameplay of puzzling and decision-making is compelling, but also, it\u2019s hard not to get caught up in the campiness and surreality of its narrative style at moments.\n\nIt\u2019s full of predictable tropes based in reductive assumptions about the supposedly wide gulf between men and women, but it\u2019s also got some moments that are actually funny and relatable. This new remix of Catherine keeps in all of the good and bad from the original. It also adds in new narrative paths, which \u2014 similar to the original \u2014 have their good and bad moments.\n\nThe game still works surprisingly well, a testament to Atlus\u2019 talent for making games greater than the sum of their parts thanks to aesthetic flourishes and attention to detail. Throughout the game, for example, a \u201cGolden Playhouse\u201d logo appears during cutscenes, reminding you that you\u2019re watching a program.\n\nWhenever you finish a drink at the bar, a smooth voice chimes in to give you real, actual fun facts about alcohol. There\u2019s a text message Vincent receives from his phone carrier about online storage with the subject \u201cAttachment Issues.\u201d Loading screens feature quotes from all sorts of real-life artists about love and dating and life.\n\nVincent looking at his phone in a bar and trying to open a photo that turns out to be an unexpected nude leads to the familiar reflex of having to quickly and shamefully hide the screen from others; you can only actually open it in the bathroom.\n\nUsing the framing device of the \u201cGolden Playhouse\u201d program, Atlus has seamlessly incorporated Full Body\u2019s new additions as though they are also part of the show. The most notable difference is that there\u2019s now a third woman to expand Vincent\u2019s messy love life, Rin (thankfully she doesn\u2019t go by her other name, Qatherine).\n\nThe story is told with a mixture of smooth, late-night-jazz-radio-style narration, dialogue, and anime cutscenes, drawing on influences from romance, horror, sitcoms and even literature. As Vincent drinks and dreams his way through a whirlwind week of women, wine, and wumbo-size trouble, I find myself wondering how a game could at once be so out-there and charming while also bafflingly leaning on some of the worst tropes of the discourse it draws upon.\n\nCatherine presents ideas about men and women and dating through the lens of a bunch of hapless adults trying to figure their shit out. The game is full of stories that delve into the complexities of adulthood and gender, and its moments of cleverness in this area make its missteps feel all the more frustrating.\n\nWhile there are some pretty ridiculous views about gender in the game, many of them are very clearly framed as the asinine ramblings of men navigating a sexist society. There are worthwhile conversations to find in the game, and the general interrogation of monogamy was refreshing. Full Body more prominently introduces the idea of love transcending societal boundaries like gender, which was also pretty cool at first.\n\nUltimately, though, Full Body failed to do these topics justice.\n\nIn both its original form and its remix, Catherine attaches the idea of polyamory to a maniacal succubus. The True ending to the storyline in which Vincent chooses Catherine, the blond bombshell who shakes Vincent\u2019s life up, involves him becoming a demon and leading a life of wild sexual escapades. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with becoming a demon if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, or whatever, but in a broader thematic sense, the ending is an extremely flat and sex-obsessed way to think about polyamory.\n\nOn the game\u2019s choice metre, which is presented as Freedom vs. Order, it\u2019s the Freedom option. Despite the fact that in real life, polyamory often introduces yet more moving pieces to manage, the game treats it like a disordered free-for-all and frames monogamy as a sure shot for stability. Neither is true.\n\nFull Body continues Catherine\u2019s trend of trying to meaningfully interrogate social taboos but falling short. First, there\u2019s Rin, whose storyline gets folded into the narrative smoothly but still has a host of its own issues.\n\nFirst off, there\u2019s a strange white knight vibe between her and Vincent that\u2019s supposed to be sweet but comes off sort of creepy. In their first meeting, Vincent saves her from a stalker, then learns that Rin has amnesia. He then helps her get a job and an apartment\u2026 right next door to his.\n\nShe appears young and innocent, and while I don\u2019t get straight up underage love affair vibes from the situation, her sheer naivet\u00e9 makes moments like Vincent noticing her bare skin and zipping up her hoodie while blushing feel a little gross.\n\nThen there\u2019s Rin\u2019s central conflict. Late in the story, Vincent sees her naked; the player doesn\u2019t see what Vincent sees, but he reacts with shock when looking at her genitals. He freaks out, slaps her hand away, and runs out the door. After this, other characters arbitrarily start calling Rin a man and using he/him pronouns to refer to her.\n\nLater, Vincent explains that he doesn\u2019t know whether Rin even thinks about gender in such a binary way, which may be true, since in an earlier scene she explains that she doesn\u2019t see what the big deal is with the gender of people in love. But for some reason, Vincent still finds issue with calling her a woman, despite the fact that one of his closest friends, Erica, is trans.\n\nHe also doesn\u2019t go so far out of his way to correct other characters when they call Rin a man. \u201cWoman might not be the best word,\u201d Vincent explains to Katherine in an ending where he chooses Rin. \u201cThey must be really special,\u201d Katherine responds.\n\nErica, who is clearly hurt by Vincent\u2019s behaviour, scolds Vincent for reacting to Rin so poorly. After this conversation, Vincent gets over himself and decides to apologise to Rin.\n\nSpeaking of Erica, her and Vincent\u2019s old high school friends, Orlando and Chief, constantly make snide comments about Erica\u2019s womanhood and continually warn their younger friend Toby not to date her (he does anyway). Toby notes that when they eventually have sex \u2014 Toby\u2019s first time, by the way \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s something weird about it.\u201d\n\nIn one ending, Toby even asks for his \u201cv-card\u201d back after finding out Erica is trans. These depictions play with dangerous ideas about disclosure and the idea of trans women \u201ctrapping\u201d men, which is a nasty stereotype.\n\nAlso, the moments when Vincent\u2019s friends are being transphobic douchebags aren\u2019t really pushed back on by other characters in the same way that a lot of other silly dating ideas get debated and pushed back on in characters\u2019 conversations in the game. Vincent\u2019s bigoted friends don\u2019t get any flack for comments like this: \u201cNo matter how cute, the kid\u2019s packin\u2019 heat, man.\u201d\n\nFor a game that\u2019s about conflicting opinions and learning and growing, the transmisogynistic moments are given a lot of breathing room and seem to be played for laughs at trans women\u2019s expense.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, because Erica is otherwise written as a plucky, interesting woman with a lot of empathy for her friends. But a reasonable character in an absurd story can easily end up looking like more of a footstool for other characters\u2019 growth than a real person.\n\nSome of the new additions to Catherine work better than others. The new ending for Katherine shows her coming into her own in an awesome way and leaving Vincent in the dust, which I found refreshing. The new ending for Catherine bafflingly erases the transition of Erica, its first trans character, with no explanation, which I found infuriating.\n\nThe addition of Rin excited me as a nonbinary person until they handled the language around her so poorly \u2014 not to mention, she ultimately ends up revealing that she is an alien. This reveal meant to be a fun upturning of the fact that Vincent thought her whole \u201csecret\u201d deal was being trans, but it\u2019s kind of a silly way to address that for a game that started off so deeply entrenched in banal gender essentialism.\n\nIn the end, Rin\u2019s addition made Vincent much more compelling than he seemed in the original. Preceding his blowup in Rin\u2019s apartment, he isn\u2019t a ball of speechless nerves around her like he is with the other [-]atherines, instead showing an actual gentle side that makes it less baffling for Katherine and Catherine to have liked him in the first place.\n\nBetween his irresponsible binge-drinking and superhuman displays of indecision, it\u2019s pleasant to see Vincent be a functional person for once. Some of the newly added scenes have made the rest of the game stronger as well. Sweet, early glimpses of Katherine and Vincent\u2019s relationship make her seem far more relatable and less cartoonishly shrewish.\n\nBut the game continues to hamstring itself with the way it balances Vincent\u2019s supporting characters, especially the ridiculous portrayal of Catherine. Full Body is certainly less flat than its source, but for a game so lovingly detailed in its weird, sexy execution, its missteps are hard to ignore.\n\n\u201cMen and women. They\u2019re more complicated than you think!\u201d a triumphant Vincent exclaims toward the end of the game as he surmounts dream-world obstacles to reach self-actualisation.\n\nIt\u2019s hilariously on the nose, and at some point, maybe in 2011 when the game came out, it probably seemed like a good thesis for an edgy game about sex and lust and love. But it also encapsulates the game\u2019s issues: Gender is more complicated than just men and women, just like human relationships are more complicated than the binary of freedom and order.\n\nFor all its navel gazing, Catherine never quite breaks out of those restraints.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s aged nicely, with a sensual flavour, not unlike a fine wine,\u201d purrs Trisha in Atlus\u2019 Catherine: Full Body while sipping a glass of red, describing the \u201cprogram\u201d on the analogue TV on the bar next to her....", "authors": ["Nathan Grayson", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ihhodksffdaqrrkr0tdg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
