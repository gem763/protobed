That\u2019s what happens next, right?\n\nMOORE: Well, year. Remember Agnew went before Nixon, Agnew was Nixon\u2019s vice president, and that was about a year before that Watergate impeachment. There may not be enough time, but what the Constitution says has to happen is, Pence becomes president [if President Trump is impeached] and then the next in line is Nancy Pelosi. But he may go with Trump. I think that this will probably end up in the courts, or at least at the Supreme Court.\n\nHASAN: I just want to get a sense of the room here, how you stand on a Trump vs. Pence presidency, here? Who would prefer a Trump presidency and rather he not be impeached and not get Pence? Who would prefer a Pence presidency to a Trump presidency?\n\nMOORE: Here\u2019s actually what is better about Pence over Trump. Pence has an ideology. Pence believes in things. Trump has no ideology, he only believes in Donald J.
