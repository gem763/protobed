I looked at my husband and just started sobbing.\n\n\"I guess I was in shock and my first thought was that I was going to die.\u201d\n\nLouise had a stent fitted into her left coronary artery at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, Chronicle Live reports.\n\nShe added: \u201cAs soon as the stent was put in place I immediately began to feel better. I couldn\u2019t believe it was that quick. The surgeon said there is a second blockage in my other artery, but it\u2019s not big enough to need a stent.\u201d\n\nNow the mum of twin daughters is campaigning for women to look after their heart health from a young age - as she worries too often heart attacks are assumed to impact only men.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation has launched a new briefing, revealing the inequalities in awareness, diagnosis and treatment of heart attacks killing women in the UK.\n\nIn the North East alone, around 1,600 women are admitted to hospital following a heart attack each year, the BHF says.\n\nThe charity estimates that around 17,000 women in the North East, like Louise, have survived a heart attack.\n\nThe BHF says its new research shows women often delay seeking medical help by more than two hours, reducing their chance of survival.\n\nSpeaking about the brewing symptoms, Louise, said: \u201cLooking back at the week before I was really tired and working long hours and juggling life with the kids.\n\n\"Two nights after I got back from work I literally fell asleep on the sofa, which was really unusual for me. I thought I\u2019d just hit a wall because of being a busy working mum \u2013 which I realise now is a typical female response.\n\n\"I had extreme tiredness before mine, but thought it was just because I was busy.\u201d\n\nNow Louise is more conscious of how and what she eats. She has also been proactive in creating a healthier work-life balance by not overworking or committing to long hours.\n\nIn a bid to educate her daughters, Louise confides in them about the reason they are going for a walk or doing sport.\n\nWorryingly, according to the BHF briefing, more than 8,200 women in England and Wales alone died over a 10-year period because they did not receive equal treatment to men.\n\nBut despite these stark figures, the condition is more treatable than it has ever been.\n\nDr Sonya Babu-Narayan, Consultant Cardiologist and Associate Medical Director of the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201cWomen are dying needlessly because heart attacks are often seen as a man\u2019s disease, and women simply don\u2019t receive the same standard of treatment as men.\n\n\"The studies detailed in this briefing have revealed inequalities at every stage of a woman\u2019s medical journey, and though complex to dissect, they add up to a societal failure to provide fair care for women. Together, we must change this.\"\n\nDr Babu-Narayan added one of the first steps in closing the gender gap is to raise national awareness of such inequalities and to tackle public perception of women and heart attacks.", "description": "Louise McGill,\u00a0 hopes to inform other women of heart attack symptoms as British Heart Foundation reveals women are dying needlessly because attacks are seen as a man\u2019s disease", "authors": ["Kali Lindsay", "Image", "Newcastle Chronicle Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20580741.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_JS195932538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
