The top deal was a recently renovated Edwardian six-bedroom house at the end of a terrace block in Chelsea. It boasts a master suite that spans the entire top floor and a modern open floor plan, according to a former listing for the rowhouse.\n\n\n\nThere were only two deals in England and Wales over \u00a310 million last month, the second of which was a stately manor in Surrey with an indoor swimming pool that sold for \u00a315.25 million. The newly constructed property, with six bedrooms, a steam room and home gym, hit the market several years ago asking \u00a323 million, Mansion Global previously reported.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Rare Whiskey Remains World\u2019s Best-Performing Luxury Asset\n\nThere\u2019s a lag time of several weeks to months between the final sale and when the deal is recorded with the Land Registry. It means the monthly data report provides a general picture of the movement of the market, rather than final figures.\n\n\n\nBeyond the luxury market, home sales overall contracted in September. They totaled 25,140 last month, down 18% from August, the data show.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-121448?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
