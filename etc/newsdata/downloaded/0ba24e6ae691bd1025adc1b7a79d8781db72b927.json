Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\n1. You can get 60,000 points when you sign up\n\nIn early 2019, Chase increased the sign-up bonus on the Sapphire Preferred \u2014 the first time it's raised the card's bonus since 2015. Now, when you open a new card, you can earn 60,000 Ultimate Rewards points when you spend $4,000 in the first three months.\n\nThe value of the sign-up bonus depends on how you choose to use those points, but based on subjective valuations by travel website The Points Guy (a Business Insider e-commerce partner), 60,000 points is worth about $1,200. While the points can be redeemed for $600 of cash or $750 of travel booked through Chase, you can get a significantly higher value when you transfer them to an airline frequent flyer partner \u2014 hence The Points Guy's higher valuation.\n\nThis bonus is actually higher than the Chase Sapphire Reserve's, which only offers 50,000 points for the same spending requirement.\n\nBecause of that, a smart move for someone just getting into credit card rewards would be to open the Sapphire Preferred, and then, if they decide the Sapphire Reserve would be a better fit, convert the card after the first year.\n\nConverting, or product-changing, is easy: a simple call to the number on the back of the card should be all you need.\n\nRead more: After months of contemplation, I finally upgraded to the Chase Sapphire Reserve with a 10-minute phone call.\n\n2. You'll earn double points on every travel and dining purchase\n\nThe Sapphire Preferred offers 2x points on all travel and all dining, and both categories are defined incredibly broadly. \"Travel\" includes everything from subways, taxis, parking, and tolls to hotels and airfare, and dining including bars, restaurants, delivery services like Seamless and Grubhub, and more.\n\nThe card has no foreign transaction fees, and the card offers the travel and dining bonus on purchases made outside of the US, too.\n\nYou'll earn even more points with the Sapphire Reserve, which offers 3x points in the same categories, which brings us to the next benefit...\n\n3. It has a low annual fee for such a high-earning rewards card\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred has an annual fee of $95. That puts it right in the \"mid-tier\" range, despite its high-earning rewards structure. While it has an annual fee, it's under $100, and the card still offers lucrative rewards and premium benefits.\n\nFor comparison, the Sapphire Reserve's fee is $450. Although the rewards and benefits more than make up for that, you'd still need to have the liquid cash available to pay the fee up front, then get the value back later.\n\n4. There are a ton of redemption options when it's time to use your points\n\nChase offers a few valuable ways to use your points \u2014 you can read our full guide here.\n\nOne option is to redeem them for cash or gift cards at a rate of 1\u00a2 per point. That means that your 60,000-point sign-up bonus would be worth $600.\n\nThe next option is to use points to book travel through Chase. When you do that, you'll get a 25% bonus in value \u2014 points will be worth 1.25\u00a2 each, so that 60,000 points would be worth $750.\n\nThe best option \u2014 the one that gets the most value \u2014 is to transfer them to one of Chase's 13 frequent flyer and hotel loyalty partners.\n\nWhile that last method can get complicated, it can easily be worth it; that's how I've booked flights in international first class for as few as 62,500 points.\n\n5. The card comes with a suite of useful travel benefits and protections.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred offers a handful of excellent travel benefits, including primary rental car insurance, trip and baggage delay insurance, trip cancellation/interruption coverage, and more. These benefits can save you hundreds of dollars when something goes wrong on a trip \u2014 or every time you rent a car, since you can decline the rental company's collision damage waiver.\n\nRead more: Having primary rental car insurance can save you time, money, and stress \u2014 here are the top credit cards that offer it.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nCombine normal points earning with a sign-up bonus of 60,000 points when you spend $4,000 in the first three months, and you'll be able to build a hefty balance of points quickly \u2014 especially if you and a partner use \"two-player mode.\"\n\nFor example, to earn the points we needed for our first-class Japan flights, I opened a Sapphire Preferred. Between the sign-up bonus, our normal spending, and a few reimbursable travel expenses for work trips \u2014 plus a handful of frequent flyer miles we already had \u2014 we had enough miles for the flights. We even saw our credit scores increase, since the new accounts added to our credit history.\n\nThere are a few different ways to use your Chase points \u2014 and tricks to get the most value \u2014 but no matter how you plan to redeem them, there's no doubt that the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers a great value.", "description": "The credit card rewards space is more competitive than ever, but the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is still a powerhouse.
