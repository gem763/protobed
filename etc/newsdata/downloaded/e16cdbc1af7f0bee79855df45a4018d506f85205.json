Eventually, he gently let it go.'\n\nThe diver has previously shared clips of his unsual meetings with sea creatures, including a very close encounter with a curious octopus in the French Riviera.\n\nThe huge cephalopod had engulfed Mr Desmet's camera with its body, before removing a piece of the lens and discarding it on the Mediterranean seabed.", "description": "The clip, filmed by\u00a0Eric Desmet in June, captures a young octopus as it grabs onto a camera which had been set up to record the cephalopod as it hid in a small cave.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/21/20054330-0-image-a-53_1571776874752.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
