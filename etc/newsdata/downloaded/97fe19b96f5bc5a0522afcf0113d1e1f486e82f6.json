When he reached their apartment block, he heard noise coming from the bushes.\n\nHe came closer to find out what was going on and saw Ivchenko squeezing his wife's throat while raping her.\n\nThe husband then attacked the rapist by punching him on the head before grabbing his Swiss army knife and chopping Ivchenko's penis off.\n\nThe husband's attorney Dmitry Spaskin said to local media: 'The husband lost the ability to control his actions. He did not understand what he was doing.'\n\nThe rapist's screams and the victim's sobbing woke up all the residents in the area who rushed to the scene.\n\nThe victim was walking near her apartment block after saying goodbye to friends in a nearby restaurant when she was attacked\n\nHer mother immediately reported Ivchenko to the police while others called an ambulance for him.\n\nMr Spaskin said: 'After the incident, [the husband] was in a state of shock and just walked away.\n\n'He walked about 13 kilometres and reached a neighbouring village. There he met an acquaintance and asked to drive him to a police station.\n\n'On October 13, at 7am, he handed himself into police and confessed in full.'\n\nThe husband was charged with causing grievous bodily harm and put under house arrest.\n\nHe said to local media: 'I cannot explain what happened to me at that moment.'\n\nThe rapist was hospitalised to Shevchenko District Hospital and underwent surgery.\n\nSergey Mitrakov, the head of the hospital's surgical unit said: 'The patient needs a long-lasting treatment.'\n\nDoctors have not speculated on the chances to reattach the penis and if the rapist will regain full functionality of the organ.\n\nThe husband faces up to eight years in prison if found guilty while the rapist Dmitry Ivchenko faces up to five years\n\nPolice have launched a criminal case for rape against the rapist and he remains in hospital under police surveillance.\n\nSnizhana Vodolazska, a spokeswoman for Kupiansk Region Police Department said: 'The suspect caught up with his victim near her apartment block and raped her.'\n\nIt is known that Ivchenko is not married and unemployed.\n\nProsecutor Tetiana Vasileva commented: 'The rapist said that he was dumped by his girlfriend a week ago. On the day of the incident, he drank a litre of vodka. He is refusing to say more so far.'\n\nThe female residents of the village have voiced their support for the husband.\n\nHanna Khaustova said: 'Ivchenko tried to hit on me but I told him to stop. Then he said, \"You will regret it\".\n\n'I believe any girl from our village could have become his victim. If he had not done it the rapist would have continued to assault girls.'\n\nThe husband faces up to eight years in prison if found guilty while the rapist Dmitry Ivchenko faces up to five years.\n\nThe rapist's victim requires counselling and a long period of psychological recovery, according to local media.", "description": "Dmitry Ivchenko (pictured), 25, attacked the woman in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and dragged her into bushes to carry out the rape.
