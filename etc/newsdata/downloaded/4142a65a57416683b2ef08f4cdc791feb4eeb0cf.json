REUTERS/Caren Firouz/File Photo\n\nThe woman in the footage is dressed in traditional Pakistani clothes, sitting next to her husband who addresses her in fluent Mandarin, amplifying a message of trans-national love prevailing over differences in language, religion and culture.\n\nThe videos are the latest sign of China\u2019s growing push to build up cultural \u201csoft power\u201d to complement the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the $60 billion infrastructure programme it has launched as part of the Asian giant\u2019s flagship \u201cBelt and Road\u201d project.\n\nOver the past year, China has sent state-owned PTV and other commercial television channels a series of documentaries, dramas and other television programming for free, officials from PTV told Reuters.\n\nExperts say China has been ramping up attempts to win the hearts and minds of citizens in Belt and Road nations through language, traditional media and social media campaigns, echoing the cultural firepower previously wielded by Western nations, which have leveraged everything from language centres to Hollywood and blue jeans to burnish global influence.\n\n\u201cWe have learnt from the experience of the United States, the UK, and other Western countries - but now, it\u2019s time for the world to understand China,\u201d said Chen Xiang, a correspondent coordinating state-run China Radio International\u2019s wide-ranging presence in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cWe want to tell the people the truth about China, what real China is \u2026 through radio programmes, through TV and through other cultural activities we can do this.\u201d\n\nChina is boosting its Mandarin teaching through state-backed language and culture organisations called Confucius Institutes \u2013 Pakistan is home to four with two more Confucius resource centres set to open \u2013 and spreading exposure to its arts and narrative media in a bid to engage everyday Pakistanis.\n\nEarlier this year, PTV World aired its first Chinese cartoon series, titled Three Drops of Blood, following its premier at the government-funded Pakistan National Council of Arts, where the Chinese Embassy rented a large portion of the building to host a China Cultural Centre.\n\nRecent investments in TV and film follow Chinese interest in print media. Launched in 2017, Huashang, the first-ever Chinese language newspaper in Pakistan, now boasts a readership of over 60,000 a week.\n\nWith around 25,000 Pakistanis learning Chinese at home and another 22,000 Pakistani students in China, there is some way to go before Mandarin challenges English in Pakistan, where the legacy of British colonial rule is everywhere.\n\nBut signs of China\u2019s presence are increasingly visible, from expatriate engineers and their families shopping in city centres to a growing number of Chinese tourists visiting the spectacular scenery of Pakistan\u2019s rugged mountainous north. Locals report an increasing appetite to engage using shared cultural touchpoints and language \u2013 sometimes with business in mind.\n\nPAKISTANIS EMBRACING CHINA\n\n\u201cChina is interested in improving its soft power all across the world, \u201c said Dr Kiran Hassan, Research Associate Fellow at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, adding Pakistanis were responding with enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an audience that is ready to receive the Chinese perspective as they feel that China is offering them an economic opportunity.\u201d\n\nAwais Chaudhry moved from his home in the eastern city of Faisalabad to study at a Chinese language institute in Lahore for more than six months, hoping it would help his marketing job.\n\n\u201cChina is our neighbour and a large number of imports is from there, and so with that business point of view, I tried to learn the basics of this language,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nEveryday cultural contacts, while still limited, are expanding, although there is inevitably sometimes a darker side, notably in the periodic scandals over people-trafficking involving Pakistani girls sent to China to be married to men unable to find a wife at home.\n\nHARDER EDGE\n\nThere is a harder edge to some of China\u2019s soft power, notably in its response to criticisms of the Belt and Road initiative as a neo-colonial project, promoting environmentally damaging projects such as coal-fired power plants that benefit Chinese companies more than Pakistan.\n\nMedia and think tank officials from both nations plan to set up a \u201cRapid Response Initiative System\u201d to counter negative perceptions and stop \u201cfake news\u201d about China-Pakistan projects, some of which have garnered increasing scepticism of their economic benefits and criticism of the environmental cost.\n\nRun collaboratively by China Economic Net, a Beijing-based online news organisation, and the Pakistan China Institute, a pro-Beijing Islamabad-based think tank, the system disseminates information to counter negative or \u201cfake\u201d views about CPEC and replace it with a message of a profitable alliance.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take down information, so what we do is give correct information. All media tools are used,\u201d says Mustafa Sayed, Executive Director of the Pakistan China Institute, adding that they spread messages via news anchors, newspapers and Twitter.\n\nIn August Zhao Lijian, China\u2019s then-deputy ambassador to Pakistan, retweeted an article titled \u2018CPEC is dead. Somebody tell Beijing.\u2019\n\n\u201cCongratulations, this report has won the title called \u2018joke of the day\u2019\u201d he wrote in the Tweet. \u201cThe article is pure nonsense, fake news, groundless speculation. This article has become the largest laughing stock in China and Pakistan.\u201d", "description": "In a small office at the Pakistani Television Corporation (PTV) headquarters in Islamabad, producers are preparing to air a video interview of a Pakistani man and his Chinese bride.", "authors": ["Mehr Nadeem", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428620520&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0LB", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
