I've got puppy Ant's favourite toy.'\n\nThe presenters appeared in high spirits when the first canine excitedly rushed outside to greet them\n\nDec watched his best friend try to get his dog to sit while eagerly waiting for his own dog to arrive\n\nThe presenter then turned to his best friend stood beside him and asked: 'You got puppy Dec's favourite toy?' to which Dec responded by pulling out a small squeaky chicken toy from his pocket.\n\nAs the young dogs ran outside to greet the presenters, the two men were left gushing at their playful behaviours.\n\nHowever, Dec was left struggling to control his excited pup and later explained to his best friend that the reason for that may have been due to his dog hailing from a different stock.\n\nAnt immediately set about trying to train his adorable dog and offered the command: 'Sit!'\n\nMeanwhile Dec had a little more difficulty as he tried to control his very playful and excited furry counterpart\n\nDec later told his best friend that Declan was from a different breeding stock and therefore was a 'bit of a stud'\n\nHe later told Ant: 'Do you know there's a slight difference between them. The stock their from. Declan is from breeding stock so he is a bit of a stud.'\n\nThe dogs, who are currently being raised by their Puppy Walkers, volunteers who act as canine foster carers for guide dog pups, will be followed by the public as they embark on their journey to become guide dogs for those living with sight loss.\n\nAnn Bradford, Puppy Walker for puppy Dec said: 'Being a puppy walker is about so much more than walking the puppy, although this is a particularly enjoyable part of the job! It is incredible to be able to give a puppy its first sense of home, nurture its character and help to develop its skills, all the while knowing it will go on to change a life.'\n\nThe Guide Dogs Pups to Partnerships Appeal is taking place from October 1-31 and is hoped to give those living with sight loss in the UK the chance at an independent life.\n\nFor more information on how to get involved, visit: www.guidedogs.org.uk/appeal or call 03451 430 192.", "description": "Ant McPartlin, 43, and Declan Donnelly, met with their adorable canine counterparts for the Pups to Partnership campaign which is aimed at raising funds for more guide dogs in the UK.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/17/19796144-0-image-a-12_1571241976284.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
