But I only have 106.\n\nUnsurprisingly, I never cared much for maintaining LinkedIn profiles and resumes. I got my first freelance writing job when I was still in school, so I never really had to.\n\nSo when I heard of a new AI-tool, developed by top recruiters to boost LinkedIn profiles and resumes, I was curious how it would improve my severely neglected CV.\n\nStartup Resume Worded is an AI-powered platform that provides \u2018tailored feedback\u2019 on your resume and LinkedIn profile. By offering free suggestions on how to improve your resume, it promises to increase your chances of getting hired.\n\nAccording to robots, I should be unemployed\n\nCurious to get my evaluation, I uploaded my resume to the online AI-tool \u2014 and my results were terrible.\n\nOut of 100 achievable points, I only got 26. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of room for improvement on your resume,\u201d bold letters scream from the top of my score sheet.\n\nThe AI scorns me for not including numbers and metrics in my resume; no quantifiable examples of my achievements. According to the tool, using statistics in resumes is essential to land interviews at top companies. For example, Resume Worded suggested I add something like the following:\n\n\n\n\u201cDeveloped and executed customer referral program, leading to a 50 percent increase in referral business and $2MM of incremental revenue.\u201d\n\nI have to admit: I\u2019m impressed with the advice. I\u2019d never thought to quantify my achievements but can imagine it would add credibility to my resume. As a freelance writer, providing some statistics on article views and Facebook comments and likes might help convince editors.\n\nThe other suggestions are considerably less useful. As can be expected with AI, Resume Worded flags my \u201cineffective buzzwords\u201d (such as \u201cteam player\u201d and \u201cresults-driven\u201d) and thinks my resume is too long for my \u201clittle experience.\u201d\n\nObama, your profile needs work\n\nIn addition to resumes, Resume Worded also reviews complete Linkedin profiles. I don\u2019t need an AI to tell me my profile is pretty much worthless, so I test a more impressive one instead: Barack Obama\u2019s LinkedIn page.\n\nResume Worded awards him 61 out of 100 points. \u201cDecent start, but there\u2019s still room for improvement!\u201d it says at the top of his score sheet. Obama\u2019s headline \u2013 Former President of the United States of America \u2013 is the only part of his profile worthy of a compliment. It contains recognizable elements the robot knows from top headlines; it has the right length and contains a minimal amount of buzzwords.\n\nThe rest of Obama\u2019s profile needs work. His summary is too short, while other parts are too long. And the former president should do something about his current job listing, as no current jobs are mentioned on his LinkedIn profile. \u201cEven if you are not currently employed, consider adding a job title which describes what you are looking for. Why? Because most recruiters use the current title box to search for candidates.\u201d\n\nObama should add a \u201cfreelance position\u201d to not appear unemployed.\n\nAI in recruitment\n\nIn some cases, robots are smarter than humans. When we harness AI to detect skin cancer, diagnoses are delivered faster and with more accuracy than human doctors. But when it comes to the job market, I doubt these algorithmically-selected pointers really improve my chances.\n\nCurrently, the tool mainly looks at the number of words per section and the number of buzzwords used. Surely there\u2019s more to a good resume or LinkedIn profile than that?\n\nAccording to Farid van Mastbergen, a recruiter in the field of AI, there definitely is. Human recruiters obviously understand Obama doesn\u2019t need a current job listing to still be employable. \u201cBut an AI-powered platform bases its suggestions on a large number of resumes it has seen.\u201d In other words, humans are better able to filter out and assess exceptions than AI-powered tools.\n\nRobots apply for jobs with robots\n\nResume Worded is a relatively new tool to help job hunters get noticed by recruiters. However, in many HR departments, AI-tools are already being put to use. Some recruiters use an \u2018Applicant Tracking System\u2019 (ATS) that helps with candidate sourcing, the screening of resumes, and the organization of applicant information.\n\nSimilar to how Resume Worded reviews CVs and LinkedIn profiles, these HR technologies look for keywords and quantifiable knowledge that match the company\u2019s hiring criteria. The right resumes are passed onto (human) HR employees and an interview is set up.\n\nAccording to Van Mastbergen, using AI to both write and review resumes, won\u2019t be effective as it doesn\u2019t tell us anything. The robot writers will know exactly what to include to be picked up by robot reviewers, but that doesn\u2019t mean the human candidate is any more suitable for the actual job.\n\n\u201cHuman recruiters know what to ask when they evaluate profiles and resumes. Is the information truthful, is there anything missing? Does the candidate plan to move to another city in the near future, or will they stay put?\n\nStill, there\u2019s definitely a place for machine learning in the future of the job market, Van Mastbergen notes. Once AI is able to make predictions and decisions based on data and experience, rather than performing specifically programmed tasks, the possibilities are endless.\n\nThis will equip robots with better questioning skills and enable them to predict human behavior based on somebody\u2019s personal data. Just like Google knows more about our shopping behavior than we do, future AI may be capable to provide an in-depth assessment if someone is right for the job.\n\nCan we trust robots?\n\nWhile AI is a new frontier for recruitment and HR, the process of landing a job hasn\u2019t changed that much. Employers still look for employees who fit the company\u2019s culture, have the required experience and skills, and are willing to stick around.\n\nThe bigger question is to what extent do we want AI to determine our worth at the job market? Looking at it from a more personal perspective, I will probably take Resume Worded\u2019s suggestion to add some quantifiable achievements. But to be honest, I\u2019m not expecting to get to +500 new LinkedIn invites any time soon.\n\nBy combining a passion for people with the power of today\u2019s intelligent machines, Randstad supports people and organizations in realizing their true potential.
