They dropped another 8% by the end of July 2019.\n\nBy the numbers: Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, the EU and other agricultural producers have all seen their exports to China grow while those of the U.S. have declined.\n\nBrazil's share of China's $38 billion soy import market shot up to 76% in 2o18, while the U.S.' fell from 35% to 19%. Brazil has also taken up 15% of the $2 billion pork market, as the U.S. has dropped from 15% to 6%.\n\nUkraine has capitalized on the trade war to increase its share of China\u2019s $790 million corn market from 61% to 81% through 2018. The U.S. share is down to 9%, from 17%.\n\nCanada, Kazakhstan and Russia gained on China's $780 million in wheat imports at the expense of the U.S., whose market share fell from 38% to 14%.\n\nBetween the lines: With no end in sight for the current trade war, international competitors could secure enduring advantages.\n\nThe U.S. never made up the market share in beef exports it lost to Argentina, Brazil and Australia after a 2003 trade scuffle. Its share dropped from 69% in 2002 to 1% in 2018.\n\nIn the current conflict, China has turned to Brazil for most of its soybean imports, establishing new supplier relationships and incurring other transition costs that will keep Brazil's soybeans competitive even if U.S.\u2013China tariffs are relaxed.\n\nWhat to watch: In announcing last week's limited deal, the White House said China agreed to buy at least $40 billion of U.S. agricultural products, though few details have emerged.\n\nPresidents Trump and Xi are set to meet in November on the margins of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting, where a final agreement on these purchases would likely require clearing other technical and political hurdles.\n\nDecker Walker is a managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group, where he leads the firm\u2019s global agribusiness sector.", "description": "American agricultural exports to China fell 53% in 2018 and another 8% through July.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/4_DXgoCzqm8o28K_4IGn314bOZQ=/0x44:3297x1899/1920x1080/2019/10/18/1571409982146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
