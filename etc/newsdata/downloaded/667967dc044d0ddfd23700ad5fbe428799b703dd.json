From decor to baked goods to friendships with West Coast rappers, Martha Stewart has unparalleled taste. She\u2019s also been around the block, so to speak, having spent five months in a correctional facility after being convicted of insider trading. All this considered, it would be pretty tough to be on the receiving end of Stewart\u2019s criticism, especially if you famously played a (desperate) housewife and also happen to be serving time.\n\nThis is the fate of Felicity Huffman, who was recently photographed rocking a green jump suit while serving her newly truncated 13 day jail sentence for her participation in Operation Varsity Blues. At Vanity Fair\u2019s New Establishment Summit, Stewart was asked if she thought Huffman had learned anything now that she has officially begun her (incredibly short) stint behind bars. Stewart retorted, without skipping a beat, \u201cWell, she should style her outfit a bit more. She looked pretty schlumpy.\u201d An absolutely devastating blow from the bonafide tastemaker.\n\nWhile we\u2019d never be so bold as to go against Martha Stewart, we slightly disagree with her take on Felicity\u2019s jumpsuit. Anyone who\u2019s ever been to Brooklyn knows that Felicity\u2019s prison lewk is serving big \u201cPratt student en route to a sculpture class\u201d energy in the best possible way. But it\u2019s ok, Felicity. In approximately *checks notes* 4 days you will be out of jail and can commiserate with Goop about your new beef with Martha Stewart. Hopefully, Lori Loughlin is somewhere taking notes on what not to wear behind bars.", "description": "In an interview with Vanity Fair, Martha Stewart calls newly incarcerated Felicity Huffman\u2019s jailhouse jumpsuit \u201cschlumpy.\u201d", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/Martha-Stewart-23.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
