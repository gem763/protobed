A parliamentary panel will investigate the allegation.\n\nThe $104.3 million project was 80% funded by Exim Bank of China, with China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CEIEC) and ALIT recommended as the main contractors by Chinese government.\n\nSirisena alleged ALIT in 2016 had vanished, misappropriating some 2 billion rupees deposited with it by Sri Lanka\u2019s state-run Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC).\n\nALIT in a statement said it had left the consortium in August 2015, entrusting its partner CEIEC to act solely on its behalf to fulfil the contract with the TRC.\n\nIt also said the TRC, according to the contract, paid $15.6 million (2 billion rupees) into CEIEC\u2019s account in Exim Bank in October 2012, the same amount to which Sirisena referred to as misappropriated.\n\n\u201cThis sum had been used for the project purpose solely,\u201d ALIT said in a statement, without elaborating how and when the money was spent.\n\nSirisena\u2019s predecessor, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was in power when the alleged incident took place in 2012, has denied any corruption in the deal.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) said on Wednesday it will probe the allegation.\n\nAfter coming to power in 2015, Sirisena suspended most Chinese-backed infrastructure projects started under Rajapaksa, citing allegations of corruption and the flouting of rules.\n\nSirisena\u2019s Lotus Tower allegation comes ahead of a presidential election set for Nov. 16, which Rajapaksa\u2019s brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa is expected to contest.\n\nPolitical sources close to Sirisena and Rajapaksa have said talks between the president\u2019s centre-left Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Rajapaksa\u2019s Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) for a coalition deal have broken down.", "description": "China's state-run Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co (ALIT) on Friday rejected Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena's allegation of misappropriating 2 billion rupees ($11 million) in a deal to work on the construction of South Asia's tallest tower.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
