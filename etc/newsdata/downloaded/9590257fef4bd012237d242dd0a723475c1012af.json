Not Miss Ukraine.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was recalling his days as the owner of the Miss Universe pageant Wednesday as he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made remarks before their private meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing,\u201d he said of his pageant days. \u201cAnd we had a winner from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBut a Ukrainian woman has never won the Miss Universe title.\n\nSeveral made the top 10 during Trump\u2019s tenure at the pageant, which he bought in 1996 and sold in 2015.
