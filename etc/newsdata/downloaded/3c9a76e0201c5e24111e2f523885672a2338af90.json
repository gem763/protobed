The offense, revved by Howie Kendrick in the early innings and boosted by two RBI singles from Victor Robles, tacked on three insurance runs in the last two frames. That followed Rodney retiring the heart of the Cardinals\u2019 order in the seventh, and then Hudson recorded the team\u2019s first save since Aug. 16. The buttons were pressed by bench coach Chip Hale, in his second game filling in for Manager Dave Martinez, who remains in Washington after undergoing a cardiac procedure Monday. And, in a twist, a good process met a good result.\n\n\u201cTry to ride the hot hands,\u201d Hudson said of what the bullpen expects down the stretch. \u201cAnd get these W\u2019s, because we really need them right now with this wild-card race getting so tight.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 urgency has wavered throughout the past 5\u00bd months. When they were 19-31 in mid-May, and it looked like the year might be a total wash, it felt like they had to win every game. In some ways, that was true. But once they got healthy and rebounded, and they started playing like one of baseball\u2019s best clubs, winning became the unlikely expectation. The pressure to do so was gone. It was replaced by a lot of dancing in the dugout.\n\nYet now the stakes are hiked way back up. On Sept. 2, the Nationals had a sturdy, seven-game lead to play in the wild-card game. Even after Tuesday\u2019s victory, things remain tight. The Cubs fell to the Cincinnati Reds to drop 1\u00bd back, and the Brewers are tied with Chicago after beating the San Diego Padres. So if there was ever a time to be urgent, to admit that some contests may really matter more than others, it is right now.\n\n\u201cThe best thing to do is just worry about today,\u201d said Hale, who was both filling in for and sounding very much like Martinez. \u201cWorry about the next pitch and just try to win each pitch and win each game. If you start going, \u2018Whoa, if we lose this game and they win then dot dot dot.\u201d\n\nThe audible dot dot dot came with Hale shaking his head and waving his hands in the air. The dot dot dot is what Washington wants to avoid. The dot dot dot is everything that could happen: losing the wild-card lead, running away with it, playing in a tiebreaker Sept. 30, missing the playoffs entirely, winning every remaining game, losing every remaining game \u2014 you name it. It\u2019s easy to get caught nose-deep in scenarios at this time of year. It\u2019s easy, then, for doubt to set in. But the Nationals\u2019 simple cure, maybe the only cure, is to win and let the rest shake out.\n\nTheir latest attempt at that began with Corbin fooling St. Louis with his slider. That helped him finish with 11 strikeouts, tying a season high, and limit damage despite four walks. He only gave up those two unearned runs in six innings, because of errors by shortstop Trea Turner and catcher Yan Gomes, but the offense was up to erasing them throughout the evening.\n\nKendrick was the first to get it going against Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas. He hit a triple in the second, missing a home run by a few feet, and scored on Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera\u2019s sacrifice fly. Then he got all of a Mikolas curveball in the fourth for his 16th home run. Robles ripped two RBI singles, in the sixth and eighth, to stretch the lead. Juan Soto added a sacrifice fly to score Turner in the ninth. And, all the while, Rodney and Hudson were up for recording the final nine outs.\n\n\u201cPretty much every inning we were thinking about the next one,\u201d Hale said of deciding to push Hudson for two frames, made possible because he needed just 11 pitches in the eighth. \u201cThe word of the night was reconvene. [Pitching coach] Paul [Menhart] kept saying, \u2018We\u2019ll reconvene when the inning ends.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHours before the game, in the dead of a lazy afternoon, the Nationals\u2019 clubhouse was filled with Bob Marley\u2019s greatest hits. The last song to play was \u201cThree Little Birds\u201d \u2014 among Marley\u2019s most famous, mostly for the reminder to \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing . . . \u2019cause every little thing is gonna be all right.\u201d After it ended, and the speakers stopped offering music, Rodney and fellow reliever Wander Suero stood by the showers and offered their own version. Rodney sang those famous two lines in his deep voice. Suero did the same, his range an octave higher, and punctuated it with what sounded like a laugh.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 bullpen hasn\u2019t had much to joke about this season. But here, in a tired metaphor, were off-key reminders that Washington still has the benefit of the next game, and the one after that, and then 10 more before the regular season closes. The relievers were a reason, along with Corbin and the timely offense, that the Nationals still held a slight advantage in the wild-card hunt. They were a reason to put off worrying about the dot dot dot \u2014 at least for another day.", "description": "Patrick Corbin was solid, the bullpen tossed three scoreless innings, and the Chicago Cubs lost, giving the Nationals a lift in the wild-card race.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VDTELSWZYMI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
