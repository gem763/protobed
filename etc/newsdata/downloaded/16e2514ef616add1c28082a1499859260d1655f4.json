I think he will be more confident after Vitoria.\n\n'We are very happy with Pepe and we know we are waiting for more but it is one process and we need patience and to be calm with him.'", "description": "Nicolas Pepe's first match-winning contribution as an Arsenal player against Vitoria was timely and not just for being a late two-goal late cameo that turned defeat into victory.", "authors": ["Adrian Kajumba For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20197628-0-image-a-8_1572036886738.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
