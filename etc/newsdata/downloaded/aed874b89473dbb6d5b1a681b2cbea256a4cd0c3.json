The other has a lower leg injury,' the ambulance service said.\n\nThe pair were taken by boat to the Coral Sea Marina at around 11am, where paramedics treated them.\n\nThey are now being taken to Mackay Hospital by the RACQ CQ Rescue helicopter.\n\nTwo swimmers have been attacked by a shark near Airlie Beach (pictured) in Queensland\n\nThe shocking attack comes 20 days after the removal of drum lines from the Great Barrier Reef following a Federal Court ruling.\n\nQueensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she didn't know if the attack happened in an area where the drumlines were taken out.\n\n'We don't know exactly where it happened, but I'm told they're being brought into Airlie Beach so I'm assuming it's in the Whitsunday region,' she said.\n\n'I'm not going to talk about the politics of drum lines today. My main concern today is for the welfare of these two people that have been injured by what appears to be a shark attack.\n\n'I don't know if they were diving. I don't know if it was off-shore. I don't know if it was outside the marine park.\n\nA total of 27 beaches are now 'at risk' after the lines - traps which lure in and capture sharks with baited hooks - were removed.\n\nThe Whitsundays region has seen a number of different shark attacks in the last year.\n\nDaniel Christidis, 33, from Victoria, was mauled to death at Cid Harbour during a boating trip with friends.\n\nThere were another two shark attacks in the subsequent 24 hours, first on justine Barwick, from Tasmania, and second on Hannah Papps, from Victoria.", "description": "The men, aged in their 30s, were mauled by the shark at 10.22am on Tuesday at Airlie Beach.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/01/20306844-0-image-a-26_1572311540846.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
