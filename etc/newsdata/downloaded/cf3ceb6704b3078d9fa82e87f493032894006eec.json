(Nick Wass)\n\nAfter Labor Day, the gym doors opened and the newest Washington Wizards walked through. The early weeks of September in the NBA may represent the last death crawl of summer before training camp, but rookies and young guys have no rest. They\u2019re supposed to be in the gym. However, by Sept. 3, a strange scene was unfolding: Old heads were taking over the place.\n\nIsaiah Thomas was heckling a first-year player for being late \u2014 for a voluntary workout at 7 a.m.\n\nCJ Miles was shooting three-pointers \u2014 in a walking boot.\n\nAnd Bradley Beal \u2014 if anyone had an excuse to pull a veteran move and stay away it would be him \u2014 was working as hard as a grunt on a non-guaranteed contract, not a two-time all-star sitting on a decision to take a $111 million extension.\n\nFor the new players, these moments became their introduction to Wizards basketball.\n\n\u201cIf the best players work the hardest, everybody\u2019s going to do the same thing and mimic that,\u201d said Moritz Wagner, a second-year pro who was traded to Washington in June. \u201cIt\u2019s like we want to be here, man. We want to be here together and do something. I know no one believes in us but they don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s kind of the mind-set. We don\u2019t need more than we have in this gym, in this locker room.\"\n\n[New GM Tommy Sheppard seeks players who will follow \u2018The Wizards Way\u2019]\n\nWizards\u2019 Culture 2.0\n\nAfter the April firing of Ernie Grunfeld, the longtime president of basketball operations who orchestrated several roster renovations but did not create a culture of consistent accountability through his 16 years, the Wizards needed to reset their environment. New General Manager Tommy Sheppard despises the word \u201cculture\u201d \u2014 to him, it sounds like bacteria growing in a petri dish. Still, change was necessary and though his Wizards are as undefined as gobs of paint on a canvas, the team wants to create a masterpiece.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the mind-set,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said last month.\n\nThey want to win over fans by playing hard every night, even if they\u2019re not winning many games. Over the past few seasons, the Wizards, justifiably, have been accused of not giving consistent effort, of having a talented collection of scorers but ones who didn\u2019t box out, communicate loud enough or give second efforts on defense. Last season, Washington ranked 27th in the NBA in points allowed per 100 possessions (112.9), a telling sign.\n\nAmong active players, only Beal and Ian Mahinmi have been in Washington for longer than one full season. The newbies who have been competing together for over a month, have witnessed nothing but hard work.\n\n\u201cThe biggest focus is just changing our work habits, which will translate to winning habits and, within that, also changing characteristics and things that happen off the floor and within the organization,\u201d rookie Admiral Schofield said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t here [last year], so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but right now, I know we\u2019re going in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards also want value throughout the roster, players who have defined roles: the seventh or eighth man who exceeds his contract, the cerebral player who can come off the bench late in the game and know how to execute the right play, the trade piece who can be a better fit. But more than anything, the Wizards want to establish a sense of professionalism. Not just through coaches and staffers haranguing the millennials about showing up on time, but with veteran peers willingly showing the way.\n\nWith the potential of having eight players 22 years old or younger on the opening night roster, the Wizards need accountability.\n\nIt\u2019s why Sheppard recently had a glint in his eye in retelling the story of Thomas playing time keeper at the front door. And why Schofield was nodding along to every word of instruction delivered by Miles, the 15-year veteran who will miss preseason after having surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left foot, as the pair stood near the top of the three-point arc after a long training camp practice.\n\nLessons are being imparted by the veterans and the cells of a new culture are spreading.\n\n\u201cThe season\u2019s going to go quick and the bench is going shorten and Coach is going to want guys who know what he wants and get it done,\u201d Beal said. \u201cSo, as long as we\u2019re able to keep those good habits up of being on time, being early, getting the work in and then applying it on the court and getting it done, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to.\u201d\n\nChange at the top and all around\n\nSheppard has spent the past six months proving he\u2019s not Grunfeld.\n\nThe perception that he was his former boss\u2019s wing man might have been the biggest obstacle in Sheppard\u2019s candidacy for the job. After all, Sheppard had worked under Grunfeld; though he was virtually unknown to average Wizards fans, anyone associated with the previous regime carried the residue of the past 16 years, when the team averaged just 37.9 wins and had recently fallen into salary cap purgatory thanks to a glut of bloated contracts.\n\nBut Sheppard began asserting his own personality almost immediately upon being named interim GM in early April.\n\n\u201cIf you know Tommy, you know he has a lot of energy,\u201d Mahinmi said. \u201cHe\u2019s very enthusiastic and people are leaning that way. Very enthusiastic and very positive energy.\u201d\n\nSheppard, a former public relations official with the Denver Nuggets and for three Summer Olympics, has been the antithesis to the previous decades in other ways.\n\nAccording to NBA guidelines, teams must open practices to reporters for 15 minutes. In the past, the Wizards mostly showed 15 minutes of players shooting free throws, not actual practice. However, during the opening week of training camp, the Wizards have invited in the gaggle of reporters, largely consisting of Japanese media covering rookie Rui Hachimura, for long stretches of practice time that had once happened behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cHey, we got nothing to hide,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cYou guys know what we want. We want to play hard, we want to play together, we want to play with toughness. We want to get better everyday. We don\u2019t want to play with a bad spirit and that\u2019s what we talked about.\u201d\n\nThe practice reveal seems like a small act. But just like the Labor Day workouts, when the entire roster filled the gym, it lays a bigger foundation of change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s transparent,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cWe open doors.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Wizards want more Thomas Bryants\n\nWizards drill down on the art of passing\n\nBradley Beal, entering the season without John Wall, dismisses the doubters\n\nAdam Silver on NBA\u2019s stricter tampering rules: Fans \u2018were losing confidence in our system\u2019\n\nLeBron James continues fight against NCAA, announcing support of Fair Pay to Play Act\n\nEven with a lift from Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Clippers plan to keep doing the dirty work", "description": "Washington is emphasizing hard work and professionalism in trying to forge a culture shift for a team that has averaged just 37.9 wins over the past 16 seasons.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards.", "October At Pm", "Candace Buckner Covers The Washington Wizards.
