You live far away from government help. So you need to be able to have the freedoms to make decisions ... in your best interests,\" she said.\n\nWhile some Conservative supporters believe the way forward is to get more voters in other parts of Canada, others think their future lies in a separatist movement known as \"Wexit\" \u2014 a portmanteau for Western exit from Canada.\n\nNorthern B.C. Wexit?\n\nAmong those calling for separation is Jay Hill, a former Conservative Party MP for Prince George-Peace River who said voters in his old riding have more in common with their Albertan neighbours than those in and around Vancouver \u2014 including a sense of anger at Trudeau's re-election.\n\nFormer Conservative MP Jay Hill says Alberta, Saskatchwan, and possibly northern B.C., should separate from Canada. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\n\"I know for a fact having represented northeastern British Columbia for 17 years in Parliament that the people up there are pissed,\" he told CBC's As It Happens.\n\nAnd, Hill said, he supports that portion of the province joining Alberta and Saskatchewan in seceding from Canada, a movement now dubbed \"Wexit.\"\n\nThat sentiment was backed by Mackenzie Pollard, an equipment operator in Dawson Creek and the founder of a \"Wexit British Columbia\" Facebook page connected to the \"official\" Wexit Alberta movement led by Peter Downing.\n\n\"Most people who live here have experienced the oil and gas industry [downturn],\" he said. \"It's not that we're throwing a tantrum about it, it's our livelihood.\"\n\nJason Morris, a political science professor at the University of Northern B.C. in Prince George, says he doesn't expect Wexit talk to go far, pointing to past separatist movements such as the Western Canada Concept Party which managed to win one byelection in 1982 before fizzling out.\n\n\"My take is emotions will subside a bit and most Westerners [will] realize there's still a lot that can be done to get better or more enhanced representation with the political system we have,\" he said.\n\n'Stronger together': Conservative MP\n\nCurrent political leaders are less open to talk of separation.\n\n\"As a nation, I think we are stronger together,\" Conservative MP Todd Doherty of Cariboo-Prince George told Daybreak North host Carolina de Ryk.\n\n\"Our job is to make sure as leaders within our country ... that we are doing everything in our power to hold our country together.\"\n\nConservative MP Todd Doherty of Cariboo-Prince George dismissed talk of western separatism, saying Canada is 'stronger together' following the 2019 election. (Todd Doherty)\n\nLikewise, Bob Zimmer of Prince George-Peace River-Northern Rockies said he's willing to work with a minority government so long as it means bringing jobs to his constituents.\n\n\"I think [Justin Trudeau] can show that by developing projects, that he does care about the west,\" Zimmer said.\n\nSubscribe to Daybreak North on CBC Listen or your favourite podcast app, and connect with CBC Northern British Columbia on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nTrudy Klassen of Prince George and Kristi Leer of Fort Nelson discuss the success of the Conservative Party in northeastern and central B.C. and how the party should move forward to get more support in other parts of the country. 10:29\n\nMackenzie Pollard of Dawson Creek, B.C. was frustrated enough with Monday's election results that he created a Facebook group advocating B.C. join Alberta and Saskatchewan in separating from Canada.
