But they can also be a little dark. They can be very aggressive.\n\n'This Halloween is a spooky time for people so I thought it was fun to show a little bit of the more evil side of squirrels.'\n\nGeert captured two squirrels scrambling for the ghoulish pumpkin. In his film clip, an inquisitive squirrel climbs down a tree to get a closer look at the pumpkin\n\nA second squirrel joins in on the fun and the pair of animals later have a tug of war over the sinister pumpkin\n\nHe says the animals sometimes bite him but he has never bled - and since buying a property in central Sweden's mountains he has grown increasingly good at capturing the animals.\n\nHe believes he has filmed around three generations of the woodland creatures in seven years.\n\nAnd because wild squirrels 'do exactly what they want' he can wait a 'very long time' for the perfect picture.\n\nGeert says squirrels can be 'nice and gentle and loving' but also a 'little dark' which he hopes to show in his photos\n\nSome people even think his photos are posed or the squirrels are stuffed.\n\nHe said: 'Almost every picture I take is telling a story. So like with Halloween, I can imagine them as dancing skeletons.'\n\nHe describes his style as 'unique, beautiful and often whimsical' on his website.\n\nHis previous images have included squirrels drinking at a miniature bar and playing cards at a tiny table in his last photo-series.\n\nThe photographer told Lonely Planet the animals are the perfect subject to create 'fantasy worlds'.", "description": "An inquisitive red squirrel was captured poking its head inside a carved pumpkin in a Swedish woodland by photographer Geert Weggen.
