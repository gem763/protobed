REUTERS/STRINGER/File Photo\n\nThe Iran-aligned Houthi movement that controls Yemen\u2019s capital claimed responsibility for the attack, which damaged the world\u2019s biggest crude oil processing plant. Iran denied blame and said it was ready for \u201cfull-fledged war\u201d.\n\nTwo sources briefed on the operations of state oil company Saudi Aramco told Reuters it might take months for Saudi oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks.\n\nOil prices surged by as much as 19% before coming off peaks. The intraday jump was the biggest since the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nPrices eased after Trump announced that he would release U.S. emergency supplies, and producers around the world said there were enough stocks stored up to make up for the shortfall.\n\n\u201cThere is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!\u201d Trump said on Twitter on Sunday.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry pinned the blame squarely on Iran for \u201can attack on the global economy and the global energy market\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe United States wholeheartedly condemns Iran\u2019s attack on Saudi Arabia and we call on other nations to do the same,\u201d he said in a speech to an annual meeting in Vienna of the U.N. nuclear watchdog IAEA. He added that he was confident the oil market \u201cis resilient and will respond positively\u201d.\n\nWhile Iran has denied blame for the attacks, its Yemeni allies have promised more strikes to come. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group carried out Saturday\u2019s pre-dawn attack with drones, including some powered by jet engines.\n\n\u201cWe assure the Saudi regime that our long arm can reach any place we choose and at the time of our choosing,\u201d Sarea tweeted. \u201cWe warn companies and foreigners against being near the plants that we struck because they are still in our sights and could be hit at any moment.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials say they believe that the attacks came from the opposite direction, possibly from Iran itself rather than Yemen, and may have involved cruise missiles. Wherever the attacks were launched, however, they believe Iran is to blame.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there\u2019s no escaping it. There\u2019s no other candidate,\u201d a U.S. official said on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have been enemies for decades and are fighting a number of proxy wars, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting against the Houthis for four years.\n\nTension in the oil-producing Gulf region has dramatically escalated this year after Trump imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its oil exports altogether.\n\nTHREATS\n\nFor months Iranian officials have issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran is blocked from exporting oil, other countries will not be able to do so either. However, Iran has denied any role in specific attacks, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and previous strikes claimed by the Houthis.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi called the U.S. accusations of Iranian involvement in Saturday\u2019s attacks \u201cunacceptable and entirely baseless\u201d.\n\nRussia and China both said it was wrong to jump to hasty conclusions about who was responsible for the attack. Britain also stopped short of ascribing blame but described the assault as a \u201cwanton violation of international law\u201d.\n\nWashington has imposed its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy on Iran since last year when Trump pulled out of an international deal that gave Tehran access to world trade in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nU.S. allies in Europe oppose Trump\u2019s strategy, arguing that it provides no clear mechanism to defuse tensions, creating a risk that the foes could stumble into war.\n\nTrump has said his goal is to force Iran to negotiate a tougher agreement and has left open the possibility of talks with President Hassan Rouhani at an upcoming U.N. meeting. Iran says there can be no talks until Washington lifts sanctions. Its foreign ministry said on Monday Rouhani would not meet Trump.\n\nThe giant Saudi plant that was struck cleans crude oil of impurities, a necessary step before it can be exported and fed into refineries. The attack cut Saudi output by 5.7 million barrels a day, or around half.\n\nSaudi Arabia is not only the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, it has a unique role in the market as the only country with enough spare capacity to increase or decrease its output by millions of barrels per day, keeping the market stable.\n\nBig countries such as the United States and China have reserves designed to handle even a major outage over the short term. But a long outage would make markets subject to swings that could potentially destabilise the global economy.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nRussia and an OPEC source said on Monday there was no need for an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a group known as OPEC+ that has orchestrated a supply-curbing deal.\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters there was enough oil in commercial stockpiles to cover the shortfall.", "description": "An attack on Saudi Arabia that shut 5% of global crude output caused the biggest surge in oil prices since 1991, after U.S. officials blamed Iran and President Donald Trump said Washington was \"locked and loaded\" to retaliate.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Aziz", "El Yaakoubi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430430104&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0L7", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
