An individual of one species cannot, during its lifetime, turn into another species. But your question is so interesting because it helps us think about life, evolution and what it means to be human.\n\nIt is remarkable that despite the extraordinary number and diversity of different species, an adult from one species typically does not produce offspring with the adult of another species (although this is less true of plants, and there are notable animal exceptions).\n\nIn other words, young sulfur-crested cockatoos are produced by a pair of adult sulfur crested cockatoos, not a pair of Major Mitchell\u2019s cockatoos, but also not by a sulfur-crested cockatoo and a Major Mitchell\u2019s cockatoo.\n\nThe same is true for other species that are not so obviously different to us. There are many species of Drosophila fruit flies (the very small flies that are attracted to rotting fruit, especially bananas) that all look very similar.\n\nBut young flies are very rarely produced by males and females of different Drosophila species.\n\nThis observation would lead you to think that species don\u2019t change much, and yet they do and sometimes over quite a short time period (for example, in response to climate change). This raises a very interesting question of how species change, and how new species emerge.\n\nAbout 150 years ago, Charles Darwin provided a very compelling explanation in his book On the Origin of Species. His book was widely criticised at the time, partly because his ideas were not properly understood. For example, some people thought Darwin was suggesting that, over time, apes turned into people.\n\nThe story goes that during a very lively, public debate held a few months after On the Origin of Species was published, the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, unkindly asked Thomas Huxley, a friend of Darwin, whether \u201cit was through his grandfather or his grandmother that he claimed descent from a monkey?\u201d.\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Do animals sleep like people? Do snails sleep in their shells?\n\nThe question misrepresents Darwin\u2019s theory: modern monkeys did not turn into humans, but rather humans and modern monkeys share a common ancestor, which is why there are some similarities between us.\n\nHow different are we from chimpanzees? Analyses of our genes, which carry the information that make us what we are, reveals that chimpanzees, bonobos and humans share a very high proportion of their genes.\n\nIn fact, bonobos and chimpanzees are humans\u2019 closest relatives: the human ancestors split from the chimpanzee ancestors around five to seven million years ago. Bonobos and chimpanzee became two distinct species more recently, about two million years ago.\n\nWe are similar, and some people argue that this similarity is sufficient that chimpanzees should have the same rights as people. But of course we are also very different, and the most obvious difference lies in something that is not usually regarded as biological \u2013 our culture.\n\nSo to return to your original question \u2013 no, chimpanzees don\u2019t (and didn\u2019t) turn into people, but we do share ancestors, who over a very long time became what we now recognise as different species: chimpanzees, bonobos and humans. And that makes chimpanzees and bonobos rather special.\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Why don\u2019t cats wear shoes?\n\nHello, curious kids! Have you got a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer?
