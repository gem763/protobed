It\u2019s also unclear whether Brown\u2019s death was in any way connected to the Guyger\u2019s murder trial. Last Tuesday, Guyger was found guilty of murder, and was subsequently sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nFollowing news of Brown\u2019s death, Dallas County prosecutor Jason Hermus, who led the prosecution team at Guyer\u2019s trial, praised the young man, who was 28, for his courage in testifying at the trial.\n\n\u201cHe bravely came forward to testify when others wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Hermus said in the Daily Mail report. \u201cIf we had more people like him, we would have a better world.\u201d\n\nLee Merritt, the attorney for Botham Jean\u2019s family, has said Brown feared for his life after testifying.\n\n\u201cBrown deserves the same justice he sought to ensure the Jean family,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cThe Dallas County criminal justice system must mobilized to identify his killer and see that he is held accountable for this murder.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Joshua Brown, a key witness in the Botham Jean murder trial, was gunned down outside the same property on Friday in Dallas.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/joshua-brown-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
