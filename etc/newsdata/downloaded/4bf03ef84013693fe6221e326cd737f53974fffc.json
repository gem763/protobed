For what? Who gains from that? Not my people. I just couldn\u2019t be a sellout. I couldn\u2019t be an enabler.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things within that organization that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE Rihanna Reportedly Refused Super Bowl Halftime Show In Support Of Kaepernick\n\nRiRi wasn\u2019t the only one to refuse the big show this year, reports came through that Cardi B also turned down the half time slot, and it ended up being this very weird performance from Maroon 5, Big Boi, and Travis Scott. From memory, I think I sat at my desk watching the show with a look on my face like I\u2019d just walked through a fresh fart.\n\nThe big chat with Vogue naturally touched on what she\u2019s working on at the moment, which includes some kind of collab with Lil Nas X (who she met at the BET Awards this year), and that promised ninth Rihanna album, known only as \u2018R9\u2019 for now. I mean she said it\u2019d be here in 2019 and it\u2019s October so, when? When I get it? Rihanna pls I need.\n\nOh, and she apparently put down a US patent for \u2018Fenty Skin\u2019 earlier this year which is, yes. Big yes. Fenty skincare? Absolutely slather me up in those precious oils, creams, serums, whatever it is that makes your skin look so perfect and flawless, Rihanna. Literally take all of my money.", "description": "In her cover story for Vogue's November issue, Rihanna says she refused the Super Bowl gig because she doesn't agree with things within the NFL.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/rihanna-2019-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
