The United States has held off its tariff hike on Chinese products in exchange of a deal that China will buy more farm products and enter into a currency pact.\n\nFinally, trade bellwethers and specially companies that have been deeply affected by the trade war see some silver lining. As the markets rallied on Oct 11 we have shortlisted five stocks that can boost your portfolio.\n\nA Substantial Phase One Deal\n\nAfter nearly two years of trade tussle and slapping of higher tariffs on each other, both the United States and China reached an initial agreement on Oct 11. The \u201cPhase One\u201d \u2014 as termed by both countries \u2014 includes a substantial increase in U.S. agricultural product purchase by China worth between $40 billion and $50 billion. The United States in exchange would hold off tariff hikes that were supposed to be effective from Oct 15.\n\nPresident Donald Trump met Chinese vice premier Liu He in the White House and said that the phase one will be signed in the next three weeks and it will address issues over intellectual property and financial services along with agricultural trade. However, Trump also mentioned that \u201cPhase two will start almost immediately.\u201d\n\nThe cancellation of tariff hike and sales of more agricultural products have led farmers and investors heave a sigh of relief . Big tech shares that were impacted deeply due to the U.S.-Sino trade war cheered up on the news and pushed the S&P 500 Technology Select Sector up by 1.3%.\n\nThe billions of dollars worth of tariff hike and blacklisting of Chinese companies had impacted the retail and semiconductor sectors, with trade bellwethers like Caterpillar Inc. CAT dropping to an all-time low. But Caterpillar\u2019s shares rose 4.7% after the initial agreement news came out.\n\n5 Stocks to Buy\n\nWith phase one in implementation, markets seem to move toward newer highs. The Dow and the S&P 500 rose more than 1% on Oct 11.
