Gen. Richard Ross Coffman, director of the Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team, told Breaking Defense reporter Sydney Freedberg, Jr. \u201cWe are adjusting our expectations.\u201d\n\nAfter reviewing the unmanned ground vehicle demonstrators that companies are developing for various Army requirements, Coffman told Freedberg he was impressed by the levels of autonomy and modularity.\n\n\u201cOverall, the robots are about two years more sophisticated than expected,\u201d Freedberg wrote, citing Coffman. \u201cCapabilities the service expected in 2023 are now potentially achievable in 2021.\u201d\n\nBetween 2020 and 2023 the Army hopes to test three classes of UGV. The Remote Combat Vehicle Light would weigh around 10 tons and come armed with machine guns or rockets in the class of the Javelin anti-tank missile.\n\nThe RCV Medium would weigh around 12 tons and carry a 30-millimeter cannon or similar weapons, essentially matching the armament of a manned M-2 infantry fighting vehicle.\n\nThe RCV Heavy would be a robotic tank, albeit a lightweight one. Weighing around 20 tons, an RCV Heavy could pack a 120-millimeter main gun.\n\nSeveral defense firms plan to debut their UGV designs at the Association of the U.S. Army trade show in Washington, D.C. in late October 2019. Vehicle-maker Textron revealed its own Ripsaw M5 UGV, a robotic light tank, in advance of the show.\n\nThe Ripsaw could meet the Army\u2019s RCV Light and Medium requirements. The tracked, turreted vehicle \u201cis intended to perform various missions including convoy protection, perimeter defense, surveillance, rescue, border patrol, crowd control and explosive ordnance disposal,\u201d Textron stated.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The U.S. Army future robotic army is taking shape faster, and better, than some officials expected.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TfkWpPt2Qds_zVdEx1vbdg--~B/aD05MDU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/aea3bb5ebb793ebd642248ee3abe5474", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
