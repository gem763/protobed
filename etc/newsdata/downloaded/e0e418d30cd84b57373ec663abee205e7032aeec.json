He had a falling out with then fellow Super Rugby coaches Robbie Fleck and Paul Feeney, but then, surprisingly, looked to have been rewarded \u2013 or placated \u2013 with the new role of performance and innovation manager in March.\n\nNow it has emerged that when the former Blitzbok and SWD Eagles winger\u2019s contract expires next month, he will be one of several people, ironically including Fleck, Feeney and forwards coach Russell Winter, whose contracts were not renewed by the provincial union \u2013 only six months into his new role.\n\nMost observers would look at that outcome and put two and two together, but Western Province chief executive Paul Zacks this week insisted that this wasn\u2019t a case of delayed payback, but rather that finances dictated that they make the call.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as Winter, Fleck and Feeney, you know ... contracts come to an end and there\u2019s a new [Stormers] management team in place \u2013 it\u2019s nothing more than that,\u201d explained Zacks.\n\nAt the time, Treu\u2019s new role was hailed by Province as having been created to \u201csupplement\u201d their revamped coaching structures and being \u201cin line with international best practice\u201d.\n\nBut Zacks said that, despite the title having the word \u2018innovative\u2019 in it, it was hardly a new portfolio and it wasn\u2019t a deal that extended beyond the length of Treu\u2019s contract.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a new position as such,\u201d he said.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that all the franchises are struggling financially\n\n\u201cIt was an attempt to see what innovation we could bring to the business. Obviously, Paul did some work for us there around performance management systems, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s a business decision in terms of what we can financially afford.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that all the franchises are struggling financially and, as a result, we had to rationalise the rugby department. The board and executive committee made that decision and, unfortunately, the outcome is the one we\u2019ve arrived at,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd this doesn\u2019t just apply to Feeney. Fleck\u2019s been in our system for 20 years \u2013 10 as a player and 10 as a coach \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of intellectual property, but, financially, we just couldn\u2019t afford it. It\u2019s not a personal decision at all, it\u2019s purely business and purely financial, and about the new head coach being allowed to appoint his own management team.\u201d\n\nA Province insider made their financial situation sound dire, saying that they had gone from having 150-odd contracted players to about 70, including Under-21 players. He also said they would be relying on freelance coaches to coach junior teams such as the Under-21s and the SuperSport Rugby Challenge.\n\nThat said, another insider suggested that Treu could still stay on in a role that has yet to be defined. According to the source, the Western Province politics are such that Treu is not popular with the board but has support in the executive committee, which includes president Zelt Marais.\n\nRead: Chester Williams\u2019 sudden death: Rugby world mourns The Black Pearl\n\nConsequently, it sounds as though a fair bit of water needs to go under the bridge before Treu finally parts ways with Province.\n\nTreu, Fleck, Feeney and Winter not having their contracts renewed comes in the wake of the Lions doing the same with Joey Mongalo and Bart Schoeman in what seems to be a countrywide bid to cut expenses down to the bone.\n\nQuite what that will mean for the franchises\u2019 performances especially considering that Treu\u2019s role was supposed to provide a scientific and research-based sounding board to the coaches at the coalface \u2013 is a mystery.\n\nTreu would not comment when contacted because he is still working for Western Province.", "description": "Chief executive Zacks insists that, just like other franchises, they are cutting costs.", "authors": ["Simnikiwe Xabanisa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9284/531ca747b22946a2af662e8d0bc310c9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
