It also has a higher sales revenue per capita generated by the green economy than China or any country in the OECD or G-20, the study said.\n\nBut other nations are catching up and looking to capitalize on the potential. To remain competitive, the United States will have to develop energy, environment and education policies that support growth in areas like renewable energy.\n\nTo arrive at their conclusions, Maslin and Georgeson focused on low carbon industries such as electric vehicles and energy management in buildings. They complied public and private data \u2014 often at a granular level \u2014 and then used data triangulation to synthesize the different data sets and samples.\n\nTo put the numbers from the study in context, the 9.5 million jobs represents over 4% of the working age population in the United States, while $1.3 trillion is a little under 7% of annual GDP.\n\nEstimating the impact of the green economy in the United States is challenging. Not only is there a broad and varied definition of what constitutes \"green,\" but there's also no official data collected by the government. The Bureau of Labor Statistics used to publish a \"Green Goods and Services\" survey, but it was discontinued in 2013 following budget cuts.\n\nThe researchers said their methodology \"can estimate the sales and employment in the green economy, the share of the country's economy taken up by the green economy, growth in the green economy and the green economy sectors that are leading that growth.\"\n\nInnovation and technological advancements are often at the forefront of the green economy, but the researchers only included industries where there was a measurable economic impact.\n\nThe United States' green economy grew 20% from 2013 to 2016, and that number is projected to keep rising as the battle to fight climate change accelerates. But the rest of the world is catching up, and the United States will need to enact new policies to safeguard the millions of Americans who depend on the burgeoning space, the researchers argued.\n\n\"To safeguard US economic development and job creation, we suggest that economic, environmental and education policies need to be developed to support the US green economy in the context of global developments in the green economy.\"", "description": "The \"green economy\" in America employs more than 9.5 million people, according to the University College London study.", "authors": ["Pippa Stevens"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106057115-1564753737293gettyimages-812546100.jpeg?v=1564753770", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
