The energy company had been under investigation in Ukraine, though there is no evidence that the investigation involved Hunter or that former Vice President Biden's push for Shokin to be removed had anything to do with the investigation.\n\nGiuliani is reportedly under scrutiny over his ties to Ukraine that could place him in legal jeopardy for potentially violating federal campaign-finance laws, according to legal experts.
