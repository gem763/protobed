To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me.\"\n\nIt's little wonder that Mary was so close at hand when Freddie slipped away, watched on by close friend Dave Clark.\n\nDave - lead singer of the Dave Clark Five - was by Freddie's side as he took his last breath.\n\n\"I was with him at his house right at the end,\" he told the Daily Mail in 2008.\n\n\"The doctors had left, and we knew it was only a matter of time. We were alone, and when he passed away, I went downstairs to tell Phoebe, his PA, and Joe, his chef.\n\n(Image: Richard Young/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"His former girlfriend, Mary Austin, came over, and I phoned Freddie's parents to break the news. He looked at peace. But it was such a waste.\"\n\nEmotional Dave went on: \"He gave so much, but he had so much more to give.\"\n\nFreddie was notoriously shy in real life, especially around people he didn't know, but cultivated a flamboyant stage presence and basked in adoration from his fans.\n\n\"There were two sides to Freddie. There was the performer who was larger than life - the bigger the audience, the better. And there was the other side,\" Dave added at the time.\n\n\"He was the most caring person. He was very honest with Mary when he decided to come out and admit he was gay. Their relationship always remained strong.\"\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n(Image: EX)\n\nMary was even tasked with finding Freddie a fitting final resting place after his cremation, which was one of his last ever requests.\n\nShe alone was asked to lay him to rest in a hidden grave, out of Freddie's fear he could be targeted by vandals or obsessive fans.\n\nAnd for more than 20 years, Mary has never revealed Freddie Mercury's final resting place out of respect for the man she loved so deeply.\n\nTo ensure she would remain financially secure for the rest of her life, Freddie also gifted Mary a share of the profits from his future record sales.\n\nShe has since admitted that the charismatic singer \"chose his time to die\".\n\n(Image: Alan Davidson/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nMary once said: \"He knew it was coming. The quality of his life had changed so dramatically and he was in more pain every day.\n\n\u201cHe was losing his sight. His body became weaker as he suffered mild fits. It was so distressing to see him deteriorating in this way.\"\n\nBut Mary, who still lives in the home given to her by the late star, says Freddie was \"peaceful\" at the end and \"died with a smile on his face\".\n\nShe took her vow to her former partner so seriously that not even his parents know where his ashes are.", "description": "Queen frontman Freddie Mercury died of complications from his battle with Aids in November 1991 - but only his close circle of friends knew the end was coming", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Getty Images", "Richard Young Rex Shutterstock", "Mirrorpix", "Ex", "Alan Davidson Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11547935.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Queen-Perform-At-Madison-Square-Garden-July-27-1983.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
