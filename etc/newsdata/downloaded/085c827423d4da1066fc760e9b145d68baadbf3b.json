That suggests shareholders think it highly unlikely the bid will succeed.\n\nRead more\n\nCity stunned as Hong Kong makes \u00a332bn bid for London Stock Exchange\n\nUBS said in a note to clients: \u201cThere are only few instances of cross-continental exchange mergers that have been completed successfully, as nationalist concerns often arise.\u201d The bank would be \u201csurprised to see LSE\u2019s management and board prefer a takeover bid from HKEX\u201d ahead of its own deal to buy Refinitiv, unveiled last month.\n\nHong Kong needs to make a formal offer within 28 days, or walk away. It does not seem to have had any encouragement from the LSE to proceed.\n\nFormer LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet said American watchdogs are likely to raise concerns. He said: \u201cOne issue is the LSE clears about 90% of the US domestic market for interest rate swaps and it is co-regulated by the Bank of England and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u201d\n\nA Government spokesman said: \u201cThe London Stock Exchange is a critically important part of the UK financial system, so as you would expect, the Government and the regulators will be looking at the details closely.\u201d\n\nSome City figures say officials would see any Hong Kong deal as a takeover by China. \u201cThey are asking LSE shareholders to hold paper in a Hong Kong business,\u201d said one. \u201cThe market reaction is fairly clear.\u201d\n\nIn theory, the HKEX deal would create a powerhouse to compete with US rivals such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and CME Group. Either could launch a rival bid for the LSE, though.\n\nRead more\n\nComment: Hong Kong's stunning deal for LSE may never happen\n\nStory continues", "description": "Serious doubts about Hong Kong\u2019s \u00a332 billion offer for the London Stock Exchange grew on Thursday just one day after the daring bid emerged.Investors say the deal could fail over price, regulatory and political concerns even in the unlikely event that the LSE\u2019s management backed the offer.", "authors": ["Simon English"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3RYGiGk0JU8eX7VNHrCFjA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/6c9a9af48a0bbf932b122955411b7921"}
