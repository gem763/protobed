That's sort of a new thing thrown at the market.\"\n\nYet the market doesn't appear to be showing signs of jitters yet. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 hit all-time highs for the second day in row. Plus, the Dow is less than 1.5% from its record high.\n\nBoockvar, who's also a CNBC contributor, cites a news cycle that's still upbeat.\n\n\"All news has been good news for stocks over the past month,\" Boockvar said.\n\nDisclaimer", "description": "Bleakley Advisory Group's Peter Boockvar says the market is running out of upside catalysts.", "authors": ["Stephanie Landsman"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106211029-1572381137817gettyimages-155050856.jpeg?v=1572381233", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
