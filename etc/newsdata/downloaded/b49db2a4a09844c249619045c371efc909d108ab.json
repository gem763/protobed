This roaring pride of lions will give you goosebumps", "language": "en", "text": "YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nGood morning! This wildlife video will have you roaring for the day ahead in no time.\n\n\n\nShared by German tourist Mareiike Bouvie, a 27-year-old, avid solo traveller, after she recently spent four days in the Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga.\n\n\"You need to listen to this with the sound on,\" says Mareiike. She says the roaring went on for ages, describing it how it gave her goose bumps all over. The scene played out close to Malelane Gate.\n\n\"It was the most intense feeling standing (well not literally, she was in a car) next to these guys at 5:30 in the morning.\"\n\nBut this was not the only incredible scene she experienced that day.\n\n\"I saw everything and was so blessed with what I saw. So many leopards and lions... a hyena sighting with wild dogs and the ellies and rhinos at one spot.\"\n\nFor Mareiike her love of nature and wildlife began in her early twenties when she did volunteer work.\n\n\"Now I just wanted to do adventures on my own. It is fantastic. You learn so much about yourself and grow with it.\"\n\nBut Mareiike says the past four-day experience won't be her last - with plans to visit Kruger very soon already hatching.\n\nAnd if there is one piece of advice she could offer would be solo, safari travellers it would be to \"experience the park on your own, it won't disappoint you at all\".\n\n\"Go and rent a car and be open to do this on your own,\" she says.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
