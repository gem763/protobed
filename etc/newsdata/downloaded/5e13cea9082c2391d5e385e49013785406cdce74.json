Whether you like it or not, somehow I\u2019m going to eventually get you to cover it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s far from clear that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s argument \u2014 that a whistle-blower complaint filed by an intelligence official against Mr. Trump will \u201cturn out to be even stupider than Papadopoulos\u201d \u2014 will prevail. Mr. Trump, according to multiple sources, pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and urging him to work with Mr. Giuliani on such an inquiry. Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have denied discussing the former mayor\u2019s contacts with Ukranian officials.\n\nMr. Giuliani described his 28 minutes of cross talk with Mr. Cuomo on Thursday night as \u201cpretty rough.\u201d During the exchange, Mr. Giuliani said he had no idea whether Mr. Trump spoke with the Ukrainian president about Mr. Biden, or Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. But if he did, Mr. Giuliani said, \u201che had every right to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a platform to get that out,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cThe platform requires them beating me over the head.\u201d If that meant he had to sustain some blows, he said, so be it.\n\nMr. Giuliani said he was flooded with responses to his interview, calling it his \u201cbest appearance on television,\u201d and noting that he \u201claid out the hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani said that enduring Mr. Cuomo\u2019s aggressive questioning was the price he was willing to pay to give voice to his claims that the Obama White House asked the Ukrainians to \u201cdig up dirt\u201d on Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to the president about it before,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk to him about it after. I won\u2019t tell you if I talked to him about it today, or not.\u201d", "description": "Mr. Giuliani\u2019s unconstrained television appearances have long raised concerns with the rest of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, as well as White House officials.", "authors": ["Annie Karni", "Maggie Haberman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/20/us/politics/20dc-rudy/20dc-rudy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
