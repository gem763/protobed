Obama quietly prosecuted them.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Democrats have blasted Trump for lambasting intelligence community information leakers that triggered House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as spies.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters that Trump\u2019s attack on the CIA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d that triggered the impeachment investigation is unacceptable.\n\nTrump\u2019s comparison of the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d source as a \u201cspy\u201d amounts to an \u201cincitement of violence,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nIn a joint press conference with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Schiff added that Trump wants to characterize the whistleblower as \u201ctreasonous,\u201d adding:\n\nLet\u2019s not make a mistake here, the president wants to make this all about the whistleblower and suggest that people come forward with evidence of his wrongdoing are somehow treasonous and should be treated as traitors and spies.\n\nSchiff, who came into office in 2013, has been silent about Obama using the Espionage Act to target whistleblowers.\n\nIndividuals prosecuted under Obama include U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\n\nIn May 2017, the government released Manning after serving only seven out of a 35-year sentence for leaking thousands of military and U.S. Department of State documents to WikiLeaks in 2010.\n\nObama also used the Espionage Act to charge Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, who remains in Russia.\n\nUnder Obama, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) targeted whistleblowers for leaking information to journalists and even attempted to prosecute the reporters who received and published the data.\n\nThe Washington Times pointed out:\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s Department of Justice and FBI spied on The Associated Press, secretly wading through their reporters\u2019 phone records, in an effort to chill potential federal whistleblowers. His administration targeted Fox News reporter James Rosen as a criminal co-conspirator under the Espionage Act for simply talking to one of his sources in the State Department and reporting on it.\n\nNear the end of his administration, it appeared the former president had a change of heart and showed an interest in protecting government whistleblowers and other official leakers.\n\nHe implemented executive-branch directives and signed a bill into law to protect whistleblowers and members of the inspector general community.", "description": "The Obama administration waged war on whistleblowers, reportedly prosecuting at least eight leakers under the Espionage Act.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1140810621b-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
