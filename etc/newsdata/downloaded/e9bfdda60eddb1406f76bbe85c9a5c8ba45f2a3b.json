Bennett was also one of the chief protesters starting in the 2016 season. But now that the Cowboys traded for Bennett just ahead of the NFL trade deadline, the question is: Did the team trade for Bennett\u2019s protests, too?\n\nThe Cowboys coach was recently asked about Bennett and his past three seasons of protesting during the anthem. And it seems that Garrett thinks Bennett will end his anthem protest. During a presser, Garrett was asked about Bennett and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate that being an issue. We\u2019re excited to have him here. \u2026 We anticipate him doing what all of players do.\u201d\n\nNew Cowboys DE Michael Bennett stayed in locker room during pregame national anthem this season with Patriots.

Jones expects his players to respect the anthem. \u201cOur policy is that you stand at the anthem, toe on the line,\u201d Jones said in July of 2018.\n\nWe\u2019ll soon find out. After all, the season is well under way.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.", "description": "Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett seems to expect that the team's newly acquired defensive end Michael Bennett will stop his", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images_Dylan-Buell-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
