Those two countries hold 83% of the world\u2019s unicorns. When combining India, which came in at third place with 21 and the UK in fourth with 13, those four countries hold 90% of the globe\u2019s unicorns.\n\n\u201cWe have found just under 500 unicorns in the world. China and the USA dominate with over 80% of the world\u2019s known unicorns, despite representing only half of the world\u2019s GDP and a quarter of the world\u2019s population. The rest of the world needs to wake up to creating an environment that allows unicorns to flourish in,\u201d said Hurun Report Chairman and Chief Researcher Rupert Hoogewerf.\n\nIn total, the 494 unicorns around the world were spread across 24 countries, 118 cities, and are collectively worth $1.7 trillion in total. Each unicorn is worth around $3.4bn on average.\n\nHere is the full list:\n\nTable: Hurun Institute/Yahoo Finance More\n\nThe unicorns are also spread out across a number of industries. E-commerce came out as number one while fintech followed closely behind in terms of the number of unicorns in that industry. Hurun pointed out that while Amazon (AMZN) is known for dominating the e-commerce industry, there are number of startups that are competing for this space \u2014 most coming from Asia.\n\nIn South Korea, Coupang is the largest online retailer while CARS from China have $9bn valuations. Meicai from China and Indonesia\u2019s Tokopedia are also worth $7bn.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Google has set up a global accelerator for startups\n\nHowever, fintech unicorns account for the largest slice of the total value of these firms. The top five industries make up half of the total and Hoogewerf says, \u201cthese are the industries that are disrupting the world economy, initiating the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and widely considered to hold the key to the future. Not surprising that many of the world\u2019s top young talent want to work in these sectors.\u201d\n\nTable: Hurun Institute/Yahoo Finance More\n\nREAD MORE: Revolut to launch in US with Mastercard", "description": "Unicorns are privately-held startup businesses valued at  $1bn (\u00a3771m) or more.", "authors": ["Lianna Brinded", "Head Of Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TG0CA9XzBglU9pp.wxhIWw--~B/aD0zMjY0O3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/468ceda0-f49b-11e9-bfef-696e901fd02c", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
