She crashed into the right-hand shoulder of the trailer and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\n\u201cI see the whole top of that guy\u2019s trailer. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was like, \u2018Wow!\u2019 \u201d San Joaquin County resident Eric Mello told KCRA. \u201cI feel bad for the driver and the families. It\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol confirms the incident to PEOPLE, saying that troopers responded to the scene around 2:15 p.m. CHP spokesperson Ruben Jones says the woman\u2019s parachute was open when they arrived at the scene. He says authorities have \u201cno idea\u201d what could have caused the crash.\n\nA spokesperson for the San Joaquin County Coroner\u2019s Office says the office has not been able to identify the woman or get in touch with her family. However, Jones says the woman was from Colombia.\n\nConditions were windy and one witness told KCRA her father and brother saw the crash while traveling north on the highway.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really traumatized by what they saw right now, and my dad said he never wants to see anything like that again,\u201d Lisa Reyes told KCRA.\n\nRELATED: Woman Miraculously Survives 5,000-Foot Fall After Her Parachute Fails to Open While Skydiving\n\n\u201cThe way the person was struggling, just struggling against the wind and their body was just moving really, really fast,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s what really kind of got [to] him.\u201d\n\nThe deceased and a group of seven people took off from the Lodi Parachute Center that afternoon, and the six others survived, CNN reported.\n\nSeveral drivers told KCRA that they often see parachutists swerving over the highway before landing safely in a large, grassy area nearby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very safe,\u201d Rick Costa said.\n\nJeff Skadburg added: \u201cIt\u2019s a weird place to have the drop zone, I would say. You see them coming down and someone always swings around and it looks like they\u2019re gonna land on the freeway and they don\u2019t \u2014 normally.\u201d\n\nOfficials with Lodi Parachute Center declined to comment, but have scheduled a news conference for 10 a.m. PT.", "description": "Skydiver, 28, Dead After Crashing Into Big Rig on California Highway", "authors": ["Char Adams"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/20m1cl4PkXXqHAf.pZaTsg--~B/aD0xMzM3O3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/5c06a94f7fdbee65d0cb9c9d46e63886", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
