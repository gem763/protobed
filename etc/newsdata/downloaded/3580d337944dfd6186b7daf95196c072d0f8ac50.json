(For context, Netflix Inc. NFLX, +1.72% currently has 158 million paying subscribers globally.) Her model implies that 10% of Apple users choose to pay for the service by fiscal 2025, which is about what she expects for the Apple Music service as well.\n\nAs Apple TV+ becomes more prominent, Huberty sees the company stepping up content spending to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2025 from an estimated $401 million in fiscal 2020. This will dilute Apple\u2019s services gross margins, but she estimates that the increased services revenue base will more than make up for that dilution, so that gross profit dollars rise by an average of 2.5% between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2023.\n\nIn thinking about how Apple will account for the one-year free trial of Apple TV+ that it\u2019s giving those who purchase new devices, Huberty calculates that the company will have to defer about $57 for each iPhone sold to those that the company expects to take advantage of the deal. That would have to be amortized as Apple TV+ services revenue for the year the trial is active. She also assumes that the company will choose to amortize content costs as cost of goods sold for the services segment over three years.\n\nHuberty sees Apple TV+ becoming accretive to earnings starting in fiscal 2021.\n\nSee also: Netflix sells $2.2 billion of junk bonds as it braces for onslaught of competition\n\nApple shares are up 1% in Wednesday trading and on track for a new record high, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.17% is off 0.1%. The stock has risen 57% so far this year, as the Dow has added 15%.", "description": "Optimism about Apple Inc.\u2019s new streaming service has Morgan Stanley feeling increasingly bullish about the company\u2019s prospects.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HG343_applet_ZG_20190325171251.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
