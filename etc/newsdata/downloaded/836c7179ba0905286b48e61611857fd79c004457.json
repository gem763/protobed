(Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)\n\nKansas knocked off Texas Tech in one of the most bizarre endings you will ever see.\n\nThe Jayhawks overcame a 27-14 second half deficit, rallying to tie the game at 34-34 with 5:12 to play. And after forcing the Red Raiders to go three-and-out, Kansas regained possession with a chance to win with 3:12 to play.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nQuarterback Carter Stanley was able to move the Jayhawks deep into Texas Tech territory, setting up a 40-yard field goal try for Liam Jones with 13 seconds to play. Entering Saturday night, Jones was only 1-of-4 on field goal tries of 40 or more yards in 2019, so it was no sure thing. And sure enough, Texas Tech swooped in to block Jones\u2019 try.\n\nThe ball popped up in the air and was corralled by Texas Tech\u2019s Douglas Coleman. As the clock ticked toward zero, Coleman tried to set up a return only to inexplicably pitch the ball backward toward nobody. Kansas then was able to pounce on the loose ball with two seconds remaining.\n\n(via FS1)\n\nThat allowed the Jayhawks to try yet another field goal \u2014 this time from just 32 yards. Les Miles\u2019 group was quickly able to patch up its protection issues and Jones knocked it through for the game-winner.\n\n(via FS1)\n\nWhat a weird finish \u2014 but it didn\u2019t stop Kansas from celebrating accordingly.\n\n(via FS1)\n\nThe win is Kansas\u2019 first over a Big 12 opponent under Miles and just the program\u2019s seventh Big 12 win since 2008.\n\nNow 3-5 on the year, Kansas has four games left in the season to reach the four-win mark. Kansas hasn\u2019t won four games in a season since 2009, Mark Mangino\u2019s last season in Lawrence. Miles, however, undoubtedly has his sights set much higher for his program than just four wins.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Kansas knocked off Texas Tech in one of the most bizarre endings you will ever see.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nVFDzkb45zhNJ618v6_4wg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NzAuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UVfECBSsWXkQmSGlPipvpw--~B/aD0zNTAzO3c9NTE1MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/140f5d00-f864-11e9-9b7f-12106c19cb51", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
