Access Now is a major human rights organization that regularly works with the United Nations, pushes back against authoritarian governments, and protects activists all over the world. It is, simply put, a hugely influential force for good in the battle to protect the human rights of people all over the world.\n\nThat it is now involved in the Blizzard controversy indicates just how badly the company has screwed up here, and the level of pressure that the community and anti-censorship activists are going to apply against it.", "description": "\"By penalizing a player for speaking up in support of protesters exercising their right to freedom of expression, Blizzard demonstrates a lack of respect for the human rights of its users.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da0f3c76b1388000aad616c/lede/1570830034570-30216690703_9f488ddf69_k.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8298xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
