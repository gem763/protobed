Had it not been for his nimble awareness, it could have easily ended in disaster.\n\nThe Brit, who finished third behind Sebastian Vettel and winner Valtteri Bottas, was furious with Leclerc's decision to stay out on the track.\n\nLeclerc stayed out on the tracks despite damaging his car in earlier crash with Max Verstappen\n\nRed Bull driver Verstappen described Leclerc's driving on Sunday as 'irresponsible'\n\n'How he's not been given a warning flag I don't know. [He's] Lost a wing mirror,' he fumed afterwards.\n\nVerstappen also blasted Leclerc after the race, adding: 'I like hard racing, but I don't think this was hard racing, I think it was irresponsible driving into turn two. He had a bad start so for sure he was trying to recover places but there's only so much you can do. It's a shame that it happens.'\n\nLeclerc has been penalised by the FIA following an investigation into the incident and received a 15-second time penalty, which resulted in him being demoted to seventh.\n\nHamilton, meanwhile, remains 44 points ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Bottas in the Drivers' Championship standing going into the final four races of the season.", "description": "Hamilton narrowly avoided being struck by a huge piece of debris from Leclerc's Ferrari, which broke off after the front wing of his car was damaged in a collision on first lap of Sunday's race.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/12/19738172-0-image-a-38_1571139302406.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
