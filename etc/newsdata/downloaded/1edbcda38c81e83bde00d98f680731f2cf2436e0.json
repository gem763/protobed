He was accused of giving 7 billion won ($5.9 million) to a nonprofit foundation controlled by Choi in order to win a lucrative duty-free deal.Shin was jailed after the initial conviction in February 2018. The Seoul Central District Court sentenced him to two years and six months in prison and detained him in the courtroom immediately after sentencing. The court also fined Shin 7 billion won.An appeals court, however, freed him from prison in October last year, handing down a suspended prison term and canceling the 7 billion won fine.Although it found Shin guilty of bribery, the Seoul High Court said his offering of bribes was a passive act. \u201cThe president demanded the money first, so he passively accepted,\u201d the court said at the time. \u201cIt is hard to hold him entirely accountable for giving the bribes when his freedom in decision-making was restricted,\u201d the court said.Shin was released from jail after 234 days.BY SER MYO-JA ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/17150801.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
