Apple has thrown a new iPad into the mix with the announcement of the 10.2 iPad for 2019.\n\nAt first glance, it seems to offer the best value \u2013 an up-to-date iPad that costs a mere \u00a3349 and works with Apple\u2019s first-party accessories. But there\u2019s a bit more to it than that.\n\nFor starters, it\u2019s more expensive than the iPad it replaces, the \u00a3319 9.7-inch iPad from 2018. And secondly, if you want to get the most from it, you\u2019re going to want to equip it with Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil, which cost \u00a3159 and \u00a389 respectively. All told, if you want the 10.2-inch iPad with the cheapest configuration (32GB) and the two accessories, you\u2019re looking at \u00a3597.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s either that, or you could buy the iPad Air or iPad Mini for \u00a3479 or \u00a3399 respectively \u2013 both of them have faster processors and twice the amount of internal storage for those prices.\n\nBut despite that fact, for the majority of people, this iPad 10.2-inch iPad (with a Smart Keyboard and Pencil) is probably the best option.\n\nIt gives you the full access to iPadOS and a way to be productive on the move. If you\u2019re already an iPhone user then you\u2019ll find the interlinking between the two \u2013 things like AirDrop and iCloud \u2013 to be invaluable.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re wired in to a Spotify premium membership and have a Netflix account, the lack of space on this iPad (there is a 128GB version available for \u00a3449) won\u2019t be a problem. In fact, if you did buy this iPad, Apple will give you a year\u2019s subscription to Apple TV+ for free \u2013 which works out saving you \u00a360 over the course of the year.\n\nThis is your best introduction to iPadOS for both productivity and entertainment (Metro)\n\nBut what is the new iPad actually like to use? Well, the answer is that it\u2019s almost exactly the same as last year\u2019s version. The 10.2-inch iPad has the same processor, camera, battery and Lightning connector as the 9.7-inch iPad. It\u2019s still got a Home button and chunky bezels \u2013 if you want FaceID and more screen real estate, you have to go for the iPad Pro. Similarly, you\u2019re still going to have to pair and charge the Apple Pencil by removing the cap and jabbing it into the Lightning port.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s different is the slightly larger LCD screen (obviously) and the addition of the Smart Keyboard connector on one side. Also, this iPad is made from 100% recycled aluminium \u2013 further helping to boost Apple\u2019s green credentials.\n\nThat bigger screen means it\u2019s better for visual things like watching movies and playing games (check out Apple Arcade) but also for viewing full-fat websites and exciting things like spreadsheets.\n\nThe black band at the top of the iPad is the cellular antenna (Metro)\n\nPerformance is fast *enough* but bear in mind this device uses the same processor as the iPhone 7 from 2016. The difference between this and, say, last year\u2019s iPad Pro is obvious when you try something really intensive like editing 4K videos in iMovie.\n\nThen again, the kinds of people that are going to want to frequently edit 4K movies on an iPad will be exactly the people who go and buy the Pro. This \u00a3350 iPad is more for those of us that want a light (it weighs 483g) to accomplish basic tasks on the move. The Smart Keyboard may cost a bit much, but it clips on seamlessly and doesn\u2019t require charging \u2013 which is a blessing. This iPad is for people that want to get ahead of emails on the train in to the office and watch Netflix on the way home. Or the person that wants to work on a blog post on the sofa each night while the flatmates commandeer the TV.\n\nIt also speaks to Apple\u2019s approach to tablets \u2013 which is to make some kind of iPad available for every kind of person at every kind of price point.\n\nTo get the most from this iPad, you\u2019re going to want an Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard (Apple)\n\nAnd when you think about the tablet marketplace (with the possible exception of Microsoft\u2019s Surface range) at this point, it\u2019s quickly apparent that Apple\u2019s new 10.2-inch iPad is the best package for the most people. It\u2019s cheap(ish), works with all the Lightning cables you already own and is robustly made.\n\nThere\u2019s a big benefit because of iPadOS and, rumour has it, some people actually prefer having TouchID, a Home button and a headphone jack. Thank goodness there\u2019s a headphone jack.", "description": "A marginal iPad refresh has arrived", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iPad-2019-10.2-inch-db3f_1571062382.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
