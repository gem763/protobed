It also includes a couple of select quotes from interviews they did with Comey\u2019s advisers where Comey's advisers are telling the IG they were stunned, they were shocked, it was disappointment to see that this is how Comey had acted.\"\n\nPerhaps Comey should read the whole report before claiming to be the victim.\n\nDOJ IG \"found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.\" I don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u201csorry we lied about you\u201d would be nice. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 29, 2019\n\nAnd to all those who\u2019ve spent two years talking about me \u201cgoing to jail\u201d or being a \u201cliar and a leaker\u201d\u2014ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 29, 2019", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:15:23AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/159/8957f667-532f-4ffc-8c81-3fc3a24faeb6.jpg"}
