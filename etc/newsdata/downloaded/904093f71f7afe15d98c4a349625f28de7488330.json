USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53)\u2014an Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyer\u2014conducted the test shortly after midnight on Dec. 14 to demonstrate a Sea Based Terminal endo-atmospheric defensive capability.\n\n\"This test demonstrated the capabilities MDA and the Navy are delivering to our fleet commanders,\" Vice Adm. Jim Syring, director of the MDA said in a statement. \"The SM-6 missile and the Aegis Weapon System continue to prove that they are critical components of our nation's multilayered, robust ballistic missile defense system.\"\n\nDuring the test, John Paul Jones\u2014which is fitted with the latest Baseline 9.C1 version of the Aegis combat system\u2014engaged a \u201ccomplex medium-range ballistic missile target.\u201d That suggests that the target was representative of a maneuvering incoming warhead similar to the ones mounted on the Chinese DF-21D or DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles.\n\nIf MDA test was indeed representative of a DF-21D or DF-26 type threat, it would help to explain why the U.S. Navy is so confident of its ability to operate inside those weapons\u2019 threat rings. Earlier this year, I directly asked the U.S. Navy\u2019s Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. John Richardson, if he was confident in the ability of the aircraft carrier and its air wing to fight inside an A2/AD zone protected by anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles as well as advanced air defenses. Richardson\u2019s unequivocal answer was: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe MDA also revealed an interesting fact about the SM-6 missile. Unlike other ballistic missile interceptors, the SM-6 uses an explosive warhead to defeat ballistic missile threats. Other missile defense interceptors\u2014such as the Raytheon Standard SM-3\u2014use kinetic-energy hit-to-kill technology. The explosive warhead is likely required for the missile\u2019s multi-mission capability.\n\nThe SM-6 is rapidly becoming a multipurpose wonder-weapon of sorts. While the SM-6 was originally designed to provide the Navy\u2019s surface combatants\u2014such as the Ticonderoga-class missile cruisers and Arleigh Burke-class destroyers\u2014an expanded over-the-horizon air defense capability against enemy aircraft and cruise missiles as part at the Naval Integrated Fire Control \u2013 Counter Air construct, it has been adapted to other purposes.\n\nIn addition to countering air threat, it has been adapted for ballistic missile defense and as a long-range anti-ship weapon. Earlier this year, John Paul Jones sank the decommissioned Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate USS Reuben James (FFG 57) with a SM-6 missile. \u201cThis test event demonstrated Raytheon's decades of continued technological development and partnership with the U.S. Navy,\u201d said Dr. Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon\u2019s missile systems division, in a statement released on March 7. \u201cThe ability to leverage the Standard Missile Family and the legacy AWS [Aegis Weapon System] in newly fielded systems brings additional warfighting capability to the U.S. Fleet.\u201d\n\nFinding multiple uses for the SM-6 was the brainchild of the Pentagon\u2019s Strategic Capabilities Office. \u201cIt took an anti-air missile\u2014excellent missile\u2014of the Navy's and figured out how to make it also capable of attacking ships. Very sophisticated, long-range, fast, very lethal weapon. And we had bought it for one reason. They found a way to use it in another way as well, sort of doubling the value of our investment,\u201d Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters on Nov. 17. \u201cThat's the kind of thing we've gotten out of the SCO. Very creative group of people that work with and for all the services and help them figure out how to be even more innovative with the programs they have.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the U.S. Navy seems to have hit the jackpot with the SM-6\u2014which by all indications is an excellent weapon. If it proves to be effective against the Chinese DF-21D and DF-26, it may well help preserve America\u2019s access to Western Pacific.\n\nDave Majumdar is the defense editor for the National Interest.
