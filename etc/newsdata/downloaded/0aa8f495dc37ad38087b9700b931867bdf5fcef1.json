Kava capsules are up to pharmaceutical standards\n\nHarry at on a stage as he was given the whale's tooth, a sign of wealth, in the vakasobu, before he were given kava, a drink made from a mashed plant root in the yaqona vakaturaga\n\nInfluencer Amy Castano (pictured) holds up one of the recently cultivated kava plants in Fiji\n\nKava has a depressant effect on the central nervous system and can slow down the messages travelling between the brain and the body.

It has been tipped as a natural alternative medicine to treat anxiety, insomnia and stress.\n\nHowever, the earthy drink has been shrouded in controversy for decades.\n\nIt was banned in a number of countries in 2002, including Australia, the UK, Canada and European nations over concerns it can cause liver problems.\n\nDuring a visit to Suva in 1982 the Duke of Edinburgh also drank kava, just like that given to Prince Harry\n\nThe Queen was also pictured drinking the traditional Fijian drink on an official visit to Fiji in October 1982, more than a decade after it joined the Commonwealth\n\nDuring a visit to Suva in 1982 the Duke of Edinburgh also drank kava, just like that given to Prince Harry last year\n\nHowever, the World Health Organisation released a report declaring kava to be a safe product in 2007.\n\nThe Australian Health website states the forms of kava used traditionally by Pacific Islanders and by some aboriginal communities are not believed to be associated with the serious forms of liver damage.\n\nThe plant was introduced to Australia in the 1980s by Pacific islander missionaries as an alternative to alcohol.\n\nOn an isolated farm on one of Fiji's many island's is a business with the potential to boost Fiji's economy tenfold\n\nTo get to the island travellers can take a winding bus ride four hours east of Nadi, before hopping on a 45 minute ferry to Levuka\n\nIt had to be restricted in the Northern Territory and Western Australia in the 1990s as it was being abused by being mixed with alcohol.\n\nThese days people can possess up to two kilograms of the product but it is still illegal to import and sell in the Northern Territory, according to the Kava Management Act 1998.\n\nThe root has seen a resurgence across the globe. Now there are more than 100 kava bars in the United States, which is up from around 30 in 2012, according to The New York Times.\n\nKava export has potential to be huge in Fiji, with an estimated $30.7million worth of the product exported last year alone. The bulk was sent to New Zealand, Hawaii and the United States.\n\nLush greenery stretches as far as the eye can see. The clear blue water stands out against the dense bush\n\nAnd Zane Yoshida and his team from Fiji Kava, based in Brisbane, are hoping to capatalise on its potential by creating a reputable product.\n\nOn an isolated farm on one of Fiji's many islands is a business with the potential to boost the country's economy tenfold.\n\nTo get to the island travellers can take a winding bus ride four hours east of Nadi, before hopping on a 45 minute ferry to Levuka.\n\nThe island is a far cry from the resorts Fiji is known for.\n\nHidden in the hills is the farm where Mr Yoshida and his team have been planting the Kava with the aim of cultivating the product ready to be turned into capsules and teas\n\nThe company opened its first tissue culture laboratory in Levuka last month which is expected to standardise the quality of kava produced in Fiji\n\nLush greenery stretches as far as the eye can see. The clear blue water stands out against the dense bush.\n\nThere are no swimming pools here and you'd probably struggle to find a cocktail anywhere on the island.\n\nThe island is filled with dilapidated houses and only a handful of businesses - but a resurgence has been promised thanks to kava's potential as a major export product.\n\nHidden in the hills is the farm where Mr Yoshida and his team have been planting the Kava with the aim of cultivating the product ready to be turned into capsules and teas.\n\n'The tissue lab will grow disease free plantlets as well as create exact copies of plants that have desirable traits, improving the quality and yield of kava'\n\nKava has a depressant effect on the central nervous system and can slow down the messages travelling between the brain and the body\n\nAs not all kava plants are created equal, the company has opened its first tissue culture laboratory in Levuka last month, which is expected to standardise the quality of kava produced in Fiji.\n\nHow not all kava plants are the same: Kava varieties can be broken down into three basic types: \u2022 Noble kava \u2022 Tudei ('Two-days') kava \u2022 Wild kavas Noble Kava is high standard, cultivated kava that can be exported in root or supplement form. It is free from toxins and impurities. Tudei kava is a particularly potent strain. This strain is prohibited for international export, however, often makes its way onto the market. Tudei kava can damage the reputation of kava as it may cause nausea and other unpleasant side effects. It is so-called 'two-day' as the effects can last up to 48 hours. Wild kava is another inferior variety grown in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.\n\nThe plan is to create disease-free, good quality planting material.\n\n'This tissue culture facility is a further commitment from Fiji Kava Ltd to help ensure Fiji produce world-class disease-free kava and to meet burgeoning demand for kava from around the world.\n\n'This investment is pioneering and will help standardise the quality of kava globally in the future.'\n\nMr Yoshida said Kava there had been an uptick in kava popularity in western markets, and tissue culture technology would help guarantee quality.\n\n'Once ''clean'' kava plants are established in the nursery, the growth of axillary buds can be accelerated to produce material from which tissue cultures can be established,' Mr Yoshida said.\n\n'The tissue lab will grow disease free plantlets as well as create exact copies of plants that have desirable traits, improving the quality and yield of kava.\n\n'These plantlets are then provided to growers \u2013 more than 200 who are supported by Fiji Kava - helping them create a sustainable business model.\n\nZane Yoshida and his team from Fiji Kava , based in Brisbane, are hoping to capatalise on its potential by creating a reputable product\n\nThe island is filled with dilapidated houses and only a handful of businesses - but a resurgence has been promised thanks to kava's potential as a major export product\n\n'The lab is also an important part of the standardisation of desirable kavalactone profiles - the medicinal, anti-anxiety quality in kava \u2013 as Fiji Kava moves into clinical trials.'\n\nDoes kava cause liver problems? Researchers at the University of Queensland claimed the problematic products sold in Europe did not use kava extracts prepared in the traditional way of using the plant in the Pacific Islands. Researchers also believed those products had been created using the wrong parts of the plant.\n\nHe said they saw tissue culture as a long-term solution for creating a sustainable and growing kava industry.\n\nHe said that as legislation and regulations are developed and applied across the globe, the demand for the product looks set to increase.\n\n'The growth in demand internationally for kava-based products is already huge, and there is still a wealth of untapped potential. Kava farmers of Fiji are poised to benefit immensely.'\n\n'This is why a standardised product is extremely important. Producing a consistently high-quality kava-based product is essential, and for this reason, we have undertaken extensive local research.'\n\nCelebrity personal trainer Jono Castano (pictured) holding a kava plant at the Fiji Kava farm in Levuka\n\nThe Fijian Government is hoping it will be an alternative industry to sugar\n\nThe Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) established an expert committee in 2003 to review the safety of kava-containing medicines.\n\nSince then, Kava has been available as a supplement sold in health stores in other parts of Australia.\n\nHowever, there is a limit on the maximum amount of Piper methysticum permitted per dosage form.\n\nFor a tablet or a capsule, there is a limit of 125mg of kavalactones and for a tea bag, there is a limit of 3g of dried rhizome.\n\nIn addition, all products containing Piper methysticum must comply with a maximum daily dose of not more than 250mg of kavalactones.\n\nMr Yoshida and his team are hoping the product will become more prominent in Australian stores in the near future.\n\nReporter Kelsey Wilkie was invited to Fiji by Fiji Kava and Fiji Airways to cover this story.", "description": "Proponents of its use claim it can cure insomnia, aches and anxiety - and now Brisbane company Fiji Kava is hoping to bring its benefits to Australia.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/03/18897708-0-image-a-27_1569377055687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
