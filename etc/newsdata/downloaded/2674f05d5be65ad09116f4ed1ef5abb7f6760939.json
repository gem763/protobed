Standing in the stately Gaston Hall auditorium at Georgetown University\u2014which has hosted the likes of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Bono\u2014the Facebook CEO declared, \u201cI\u2019m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\u201d\n\nAnd a city full of regulation-hungry politicians and foes of Big Tech undoubtedly thought: How\u2019s that working out?\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s highly promoted speech introduced no new Facebook features or initiatives, but was a defiant reply to critics of Facebook\u2019s destructive effects on global society\u2014manipulating voters, fomenting division, and even aiding genocide. He doubled down on Facebook\u2019s handling of the treacherous business of implementing free expression at an unprecedented global scale. Despite considerable evidence that the approach has often fallen short, Zuckerberg still professes optimism: Giving people a voice and connecting the world, he believes, are transformationally positive actions. Essentially, he\u2019s saying\u2014as he always has\u2014that Facebook is essentially positive.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he was claiming high ground for Facebook\u2019s values. If you disagree with him on speech, he implied, you\u2019re siding with the forces of censorship and elitism. He described a \u201ccountertrend \u2026 to pull back on free expression.\u201d His foes, he implied, are the same kind of people who wanted Eugene Debs in prison, who wanted Vietnam protesters stopped. But the people whose Facebook presence is more disturbing include the likes of Alex Jones (whom Facebook ultimately banned) or \u2026 Donald Trump. The speech didn\u2019t really take on those kinds of choices.\n\nFurthermore, rejecting his point of view will align you with the oppressive overlords of China! He pointedly noted that his dreams of taking Facebook to that country have been stalemated by that country\u2019s demands on data and censorship. While Facebook\u2019s encrypted WhatsApp service is a boon to protesters, he says, the Chinese TikTok app censors mentions of protests even for users in the US.\n\nZuckerberg clearly believed in what he was saying: Though his presentation was sometimes halting (maybe reflecting that he was tinkering with the speech until his deadline), his voice grew stronger when invoking Facebook as an instrument of empowerment. He spoke for almost 40 minutes, which is what happens when senators aren\u2019t interrupting you.\n\nBut while he constantly described Facebook as giving voice to everyday people and underrepresented groups, he gave short shrift to the way that powerful forces are using his platform to manipulate people. In the past two years, Zuckerberg and his leadership team have admitted that they were late to recognize the downside of free expression: political extremism, intentional misinformation, and political ads that baldly lie.\n\nAt every turn, the company has avoided becoming an arbiter of what is news and what political utterances are destructive. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\u201d he said, a sentiment he often expresses. But neither does that mean that a private company has to promote outright lies and divisive content. It would have been interesting if he\u2019d grappled with that concept more in his Georgetown address.\n\nMaybe the most powerful part of the speech was when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be around forever,\u201d and so he thinks it essential to deeply embed free speech values into Facebook so the company continues giving voice to people long after he\u2019s gone.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s foray into the belly of the Beltway to deliver a message of free speech was, in a sense, a daring gambit. It\u2019s hard to disagree with the First Amendment, and even less attractive to align with censors. But his critics\u2014and a lot of people who are simply unhappy with Facebook\u2014are asking for more. Boosting speech at global scale is a tricky and unprecedented practice. Though Zuckerberg constantly cites the army he now employs in matters of security and safety (up to 35,000), it\u2019s not clear that a \u201ccommunity\u201d of almost 3 billion people can be purged of truly destructive content. Facebook is a huge experiment that constantly tests Zuckerberg\u2019s deeply felt claim that connecting the world will yield a net positive. The results are far from settled.\n\nAfter the speech, Zuckerberg took a few questions from Georgetown students in the audience (which were submitted in writing, not offered spontaneously). One questioned whether Facebook was favoring conservatives with its green light to misinformation in political ads. Zuckerberg agreed with Georgetown\u2019s moderator that liberals are angry, too. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re doing a very good job of making everyone angry at us,\u201d he said.\n\nNo one seemed to disagree with that. And things won\u2019t change after Zuckerberg\u2019s Tom Paine moment.\n\nThis story originally appeared on wired.com.", "description": "Zuckerberg reaffirmed his view that Facebook makes the world a better place.", "authors": ["Steven Levy"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zuck-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
