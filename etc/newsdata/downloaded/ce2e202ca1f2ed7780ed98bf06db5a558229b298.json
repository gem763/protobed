Adam Schiff, quasi leader of the skunk pack of Democrats, suddenly decided the whistleblower he dangled before the media, promising testimony that would blow the lid off impeachment and send President Donald Trump packing, has suddenly decided he don\u2019t need no stinkin\u2019 testimony.\n\nThe common denominator with these stunning reversals?\n\nBoth testimonies would\u2019ve put Democrats in the position of having to stand and suffer some of their own fire.\n\nThey would\u2019ve had to produce the goods, or pipe down and go away. And in the world of political poker, such as they\u2019ve been playing, their only tool is the bluff.\n\nLook at these rapidly changing times \u2014 first, Schiff on Twitter on September 27: \u201cI want to thank the whistleblower for coming forward, and for their courage. I urge others to do so as well \u2014 notwithstanding the threats and intimidation. Our democracy depends on it.\u201d\n\nThe media ran with it, covering Trump\u2019s telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine as if the White House had sold the farm in exchange for dirt on Hunter-slash-Joe-Biden. The catch was the transcript of the call, released by the White House, didn\u2019t show that sell-out. But why bother with facts when the whistleblower, in all his or her second-hand hearsay glory, offers such opportunities for innuendo? Even when it\u2019s later revealed the whistleblower is not really a whistleblower, because he or she broke the rules of whistleblowing by chatting it up with Team Schiffers before speaking with the inspector general?\n\nNo worries.\n\nFrom ABC, Oct. 6: \u201c2nd whistleblower comes forward after speaking with IG: Attorney.\u201d\n\nHow convenient.\n\nBut still, my how this whole whistleblower narrative crumbles.\n\n\u201cSchiff admits he should have been \u2018much more clear\u2019 about contact with whistleblower,\u201d Fox News reported a couple of days ago.\n\nRight. Because otherwise, the process has all the appearances of a political hatchet job, rather than an unbiased, for-the-American-people investigation. But even in his admission of smoke and mirrors, Schiff can\u2019t keep from convoluting: The word is \u201cclearer.\u201d No need to do the wordy dance of \u201cmuch more clear.\u201d That\u2019s what the guilty do when they\u2019re caught in their guilt: stutter-step over clarity.\n\nThen came this drum of fear \u2014 as if Republicans were looming, lurking, threatening in the background: \u201cProtecting whistleblower\u2019s identity is \u2018our primary interest,\u2019 Schiff says,\u201d The Washington Post reported, also a couple of days ago.\n\nAnd then finally, triumphantly, from The Hill, this: \u201cSchiff: Whistleblower testimony might not be necessary.\u201d\n\nAfter all that \u2014 no testimony needed?\n\nHere\u2019s why: Schiff\u2019s whistleblower would have had to endure Republican scrutiny \u2014 and even more importantly, Schiff himself would have had to endure Republican scrutiny. Both testimonies would have fallen in the face of questioning.\n\nMoving on. Next up, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nFollowing a two-week recess, spent in large part listening to Democratic Party operatives make their endless media pitches for impeachment, Pelosi opened in Washington, D.C., with this quick update on the impeachment inquiry: \u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\nIn other words: Democrats don\u2019t have the numbers to open an official hearing on impeachment, so rather than go on record \u2014 rather than take a transparent, public vote \u2014 they\u2019re going to keep up the charade of an \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d Because what is an \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d after all, but a political strategy to go on impeachment hunt after impeachment hunt, without having to show impeachment proof.\n\nDemocrats talk but don\u2019t deliver. Democrats threaten \u2014 but they have nothing to follow through their threats.\n\nDemocrats huff and puff and bluff and blow \u2014 but in the end, when accountability looms, it\u2019s not the White House walls that fall. It\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
