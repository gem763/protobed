Facebook\u2019s Fashion++ system recommends small changes to an outfit to make it more fashionable?\n\nThe tech giants Amazon, Google and Facebook have all begun to use machine learning to give you tips on what to wear. Is fashion styling the next field to be disrupted by artificial intelligence (AI), or will the human eye remain supreme?\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to know for sure, but understanding what machine learning is good at and how that overlaps with what fashion is all about can help us make some educated guesses.\n\nGet that look\n\nOne thing machine learning does very well is find patterns and common features among groups of items.\n\nREAD MORE: Why is everyone suddenly wearing this same outfit?\n\nTaking advantage of this, Google Lens and Amazon Style Snap can each identify a garment from a photo or video and then tell you a bit more, like how other people have worn it or where you can buy it.\n\nThis serves the same function as a fashion magazine taking a celebrity look and breaking it down into pieces. By allowing consumers to recreate looks from movies, music videos, magazines and the runway, it democratises elements of styling.\n\nAmazon also goes further, linking garments to a database of looks from popular fashion influencers. This offers the customer creative inspirations to build looks (and conveniently gives the influencers a cut if the customers buys the clothes).\n\nThis system has great potential, but it can only be as good as the data that\u2019s fed into it. A large and diverse database could bring out cultures and beauty standards that are not often seen in magazines or television, allowing people to find their tribe. But a narrower collection of sources will only produce more of the same.\n\nThe stylist in the machine\n\n\n\nThe next step in computer fashion \u2013 using AI to offer styling judgements \u2013 has so far been less successful.\n\nREAD MORE: Meet Noonoouri - the virtual Instagram influencer who has her eye on some of our favourite local designers\n\nAmazon\u2019s Echo Look is a voice-controlled camera that aims to function as a style assistant, comparing two photos using a machine learning algorithm and telling you which one scores better. So far it has received lacklustre reviews.\n\nThis service seems doomed to struggle, as it neglects many basic principles of fashion design.\n\nFor example, many looks from influencers only have a front view. How can you possibly style an outfit properly without the whole picture? Most principles of styling also take into account the wearer\u2019s body shape, how well fitted their clothing is, their personality, and the occasion for which the garment is being worn. Context, symbolism, nostalgia, and personal preferences also play a role.\n\nREAD MORE: Instagram and Facebook boutiques - How social media has changed the way we shop\n\nThe AI assistant has no way to address these nuances. To succeed, the machine learning engineers will need to understand fashion better and find useful and tangible tasks for AI to perform.\n\nAlgorithmic zhooshing\n\nFacebook\u2019s experimental Fashion++ project goes further still, trying to tell you how to improve the outfit you\u2019re wearing.\n\nThe idea behind the software is to make small changes (known as minimal edits) to an outfit, such as tucking in a shirt, rolling up a sleeve, changing the length of a hem, or removing an accessory. Garments are defined as \u201cfashionable\u201d if they are popular on a database and the AI learns to edit looks to make them score more highly in this regard.\n\nThis relies on a massive oversimplification of how the craft of fashion design works. Simply mimicking elements of what is popular and putting them together is no guarantee for an aesthetically pleasing look.\n\nThere is no guarantee that the most popular look \u2013 the statistical \u201cmode\u201d \u2013 will be truly fashionable, or \u201c\u00e0 la mode\u201d.\n\nA spy in your wardrobe\n\nAs we start taking photos and streaming videos of what we desire, or begin uploading photos of ourselves in our underwear, we should keep in mind that our data is being stored and mined. For data-mining corporations, we and our personal information that can be used to influence our behaviour and sold on to advertisers.\n\nREAD MORE: This Youtuber faked that she went to the Coachella festival and fooled everyone\n\nEven if you are unconcerned with your personal data being shared, AI products are likely to encourage needless consumption over the actual goal of making you look attractive. Often when people seek the help of a stylist or a second opinion on their appearance, it is not even about the clothing.\n\nSome need validation or attention, or are set in their ways what makes them look attractive. Fashion styling serves a whole range of functions: creating a look of beauty, projecting power, attracting a romantic partner, or making the wearer feel special. There is no guarantee that even a stylist and some new clothing can achieve these goals \u2013 an app barely stands a chance.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
