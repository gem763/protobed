Selling or borrowing against his own shares in the company to buy five mansions and a private jet?\n\nIf you\u2019re SoftBank, you throw billions more at WeWork, presumably hoping that a sudden torrent of cash will extinguish this monetary bonfire. Also, you pay the entrepreneur, Adam Neumann, more than $1 billion to stop tossing matches at your money and go away.\n\nAD\n\nThis might be the most spectacular implosion of a business in U.S. history. Other failures were bigger, in mere dollars. But WeWork has to be the most literally incredible. Profanity seems somehow inadequate. It\u2019s just . . . holy wow.\n\nAD\n\nIn the end, SoftBank reportedly will have invested $18.5 billion in this disaster, more than the gross domestic product of Jamaica. Think about that: Instead of buying a co-working company with an astronomical burn rate, Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, and the sovereign wealth funds that invested with him could have had all the stuff produced in Jamaica for an entire year \u2014 aluminum ore, coffee, rum. They could have rented out every hotel room, restaurant and movie theater on the island just for themselves and their friends, and they could have frolicked up and down Dunn\u2019s River Falls like Tom Cruise and Elisabeth Shue in \u201cCocktail.\u201d\n\nInstead, Son gave that money to Neumann to rent empty offices, buy a lot of plate glass and create what a WeWork tenant of my acquaintance called \u201ca high-tech prison\u201d with \u201cconcentric rectangles of fully transparent cells.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCo-working spaces can be profitable, mind you. But normal co-working landlords don\u2019t get valued at the extravagant revenue multiples Neumann asked for \u2014 and got \u2014 by redubbing his facilities a \u201cphysical social network.\u201d The overevaluation was obvious to my friend, sitting in his glass cube and watching WeWork\u2019s tenants turn over like a turbine. It was obvious to me, sitting at my desk at The Post. If you\u2019d asked either of us what to do with that $18.5 billion, we\u2019d have gone to Jamaica. It\u2019s hard to understand why Son instead chose a multi-year mystery tour led by Neumann.\n\nAD\n\nThe WeWork story is so utterly bizarre that people can\u2019t even get properly outraged about it. I mean, they\u2019re trying \u2014 Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) tweeted Wednesday night that \u201cNeumann is a fraud & a good example of why some people support a socialist like @BernieSanders. He ought to be sued & investigated.\u201d\n\nAnd sure, you\u2019d think there must be an indictment in the offing somewhere. Neumann\u2019s self-dealing was so egregious that kleptocrats around the world are enviously scribbling notes.\n\nAD\n\nBut that\u2019s the magnificent insanity of all this: Neumann\u2019s predation was apparently legal. And it\u2019s not even clear it shouldn\u2019t be. After all, everyone who gave Neumann money was a rich, experienced investor who knowingly and voluntarily ceded managerial control to a spaced-out co-working guru. I\u2019m not saying Neumann\u2019s behavior was admirable, except in a roguish anti-hero kind of way. But is it the government\u2019s job to stop venture capitalists from climbing into a start-up\u2019s metaphorical back seat, handing over the keys and letting chief executives take them for a ride? After all, professional venture capitalists are generally going to be better able to assess the viability of a business model than judges or, for that matter, senators.\n\nAD\n\nIt does seem outrageous that Neumann got so much while WeWork\u2019s employees will get to keep their jobs only if they\u2019re lucky. But it\u2019s not like Neumann took that more than $1 billion payout from them. SoftBank gave him voting control over the company, which allowed him to essentially take WeWork hostage and demand a ransom. With a saner governance structure, Neumann couldn\u2019t have done this, and SoftBank could have kept the $1 billion; either way, no court was going to make them gift it to the suffering staff.\n\nSo maybe the indictment needed here should be aimed at capitalism, which enabled such an absurd and outrageous outcome. But the premise of capitalism was never that individual capitalists always make wise choices, only that when those capitalists do something egregiously stupid, markets will eventually make them stop. That\u2019s exactly what happened as soon as WeWork filed for an IPO.\n\nAD\n\nWhich might be the craziest thing of all about this story: The regulated public markets worked exactly as intended, protecting ordinary retail investors from the folly of the people who were supposed to know better. I wouldn\u2019t exactly call that a happy ending, but we probably can\u2019t expect a better one.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Adam Neumann held a whole company hostage, legally.", "authors": ["Megan Mcardle"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/49rtbltkVDhAUBkPmXkX-hnqjSI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SRDBJNXXKQI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
