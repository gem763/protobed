The lid of the console was closed,\" a woman explained on Facebook. \"It was hot yesterday and the can exploded. It blew the console cover off of its hinges, shot through the sunroof, and went high enough in the air that it landed about 50 feet away.\"\n\nChristine Bader Debrecht/Facebook\n\nChristine Bader Debrecht shared pictures of the aftermath to \"hopefully prevent others from experiencing this damage or even injury.\"\n\nDebrecht's post has been shared over 5,000 times and garnered over 2,000 likes.\n\nOne photo showed the green 7-ounce can with the bottom completely removed from the rest of the cylinder. The label also had a \"DANGER\" warning that reads \"extremely flammable, container may explode if heated.\"\n\nChristine Bader Debrecht/Facebook\n\n\"I just want to remind you (and your kids) to heed those warnings on products you may be using. Please don't leave aerosol cans (and especially dry shampoo, as this seems to be an issue with some brands) in your car,\" she wrote. \"I am so grateful that no one was hurt.\"\n\nDebrecht told ABC News her husband was the one to first discover the damage to the 2018 Honda Civic hatchback, \"when he went to let the dogs out after he got home from work.\"\n\n\"We were shocked and bewildered. We had no idea what had happened,\" she explained. \"It took us quite some time to solve the mystery, but my daughter finally put it all together.\"\n\nShe continued, \"We couldn't believe it had done so much damage. We still can't believe it.\"", "description": "A woman shared images on Facebook of her sunroof that shattered after she said a bottle of dry shampoo exploded on a hot day.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/exploding-can-ht-jt-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
