USA TODAY\n\nCardinals insider Bob McManaman offers a breakdown of Sunday\u2019s game between the Cardinals and Falcons at State Farm Stadium:\n\nRecap: Rookie quarterback Kyler Murray passed for 340 yards and led the offense to scoring drives on each of its first five possessions, but the Cardinals had to hold on, score late and get a little luck in defeating the Falcons 34-33 on Sunday at State Farm Stadium.\n\nThe win was the second straight for the Cardinals (2-3-1), who improved to 10-2 at home against Atlanta. It was the third straight loss for the Falcons (1-5) as the seat gets hotter on head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nAtlanta trailed 27-10 four minutes into the third quarter but scored on four of its last five possessions and after Matt Ryan\u2019s 12-yard touchdown pass to Devonta Freeman, was all ready to tie the score at 34 with Matt Bryant\u2019s all-important extra point attempt with 1:53 left to play.\n\nBryant, though, missed the kick wide left and the Cardinals took over possession, got a game-saving first down on a 5-yard scramble from Murray, and ran out the clock.\n\nIn a 53-32 loss last week to the Texans, the Falcons surrendered 592 total yards. The Cardinals gained 300 by halftime in taking a 20-10 lead and they finished with 444 yards overall.\n\nMurray completed 27 of 37 passes for three touchdowns, a 2-yard screen to Chase Edmonds in the second quarter, a 20-yard toss on a misdirection play to tight end Maxx Williams in the third and a 14-yarder to David Johnson in the fourth with 5:12 left to play. Murray, who did not throw an interception and was not sacked, had six completions that went for at least 20 yards, including a high of 58 yards on a deep ball over the middle to Damiere Byrd, which set up Arizona\u2019s first touchdown.\n\nJohnson, who was questionable to play because of back stiffness, scored on a 1-yard touchdown run and finished with 34 yards on 12 carries to go along with six receptions for 68 receiving yards.\n\nRyan was 30-of-36 for 356 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions. Tight end Auston Hooper caught eight passes for 117 yards and a touchdown and Julio Jones added eight receptions for 108 yards.\n\nTurning point: It was anyone\u2019s game until the unthinkable \u2013 the extra-point attempt miss by the veteran Bryant. He knew it right away, yanking off his helmet in disgust while the Cardinals and the crowd celebrated wildly. Bryant later took a knee on the sideline, his hand over his face with his head facing down to the ground.\n\nStar player: There were several candidates here on both sides, but you have to give the nod to Murray. Despite the inexperience, he was cool and calm under pressure and didn\u2019t flinch when the Cardinals needed him most. His 5-yard run after the missed PAT to pick up the first down was huge.\n\nKey injuries: No new injuries reported. Johnson briefly left the game in the third quarter, but was able to return.\n\nUp next: The Cardinals play at the New York Giants next Sunday. Kickoff is 10 a.m. at MetLife Stadium. It\u2019s the first of back-to-back road game for Arizona, which also plays at the Saints on Oct. 27. Four of the Cardinals\u2019 next five games overall are on the road, as they play at the Buccaneers and 49ers on Nov. 10 and 17, respectively.", "description": "Matt Bryant missed an extra point for the Falcons that would have tied the game, and the Cardinals escaped with a victory.", "authors": ["Bob Mcmanaman", "Published P.M.
