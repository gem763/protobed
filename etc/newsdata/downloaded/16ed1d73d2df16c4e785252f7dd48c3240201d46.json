The harsh tone of the court\u2019s decision, and the unanimous vote of 11 Supreme Court judges, led many to say Johnson can\u2019t carry on. \u201cHis position is untenable and he should have the guts for once to do the decent thing and resign,\u201d Scottish National Party legislator Joanna Cherry said outside the court.
