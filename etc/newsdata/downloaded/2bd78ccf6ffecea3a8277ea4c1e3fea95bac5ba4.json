At the time, Matt Tompkins, a Democratic fundraiser, told The Hill: \u201cYou won\u2019t win in 2020 by unilaterally disarming.\u201d\n\nBut Biden senior adviser Kate Bedingfield shut down For the People PAC\u2019s buzz, when she replied to a tweet about the group with a brief statement: \u201c. @JoeBiden does not welcome support from super PACs.\u201d For the People PAC went quiet shortly afterward and never reported raising or spending money.\n\nThe filing for Unite the Country, which was first reported by Bloomberg News, marks the official beginning of an outside effort to boost the former vice president, a move that could raise and spend unlimited sums of money and give the cash-strapped Biden campaign a boost.\n\nThe group of operatives have hustled to form the PAC since Biden shifted his stance on super PACs and opened the door to their help last week. In past months, donors have been probed by Biden allies to see whether or not they\u2019d be open to giving more money beyond their initial campaign checks. Several have told POLITICO they would.\n\nRasky isn\u2019t a registered lobbyist, although others at his firm lobby for a handful of federal clients, including Raytheon, the Massachusetts-based defense contractor. Rasky owns an 87.2 percent stake in the firm, according to a Justice Department disclosure filing.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS COUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

But he stopped working for Azerbaijan in August, he wrote in an email to POLITICO, supplying a copy of a letter his lawyer sent to the Justice Department on Aug. 27. The firm no longer represents foreign clients, he said.\n\nRasky\u2019s firm also represented a Bangladeshi political party last year, reaching out to reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, POLITICO and other outlets on the party\u2019s behalf, according to a disclosure filing. The firm worked for the party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, as a subcontractor to Blue Star Strategies, a Washington lobbying shop run by two veterans of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\nBlue Star has another connection to the Bidens: The firm advised the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while Hunter Biden served on its board, according to The Times .\n\nKaren Tramontano, Blue Star\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview that she didn\u2019t know Rasky. She hired his firm because Anne Tyrrell, a senior vice president in Rasky Partners\u2019 Washington office, had come recommended to her. Tyrrell has since left Rasky Partners. Tramontano declined to comment on her firm\u2019s work for Burisma.\n\nRasky never registered to work for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and his firm stopped working for the party in January, according to a disclosure filing.\n\n\u201cI know nothing about Blue Star,\u201d Rasky wrote in an email to POLITICO. \u201cI never worked on the account.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/0d/af/521df80f4046b570f51b7832044d/20191009-biden-impeach-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
