More recently, scholars have pushed back against that idea, revealing the translators to have been animated far more by scholarly and theological considerations. Ward\u2019s draft, however, helps illustrate that it may be possible to correct too far in that direction. Various decisions Ward made as a translator seem to have been arrived at for what appear to be stylistic reasons, at least in part and in certain moments above all.\u201d\n\nAnd then this: \u201cThe connections of early feminism with secular ideologies such as liberalism and socialism are well known.\u201d But Satanism? \u201cDr. Per Faxneld obtained a PhD in History of Religions at Stockholm University in 2014. He is a professor at Stockholm University, was a visiting professor at Cambridge University in 2014 . . . Satanic Feminism is based on Faxneld\u2019s doctoral dissertation, which was awarded the Donner Institute Prize for Eminent Research on Religion. It discusses how prominent feminists\u2014primarily between 1880 and 1930\u2014used Satan as a symbol of their rejection of the so-called \u2018patriarchal traits of Christianity\u2019. It shows that these women were inspired by the period\u2019s most influential new religion, Theosophy, and how the anti-Christian discourses of radical secularism affected feminism. Satanic Feminism sheds a new light on the early feminist movement. It discusses neglected or unknown aspects of the intellectual connections of early feminism with Satanism in a way that nobody before Faxneld has dared to do.\u201d\n\nIn other news: Netflix has published a list of its most-watched movies and TV shows. Benjamin Lee writes about what it means: \u201cThe list of most-watched films, from Bird Box down to Fyre (20 million viewers), sees a gap of 60 million viewers, meaning that while some films hit big, a great many lag far, far behind. This doesn\u2019t make them flops per se, but it does mean that genuine phenomenons are hard to find. The list also shows that although Netflix has put a great deal of funding into both its awards push and its splashy partnerships with respected auteurs, audiences are less invested in the outcome than the company is. The most conspicuous absence is Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma, the platform\u2019s most critically acclaimed and awarded film to date.\u201d\n\nApril White writes about Andrew Carroll\u2019s effort to save millions of American letters written during wartime: \u201cAndrew Carroll is never far away from the slim black portfolio he calls \u2018the football.\u2019 Inside are more than two dozen original letters, creased and faded, bullet-torn and tear-stained, spanning 225 years of American war history, from the early days of the Revolution to 9/11. Each page is sheathed in a protective plastic sleeve, and for added security, there are the handcuffs. Carroll locks the case to his wrist when he travels, which he does almost constantly. By his own count, he was on the road almost 200 days last year, using this remarkable sampling of letters to convince anyone who will listen how important\u2014and ephemeral\u2014such documents are. It\u2019s all part of the historian\u2019s ambitious effort to rescue these eyewitness accounts from attics, basements, garage sales and trash bins.\u201d\n\nRecovering the real Lord Liverpool: \u201cLord Liverpool was an \u2018Arch Mediocrity who presided rather than ruled over this Cabinet of Mediocrities,\u2019 Benjamin Disraeli jibed in 1844. Still a young novelist and a frustrated Tory backbencher, Disraeli thus disparaged Robert Banks Jenkinson, second earl of Liverpool (1770\u20131828), who led Tory ministries from 1812 until his sudden death in 1828. Only Robert Walpole and William Pitt the Younger served longer than Liverpool as prime minister, and no one since has matched his longevity in office. Yet Disraeli\u2019s caustic judgment, as William Anthony Hay shows in this impressive book, not only went \u2018substantially unchallenged\u2019 in his own day but quickly cemented itself into conventional wisdom.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nIn Standpoint, John Laurenson writes about France\u2019s \u201cCatholic Disneyland\u201d\u2014Puy du Fou:\n\n\u201cThe year is 2019 AD. Gaul is entirely occupied by liberals, Europhiles, historical repenters, anti-Christians and \u201ccitizens of the World\u201d. Well, not entirely . . . One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders.\n\n\u201cThe Puy du Fou in the Vend\u00e9e region of western France is, according to Tripadvisor, the world\u2019s best theme park. It is certainly popular. It had 2.3 million visitors last year. It has won numerous prizes for its huge shows, featuring hundreds of costumed actors who recount the history of France through the prism of local history.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Sign of Triumph\u2019, for example, plays every couple of hours to 6,000 people in a stone-built replica of a Gallo-Roman colosseum. The sign in question is the fish, the emblem of early Christianity, defiantly traced in the sand by a Gaul named Damien, a Roman centurion who has converted to Christianity.\n\n\u201cThe Roman governor addresses the crowd (which is encouraged to boo him) as \u2018citizens of the Roman Empire, citizens of the World\u2019, and tells them that \u2018Gaul exists no more\u2019. Damien\u2019s having none of it. But if he doesn\u2019t win the chariot race he will be put to death.\n\n\u201cA race ensues with four chariots, each pulled by four horses; Damien wins but the governor goes back on his word. Now the upstart must fight for his life while the beautiful Gallic Christian maiden he loves is tied to a post with (real) lions released into the arena to eat her. The spectacle ends with a Gallic, Christian overthrow of the governor and a general, enthusiastic embracing of the faith.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n\u2018It\u2019s true, it\u2019s patriotic,\u2019 says Rozenn de Boisfoss\u00e9, paying her second visit to the park, along with her husband and four children. \u2018We\u2019re crying out to love our country nowadays. France has had its ups and downs\u2014no one is perfect!\u2014but here at least they show the beautiful side of our country.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd not only that: Philippe de Villiers, a high-profile Catholic politician, created the Puy du Fou in 1989, 200 years after the French Revolution, in part as revenge.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Remoray-Boujeons\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
