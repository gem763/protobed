People only engage if there is strong reason to.'\n\nHow are companies selected?\n\nAs it is an index fund, the GIRL fund does not have a named manager picking stocks but is run by the index fund management team, which is led by David Barron, head of index equity and smart beta.\n\nIt invests in the shares of around 350 of the UK's largest companies and aims to provide income and growth by tracking the Solactive L&G Gender in Leadership UK Index which is \u2018tilted\u2019 so that it favours companies that have achieved higher levels of gender diversity.\n\nThe Solactive L&G Gender in Leadership UK Index was created by ranking every company in the original Solactive GBS United Kingdom All Cap Index by how they score on the following criteria: the percentage of women on the board of directors, the percentage of women who are executives, the percentage of women who are managers and the percentage of women who are in the workforce.\n\nThe companies then receive a gender diversity score from 0 to 100 where 0 to 50 is considered a negative score and 50 to 100 is considered a positive score.\n\nTo achieve a high gender diversity score, companies need to reach at least 30 per cent representation of women in the four measures outlined.\n\nThe proprietary gender diversity scores are then applied to the original Solactive GBS United Kingdom All Cap Index, \u2018tilting\u2019 it in favour of high scoring companies which are put together to create the Solactive L&G Gender in Leadership UK Index.\n\nImproving diversity and gender equality\n\nSince its launch in May 2018, the L&G Future World GIRL fund has outperformed both the IA UK All Companies sector average and the FTSE 350, which is a proxy for the Solactive index\n\nIs it working?\n\nUp by 2.6 per cent more than a year since its launch in May last year, the fund has outperformed both the index as well as the Investment Association's UK All Companies sector average return.\n\nIt has also outperformed the FTSE 350, which is used as a proxy for the underlying Solactive Index, and is down 0.2 per cent over the same period.\n\nBut in addition to providing good returns, the fund aims to make a difference by encouraging the country's largest companies to assess and improve gender diversity within their senior teams.\n\nSome holdings have already improved their scores across the different female representation levels, since the fund was launched.\n\nFor example, the team said major pharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca saw an increase of 18 per cent in its diversity score to 77, with consistent increases in female representation at all levels.\n\nUK fashion house Burberry also increased its score by 14.5 per cent to 83.5 while Sage Group has seen a positive overall change in its gender diversity scores by 23 per cent to 57.\n\nWith L&G having engaged with Sage Group on diversity since 2016, the company now has 33 per cent women on the board and has significantly increased the representation of women in its executive and senior manager ranks.\n\nMorrisey added: 'I was contacted by several companies after we launched saying our scores were not accurate so in a way it has encouraged them to focus more attention on their data and present it more clearly.\n\n'A lot of companies have since improved their scores significantly. It will be great to see this ongoing and across all sectors.'\n\nCompanies launching their own initiatives\n\nMeanwhile, some names have gone on to produce their own research into gender diversity and how to drive better performance from a more diverse workforce.\n\nFor example, Vodafone UK released a report which showed mentorship schemes and role models are key to having a more diverse leadership group while leaders who work alongside their employees and have a positive approach to flexible working also drive gender diversity in senior positions.\n\nThe company itself has 36 per cent of its senior leadership roles filled by women with the target to reach 40 per cent by 2030.\n\nAccording to the report, which was conducted alongside YouGov, of those companies with higher rates of women in leadership roles, 28 per cent say they learn from those on the board while 26 per cent say that executive teams learn from the wider staff base.\n\nComparatively, at businesses with lower gender diversity, only 16 per cent think those working at a senior level learn from others.\n\nHelen Lamprell, general counsel and external affairs director at Vodafone UK, said: 'We really encourage employees to interact directly with the board. That means you can get some quite interesting questions coming through, but that's really important, because listening and learning from your employees is what enables us to stay close to our customers and to grow and to work well together.'\n\nYou can combine impact and returns\n\nL&G's Janine Menasakanian said she believes we are at the 'cutting edge of a new market'\n\nCommenting further on the GIRL fund, Janine Menasakanian, head of distribution strategy at L&G, added: 'The fund has generated significant debate around gender lens investing and we have seen growing interest from investors of all types since launch, including a recent institutional mandate.\n\n'However, we are in the early stages and we expect to see further mandates and investor commitment over the course of the next few years and especially when the fund has a longer track record of performance.\n\n'We believe we are at the cutting edge of a new market in gender lens investing and this fund is a way for is a powerful way investors to combine both impact and returns.'\n\nMorrisey added: 'I would like to see it carry on the same path it is on now. It's a long-term proposition so we we won't even say \"in three years from now\".\n\n'It\u2019s also not a special interest issue or just an excuse to be nice to women. It's about creating better businesses.'", "description": "This tracker fund has taken the gender equality concept to heart, backing UK firms that have a greater balance and beating the market since it launched in May 2018.", "authors": ["Jayna Rana For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
