Mandatory Credit: Mark Zerof-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTrask, who entered the game after third-year starter Feleipe Franks dislocated his ankle and was carted off, completed 9 of 13 passes for 126 yards. He also rushed 4 yards for the go-ahead touchdown with 4:11 remaining.\n\nRunning back Lamical Perine cut Florida\u2019s deficit to 21-16 with 12:41 remaining in the game when he scored on an 8-yard run, capping a six-play, 62-yard drive that required just 2:15.\n\nTrask put the Gators (3-0) up for good eight minutes later. The two-point conversion failed, and Florida led 22-21.\n\nKentucky (2-1), which dominated the first three quarters, had a chance to retake the lead late when the Wildcats marched 58 yards to set up a 35-yard field-goal attempt with 33 seconds remaining. But Chance Poore\u2019s kick sailed wide right.\n\nWith the Gators trying to run out the clock, Josh Hammond broke free for a 76-yard touchdown run to account for the final score.\n\nFlorida amassed 438 total yards, 300 in the air. The two quarterbacks combined for 21-of-30 passing with one touchdown.\n\nFranks was hurt while trying to scramble on fourth-and-1 late in the third quarter, getting caught from behind and having his right leg pinned as he was also tackled from the front. Head coach Dan Mullen told ESPN afterward the quarterback\u2019s season is likely over.\n\nVan Jefferson topped the Gators\u2019 receivers with seven catches for 93 yards. Hammond was Florida\u2019s top rusher with his one 76-yard run.\n\nKentucky had 407 yards, 267 via the pass.\n\nKentucky was playing its first full game since a season-ending knee injury to quarterback Terry Wilson. The junior had led the Wildcats to victories in 12 of his last 15 starts, including last year\u2019s upset at Florida and the Citrus Bowl victory over Penn State.\n\nHis replacement, Sawyer Smith, arrived at Kentucky in late June as a graduate transfer from Troy. Smith completed his first nine passes, including a 26-yard touchdown pass to Ahmad Wagner.\n\nSmith also rushed 1 yard for a score to give Kentucky a 14-7 halftime lead. He ended the game 23 of 35 for 267 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nKavosiey Smoke topped Kentucky with 81 yards rushing on 16 attempts. Lynn Bowden and Wagner each had 70 yards in receptions.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "No. 9 Florida, with backup quarterback Kyle Trask under center, scored three fourth-quarter touchdowns to rally for a 29-21 victory over Kentucky on Saturday night in their SEC matchup in Lexington, Ky.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430008298&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E02X-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
