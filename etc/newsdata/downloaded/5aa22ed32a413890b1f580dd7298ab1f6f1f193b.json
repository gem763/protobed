We\u2019re both in our late 40s and have been married for more than 20 years.\n\nThings haven\u2019t been right for a while. The spark has gone out and we never spend quality time together. I just feel miserable, so I suggested we tried counselling. He took some persuading. However, it\u2019s not gone the way I hoped it would. For starters, I cannot stand the female counsellor \u2014 she is much harsher on me than my husband. She always seems to take his side. It makes me so angry. Part of the problem is I feel put upon by him \u2014 and now by her, too. Last week, after four sessions, I tried to bring it up with my husband, but he said I was imagining things.\n\nAn anonymous reader asked TV's Steph and Dom Parker for advice on seeing a counsellor with her husband (file image)\n\nNo surprise, he is finding it extremely helpful, and wants to carry on seeing her.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSTEPH SAYS: It\u2019s a scenario many of us know well \u2014 you\u2019ve been married for ever, the spark has gone, you\u2019re not enjoying each other\u2019s company and life feels a bit bleak.\n\nThere are countless couples around the country who have felt like that, who have spent all their time being focused on getting to the next stage of life, on living not on loving.\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to forget about the person next to you when you\u2019re busily getting on with things, so good for you for being pro-active and trying to improve your relationship.\n\nAnd congratulations on getting your husband to go with you for counselling. Persuading a man to agree to see a therapist is incredibly hard \u2014 so well done to you!\n\nSeeking marriage counselling is, in my book, always a good thing. But, and it\u2019s a big but, it is often recommended that you meet a couple of therapists before you commit to your choice. They are people, after all, and they have to be a good fit for you \u2014 both of you.\n\nPerhaps what happened is that you went along and, grateful that you had managed to get your husband there, simply ticked the box and showed up to your next appointment without really considering if the woman you were meeting was the best person to help.\n\nSteph (pictured with Dom) told the reader to book a session to see their counsellor alone, as an opportunity to express her feelings\n\nAnd who knows, maybe she has formed too close a bond to your husband? Maybe she really does favour him? Maybe he even likes her a little too much, too \u2014 I can\u2019t know because I\u2019m not in the room with the three of you. But what I do know is that you seem very unhappy. You don\u2019t like him. You don\u2019t like her. Might it be that you don\u2019t like yourself very much either?\n\nAre you cross with yourself because your relationship is not working? Perhaps you\u2019re terrified things might be ending?\n\nI think you have to be very honest with yourself as to why you don\u2019t like her.\n\nAre you sure it\u2019s not you, you hate?\n\nIs she simply the scapegoat for your fear and insecurity? The force of your feelings makes me think that, deep down, you still love your husband.\n\nSo how to solve this? Well, I think it would be a good idea to book in for a session alone with her. Tell her what you\u2019re feeling. She won\u2019t be the first \u2014 or the last \u2014 counsellor to hear this, I\u2019m sure. Talk it through with her and see if there\u2019s any truth in what you\u2019re saying. Then decide how to proceed.\n\nIf this is your problem, then you must stop beating up everyone else. If it\u2019s not? Well, there are plenty of counsellors out there, but only one husband.\n\nDOM SAYS: Well, I must say, I\u2019ve never come across this one before.\n\nAnd I\u2019d like to say \u2018thank you\u2019 for writing in, as I suspect it took a bit of courage. This is quite something to admit to.\n\nI\u2019d also like to congratulate you on taking the massive step of going to couples\u2019 counselling after 20 years of marriage, as I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t easy either.\n\nWhenever people do go for counselling, I believe the general recommendation is that the therapist should be carefully chosen and there should be an initial meeting to see whether you get along.\n\nDom (pictured) urged the reader to consider if her counsellor is telling an unpalatable truth or two\n\nAfter all, it is perfectly possible that you just don\u2019t like the cut of someone\u2019s jib, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that!\n\nSo it\u2019s a bit of a shame that this didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBut, having chosen this person, and committed to this path, it seems only correct to try to make things work.\n\nOne thing I feel is important to point out here is that, in general, counsellors are people who are professional and well-behaved. So it does seem unlikely that she would be unfairly siding with your husband and picking on you!\n\nYou may not want to hear this, but I suspect it\u2019s far more likely that, having chosen to go and do this \u2014 and convinced your husband to do it \u2014 you simply don\u2019t like the direction things are taking.\n\nYou say in your letter that you feel \u2018put upon\u2019 by your husband and now by the counsellor, too.\n\nI know that finger-pointing is not what\u2019s supposed to happen in these sessions.\n\nThe bitterest pill is the best remedy\n\nBut, fundamentally, someone is going to be told they\u2019re not trying hard enough. That they\u2019re not putting in enough effort. And, dare I say it? Perhaps you\u2019re being told that the problems in your marriage are more your fault than your husband\u2019s?\n\nMy guess is you don\u2019t like what\u2019s been said and you\u2019ve simply taken umbrage.\n\nI can see how it would happen, especially if you feel your husband is just sitting there, smugly.\n\nOf course, only you will know deep down in your heart whether this is true.\n\nBut I urge you to ask yourself if you\u2019re really sure this woman is not telling you an unpalatable truth or two.\n\nIf so, then grow up and don\u2019t sling the baby out with the bath water.\n\nYou can\u2019t stand her? Good! She\u2019s probably telling you things you need to hear!\n\nDon\u2019t forget \u2014 it\u2019s often said that the bitterest pill is the best remedy.\n\nIf you have a question you\u2019d like Steph and Dom to tackle, write to: stephanddom@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "An anonymous reader asked TV's Steph and Dom Parker for advice on visiting a counsellor who always seems to take her husband's side.
