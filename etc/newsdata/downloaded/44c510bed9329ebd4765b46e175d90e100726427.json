It was a 4-3 victory on Oct. 17, 1995. Dallas was 13-0-4 in that stretch.\n\nWilson\u2019s tally came on a rebound during a four-minute high-sticking penalty against rookie Joel Hanley just 52 seconds into the game. Kuznetsov skated in untouched early the third period after a holding call against Hanley.\n\nThe Capitals killed all six of their penalties as the Stars dropped to 1 of 20 on the power play this season.\n\nSamsonov stopped the first 19 shots before Radek Faksa rammed in a wraparound midway through the third. Samsonov finished with 24 saves and has stopped 49 of 51 shots in two starts.\n\nAnton Khudobin had 21 saves in his second start, including against Alex Ovechkin alone in front in the second period. Ovechkin scored an empty-netter in the final minute.\n\nJoel Pavelski, the free agent pickup expected to boost Dallas\u2018 scoring, is still looking for his first goal. He was denied by Samsonov on a point blank try late in the first period.\n\nThe Stars spent most of the first five minutes on the penalty kill. After Wilson\u2019s goal on a rebound, Dallas challenged a no-call on a hand pass. The challenge failed, and the Stars were assessed a delay of game under the new rule. The Stars killed the second penalty.\n\nAfter those two calls, it was Washington\u2019s turn to kill penalties - six in a row over the rest of the first period and the second. Wilson was called for tripping and high-sticking during that stretch.\n\nJohn Carlson had Washington\u2019s other goal when a failed breakout by Dallas turned into a 4-on-1 for the Capitals.\n\nNOTES: The teams met for the second time in less than a week to complete the season series. Dallas\u2018 only victory of the season was 4-3 in overtime at Washington on Tuesday. \u2026 Carlson, who also had an assist, entered the game leading all NHL defensemen with eight points. He\u2019s up to 10 with two goals and eight assists.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCapitals: Colorado on Monday to start three-game homestand.\n\nStars: At Buffalo on Monday to start four-game trip.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tom Wilson and Evgeny Kuznetsov scored power-play goals, rookie goalie Ilya Samsonov won again in his second career start and the Washington Capitals beat the Stars 4-1 on Saturday night for their first regulation victory in Dallas in 24 years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/capitals_stars_hockey_91525_c0-424-5558-3666_s1200x700.jpg?3c247c8058abbf9efb64da2704d849e84f689cb3", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
