Was it worth it to rip your family apart for this? Because it wouldn\u2019t be for me.\u201d\n\nMore recently, McCain called Kellyanne Conway\u2019s question about a critical reporter\u2019s ethnicity \u201cabhorrent.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry, McCain attempted to explain on Tuesday\u2019s episode of The View why Conway and other aides to the president have been and will remain so loyal to him despite his alleged crimes.\n\n\u201cIf you're in the White House and your surrogates are bombing left and right and making complete jackasses of themselves, going viral with their explanations, you have to try and retake the narrative,\u201d McCain said, adding, \u201cThe problem with Republicans and the White House right now is the narrative is completely spun out of control in every way.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk about blowing it on a J.V. level,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you have something to tell me that explains why you don't think this is unethical or illegal, please get somebody out there with more than three brain cells to explain it to Republicans. But Stephen Miller and Rudy Giuliani are making this exponentially worse and now Mike Pompeo just made it exponentially worse.\u201d\n\nThis led Joy Behar to wonder why a \u201csmart guy\u201d like Pompeo or Attorney General Bill Barr are ruining their own reputations to protect Trump. \u201cI understand why Lindsey Graham is selling his soul, he wants to be re-elected in South Carolina,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't get what the motive is to lie down with this dog and get up with fleas. I don't really see why they do it.\u201d\n\nThough Conway had not been part of the conversation to that point, McCain answered Behar\u2019s question with, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but without Trump, Kellyanne Conway is just another chick on cable news.\u201d When Behar said, \u201cBut we\u2019re not talking about her,\u201d McCain replied, \u201cStephen Miller is just another dude, I don\u2019t know where he birthed from\u201d before adding, \u201cA lot of these people will not have the same kind of reputation or power that they do working in the White House right now.\u201d\n\nAfter Abby Huntsman named former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as an example of someone who left the White House before \u201cselling his soul,\u201d Whoopi Goldberg chimed in with, \u201cIt took them a long time to figure out that they weren't willing to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would follow Mattis into hell,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI love that guy.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but without Trump, Kellyanne Conway is just another chick on cable news,\u201d the \u201cView\u201d host said.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2558,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569946428/MM_ql3jeo", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
