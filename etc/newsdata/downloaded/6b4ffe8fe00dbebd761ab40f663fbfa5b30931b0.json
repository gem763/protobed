When an employee spends their own money on education, their company can reimburse them tax-free, thanks to Section 127 of the federal tax code. And when an employee has student loans and the company offers to repay a portion of it, those dollars are treated as taxable income.\n\nHowever, Congress is trying to fix that.\n\nThe \u201cEmployer Participation in Repayment Act,\u201d which is currently working its way through lawmakers in the House and Senate, hopes to expand the existing tax-free assistance program \u201cto allow employers to contribute tax-free dollars towards their employees\u2019 student loans.\u201d\n\nDavid Klein, CEO of New York-based student loan startup CommonBond Founder, asserted to Yahoo Finance that \u201cthe power of this is massive.\u201d\n\nThe one-page summary of the bill states: \u201cModernizing the program to better meet the needs of today\u2019s workers would help individuals pay down their student loans and serve as a recruitment and retention tool for younger employees who are typically not large consumers of health care, retirement, and insurance benefits.\u201d\n\nParade participants protesting against high student loan burdens are preparing to take part in the annual July 4th parade at Ashland, Oregon, U.S. on July 4, 2015.

That number has doubled since 2018.\n\n\u201cWhat's interesting is that \u2026 a lot of employers are telling us that this is something they want to be able to do for their employees as a way to attract and retain top talent,\u201d said Klein. \u201cBut many of them say that unless and until there's beneficial tax treatment, they're going to stay on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nThe average student borrower holds about $28,650 in debt, according to Student Loan Hero. Increasing delinquencies are hurting borrowers materially, as they fall behind on major life milestones like buying a house or getting married.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, employers can help borrowers by offering to pay about $100 a month per employee on their loans. Over 12 months, that comes up to $1,200. Over 10 years, that\u2019s $12,000 \u2014 a substantial amount for someone holding $30,000 in student debt.\n\nPasadena City College graduation ceremony, June 14, 2019, in Pasadena, California.

It actually looks a lot like something we\u2019ve already had, and know well: 401ks.\n\n\u201cWe started calling this the 401k for student loans internally about three years ago because we think that's a really easy way for people's minds to really grasp what this really is,\u201d explained Klein. \u201cAt the time, the country was moving from company-guaranteed pensions to more market-based 401ks.\u201d\n\nToday, \u201cin the case of student debt, we're moving from a world where college didn't used to cost as much as it used to,\u201d he added. \u201cNow it costs a lot of money. \u2026. [and so] there is a need in the market to solve that and one of the ways ... is to garner private sector participation in the pay down of employees' student debt over time.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cEmployer Participation in Repayment Act,\u201d which is currently working its way through lawmakers in the House and Senate, hopes to expand the existing tax-free assistance program \u201cto allow employers to contribute tax-free dollars towards their employees\u2019 student loans.\u201d", "authors": ["Aarthi Swaminathan", "Finance Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1Yl01NPrX7CNzWxDbZMjxQ--~B/aD0yNDA0O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/3530c860-b49f-11e9-a5fe-2e08a1fe0701", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
