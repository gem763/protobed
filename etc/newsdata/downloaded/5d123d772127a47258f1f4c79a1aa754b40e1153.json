(Damian Dovarganes/AP)\n\nProminent Democratic donor and LGBT activist Ed Buck has been charged with running a drug house after a man overdosed last week at his West Hollywood home, the third overdose there since 2017, the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office announced Tuesday night. The unnamed man survived, while the other two men died.\n\nBuck, 65, is accused in court documents of being a \u201cviolent, dangerous sexual predator\u201d who targeted men \u201cmade vulnerable by addiction and homelessness\u201d by administering them large doses of narcotics as part of his \u201csexual fetishes.\u201d Prosecutors say he continued to inject men with drugs even after the two deaths at his home, which occurred in July 2017 and January 2019.\n\nAfter the most recent overdose, Buck is charged with maintaining a drug house, battery causing serious injury and administering methamphetamine, all felonies. The two deaths remain under investigation, a Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office spokesman said via email.\n\n\u201cI remain deeply concerned for the safety of people whose life circumstances may make them more vulnerable to criminal predators,\u201d Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement. \u201cWith this new evidence, I authorized the filing of criminal charges against Ed Buck.\u201d\n\nProsecutors will ask a judge to set bond at $4 million Wednesday morning, seeking to \u201cstop this terrifying saga of predatory behavior,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cThe defendant\u2019s predatory acts and willful disregard for human life must be stopped before another life is lost,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nAn attorney for Buck did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.\n\nBuck, a former fashion model and well-known LGBT activist in Los Angeles, has donated thousands to Democrats including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Rep. Ted Lieu (Calif.). Lieu said earlier this year he would donate more than $18,000 in contributions he received from Buck to LGBTQ and African American civil rights organizations.\n\nUntil the first man\u2019s death at his home in 2017, Buck served on the Stonewall Democratic Club steering committee, and also ran for West Hollywood City Council, CBS Los Angeles reported.\n\nSome activists started to demand Buck\u2019s arrest after the deaths of two black men in his home.\n\nIn the first case, 26-year-old Gemmel Moore died of a methamphetamine overdose in Buck\u2019s apartment in July 2017. He was found naked on a mattress in the living room with syringes, sex toys and other drug paraphernalia nearby, prosecutors wrote in Tuesday\u2019s court documents. The death was ultimately ruled accidental \u2014 but Moore\u2019s mother, LaTisha Nixon, drew scrutiny to the case after questioning whether Buck may have administered the drugs to her son.\n\nIn his journal, the Los Angeles Times reported, Moore appeared to write: \u201cI\u2019ve become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of chrystal meth.\"\n\nAlmost one year after Moore\u2019s death, prosecutors announced they did not have enough evidence to file charges against Buck.\n\nThe second man died six months later, in January 2019.\n\nTimothy Dean, 55, was found in strikingly similar circumstances, half-naked with his legs resting on a living room mattress and the rest of his body on the floor. As in Moore\u2019s case, syringes, sex toys and other drug paraphernalia were found strewn around the room, prosecutors said.\n\nOutrage exploded over the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s previous decision to decline to charge Buck. Within six weeks, 30,000 people signed a petition demanding his arrest, led by the social justice activist group Color of Change.\n\nNixon filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Buck and the district attorney, arguing that Dean wouldn\u2019t have died had Buck been charged in her son\u2019s death. She accused Buck of preying on black men and soliciting them for sex, only to force them into drug-fueled sexual encounters while they were dangerously intoxicated. And she accused prosecutors of failing to more aggressively investigate Buck because he was a wealthy, politically connected white man with vulnerable black victims.\n\n\u201cIf the dead body of a blond-haired, blue-eyed white man was found in the home of an older black man, he\u2019d be lucky to even make it to the police station alive,\u201d said Hussain Turk, Nixon\u2019s attorney, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nBuck also was not charged in Dean\u2019s death. His attorney, Seymour Amster, has repeatedly insisted that Buck had nothing to do with either man\u2019s death, arguing that both were tragic accidents.\n\nBut on Tuesday, prosecutors echoed Nixon\u2019s accusations, saying Buck\u2019s \u201cmalevolent behavior\u201d directly led to the two men\u2019s deaths. In the motion to set his bail at $4 million, prosecutors describe a pattern of \u201cpredatory acts,\u201d culminating with the third victim\u2019s near-fatal overdose last week.\n\n\u201cUsing the bait of narcotics, money, and shelter, the defendant lures these vulnerable victims to his home,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the motion. \u201cFrom his home, in a position of power, Buck manipulates his victims into participating in his sexual fetishes. These fetishes include supplying and personally administering dangerously large doses of narcotics to his victims.\u201d\n\nIn the third case, prosecutors say Buck administered one of these dangerous methamphetamine doses to \u201cJoe Doe\u201d on Sept. 4. Doe left Buck\u2019s apartment to get medical attention, fearing he was overdosing.\n\nBut Doe returned to Buck\u2019s apartment the next week, on Sept. 11. That day, Buck injected Doe with another dangerous dose of meth, prosecutors say. Doe felt himself overdosing again \u2014 but this time Buck \u201crefused to render aid\u201d to Doe and instead \u201cthwarted Doe\u2019s attempts to get help,\u201d according to the motion.\n\nThe man finally fled Buck\u2019s apartment to call 911 from a nearby gas station. He was transported to a hospital.\n\nProsecutors said of Buck that the \u201cfull scope of his consistent malicious behavior is unknown.\u201d During the investigation of all three incidents, prosecutors said the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department found hundreds of photos taken in Buck\u2019s apartment \u201cof men in compromising positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is only a matter of time before another one of these vulnerable young men dies of an overdose,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nBuck is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges Wednesday morning.", "description": "Prosecutors say Ed Buck was injecting men with large amounts of narcotics as part of a sexual fetish, allegedly preying on men \"made vulnerable by addiction and homelessness.\"", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
