After three missions to orbit, Dr. Kavandi moved into NASA administration, eventually overseeing how astronauts were selected. She\u2019s credited with adding fairness to a process that for the first time chose an astronaut class that included as many women as men.\n\nSo when Dr. Kavandi, 60, retired on Monday as director of Glenn Research Center, a Cleveland, Ohio facility that designs innovative technologies for NASA, she le ft not only a legacy in human spaceflight, but also a moon-sized hole for the agency to fill.\n\nRoger Handberg, a space policy expert at the University of Central Florida, called her a role model for women serving in leadership roles at NASA in the future.", "description": "Janet Kavandi, who recently retired from a senior NASA post, went to space three times and added fairness to the astronaut selection process.", "authors": ["Jillian Kramer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/science/00SCI-KAVANDI1/00SCI-KAVANDI1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
