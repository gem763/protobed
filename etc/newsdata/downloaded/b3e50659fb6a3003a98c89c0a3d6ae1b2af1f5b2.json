He said he\u2019s awaiting word from Saudi Arabia about who it believed caused the attack and \u201cunder what terms we would proceed!\u201d\n\nSeveral administration officials said Sunday that they had substantial evidence that Iran was behind the attack, not the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who claimed responsibility. On Saturday, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said unequivocally in a tweet that Iran was to blame.\n\nTwo administration officials who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations told reporters that cruise missiles may have been used in the attacks on a Saudi oil field and the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing facility in Abqaiq. The range from Yemen was also far beyond the distance of anything the Houthis have ever done, the officials said.\n\nA third administration official, who also asked not to be identified discussing non-public findings, said precision-guided munitions had been used. The U.S. officials didn\u2019t rule out that armed drones were used as well, even as they rejected the Houthi claims that they mounted the attacks using such pilotless aircraft.\n\nNow, the challenge that Trump and his advisers face is balancing a tough response to what it says is a clear act of of Iranian aggression, against concern that it\u2019s rushing headlong into a conflict that could spiral out of control. Analysts also warn that doing nothing could send a message to Iran or its proxy militias across the Middle East that they can strike their enemies with impunity.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no great response here,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThe question becomes how does the U.S. navigate between not allowing this precedent to stand on one hand, and avoiding a punitive escalation or one designed to deter future attacks without an escalation. And the answer is there is no answer.\u201d\n\nStill, a major U.S. military response may be unlikely, according to experts who said they doubt Trump will be willing to use force against Tehran or risk escalating violence in the Middle East ahead of the 2020 presidential election. In June, Trump said he considered a military strike on Iran for shooting down a U.S. drone, only to call off the action at the last minute.\n\nAnalysts also said the attacks may do little to deter the president from seeking a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an effort to broker a new nuclear agreement.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t ruled out a possible meeting with Rouhani when both are in New York in a week for the annual United Nations General Assembly. He tweeted on Sunday that the \u201cFake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u2018No Conditions\u2019 That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).\u201d But officials including Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have told reporters publicly that Trump is willing to take a meeting with no conditions.\n\n\u2018Maximum Pressure\u2019\n\nThe administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d stance against Iran is focused on imposing sanctions and isolating the country over its nuclear ambitions and malign activities in the region. That approach has come under renewed scrutiny at a time the president\u2019s foreign policy team is in flux, after Trump\u2019s firing of hawkish National Security Adviser John Bolton last week.\n\nU.S. and Saudi officials say they\u2019re gathering more evidence that Iran was behind the attacks -- some of it on the ground in Saudi Arabia -- that will be released in due time. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry described Pompeo\u2019s comments blaming the Islamic Republic as \u201cblind and fruitless accusations.\u201d\n\nAccording to U.S. government information, there were 19 points of attack at state-owned Saudi Aramco\u2019s crude-processing facility at Abqaiq and the Khurais oil field, all on the north or northwest-facing sides -- suggesting that the weaponry used came from that direction. Iraq lies to the north, and the U.S. in the past has accused Iran of stashing explosives with affiliated militias in the country. Yemen, by contrast, is hundreds of miles to the south.\n\nSaudi Aramco lost roughly 5.7 million barrels per day of output after the attacks, although officials cited progress in restoring production.\n\nPompeo\u2019s Tweet\n\nPompeo tweeted Saturday that there is \u201cno evidence the attacks came from Yemen\u201d and accused Iran of being behind \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression,\u201d he added.\n\nPaul Pillar, a former U.S. Central Intelligence Agency officer, said the one \u201cpolicy option left is de-escalation -- of the Saudi air war against Yemen, and of the Trump administration\u2019s economic war against Iran.\u201d\n\nPillar, who\u2019s now a non-resident senior fellow at Georgetown University in Washington, said \u201cfurther attempts to escalate on either of those war fronts offers no reason to believe that they would be any more successful than the wars have been up to this point.\u201d\n\nTrump would risk criticism from many of his Republican allies if he chose to meet with Iran\u2019s leader barely a week after accusing the country of being responsible for a strike that caused a significant disruption to the world\u2019s oil markets. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina has said the U.S. shouldn\u2019t rule out a military strike on Iranian oil facilities in response.\n\nGraham Tweet\n\n\u201cIran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries, which will break the regime\u2019s back,\u201d Graham tweeted Saturday.\n\nOne Western diplomat, who asked not to be identified, said Trump sees what he wants to see in world events, so if he wanted to meet with Iran\u2019s president, the strikes wouldn\u2019t necessarily deter him. Trump has repeatedly brushed aside short-range missile tests by North Korea as he seeks to broker a historic nuclear pact with leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nWhite House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the administration will continue its \u201cmaximum pressure campaign,\u201d but she added that \u201cthe president will always consider his options,\u201d including a meeting with Rouhani. That was hours before Trump seemed to rule out a meeting unless the Iranian president met unspecified conditions.\n\nUN Meeting\n\nNor is it clear the Iranian leader would be willing to take such a meeting -- even an informal chat on the sidelines of the UN gathering -- without the U.S. making some gesture to ease its sanctions on his country. The strikes in Saudi Arabia may all but rule out such a move anytime soon despite pleas by Western leaders led by French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe attacks on Saudi Arabia also pose a major test for Pompeo, who has an opportunity to consolidate power after Bolton\u2019s departure.\n\nPompeo and Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran, have argued the U.S. could afford to ramp up sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Iran because there\u2019s plenty of global oil supply. But there\u2019s now little cushion in the market with the major disruption caused by the drone attacks, which could force the president and his team to look for ways to relieve the pressure.\n\nWhile analysts estimate Saudi Arabia may be able to restore half of the lost production as early as Monday, Trump said on Twitter Sunday that he\u2019s authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed based on the attacks \u201cin a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.\u201d The stock of about 645 million barrels of crude and petroleum products could help meet demand during the time it would take for the Saudis to repair the facilities. Trump also told U.S. agencies to expedite approvals of oil pipelines in the permitting process.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of the administration\u2019s credibility. Some foreign policy analysts said it\u2019s hard to take at face value the claim that Tehran is responsible, given the hard line against Iran advocated by Pompeo, Bolton and others.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration appears to have evidence of Iranian responsibility but will face skepticism from others, both because of policy disagreements between the US and its allies, and because declining to attribute an attack provides an excuse not to respond,\u201d tweeted Michael Singh, managing director for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.", "description": "Trump Vows U.S. \u2018Locked and Loaded\u2019 If Iran Was Behind Attacks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice10119c1cf3de4b7e99b31c1c0eab1ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
