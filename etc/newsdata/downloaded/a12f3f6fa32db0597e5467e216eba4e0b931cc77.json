Greg Steube (R-FL) on Sunday said on the Fox News Channel that Democrats \u201cwill stop at nothing to impeach\u201d President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to Steube, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing\u201d worthy of impeachment done by Trump in the latest contrived controversy over his phone call the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats will stop at nothing to impeach this president,\u201d Steube stated. \u201cFirst, it was the Russia collusion hoax. And the American people dealt with that fraud upon the American people for about two and a half years. And then, after the Mueller report came out, it specifically said there was no collusion. Then the Democrats moved from the collusion narrative to obstruction of justice. Then we moved from that corruption, from that to now this phone call with the Ukrainian president. I mean, it\u2019s clear that the Democrats will stop at nothing to impeach this president.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "With impeachment talk continuing to dominate discussion among Democrats, Rep.
