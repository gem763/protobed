Paramedics arrived and gave first aid but he died at St Thomas\u2019s hospital 45 minutes later, according to The Guardian.\n\nOn Friday, assistant coroner Briony Ballard called Carey\u2019s death a tragedy.\n\nRELATED: New Peanut Allergy Drug Looks Like a \u2018Breakthrough\u2019 for People with Life-Threatening Reactions\n\nYui Mok/AP Images More\n\n\u201cThe deceased made serving staff aware of his allergies. The menu was reassuring in that it made no reference to any marinade or potential allergenic ingredient in the food selected,\u201d Ballard concluded the investigation in a statement read at Southwark Coroner\u2019s Court, according to CNN.\n\n\u201cThe deceased was not informed that there were allergens in the order. The food served to and consumed by the deceased contained dairy which caused the deceased to suffer a severe anaphylactic reaction from which he died,\u201d Ballard\u2019s statement added.\n\nRELATED: Mom Says Teen Sons Were Kicked Off Flight After Asking the Crew to Accommodate Peanut Allergy\n\nThe investigation and verdict were validating for Carey\u2019s family, who said they knew their son would have taken every precaution while eating out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very glad the coroner saw that and took it on board, because it was important to us that Owen said what he said at the restaurant,\u201d Paul Carey, Owen\u2019s father, told the BBC. \u201cHe knew exactly what he could and couldn\u2019t eat, and I think it\u2019s because we had drilled it into him from an early age.\u201d\n\nThe family is now calling for a new law to require allergen labeling on all restaurant menus to prevent a similar tragedy from happening in the future.\n\n\u201cOwen was the shining light in our family. We are calling on the Government to change the law on allergen labeling in restaurants,\u201d his family said in a statement on Friday, according to the PA. \u201cWe want restaurants to have to display clear allergen information on each individual dish on their menus. The food industry should put the safety of their customers first.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cIt is simply not good enough to have a policy which relies on verbal communication between the customer and their server, which often takes places in a busy, noisy restaurant where the turnover of staff is high and many of their customers are very young.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Minnesota Toddler Is Allergic to Water \u2014 Including Her Own Tears: \u2018We\u2019re Scared for Her Future\u2019\n\nAlso attending the court ruling on Friday were the parents of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died at 15 after eating an unlabeled sesame seed Pret a Manger baguette in 2016 at Heathrow airport while on her way to France.\n\nThey called Friday\u2019s verdict a \u201clandmark judgment.\u201d", "description": "Teenager Died Eating Burger Informed Staff About Allergy", "authors": ["Claudia Harmata"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qUeLfPq0YqYyf4zerZo2uw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/224dd2398d5e0ac5771a395072553bfe", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
