Instead, Nevada would award its six electors to whomever receives the most votes across the entire country.\n\nAccording to the National Popular Vote organization, which oversees efforts to persuade states to join the compact, 14 states and the District of Columbia have agreed to pledge their 189 electors to the winner of the national popular vote \u2014 regardless of which candidate won the state. Nevada's electoral votes would bring the total to 195. Once 270 electors are pledged, the compact would kick in.\n\nAs the Electoral College comes under greater scrutiny, there are movements to give more weight to the popular vote. Democrats in particular have been stung by the Electoral College's vote count, which effectively gives disproportional power to smaller, rural states that tend to vote Republican. In addition to President Trump, George W. Bush also won the White House without winning the popular vote.\n\nNevada's Senate voted 12-8 to join the agreement, entirely along party lines. Every Republican voted against the proposal. Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, has not indicated whether he will sign the measure into law.\n\nAs NPR has reported, the popular vote movement seems to be gathering steam. In February, 11 states were on board. Since then, Colorado, Delaware and New Mexico have signed on.\n\nBut critics of the effort say it could make rural states irrelevant in choosing the president and would give even more power to highly-populated states like California and New York. Presidential candidates might even forgo campaigning in many states, they say.\n\n\"If we go to a national popular vote, why would they even bother coming here? Our Constitution says we're a republic, not a democracy,\" Nevada Assemblyman Jim Wheeler said last month, according to The Washington Times. \"I voted 'no.' \"", "description": "The state Senate voted along party lines to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which would give the state's six electoral votes to the winner of the presidential popular vote.", "authors": ["Matthew S.
