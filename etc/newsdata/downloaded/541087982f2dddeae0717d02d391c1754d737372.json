The PKK and YPG are Kurdish organizations Turkey classifies as terror groups.\n\nErdogan continued, \u201c#OperationPeaceSpring will neutralize terror threats against Turkey and lead to the establishment of a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes.\u201d\n\nAirstrikes were reported near the Turkish-Syrian border moments after Erdogan\u2019s announcement, according to the AFP. The Dubai-based Al-Arabiya reported that Kurdish forces had called on the U.S. and Europe to impose a no-fly zone over the area.\n\nAbout 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently reside in Turkey, having fled the Syrian civil war. Turkey aims to resettle these refugees in Syria\u2019s northeast, which Kurdish residents say is really an attempt to weaken them demographically by flooding the region with Sunni Arabs.\n\nOn Monday, President Trump announced his intention to pull back American troops from the Syrian-Turkish border in anticipation of Turkey\u2019s planned incursion. The announcement drew bipartisan fury in Washington for effectively abandoning Kurdish combatants, who had fought in the American coalition to defeat ISIS.\n\nThe Trump administration confirmed on Tuesday that Trump was set to host Erdogan at the White House for a state visit later this month.\n\nTrump has defended his decision to pull back U.S. troops, saying that the military is not abandoning the Kurds, \u201cwho are special people and wonderful fighters.\u201d He also threatened to \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if Erdogan did anything he considered to be \u201coff limits.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration confirmed on Tuesday that Trump was set to host Erdogan at the White House for a state visit later this month.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
