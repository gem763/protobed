Yet Labour lost seats \u2013 more than 20 of them \u2013 in this week\u2019s polls.\n\nYou have to go back to 1985 \u2013 when Labour was tearing itself apart over hard-Left group Militant \u2013 to find an Opposition losing seats in English council elections.\n\nBut the figures are, in fact, worse for Labour than this. Because when an Opposition party has a new leader \u2013 as they have with Mr Corbyn \u2013 the average gains are 515 seats.\n\nThe Conservatives even managed to gain 256 council seats in 1998, when Tony Blair was at the height of his popularity. They won a further 1,344 in 1999, with Labour losing 1,161.\n\nEven Michael Foot\u2019s first local elections as party leader in 1981 saw Labour gain 988 \u2013 and he was the least successful Labour leader of modern times.\n\nIn contrast, Mr Corbyn has gone backwards and suffered losses.\n\nTrue, Labour managed to remain the largest party in Wales \u2013 but fell short of an overall majority as Ukip ate into its core vote, gaining seven seats. Meanwhile, in Scotland, there was utter devastation for the party slumped to its worst result since 1910. Labour\u2019s vote share was down by 9 percentage points \u2013 with the loss of 13 seats.\n\nHumiliatingly, the Tories pushed them into third place.\n\nChancellor George Osborne\u2019s analysis yesterday was that Labour is finished in Scotland and, therefore, no longer capable of forming a majority Government in the UK.\n\nOnly by forming an alliance with the SNP does it have any chance of running Britain \u2013 and the public flatly rejected that idea at the 2015 general election.\n\nThe only reason that Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell was able to claim, with a straight face, that Labour had enjoyed a \u2018good night\u2019 was because expectations had been so dramatically downplayed in recent weeks. It did not lose the 150-175 English council seats predicted by some analysts.\n\nBut if restricting the party\u2019s losses to double-digits \u2013 when historic precedent suggests it should have made huge gains \u2013 is a good night\u2019s work, the party is in a very, very dark place indeed.\n\nLabour managed to remain the largest party in Wales \u2013 but fell short of an overall majority as Ukip ate into its core vote, gaining seven seats\n\nNarrowly, it was ahead of the Tories in the national vote share. According to BBC projections for England, Labour are on 31 per cent with the Conservatives on 30 per cent. In 2012 Labour was at 38 per cent, and the Tories at 31 per cent.\n\nAnd the Labour leadership let it be known that the results were sufficient see off any threat of an immediate coup. Tory moderates said themselves that Mr Corbyn has another 12 months in the job.\n\nBut in truth there never really was the prospect of the rebels striking now, as they have two major problems to overcome.\n\nThe first is that, while Mr Corbyn has the backing of hundreds of thousands of party members, any coup attempt would be futile.\n\nTeam Corbyn are adamant that, legally, he would make it on to the ballot in any leadership contest and win again.\n\nSecond, where is the candidate around whom the moderates are uniting?\n\nThe two names in the frame are Angela Eagle and Dan Jarvis but there is no strategy for getting them elected \u2013 just a seething contempt for the man who currently holds the job, which many of them so publicly laid bare yesterday on the TV and radio.\n\nWhile Mr Corbyn has the backing of hundreds of thousands of party members, any coup attempt would be futile.\n\nWhat state the party and its \u2018brand\u2019 \u2013 so painstakingly repaired by Neil Kinnock, John Smith and Tony Blair \u2013 will be in this time next year is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nStill to come, remember, is the madness of the party tearing itself apart over a vote on replacing Trident \u2013 not to mention who knows how many more anti-semitism scandals.\n\nCertainly, the night was not without some pain for David Cameron, whose share of the vote fell in the south east. Councils he might have expected to turn blue did not materialise.\n\nBut, given that he is six years into his premiership, in the grip of a bruising internal battle over Europe, and coming off the back of a botched Budget, the Prime Minister should have been drubbed.\n\nInstead, he could trumpet not only the incredible story north of the border, but also the news of seats gained in places such as Peterborough, Nuneaton and Bury \u2013 all of them key election battlegrounds.", "description": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s (pictured) own rather desperate analysis of the election results was that Labour \u2018hung on\u2019.
