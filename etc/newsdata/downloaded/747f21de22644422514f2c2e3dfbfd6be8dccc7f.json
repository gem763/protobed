The company says it\u2019s standard procedure.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nWorkers demonstrate Tuesday outside a General Motors facility in Langhorne, Pa. (Matt Rourke/AP)\n\nGeneral Motors has dropped health-care plans for tens of thousands of striking workers about two days into the stoppage, a move that underscored tensions between the two sides.\n\nThe United Auto Workers, which represents the roughly 49,000 workers whose walkout has effectively halted GM\u2019s production in the United States, released an internal letter Tuesday that said that it had been given notice that the company had stopped health-care benefits because of the strike.\n\nThe UAW said that it would \u201cprovide medical assistance,\u201d or cover employees health-care fees under COBRA in the interim from the pool of money it keeps for strikes.\n\nGM spokesman David Barnas said that decision was a standard practice during stoppages, likening it to the cessation of worker paychecks. An explainer about strikes on the UAW\u2019s website does note that it typically pays for worker medical plans in such situations.\n\n\u201cWe understand strikes are difficult and disruptive to families,\u201d GM said in a statement Barnas distributed. \u201cWhile on strike, some benefits shift to being funded by the union\u2019s strike fund, and in this case hourly employees are eligible for union-paid COBRA so their health care benefits can continue.\u201d\n\nEmployee dental and vision plans will not be covered during the strike.\n\nHarley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California at Berkeley, said he believed the mechanics of the move were uncommon.\n\n\u201cIn the past, what the pattern has been is when the strike begins, the company continues the health care but the UAW pays for it through its strike fund,\u201d Shaiken said in a phone interview. \u201cThis time, going to COBRA so quickly is very unusual.\u201d\n\n[GM strike lurches on as Trump and other political leaders watch and wait]\n\nThe switch means that employees will have to be re-enrolled in health-care coverage when the strike ends. Shaiken said it was possible that the UAW had an understanding with GM about the cessation of the health-care plans.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sending a message,\u201d he said of GM. \u201cThis is a public relations risk. With all the [national] focus on health care and concerns over health care, for the company to be oblivious to this ... misses a beat or two, and that could become problematic.\u201d\n\nThe move was another sign of the disconnect underlying the strike, the first at GM since 2007. That stoppage lasted only two days. But the current action unfolds in a more charged political dynamic, with an invigorated left wing increasingly focusing on issues surrounding wages and livability amid a broader debate about economic inequality.\n\nGM workers say they are pushing for a more equitable contract that will guarantee better wages for new hires, stronger health-care benefits and more job security. The car giant has moved to close a handful of production facilities in the United States in recent years despite strong profitability margins.\n\nGM made $8.1 billion in profit after taxes last year but announced the closure of four factories, scuttling thousands of jobs.\n\nGM says it has offered to make $7 billion in investments and create 5,400 jobs, including introducing electric trucks, opening a battery cell manufacturing site and investing in eight existing facilities.\n\nThe 49,000 full-time and temporary workers represented by the UAW make up about half of its workforce.\n\nAnalysts note that American automakers face higher labor costs than foreign car companies that have opened assembly plants in the United States, none of which are unionized.\n\nMedia reports have said that health-care costs form at least part of the contractual dispute between the two sides.\n\nWorkers are forgoing their paychecks during the strike, though the UAW will pay them $250 a week from its strike fund. GM could be losing as much as $50 million to $100 million a day from the stoppage, analysts say.\n\nThe strike has drawn support from Democratic presidential candidates such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Pete Buttigieg. President Trump said he was sad to see the strike and hoped for a quick resolution.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said on Twitter that GM\u2019s move to cut employee health care was a \u201cdirty\u201d tactic.", "description": "\"While on strike, some benefits shift to being funded by the union\u2019s strike fund, and in this case hourly employees are eligible for union-paid COBRA so their health care benefits can continue,\u201d GM said in a statement.", "authors": ["Eli Rosenberg", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "September At Pm", "Eli Rosenberg Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S General Assignment Team.
