Researchers have calculated the going rate for thoughts and prayers offered in hard times.\n\nRather than settling on one price for all, the study found the value of a compassionate gesture depended overwhelmingly on a person\u2019s beliefs. While Christian participants were willing to part with money to receive thoughts and prayers from others, the idea made nonbelievers baulk. Instead of shelling out to receive the gestures, on average they were willing to pay to avoid them.\n\nLinda Thunstr\u00f6m, an economist and an author of the study at the University of Wyoming, said: \u201cThat was a big surprise. Atheists and agnostics are actually willing to give up money to avoid people\u2019s thoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\nThunstr\u00f6m and Shiri Noy, a sociologist at Denison University in Ohio, decided to put a value on \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to help understand the backlash that often follows when prominent figures express their sympathies to communities affected by catastrophes such as mass killings and natural disasters. To some critics, the words are meaningless and at worst detract from practical action that might help prevent further disasters.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focused on 436 residents of North Carolina, the state most affected by Hurricane Florence last year. The participants were given $5 (\u00a34) \u201cin support of their hardship\u201d and asked how much, if any, they were willing to exchange to receive thoughts and prayers from strangers, most of whom were recruited over the internet. When a participant agreed to a price for a gesture, one of the strangers received a note outlining the participant\u2019s struggles and asking them to either pray or have them in their thoughts.\n\nPrayers from a priest were worth $7.17 to the average Christian in need. Prayers from less exalted Christians were valued at $4.36, while mere thoughts from another Christian were cheaper still at $3.27. The researchers used statistical models to estimate prices people would pay above the $5 they had.\n\nAtheists and agnostics, meanwhile, were averse to \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d. On average, they were willing to pay a priest $1.66 not to pray for them, and more than twice that, $3.54, to ensure a run-of-the-mill Christian similarly refrained.\n\n\u2018Thoughts and prayers\u2019 are no match against gun crime in this online game Read more\n\nPublic figures increasingly face criticism for their language around tragedies. \u201cIt may reflect the political climate we are in,\u201d Thunstr\u00f6m said. \u201cSome of these people might feel they hear the phrase \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019 all the time, and perhaps it provokes something in them.\u201d\n\nThe Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein, who was the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under Barack Obama, called the study \u201ca strong and powerful paper\u201d.\n\nIn the aftermath of a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017, Mark Kelly, the husband of the Arizona Democrat Gabby Giffords, who survived a shooting at a constituent meeting in 2011, railed against politicians for their failure to address what he called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of gun violence in the US.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing today at the Capitol and the White House are thoughts and prayers,\u201d he said. \u201cYour thoughts and prayers aren\u2019t going to stop the next shooting. Only action and leadership will do that.\u201d\n\nThunstr\u00f6m said: \u201cThis work helps us understand the contemporary heated debate about these gestures. What our results show is that they have real value to some people, but not to others. These gestures need to be more targeted. If you are talking to a population that is more dominated by nonbelievers, you might not want to suggest a national prayer day.\u201d", "description": "US study finds Christians are willing to pay for prayers \u2013 but atheists will pay to avoid them", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/545708d75d3b4c2a9f0da0dcbfa2e2248231cf4b/0_193_5794_3477/master/5794.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0590196bdfa8a83386006760abc51145", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
