While I was doing errands a few weeks back, I walked past a blue-and-white decorated Greek food truck and a side dish on its menu board caught my eye: fried potatoes with herbs and garlic. I reveled in the thought of that combination as I sauntered on, but as I\u2019d recently made a batch of Loaded Potato Nachos (from my new book), a few blocks later the two concepts collided in my head and the idea for this recipe was born. And boy, am I glad, because it is totally \u201cOpa!\u201d-worthy.\n\nPotato nachos dish up the same fun, crunchy, pile-on-the-goodies, bar-food vibe as typical nachos, but in a better-for-you way because they are made with roasted potatoes rather than with fried chips. Once the thinly sliced potatoes are tossed with a little oil and crisped in a single layer on a sheet pan, they are piled on the same pan to slightly overlap and become a platform for whatever flavors inspire you \u2014 food-truck-derived or otherwise.\n\nHere, the potato \u201cchips\u201d are layered with crumbled feta cheese and returned to the oven until the cheese is warm. They are then showered with scallion, parsley and sliced, jarred hot peppers \u2014 the kind you might find in a Greek salad. Then the whole mess is drizzled with a lemony yogurt sauce that has a whisper of fresh garlic, just enough to give the sauce depth without being too aggressive.\n\nIf you\u2019re having people over, serve the whole shebang right on the sheet pan (try not to get burned) or transfer the \u201cnachos\u201d to a serving platter. But you have permission to be greedy and keep these \u201cnachos\u201d for yourself \u2014 they make a fine dinner side, accompanied by a salad and roasted chicken or fish.\n\nGreek-ish Potato Nachos\n\nMake ahead: The yogurt sauce can be made and stored, covered and refrigerated, for up to 1 day.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing the pan\n\n2 medium russet potatoes (about 10 ounces each) scrubbed, unpeeled\n\n1/4 teaspoon plus a pinch kosher salt, or more as needed\n\n2/3 cup crumbled feta cheese (3 ounces)\n\n2 tablespoons whole or 2-percent plain Greek yogurt\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons water\n\n1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, or more as needed\n\n1/4 teaspoon finely minced garlic (about 1/4 clove)\n\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves\n\n2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions (1 large scallion)\n\n2 tablespoons chopped jarred hot cherry peppers or pepperoncini\n\nSteps\n\nStep 1\n\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Brush a sheet pan with oil.\n\nCut the potatoes crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Place them on the sheet pan; drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil, sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and toss to coat. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on the sheet pan and bake, about 30 minutes, until they are crisp and browned on the bottom and release fairly easily from the baking tray using a metal spatula. (If they do not, return to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes more, until the potato slices do release.) Flip the potatoes, return to the oven and roast for 5 to 10 minutes more, until lightly browned on the other side.\n\nStep 2\n\nUsing tongs, move the potatoes toward the center of the pan, fanning them out so they overlap slightly. Sprinkle the feta cheese over the potatoes and return to the oven for about 5 minutes, until the cheese is warm.\n\nStep 3\n\nWhile the potatoes roast, in a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, water, lemon juice, garlic and a pinch of salt. Taste and season with more lemon juice and/or salt, if desired.\n\nStep 4\n\nUsing a large spatula, transfer the feta-topped potatoes to a platter. (Alternatively, leave them on the sheet pan to serve the nachos from the pan.) Sprinkle with the parsley, scallions and peppers, then drizzle with the yogurt sauce and serve.\n\nFrom nutritionist and cookbook author Ellie Krieger, a registered dietitian nutritionist and author who hosts public television\u2019s \u201cEllie\u2019s Real Good Food.\u201d Her new cookbook \u201cWhole in One: Complete Healthy Meals in a Single Pot, Sheet Pan or Skillet\u201d was recently released.
