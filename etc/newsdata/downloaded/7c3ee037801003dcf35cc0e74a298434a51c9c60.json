Photo: Bashiera Parker)\n\nIn a small room on the fifth floor, I was lucky enough to witness the exchange between Her Royal Highness and 12 women who are changing the world as we know it.\n\nWith the goal of creating opportunities for empowerment through network building between aspiring female entrepreneurs, each woman got to introduce themselves and spoke about what it is they\u2019re doing to influence change, while the duchess listened, engaged, and laughed.\n\n(BEAMING: Matsi Modise. Photo: Bashiera Parker)\n\nI managed to speak to bubbly and beautiful Matsi Modise, the founder of a company called Furaha Afrika Holdings focused on building human capital which includes recruitment, skills training and employee benefits, to name a few.\n\n\"Africa needs a skills revolution,\" she told me, which inspires her every day to do what she does. \"My company, Furaha, which means \u2018happy\u2019 in Swahili, is how we are going to empower Africans with the necessary tools and skills to build its own economies.\n\n\"It\u2019s our time,\" she said.\n\nWhen I asked Matsi what it was like shaking hands with Duchess Meghan, she said, \"I still can\u2019t believe it, I\u2019m not going to wash this hand for a very long time.\n\n\"Phenomenal human being, flawless,\" she gushed.\n\n\"She has an African heart, and she has the power of influence. Her roots come from Africa. I believe this is a time in our lives where we\u2019re going to see real impact.\"\n\nHRH Matsi, as she saved her name on my phone, spoke about one of the many profound things the duchess spoke about.\n\nShe recalled her saying, \"Usually when you\u2019re the first one to climb a mountain, the fall is normally harder, the push back is normally harder. She really looked at us and said, well, you just need to keep on going, keep on pushing because this vision is beyond ourselves.\"\n\nBefore we said our goodbyes I asked Matsi what it was she said that left Her Royal Highness in stitches.\n\nShe threw her head back and laughed once more as she explained the one thing you wouldn\u2019t find on her LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"I love fast cars and I smoke cigars.\"\n\n\"What did she say when you said that?\" I asked, unable to contain myself either at that point.\n\n\"She was just like, 'My goodness. This is interesting.' She was quite shocked because it\u2019s definitely not something you\u2019d expect,\" Matsi said.\n\n\"But she was like, 'Keep on going, girl.'\"\n\nALSO READ: From dancing in Nyanga to Archie's first royal engagement \u2013 Here are 6 stand-out moments from the royal family's tour to SA so far", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex met with a group of inspiring local women in Woodstock on Wednesday afternoon.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9404/1621068732554f9d9691b02138e7055b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
