The bill also provides for sanctions against officials \u201cresponsible for undermining fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nA similar bill is also before the Senate, though the timing of a vote there remains uncertain. The legislation has bipartisan support in both chambers.\n\nThousands of protesters gathered on Monday in Hong Kong\u2019s central district to support the legislation, many of them waving American flags. A spokesman for the Hong Kong government \u201cexpressed regret\u201c over the rally calling for the U.S. legislation\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cHuman rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation. The HKSAR government attaches great importance to them and is determined to safeguard them,\u201d the spokesman said, referring to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\n\u2018Grossly Interferes\u2019\n\nThe Chinese government opposes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, H.R. 3289, saying that it \u201cgrossly interferes in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina strongly urges certain people in the U.S. Congress to grasp the situation, immediately stop advancing the bill regarding Hong Kong and interfering in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs to avoid further damaging China-U.S. relations,\u201d said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe House also passed H.Res. 543, a resolution reaffirming the relationship between the U.S. and Hong Kong, condemning Chinese interference in the region and voicing support for protesters, some of whom have visited Capitol Hill in recent weeks.\n\nThe House plans to vote Tuesday on the Protect Hong Kong Act, H.R. 4270, which would halt the export to Hong Kong of crowd-control devices such as tear gas and rubber bullets. The bill is intended to prevent police in Hong Kong from using those non-lethal weapons on protesters.\n\nThe House will also vote on a resolution introduced by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and top Republican Michael McCaul, which commends the Canadian government for starting extradition proceedings in the U.S. case against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. The resolution, H.Res. 521, also calls for the release of two Canadian nationals and due process for a third sentenced to death for drug smuggling.\n\nRepublican Senators Rick Scott, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley visited Hong Kong over the two-week congressional recess that ended Tuesday. Hawley met with local pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong and got into a back-and-forth with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Hawley said on Twitter that he called Hong Kong a \u201cpolice state\u201d on purpose \u201cbecause that is exactly what Hong Kong is becoming.\u201d", "description": "U.S. House Passes Bill Aimed at Supporting Hong Kong Protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic708bf9cfe0bc19017b146859483e594d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
