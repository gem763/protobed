And in time, it could help more.\n\n\u201cThere is a real positive in this,\u201d said David Chavern, CEO of the News Media Alliance, which represents thousands of newspapers and other news publishers. Positive because this all-powerful tech player is \u201cacknowledging the value of quality journalism and saying that they are willing to pay for it.\u201d\n\nHe worries, though, that the thousands of local newspapers suffering the worst \u2014 and struggling for mere survival \u2014 are being left out of the equation. Facebook\u2019s partners include a few large regional newspapers like the Los Angeles Times but leave out the vast majority.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t end well,\u201d was the blunt forecast of Parker Molloy, an editor at the progressive media-watchdog group Media Matters.\n\nAD\n\nHer specific concern? That Breitbart News is included in a list of trusted publishers despite being described by Steve Bannon, its former executive chairman, as \u201ca platform for the alt-right\u201d and often criticized as a font of disinformation.\n\nAsked at the Friday event why Breitbart was in the mix, Zuckerberg sounded a familiar note: Facebook News \u201cneeds to have a diversity of views\u201d and a \u201cbreadth of content.\u201d\n\nAnd he noted that a news organization\u2019s being \u201celigible to show up\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that its stories will be chosen.\n\nAD\n\nZuckerberg made his remarks at a \u201cfireside chat\u201d with the Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp. The Australian media executive gave his bosses \u2014 Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan \u2014 a shout-out during his opening remarks at the Paley Center for Media, where waiters circulated with canapes and attendees were offered water infused with cucumber, lavender and basil.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Thomson pointedly asked Zuckerberg, about the plan to pay news organizations, including the Wall Street Journal, which is part of News Corp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment,\u201d quipped the Facebook founder, who wore his trademark gray crew-neck sweater and dark jeans onstage.\n\nAD\n\nIt didn\u2019t really sound like a compliment, but then maybe that\u2019s a relative thing: It\u2019s been a contentious week or so for Zuckerberg, who is again under fire, including at a long congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nFacebook News will become available immediately to more than 200,000 people in the United States, with a broader rollout planned for early next year, The Post reported. Eventually, Zuckerberg said, he hopes it will be used by 20 to 30 million people \u2014 a modest slice of Facebook\u2019s 2 billion or so users.\n\nAD\n\nAs with all things Facebook does, this one ought to be viewed skeptically. The company\u2019s record on policing blatant disinformation and hate speech, particularly during the 2016 election, is beyond dismal.\n\nAD\n\nIt has an unfortunate tendency not to follow its own rules or standards.\n\nIn this case, one thing it has going for it is the deep involvement and journalistic credibility of a former Washington Post deputy national editor, Anne Kornblut.\n\nFor many years, Facebook \u2014 as a major worldwide disseminator of news, one that constantly makes editorial-style decisions \u2014 refused to cop to the obvious: That it is a media company, not just a platform.\n\nWith this development, that argument goes away. And because that may force a sense of responsibility about decision-making, it\u2019s a good thing.\n\nTo the extent that Facebook is putting at least some money and other resources behind high-quality journalism, that\u2019s a step forward.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it can\u2019t leave smaller, regional publishers in the lurch while placating the major influencers in the news business.\n\nIt can\u2019t promote and partner with purveyors of disinformation in the name of ideological diversity.\n\nAnd it can\u2019t just talk the game of \u201cWe\u2019re from Facebook and we\u2019re here to help.\u201d (Zuckerberg\u2019s Friday op-ed in the New York Times states as much, headlined: \u201cFacebook can help the news business.\u201d)\n\nLet\u2019s say, cautiously, that there\u2019s potential here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying for a long time that these big tech players could be an answer rather than the problem,\u201d Chavern of the News Media Alliance told me.\n\nWe\u2019ll see.\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan\n\nAD", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg unveils the curated Facebook News tab and claims it will help the news business.", "authors": ["Margaret Sullivan", "Media Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gbIxL7uewh60Xy6lsdMZfVLQRvE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Y3PFKIXXNEI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
