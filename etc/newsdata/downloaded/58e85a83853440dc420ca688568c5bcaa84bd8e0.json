Every year at the annual WellChild awards, he has taken time to meet each winner and listen to their stories. When his wife, Meghan Markle, gave birth to their first child, Archie, WellChild was one of the four charities the couple asked the public to donate to instead of sending gifts to the family.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harry struggled to fight back his tears and took a moment to regain his composure, as he told the crowd that since becoming a father, the stories of the award winners have touched him in a completely different way.\n\nWATCH: Harry is overcome by emotion during his speech at the @WellChild Awards. \u201cLast year when my wife and I attended we knew we were expecting our first child - no one else did at the time, but we did - and I remember squeezing Meghan\u2019s hand so tight during the awards... pic.twitter.com/tXRtxZRZ7k \u2014 Emily Nash (@emynash) October 15, 2019\n\n\"It has been over a decade since I first came to these awards and every year, they never fail to surprise and inspire me. Yet this year, it resonates in a different way, because now I'm a father. Last year, when my wife and I attended, we knew we were expecting our first child \u2014 no one else did at the time, but we did,\" Harry said, his voice breaking as he choked up with tears.\n\nAfter the host, Gaby Roslin, stepped in to pat him on the back and the crowd encouraged him on with applauds, he continued.\n\n\"I remember squeezing Meghan's hand so tight during the awards, both of us thinking what it would be like to be parents one day, and more so, what it would be like to do everything we could to protect and help our child should they be born with immediate challenges or become unwell over time,\" Prince Harry said. \"And now, as parents, being here and speaking to all of you, it pulls at my heartstrings in a way I could have never understood until I had a child of my own.\"\n\nThe poignant speech from the father of five-month-old Archie has touched many on social media.\n\nSo moving! I can't imagine what these parents go through! These guys are so strong to go through this and with such positive attitudes \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\u2764\u2764\u2764 \u2014 She Eva (@EvaEvansshine2) October 15, 2019\n\nI knew in retrospect it had to be very meeaningful for them both, given the special news they held close. He expressed it all so beautifully.\n\nThese families no doubt pull strength they didn't know they had. Love and committment. @WellChild great job. \u2014 zodiac1028 (@zodiac1028) October 15, 2019\n\nBless him. I know exactly what he means, having children changes your perspective so much and opens you up to such love and through that, fear. \u2014 Marie (@CariadMarie) October 15, 2019\n\nPowerful and touching words indeed. Every parent could relate to those feelings of unknown when you\u2019re respecting. \u2014 Chimchim (@Tigerlilyujarra) October 15, 2019\n\nMeghan, who attended the awards for the first time last year, met with this year's winners alongside her husband. Among them was 11-year-old Milly Sutherland, who was awarded \u201cMost Caring Young Person\u201d for caring for her late sister, Sophie, who had Aicardi syndrome. The royal couple joked with Milly and her mother, Angela, and at one point, Milly pulled a strand of her red hair, telling the Duke, \"Snap.\"\n\nAccording to Hello! magazine, Harry joked about his own thinning hair, asking, \"Can I borrow some?\"\n\nThe mother and daughter asked if Archie took after his father and would be growing some red locks of his own.\n\nHarry and Meghan also confirmed that Archie has red hair. Harry said you can \u2018see it in his eyebrows\u2019!\n\n(Many thanks @emynash who is keeping the home fires burning!) \u2014 Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cMeghan said he has and Harry said he definitely is \u2014 you can see it in his eyebrows,\u201d Angela said, according to People. \u201cHarry said he\u2019d had no hair for five months, but Meghan told him she had taken him to the playgroup and she said there were other children there with the same amount of hair or even less.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "On Tuesday at the WellChild awards, which honors children who are dealing with serious illnesses and their caretakers, Prince Harry fought back tears as he spoke about becoming a father.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fq.PwP09ZcvWwbuwa8hwsA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/video/video.thepressassociation.com/c12683b01ff5be5b6c42d4021da04d22", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
