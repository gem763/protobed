The U.S. Armed Forces will not support, or be involved in any such operation,\u201d chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn conversations between the department and the Turkish military we have consistently stressed that coordination and cooperation were the best path toward security in the area,\u201d Hoffman added.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperPentagon distances itself from Ukraine controversy North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Trump defense head says US has stepped up attacks on Taliban since talks broke down MORE and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley also \u201creiterated to their respective Turkish counterparts that unilateral action creates risks for Turkey,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nPentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Carla Gleason later said Turkey has been removed from the Air Tasking Order, which is what the U.S. military uses to organize and instruct air forces. As part of that, the United States is no longer sharing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance of the region with Turkey, she said.\n\nFollowing a phone call between President Trump Donald John TrumpWhite House says Turkey will soon launch Syria operation Trump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment MORE and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the White House announced late Sunday that NATO ally Turkey would proceed with a long-planned operation in northern Syria and said U.S. forces \u201cwill no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d\n\nThe retreat of U.S. forces, which have been acting as a buffer between Ankara and the Kurds, was widely seen as Trump giving his blessing for the Turkish operation to move forward.\n\nTurkey has long threatened to attack Kurdish forces in northern Syria. Ankara considers them terrorists connected with a Turkish Kurdish insurgency, but the United States considers them the most effective local force fighting ISIS in Syria.\n\nOn Monday, Trump reinforced his decision, tweeting that he \u201cwas elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to pull back from northern Syria was criticized across the political spectrum, including from several Republicans who are typically staunch allies. Critics say a U.S. retreat will abandon the Kurds to be slaughtered by Turkey and lead to chaos that will allow ISIS to regroup.\n\nAppearing to respond to the criticism, Trump issued a second series of tweets later Monday threatening to \u201cobliterate\u201d Ankara\u2019s economy if it does anything that, in his \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\u201d he \u201cconsider[s] to be off limits.\u201d\n\nThe tweets do not mention protection of the Kurds, but rather the need for Turkey and others to \u201cwatch over the captured ISIS fighters and families.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, the Pentagon also stressed that Turkey will be responsible for the thousands of ISIS fighters being detained in northern Syria.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which are led by the Kurds, are detaining an estimated 10,000 ISIS fighters; about 2,000 are estimated to be from countries other than Syria or Iraq.\n\n\u201cAs the president has stated, Turkey would be responsible, along with European nations and others, for thousands of ISIS fighters who had been captured and defeated in the campaign lead by the United States,\u201d Hoffman said.\n\nHoffman also said the Pentagon would continue to impress upon Turkey that an offensive would be destabilizing.\n\n\u201cWe will work with our other NATO allies and coalition partners to reiterate to Turkey the possible destabilizing consequences of potential actions to Turkey, the region, and beyond,\u201d he said.\n\nUpdated at 3:10 p.m.", "description": "The Pentagon insisted Monday that the United States is not endorsing an impending Turkish incursion into northern Syria, despite the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ussyria_040418getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
