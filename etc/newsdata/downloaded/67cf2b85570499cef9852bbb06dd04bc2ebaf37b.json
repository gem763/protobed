It ended with the voiceover of Jesse writing the letter to Brock and so, in the initial draft, the audience would\u2019ve heard what was in the letter.\u2019\n\nDespite Aaron\u2019s protests, the scene was cut, but the actor still has the letter to this day, and refuses to reveal its content.\n\n\u2018I wish I could tell you, it\u2019s such a beautiful letter, it\u2019s so well thought out,\u2019 he teased.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s actually the first thing that Vince wrote when he wrote the script, was that letter. The very first thing he wrote, he wrote a letter to Brock from Jesse, which is just\u2026 so beautiful.\u2019\n\nJesse left his old life behind in the final moments of El Camino (Picture: Netflix)\n\nJesse saves a life but ends up in jail\n\nWriter Vince Gilligan told Entertainment Weekly: \u201cI didn\u2019t get super far down the road, but it was probably going to be a young woman who needed some help.
