The shooting after the funeral left Mshairi Alkebular, 24, of Southeast Washington, dead.\n\nAlkebular, according to charging documents, was affiliated with the Barry Farm-Park Chester neighborhoods engaged in the rivalry, charging documents said.\n\nThe feud erupted in gunfire as members from both groups were leaving the funeral of Eric Byrd, who was killed in an unrelated shooting on U Street in Northwest Washington on July 20.\n\n[Grief for D.C. homicide victim is compounded by fatal shootout after his funeral]\n\n\n\nJulius Leach, 22, of Southeast Washington, has been charged with murder in connection with a fatal shooting that broke out Aug. 5 in Suitland, Md., at the funeral for a homicide victim. (Prince George\u2019s County police)\n\nAlthough the shooting after Byrd\u2019s funeral involved some of those who had attended services, it had nothing to do with Byrd, police have said. Byrd, according to police and family, had gotten along with diverse groups of people but those people didn\u2019t necessarily get along with one another.\n\nAs the funeral party departed the church, police said, a Charger began to follow the Corolla driven by Alkebular.\n\nThe Charger then pulled up to the Corolla in a townhouse community not far from the church when someone in the Charger fired at the Corolla, charging documents state. People in the Corolla returned fire, police said.\n\nLeach has been charged with murder, along with two other men police allege were in the Charger: Tavone Hoes, 26, and Gregory Sam, 25. Police say Hoes shot at the Corolla.\n\nSam, who was driving the Charger, is a documented member of \u201c10th Place Killas,\u201d which has also been feuding with groups out of Barry Farm and Park Chester, according to charging documents. Hoes is also a member of \u201c3rd World,\u201d like Leach, charging documents state.\n\nHoes is in custody in the District and is awaiting extradition to Prince George\u2019s County, according to police and online court records. Sam is being held in the Prince George\u2019s County detention center. A Prince George\u2019s County District Court judge ordered Sam held without bond during a bail review hearing Wednesday.\n\nAn attorney for Hoes did not respond to a request for comment and Sam\u2019s attorney said his client intends to plead not guilty. Online court records did not list an attorney for Leach.\n\nRead more:\n\nBalloons and bloodstains: Police still investigating shooting at toddler\u2019s birthday party that left seven wounded\n\nInnocent man spent months in jail for bringing honey back to United States\n\nFound insane in one killing, police say D.C. man killed again\n\nA child touched an electrified railing at MGM National Harbor resort, and lives changed\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The shooting sprang from a feud between rival groups in the District", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iQzIYXbqj1pyq0MDJhl0EL1oxrY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WFAFG5S7WMI6TPZE3NFZ7NRKUI.jpg"}
