Women have dressed up as the \"handmaids\" who are forced to bear children for Christian, fascist men in a dystopian future. Red cloaks and white bonnets have become signs of both totalitarian regimes and resistance. These shrouded figures were at Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, but are most often seen protesting attacks on abortion access laws. Many people, including Atwood, have stated that the dystopian melodrama conjures up real-life conflicts and is more documentary than fiction.\n\nRebecca Wanzo\n\nSome critics have decried \" Handmaid's Tale hysteria ,\" as we clearly do not live in Gilead. Women in the United States have not been deprived of employment, the right to read and self-governance, or subjected to state-mandated rape. But what we are subjected to is a world in which some people's vision for a better future is about fewer rights instead of more. Struggles over competing visions for the future produced Gilead, and that same struggle governs contemporary conflicts over how to survive very troubled times.\n\nDystopias are hot. I seem to encounter a new dystopian teen show from somewhere in the world every time I turn on Netflix. From \"The Hunger Games\" to \"The Walking Dead,\" many dystopias offer the basic genre pleasures of heroes and suspense. But while beautifully made, I don't think of the \"The Handmaid's Tale\" as deeply pleasurable -- a show about ritualized rape is often tortuous to watch.\n\nThe best dystopias also serve another function by addressing pressing political concerns, but not through realistic depictions of the world that are exactly like the one we live in now. George Orwell's Big Brother continues to resonate because \"1984\" is a cautionary tale about how nations can treat people, and why citizens submit to these regimes. Atwood's \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" its recent adaptation and her new sequel novel, \"The Testaments,\" serve a similar function. The extrapolations and parallels are compelling because the narratives are built from the real world. Allegory is not born of the impossible. It is born from recognition.\n\nJUST WATCHED 'Handmaids' protest Kavanaugh confirmation Replay More Videos ...

In \"The Testaments,\" the inhumane conditions that some women endure after the United States is overthrown bear no small relationship to the camps refugees and detained migrants inhabit in this country and elsewhere. The misogyny that unfolds on the page is evident beyond it as well. The fact that women receive a disproportionate amount of vitriol when they write online, inhabit predominately male spaces or speak out about sexual violence is well-documented, and politicians and scholars circulate the idea that women are not psychologically equipped for leadership and that their success is destroying white manhood. That there are men who feel they have a right to hurt and punish women who will not have sex with them is not hysteria. That's real life.\n\nRead More", "description": "Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and its TV adaptation veer too close to reality for many.
