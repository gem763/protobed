The 12-nation Lima Group and most Western nations have recognised Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the nation\u2019s legitimate interim president.\n\n\u201cWe believe serious and credible steps for accountability are needed. And these steps cannot be found inside Venezuela,\u201d said Brazil\u2019s ambassador Maria Nazareth Farani Azevedo.\n\nThe resolution condemned \u201cwidespread targeted repression and persecution\u201d through what it called the excessive use of force against peaceful protesters, the closing down of media and the erosion of the rule of law.\n\nU.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, in a report issued on July 4 after her visit to the Andean country, said that Venezuelan security forces were sending death squads to murder young men staging the scenes to make it look like the victims resisted arrest.\n\nGovernment figures showed that deaths ascribed to criminals resisting arrest numbered 5,287 last year and 1,569 by May 19 this year. The U.N. report said the figures were \u201cshockingly high\u201d and many of them appeared to be extrajudicial executions.\n\nThe government of President Nicolas Maduro has called the U.N. report a \u201cselective and openly partial vision\u201d about the situation.\n\nThe resolution expressed \u201cgrave concern at the fact that there have been at least 6,000 killings resulting from security operations in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela since January 2018 and that, according to information analysed by the High Commissioner, many of these killings may constitute extrajudicial executions\u201d.\n\nIt condemned arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances carried out by security forces, such as the Fuerzas de Acciones Especiales (Special Action Forces) known as FAES, and pro-government civilian armed groups.\n\nAt least 3.7 million Venezuelans are \u201cmalnourished\u201d amid shortages of food, vaccines and access to health care, the resolution said.\n\n\u201cThe action by the Human Rights Council sends a clear message to the Venezuelan authorities that they will eventually be held accountable for their crimes,\u201d Jose Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights Watch said in a statement.", "description": "The United Nations Human Rights Council agreed on Friday to set up an international fact-finding mission to document violations in Venezuela, including torture and thousands of summary executions.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
