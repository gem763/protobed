It was as much inculcation as education: Sanitary product manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark hoped the booklets would create loyal consumers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe writer of this book believes that a menstruating woman, otherwise healthy, is not a sick woman,\u201d intones the author of a Kotex booklet from 1928.\n\nAD\n\nNonetheless, old menstruation manuals reflect plenty of stereotypes. Girls are admonished to remain \u201cdainty\u201d and try not to offend others during their periods. Some booklets warn readers to hold back on strenuous exercise; others use menstruation as a reason to remind girls that it\u2019s their duty to plan for marriage and childbirth.\n\nOver the years, descriptions of \u201cwombs\u201d and \u201ccanals\u201d gave way to scientific terms such as uterus and vagina. Recommendations to douche in the name of cleanliness were replaced with warnings about the dangers of douching, which is now widely discouraged.\n\nAD\n\nThe pamphlets also reveal a plethora of defunct menstrual products, from lubricated tampons that are no longer on the market to early disposable pads that involved pins, scissors and multiple toilet flushes.\n\nMenstruation was characterized as a shameful secret then. By the early 1980s, the influence of the feminist movement can be felt in a Tampax booklet that declares: \u201cYou are a woman. . . . Acceptance of menstruation is important to your perception of yourself and your femaleness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe now-defunct Museum of Menstruation has a collection of the booklets on its still-active website at MUM.org/compbook.htm You might even find the one you were given in elementary school.\n\nA period comes to an end: 100 years of menstruation products\n\nGynecology museum\u2019s 4,500 items tell an interesting and odd tale\n\nAmerican cheese, sidewalks and chairs have a connection that may surprise you\n\nAD", "description": "The now-defunct Museum of Menstruation offers a collection of these publications on its still-active website.", "authors": ["Erin Blakemore"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RbiLklbZe3v47YlmetLf048isMo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GU6HZOXAUQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
