Two years ago Ashley fought off a \u00a315 million demand from a former adviser who said he had been promised the money during a 'night of heavy drinking'.\n\nBut his combative business style has reached new heights this year. He funded legal action that a court heard was intended to drive Debenhams 'out of business'.\n\nHe also stunned markets by revealing a \u00a3605million Belgian tax bill during summer and, only last week, lambasted bosses at Goals Soccer Centres for 'skulduggery' after rejecting his overtures.\n\nDocuments filed in New York courts and obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal that, during the process of buying Eastern Outfitters in 2017, one of Ashley's associates met with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani who then held a senior position at Sports Direct adviser and law firm Greenberg Traurig.\n\n'I'll only come if I can meet Trump' Mike Ashley snubbed the chance to meet former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, telling an associate he would only attend if he could also meet US President Donald Trump, a court has heard. The billionaire was offered the chance to meet Trump adviser Giuliani in 2017. Ashley associate Howard Moher told a New York court hearing: 'I do remember Mike Ashley was not interested in meeting Rudy Giuliani unless it involved meeting President Trump.' Moher said he personally was 'neutral' about the prospect, adding: 'I only went out of politeness because we'd set up a meeting in expectation of meeting Mike Ashley. Somebody had to show up.'\n\nAshley allegedly turned down the opportunity 'unless it involved also meeting President Trump'.\n\nThe acquisition of Eastern Outfitters, which owns Bob's Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports, was Sports Direct's first major US retail acquisition, the court heard. It included the $17million purchase of debt from the group's former owner Versa Capital which now claims Sports Direct owes it an extra $7.2million.\n\nSports Direct has dismissed the claim and resisted calls for Ashley to give evidence. Sports Direct said Ashley is often not involved with deals until a late stage, leaving associates to do the leg work.\n\nIn one document his lawyer argued he 'did not exchange or generate any emails, text messages, or other documents electronic or otherwise regarding the transaction' and so has no documents 'in his possession' that would be relevant to the trial.\n\nAshley's business associate Howard Moher has already taken the stand. Sports Direct lawyers argued that Justin Barnes, a Sports Direct consultant, should give evidence in Ashley's place.\n\nBut New York judge Andrew Borrok ruled: 'Mr Ashley has information that is material and necessary to its claims in this action.'\n\nThe judge said claimant Vestis, a subsidiary of private equity firm Versa Capital, wants to question Ashley on 'a specific conversation' in which they say he agreed to include 'an additional consideration' as well as paying $17 million to buy the debt.\n\nMike Ashley allegedly turned down the opportunity to meet former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani 'unless it involved also meeting President Trump'\n\nMoher told a New York court in July that Barnes is 'the right hand man of Mike Ashley' who acts 'as the gatekeeper on transactions for Mike Ashley' even though Barnes does not have a specific job title at Sports Direct.\n\nHe said during the negotiations Moher initially spoke with Barnes and then with Ashley, who suggested offering $17million for the debt. Ashley told Moher 'don't move' despite pressure from the sellers to do so increase the offer to $20million.\n\nSports Direct rejects the $7.2million claim. Sports Direct and Vestis last night declined to comment.
