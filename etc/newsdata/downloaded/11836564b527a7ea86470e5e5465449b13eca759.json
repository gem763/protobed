Many have received pre-settled status,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday.\n\nHe said many Polish people did not realise they had to register as they have lived here for many years. \u201cEven if they have resident status, they still have to register,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are quite a lot of problems with people trying to receive settled status. People who have been here five or 10 years have also had problems.\u201d\n\nThe Polish ambassador earlier wrote to Poles encouraging them to \u201cseriously consider the possibility of returning to their homeland\u201d post-Brexit. Rzegocki, who has represented Warsaw in the UK since 2016, said Poland \u201cregrets\u201d Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc, scheduled for 31 October.\n\nOffice for National Statistics data shows about 832,000 people born in Poland were resident in the UK in 2018. Rzegocki wrote that only 27% of Poles living in the UK had submitted an application for settled status, saying this was an \u201calarmingly low level\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cI also encourage you to seriously consider the possibility of returning to your homeland. The rapidly growing economy of our country creates more and more opportunities for citizens for development and good living conditions in the country.\n\n\u201cSoon, Great Britain, which has been home to thousands of Poles for generations, will most likely cease to be a member of the European Union \u2013 which we regret, but we also see this process as an opportunity to strengthen the bond between our two countries.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, speaking on the Today programme, Rzegocki said: \u201cPoland and the Polish economy is growing, life standards are improving \u2013 they are much different compared with five to 10 years ago. I think it is a very good opportunity to come back to Poland. I think you can achieve your goals in both Britain and Poland.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said that while there was still time to apply to the settled status scheme, he expected those who wanted to would have already done so, adding: \u201cOn one hand there is still a lot of time to apply, on the other hand because of Brexit it is better to achieve settled status soon.\u201d\n\nWhen questioned on how many Poles may choose to return home, Rzegocki said: \u201cIt is difficult to predict. Last year, 116,000 left the country. There are still about a million here but you can see there is a discussion being had. We are doing the best to keep our relationship as close as possible as there is a long friendship between our countries.\u201d", "description": "Arkady Rzegocki voices concerns over settled status application process", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72b8672bf57d2310fd761ffbb8f388fa6562e0a3/305_450_4845_2907/master/4845.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb4edf3a1320e5a98853112453af0b4e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
