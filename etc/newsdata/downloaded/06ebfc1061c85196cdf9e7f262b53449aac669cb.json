They come from all over the country\u2014including Wisconsin (James Sensenbrenner), Georgia (Rob Woodall), and Utah (Rob Bishop). The list is getting so long we\u2019ve spun up a full retirement tracker to keep tabs on it.\n\nLosses to the party\u2019s already dwindling flock of women and people of color may sting the most. Two of the 13 GOP women in the House are heading for the exit, meaning that, in the House, there are more men named Jim than Republican women running for re-election.\n\nBut perhaps the most stunning retirement of them all has been Representative Will Hurd of Texas, the lone Black Republican in the House who, before the MAGA-fication of the GOP, was heralded as the future of the party. If Hurd is no longer the GOP\u2019s future, who exactly is?\n\n\u2014Saahil Desai\n\nRevisiting the UN\n\n(Eduardo Munoz / Reuters)\n\nThe gathering of the world\u2019s nations is used to being overshadowed by domestic U.S. politics at this point. The activist Greta Thunberg sailed across the sea for two weeks to speak on climate change. The British effort to leave the European Union stagnates as the deadline ticks closer. Other countries were trying to salvage an Iran deal. But at the UN, crises are relative, Kathy Gilsinan writes.\n\nRemember Venezuela? The humanitarian crisis unfolding in South America received light coverage during UNGA week. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro remains in power nine months after the U.S. and more than 50 other countries recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the country\u2019s legitimate leader.\n\nOn Impeachment\n\n(Leah Millis / Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump seems to have no real impeachment war room. Bill Clinton focused on his day job during the Lewinsky scandal and subsequent impeachment, but Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter screeds show the exact opposite approach, David Frum writes.\n\nImpeachment processes are also about the role of Congress in American governing. \u201cAfter all, congressional oversight is a critical component of the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances,\u201d Brianne Gorod argues, \u201cand if the courts accept the president\u2019s arguments, they would strip Congress of one of the fundamental tools it uses to serve as an effective check on the executive branch.\u201d\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\n\u2023 Monday, Sept. 30: House committees subpoenaed Rudy Giuliani over Ukraine-related documents. He recently spoke to\u2014er, yelled at\u2014our White House reporter.\n\n\u2023 Tuesday, Oct. 1: Squeaking by the DNC\u2019s deadline\u2014and stricter criteria\u2014to qualify for this month\u2019s Democratic debates are Tom Steyer and Tulsi Gabbard. The total field is still improbably large.\n\n\u2023 Wednesday, Oct. 2: President Trump hosts the president of Finland at the White House.\n\n\u2023 Thursday, Oct. 3: The House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs Committees conduct a deposition with the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, who resigned last week after a \u2026 busy week for Ukraine and all involved in a July 25 phone call.", "description": "Why so many Republicans are retiring from Congress.
