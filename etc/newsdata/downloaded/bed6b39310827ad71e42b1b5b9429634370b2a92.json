In the same way that \u201cno collusion, no obstruction\u201d went hand in hand with the Mueller report, Democrats have managed to turn \u201cquid pro quo\u201d into the tagline for the current impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s perhaps the first time since Trump entered office that Democrats have managed to wrangle the first word on a presidential scandal\u2014which puts them in a better position than ever to have the final word, too.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big problem for all of us in trying to push back\u201d against impeachment: the lack of a clear message from the White House, one Senate Republican aide told us, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to be candid. \u201cWe don\u2019t have those answers. We don\u2019t work in the State Department, White House, or National Security Council. There\u2019s no way we can answer those questions without [White House officials] sending out information that helps our cause. And they\u2019re just incapable of doing that.\u201d\n\nCaught in unfamiliar terrain, the White House appears to be lost in this pivotal moment. And Republicans, bereft of guidance, have found themselves either mangling their attempts to defend the president or, as a growing number appear to be, unwilling to even try.", "description": "", "authors": ["Plott", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Trump-Impeachment-Quid-Pro-Quo"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
