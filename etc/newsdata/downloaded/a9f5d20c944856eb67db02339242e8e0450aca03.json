President Trump is leading this country on a game-winning drive despite the ear-splitting roar coming from the Democrats and liberal media personalities sitting in the cheap seats.\n\nAs a lifelong businessman whose first foray into politics was winning the presidency in 2016, Donald Trump is kind of like the old-school barnstormers who were always the \u201caway\u201d team, contending with opponents (the Democrats) playing on familiar turf (the D.C. swamp) with the backing of a supportive local crowd (the mainstream media). It\u2019s easy to forget, considering how effective this president has been, that the people he\u2019s had to spar with over the past three years have spent literally their whole adult lives training to compete on the political gridiron.\n\nThe Democrats have been playing \u201cprevent\u201d defense for most of Trump\u2019s presidency, employing an obstructionist strategy designed to keep him from making big plays. After watching the president march down the field for nearly three years, the Democrats\u2019 defensive coordinator, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is dialing up a more aggressive play \u2014 the Democrats are showing blitz, and their fans are screaming with anticipation, acutely aware that this is virtually guaranteed to be the last drive of the game.\n\nLike any good quarterback, though, President Trump has ice water flowing through his veins. The pressure isn\u2019t distracting him at all as he focuses on doing the job at hand.\n\nInstead of calling an audible in the face of the Democrats\u2019 pressure, Donald Trump is trusting that his offensive line \u2014 trusted advisors, campaign spokespeople, and even some congressional Republicans \u2014 will pick up the blitz.\n\nEven in the midst of an \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d President Trump has kept his sights firmly set on the ultimate goal of making America stronger, safer, and more prosperous than ever before.\n\nHe didn\u2019t let the impeachment circus stop him from calling attention to a recent wave of business investment in the U.S., for instance, using it as an opportunity to once again tout the strong and growing American economy.\n\n\u201cBIG NEWS by @Hyundai, @Kia, and @Aptiv on a 4 BILLION DOLLAR joint venture to develop autonomous driving technologies in the USA,\u201d the President tweeted on Monday afternoon. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of $$ and JOBS! Great jobs coming back to America!!\u201d\n\nThe President also congratulated Apple for deciding to build its new Mac Pro in Texas, which will support hundreds of jobs in Austin. Notably, Apple announced the move just days after the Trump administration gave the tech giant an exemption to import certain components from China free of tariffs \u2014 a clear sign that President Trump remains focused on negotiating deals that benefit American workers.\n\nThat\u2019s not all, though. President Trump also recently signed a bill extending various benefits for veterans, including home loans, homelessness assistance, and beneficiary travel. On the same day, he signed the \u201cAutism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education, and Support Act of 2019,\u201d which reinforces numerous existing autism initiatives in the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration is even making significant progress on border security despite the ongoing obstructionism of congressional Democrats. In fact, the federal government just awarded three new contracts to a pair of construction companies to erect approximately 65 miles of new barriers along the Texas-Mexico border, a significant portion of the 450 miles of border wall slated for completion by the end of 2020.\n\nIt might be difficult to believe, given the media fixation on impeachment, but all of those policy accomplishments happened in just a single day \u2014 and that was after the impeachment inquiry had just dominated the weekend news cycle.\n\nThe clock is winding down, the Democrats are blitzing, and the media are creating a cacophony in the bleachers. Yet, somehow, President Trump isn\u2019t rattled; he just keeps finding the open man and moving the ball downfield.\n\nLou Holtz was the head football coach at the University of Notre Dame 1986 to 1996.
