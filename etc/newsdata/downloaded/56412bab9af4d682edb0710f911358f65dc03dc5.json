Thousands of exoplanets have been detected, including an Earth-sized world orbiting the closest star to the Sun. But it is still extremely difficult to capture details about the interior composition and dynamics of these worlds. Unlike other planetary properties such as mass or atmospheric composition, a planet\u2019s geochemistry cannot be deduced just by looking at an object passing in front of its host star.\n\nWhite dwarfs, as it turns out, can help plug this information gap. These objects are the remains of stars that have blown up and collapsed into tiny, dense spheres about the size of Earth (our own Sun will embark on this transition in about five billion years).\n\nThe pyrotechnic deaths of these stars scramble the orbits of many objects in our solar system, such as asteroids and planets. Some of these worlds may end up hurtling toward the star\u2019s posthumous white dwarf, which tears them apart over the course of about 100,000 to one million years.\n\n\u201cWhenever a body comes really close to it, a white dwarf will completely shred it and that dust and debris will fall and accrete onto the star,\u201d Doyle explained. \u201cWhite dwarfs are really the only way that you can measure the rocks directly because we know that when we\u2019re observing them, the elements that we\u2019re seeing\u2014iron, silicon, magnesium\u2014are directly from the rock itself.\u201d\n\nDoyle\u2019s team observed six of these \u201cpolluted\u201d white dwarfs located between 200 and 665 light years from Earth. The researchers were particularly interested in quantifying the iron content of rocks smashed up by the white dwarfs. Iron is a key indicator of \u201coxygen fugacity,\u201d which is a measurement of the past oxidation levels of a planetary body.\n\n\u201cThe more oxygen you have around when you make the rocks, the more iron ends up in the rocks, as opposed to in metal,\u201d said Young. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re measuring in the white dwarfs\u2014the amount of iron that was in the rock when it hit the white dwarf.\u201d\n\nIt is still not known why planets in our solar system seem to have been enriched with so much oxygen, which has made it difficult to make assumptions about the oxygen content of alien systems. But it is clear that oxidation deeply influences whether a world will develop a magnetic field, plate tectonics, and other processes that are crucial to life here on Earth.\n\n\u201cOxygen fugacity is as important as pressure and temperature constraints for determining which minerals will be dominant in the interior of a planet,\u201d said Doyle. \u201dSo, this can have huge implications for parameters that are important for habitability.\u201d\n\nThe researchers discovered that the same chemical compounds found in Earth, Mars, and asteroids in our solar system\u2014including iron\u2014are also abundant in the objects that crashed into these six white dwarf systems. \u201cRocks are rocks everywhere, we think,\u201d Young said.\n\nIn other words, bodies that are similar to Earth and Mars appear to be common throughout the Milky Way, which boosts the odds that extraterrestrial life may have evolved elsewhere in the galaxy.\n\nDoyle and her colleagues plan to keep observing polluted white dwarfs to build an even more robust model of the contents of exoplanets.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of doing the kind of chemistry on planets that we do inside this solar system outside the solar system, I wouldn\u2019t have thought would be possible,\u201d said Young.\n\n\u201cBut it is possible,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re actually doing true geochemistry on rocks from several planetary systems. To me, that\u2019s really exciting because now everything we\u2019ve learned about the solar system has relevance beyond the solar system.\u201d", "description": "After studying the remains of exoplanets that crashed into dead stars, scientists think that rocky planets similar to Earth and Mars are likely common outside of our solar system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da89ce2c0ec78000ab665af/lede/1571331491738-dsrsdgdsfgsdfgdsfg.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7491xh;0xw,0.0407xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
