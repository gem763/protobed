The July 25 call is now the focus of a U.S. impeachment probe.\n\nAsked if Moscow is worried that the White House could similarly publish transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that \u201cwe would like to hope that it wouldn\u2019t come to that in our relations, which are already troubled by a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in a conference call with reporters, he emphasized that the publication of the Trump-Zelenskiy call is an internal U.S. issue, but added that it was \u201cquite unusual\u201d to release a confidential call between leaders.\n\n\u201cThe materials related to conversations between heads of states are usually classified according to normal international practice,\u201d he said.\n\nThe publication of the call, in which the presidents made critical comments about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, has drawn acerbic comments from other Russian officials and lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for the party to continue,\u201d said Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. \u201cLet them publish transcripts of conversations between NATO allies. It would also be useful to publish minutes of closed meetings at the CIA, the FBI and the Pentagon. Put it all on air!\u201d\n\nZakharova also scoffed at Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to open an impeachment inquiry based on the call.\n\n\u201cIs it the Democrats\u2019 job to make a laughing stock of the United States?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what Ms. Pelosi has done to Congress, the White House and other state institutions.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Putin and his officials similarly derided U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Kremlin interference in the 2016 presidential election, casting it as a failure and shrugging off Mueller\u2019s exposure of evidence of Russian meddling in the vote.\n\nMueller found that there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, but he charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with breaking into Democratic Party computers and the email accounts of officials with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Russia voiced hope Friday that the U.S. administration wouldn't publish private conversations between the two nations' presidents, like it did with Ukraine.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vladimir Isachenkov"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/Russia_China_80585.jpg-89ace_c0-0-4300-2507_s1770x1032.jpg?9979e3732a8b53d5a9ac4cb15792ba4bc055e10d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
