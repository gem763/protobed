After years of poor governance, the Iraqi people have run out of patience with the failures of their governing elites to deliver basic services or to reduce unemployment and corruption. Tens of thousands have come out in protests in Baghdad and parts of southern Iraq since last week. More than 100 protesters have been killed and thousands have been injured by security forces. Broadcasting stations have been attacked and social media platforms and the internet have been blocked.\n\nThe scale and magnitude of the protests is unprecedented , as is the violent reaction from the Iraqi government. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has failed to prevent Iraq\u2019s worst crisis since the Islamic State seized Mosul in 2014. He must take responsibility and ensure that the officials responsible for the large scale killings of protesters are prosecuted.\n\nThe crisis places Mr. Abdul Mahdi in a precarious position. Protesters want jobs and services, accountability and, in some cases, a complete overhaul of the Iraqi political class. The prime minister has failed to offer concessions \u2014 an increase in salaries, a basic wage for poorer families and interest-free housing credit programs \u2014 that could placate them. In a televised address, Mr. Abdul Mahdi expressed willingness to respond to the \u201crightful demands\u201d of the protesters but warned that there was no \u201cmagic solution\u201d to Iraq\u2019s problems.\n\nMr. Abdul Mahdi, an independent politician who has been the finance minister and vice president, deserves a chance to pull Iraq out of this crisis and move forward. He is a veteran Shiite politician known for his conciliatory tone and personality, who shuns the dogmatism and authoritarianism of his predecessors.", "description": "The prime minister has improved relations with the Sunni minority and the Kurds. But he can\u2019t meet the demands of the protesters without fixing the economy.", "authors": ["Ranj Alaaldin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/opinion/08alaSub/merlin_162262551_37d7a6ae-11e6-41c9-81eb-3904036d5fec-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
