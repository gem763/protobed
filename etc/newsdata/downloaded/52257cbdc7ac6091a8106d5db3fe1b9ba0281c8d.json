The ISIS leader was imprisoned by American forces in Iraq in 2004, during the administration of George W. Bush, but was seen as an insignificant figure at the time. He was released after less than a year and then dropped out of view for several years. United States officials did not appreciate his import as an insurgent leader until 2009, early in the administration of President Barack Obama.\n\nMr. al-Baghdadi became a top target of American forces deployed by Mr. Obama to Iraq and Syria after he led ISIS\u2019s seizure of large swaths of territory in those countries in 2014. And United States officials say that Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal of American troops from northeastern Syria earlier this month had complicated planning already underway for the treacherous raid on Mr. al-Baghdadi.", "description": "In a freewheeling speech to police chiefs, President Trump also railed against impeachment, Jussie Smollett and Chicago\u2019s violence.", "authors": ["Michael Crowley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/us/politics/28dc-trump/28dc-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
