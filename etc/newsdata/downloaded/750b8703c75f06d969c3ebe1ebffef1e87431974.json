Maybe, as has happened so often over the course of his charmed life, he will soar while all around him plummet, and they instead of he will suffer for his sins. His campaign associates go to jail; he goes to the Group of 7. The most principled Republicans are driven from the fold; he reigns without principle over a party that has largely bent to his wishes rather than stand up for what it purported to believe.\n\n\u201cMost often I\u2019m asked why so many Republicans aren\u2019t running for re-election,\u201d Dave Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, told me. \u201cBut I ask why so many are. This isn\u2019t the cruise they signed up for.\u201d He noted that up until a few months before Trump effectively secured the Republican nomination in 2016, not a single Republican in Congress had endorsed him. The first two House members who took that icy plunge \u2014 Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California \u2014 are now under criminal indictment (though not for anything having to do with Trump).\n\nBoth before the midterms and now, Republicans are leaving Congress for all sorts of reasons. But they outnumber Democrats on the way out because, generally speaking, they assume that Republicans will remain in the House minority and they\u2019re exhausted by the tandem experiences of powerlessness and answering for Trump\u2019s chaos and cruelties.", "description": "", "authors": ["Frank Bruni", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday"], "top_image": ""}
