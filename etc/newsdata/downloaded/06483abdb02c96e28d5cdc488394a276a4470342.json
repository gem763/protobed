And nor should Australian prime ministers,\" Mr Morrison said during the question-and-answer session after his speech.\n\nAllan Gyngell, former head of the government's intelligence analysis agency the Office of National Assessments, described Mr Morrison's speech as having an \"anxious and inward-looking tone\".\n\nIt was a \"clear step away from the sort of Australian foreign policy articulated in the government\u2019s 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper and towards the worldview of Trumpism and Brexit,\" he said.\n\n\"What is striking here are the adjectives\" used to describe and rank Australia's international partners, Mr Gyngell said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia was \u201ca natural partner\u201d, Japan provided \u201csteadfast friendship and support\u201d, and the US was \"our past, our present and our future\" and \"the bedrock of our security\", Mr Morrison said, on the heels of a week-long American trip.\n\nMr Morrison described China as a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partner\" and noted its economic achievements before backing US President Donald Trump's calls for China to be stripped of its developing nation status, which entitles it to concessions under World Trade Organisation rules.\n\n\"It\u2019s a balder, less optimistic tone than that of Morrison\u2019s own Asialink speech a few weeks ago,\" Mr Gyngell said.\n\nDescribing India so favourably while confining Australia-China relations to economic terms sends a clear message to China, said Clinton Fernandes, Professor of International Relations at the University of NSW.\n\n\"This speech shows the government is trying to firm up the relationship with India as a hedge against China,\" he said.\n\n\"When you compare the language used to describe India, the PM's comments send a clear message that the government wants a confined, instrumental, economic relationship with China,\" Mr Fernandes said.", "description": "Analysts say the prime minister's warm tone when speaking about India is carefully calculated to send a message to Beijing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3166%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_150%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ee41ba0c257c153a18d5e4907f2219d79405a8b6", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
