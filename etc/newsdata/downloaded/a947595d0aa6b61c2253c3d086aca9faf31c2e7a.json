Bush twice sought and obtained congressional authorization to use force, once against al-Qaeda, then against Iraq. President George H. W. Bush sought and got congressional authorization to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Where\u2019s Trump\u2019s authorization to attack Iran? An attack on Iran would not be a police action in a failed state, such as the U.S. intervention in Somalia in the early 1990s; it would not be low-risk in terms of American lives and money, such as President Bill Clinton\u2019s operations in the former Yugoslavia in the mid-1990s. An attack on Iran in defense of Saudi Arabia could\u2014and very likely would\u2014rapidly escalate into a big war across a range of battlefields, including cyber, all over the world. Starting such a war obviously exceeds any historic or reasonable definition of inherent presidential power. Congress must be asked for its authorization.\n\nWhat\u2019s the national interest?\n\nArmed aggression against U.S. friends and partners does not in itself demand a U.S. response. India has been a target of frequent armed aggression from Pakistan. The United States has not jumped in. Normally, the United States asks questions such as: Can this friend handle the attack on its own? Is there perhaps fault on both sides? Are there nonmilitary solutions? How important are the interests at risk?\n\nThat last question is especially important in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs Trump often reminds his Twitter readers, the United States is again a net exporter of oil, and the world\u2019s largest single producer of petroleum. Saudi Arabia\u2019s top customer is now China. The attack on the Saudi refineries raised the price of oil, but it\u2019s doubtful that the spike will endure\u2014and anyway, it is not obvious that an ultralow oil price is in the U.S. national interest. A higher oil price improves the competitiveness of North American producers and encourages oil consumers around the world to burn less of the climate-altering stuff.\n\nThere\u2019s no evident emergency here.\n\nDavid Frum: Speak up, John Bolton\n\nWhat are the goals?\n\nIf the point of \u201clocking and loading\u201d is to impose a cost on Iran for its misconduct\u2014well, Tehran is already paying for its misdeeds, in the form of crushing U.S. sanctions. Trump has often said that his supreme goal with Iran is to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear missile. If that\u2019s the goal, then we need a new diplomatic initiative to replace the U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement that Trump canceled.\n\nIf Trump hits Iran at the same time he is so abjectly wooing North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, it would, by contrast, only drive home the message: You people are fools not to develop a bomb of your own.\n\nWho\u2019s in charge?\n\nTrump is working, at most, part-time. He is neither respected nor trusted by some 60 percent of the U.S. population, one of the most consistent rejections of a president in modern American political history. His administration is a chaos of rapid staff turnover, mutual betrayal, and weirdos and incompetents at the highest level. When good people occupy senior positions, they candidly ignore the president\u2014as in the famous story of Secretary of Defense James Mattis taking a call from an agitated Trump, listening to his orders, then hanging up the phone and telling staff: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do any of that.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s threats of retaliation for strikes on Saudi oil facilities seem premature.", "authors": ["David Frum", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2PUAJ/facebook.jpg?1568644910", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
