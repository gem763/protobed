Google is expected to rake in more than $48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue this year, far rivaling its peers, while capturing 75 percent of all spending on U.S. search ads, according to eMarketer.\n\n\u201cThey dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and the video side with YouTube,\u201d he said during a news conference alongside officials from 11 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nSome of those attorneys general appeared to raise additional complaints about Google, ranging from the way the company processes and ranks search results to the extent to which it may not fully protect users\u2019 personal information. Their early rebukes raised the stakes for Google, threatening top-to-bottom scrutiny of its sprawling business beyond just ads. Paxton promised the probe would go wherever the facts lead.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being a dominant player when it\u2019s done fairly,\u201d said Sean Reyes, the Republican attorney general of Utah. He said there is a \u201cpresumption\u201d of innocence in such an investigation but still said there is a \u201cpervasiveness\u201d to complaints about Google\u2019s business practices.\n\nJeff Landry, a Republican from Louisiana, added: \u201cWe\u2019re here because there\u2019s an absolutely existential threat to our virtual marketplace.\u201d\n\nGoogle declined to comment, pointing to its previous statements saying it will work with state officials.\n\nThe probe marks the latest regulatory headache for Google and the rest of Silicon Valley, which have faced growing criticism \u2014 and widening state and federal scrutiny \u2014 into whether they\u2019ve grown too big and powerful, undermining rivals and resulting in costlier or worse service for web users. The Post first reported the states\u2019 plans for a Google probe last week.\n\nFor Google, though, the states\u2019 investigation comes more than six years after federal watchdogs wrapped up an antitrust investigation into its search and advertising practices and opted against bringing major penalties against the company, including breaking it up. Regulators around the world, meanwhile, have been more skeptical of Google: The European Union has issued the company $9 billion in competition-related fines over the past three years.\n\n[Facebook, Google face off against a formidable new foe: State attorneys general]\n\nThe states\u2019 investigation is led by Texas\u2019 Paxton and seven other attorneys general, four Democrats and four Republicans in total. Every state except Alabama and California, the home of Silicon Valley, so far has signed onto the bipartisan effort, as have Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman for California\u2019s attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlready, state officials have sent official legal demands for documents to the tech giant related to the investigation of online ads, Paxton told reporters.\n\nAshley Moody, the Republican attorney general of Florida, said the states\u2019 Google probe starts with the company\u2019s vast data stores. \u201cGoogle monitors our online behavior, and captures data on every one of us as we navigate the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cThis investigation will initially focus on capture of that information and whether Google embedded itself on every level of the online market [for] ad sales to monopolize this industry.\u201d\n\nLeslie Rutledge, a Republican attorney general from Arkansas, described Google as an \u201conline search engine juggernaut,\" raising her concern that searches for businesses, including doctors, are colored by the way the tech giant\u2019s algorithms and advertising systems work.\n\n\u201cI want the best advice, from the best doctors \u2014 not the doctor, not the clinic who can spend the most on advertising,\u201d she said.\n\nThe states\u2019 investigation arrives as the Department of Justice and FTC also are scrutinizing Big Tech, and DOJ has taken early interest in Google. The agency issued its first legal demand for records at the end of August, according to a securities filing Google made Friday.\n\nAnother group of 11 state attorneys general \u2014 led by New York\u2019s Letitia James \u2014 has begun their own probe against Facebook, exploring whether it violates competition laws and mishandles consumers\u2019 personal information.\n\nSome state leaders said they are working closely with their federal counterparts as these investigations unfold. But Karl Racine, the Democratic attorney general for D.C. and a participant in both the Facebook and Google probes, said he and his peers wouldn\u2019t hesitate to forge ahead if Washington once again opts against taking action against the tech giants.\n\n\u201cThe state attorneys general, they are an independent bunch, and they can be quite tenacious,\u201d he said . \u201cSo I\u2019m very confident that this bipartisan group is going to be led by the facts, and not be swayed by any conclusion, that may fall short, if you will, if it\u2019s inconsistent with our facts, on the [federal] side.\"", "description": "More than 40 state attorneys general on Monday officially announced an antitrust investigation of Google.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "September At Pm", "Tony Romm Is A Technology Policy Reporter At The Washington Post.
