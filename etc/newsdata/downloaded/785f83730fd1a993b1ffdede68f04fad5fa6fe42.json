Judging by the kind of looks he kept shooting them, Diana and Richard Gere's newly blossoming friendship was not going down well with Sylvester Stallone at all.\"\n\nApparently Sly attended the dinner party with the sole purpose of meeting and romancing Diana.\n\nWhen dinner was announced Elton says everyone rushed to the table, apart from Richard and Sly.\n\nHe writes: \"It transpired that David discovered Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere in the corridor, squaring up to each other, apparently about to settle their differences over Diana by having a fist-fight.\n\n\"He'd managed to calm things down by pretending he hadn't noticed what was going on \u2014 'Hey, guys! Time for dinner!' \u2014 but Sylvester clearly still wasn't happy.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nHe adds: \"I never would have come,' he snapped, as David and I showed him to the door, 'if I'd known Prince f***in' Charming was gonna be here.' Then he added: 'If I'd wanted her, I would've taken her!\"\n\nDiana was apparently none the wiser and went back to the fireplace with her first choice, Richard Gere.\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15.", "description": "In Elton John's new candid autobiography he details the evening Princess Diana sparked an almighty row with Hollywood royalty", "authors": ["Lucy Buckland", "Image", "Reuters", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13922382.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Elton-John-in-Milan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
