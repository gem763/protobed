(Photo: REUTERS/Carlo Allegri)\n\nWhether onscreen or off, Robert De Niro\u2019s never been one to mince words. Now, his straight talk has turned the air blue at CNN.\n\nDe Niro, currently starring in the new Martin Scorsese film The Irishman, appeared on CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources on Sunday morning, where the outspoken Trump critic once again lashed out at the president.\n\n\u201cThis guy should not be president, period,\u201d the Oscar winner told CNN host Brian Stelter.\n\nStelter then pointed out the flak De Niro has received from those, including Fox News pundits, who say he should keep out of politics. The actor raised ire when he declared \u201cF*** Trump\u201d during the 2018 Tony Awards.\n\nDe Niro\u2019s response to Stelter was just as raw. (The video clip posted below includes swearing.)\n\n\u201cF*** \u2018em,\u201d he said of his critics, raising his arms for emphasis. \u201cF*** \u2018em.\u201d\n\nFor those of you asking for the full interview with Robert De Niro: Here's the video of part one, addressing his criticism of President Trump. pic.twitter.com/2I1NwsmXun \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) September 29, 2019\n\nDe Niro followed that up with a \u201csorry,\u201d while Stelter cautioned him about the swearing.\n\n\u201cThis is cable, so it's not an FCC violation, but it is still a Sunday morning,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cWhy do you choose to go that way?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a moment in our lives, in this country, where this guy is like a gangster,\u201d the Godfather 2 star said. \u201cHe\u2019s come along and he\u2019s said things, done things ... This is terrible. We\u2019re in a terrible situation. We\u2019re in a terrible situation. And this guy just keeps going on and on and on without being stopped.\u201d\n\nDe Niro\u2019s language riled up supporters of the president, one of whom accused CNN of \u201cpromoting this ripe of aggressive and violence.\u201d Ryan Saavedra of conservative site The Daily Wire called it an \u201cabsolute clown show.\u201d\n\nPure class there Bobby...pure class. \u2014 Snowball (@WidowMaker187) September 29, 2019\n\nThis is very disrespectful! I grew up watching Robert De Niro movies I will never watch one again. This isn\u2019t the first time De Niro went on this crazy rant about the President. Instead of ranting how about praying for our leaders. \u2014 DEXTER HALL (@DEXTERHALL2) September 29, 2019\n\nDe Niro is painfully irrelevant. \u2014 O\u2019Dogg \u2618\ufe0f (@kpfresh73) September 29, 2019\n\nBut the 76-year-old star\u2019s comments also earned some praise.\n\n\u201cRobert De Niro is my Sunday morning mood. And Monday through Saturday too,\u201d tweeted director Ava DuVernay.\n\n\u201cAnybody who is more offended by what Robert De Niro said than what Donald Trump is actually doing is part of the problem,\u201d added CNN commentator Keith Boykin.\n\n\u201c#F***Em,\u201d tweeted actress and activist Alyssa Milano.\n\nMeghan McCain, meanwhile, complained about the response to De Niro\u2019s outburst.\n\nIf you don't think there's sexism in the media - look at how the women of the view are covered when we're passionate on a subject as opposed to every single man, on every single Sunday news show this morning! (and I've done many things but never, ever thrown out an F bomb on tv). \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) September 29, 2019\n\nElsewhere in the CNN interview, De Niro suggested that Trump is \u201ccrazy in a way\u201d and hit out at at Fox News pundits, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that they would actually buy into this craziness.\u201d\n\nRelated Video: Inquiry Incites Infighting at Fox News\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
