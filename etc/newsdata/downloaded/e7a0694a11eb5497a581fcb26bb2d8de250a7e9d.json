REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - A Banksy painting of primates sitting in Britain\u2019s parliament goes under the hammer next week and is expected to fetch up to $2.5 million (2 million pounds).\n\n\u201cDevolved Parliament\u201d, in which chimpanzees replace politicians, measures 13 feet (4 m) long, making it the largest known canvas by the secretive British street artist, according to Sotheby\u2019s.\n\nWith an eye on the 2009 work\u2019s extreme topicality - the House of Commons is witnessing increasingly brutish exchanges over Britain\u2019s EU departure - the auction house has set its estimated price tag at 1.5 million - 2 million pounds\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that today this image has incredible currency not just here in the UK but across Europe and beyond,\u201d said Alex Branczik, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art, Europe.\n\n\u201cHere we see this, one of our oldest democracies and within it we see the regression towards tribal animalistic behaviour.\u201d\n\nParliament has been at boiling point since it reconvened on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his opponents clashing in hours of furious argument over Brexit.\n\nThe artwork will be on display at Sotheby\u2019s London until it goes under the hammer on Oct. 3, a year after another Banksy canvas, \u201cGirl with Balloon\u201d, shredded itself in front of shocked onlookers at a Sotheby\u2019s auction just as it was sold.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been lots of comment, inevitably,\u201d Branczik said. \u201c...I can say categorically there is no shredder in this frame. It would have to be an incredibly large one and I can say with confidence that that is not the case.\u201d", "description": "A Banksy painting of primates sitting in Britain's parliament goes under the hammer next week and is expected to fetch up to $2.5 million (2 million pounds).", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434551321&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q11H", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
