On this occasion, Gary Holt\u2019s players had demonstrated their capacity for awkwardness by disrupting the champions\u2019 fluency and rhythm before the first half flashpoint occurred in the 26th minute when Ryan Christie and Scott Robinson contested a ball on the halfway line.\n\nChristie felled his opponent with a studs-up challenge into Robinson\u2019s shin and, even before the Livingston player hit the ground, Willie Collum had the red card on display. Celtic\u2019s response to the reduction in numbers was to increase their efforts proportionately and half-time arrived with the sides still level.", "description": "Livingston lived up to their leonine nickname with their first ever victory over Celtic as they also became the first domestic or European team to keep a clean sheet in 20 games against the Scottish champions this season while Rangers leapfrogged their rivals into top spot after a Jermain Defoe-inspired win over Hamilton Academical.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212194311_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqd5SWhp9nPo3USv930xWTiL9FNPOwLRy04X6yba0TKBs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
