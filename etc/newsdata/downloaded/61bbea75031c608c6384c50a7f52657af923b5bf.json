In December 2017, three female students reported him for sexual harassment. The college upheld some of their claims but he say he was never given a fair chance to defend himself\n\nA college professor called Justin Trudeau is suing the University of North Texas claiming he was treated unfairly during an investigation into sexual harassment allegations from three female students.\n\nTrudeau works as a communications professor at the college in Denton, Texas, and has done since 2005. He claims to have had an unblemished record until December 2017 when three students reported him for alleged sexual harassment.\n\nThey claimed, among other things, that he called their performances of scenes from an erotic book 'hot' and that he offered one female student an A if she 'convinced other students to perform in a sexual manner on stage'.\n\nHe insists that the allegations were baseless and that the university treated him unfairly by not keeping the contents of its investigation private, meaning other students and teachers found out about them.\n\nDespite the university ruling that some of the claims were true, Trudeau still works there. He was made to undergo sexual harassment training and was stopped from working during the summer of 2018 which he says cost him financially.\n\nNow, he is suing for damages in excess of $100,000 alleging he was never given an adequate chance to fight the allegations. He says they damaged his reputation and ability to work.\n\nHe only refers to some of the allegations as 'false' in his lawsuit and does not address those which the university said constituted violations of its policies.\n\nIn a lawsuit obtained by DailyMail.com, Trudeau's attorneys list the allegations.\n\nThe school investigated six and found they had 'sufficient evidence' to back up four.\n\nThose were that he called students' performances of scenes from A Director's Purpose 'hot and erotic'. The book was chosen by the students, he said, and it can be considered 'eroticism'.\n\nThe students said Trudeau told one female student that he would give her an A if she got the others to engage in a sexual 'manner' on stage and that he also made a 'sexual comment' and gave 'sexualized feedback' to a female student.\n\nThe University of North Texas where Trudeau has worked as a professor since 2005\n\nThey also alleged that he referred to a student with a history of mental illness as a 'psychopath'.\n\nTwo other allegations - that he referred to one female student's breasts and that he commented on another's attire - were never proven.\n\nThe students made the claims when filling out SPOT assessments of the course once it had been completed.\n\nTrudeau said he took the allegations to the university's governing body immediately.\n\nAfterwards, he says they were not properly investigated and he was not properly kept in the loop or given the chance to fight them.\n\n'[He] was wrongly accused. He defended himself.\n\n'Even if Dr. Trudeau was not personally the victim of discrimination, he is still entitled to sue if he has been retaliated against for participating and providing evidence in an investigation of a sexual harassment claim,' his attorney wrote in the lawsuit.\n\nHis attorney did not respond to DailyMail.com's inquiries immediately on Monday afternoon.", "description": "Trudeau works as a communications professor at the college in Denton, Texas, and has done since 2005.
