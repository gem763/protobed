A New York court earlier this month blocked that state's ban from taking effect.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Juul was sued in federal court in San Francisco by a Florida woman who said her son, Daniel Wakefield, died in his sleep at age 18 as a result of Juul use. The mother, Lisa Vail, is seeking unspecified damages.\n\nVail's lawsuit is the first wrongful death case to be brought against Juul, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company already faces a growing number of lawsuits by young adults and parents of teenagers against Juul and, in some cases, its parent company, Marlboro maker Altria Group.\n\nMost of the lawsuits say only that users became addicted to nicotine as a result of using Juul, but some allege serious health consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru and Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Sam Holmes)", "description": "Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer had ordered the state ban in September, declaring that teenagers' use of e-cigarettes, known as vaping, was a public health emergency.
