Sauytbay, who said she was brought in to teach Chinese and Communist propaganda to the other prisoners, said she witnessed inhuman atrocities before being granted asylum in Sweden.\n\nBefore Sauytbay\u2019s detention, her husband and two children were able to escape from their home across the border with Kazakhstan. But Sauytbay, who said her passport had been confiscated, was unable to join them and in 2017, she was taken to a \u201cre-education\u201d camp \u2013 she has no idea where it was located, she told Haaretz.\n\nRead more: China steals US designs for new weapons, and it\u2019s getting away with \u2018the greatest intellectual property theft in human history\u2019\n\n\u2018They would punish inmates for everything\u2019\n\nKazakhs are just one of the Turkic Muslim ethnic minorities detained in labor camps in Xinjiang, China. Recently, the plight of ethnic Uighurs in this part of China has gained international attention, with reports of organ harvesting coming to light at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in September.\n\nSauytbay also described horrific conditions during her detention, including inadequate health care, crowding, and almost nonexistent hygiene. Prisoners who were observant Muslims were forced to eat pork, a food that\u2019s considered haram, or forbidden, in Islam.\n\nSauytbay estimated there were around 2,500 prisoners at the camp, ranging in age from 13 to 84, and from a variety of backgrounds, all subject to the brutality of the Chinese state.\n\n\u201cThey would punish inmates for everything,\u201d Sauytbay told Stavrou through an interpreter. \u201cAnyone who didn\u2019t follow the rules was punished. Those who didn\u2019t learn Chinese properly or who didn\u2019t sing the songs were also punished,\u201d she said.\n\nPunishments could be anything from being deprived of food to having one\u2019s fingernails ripped out, or worse.\n\nRead more: Hong Kong\u2019s leader says she\u2019ll withdraw the controversial extradition bill. Protest leaders say it\u2019s \u2018too little, too late\u2019\n\nMedical experiments, forced contraception, and worse\n\nSauytbay describes being forced to witness a gang rape while at the camp. A young woman, she says, was forced to disrobe after being forced to \u201cconfess\u201d her sins in front of around 200 prisoners. The young woman was then raped by several police officers, Sauytbay said.\n\n\u201cWhile they were raping her they checked to see how we were reacting. People who turned their head or closed their eyes, and those who looked angry or shocked, were taken away and we never saw them again.\u201d\n\nThere were also medical experiments performed on the prisoners, according to Haaretz; they were forced to take pills and were given shots, but were not told the truth about what the medical procedures did. Some who were subjected to them report impotence and cognitive decline, according to reporting in Haaretz and The Believer.\n\nForced abortions and contraceptives have also been reported in The Washington Post and Haaretz. Women were forcibly fitted with intrauterine devices, and Ruqiye Perhat, a 31-year-old Uighur student of Islamic studies, is one of several women who reported being forced to have an abortion while in the camps. Perhat told The Post she was repeatedly raped by Chinese guards; she twice found herself pregnant and had the pregnancies forcibly terminated.\n\nThe Chinese government, which has detained more than a million members of ethnic minorities \u2013 mostly Uighurs according to Reuters \u2013 in internment camps in recent years, has told media outlets that reports of atrocities are untrue, and that the prison camps are educational and vocational centers meant to help the state counter terrorism. Earlier this year, Chinese officials said that a majority of detainees in Xinjiang had been released. However, the US State Department and the Pentagon released a statement saying they were \u201cunable to verify the vague claims,\u201d and experts remain doubtful, The New York Times reported.\n\nSeveral majority-Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, defended China\u2019s methods in a letter in July.", "description": "Business Insider - Sayragul Sauytbay escaped life in a Chinese prison camp, and she and her family were granted asylum in Sweden..
