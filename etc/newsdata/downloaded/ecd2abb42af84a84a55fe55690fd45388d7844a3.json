The mum or granny of the family often sits in the window, rolling gozleme and bases for their pizza-like lahmacun: I challenge you to find a better, cheaper lunch. I rarely make them at home though as I\u2019m not as adept at rolling, but I found myself out of town the other day and craving them.\n\nSo this was dinner, with an ezme salad featuring mandarin, inspired by a recent trip to the restaurant Bubala in London, where they put grapefruit in theirs. I am sure neither of these dishes are traditional: I\u2019ve simplified the lahmacun dough and added a few things like harissa to the ezme salad, but that\u2019s exactly what recipes should be, and what I love about where I live in London: a tapestry of food, people and culture.\n\nLahmacun with sumac, cumin and herbs (pictured above)\n\nLahmacun are often nicknamed \u201cTurkish pizzas.\u201d There are as many variations of these flatbreads in Turkey as there are pizzas in Italy, from bazlama to manaqish, depending on where you are. The breads vary in how the dough comes together and how they are cooked, as well as what they are topped with. I obviously go for the vegetarian version: here, earthy spices lift finely chopped sweet peppers and late-summer tomatoes.\n\nPrep 45 min\n\nRest 1 hr\n\nCook 5 min\n\nMakes 4 pizzas\n\nFor the pizza dough\n\n350ml luke-warm water\n\n1 tbsp dried yeast\n\n1 pinch sugar\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n\n500g strong white bread flour (or 00 pasta flour)\n\n1 pinch salt\n\nFor the topping\n\n2 red peppers, deseeded and chopped\n\n3 tomatoes, finely chopped\n\n1 fresh green chilli\n\n2 garlic cloves\n\n2 tsp cumin seeds\n\n1 tsp ground coriander\n\n1 tbsp tomato puree\n\nZest of \u00bd lemon\n\nTo serve\n\n1 handful fresh mint, roughly chopped\n\n1 handful fresh parsley, roughly chopped\n\n1 tsp sumac\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n\nMix the warm water, yeast, sugar and oil in a bowl, and leave for about 10 minutes.\n\nIn a stand mixer with a dough hook, mix the flour and salt for a few seconds. Then, with the motor still running, slowly add the liquid, and keep mixing until the dough no longer sticks to the sides and is soft, glossy and stretchy \u2013 about five minutes. Alternatively, you can mix the dough and then knead by hand for 10 minutes. Stretch the dough between two hands, if you can see through the thin layer of dough that forms then it\u2019s ready.\n\nCover the dough so it\u2019s airtight, and leave somewhere warm for about an hour. Once it has doubled in size, turn out and knead for a few more minutes, until soft.\n\nHeat the oven to its hottest setting and put a pizza stone or heavy-based frying pan in to get really hotside.\n\nFinely chop or blitz the topping ingredients in a food processor to a rough, salsa-like texture. Season well with salt, then pour the topping into a sieve and stir until most of the liquid has drained off, and you\u2019re left with a thick, tomatoey salsa-sauce.\n\nOn a well floured surface, split the dough into four and roll each piece out into a 5mm-thick round. Remove the hot pan from the oven and carefully put a circle of dough into the pan. Put two tablespoons of the sauce on top and spread evenly in a nice, thin layer.\n\nBake for about five minutes, until bubbly, golden and charred at the edges. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the fresh herbs and sumac, then finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Repeat with the rest of the dough and topping and serve immediately.\n\nEzme salad\n\nAn absolute staple of Turkish cuisine. You will find a bowl of this spicy salad as part of many meze spreads. I first tried it in an east London takeaway, alongside falafel, Turkish feta and stewed green beans, and now I can\u2019t get enough. Leave the flavours to mingle for a couple of hours if you can.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tomatoes, onions, clementines, capers ... a Turkish ezme salad with a few untraditional additions.\n\nPrep 20 min\n\nServes 4 as a side\n\n2 ripe vine tomatoes, finely chopped\n\n1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped\n\n1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped\n\n1 mandarin or clementine, peeled and segmented\n\n2 red peppers, finely chopped\n\n\u00bd cucumber, finely chopped\n\n2 tbsp capers\n\n\u00bd bunch parsley, leaves picked\n\nZest and juice of \u00bd a lemon\n\n2 tbsp pomegranate molasses\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n\n1 pinch each salt and pepper\n\n1 tbsp harissa\n\n\u00bd tsp sumac\n\n1 pinch chilli flakes\n\nPut the tomatoes, onion, garlic, mandarin, peppers, cucumber, capers and parsley in a serving bowl.\n\nIn a jar or small bowl, mix or shake the lemon juice and zest, pomegranate molasses, olive oil, salt, pepper and harissa together.
