We also had had a good sense that Mr. Market wasn\u2019t focused on the same information, or \u2014 if he was \u2014 he wasn\u2019t drawing the same conclusions. That was our differentiation. Ultimately, that is what drove our excess returns.\n\nSo, over the five years that we owned this stock, guess how many times we met with the CEO?\n\nThree.\n\nSure, we also met with the CFO a few times, and had a dozen or so calls with investor relations (if that), but we got everything we needed from the CEO in those three visits. Moreover, we didn\u2019t learn anything that the market hadn\u2019t heard already, or didn\u2019t know \u2014 we just simply observed what information was being presented to the consensus investor. It was our job to then decide which of that information mattered, and which didn\u2019t.\n\nVisiting the CEO every quarter over these five years wasn\u2019t going to make a difference. If anything, it might have even made us less objective about the information we gathered. It may have even given us a false sense of confidence, as hearing the same thing over again might have led to us overweighting possible outcomes simply because we\u2019d heard the same information multiple times from the same source.\n\nThis can be particularly true in cases where the CEO is overly optimistic about the prospects of his company. While this wasn\u2019t the case here, we\u2019ve seen this sort of enthusiasm countless times (and been burned by it as well).\n\nYet the number of company meetings a fund manager or analyst does is often wheeled out to potential fund investors as an indicator of hard work, or access, or effort.\n\nIn our case, the successful investment is a global business listed in Europe. I won\u2019t say more than that. But the principle absolutely applies to U.S. companies as well. As a student of behavioral finance and a disciple of Richard Thaler, I believe the key to generating market-beating returns is mitigating our personal biases when making investment decisions. Others in the market, and perhaps the market in aggregate, may not be as objective. When they aren\u2019t, we have that mismatch needed to succeed.\n\nSuccessful stockpicking isn\u2019t merely about being contrarian, per se; it is about understanding why we are. Whoever is the most objective can see that, and wins.\n\nAs a young analyst at a large mutual fund company, I remember some of the marketing pitches we would make. We did a lot of company meetings. At the time, we probably did more than anyone else in the world. I\u2019m not even kidding. And we thereafter \u2014 in our meetings with consultants and investors \u2014 always highlighted the \u201cnumber of company visits\u201d as if they were some proxy for excess returns.\n\nGuess what? They weren\u2019t.\n\nSure, it sounds great in marketing meetings to say \u201cwe\u2019ve visited with management a dozen times in the past two years and done three site visits\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean anything about stock-picking. It doesn\u2019t mean anything about excess returns. But it might say something about bias.\n\nSo if someone says they\u2019ve visited management for the sixth time this year, maybe just ask them \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\nDrew Dickson is the chief investment officer at Albert Bridge Capital, a London-based manager of concentrated equity portfolios for institutional investors.
