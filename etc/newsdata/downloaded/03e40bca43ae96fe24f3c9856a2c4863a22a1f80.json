sure,\u201d said Neville.\n\n\u201cWe got punished for two lapses in concentration when the game should have been dead and buried.\n\n\u201cThings probably aren\u2019t going for us the way they were 12 months ago, but that\u2019s football.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say is I can look my players in the eye, and they can look each other in the eye and say they played a really good game of football.\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s Lionesses are now without a win in five games, four of the last five fixtures having ended in defeat for the World Cup semi-finalists.\n\nHaving beaten Brazil in friendly a year ago, and in February at the SheBelieves Cup, England still seem to be suffering from a World Cup hangover.\n\nYet Neville does not appear to be worried, insisting, despite the recent run of defeats, that his side are still playing at the level of a \u2018top team\u2019,\n\n\u201cWhen we went to Norway [a 2-1 loss] and Belgium [a 3-3 draw], we looked after the game and knew that was nowhere near the level this team should be playing at,\u201d added Neville.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve just seen is we\u2019re at the level of a top, top team.\n\n\u201cWe kept going right until the very end and it was some of the best football I\u2019ve seen us play for a long time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stick together and believe in what we\u2019re doing is right.\u201d\n\nNeville will be hoping his team can get back to winning ways when they face Portugal on Tuesday night before the Lionesses host Germany at Wembley in November with 75,000 tickets having already been sold.",
