The goal was to better help veterans adjust to civilian life after leaving the Forces.\n\nSince then, the charter has undergone numerous changes \u2014 none of which have satisfied veterans who complain it provides far less financial support and who want the old pensions re-instated.\n\nThat demand manifested itself in the high-profile Equitas lawsuit filed in 2012 by six disabled Afghan war veterans, whom many former service members saw as champions for the cause of fairness for all ex-military personnel.\n\nThe Harper government also closed several Veterans Affairs Canada offices and slashed hundreds of department jobs \u2014 including frontline staff working directly with veterans \u2014 to balance the federal budget, resulting in huge delays in claims.\n\nWatch: Andrew Scheer makes promises to veterans\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer says his party would legislate a 'military covenant' to change the way government interacts with veterans. 0:35\n\nIf there was one moment that captured how bad the relationship between Harper's Conservatives and veterans got, it was when then-veterans affairs minister Julian Fantino in May 2014 refused to speak to the wife of a veteran struggling with PTSD who wanted more support for families and ducked out before she was scheduled to appear before a House committee.\n\nFantino was later replaced by Erin O'Toole, a former air-force officer who was starting to fix the Tories' relationship with veterans when Justin Trudeau took the stage during an election-campaign event in Belleville, Ont., on Aug. 24, 2015 and made his pitch.\n\nIn an appearance a few kilometres from CFB Trenton, Trudeau made a promise to veterans.\n\n\"If I earn the right to serve this country as your prime minister, no veteran will be forced to fight their own government for the support and compensation that they have earned,\" Trudeau said in apparent reference to the Equitas lawsuit.\n\n\"We will re-instate lifelong pensions and increase their value in line with the obligation we have made to those injured in the line of duty.\"\n\nIt was exactly what many veterans had been waiting to hear. Four years later, however, faith in the Liberals has all but disappeared.\n\nNew plan not necessarily better\n\nThe Liberals re-opened the closed Veterans Affairs offices, increased some services and benefits for veterans and hired hundreds of staff at Veterans Affairs Canada. But the backlog of veterans waiting to hear whether they qualify for assistance has grown to nearly 40,000 as hiring and the department's budget failed to keep up with demand.\n\nAnd not only did the Liberals continue to fight the Equitas lawsuit, which the Supreme Court tossed last year, they also failed to bring back the previous disability pensions and instead introduced their own version.\n\nThis past February, the parliamentary budget office reported disabled veterans would have received on average 1 1/2 times more over their lifetimes under the pre-2006 pension than through the Liberals' so-called Pension for Life.\n\nThat led to fresh allegations the government was trying to support veterans on the cheap.\n\nAnd while the PBO found many veterans will see small increases in financial compensation compared with the 2005 charter, it also reported that some of the most severely disabled would actually receive less.\n\nIn January 2018, one month after the Liberals unveiled the Pension for Life, Trudeau was confronted during a townhall meeting in Edmonton by Brock Blaszczyk, who lost a leg in Afghanistan. Blaszczyk wanted to know: Why was the government still fighting the Equitas lawsuit?\n\n\"Why are we still fighting against certain veterans' groups in court?\" Trudeau responded. \"Because they're asking for more than we are able to give right now.\"\n\nThe comment still elicits outrage.\n\nPromises and silence\n\nNow Scheer is appealing to veterans to trust him. During a campaign event in Prince Edward Island last weekend, the Conservative Leader attacked Trudeau's record before laying out his own plan to help veterans.\n\nThose include clearing the backlog of applications for assistance, introducing legislation enshrining in law a \"military covenant\" between the government and veterans, and creating a \"reliable, dependable pension system\" that is \"fair to Canada's most disabled veterans.\"\n\nThe Liberals have yet to say what they will do for veterans. The NDP and the Greens have talked about a review of the current suite of benefits; the Greens say they will \"restore periodic payments\" at pre-2006 levels.\n\nRetired major Mark Campbell was one of the plaintiffs in the Equitas case. While he is critical of the Harper government's treatment of vets, he is willing to give Scheer a chance.\n\n\"Looking forward right now, as I see it, we have a set of promises from the Conservatives that look actually quite good at first blush and we have a deafening silence from the Liberals.\"\n\nOthers such as retired master corporal Paul Franklin, who made headlines for having to prove to Veterans Affairs each year that he had lost both legs in Afghanistan, remain more circumspect.\n\n\"We don't trust these guys,\" Franklin said. \"It almost comes down to a point where we either have to vote local or vote on other reasons and sadly forget our own reasons to vote as a group or make the individual choice if you wish to trust the leadership.\"\n\nBack at his home near Saskatoon, Jorgensen already knows what he is going to do: \"I will be striking my ballot,\" he says. \"I will be striking my ballot.\"", "description": "Parties face outrage as they seek to court a segment of the population that feels betrayed by successive governments over the past 14 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4992792.1569682464!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/veterans-ptsd-20130602.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
