If he weakens, that fear will subside.\u201d\n\nHowever, increased political polarisation in recent years means that most Republicans are expected to stick with Mr Trump \u201cas long as their own status is not in danger\u201d, according to the professor.\n\nIn 1974, three top Republican leaders in Congress famously visited Richard Nixon at the White House to inform him that he faced near-certain impeachment over the Watergate scandal.\n\nNixon, who had fought the scandal for months, announced his resignation the next day.\n\nMore than 40 years later, a highly-polarised Washington is not expected to come to a bipartisan agreement on the issue of impeachment, especially with Mr Trump having strong support within the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cIn the past in the US, party members would dissociate themselves from disgraced leaders in order to preserve the party and their own reputations,\u201d Professor Nick Smith, who teaches ethics and philosophy at the University of New Hampshire, said.\n\n\u201cBut now President Trump seems to have such a personal hold on the party \u2013 more like a cult leader than a US president \u2013 that the exits are closed as the party transforms into his image.\u201d\n\nKathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Public Policy Centre, added that with the death of John McCain last year, there is no Republican figure with enough power to challenge Mr Trump.\n\n\u201cWho would go and be credible with Donald Trump, so that he would listen?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMitt Romney? Mitch McConnell? Lindsey Graham? Trump will turn on any of them the minute they say something uncongenial.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTrump's 'troubling' calls to world leaders revealed by officials\n\nThe president attacked Mr Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, on Saturday for criticising his call for China to investigate his 2020 election rival Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Mr Romney wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn response, Mr Trump referred to the senior Republican as a \u201cpompous ass\u201d who \u201cnever knew how to win\u201d.\n\nAgencies contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\nRead more Trump's 'troubling' calls to world leaders revealed by officials", "description": "Every Republican in Congress has \u201cbeef\u201d with Donald Trump but they are too afraid to challenge him, a political science professor has claimed.Cal Jillson, a professor at Southern Methodist University, has said that Republicans could turn on the president if they see him as a threat to their own party", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0.BjitNWaMH93oZdQR5QAg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/bc480a8c356647155ca14e2b04f38434", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
