I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTo stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere comes a point when the only thing to do is to stand up to this behaviour, because it destroys people and destroys lives.\n\n\u201cPut simply, it is bullying, which scares and silences people. We all know this isn\u2019t acceptable, at any level. We won\u2019t and can\u2019t believe in a world where there is no accountability for this.\u201d\n\nRead more: Meghan Markle struggles to sleep at night because of her father\u2019s betrayal, according to an extraordinary letter he leaked which ends by saying \u2018a lie can\u2019t live forever\u2019\n\nThe case is being privately funded by the couple, and any damages won will be donated to an anti-bullying charity, their lawyers have confirmed.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether Markle winning this case alone would change her relationship with the press.\n\nEven following Prince Harry\u2019s win against Splash News, the British media have continued to manipulate the way the couple are portrayed in headlines. A recent example of this was when they were criticized for flying by private jet to Elton John\u2019s home in the South of France, despite John saying that he paid for the jet to be carbon neutral.\n\nTherefore, this lawsuit \u2013 whether successful or not \u2013 is not likely to limit the amount of tabloid gossip aimed at the couple.\n\nHowever, if Markle and Harry make a habit of taking legal action in the future \u2013 as Harry\u2019s statement implies \u2013 this should make the press proceed with more caution when it comes to the couple\u2019s privacy.\n\nThe couple will still have social media trolls to contend with\n\nIn his statement, Harry compared Markle\u2019s treatment by the press to the treatment of his mother, the late Princess Diana.\n\nHowever, one thing Diana didn\u2019t have to face was the scrutiny through social media, as pointed out by Joe Little, managing editor at Majesty magazine.\n\n\u201cSomething had to happen, because since the Sussexes\u2019 wedding last year Meghan in particular has been criticized a great deal for all manner of things in the tabloid media, both online and in print. On social media there has been much trolling \u2013 very unpleasant stuff \u2013 and that has made a bad situation even worse,\u201d Little told Insider.\n\nFormer Daily Mirror editor and Guardian columnist Roy Greenslade agrees with this sentiment \u2013 even going as far as to say the couple are wasting their time by going after the press.\n\n\u201cThe press \u2013 particularly the tabloid press \u2013 is far less powerful now than it was during his mother\u2019s era,\u201d he told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, according to BBC News.\n\n\u201cIs he taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut here? I think he may well find that this is counter-productive.\u201d\n\nRead more: Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton can seemingly do nothing right on social media, but royal experts say it\u2019s a \u2018necessary evil\u2019\n\nThe palace has made an effort to restrict negative social media comments in the past, even releasing a set of official social guidelines to the public.\n\nOf course, it would be impossible to sue every person to write a false tweet about the couple. It makes sense, then, that they are instead going after those who can be held accountable for their actions.\n\n\u201cIn the final years of her life Diana came in for close media scrutiny by the tabloids and, as Harry and William witnessed, this upset her greatly. Thankfully, there was no social media back then,\u201d Little added.\n\n\u201cHarry is therefore doing all he can to prevent this happening with Meghan.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nEllen DeGeneres, Pink, and Elton John are defending Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for traveling by private jet.
