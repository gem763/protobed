This index scores companies on how well they reveal their policies governing a range of political spending.\n\n\u201cThe index indicates that U.S. public companies are acknowledging and taking solid steps to manage the heightened risks from political spending,\u201d said Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, in a news release.\n\n\u201cWe saw this in improved company scores and heard it in substantive conversations with 60 companies that contacted us. They\u2019re concerned about protecting themselves from today\u2019s inflamed political climate.\u201d\n\nThe 73 companies received index scores of 90% or higher to earn a \u201cTrendsetter\u201d designation in the study. Four companies got scores of 100% \u2014 Becton Dickinson & Co. BDX, -0.99% , Edwards Lifesciences Corp. EW, +5.16% , HP Inc. HPQ, -0.55% and Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC, -0.91%\n\nCenter for Political Accountability, Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research Board oversight of corporate political spending keeps rising.\n\nIn addition, the two centers said that the average index score evaluating overall political disclosure and accountability for the 399 companies that have remained constant S&P components since 2015 has continued to rise, hitting 53.3% this year versus 41.6% in 2015.", "description": "As the political climate gets tough, companies get more careful.
