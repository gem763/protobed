This will obstruct the ability of families to support themselves for months to come, it added.\n\nDespite its richness in oil, South Sudan is among the world's poorest nations.\n\nThe country secured independence from north Sudan in 2011 after decades of war but descended into its own conflict at the end of 2013.\n\nUnder pressure from regional and international powers, the warring sides signed a peace accord in September 2018 but its rollout has been delayed.", "description": "Heavy flooding since July has submerged entire communities and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes, OCHA says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2015/11/4/b20faf0850e14a1395376d0d0c0ce3f4_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
