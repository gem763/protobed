Yes, Ukraine Call Notes Show", "language": "en", "text": "Displayed on a monitor, U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the United Nations General Assembly at UN headquarters on September 24, 2019 in New York City. (Photo: Drew Angerer / Getty)\n\nThe so-called \u201ctranscript\u201d of a July 25 phone call between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart serves as a poignant reminder of how absurd conspiracy theories \u2014 even ones widely and thoroughly debunked for many years \u2014 have come to influence daily life in the Oval Office.\n\nThe White House released the \u201ctranscript\u201d \u2014 which is, in reality, a series of compiled notes without independent verification \u2014 following the announcement of a House impeachment inquiry on Tuesday. The inquiry was prompted by a controversial whistleblower complaint in which an anonymous intelligence official alleged Trump threatened to withhold $US400 ($592) million in military and security aid from Ukraine unless the nation opened an investigation into his 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s discussion with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also contains a number of bizarre references to a computer server and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, the company the Democratic National Committee (DNC) enlisted to investigate the attacks on its servers by Russian hacking groups Cosy Bear and Fancy Bear in 2016. At one point, Trump even appears to suggest that \u201cthe server\u201d itself is being stored in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favour though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump reportedly said on the call to Zelensky. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d (The ellipses in the supposed transcript are part of the text released by the White House. It\u2019s unclear whether they indicate a pause in the president\u2019s speech or that text has been removed.)\n\nSince 2017, Trump has repeatedly claimed that there is a \u201cmissing\u201d DNC server, as if to imply there\u2019s some sort of cover-up underway. But not only is there no server missing, the attack did not involve just a single \u201cserver.\u201d As the Daily Beast reported over a year ago:\n\nThe \u201cserver\u201d Trump is obsessed with is actually 140 servers, most of them cloud-based, which the DNC was forced to decommission in June 2016 while trying to rid its network of the Russian GRU officers working to help Trump win the election, according to the figures in the DNC\u2019s civil lawsuit against Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nBeing notably inept when it comes to basically all forms of technology, Trump has for years tried to make hay of the fact the DNC didn\u2019t turn over its servers to the FBI. But as any expert in computer forensics knows \u2014 and the president has 17 intelligence agencies he could call to ask about this \u2014 physical access to the hardware is entirely pointless. Instead, what forensic investigators do and have done basically forever is make exact copies of the hard drives called \u201cimages\u201d to inspect. Unplugging a server to physically move it (again, entirely pointless) would only lead to potential data loss in the machine\u2019s memory.\n\nAside from Trump\u2019s apparent confusion about how cloud computing works, his reference to a \u201cwealthy\u201d Ukrainian likely stems from his own mistaken belief that CrowdStrike is owned by a Ukrainian billionaire. Trump told the Associated Press in June 2017: \u201cI heard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that\u2019s what I heard.\u201d The AP didn\u2019t push back on the claim at the time, but it is inaccurate.\n\nTrump\u2019s confusion likely originates with a series of 2017 news articles that highlighted CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch\u2019s role as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. The Washington, D.C.-based think tank is funded in part by various government agencies, including the U.S. State Department, but has also received funding from Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk. (Alperovitch was himself born in Moscow, but immigrated to the U.S. after the U.S.S.R. collapsed.)\n\nIronically, the New York Times reported last year that Pinchuk had donated around $222,150 to President Trump\u2019s foundation in 2015 in exchange for a 20-minute chat with the would-be president.\n\nCrowdStrike did not respond to a request for comment, but a senior official at the company told Motherboard today, when asked why Trump mentioned the company during the call, \u201cI got nothing.\u201d\n\nCrowdstrike's sole public statement on today's transcript in no way reflects how funny some of its employees think this is pic.twitter.com/uzSSxJeE3n \u2014 Kevin Collier (@kevincollier) September 25, 2019\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about the Zelensky call is that it appears to show that Trump is not only spreading disinformation about the investigation into Russia hacking in 2016, but that he also seems to believe at least some of what he\u2019s saying. His remarks to Zelensky obviously weren\u2019t tweets crafted to disparage Democrats or fire up his supporters, but are instead part of a private phone conversation that, one assumes, he never intended to make public.\n\nDespite, again, having over dozen intelligence agencies at his disposal (not to mention all of the public reporting on this subject over the past two years) Trump seems to truly believe there\u2019s some missing server floating around in the world somewhere and that CrowdStrike \u2014 which is headquartered in California, by the way \u2014 is a company controlled by some Ukrainian oligarch whose name he can\u2019t recall, despite having spent actual face-time with the man.\n\nWhatever else these so-called transcripts show, they speak to at least one truth: The president is a big dumb gullible idiot.", "description": "The so-called \u201ctranscript\u201d of a July 25 phone call between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart serves as a poignant reminder of how absurd conspiracy theories \u2014 even ones widely and thoroughly debunked for many years \u2014 have come to influence daily life in the Oval Office....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Catie Keck"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/o8ma0ufvzuhsfsdepb9m.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
