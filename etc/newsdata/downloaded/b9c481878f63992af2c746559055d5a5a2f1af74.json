Officials refused to say how much the deal will cost due to commercial confidentiality.\n\nThe Mirror highlighted the case of cystic fibrosis suffered Luis Walker, nine, whose life would be transformed by the treatment.\n\n(Image: Adam Gerrard / Daily Mirror)\n\nHe wrote to Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cI have Cystic Fibrosis. I need Orkambi, lots of other people do too. I have written to Theresa May and Vertex. It didn't help. Please would you be the one to help me.\"\n\nMr Corbyn said today: \"This is life changing for everyone with cystic fibrosis in our country, they've waited years for this drug.\n\n\"A victory for all the campaigners who have taken on big pharmaceutical companies' greed and government inaction. When we stand together and take on the powerful, we win.\"\n\nLuis\u2019s mother Christina Coombes told the Mirror that having Orkambi means \u201cLuis will live longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NHS said the drug will be able available with in four weeks and that means we could have it in time for Christmas.\n\n\u201cThat would be the best Christmas present ever. I keep bursting into tears but they are tears of joy.\u201d\n\n(Image: Adam Gerrard / Daily Mirror)\n\nShe said that other children who had the drug had been able to breath more easily and have more energy.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is it prevents his condition from getting any worse and reduces the number of future infections and hospitalisations.\n\n\u201cIn the longer term he\u2019s going to live longer.\u201d\n\nMs Coombes praised Mr Corbyn for raising Luis\u2019s case at Labour conference.\n\n\u201cIt put the issue in the spotlight and raised it to another level. It put real pressure on Vertex and the government. I am really grateful.\u201d\n\nAsked how Luis had reacted on hearing the news, she said he told \"oh good. That means I don't have to write any more letters.\"\n\nThose eligible for Orkambi will be those aged two or older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.\n\nThe drug Symkevi will also be available and access to Kalydeco will be expanded for eligible patients aged 12 or older under today's deal.\n\nAlthough the deal is for England, the NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland must now be offered similar terms if their health chiefs demand them.\n\nThe deal was struck after Vertex agreed to submit its drugs for appraisal by the regulator NICE up to September 2021. But in return the cost to taxpayers will remain confidential.\n\n(Image: Adam Gerrard / Daily Mirror)\n\nNHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: \"Given the time it has taken for the company to reach this agreement, there must be no further delay. So I expect NHS clinicians should be able to start offering these treatments within 30 days from today.\n\n\"We have only been able to finalise this negotiation because the company has now agreed confidential commercial terms that constitute good value for British taxpayers. As a result, NICE has also been able to support the agreement.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the deal was \"wonderful news\".\n\nHe added: \"We\u2019ve agreed a deal to provide Orkambi and other lifesaving Cystic Fibrosis drugs on the NHS.\n\n\"The deal is great value for money for the NHS, and crucially, will improve thousands of lives.\n\n\"This deal - on the back of several others this summer - shows why we get some of the best value drugs in the world, and is another reason to be so proud of our NHS.\u201d\n\nLudovic Fenaux, Senior Vice President of Vertex International, said: \"Today is a significant day for the cystic fibrosis community in England.\n\n\"This important agreement, reached in collaboration and partnership with NHS England and NICE, will allow more than 5,000 eligible cystic fibrosis patients in England to have access to CFTR modulators to treat the underlying cause of their disease.\"", "description": "Vertex and NHS England have now struck a deal for Orkambi to help 5,000 patients after Jeremy Corbyn took up the case of nine-year-old Luis Walker", "authors": ["Jason Beattie", "Dan Bloom", "Image", "Adam Gerrard", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20166548.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_AGP_MDM_230919LUIS_001JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
