Shares are presently priced at less than $14 and are lingering fewer than four points from record lows seen at the end of last year.\n\nYes, the impact of newly-imposed tariffs and the ensuing economic headwind played a major part in that pullback.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTake a closer look though. While the economic backdrop has remained uncertain and best and concerning at worst, iQiyi is surviving. In fact, it\u2019s thriving. The biggest challenge facing IQ stock is inspiring investors to take notice.\n\nA Closer Look at iQiyi\n\nIt\u2019s often called the Netflix of China, although that\u2019s not the best comparison. It\u2019s actually more akin to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) property YouTube, in that it allows users to upload their own video content in addition to the digital content curated by iQiyi. The comparison is particularly more appropriate now that YouTube offers subscription-based access to traditional cable programming and originals.\n\nRegardless of the most relevant comparison though, two facets about the company have remained largely overlooked during the past few turbulent months. One of them is, there\u2019s nothing else in China quite like it. The other is, Chinese consumers increasingly love their iQiyi service.\n\nNumbers tell the tale, for investors that care about such details.\n\nTake last quarter\u2019s headcount for example. As of the end of its second fiscal quarter, the company boasted a little over 99 million paying members, a figure that was up 50% year-over-year. To that end, revenue improved 15% year-over-year, reaching $1.0 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s still bleeding money, which perhaps is the biggest mental hurdle for would-be IQ stock owners. Losses continue to swell too, reaching $339.0 million in the second quarter. Selling and administrative expenses and R&D spending made up a huge amount of its spending growth that led to widening losses.\n\nIf the pros are right though, this young company is already at the profit turning point. From here, spending should stabilize, but revenue should continue to grow.\n\n\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\n\n\nThe Near Future and IQ Stock\n\nThat\u2019s a tremendously big \u201cif,\u201d of course. iQiyi is still a startup, and doesn\u2019t enjoy the deep pockets rival players like Youku-Tudou and Tencent Video have. Tencent Video is a project owned and operated by Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), while Youku is a subsidiary of eCommerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).\n\nBy many measures, however, iQiyi may be better served by operating independently of China\u2019s more established digital technology companies.\n\nNot unlike Netflix in its infancy, iQiyi doesn\u2019t have any other companies standing over its shoulder and scrutinizing every decision it makes. That allows it to lay the proper foundation first, setting the stage for the same kind of market dominance Netflix enjoys in the western hemisphere now. Profits aren\u2019t quite the point just yet.\n\nIQ stock is also China\u2019s only real pure play on the streaming video market, which is something focused investors like.", "description": "The premise of iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) was lauded in the middle of last year, shortly before and then after the company went public.
