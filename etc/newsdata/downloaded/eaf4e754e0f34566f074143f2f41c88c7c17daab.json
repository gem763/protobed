The problem is you never know you have a drone until one crashes, so you don't know how many successful deliveries you had\", he said.\n\nThe new SkyFence system will be rolled out ready for action by the end of July.\n\nIt will be the first time the new technology is to be deployed, according to Drone Defence founder, Richard Gill, whose company created the system.\n\nBlank screen\n\nGill said SkyFence detects a drone and then activates a disruptive electronic fence that covers the whole of the prison like a dome.\n\n\"The fence disrupts the command video signals that the drone sends to its operator on the ground. The operator sees a blank screen and can no longer fly or control the drone\", he said.\n\nDepending on the size of the site, the system costs between \u00a3100 000 and \u00a3250 000.\n\nThe British government last month announced the creation of a new team to tackle drones flying into prisons.\n\nThere have been a number of drone-related convictions, with two men jailed on Tuesday for flying cocaine, cannabis and cellphones into The Mount prison northwest of London.", "description": "A British prison will install anti-drone technology to stop contraband being smuggled through the skies, the jail's governor says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5252/b1285f120d5441888d8195fb081cbc2e.jpg", "published_at": "2017-05-17"}
