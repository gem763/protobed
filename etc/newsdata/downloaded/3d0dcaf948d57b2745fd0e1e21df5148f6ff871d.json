REUTERS/Njeri Mwangi\n\nMore than 70,000 people are bitten in East Africa each year, and climate change and deforestation are worsening the problem, as snakes get pushed out of natural habitats into populated areas.\n\nNearly 100 snakes live at the research centre in a forest on the outskirts of the capital.\n\nResearchers extract venom and study it before injecting small amounts into donor animals, such as sheep, which then produce antibodies to be harvested and purified into antivenom.\n\n\u201cUp to (now), no one has produced any kind of antivenom in Kenya,\u201d said senior snake handler Geoffrey Maranga Kepha.\n\nTwo effective antivenoms are available in Kenya, from India and Mexico, the centre says.\n\nBut many ineffective products circulate in sub-Saharan Africa, said David Williams, head of the Australian Venom Research Unit.\n\n\u201cOne Indian product marketed in Ghana as a replacement to Sanofi\u2019s actually increased the death rate for snakebites,\u201d he added.\n\nVaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur, part of French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA), stopped producing antivenom for African snakes in 2010 because low demand and competition from a cheaper supplier made it unprofitable.\n\nSanofi wants to share its knowledge with partners who could handle production, the company told Reuters in a statement.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nThe centre is teaching communities that swift use of antivenom saves lives, said veterinarian and head researcher George Adinoh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird or risky job, but after seeing how people die in Kenya from snakebites I decided to devote my life to coming up with a rescue measure that will help, or prevent people from dying from snakebites,\u201d snake handler Kepha added.\n\n(The story refiles to amend headline).", "description": "Kenyan mother Beth Mwende heard her sleeping three-year-old cry out, but did not worry further after the child quickly settled - until the next morning, when she found her daughter, Mercy, semi-conscious with two fang marks in the neck.", "authors": ["Ayenat Mersie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446145594&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0PJ", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
