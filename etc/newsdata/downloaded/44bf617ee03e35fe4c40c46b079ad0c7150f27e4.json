But for all other financial products, including insurance and superannuation, there are exceptions.\n\nHawking of those products is permitted as long as the calls or unsolicited meetings take place at certain times of day, the target is not on a no-call register and has been given the opportunity to sign up to a no-call register, and they have been provided with a product disclosure statement prior to signing up to any product. The hawker must explain the importance of the PDS and even offer to read it out to the hawkee.\n\nWhen CommInsure realised it had failed to comply with these provisions while marketing its Simple Life products in 2014, it self-reported to ASIC.\n\nA breach of the rules automatically bring criminal charges, which carry both a financial penalty of up to $21,250 per charge, and a prison sentence of up to six months.\n\nJack Geng, a senior associate with law firm Barry Nilsson, said in this case the criminal charges were being brought against the company rather than an individual, meaning imprisonment was unlikely.\n\nHe said the law required the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to \"prove a mental element\". \"So either a director, employee or agent had the necessary state of mind to engage in the contravened conduct,\" he said.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual in criminal proceedings for a defendant to enter an early plea in order to reduce the severity of the sentence. Australian courts will also take into account a range of other factors in sentencing such as totality, specific and general deterrence,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThe government is proposing to do get rid of the exceptions, but obviously that hasn\u2019t happened yet. I think there\u2019s a lot on the government's plate in terms of reforms at the moment.\"\n\nThe government has committed to bringing in an absolute ban on hawking of insurance and superannuation products by June 30, 2020. As yet it has not released draft legislation, so the exact nature of the ban is unclear. However, ASIC is currently consulting on bringing in a ban on hawking itself.", "description": "An upcoming ban on the hawking of insurance and super will severely limit the ability of large financial services companies to cross-sell their products.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1267%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/36a79f1b4ffb0d750a0c2ad9eff7bcee6212d54d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
