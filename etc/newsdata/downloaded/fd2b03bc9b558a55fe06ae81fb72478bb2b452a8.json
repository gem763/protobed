But in Congress\u2019s bipartisan condemnation of the Turkish incursion, Republicans and Democrats alike have jumped to pursuing one policy response: harsh sanctions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the White House announcement on Oct. 14 of sanctions on Turkey, Trump said, \u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path.\u201d\n\nThis is an unmistakable echo of the failed U.S. strategy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran and Venezuela. And just as with those two countries, it would be a humanitarian and geopolitical disaster.\n\nIn so much of our foreign policy, we rely on muscle memory and a limited toolbox to decide the best course of action. And too often sanctions regimes are ill considered, incoherent and counterproductive.\n\nResearch has shown that sanctions rarely achieve their desired goals. In the worst-case scenario, they hurt the people of a country \u2014 generally the very people we\u2019re purporting to help \u2014 without making a dent in the country\u2019s behavior. And in the case of human-rights abusers, research suggests that more abuses typically occur with economic sanctions in place than without them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanctions are not meant to be an end in themselves, but we too often use them as a lever without a plan for what comes after, whether they achieve the desired result or not.\n\nAfter years of improving relations between the United States and Iran, the sanctions put in place by the Trump administration have instead devastated that country\u2019s middle class and increased hostility toward the United States, with tensions between the two countries rising to dangerous levels.\n\nThe sanctions have simultaneously strengthened the Iranian regime\u2019s credibility at home and united human-rights activists and the Iranian leadership in opposition to the strategy. One dire effect of the sanctions has been an entirely preventable shortage of life-saving medicine. A group of Iranian women\u2019s rights activists recently wrote, \u201cWhile sanctions proponents claim to care for the Iranian people, their policies have left an entire nation weary, depressed and hopeless. Sanctions, and economic pressure, target the fabric of society.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same backward logic was applied to Venezuela, where the Trump administration intended to squeeze Nicol\u00e1s Maduro out of power through increasingly sweeping sanctions on the state oil company and then the central bank \u2014 only to find itself involved in an intractable crisis that risks descending into civil war.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that the bulk of the economic crisis in Venezuela was caused by Maduro\u2019s government, which inherited fixable problems and failed to address them. But U.S. sanctions have worsened Venezuela\u2019s economic disaster \u2014 and handed Maduro a propaganda victory. He can now shift blame to the United States, while retaining his grip on power.\n\nBoth of these cases point to a larger problem. Too often, U.S. policymakers are quick to place sanctions on regimes we disagree with, without considering the likelihood of success or the humanitarian consequences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is not a catch-all criticism of sanctions. The use of the Global Magnitsky Act, aimed at specific individuals responsible for gross human rights violations, can be an important mechanism for accountability if they are used consistently and not simply for our geopolitical rivals. And locally led boycott or divestment campaigns, such as the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, can be meaningful ways for those impacted to seek a peaceful resolution.\n\nBut economic and sector sanctions are too often designed to inflict maximum pain on civilians, not empower them. We had a full embargo on Cuba for decades, with little effect on the Cuban government but much pain inflicted on ordinary Cubans. It was only through diplomacy and direct conversation that President Barack Obama and the United States made progress in Cuba.\n\nThe same strategies should be applied to Syria. We could have negotiated a buffer zone in northern Syria, so that people outside of the Assad regime\u2019s control could create a peaceful life, without our greenlighting the slaughter of innocent Kurdish lives. We could ban weapons sales to Turkey (as Congress is contemplating), limiting Erdogan\u2019s ability to wage war without targeting the Turkish people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut addressing the root of the problem requires a foreign policy that doesn\u2019t prioritize warfare \u2014 whether military or economic.\n\nWe need a vision for a U.S. foreign policy that is rooted in the experiences of people directly affected and is sincere about putting human rights and democracy first. Questioning and changing the near-automatic reliance on sanctions is fully compatible with advancing our interests and defending national security. It\u2019s time to stop relying on the same failed playbook.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Democracy \u2014 and those affected \u2014 should be the priorities.", "authors": ["Ilhan Omar"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PuD1gKdl3zyghGfW3tZqNde0Ih0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TYMYIXHVDAI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
