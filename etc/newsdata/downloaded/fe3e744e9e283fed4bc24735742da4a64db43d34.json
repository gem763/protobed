Hundreds of thousands were sickened and thousands died after drinking poisonous bootleg alcohol.\n\nIn a macabre twist on that history, one of the unintended consequences of marijuana legalization might be the new epidemic of lung illness associated with vaping bootleg cannabis oil. Six deaths have been linked to vaping, and hundreds of people have been sickened. Most have been teens and young adults. Most were vaping illegal THC oil.\n\nI have been covering the story of contaminated THC for The Marijuana Times since spring. The trail began in April with a $5 million cache of illegal cannabis vape cartridges seized by the sheriff of Mendocino County, California, in a region where the lion\u2019s share of the black market cannabis consumed by Americans is grown and processed.\n\nWeed toxic enough to kill\n\nSheriff Thomas Allman decided on a hunch to have the oil tested. The lab reported it was contaminated with a stew of pesticides and a particular fungicide that, when heated to more than 400 degrees, breaks down to release deadly hydrogen cyanide. For that reason, it is banned for use on tobacco in the United States and \u2014 in Canada, Washington, Oregon and Colorado \u2014 on marijuana. According to the lab, the concentration of that fungicide \u2014 myclobutanil \u2014 in the batch Allman had tested was 7,300 times the limit set by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.\n\nVaping in Portland, Maine, Aug. 28, 2019. More\n\nThat was just one shipment. I wondered at the time how many black market batches had escaped interception, and whether the oil in those cartridges was as dangerous as it sounded. The answer could be upon us, and David Kurzfeld may have a key piece of evidence.\n\nContaminated cannabis is Kurzfeld\u2019s bread and butter. He is one of four partners who own a highly specialized business in Willits, California. Modular Processing Systems cleans contaminated oil for licensed producers. Kurzfeld says some of the oil they have processed arrived so filthy with pesticides, fungicides and other toxins that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare get it on my skin, let alone vape it.\u201d\n\nResearch lagging:Doctors and patients are flying blind as medical marijuana use rises\n\nKurzfeld, a fourth-generation Mendocino rancher and farmer, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge out here that if a legit grower has weed that won\u2019t pass the state test for contaminants, they just sell it into the black market.\u201d\n\nThese growers might be callous, but even if they were mindful they\u2019d run into a paradox \u2014 you can\u2019t have your illegal marijuana tested in a state licensed lab if you don\u2019t have a state license to grow or handle marijuana.\n\nAs for the state inspectors responsible for monitoring such things on the ground, Kurzfeld says there are too few to even take reports about contamination, let alone investigate them: \u201cFor some reason they don\u2019t last long. They either quit or get fired.\u201d\n\nAmerica's pot experiment is failing\n\nWhile public health officials try to pinpoint the chemistry or mechanism causing vaping-associated pulmonary illness, it seems an appropriate moment to call out an inconvenient truth about marijuana legalization: America\u2019s noble pot experiment is failing miserably.\n\nAs the largest producer of cannabis in the country, California ought to be setting the standard for oversight. Instead, cheap black market cannabis is so abundant, and scofflaws so bold, that a Los Angeles Times investigation in June found that more than half of that city\u2019s 400 or so dispensaries were unlicensed pop-up shops, and that they proliferate faster than the police can shut them down. Less visible are the hundreds, if not thousands, of private delivery services and individual dealers of outlaw cannabis.", "description": "Underground THC sales are risky.
