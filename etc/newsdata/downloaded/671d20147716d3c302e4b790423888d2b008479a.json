Southampton suffered their worst ever defeat as Ayoze P\u00e9rez and Jamie Vardy scored hat-tricks in a devastating rout to lift Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side second in the Premier League. Rodgers labelled Leicester\u2019s ruthless display as the perfect performance but insisted there is still more to come from his team.\n\nVardy and P\u00e9rez hat-tricks as Leicester smash nine against Southampton Read more\n\nSouthampton capitulated after Ryan Bertrand was sent off as a result of a high tackle on P\u00e9rez in the buildup to Ben Chilwell giving Leicester a 10th-minute lead. Youri Tielemans and James Maddison also got on the scoresheet before Vardy completed the scoring on a historic night from the penalty spot. The Southampton winger Nathan Redmond said it was an \u201cembarrassing performance\u201d which they will debrief in training on Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cI must apologise for this performance,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cI take 100% responsibility for what happened. I want to say that I\u2019m proud of the fans that were staying in the stadium until the end of the game because it was not easy to watch it for anybody who is a Southampton fan. We have to apologise for what happened. After the red card, every attack was a goal. There was no defending at all. When you act like this, you can\u2019t be surprised when you concede nine. You can call it if you want \u2018gave up\u2019, you can call it \u2018helpless\u2019, you can call it what you want. It was a disaster.\u201d\n\nThe mood could not be more different for Rodgers and Leicester, who ran riot from start to finish. \u201cIt was the perfect performance,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe showed a wonderful demonstration of how to play against 10 men. The players made it look a lot easier than it actually is. Tactically they were very good. What was pleasing tonight is that you might see games like that before where there is a bit of showboating because you are comfortable but we played like a proper team and we stayed focused.\n\nSouthampton 0-9 Leicester City: Premier League \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in games with Liverpool where we were 5-0 up against Arsenal in 50 minutes and 6-0 at Newcastle away from home. The message at half-time when it was 5-0 was to see it as 0-0 and go out and show we\u2019re a really, really good side by pushing and showing a hungry mentality.\n\n\u201cTo go out and do what we did and show that ruthless streak, it shows we\u2019re making steps to being a ruthless side. I think we\u2019ll get better, we will improve. Of course, the result and performance is perfect. But the players trust and believe in how we work. And we have young players who are only going to gain even more confidence. We will get better. We certainly won\u2019t just be content with what we\u2019re doing.\u201d", "description": "Southampton manager Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said he took 100% responsibility after his side were thrashed 9-0 by Leicester at St Mary\u2019s, the heaviest home defeat in top-flight history", "authors": ["Ben Fisher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81ba0b2df168dd195d5a102f23d604e48c5c6ab3/0_58_3211_1927/master/3211.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7f810edc8557925804112df3d7c18a68", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
