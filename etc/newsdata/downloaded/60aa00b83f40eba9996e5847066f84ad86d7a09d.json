Pretty much the first thing Junior Firpo did as a Bar\u00e7a player was miss the ball. The second was to fall flat on his face. He had been on the pitch for 54 seconds and as he lay on the grass, the soundtrack provided by a bloke with a swanee whistle and a set of cymbals, he watched the men in red and white run beyond him and a familiar scene unfold. It was happening again, only faster. At Athletic Bilbao on the opening night, Barcelona had gone behind in the 89th minute; against Betis a week later, it was the seventeenth; and at Osasuna, the sixth.\n\nThis time, in week five at Granada, they\u2019d only just made it to the second when Ramon Azeez scored. This time, they wouldn\u2019t make it out of trouble. As for Junior, signed from Real Betis for \u20ac18m in the summer, he didn\u2019t make it out for the second half. Lionel Messi did, at last making his league debut, and so did Ansu Fati, their hope at 16. Even they couldn\u2019t salvage anything from this wreckage. Arturo Vidal came on too. Pretty much the first thing he did was boot the ball off. The second was stick a hand out in the area. From the penalty spot, \u00c1lvaro Vadillo made it 2-0. It was all over. And, it was tempting to conclude, even this early, all might actually mean all. Barcelona had been beaten. Barcelona are beaten, it seems.\n\nMarcus Thuram\u2019s derby double lifts Gladbach from European humiliation | Andy Brassell Read more\n\nOn the night when Granada, with a budget that couldn\u2019t pay Messi let alone everyone else at the Camp Nou, their salary cap 18 times lower than Barcelona\u2019s, deservedly won 2-0, the story should have been about them. What they had done was, in their manager\u2019s too-literally-translated words, \u201cbarbaric.\u201d It should have been about how 11 of their players on Saturday were in the second division while Barcelona won the league last season. About how they have lost just once, against Sevilla on their first home game back in primera, and won three in a row since without conceding. It should have been about how victory momentarily took them top. Granada. Top. But it wasn\u2019t. And not just because Diego Mart\u00ednez, their manager, insisted that looking at the league was a \u201cwaste of time.\u201d Or even because the story almost never is about them when it can be about them.\n\nIt was because there was something about the way Barcelona were defeated, the way it managed to shock and not shock at all, that ran deeper. This wasn\u2019t just one game, and certainly wasn\u2019t just two men \u2013 still less Junior or Vidal, or even just Ernesto Valverde \u2013 however bad it had been. And, boy, had it been bad. It was difficult to remember a performance worse than this, and yet there was no lack of contenders.\n\nThis was sudden; it was also a long time coming. Dreadful in defence, in midfield, up front. Nothing worked. \u201cNot even with Messi,\u201d ran the cover of AS, and there was something telling in that too. On Friday morning, El Mundo Deportivo gleefully splashed on Real Madrid in crisis. By the following night, it was Barcelona who were. And by the night after, Madrid were top.\n\n\u201cThis Barcelona lies in ruins,\u201d AS\u2019s headline ran. \u201cAnother disaster,\u201d El Mundo Deportivo said. At the end, Frenkie De Jong approached the fans and apologised. He must have wondered where he had ended up. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. \u201cFor Barcelona, every stadium is Anfield now,\u201d wrote Santi Gim\u00e9nez. \u201cThey are a drama of epic proportions, where anyone can strip them bare with startling ease.\u201d Something broke that night. Or maybe it\u2019s more accurate to suggest that something was revealed, and has not been remedied..\n\nThey carried on regardless, reluctant to challenge the old order. But once it had happened it was more likely to happen again, a recurring nightmare. Rome resurfaced in Liverpool, and Liverpool resurfaces anywhere: Bilbao, Pamplona, Granada, Dortmund. The Camp Nou is one thing but Barcelona haven\u2019t won away since April. \u201cI am responsible,\u201d Valverde said. He meant for Saturday night but there\u2019s more. It is early, but it is their worst start in 25 years, and for all the coincidences \u2013 injuries, penalties, daft individual mistakes \u2013 it isn\u2019t entirely coincidental. They\u2019ve trailed in four of their five games and conceded in all of them. No one in La Liga has concededmore goals.\n\nSign up to The Fiver email Read more\n\nAnd this is more than that old, facile line about how Barcelona can\u2019t defend: they can\u2019t attack either. At Granada, they had one shot on target. Sure, they have been without Messi, Su\u00e1rez, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Neymar too, but it\u2019s not about that either; it\u2019s about the most basic thing of all, the essence of Barcelona, perhaps hidden behind Messi for too long: the play. Against Liverpool, there was something deeper than defeat. That this is a team losing its religion is an old debate, politicised and exaggerated: Barcelona have been the best team in Spain by miles over the last two years. For all the flaws, Anfield remains hard to explain. Nor were they as heretical, as un-Bar\u00e7a as some accusations had it. But there is something in it, in the lack of a structure, an idea, a commitment to an identity.\n\nIt has been hard to avoid the feeling that too few of those that mattered, manager included, believed in the model.. Slowly, football slipped from them. Xavi and Iniesta have gone. Messi is too often the team \u2013 a process in which he may not be entirely blameless \u2013 and one day, he will be gone too. That has created a kind of desperation. After the defeat in Liverpool, Valverde\u2019s time appeared to have come to a close, but it didn\u2019t. It is hard to see how you can recover from a moment like that. There\u2019s a feeling this is a season too far \u2013 two seasons too far, some critics insist. There are parallels to Guardiola\u2019s fourth season and Luis Enrique\u2019s third. Defeat brought opportunity, a chance to reset.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barcelona\u2019s Antoine Griezmann has received a frosty welcome from some team-mates since arriving from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Photograph: Jorge Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut they carried on; Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president, backed Valverde and some players did too: they were comfortable. Too comfortable. Valverde stands accused of allowing it. The decline went largely unchallenged. It is not that Barcelona are bad so much as that they\u2019re nothing in particular. De Jong came, someone to reinforce the model, but not always in his place: he has played too wide ornot at all. The men alongside him have changed. There have been five different line-ups in six weeks.\n\nAntoine Griezmann arrived, a year late. He has two positions: one is Messi\u2019s, the other is Su\u00e1rez\u2019s. The welcome was cold; those two wanted Neymar instead. Barcelona pursued the Brazilian publicly, driven by the president. They didn\u2019t sign him, but he cost them. The players who wanted him weren\u2019t happy, Messi among them, and the players that didn\u2019t weren\u2019t either. Asked how sick of it he was on a scale of one to 10 , Valverde said 9.5.\n\nBarcelona offered PSG players in part-exchange, but didn\u2019t tell the players that. One was Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, another was Philippe Coutinho before he was loaned to Bayern Munich in a desperate effort to . The attempt to sell the players they bought to replace Neymar, at a cost greater than his, to buy the Brazilian back again was the perfect portrait of the whole sorry story..\n\nThe sporting directors have rotated as much as the players, the latest happily heading off to Paris to chase a player he couldn\u2019t get. Meanwhile, the players flew east then west, preseason trumping the actual season. Then they came back and lost in Bilbao, which turned out to be just the start,Firpo fell down within a minute on his debut. The rest of them had been falling for far longer. \u201cWe have a long, hard season ahead of us,\u201d Luis Su\u00e1rez said on Saturday night, and he meant it.\n\nQuick guide La Liga results Show Hide Osasuna 0-0 Real Betis; Villarreal 2-0 Valladolid; Levante 0-0 Eibar; Atl\u00e9tico 0-0 Celta; Granada 2-0 Barcelona; Getafe 4-2 Mallorca; Espanyol 1-3 Real Sociedad; Valencia 1-1 Legan\u00e9s;\n\nAthletic Bilbao 2-0 Alav\u00e9s; Sevilla 0-1 Real Madrid\n\nTalking points\n\nInter\u2019s perfect start is flattering but they are in better shape than Milan | Nicky Bandini Read more\n\n\u2022 Zinedine Zidane did something even he hadn\u2019t done before: he took Real Madrid to the S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n and won. The last time they won 1-0 there, he was playing. It wasn\u2019t sparkling, but it didn\u2019t have to be; they just needed the victory and Zidane, under pressure, needed it most of all. \u201cA lot\u2019s been said,\u201d the Frenchman noted. Now it was his turn and he kept returning to the same word: solidaridad. Whether it will work elsewhere is a different matter. As Jorge Valdano put it last night: \u201cWhat Madrid did today they can\u2019t keep doing: Hazard, Bale and James will have to go forward, not defend at the back.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cAgua, agua.\u201d Kieran Trippier needed a drink, so someone in the south end threw him a bottle. He took a swig and threw it back. A thumbs up and there was applause. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s fans have really taken to him. Trippier has provided more deliveries into the box than anyone else in the Atl\u00e9tico side, but this time it was not enough: they couldn\u2019t find a way past Celta.\n\n\u2022 \u201cPeter Lim, go home\u201d read the banner at Mestalla, where a 1-1 draw was played out to protests against the owner. At one point, fans chanted the name of sacked manager Marcelino. Rodrigo wagged his finger; he loved Marcelino more than anyone, but now was the time to get behind the new coach, he explained afterwards. When the supporters chanted his name instead, he applauded.\n\n\u2022 Athletic are top for the first time since the opening day of 2005-06.
