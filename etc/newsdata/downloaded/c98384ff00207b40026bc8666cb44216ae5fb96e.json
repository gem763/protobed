on Earth behind us and start afresh in space?\n\nThe evangelists of Asgardia, the \u2018first space nation\u2019, believe that the problems of Earth should not be replicated in space when, they believe, people start moving there.\n\n\u2018It would be dangerous to take with us the huge baggage of problems accumulated over millennia,\u2019 says Igor Ashurbeyli, the founder and head of nations of Asgardia.\n\nHe hopes to lay the political and legal foundations for a new type of nation, one that \u2018sees no borders\u2019.\n\nSince its formation in 2016, Asgardia now boasts a constitution and a parliament that serves almost 20,000 citizens around the world.\n\nIn exchange for \u20ac100 (\u00a386), citizens receive a handful of Solar \u2013 Asgardia\u2019s own cryptocurrency \u2013 and the opportunity to upload their photo to a small satellite that orbits the Earth.\n\nThey can even sing Asgardia\u2019s national anthem, which is as earnest as the national anthems of most Earth-bound nations.\n\nThe concept art for Asgardia is quite something (Picture: James Vaughan/Asgardia) The concept art for Asgardia is quite something (Picture: James Vaughan/Asgardia) (Picture: James

President George W Bush\u2019s Vision For Space Exploration, that a permanent research station on the moon would be in place by 2020.\n\nUnless something dramatic happens in the next 14 months, that will not happen.\n\nBut of course, Ashurbeyli, who almost entire funds Asgardia, is not the only billionaire with space ambitions.\n\nOn the technology front, Elon Musk\u2019s company SpaceX and Jeff Bezos\u2019 company Blue Origin have made the most progress towards creating a society in space.\n\nSo what makes Asgardia any different?\n\n\u2018Unlike Elon Musk, we don\u2019t aspire to place one million people on Mars, Ashurbeyli tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018Until we can get a child to be born in space, no such mission makes sense because the people who go on those missions will never return.\u2019\n\nAshurbeyli also notes the \u2018discrimination\u2019 that runs through most efforts to colonise space.\n\n\u2018Only about 20 countries out of 229 have access,\u2019 he says, describing national space agencies as \u2018selfish\u2019.\n\nDemocratising access to space is one of Asgardia\u2019s chief goals, alongside the preservation and expansion of humanity.\n\n\u2018The idea that the human race is going to sit at home watching daytime TV for the rest of eternity when there\u2019s an entire universe inviting us to visit is ridiculous,\u2019 says Lembit \u00d6pik, the chairman of Asgardia\u2019s parliament, former Liberal Democrat MP and sometimes daytime TV guest.\n\nBut first they must figure out how to give birth to an Asgardian in space, which Ashurbeyli predicts will happen by 2041.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are many unknowns and concerns when doing this.\n\nThe Space Life Origin project in the Netherlands wanted to send a pregnant woman 250 miles above Earth to give birth in 2024 as a world \u2013 or near space \u2013 first.\n\nIt is currently indefinitely suspended because of \u2018serious ethical, safety and medical concerns\u2019 and \u2018not realistic\u2019 to fund.\n\nFor Asgardia, the effects of cancer-causing cosmic rays on astronauts are still largely unknown and would make giving birth and raising a child in space especially hazardous.\n\nThe differences in gravity on a spacecraft or off-world colony throw up other unknowns and risks and could mean infants grow into quite different bodies.\n\nNo expert can say with confidence the impact that being born in space or an artificial environment could have on a baby.\n\n\u2018You could be a kind of Superman,\u2019 says \u00d6pik.\n\n\u2018That was the whole idea of Superman. He came from a planet which had far higher gravity than the Earth.\u2019\n\nSpeaking at Asgardia\u2019s first Space Science and Investment Congress last week, neuroscientist Jeffrey Alberts says that people born in space could even have different brains to those on Earth, with some senses heightened and others diminished.\n\nCalling this difference the \u2018astroneurone\u2019, he warned that space-born humans could be seen as deficient but encouraged such adaptations to be appreciated as part of humanity\u2019s incredible diversity.\n\nWith the possibility of a space birth looming in the coming decades, Asgardia wants to create a new political and legal framework not tied to any Earth nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018What would it mean to be born on the moon and then be told that you\u2019re American?,\u2019 says \u00d6pik.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019\n\nSuch space societies are a mainstay of science fiction, from the pioneering spaceship designs of Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in the 19th century, to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s visionary 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nAsgardia\u2019s depiction of a fleet of Space Arks that would orbit the Earth to ensure the survival of humanity is equally ambitious and still in the realm of science fiction.\n\nSo is the Space Nation just another billionaire\u2019s vanity project?\n\n\u2018The amount of time and energy that you have to invest and the scope of problems you might have to overcome to open your own shoe store is equivalent to many significantly more ambitious projects,\u2019 Ashurbeyli tells Metro.co.uk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018You only have 24 hours in each day and only two hands. So I thought what could be the most ambitious project to deal with?\u2019\n\nAsgardia\u2019s Constitution does give a few more concrete examples of what Asgardian society would look like.\n\nPolitical parties and public religion are banned in Asgardia, which Ashurbeyli hopes will lead to a peaceful society free from the conflicts of Earth.\n\nIt\u2019s a utopian, but a potentially autocratic blueprint for future civilisation. Critics also question the diversity of future space societies like Asgardia.\n\nAround 80% of Asgardians are men and the leading ranks of Asgardia\u2019s Parliament could be described as largely pale, male and stale.\n\nStill, \u00d6pik paints an optimistic picture of what life in space would be like:\n\n\u2018In many ways, it\u2019ll be like life on Earth,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018People will have arguments, they\u2019ll fall in love, they\u2019ll fall out of love, they\u2019ll have children.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ll look out the window and amazing views and sometimes they\u2019ll complain about the space weather.\u2019\n\nFacing deadly solar winds, and a distinct lack of rain \u2013 except for the occasional meteor shower \u2013 there would be plenty to complain about.\n\nAnd the demands of sustaining life in such a hostile environment makes raising children especially challenging for any prospective space-parents:\n\nWhat is Asgardia? One of the first Asgardian projects will be the creation of a network of satellites to protect the Earth from space hazards such as asteroids, solar flares and orbiting man-made debris. Asgardia is named after the City of the Gods in Norse mythology. Its main aim is to develop space technology unfettered by Earthly politics and laws, leading ultimately to a permanent orbiting home where its citizens can live and work. People can apply online to be Asgardian citizens via its website. Those already recognised as citizens are now being asked to vote on key elements of the Asgardian constitution. Asgardia-1, launched on November 12, 2017, was roughly the size of a loaf of bread, measuring just 20cm (eight inches) long and weighing about 2.3kg (5lbs). It contained a solid-state hard drive containing the citizen data of the first Asgardians and two particle detectors for measuring radiation levels in space.\n\n\u2018It takes two parents to have a child,\u2019 says \u00d6pik.\n\n\u2018Maybe it takes the whole planet to raise a child.\u2019\n\nAsgardia\u2019s democratic ideals will unlikely translate into an affordable ticket into space anytime soon.\n\n\u00d6pik acknowledges that virtual reality is a more practical near-term way for many Earth-bound Asgardians to travel to space.\n\nBut when people start experiencing the harsh realities of life in space, the more Earth-bound society may appreciate the oasis our planet provides.\n\n\u2018We are a tiny, tiny, tiny, little rock in an advanced universe, and it\u2019s the only spaceship that we have: it\u2019s Spaceship Earth,\u2019 Belgian astronaut Frank de Winne told an audience at Asgardia\u2019s Congress.\n\n\u2018We need to find solutions in space. But we need to make sure that when we do [venture into space] that we don\u2019t make the mistakes that we did in colonising our planet.\u2019\n\nWhat happens to our \u2018tiny little rock\u2019 in the next century is a fascinating question.\n\nLembit Opik and others think that moving to space could be a realistic proposition before the century is over.\n\nA Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist thinks that is a very stupid idea.\n\nThe Future Of Everything This piece is part of Metro.co.uk's series The Future Of Everything.
