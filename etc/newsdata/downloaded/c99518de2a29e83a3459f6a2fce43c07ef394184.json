It\u2019s because rather than impose his Bible-thumping religion, with its commandment \u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d on Trump, he has let Trump corrupt him. A glance at Trivago would reveal numerous hotels smack dab in the middle of where Pence\u2019s meetings were taking place, and yet when Trump said, according to Pence\u2019s chief of staff Marc Short, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay at my place?\u201d he said yes.\n\nWhen I invite someone to stay at my place, even if they chip the wedding china and drink all the good wine during their visit, I don\u2019t bill them. But what \u201cstaying at my place\u201d means when it\u2019s Trump doing the inviting is that the taxpayer will pay dearly\u2014likely six figures for the whole entourage (a suite with ocean view, high-count thread sheets, in-floor heat, and bespoke decor goes for $1,000 per night), and that\u2019s without the cost of the commute by helicopter, or the bar tab.\n\nThe defense that Mike Pompeo\u2019s State Department purportedly approved every last dollar of the trip is just confirmation that everyone\u2019s on the take.\n\nBy dipping into the U.S. Treasury, Pence has gone beyond lining Trump\u2019s pockets with $250,000 of his donors\u2019 money at Trump\u2019s DC hotel and steakhouse. Trump didn\u2019t select Pence to enrich himself\u2014he has others for that. It was to vouch for him with the Christian Right. The thrice-married casino boss needed a rock-ribbed, church going, once-married TV Dad with the hair God gave him for ballast among evangelicals.\n\nPence\u2019s signature achievement, in addition to his belief in praying away the gay, was driving Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act to passage. It wrote discrimination against LGBTQ citizens into law so there would be no question that a baker could refuse to put a groom and a groom atop a wedding cake.\n\nHis antipathy to gays is so pronounced that when he and Karen Pence, who teaches art at an anti-LGBTQ school, had lunch with the prime minister of Ireland and his partner, it made news when Pence\u2019s press wrangler tweeted it as proof Pence wasn\u2019t hostile to gays. It\u2019s proof of nothing, since not to do it would have created an international incident. A meal doesn\u2019t a tolerant person make.\n\nBefore lining Trump\u2019s coffers, Pence proved his worth many times over, even if it came at the expense of being a hypocrite and laughingstock. His first test was covering for candidate Trump after the Access Hollywood tape came out containing words the man who won\u2019t be alone with a woman not his wife (did you hear the one about the waiter removing Mrs. Butterworth\u2019s syrup from his table until Mrs. Pence arrived?) had never heard.\n\n\u201c Pence has now shown he will do more than placate religious conservatives for Trump. He will also cut a corner to enrich him. \u201d\n\nWhile on matters sexual Pence is true blue, he doesn\u2019t measure up on other concerns of the truly religious. He gives the hard-core evangelicals who believe in caring for the tired and hungry pause when he demurs over the propriety of \u201csend her back\u201d and separating children from their parents at the border. But he reassures them when he praises Trump\u2019s appointment of judges and tax cuts, and reminds them how much better everything is without Hillary Clinton as president.\n\nAfter Doonbeg, Pence may now join those vice presidents who started scandals, which is better than being grouped with Cheney, who started a war. Pence\u2019s prior public service was good training for being v.p., which comes with indignity built in.\n\nAs a congressman he introduced 90 bills and resolutions without one becoming law. As governor, he squandered former Gov. Mitch Daniels\u2019 great economy by forcing through the largest tax cuts and inevitable deficits in Indiana history. Had Trump not tapped him, he would likely have lost re-election.\n\nGrateful for the rescue, he\u2019s done everything Trump\u2019s asked. Pence cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as secretary of education so she could protect all those Trump University-like for-profit scams still standing. He speaks to everyone Trump desperately needs but can\u2019t be bothered with: the March for Life rally, the Susan B. Anthony dinner, and the Summit on Persecuted Christians.\n\nTrump\u2019s trust in Pence to do nothing is so complete that he put him in charge of his election integrity panel. He appointed him chair of the National Space Council, evidence that deep down every president might wish his vice president, a daily reminder of his own mortality, would join the first manned mission to Mars.\n\nScouring every speech of Pence\u2019s, there is only one memorable, out-of-character moment. Pence dispensed with his usual pat answer about his job when an American University student asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be the 48th vice president of the United States?\u201d He said the job requires you \u201cto keep your arms and legs in the ride at all times. Pull the roll bar down, because you just got to hang on.\u201d\n\nDo still waters run deep? One minute he\u2019s working everyday \u201cto advance the agenda of this president\u201d et cetera, et cetera, and then another he\u2019s boarding the Kingda Ka at Six Flags and holding on for dear life. He was only a ZIP code away from the Oval Office when he answered that AU student. There\u2019s been nothing like it since, yet it makes you wonder if, in the middle of the night, he\u2019s in on his own demise.\n\nWe\u2019re too beaten down to conjure up the uproar that would ensue if Barack Obama had sent his veep to a resort he owned in Hawaii for an administration event. Or to gasp when Attorney General William Barr just happens to choose Trump\u2019s Washington hotel for his Christmas party (for $30,000). Or stay horrified when Trump gives a three-minute infomercial at the G-7 to hold the next G-7 at his Doral resort. Already it\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news.\n\nFast forward to this week when, always the good soldier, Pence filled in for Trump in Poland at a World War II commemoration. Trump cancelled, blaming Hurricane Dorian, which he monitored, if at all, from his golf cart. He sent Alabamans scurrying for plywood and sandbags before the National Weather Service issued a correction that Dorian would not get that far inland. Always right, Trump insisted it would.\n\nSo far, Pence has not been asked to comment, but you can be sure he would agree that the Cotton State was in peril. And with Doonbeg, he\u2019s shown he will do more than placate religious conservatives for Trump. He will also cut a corner to enrich him. With that, in the pantheon of vice presidents, he\u2019s left the hapless league of Dan Quayle for the swamp of Spiro Agnew.", "description": "For two-plus years, the fawning vice president merely made a fool of himself.
