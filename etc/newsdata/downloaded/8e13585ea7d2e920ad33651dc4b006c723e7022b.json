I had met him first in a cemetery in the Kurdish capital Qamishli where he was burying one of his men who had been killed by an Isis rocket when driving a bulldozer to build field fortifications in the middle of a battle.\n\nBut now he and his men were learning new tactics to combat the Turkish military units that were beginning to mass on the Turkish side of the border.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Much of the Kurdish population lives in cities and towns like Qamishli, Kobani and Tal Abyad just south of the Syrian-Turkish frontier. They are unlikely to wait to see what a Turkish occupation, backed by bands of Syrian Arab paramilitaries with links to al-Qaeda type groups, is like.\n\nTrump\u2019s support for America\u2019s Kurdish allies was always rickety, but the brazenness of the final betrayal is still breathtaking. All the credit for defeating Isis is given to US forces under Trump\u2019s wise leadership, while in reality the US role was almost entirely confined to airstrikes and artillery fire.\n\nSpeaking of the Kurdish role as the military core of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the crucial battle for the Isis capital Raqqa, Brett McGurk, the former presidential envoy to the anti-Isis coalition, says on Twitter: \u201cThe SDF suffered thousands of casualties in the Raqqa battle. Not a single American life was lost.\u201d Overall, 11,000 Syrian Kurds were killed fighting Isis over the last five years.\n\nMcGurk denies that the Kurds ever received lavish supplies of military hardware from the US: \u201cThe weapons provided were meagre and just enough for the battle against Isis. (The SDF cleared IEDs by purchasing flocks of sheep.)\u201d\n\nSince 2015 I have been visiting Rojava watching the YPG soldiers advance west and south and always wondering what would happen when Isis was defeated and the US did not need them anymore. The Kurds, who are no political neophytes, wondered the same thing, but there was little they could do to change the direction of events, except hope that the US would not entirely let them down.\n\nIt seems that, in the event, their most pessimistic assumptions are being fulfilled, though \u2013 such is the nature of the Trump White House \u2013 the extent of American betrayal is unclear.\n\nThe most important feature by far of the US military presence in Syria is airpower and not the small number of troops on the ground. Will the US maintain an air umbrella over Rojava and, if so, does this mean that the Turks will not be able to deploy their air force against the YPG? If this is indeed the case, it would give the 25,000 battle-hardened YPG troops more of a military option, though, even so, their chances of long-term success are limited.\n\nIt is unclear how far the Turks will advance: their attack could at first be in a limited area between the towns of Tal-Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. But the White House statement spoke of Turkey taking responsibility for Isis prisoners, most of whom are in a camp at al-Hol that is deep inside Rojava, close to the Iraqi border. Taking over this would mean the Turks seizing much of northeast Syria.\n\nDo the Kurds have any political options? The only obvious one \u2013 supposing the Kurdish alliance with the US to be a broken reed \u2013 is to look to President Bashar al-Assad and to Russia. The Kurds do not like the Syrian government, which persecuted and marginalised them for years before 2011, but they do prefer them to Turkish control and probable expulsion.\n\nThe problem here is that the Kurds may have left it too late. So long as they were allied to the US, they could not seriously negotiate with Damascus. Now they appear to have the worst of all possible worlds: neither Washington nor Moscow nor Damascus is going to protect them.\n\nBut the options were never quite as simple as that: the Syrian army has never been strong enough to fight Turkey. Presidents Putin and Assad do not want a Turkish invasion but they will also be glad to see the back of the American forces.\n\nThe de facto Kurdish state of Rojava could swiftly disintegrate under the impact of a Turkish incursion. A scramble for its territory is already beginning: Syrian and Turkish army units are reportedly racing each other to take over the Arab city of Manbij just west of the Euphrates that has been under effective Kurdish control. A new chaotic phase in the Syrian war is beginning.", "description": "In a field beside a disused railway station on the plain just south of the Syrian-Turkish frontier, a brigade of Syrian Kurdish soldiers were retraining in order to resist an invasion by the Turkish army. \u201cWe acted like a regular army when we were fighting Daesh [Isis],\u201d Rojvan, a veteran Kurdish commander of the YPG (People\u2019s Protection Units), told me. \u201cBut now it is we who", "authors": ["Patrick Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/28/16/ypg-troops-manbij-syria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
