Wishing you every success in your endeavours.\"\n\nSolskjaer, meanwhile, has urged players and fans to trust in his long-term version despite the club winning just two of their opening six Premier League fixtures.\n\n\"I never said it was going to be easy this season, I've said it many times. There will be ups and downs and highs and lows.\n\n\"When we lose a game and go through difficult periods it's time for us to trust ourselves and trust what we're doing and keep our eyes on the prize, and keep working to the principles that we believe in.\n\n\"It's not changing direction every game you lose. Every game in the Premier League is winnable but also losable, it's fine margins.\n\n\"You listen to the crowd at Old Trafford, they're amazing. Now is the time to keep supporting us because we are going through a leaner patch, both trophy-wise in the last few years and now with results in the last few games.\"", "description": "Manchester United have confirmed the sudden departure of goalkeeping coach, Emilio Alvarez.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/w_wP_nxt46QkQ2jJTqwUdA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M6IPkUweZopKqHEAv3LSHw--~B/aD0xNTMxO3c9MjQ0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/7ef1a32abe09acc5149ccdbd109d9143", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
