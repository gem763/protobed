Before a crowd announced at 14,142, he allowed one run and four hits in six innings during his first major league start since Aug. 7.\n\n\u201cTyler has pitched pretty well for us, both as a starter and a reliever, and he really pulled everything together,\u201d Gardenhire said.\n\nJoe Jim\u00e9nez retired the first two batters in the ninth before the Orioles loaded the bases on three singles. Trey Mancini, who hit his third homer of the series in the sixth inning, struck out on three pitches.\n\n\u201cThat was terrible,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cI felt really good about my series, and then I end it by chasing two bad pitches in a key situation. I was clearly trying to do too much.\u201d\n\nJohn Means (10-11) gave up five runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings.\n\n\u201cThey were aggressive, and they had a pretty good game plan,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in attack mode, but they were able to do damage.\u201d\n\nDetroit led 2-0 after its first two batters. Victor Reyes tripled over center fielder Austin Hays, and Jordy Mercer hit the next pitch into the Baltimore bullpen in left-center for his ninth homer. Reyes made it 4-0 with a two-out, two-run double in the fifth, and Dawel Lugo hit a sacrifice fly in the sixth.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m a brilliant manager, because I got our two hottest hitters - Victor and Jordy - up in big situations,\u201d Gardenhire said. \u201cI wish I had been doing that all season.\u201d\n\nBaltimore struggled against Alexander, who pitched the first five innings in under an hour.\n\n\u201cHe threw the ball really well, but we made it easy for him,\u201d Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t getting him deep into counts.\u201d\n\nJonathan Villar led off the seventh with a triple off Jos\u00e9 Cisnero and scored on Hays\u2019 single.\n\nBuck Farmer, dealing with a racing heartbeat, threw two fastballs up and in to Renato N\u00fa\u00f1ez in the eighth inning, hitting him on a hand on the second one.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez yelled at Farmer in anger before going to first base for treatment from the training staff. Orioles reliever then hit Jeimer Candelario with the first pitch of the Tigers eighth, leading plate umpire Roberto Ortiz to warn both benches.\n\n\u201cThat was absurd,\u201d Gardenhire said. \u201cBuck had to come out of the game because of his heart rate, and he certainly wasn\u2019t trying to hit anyone with two out and two strikes. \u2026 Then they hit our guy, which was silly, and the umpire warned the dugouts, which was silly.\u201d\n\nRARE FEAT\n\nOrioles LF Stevie Wilkerson and RF Anthony Santander recorded an assist on the same play in the fifth inning. Reyes overran second on his two-run double, hoping to draw a throw that would ensure a second run scored. Wilkerson\u2019s throw was on target, but Reyes stayed in the rundown long enough that Santander ended up coming in from right to take part in a 7-6-3-5-9-3-4 putout.\n\n\u201cI wanted to keep going so they would throw and make sure we got two runs,\u201d Reyes said, through an interpreter. \u201cI stayed alive for a while - I\u2019ve been working hard on my baserunning.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nOrioles: DH Mark Trumbo was a late scratch from the Baltimore lineup because of a trapezius strain. . X-rays on N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s hand were negative.\n\nTigers: DH Miguel Cabrera returned to the lineup after a flareup in his right knee forced him to leave Saturday\u2019s game early and sit out on Sunday. . Farmer\u2019s heart was checked after he left the game, but Gardenhire said he was fine.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOrioles: Baltimore starts a three-game series Tuesday against visiting Toronto, which starts RHP Trent Thornton (5-9, 5.04).\n\nTigers: Detroit heads across Lake Erie for three games against the Indians, who are 15-1 against the Tigers this season. With Matthew Boyd away from the team due to a family emergency, Detroit will use its bullpen Tuesday against RHP Adam Plutko (6-4).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There was only one fitting way for a four-game series between the major leagues' worst teams to end - with no one winning.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Hogg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/orioles_tigers_baseball_81126_c0-97-2310-1443_s1770x1032.jpg?faa56729c4b2bffa74fd47c5c302e7033da3d618", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
