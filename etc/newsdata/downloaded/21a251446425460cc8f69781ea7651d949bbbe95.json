Many older adults we speak to feel stuck in their homes because they're not able to navigate their local pavements.\n\n\"People continue to be put at risk of injury and isolation with every day of inaction that passes.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @HuwMerriman To those who feel this is heavy-handed, try telling that to the 19 year old who came to visit me in her wheelchair to ask for help. This has worked in London since 1974 with exemptions to park on kerb where sensible. It can work for rest of England. https://t.co/5tQ31SPVny \u2014 Huw Merriman (@HuwMerriman) September 9, 2019 Report\n\nA Department for Transport spokeswoman said: \"We are committed to ensuring that our roads work for everyone, but are aware that pavement parking can cause real problems for a variety of road users.\n\n\"This is why the department recently concluded a review to better understand the case for changing the law, and will be announcing our next steps over the coming months.\"", "description": "The Transport Committee says blocking paths has a big impact, including on people with disabilities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/76B2/production/_108668303_gettyimages-461479642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
