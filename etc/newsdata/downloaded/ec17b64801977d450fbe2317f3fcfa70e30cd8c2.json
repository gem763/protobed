The stock touched a more than 5-1/2 month high earlier in the session.\n\nShares in Philip Morris surged 6.1% after the tobacco company called off merger talks with Altria Group Inc and said it would instead focus on the U.S. launch of its tobacco-heating product, iQOS.\n\nThe trade-sensitive Philadelphia chip index gained 0.70%, while the broader technology sector rose 0.45%.\n\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were in the black, with the defensive utilities, real estate and healthcare sectors on the back foot.\n\n\"I don't think the impeachment issue is weighing on markets, or will weigh on markets (in the near term) ... However, if it eventually results in gridlock in Washington, then that certainly could concern investors and we could see that being reflected in stock prices,\" Cornerstone Capital's Geraghty added.\n\nAt 13:09 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 149.81 points, or 0.56%, at 26,957.58 and the S&P 500 was up 9.26 points, or 0.31%, at 2,975.86. The Nasdaq Composite was up 34.94 points, or 0.44%, at 8,028.57.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp rose 7.7% and was among the top gainers on the S&P 500 after activist investor Elliott Management renewed its demand for splitting the company into three.\n\nChipmaker Broadcom Inc dropped 3.3% and was the biggest loser on the S&P 500 after it priced an upsized offering of convertible preferred stock.\n\nData showed that sales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded more than expected in August, a sign that the struggling housing market was starting to get a lift from lower borrowing rates.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.35-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 5 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 17 new highs and 90 new lows.
