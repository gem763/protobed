Half were assigned to take the combo pill. The others continued their usual care.\n\nAfter a year, the polypill patients had lowered their blood pressure and LDL, or bad cholesterol, by more than the others and by amounts doctors find meaningful.\n\nThe study didn\u2019t last long enough to measure heart attacks or strokes. A five-year study of a different polypill, in 6,800 people in Iran, found it lowered the danger of heart attack, stroke or heart failure by a third.\n\nPolypills aren\u2019t yet available in the United States. Many U.S. doctors have seen little need, preferring to tailor medications individually, said Dr. Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Canada, who leads another polypill study expected to finish next year.\n\nBut doctors often fail to customize medications because they don\u2019t have time and patients dislike return visits.\n\n\u201cThat just doesn\u2019t happen in practice,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nThe research , paid for by the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health, was published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the type of evidence we need that will help move this strategy forward,\u201d said Dr. Sidney Smith, a former heart association president from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nMost of the people in the study made less than $15,000 a year and 96% were black. They had at least borderline high blood pressure. People were excluded if their \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol was too high, which would require more aggressive treatment.\n\nDespite having elevated blood pressure, only about half were on medication for it and less than 20% were on cholesterol medicine.\n\n\u201cThe polypill gives vulnerable patients a running start\u201d toward better health, said lead author Dr. Daniel Mu\u00f1oz, a heart doctor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nVanderbilt made the pills at a monthly cost of $26 per patient, though the drugs were free to study participants.\n\nCharles Roland, 66, of Prichard, Alabama, took the polypill. Remembering one pill was easier than his prior routine of a blood pressure pill in the morning and a cholesterol pill in the evening.\n\n\u201cMy blood pressure went way down,\u201d Roland said of his results during the study. \u201cMy cholesterol went down and maintained at a consistent level that\u2019s not a threat to my health.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Carla K.
