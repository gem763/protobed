The next alternative, Efrafa, is a totalitarian prison house: Instead of surrendering an essential rabbitness for the sake of ease and safety, Efrafa\u2019s dictator, the terrifying and omnicompetent General Woundwort, deals with the enmity of men and predators by running a police state, one that keeps its rabbits underground and regimented, trains the strongest bucks to fight and rule and dominate, denies any agency to the warren\u2019s females, and refuses diplomacy and cooperation with fellow rabbits as much as with any other creature. The rabbit heroes first approach Efrafa seeking to recruit does, to enable their fledgling warren to survive; by the end of the book, they\u2019re engaged in a death struggle with Woundwort that requires all their own political virtues to survive.\n\nThose virtues are distributed among different rabbits: Along with Fiver\u2019s prophet, there is the statesman-leader Hazel; the soldier-fighter Bigwig; the thinker-inventor Blackberry; the storyteller Dandelion; and more. And what makes the regime the rabbits are founding good \u2014 and successful, but first and foremost good \u2014 is the integration of the different virtues, the cooperation of their different embodiments, their willing subordination to one another as circumstances require.\n\nThe military hero, Bigwig, could have been a Woundwort in a different dispensation; instead he willingly bends to the statesman, Hazel, who lacks his strength and fearlessness but exceeds him in foresight and guile. Hazel in turn defers to Fiver\u2019s gift of prophecy, his religious genius, which is why the band escapes disaster in the first place (their original warren\u2019s leader is a talented statesman, but fatally dismissive of the religious and mystical) and why it ultimately succeeds in founding and sustaining a new regime.\n\nMeanwhile, the other virtues \u2014 invention, lore keeping, even comedy \u2014 play supporting roles as needed, and nobody claims the wrong sort of authority. (The keenest intellect, for instance, neither aspires to nor is vested with the greatest power; note well, meritocrats.) Out of this collaboration a regime emerges that is rebuke to both the grim alternatives, with a mixture of hierarchy and liberty that works with the grain of rabbitness instead of seeking a corrupt comfort or an impossible level of security.\n\n[Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]\n\nThe spoilers are over; now let\u2019s return to the late-modern liberal world, and consider our own discontents in the light of the contrast that Adams draws between his newly founded warren and its rivals.\n\nSomewhere near the root of those discontents is a fear that the kind of balanced and virtuous society \u2014 simultaneously mystical and practical, orderly and free \u2014 that the rabbits build in \u201cWatership Down\u201d has slipped somehow from our grasp, or else was always just a myth. In which case we are left to choose between its darker rivals, between a comfortable decadence in which virtue erodes and the reaper beckons, or else some variant on Efrafa\u2019s totalitarian alternative.", "description": "A classic novel (yes, the one about rabbits) has a political teaching for today.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/opinion/22douthat3/22douthat3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
