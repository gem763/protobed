USA TODAY\n\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Psst \u2026 looking for a great deal on a smartwatch? Then, this may turn out to be just the season.\n\nIndeed, the theme for this year\u2019s crop of full-featured wearables is less about driving new capabilities, as it was last year, and more about packing the latest technology into lower price points. Apple did introduce the Apple Watch Series 5 at its traditional premium price points of $399 and $499. But in announcing the Series 5, the market leader also acknowledged the growing value segment by dropping the price of the Series 3 watch to $199 for the GPS version and $299 for cellular.\n\nFitbit and Samsung, the next two largest smartwatch suppliers in the U.S., both stood pat on their premium lines and instead targeted mainstream price points with new products: Fitbit\u2019s Versa 2 at $199, and the $299 Active2 from Samsung.\n\nAll of this is not only good news for your wallet today. It\u2019s also a sign that the parade of new technology is slowing, which means you won\u2019t feel like the watch you bought this season will be obsolete the next.\n\nA wristful of watches, left to right: Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2, Fitbit Versa 2, Apple Watch Series 5, Fossil Gen 5. (Photo: Mike Feibus)\n\nI\u2019ve been evaluating all three suppliers\u2019 newest devices, as well as the Gen 5 Carlyle from Fossil, Google\u2019s leading partner on the Wear OS, priced at $295.\n\nHere\u2019s my take:\n\nApple Watch Series 5\n\nThe Series 5 is certainly a handsome, compelling smartwatch. That said, the enhancements over the Series 4 pale in comparison to the leap last year\u2019s model made over the Series 3. Which probably explains why Apple maintained the Series 3 as its entry-level option and pulled the Series 4.\n\nOne nice thing: Although the Series 5 maintains the brand\u2019s signature soft-rectangular styling, it\u2019s never been easier to pick out the new Watch from a wrist in a lineup. Thank the new always-on display for that.\n\nThe always-on feature also sets the Series 5 apart from the smartwatches reviewed here. It displays a white-on-mostly-black version of the watch face you\u2019ve selected and is even readable in the bright Arizona sun. The others all have an always-on option as well. But they offer either similar outdoor viewability or watch-face flexibility, but not both.\n\nApple Watch Series 5 is the first Apple Watch to offer an \u201calways on\u201d Retina display \u2013 without it impacting the battery. (Photo: 2019 Apple Inc. All Rights Reserved.)\n\nThe company added two more hardware features. One is an integrated compass. It works well and would no doubt come in handy for in-the-wild activities like off-the-path hiking.\n\nThe other is international emergency calling, a no-borders extension of the SOS feature from earlier Watches. That, along with fall detection and built-in ECG from the Series 4, is helping appeal to older consumers who haven\u2019t shown as much interest in smartwatches as younger buyers.\n\nAs with all Apple Watches, the Series 5 is elegant, capable and user-friendly. Notifications, for example, often pull more media and formatting from the original phone alert than the others. Like my CBS Sports alerts, which display accompanying photos on the Apple Watch but not the other devices.\n\nSleeping on the job? New Apple Watch, but still no sleep tracking\n\nThe Health app is incorporating a few metrics others already offer, like high and low heart rate and resting heart rate \u2013 which I find to be particularly valuable for gauging fitness levels over time. And of course, Apple is still alone in offering apps with irregular heartrate detection and companion ECG.\n\nCertainly, Apple is a leader in the health space in many ways. Which is why it\u2019s so surprising that neither Apple nor third-party developers have advanced sleep-quality assessment beyond motion detection. To add more advanced quality metrics, Apple would need to incorporate heart rate. It\u2019s not for lack of quality sensing.\n\nI suspect it has more to do with battery life, which is on par with previous generations at 18 hours. Samsung and Fitbit didn\u2019t start to incorporate more sophisticated sleep tracking until they began offering smartwatches with multi-day battery life one and two years ago, respectively. Maybe the same will happen soon at Apple.\n\nFitbit Versa 2\n\nThough Fitbit is a pioneer in the fitness tracker space, it\u2019s a relative newcomer to smartwatches, introducing its first just two years ago. That product, the Fitbit Ionic, is still available, for $249.\n\nRather than refreshing the Ionic, Fitbit has since followed with more mainstream products at the $199 price point: the Versa in 2018, and, this season, the Versa 2. With the Versa 2, the company also cut the price of the Versa Lite, a lower-cost spinoff of the original, to $159.\n\nYou can read my full review of the Versa 2, but briefly: It\u2019s a compelling follow-on, with a much-improved screen and even better battery life. It draws from Fitbit\u2019s heritage in fitness tracking and, as such, is still the best at offering detail and insight into exercise, fitness and sleep. I find Fitbit\u2019s new Sleep Score feature to be a compelling enhancement.\n\nThat said, the health gap between Fitbit and the others is closing. Samsung has made great strides and Apple, as mentioned, is also forging ahead.\n\nBefore Apple Watch, there was Fitbit: A decade of tracking our steps\n\nWhat makes Fitbit increasingly vulnerable is that, with its fitness edge slimming, it\u2019s not keeping up with the smartwatch-first suppliers on, you know, the smartwatch stuff.\n\nHow CBS Sports looks on the Fitbit (Photo: Mike Feibus)\n\nThe Versa 2, for example, is now the only device in the price range without a built-in speaker or GPS. Fitbit did integrate Amazon\u2019s Alexa, and added a microphone interface. The microphone is off by default, so you must press and hold the side button to activate. I view that more as a feature than a bug, for privacy's sake. And the lack of a speaker doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m content to read Alexa\u2019s responses on the display \u2013 especially in crowded areas.\n\nOther smartphone-style efforts are similarly lacking. The new Spotify app, for example, is little more than a play/pause/forward/rewind remote. The Spotify apps on the other three smartwatches all offer far more.\n\nAnd while the always-on screen is viewable outdoors, the Versa 2 displays little more than the time. And the only way to wake the watch is to press the side button.\n\nAesthetically, calendar alerts, call notifications and other flags on the Versa 2 are the weakest of the group. In stark contrast to the Apple Watch\u2019s pristine alerts, for example, the CBS Sports updates often truncate the score, so I usually see only the visiting team\u2019s score, as it\u2019s listed first.\n\nIf your primary interest is health, fitness and sleep, then all of this is small change. The Versa 2 is worth your attention.\n\nFossil Gen 5\n\nThe Fossil Gen 5 \u2013 particularly the Carlyle model with the stainless-steel band I was sent for evaluation \u2013 is without a doubt a masculine watch.\n\nIt\u2019s weighty and formidable. Like a real watch. The screen is also handsome. The interface is clean and friendly. Navigation is straightforward. Notifications are attractive. The Gen 5 works well. Which is saying something for Wear OS by Google watches.\n\nHow CBS Sports appears on the Fossil Gen 5 smartwatch (Photo: Mike Feibus)\n\nBut I\u2019ve found the watch to be equal parts frustrating and satisfying. The display is the faintest of the watches here. During initial setup, in fact, the screen was so dim I could barely read the prompts. I suspect that has something to do with managing battery life, which consistently was the poorest of the bunch. Sometimes the Carlyle lasted just 12 hours. It never stretched beyond 20.\n\nThere are other battery-sparing tricks employed. The watch only samples heart rate once every 20 minutes, for example, unless you\u2019re exercising. And it doesn\u2019t monitor sleep using heart rate, only motion. At least, I couldn\u2019t find an app that uses heart rate for sleep.\n\nSo, apps. If you assumed an open smartwatch platform with multiple hardware vendors would boast one of the richest suites of apps, well, you know what happens when you assume. The Wear OS library doesn\u2019t come close to approaching the depth and breadth of either Apple\u2019s or Samsung\u2019s. Even Fitbit, the relative newcomer, has more to choose from.\n\nAnd yet, frustrating as the Gen 5 can be, I still like it. It\u2019s hard to explain, I know. It\u2019s just a really nice, solid watch. And what works, works pretty well.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch Active2\n\nThe new Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 doesn\u2019t have quite as rich a fitness and health suite or as long a battery life as the Versa 2. But it\u2019s close. Neither does it have quite as elegant a user interface or feature-packed hardware as the Apple Watch Series 5. But again, it\u2019s close.\n\nBut who\u2019s complaining? It\u2019s packed with features. It does just about everything both fitness-first and smartwatch-centric competitors do. It even has built-in cellular. And it costs $299 for the larger, 44mm version (40mm, $279), just $100 more than the Versa 2 \u2013 and $200 less than the cellular-enabled Apple Watch Series 5.\n\nNow, you might wonder why Samsung released the Active2 just six months after coming out with the original Active. Because Samsung didn\u2019t replace the original. It\u2019s selling both devices, the former at $199, $100 less than the Active2.\n\nThe source of the confusion is the generational designation. I might have called it something like the Active XL, or Active Ultra. But whatever.\n\nIn addition to incorporating cellular capability, Samsung also doubled the number of heart rate sensors, to eight, a move no doubt designed to help improve accuracy. In my tests, I did notice a difference in the Active2\u2019s ability to maintain continuous readings, even with my wrist contorted in ways that let more ambient light flood in under the watch face. It also managed to log sleep stages during a couple nights that, for whatever reason, the Versa 2 could not.\n\nThe CBS Sports app on the Samsung smartwatch (Photo: Mike Feibus)\n\nSamsung recently upgraded its smartwatch interface, and notifications, as well as the overall look and feel, are more attractive and friendly than before \u2013 though still not quite up to the Apple Watch standard, or even Wear OS.\n\nPerhaps the biggest need for improvement: The Active2 is long on health data yet comparatively short on insight. That\u2019s improving, though it is still an area where Fitbit remains the clear winner.\n\nThe envelope, please \u2026\n\nAnd the winner \u2026 well, that depends on what you want out of a smartwatch.\n\nHopefully, by now, there is enough difference in form, function and price that your device-to-be is calling your name. (Unless it\u2019s the Versa 2, which doesn\u2019t have a speaker. Sorry.) But just in case:\n\n\u2014If you have an iPhone, you want a premium, full-featured performer with a few extras \u2013 and, oh, and by the way, you already know how well you sleep, thank you very much \u2013 then consider the Apple Watch Series 5\n\n\u2014If an abundance of health and fitness insights above all else is really what you\u2019re after, then select the Fitbit Versa 2\n\n\u2014If what you\u2019re after is a really nice watch with enough battery and smarts to get you through the day, then take a hard look at the Fossil Gen 5, and\n\n\u2014If you like a lot of health and fitness data to help draw your own conclusions, you care about sleep, and you\u2019d really like to leave your phone behind sometimes when you walk the dog or go for a run, then check out the Samsung Active2.\n\nBut most importantly, if what you want is a smartwatch that will sit on your wrist for a few years before it starts showing its age, then you can\u2019t go wrong with any of these.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Mike Feibus is president and principal analyst of FeibusTech, a Scottsdale, Arizona, market research and consulting firm, and producer of Privacy Now, a twice-monthly interview series on YouTube.
