It\u2019s impeachable.", "language": "en", "text": "The contrast that Henninger drew, and that Mulvaney faintly echoes, is striking. Henninger seems to imply that the status of a course of action as \u201chardball\u201d politics suffices to clear it of being an impeachable offense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut, of course, the designation provides no such vindication. The category of \u201chardball politics\u201d is very broad. A basic definition is pursuit of political victory through methods that violate norms. Political analysts typically attribute the earliest account of the phenomenon to the Italian political philosopher Niccol\u00f3 Machiavelli, after whom the devil himself may have been nicknamed \u201cOld Nick.\u201d\n\nIn his handbook for rulers, \u201cThe Prince,\" Machiavelli wrote that \u201cit is necessary for a prince . . . to learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge and not use it, according to the necessity of the case.\u201d While it is useful for a prince to appear to be merciful, faithful, humane, honest and religious, the successful prince, Machiavelli argued, must often also act against all those values.\n\nBut here\u2019s the tricky thing about hardball politics. Social norms come in a variety of forms \u2014 cultural values, parliamentary rules of procedure and laws, for instance \u2014 and hardball politics can include actions that violate norms of any or all of these kinds. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plays hardball politics by violating norms of democratic practice \u2014 such as refusing to move forward on President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. President Richard M. Nixon surely thought he was playing hardball politics when his underlings sought to steal the papers of his Democratic opponents. Perhaps the most prominent recent example of hardball politics was the killing of Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi by the operatives of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi state. Khashoggi\u2019s murder in October 2018 was directed toward tamping down dissent and controlling factionalism. The prince and Saudi Arabia appear to have gotten away with it, which makes it successful hardball politics, as well as murder.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s adventurism, too, might well count as hardball politics \u2014 but it can also count as an impeachable offense. The categories are not mutually exclusive.\n\nWhat makes an impeachable offense? Violations of the law or Constitution, including of the president\u2019s constitutional oath to exercise the powers of the office faithfully, when such violations rise to the level of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d The requirement that the president exercise the powers of the office faithfully includes a norm that the president use the powers of the office in the national interest, not to advance his personal interest. Doing the latter is abuse of power.\n\nThe politics necessarily involved in foreign policy should consist of securing success for a policy agenda, even if that agenda has a partisan or ideological slant, not in sourcing or manufacturing dirt on a political opponent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani\u2019s strange role in this whole affair underscores where and how things have gone wrong. Presidents appoint special envoys all the time at their own discretion \u2014 and without Senate approval \u2014 to do necessary diplomatic work to drive a policy agenda forward. But historically, they generally give those people a formal title of some kind to indicate that they are pursuing the interests of the president of the United States, on behalf of the United States. That Giuliani was dispatched to Ukraine and given authority over the Ukrainian policy of the United States, in no other capacity but that of Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, itself reveals that the agenda being pursued was driven by the president\u2019s personal interests. Had the president been pursuing a genuine policy agenda in the national interest, he could have made Giuliani a special envoy with the stroke of a pen.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with the president\u2019s use of Giuliani is not that he used Giuliani for diplomacy, but the specific agenda Trump gave him. While precedent has emerged that enables the president to use whomever he pleases to conduct foreign policy, that precedent does not also authorize the president to reduce foreign policy to personal interest, in violation of his oath of office. The specific course of conduct undertaken is what makes the president\u2019s version of hardball politics impeachable.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "These categories are not mutually exclusive.", "authors": ["Danielle Allen", "Contributing Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Va0IGMMOvqHltDmAwxzHGV3wpIU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F6RLAPXRZMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
