The first would be to completely ignore crypto-assets, which would not mitigate any of the potential risks. The second option would be to ban all cryptocurrencies and the third available option, which is the most preferred one in Europe and France according to Beau, is to establish and standardize crypto regulations across the board.\n\nThe challenge of standardization\n\nIndeed, the lack of standardization of regulations and procedures in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces has been identified as a problem both by regulators and industry players. Big Four professional services firm Deloitte noted the lack of standardization as a major obstacle to blockchain adoption in a report last year. \u2018\n\nMonero (XMR) core developer Riccardo Spagni has previously suggested that uneven international regulatory standards will result in a cryptocurrency-related brain drain, as the talent involved in the industry moves to the most beneficial jurisdictions.\n\nLawmakers in some countries have attempted to get ahead of such an exodus of talent and investment by making friendly regulatory environments within their home jurisdictions. Earlier this year, United States Representative Warren Davidson reintroduced the Token Taxonomy Act \u2014 a bill that would exclude cryptocurrencies from classification under U.S. securities laws.", "description": "The deputy governor of Banque De France said that central banks really only have three available options to address cryptocurrencies: ignore, ban or adopt", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8wOTAwOGFkNWRlNzJiZWU2Njk5OThkYWZkNDQ1NDczYS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
