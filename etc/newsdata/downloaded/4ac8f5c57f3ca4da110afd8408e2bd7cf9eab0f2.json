Claimants need the Thomas Cook reference number, and must also fill in the amount they have paid to the company.\n\nThe applicant must also provide their bank account number and sort code.\n\nThe requirement has heightened concerns about scams seeking to extract financial details from unwitting Thomas Cook customers.\n\nThe CAA has warned that claimants cannot expect a rapid response: \u201cWe are aiming to complete our assessment of your claim within the next 60 days,\u201d they are told.\n\nIt comes as a leading travel figure has criticised the authorities for allowing the firm\u2019s failure to happen.\n\nMike Gooley, founder and chairman of one of the UK\u2019s most successful travel businesses, Trailfinders, has said that all travellers\u2019 payments should be safeguarded until the holiday has taken place.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to ring-fence client funds and properly protect consumer\u2019s funds in travel has been spurned repeatedly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTravellers booked on Thomas Cook will wait weeks or possibly months for their refunds from the Air Travel Trust fund, which will restrict many from rebooking their holiday.\u201d\n\nTrailfinders keeps customers\u2019 money in a separate trust account until the trip is finished, whereupon the cash is paid.\n\nGooley said that with the taxpayer picking up the \u00a340m cost of flying non-Atol passengers back free of charge, the message to consumers is: \u201cBook with a big airline for free protection.\u201d\n\nThe Trailfinders boss asked: \u201cIn their death throes Thomas Cook were offering discounts to bring in bookings \u2013 close to or below \u2013 cost to stay liquid. Were they in fact trading while insolvent?\u201d\n\nTwo hours before Thomas Cook collapsed, it sold a one-week package holiday in Corfu for \u00a3187 for travel in October, including flights, transfers and accommodation.\n\nGooley also predicted: \u201cThe ripple effects of Thomas Cook will see dozens of tour operator failures in the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nMany smaller companies had planned to use Thomas Cook to fly their customers. These firms are faced with the prospect of paying far higher fares, or handing their clients full refunds. They cannot simply ask travellers to pay more.\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook is expected to dominate the annual convention of Abta, the travel association, which is getting underway in Tokyo.", "description": "Two weeks on from the collapse of Thomas Cook, the repatriation airlift known as Operation Matterhorn has ended \u2013 and customers are now able to claim refunds.
