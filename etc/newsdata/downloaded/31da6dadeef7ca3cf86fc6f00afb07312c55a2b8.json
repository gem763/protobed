Now to be getting hit with the retirement talk is really a big swing for me to get used to hearing. I will tell you that I am def not ready to retire. I still love this and am very hungry to get back in there. I believe I have the abilities to still be world champion.\u201d\n\nWeidman, 35, moved up to light heavyweight in hopes for a career resurgence but was quickly shut down by Reyes. His recent downswing includes a two-fight losing streak. Weidman earned his last win in July 2017, a submission over Kelvin Gastelum.\n\nYou can read Weidman\u2019s full statement below:", "description": "Despite dropping five of his last six bouts, all by stoppage, the former UFC champion assures everyone he intends to fight on.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "The Blue Corner", "Mike Bohn", "Dan Tom"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/chris-weidman-ufc-boston.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
