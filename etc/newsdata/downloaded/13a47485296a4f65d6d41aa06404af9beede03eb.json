Now, Mother Nature has turned off the spigot, and the landscape has shifted from lush and green to barren and brown.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s drought monitor released Thursday classified much of the Washington region in its \u201cabnormally dry\u201d category, just one step away from drought.\n\n\n\n(U.S. Drought Monitor)\n\nWashington has received 0.11 inches of rain this month, more than two inches less than the norm, the sixth driest September on record. No more than 0.05 inches of rain has fallen in a single day. By comparison, Washington was deluged by 9.73 inches of rain last September.\n\nThis month\u2019s minuscule rain total follows both a drier-than-normal August and second half of July. Since mid-July, Washington has posted about three inches of rain, compared with the historical average of about seven inches.\n\n\n\nPercent of normal rainfall over the past 60 days. (High Plains Regional Climate Center)\n\nMeanwhile, the forecast shows little promise for substantial rainfall in at least the next week. If the spotty showers forecast for Monday night do not materialize, we may go rainless through the end of September, extending our streak of five straight dry days to 16.\n\nThis dry forecast is supported by the National Weather Service\u2019s six-to-10-day and eight-to-14-day outlooks, which favor below-normal precipitation.\n\nThe sudden stoppage in rainfall is probably related to the decline of El Ni\u00f1o, which tends to favor above-normal precipitation in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.\n\nCapital Weather Gang\u2019s Matt Rogers, who specializes in long-range forecasting, said we\u2019ve seen high-altitude winds around the Northern Hemisphere slow way down in response. He said these winds are among \u201cthe lowest we\u2019ve seen in September\u201d and are similar to 2005 and 2007, when Washington also experienced abnormally dry weather. In 2007, we saw a record 34 straight rainless days spanning September and October.\n\nWhen these winds are weak, \u201cyou tend to have more expansive high pressure over the U.S.,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cEverything tends to slow down, and there is less energy in the jet stream.\"\n\nRogers said he sees this pattern persisting through the first half of October, before potentially breaking down in its second half when we might see more storminess return. The National Weather Service\u2019s three-month outlook for October, November and December favors above-normal precipitation for the region.\n\nJason Elliott, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service office serving the Washington region, said fall dry spells such as this aren\u2019t terribly unusual. \u201cIt\u2019s the dry season, where it\u2019s sort of feast or famine,\u201d he said. \u201cEither we get a tropical storm and rain, or we get absolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nBecause of all the rain earlier in the year, the effects of this sudden dryness aren\u2019t as acute. \u201cThis is a short-term flash drought,\u201d Elliott said, noting that its arrival toward the end of the growing season was fortunate. \u201cWe\u2019d definitely be in worse shape if we had worse issues going into this.\u201d\n\nThe lack of rain has reduced streamflows to their lowest levels in a couple of years, Elliott said, meaning that some replenishment is needed in the fall and winter \u201cto recharge the groundwater and the streams.\u201d Otherwise, drought concerns could turn more serious in the spring.", "description": "Mother Nature has turned off the spigot, and the landscape has shifted from lush and green to barren and brown.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "September At Pm", "Jason Samenow Is The Washington Post S Weather Editor", "Capital Weather Gang'S Chief Meteorologist.
