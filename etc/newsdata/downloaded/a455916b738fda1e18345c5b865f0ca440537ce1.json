I had eaten an animal. Not eating animals has become a core part of my belief system.\n\n\"I felt shame and pain for the animal. And felt guilt for having unknowingly consumed a product that goes against my endeavours to reduce my environmental footprint as well as harm to other animals... I was shocked.\"\n\n(Image: Domino's)\n\nHe went on to finish the pizza after staff reassured him it wasn't real ham.\n\nBut afterwards he became ill and realised he had eaten meat.\n\nMr Hukins, from Sydney, said he was offered a voucher by Domino's but it would only cover the cost of a traditional pizza not a plant-based one.\n\nA spokesman for Domino's told Daily Mail Australia they were deeply regretful of the error, and encouraged others to speak up if there was ever an issue with their order.\n\n\"We would like to publicly apologise to our customer,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"This was an inadvertent mistake, which will be used as a learning opportunity for our team members.\n\n\"Domino's has a 100 per cent customer satisfaction guarantee, and each of our team members works hard to deliver meals that meet our customers' requirements, including specific dietary needs.\"\n\nHe added: \"We have specific procedures in place for customers with vegan or allergen requirements, including using fresh gloves and cutting blades for their order.\n\n\"Because of these procedures, we have received positive feedback from customers on our vegan range.\n\n\"But in a busy store environment we know that mistakes, though uncommon, can happen. Where this is the case, our local store will refund or remake the order as soon as possible.\"", "description": "Patrick Hukins, from Sydney, Australia, said he \"felt shame and pain for the animal\" following the blunder which made him ill", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Facebook", "Domino'S"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704249.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Patrick-Hukins2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
