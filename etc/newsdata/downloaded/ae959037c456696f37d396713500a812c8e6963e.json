On Thursday,unveiled the Sonos Move ($399), a battery-powered smart speaker that promises to last up to 10 hours on a single charge. The effort signals how the 17-year-oldcompany is evolving away from solely producing home speakers.\n\n\"We had been so focused on these assumptions of always being in the home on Wi-Fi and plugged into the wall,\" Sonos CEO Patrick Spence told CNN Business. \"We had to work through our ideology that had been holding us back a bit.\"\n\nThe company said an outdoor and portable speaker were some of the top asks from its customers. True to its name, the Sonos Move can be taken on the go or grouped with other Sonos speakers for surround sound or to play music in multiple rooms. The speaker can also tune itself automatically when moved to different parts of the home -- a feature that makes sure the sound quality is clear -- and a \"Suspend\" mode kicks in when it's not in use to preserve the battery for up to five days.\n\nBut the device, which has been in development for about three years, is bigger and heavier than competitors. It's over nine inches tall, six inches wide, and weighs about as much as a newborn baby: 6.6 pounds. (For comparison, Amazon Echo is about six inches tall and three inches wide, while Bose's portable SoundLink Color II speaker weighs just 1.2 pounds).", "description": "The Sonos Move is the company's first battery-powered smart speaker that can be taken on the go.", "authors": ["Kaya Yurieff", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190904112153-sonos-move-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
