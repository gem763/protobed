It's not so bad when you look at chip prices and demand,\" said a Seoul-based fund manager who owns Samsung shares. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nWhile things are looking up for Samsung in terms of chip prices, analysts remain concerned about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on major exporters like South Korea's tech giants.\n\n\"It is difficult to quantify the damage caused by the trade war, but certainly there has been conservative investment and spending by Samsung's server and mobile chip clients due to the trade war,\" Lee Su-bin, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said.\n\nU.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (O: ) gave a bleak profit outlook last week, citing economic and trade uncertainty.\n\nMOMENTUM BUILDING\n\nIn the mobile business, which accounted for about 24% of total operating profit in the second quarter, Samsung is benefiting from U.S. sanctions against Chinese smartphone and network equipment rival Huawei Technologies.\n\nSamsung's share of the European mobile market leapt to a five-year high of more than 40% in the second quarter, while Huawei's slipped below 20%, according to data from research firm Canalys.\n\nShoppers will be leery of buying Huawei's new flagship handset if the U.S. restrictions prevent it from carrying Google (NASDAQ: ) Mobile Services, analysts said.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung's newly launched Note series with fast 5G connection is out-selling its predecessors, market tracker Counterpoint Research said.\n\nSamsung has also released its first foldable smartphone in South Korea and United States, giving \"good momentum\" despite its small contribution to income, said Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at DB Financial Investment.\n\nIn search of growth, Samsung is pouring resources into its telecom network equipment business just as Huawei is getting locked out of such contracts due to security concerns.\n\nSamsung said on Monday it had inked a deal to supply fifth-generation network equipment to Japan's No.2 telco firm KDDI Corp (T: ).", "description": "Recovery beckons for Samsung as chip prices stabilise", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF921WT_L.jpg"}
