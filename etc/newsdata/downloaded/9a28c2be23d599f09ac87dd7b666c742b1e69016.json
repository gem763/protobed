This monologue from MSNBC\u2019s host at the end of his program last night took a lot of guts, and it might end up as a valediction. While NBC News management has gone all in with its pushback against former employee Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book Catch and Kill as a \u201csmear,\u201d Hayes asks the obvious question, and provides the obvious answer. If Farrow\u2019s reporting on Harvey Weinstein was as poor as NBC News wants us to believe now, how did it hit the mark so well just a few weeks after he took it to the New Yorker? And more to the point, why didn\u2019t NBC News want to help Farrow develop his Pulitzer Prize reporting?\n\nBecause, Hayes tells his MSNBC audience, NBC News had \u201ca conspiracy of silence\u201d regarding sexual misconduct at its highest ranks, and apparently still does (via Twitchy):\n\nPlease watch this excellent closing statement by @chrislhayes To stand up this way against his bosses at NBC News is remarkable I should note what makes this even more remarkable is Andy Lack (NBC News Chairman) isn't a big fan of Chris/his show Chris is stepping out here pic.twitter.com/vXnQkJd4eq \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of journalism that you want to do as a journalist,\u201d Hayes declares, \u201cthat everyone who works in this business should want to facilitate.\u201d So why didn\u2019t NBC News choose to facilitate it? Why did it choose to spike the story rather than help Farrow develop it? I asked this question after Andrew Lack\u2019s heated denials of Farrow\u2019s reporting last week, too. That sequence of events that forced Farrow to take his blockbuster reporting outside of NBC has no good explanation \u2014 except, as Hayes maintains here, as part of a conspiracy of silence.\n\nHayes takes shots at the NBA and Republicans who cover for Donald Trump too, but that\u2019s just a pretext for his cruise missile at NBC News. Business Insider calls this a none-too-subtle shot at his own network, but Hayes explicitly aimed this segment at his own corporate headquarters, especially in his final comments about the path of least resistance and real journalism:\n\nHayes then not-so-subtly called out NBC itself, saying, \u201cthe path of least resistance is always there, beckoning seductively with an entirely plausible cover story. You\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry, this isn\u2019t the hill to die on, the story isn\u2019t ready. But of course, it\u2019s the very ease of that path that makes it the enemy of the very work that we as journalists are trying to do.\u201d\n\nThat might be letting NBC News execs off lightly. The least-resistance explanation made some sense if the only issue was Big Harv\u2019s economic, legal, and political clout. With Matt Lauer and other NBC News execs at risk of being exposed, assuming Farrow\u2019s reporting on Lack and Noah Oppenheim are correct, it wasn\u2019t the path of least resistance that they took but full resistance.\n\nSo what will happen to Hayes? NBC News probably won\u2019t burn him immediately, but you can bet they\u2019re not going to stand idly by while one of their own featured hosts calls their management liars on NBC News\u2019 own air at MSNBC. If Lack and Oppenheim manage to survive Catch and Kill, you can bet Hayes won\u2019t.", "description": "\"The path of least resistance.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "Taylor Millard", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hayes-silence.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
