The Cubs had won five straight before that, outscoring the opponents 59-18 during that stretch.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n''We believe our team is at our best when we play the best teams,'' Cincinnati manager David Bell said. ''It's nothing more than that - we can play with those teams.''\n\nThe Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers trail the NL Central-leading St. Louis Cardinals by three games. Chicago and Milwaukee are tied for the second NL wild-card spot, 1 1/2 games behind the Washington Nationals, who hold the first wild card.\n\nChicago opens a four-game series against St. Louis on Thursday night at Wrigley Field.\n\n''We all know what's in front of us,'' Cubs starter Jon Lester said. ''We've got to play good baseball this weekend, and hopefully we can do that.''\n\nWith two outs and none on in the top of the 10th, Cincinnati's Aristides Aquino started the winning rally against James Norwood (0-1) with a single to left. After Aquino advanced on a wild pitch, Josh VanMeter walked, putting runners on first and second. Iglesias then doubled to right to score Aquino with the go-ahead run.\n\nAmir Garrett (5-3) struck out Kyle Schwarber to end the ninth and Raisel Iglesias worked around a one-out double in the 10th for his 33rd save. Nico Hoerner lined out to right to end it.\n\nThe Reds finished with an 11-8 record against the Cubs this season.\n\nStory continues\n\nReds slugger Eugenio Suarez hit his 48th homer, one behind Pete Alonso of the New York Mets for the major league lead. The total is the most ever by a Venezuelan player, breaking the previous mark of 47 by Andres Galarraga.\n\nSuarez also tied the NL record for homers by a third baseman. Mike Schmidt of the Phillies (1980) and Adrian Beltre of the Dodgers (2004) are the others reach the mark.\n\nCincinnati starter Tyler Mahle allowed just one run on one hit in six innings.\n\nLester allowed one run on six hits in five-plus innings.\n\nSuarez's solo shot in the fourth inning gave the Reds a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe Cubs tied it in the bottom half of the inning. Nicholas Castellanos led off with a double, advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on a sacrifice fly by Schwarber.\n\nCincinnati took a 2-1 lead in the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Alex Blandino before Willson Contreras tied it with a two-out solo blast, which came on an 0-2 pitch from reliever Robert Stephenson in the bottom of the inning.\n\nCELEBRATION\n\nSuarez was presented with a huge 9-liter bottle of champagne by the Reds in the clubhouse. He and his teammates drank from it to celebrate his Venezuelan homer record.\n\n''This is absolutely amazing,'' he said. ''I appreciate all my teammates and all of Cincinnati.''\n\nCENTRAL SHOWDOWN\n\nThe Cubs conclude their final homestand with a four-game set against the Cardinals starting Thursday night. The teams then play three games in St. Louis next weekend.\n\n''When you look at that schedule at the beginning of the season, you hope you have an eight-game lead by the time this occurs,'' Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. ''But then you get in the position we're in, you're thankful that you have to play them that many times.''\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nReds: C/INF Kyle Farmer (strained left oblique) was activated from the 10-day IL before the game. ... ING Freddy Galvis missed his fourth straight game with left knee soreness.\n\nCubs: Closer Craig Kimbrel (right elbow inflammation) threw with the rest of the relievers before the game.
