F***! You're dead! You are dead!' a worker can be heard screaming.\n\nOther workers were shown yelling in glee as they bolted the horses in the head with a stun gun - some up to five times before they died.\n\nAnimal welfare and behaviour scientist Professor Paul McGreevy told the ABC there was 'no way' the racing industry could defend the behaviour.\n\n'This is a clear breach of everything the industry has told us. Clearly there's no excuse for that sort of treatment, that's not acceptable... and it's disgusting,' he said.\n\n'The truth that's been revealed by these videos is that thoroughbreds are entering knackeries and abattoirs, and that their treatment within those facilities can be appalling.\n\n'I think we're at a fork in the road moment. There's no denying the footage. This is the sort of material that will shake the industry to its core.'\n\nThe cameras showed that in just 22 days, more than 300 racehorses, who won $5million in prize money combined, were killed\n\nSitting and watching the footage, Mr McGreevy became visibly emotional.\n\nThe investigation also aired accusations of multiple instances of animal cruelty at the slaughterhouses racehorses are being sent to.\n\nThe ABC says despite racing's peak body implementing rules requiring the registration and tracking of horses from their birth to their retirement, racehorses are still being killed in slaughterhouses on a weekly basis.\n\nRacing NSW CEO Peter V'landys tod the ABC he was not aware of any NSW racehorses being sent to slaughterhouses.\n\nHowever, he said if it is occurring the state body would 'put the full force of the law' against offenders.\n\nFollowing the greyhound live-baiting scandal and the momentary banning of the sport, the NSW horse-racing industry announced they would take a proactive stance on the welfare of horses.\n\nAustralia's greyhound racing industry had to go into damage control after it was revealed trainers were tying live piglets, possums and rabbits to train the dogs\n\nFollowing the greyhound live-baiting scandal and the momentary banning of the sport\n\nAustralia's greyhound racing industry had to go into damage control after it was revealed trainers were tying live piglets, possums and rabbits to train the dogs.\n\nThe live piglets, possums and rabbits were strapped to lures before being sent around the private tracks before being chased and killed by dogs.\n\nFormer NSW Premier Mike Baird banned greyhound racing in July 2016, only to overturn it in October saying it was the 'wrong call'.\n\nFollowing the scandal, the new animal welfare measures in NSW and the ACT aimed at protecting horses before, during and after their racing careers.\n\nMr V'landys at the time said every racehorse in NSW would be re-homed and given to someone who wants it.\n\nHowever, the investigation found many NSW horses were being sent to other states to be killed, even those that were still listed as an active racer.\n\nProfessor McGreevy said there's a grey area in regards to regulation as people are still slaughtering horses and exporting meat to markets in Europe, Russia and Japan.\n\n'When we bet on horses we are interacting with this industry and we deserve better, the horses deserve better, people who love the industry deserve better. So the industry's let a lot of people down and a lot of horses down,' he said.\n\nWhile Racing Australia claims only one per cent of retired racehorses are sent to abattoirs, Professor McGreevey said more than that is killed in just one week.\n\nMr V'landys insists that NSW racehorses are being treated well and is unaware of anyone breaking the rules.\n\nIf NSW Racing does find people are breaking the rules, Mr V'landys said they will be dealt with 'pretty swiftly'.\n\nBut people like Mr Celotto and Professor McGreevey claim the industry has already let down a lot of people and a lot of horses.\n\nIn light of the 7.30 report, punters are threatening to boycott the Melbourne Cup.\n\n'By the way, will never bet on Melbourne Cup again or any other horse race,' one user wrote on Facebook.\n\n'BOYCOTT THE MELBOURNE CUP... horse racing has to end,' another commented.\n\n'Everyone should boycott the Spring Racing Carnival. If your workplace has a Melbourne Cup sweep, say no and ask the organiser if he or she really knows what goes on behind the veil of ''glamour'',' a third said.\n\nWhile the majority who watched the report made scathing comments slamming the racing industry, some took to social media claiming it was a 'media blow-up' during racing season.\n\n'Here we go and the once-a-year know it alls start. Why don't you follow and protest EVERY day of the year, NOT just around Melbourne Cup time?' one said.\n\n'Always comes up around cup time,' another commented.\n\n'Must be getting close to Melbourne Cup again. All the half a**ed animal activists come out only this time of year,' a third wrote.\n\nVictorian bookmaker Jonathan Walsh said of the report: 'Considering the improvement that has been made over the last decade it was very poor and typical leftist journalism'.", "description": "An abattoir will be investigated by police over the alleged mistreatment of racehorses after explosive footage emerged showing thoroughbreds being abused.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie", "Lauren Ferri For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/00/19838902-0-image-a-2_1571356768069.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
