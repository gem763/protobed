At the national conservatism conference, Mr. Hazony warned: \u201cYou throw out Christianity, you throw out the Torah, you throw out God, and within two generations people can\u2019t tell the difference between a man and a woman. They can\u2019t tell the difference between a foreigner and a citizen.\u201d \u201cThe only way to save this country,\u201d he added, \u201cto bring it back to cohesion,\u201d is going \u201cto be to restore those traditions.\u201d\n\nIt is far from clear how these traditions could be restored on the national level. Consider education. Since the 1990s, efforts to establish a common curriculum have foundered on public opposition \u2014 even without a controversial emphasis on religion. Rather than uniting a fractured people, such an effort seems more likely to divide us.\n\nAnd the political implications of the Bible are not straightforward. Nationalist conservatives emphasize sexual morality and strong borders. During the revolution, by contrast, the central issue was the danger of monarchy. Not only Paine and Franklin but also more orthodox writers contended that the Hebrew Bible promotes skepticism toward charismatic rulers and the centralization of authority. With the growth of executive power since World War II, this lesson remains essential.", "description": "", "authors": ["Samuel Goldman", "Nytimes.Com Opinion America-Religion-Bible-Nationalists.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
