Directed by Andy Muschietti, \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d was also a necessary win for Warner Bros. following a dismal summer that saw disappointments such as \u201cThe Kitchen,\u201d \u201cGodzilla: King of the Monsters\u201d and \u201cShaft.\u201d\n\nOverseas, \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d scared up a solid $94 million for a global debut of $185 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely thrilled with our result,\u201d Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros.\u2019 president of domestic distribution, said on a Sunday morning call. \u201cAndy Muschietti and New Line, as well as the marketing team led by Blair Rich, created one of those moments where it all works. We\u2019re proud of it.\u201d\n\nThe R-rated horror sequel didn\u2019t receive the same critical love as the first (\u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d carries a 64% on Rotten Tomatoes compared to an 87% for the original). However, audiences were more favorable, giving the same B+ CinemaScore as the \u201cIt.\u201d Over half of opening weekend crowds were male, while 33% were under the age of 25. Younger moviegoers appeared to be even more enthusiastic: Ticket buyers 25 years old and younger awarded the film with an A- CinemaScore and those under the age of 18 gave it an A.\n\n\u201cThe Pennywise character really speaks to [younger audiences] in a big way,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cWe have such a strong millennial audience, which tells us we should have a long play in front of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d clocks in at a lengthy two hours and 50 minutes, nearly 30 minutes longer than the first film. While longer runtimes could result in less screenings and therefore fewer tickets sold, the studio bypassed that by securing 4,570 theaters, the widest September release to date.\n\n\u201cThe movie was long, but we strategically dealt with that by adding a lot more showtimes, which gave audiences an opportunity to see it at a time that works for them,\u201d Goldstein added.\n\nBased on the second half of Stephen King\u2019s doorstop of a novel, \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d picks up 27 years after the Losers\u2019 Club thought they rid their small town of the terrifying clown known as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). When the sewer-dwelling, shapeshifting demon resurfaces, the unlikely heroes return to their hometown of Derry, Maine to get rid of the evil force once and for all. The sequel stars Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader and Isaiah Mustafa as the adult version of the kids who took on Pennywise over a quarter of a century before.\n\nSince \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d was the only newcomer to movie theater marquees, popcorn season leftovers filled out box office charts. In a very distant second place, Lionsgate and Millennium\u2019s \u201cAngel Has Fallen\u201d collected $6 million. After three weeks of release, the Gerard Butler-led action threequel has generated $53.46 million.\n\nUniversal\u2019s comedy \u201cGood Boys\u201d landed at No. 3 with $5.39 million, boosting its domestic bounty to $66.8 million. Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d nabbed fourth place with $4.2 million in its eighth week in theaters and has generated $529 million in North America. Rounding out the top five is Universal\u2019s \u201cFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,\u201d which amassed $3.7 million for a domestic tally of $164 million.\n\nDespite the success of \u201cIt: Chapter Two,\u201d the domestic box office is still down over 6% from last year, according to Comscore. But the last four months of 2019 looks to have some hits in store, including \u201cHustlers,\u201d \u201cJoker,\u201d \u201cFrozen 2\u201d and \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.\u201d", "description": "LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - Leave it to Pennywise to deliver a much-needed jolt to the domestic box office.
