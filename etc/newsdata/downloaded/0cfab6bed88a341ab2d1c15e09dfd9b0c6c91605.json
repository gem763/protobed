REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser/Files\n\nSpot gold rose 0.2% to $1,519.56 per ounce at 0818 GMT per ounce, touching a high since Sept. 12.\n\nU.S. gold futures rose 0.8 % to $1,527.20.\n\n\u201cNo significant news is coming out of the trade war ... until and unless we have some clarity on the negotiations, gold will be supported,\u201d said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit Financial Services.\n\nA U.S.-China trade breakthrough seemed unlikely after President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday he was \u201cnot looking\u201d for a partial deal and Chinese officials cancelled goodwill visits to U.S. farmers.\n\nBut both sides later published positive statements. The U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office described last week\u2019s talks as \u201cproductive\u201d and China\u2019s Commerce Ministry called them \u201cconstructive.\u201d October\u2019s high-level talks remain on track.\n\n\u201cOn a immediate basis gold is trading between the range of$1,465-$1,550. If the trade talks fail gold may rally to $1,660 or even higher,\u201d Hareesh said.\n\nThe bullion has risen about 18% so far this year.\n\nTensions remained elevated in the Middle East after Washington ordered more troops to the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defences, following an attack on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities. The United States has imposed more sanctions on Iran, penalising Iran\u2019s central bank.\n\nSaudi Arabia will appeal to a global gathering in New York this week for concerted action to punish and deter Iran after the strikes.\n\nThe dollar was nearly flat against a basket of currencies, while most Asian share markets slipped on Monday.\n\nHoldings at SPDR Gold Trust, the world\u2019s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 1.2% to 894.15 tonnes on Friday.\n\nCOMEX gold speculators raised net long position by 14,150 contracts to 261,878 in the week to Sept. 17, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\n\nSpot palladium rose 0.8% to $1,655 per ounce, after hitting a record high at $1,664.34 earlier in the session.\n\n\u201cHealthy demand, constrained supply and challenging liquidity conditions are likely driving prices higher,\u201d UBS strategist Joni Teves wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cA breakdown of U.S.-China trade talks, deterioration in economic data and a pullback in equities from the highs presents downside risks for palladium over the remainder of the year.\u201d\n\nSilver nearly 2% to $18.33 per ounce and platinum rose 0.8% to $953.05 per ounce.", "description": "Gold rose to its highest in more than a week on Monday, supported by Middle East tensions and uncertainty over U.S.-China trade talks, while palladium hit an all-time high.", "authors": ["Diptendu Lahiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432849096&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0C2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
