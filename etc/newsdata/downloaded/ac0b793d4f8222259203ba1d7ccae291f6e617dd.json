Earlier this year, Ukraine, the poorest country in Europe, with a chaotic political system (one that is bifurcated between a Russian-friendly minority population mostly in the country\u2019s east), was set to receive $400 million worth of foreign aid from the United States. Some of this aid would include lethal weapons for their military to deter future Russian aggression (in 2014, the Russians infamously invaded and annexed the geostrategically vital Crimean Peninsula).\n\nThe president had previously authorized lethal aid to Ukraine. Trump was annoyed that none of America\u2019s European allies were paying anywhere near as much to help prop up the troubled Ukrainian government. He had also become upset with the amount of money Ukraine had received from American taxpayers over the years \u2014 especially in light of the fact that so many Democrats enjoyed dubious (and prosperous) ties to several shady entities in Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukraine Sideshow\n\nNotably, much of the controversy surrounding the absurd Trump-Russia collusion delusion emanated from sources linked to Ukraine. You see, as a country under active Russian military attack, Ukraine\u2019s very survival is on the line. The Ukrainians were petrified by Trump\u2019s stated desire to negotiate with Russia over several points of contention \u2014 including on the matter of Ukraine. To Kiev, this sounded as though Trump, if elected to the presidency, would sell the besieged country out to Moscow (although just the opposite has occurred under Trump).\n\nThus, Ukraine\u2019s leaders acted assiduously to secure the protection and loyalty of the U.S. government by coopting influential individuals of America\u2019s political class. Many of these Western elites were powerful members of the Democratic Party. Also, the Democrats have long had close associations with Ukraine\u2019s leaders going back to 1994, when the Clinton administration negotiated an alliance with Ukraine wherein the Ukrainians dismantled the 300 nuclear weapons that the Soviet Union left behind in their country, in exchange for sweetheart foreign aid deals and guarantees of American military protection, should the Russians ever return.\n\nOf course, once the nukes were removed from Ukraine, it became vulnerable to attack from its larger Russian neighbor that was still armed with the military assets of the now-defunct Soviet Union. Putin and his siloviki have viewed 20 years of European Union and NATO \u201cdouble expansion\u201d (as they refer to it) as a direct threat to Russia\u2019s territorial integrity. Further, Russian leaders believe that the EU and NATO \u2014 at the behest of Washington, D.C. \u2014 have sought to incorporate Ukraine into these American-dominated organizations, so as to weaken Russia geopolitically.\n\nTrump desired to determine, as he once said in 2016, to determine \u201cwhat the hell was going on\u201d with Ukraine. Why were American taxpayers doling out hundreds of millions of dollars to a country that may never be able to repay that money or could potentially be undermining our democracy at home?\n\nRudy to the Rescue?\n\nIn this morass, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, appears to have embarked upon a personal crusade to identify specific instances of corruption that the Biden family may have engaged in with Ukraine\u2019s government during the Obama administration. Why Giuliani spent so much effort in this endeavor is perplexing. The Left argues it is because Giuliani wanted to gather dirt on Joe Biden. Yet few people in Trump\u2019s orbit seriously think Joe Biden is a real political threat to anyone but himself. For his part, Giuliani insists that his efforts to discover evidence of Joe Biden\u2019s corruption is linked to the wider Trump administration desire to understand the roots of the Russia collusion delusion and the bizarre relationships between top tier Democrats and Ukraine\u2019s political elite.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s Biden obsession aligned, unfortunately, with the Trump administration\u2019s intense review of Ukraine aid and potential nefariousness that Ukraine may have engaged in to prevent Trump\u2019s election in 2016 (in order to avoid losing their erstwhile American allies in the face of increased Russian aggression). Therefore, the Democrats could argue impropriety and push for impeachment, as they are currently doing.\n\nEncrypted Texts Prove Trump Innocent\n\nBefore the impeachment (non)scandal broke, an American State Department official assigned to the embassy in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, texted with America\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, and the Trump administration\u2019s special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, over the State Department\u2019s encrypted text messaging service. In these texts, Taylor announced his objections to the freezing of the foreign aid on the grounds that it was being done to further President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nSondland, who has close ties to the president and his inner circle, explicitly stated that the president did not want \u201cquid quo pro\u201d from their dealings with Ukraine. In other words, the president was not seeking damaging material on Joe Biden from Ukraine\u2019s government in exchange for releasing foreign aid money to Ukraine. Trump\u2019s moves in Ukraine had to do with overall corruption and, more importantly, ensuring American taxpayers were not being bilked in the form of generous foreign aid to a broken government.\n\nThe Democrats claim that Trump attempted to garner a bribe from Ukraine; that he explicitly wanted damaging information on Joe Biden heading into the 2020 presidential campaign in exchange for giving the $400 million (plus the lethal aid) to Ukraine. This does not appear to be the case at all. What\u2019s more, the recently released encrypted text messages between Kurt Volker, Bill Taylor, and Gordon Sondland indicate that the president and his team were less interested in damaging Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign than they were in getting to the bottom of potential Ukrainian malfeasance (while using U.S. foreign aid as leverage to get Ukraine to shape up its behavior). And, it should be noted here, the pursuit of corruption is a legitimate function of the U.S. government \u2014 and since Donald Trump is the chief executive, he is well within his rights to inquire about potential corruption in foreign countries with the leaders of those countries.\n\nThe two events, freezing foreign aid to Ukraine and Giuliani\u2019s pursuit of Joe Biden\u2019s troubling past in Ukraine, are, in fact, unrelated. The Ukrainians claim they felt \u201cpressured\u201d by the Trump administration to investigate Biden in exchange for receiving the vital aid money and weapons.\n\nWhile Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed support for Trump and the general global nationalist-populist movement, many of Ukraine\u2019s elite \u2014 notably the previous president, Petro Poroshenko, and his inner circle \u2014 distrust and dislike Donald Trump. It remains to be seen whether or not Zelensky can clear out the anti-Trump elements within his own government before they can damage Trump\u2019s presidency further.\n\nUkraine Isn\u2019t Worth a War with Russia\n\nPresident Trump clearly does not believe that Ukraine is a land worth potentially warring against nuclear-armed Russia over (he\u2019s right about that, by the way). Continuous, unquestioning, foreign and lethal aid to Ukraine only destabilizes the region further while doing little to mitigate the risk of a large-scale conflict with nuclear-armed Russia \u2014 and Trump intuitively understands this.\n\nThat so many powerful people from America\u2019s political class appear to have been bought and paid for by Ukrainian partisans is disturbing enough. That this reality could help precipitate a potential conflict with Russia is even worse. More than that, though, the idea that the president cannot demand that U.S. taxpayers get a better deal for risking so much by giving so much to a failing state, like Ukraine; or that a U.S. president cannot discuss anti-corruption investigations with his Ukrainian counterpart \u2014 without the risk of being made to endure a wasteful impeachment inquiry \u2014 is even more galling. The Democrats are desperate and must be punished at the polls for their continuing absurd behavior.\n\nAnd the president must be allowed to conduct matters of state unimpeded by congressional overreach \u2026 just as the Constitution envisioned the president doing.\n\nBrandon J.
