Mexico, Chile and Belize likewise follow suit within the next week.\n\nGrowing up on suburban Long Island in the \u201870s and \u201880s, I don\u2019t think I heard much, if anything, about the annual festival. At the time, our town of Baldwin was very white, and our family\u2019s history was likewise.\n\nJOSHUA ROGERS: FAMILIES IN PAIN DELIVER POWERFUL COURTROOM LESSONS IN FORGIVENESS\n\nAt just 16, my mother\u2019s great-grandmother came alone from Ireland. I always pictured her leaning over the rail of the ship, afraid but also gazing in awe and excitement at the New York City skyline, her red hair blowing in the salty, ocean air.\n\nMy father\u2019s family emigrated from Poland. Tough, gruff and rough, my grandfather, a second-generation American, became a laborer and painter and lived in a German working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBecause of these familial backgrounds, our family saw legal immigration as a ladder to a better life. My parents spoke about those who \u201ccame over\u201d in reverential terms. They talked about the discrimination they faced and how, by assimilating into the culture and practicing the tenets of their faith, they courageously overcame enormous obstacles.\n\nSo maybe it came as something of a surprise to me that when my wife and I began the application process for adopting our second child, the question of \u201crace\u201d caused me to pause and ponder, if only for a short while. After all, I was already from an \u201cimmigrant\u201d family.\n\nWe were introduced to our first son\u2019s birth mother through a friend of a friend. Beautiful Julianna could pass as my wife\u2019s sister. If we didn\u2019t mention adoption, nobody would have known by looking at our family of three.\n\nBut here we were filling out papers for a second adoption and the caseworker asked us if we were looking to adopt a Caucasian boy or girl \u2013 or were we open to an African-American or Hispanic child?\n\nBeing a father of children of different races is a regular reminder of something my parents taught us from the very beginning, specifically that no race is superior to another.\n\nYears ago, many Caucasian families were reluctant to adopt non-white children for fear of sticking out or the child being targeted. Thankfully, times have changed, and cultural acceptance of mixed-race marriages coupled with international adoption has more or less \u201cnormalized\u201d multi-race families who don\u2019t all have the same skin tone.\n\nWe told the caseworker we\u2019d welcome a \u201cnon-white\u201d child, and in so many wonderful ways, life has never been the same since.\n\nWill\u2019s arrival not only expanded our family but also gave us a greater appreciation of Hispanic culture. We know only a little bit about his birth parents but were told they have Mexican and Spanish roots.\n\nBeing a father of children of different races is a regular reminder of something my parents taught us from the very beginning, specifically that no race is superior to another. As the old Christian children\u2019s song goes, \u201cJesus loves the little children, All the children of the world. Red, brown, yellow, Black and white, they are precious in His sight\u2026\u201d\n\nIt also opened my eyes to the fact we as a culture still have a long way to go. At a rest stop on the way home from visiting Julie\u2019s parents shortly after receiving Will, a woman looked at my blond-haired wife and olive-skinned son and said snidely, \u201cHe\u2019s obviously not yours, huh?\u201d\n\nJulie bit her tongue, smiled and said, yes, indeed, she was his mother and proud to be so.\n\nIt\u2019s occurred to me that adoption has probably done more for race relations than any billion-dollar effort by the United Nations. That\u2019s because at the core of racism is hatred borne of ignorance. And strong multi-race families demonstrate that you don\u2019t fall in love with a \u201crace\u201d or skin pigmentation \u2013 you fall in love with a person and the millions of little things that make them who they are.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWe\u2019re looking forward to learning more about Will\u2019s Hispanic heritage in the years to come. But not a day goes by that my wife and I don\u2019t think about Will\u2019s birth mother, a young Hispanic woman we\u2019ve never met, but who carried him to term and bravely chose to make an adoption plan for him because she was unprepared to parent.\n\nWe are eternally grateful for her and celebrate her sacrifice and ancestry on a daily basis, not just one month out of the year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA", "description": "Strong multi-race families demonstrate that you don\u2019t fall in love with a \u201crace\u201d \u2013 you fall in love with a person and the millions of little things that make them who they are.", "authors": ["Paul Batura", "Paul J.
