I am not talking about Wall Street, I am talking about the average person the street and the average business. Three interest rate cuts to me across three months signals panic, not something that is in control,\u201d J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Alex Dryden said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\nOthers agree Powell is walking a tightrope into the second to last FOMC meeting of 2019.\n\nFILE - In this Oct. 4, 2019, file photo Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell listens to feedback during a panel at the Federal Reserve Board Building in Washington. The Fed concludes its two-day meeting Wednesday, Oct. 30. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) More\n\nExplained Payden & Rygel chief economist Jeffrey Cleveland, \u201cThe Fed has to do its best not to say boo to the stock market. So they have to deliver the rate cut, there will be some dissenters so that that will bring some uncertainty. But I think they want to leave the option on the table to cut again. They don\u2019t want to shut the door on that by saying they are done.\u201d\n\nA loud boo in the face of Mr. Market by the Fed could come in its policy statement, suggests veteran trader Tom Essaye of Sevens Report Research.\n\n\u201cThe first is about midway through the paragraph and it states \u201cuncertainties about this outlook remain.\u201d The phrase is the Fed referring to its optimistic view of the U.S. economy (i.e. things look fine but uncertainties remain). One way the Fed could tell markets it is done cutting rates is to change this statement to say that \u201crisks are balanced\u201d or something similar. Point being, the Fed could remove the \u201cuncertainty\u201d part and just be more confident in its positive view. Such a move would be hawkish,\u201d warns Essaye.\n\nAdds Essaye, \u201cSecond, at the end of the second paragraph, the Fed said in September it \u201cwill act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201d This effectively told us the Fed is willing to cut rates at the next meeting. Tomorrow, to signal it\u2019s done with rate cuts, the Fed could remove this sentence, and/or insert the word \u201cpatient\u201d somewhere in the second paragraph. This would essentially be the Fed telling markets rate cuts are over, and the Fed is on hold.\u201d\n\nThat, too, would be hawkish Essaye believes and likely negative for stocks.\n\nBy and large, the market expects the Fed to deliver its third interest rate cut of the year on Wednesday afternoon. Another cut to the Fed funds rate would bring the range to 1.5% and 1.75%, compared to 2.25% and 2.5% earlier in the year. The rate cuts have mostly been viewed on Wall Street as simply dialing back the hikes last year from Powell that went onto tank the stock market in December 2018 \u2014 not necessarily more aggressive monetary policy.\n\nSo, investors are betting Powell & Co. will truly go down the path of an easing campaign in 2020 to counteract the negative economic impact of the U.S. versus China trade war. Inflation has also continued to be below the Fed\u2019s targeted 2% level, leaving the scope for more rate cuts.\n\nThose bets on even lower rates by investors could easily be seen in the record-setting S&P 500 this week.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
