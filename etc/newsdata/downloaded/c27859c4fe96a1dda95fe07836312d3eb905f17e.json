In Alabama, for instance, a mentally ill man died from flesh-eating bacteria 15 days after being booked into the Mobile County Metro Jail in 2000. And in 2013, a 19-year-old man died of gangrene less than a month after he was booked into the Madison County Jail. In both cases, officials denied wrongdoing and surviving relatives settled lawsuits alleging that poor jail health care contributed to their loved ones\u2019 deaths.", "description": "", "authors": ["Pro Publica", "Propublica.Org Article These-Sheriffs-Release-Sick-Inmates-To-Avoid-Paying-Their-Hospital-Bills"], "top_image": ""}
