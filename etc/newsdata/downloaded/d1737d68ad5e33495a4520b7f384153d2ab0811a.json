But perhaps the film\u2019s overwhelming ace is an overarching awareness of just how pointless it really is, made with the same disposability with which it should be consumed.\n\nThe 50 best comedians of the 21st century Read more\n\nTasked with transporting Funny Or Die\u2019s often hysterically funny webseries into a Netflix movie, writer-director and Two Ferns co-creator Scott Aukerman has aimed low and mostly, kind of, succeeded. The plot, and it\u2019s excessively generous of me to call it that, sees Galifianakis in hot water after almost drowning guest Matthew McConaughey in cold water during an on-set accident which also destroys the show\u2019s lo-fi set. His hateful boss Will Ferrell soon arrives with an intimidating proposal: to save himself he must film 10 new episodes in two weeks while on the road, ending up in LA to deliver the tapes.\n\nWhat follows is as scrappy as one would expect, a thinly drawn road trip caper sandwiching all-too-brief clips of celebrities deflecting cruel verbal jabs. It\u2019s predictably in these moments that the film proves funniest with a long list of stars lining up for some wonderfully unrestrained attacks. Highlights include an assault on Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s unusual looks (\u201cthe type of face that masturbates all day wearing a helmet\u201d), Jon Hamm\u2019s comedy Tag (\u201cone of the most iconic pieces of mediocrity ever created\u201d), Paul Rudd\u2019s career (\u201cWhich do you prefer: being in Marvel movies or being in stuff that nobody\u2019s ever heard of?\u201d) and Matthew McConaughey\u2019s recent career choices (\u201cAll right, all right, all right \u2026 sorry I was just reading the box office returns for your last three movies\u201d). As evidenced by his utter lack of vanity throughout his work to date, Galifianakis is also the subject of numerous putdowns (a colleague refers to him as an \u201cabsolute piece of shit garbage rat loser\u201d while Ferrell calls him \u201cso dumb and so fat\u201d).\n\nGiven the current sorry state of feature-length comedy, there are enough laughs here to automatically make it funnier than most of its bigger, and more ambitious, big-screen counterparts. But as hilarious as it might be when it\u2019s focused on ridiculing the rich and famous, it\u2019s equally forgettable when trained on its barebones narrative. There are brief moments of inspired silliness outside of the interview format, like Orange is the New Black\u2019s Lauren Lapkus airing her confusion over what a chicken strip is or a surprise cameo from Chrissy Teigen who reveals that her origins story is essentially the plot of The Box, but it\u2019s mostly filler. There\u2019s also just too much of it in comparison to the talkshow segments, which are all frustratingly short.\n\nMovies based on TV shows are often criticised for feeling like a stitched together bumper edition of episodes but in this instance, I\u2019d have been happy for that to be the case, sandwiched between two ferns rather than aimlessly out on the road.", "description": "Zach Galifianakis\u2019s abrasive celebrity talkshow gets transformed into a featherweight, intermittently funny, full-length feature for Netflix", "authors": ["Benjamin Lee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc2f3aeb1db504aa67fba35b9da06019a85d3fcb/0_149_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2e33cc4ace21402b42c99c1b87378b81", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
