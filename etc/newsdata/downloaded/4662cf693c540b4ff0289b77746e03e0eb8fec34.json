In an effort to convince Towelie that he is sincere, Randy begins shouting: \u201cFuck the Chinese government.\u201d\n\nThe episode comes days after the show\u2019s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, issued a fake apology the communist regime after Chinese authorities banned the Comedy Central show following last week\u2019s episode that called out the nation\u2019s rampant censorship.\n\n\u201cLike the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We, too, love money more than freedom and democracy,\u201d the apology read. \u201cXi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now, China?\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s episode, entitled Band in China, also mocks jokes about China\u2019s crackdown on Winnie the Pooh, whose character has repeatedly been compared to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe episode also takes a dig at Hollywood\u2019s willingness to bend to Beijing\u2019s censorship demands when Stan and his crew are approached American director working for the Chinese film company about making a biopic of their heavy metal rock band.\n\n\u201cYou got to lower your ideals of freedom if you want to suck on the warm teat of China,\u201d the director says at one point. \u201cEveryone else is fine with China approving our entertainment. Even the PC Babies don\u2019t seem to mind. And PC Babies cry about everything!\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "South Park escalated its criticism of the Chinese communist regime on Wednesday, with lead character Randy Marsh at one point saying \"f**k the Chinese government.\"", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/southparkfchina2-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
