REUTERS/Jason Redmond/File Photo\n\nAlberta enacted Bill 12, dubbed the \u201cturn off the taps act\u201d in May, after it was passed by the previous provincial government in retaliation for British Columbia opposing the expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline.\n\nThe Trans Mountain project, which would nearly triple the flow of crude from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to British Columbia\u2019s coast, is an ongoing bone of contention between Canada\u2019s two westernmost provinces.\n\nEnvironmental opposition and regulatory delays have held up the project for years and court challenges are ongoing despite the federal government buying the pipeline last year for C$4.5 billion to help to facilitate construction.\n\nBill 12, formally known as the \u201cPreserving Canada\u2019s Economic Prosperity Act\u201d, has yet to be used to cut energy shipments. However, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said it would provide leverage in discussions with British Columbia counterpart John Horgan.\n\nKenney\u2019s United Conservative Party government was elected in April with promises to stand up for the province\u2019s struggling energy sector and enacting the turn-off-the-taps legislation underscored that belligerent approach.\n\nBritish Columbia\u2019s lawyers filed court actions against Bill 12 and on Tuesday the federal court said the province had met the criteria for a temporary injunction by showing the legislation would cause harm to its residents.\n\n\u201cThe Court rejected Alberta\u2019s argument that this harm is speculative, finding that it was reasonably certain and noted that whether or not the harm is triggered lies entirely within Alberta\u2019s discretion,\u201d the court said in its ruling.\n\nThe courts will hear British Columbia\u2019s application for the legislation to be ruled unconstitutional at a future date.\n\n\u201cIn our reading of the constitution Alberta is not allowed to restrict the flow of refined products to other provinces to punish them for positions that are taken that they do not like,\u201d said David Eby, British Columbia\u2019s Attorney General.\n\nAlberta\u2019s Energy Minister did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAsked about the court\u2019s ruling, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would not engage in internal conflicts between two provinces.", "description": "A Canadian court on Tuesday temporarily blocked legislation enabling the province of Alberta to restrict oil and gas flows to British Columbia, leaving the constitutionality of the measure to be decided at a later trial.", "authors": ["Nia Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433516758&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1R4-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
