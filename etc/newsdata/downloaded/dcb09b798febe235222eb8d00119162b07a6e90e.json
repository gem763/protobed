He pledged to bring a fresh vote this week - possibly as soon as Monday - and deliver Brexit by October 31.\n\nEU officials are likely to meet on Sunday (Brussels time) to discuss possible ways forward. European leaders might try to avoid making a call on any Brexit extension until events become clearer in the coming week, but will probably agree a delay of some kind.\n\n\"The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react,\" Mr Tusk tweeted on Saturday night (Sunday AEDT).\n\nBrexit postponed\n\nFormer Tory cabinet minister Mr Letwin's successful amendment to the weekend's Brexit motion pushed back the critical, decisive vote until after MPs vote through the technical legislation enabling his Brexit deal - probably early this week.\n\nA full house for Mr Johnson's attempt to get a decisive parliamentary vote on Brexit. AP\n\nMr Letwin said he shared Mr Johnson's desire for Brexit to take place on Halloween, but his aim was to avoid any risk of accidentally stumbling into a no-deal Brexit. His amendment creates a fall-back of delaying Brexit if parliament remains in stasis over the Brexit deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe amendment forces Mr Johnson to comply with the rebel and opposition MPs' law, passed last month, that if he didn't pass a Brexit deal through parliament by October 19 then he had to ask the EU for a delay.\n\nMr Johnson on Sunday (AEDT) railed against the law's stricture, and has sought to comply only with its letter, not its spirit. A Scottish court case resumes on Monday that will test whether he has sufficiently toed the line.\n\n\"I continue in the strong belief that the best thing for the UK and the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31,\" Mr Johnson told parliament after the Letwin Amendment vote.\n\n\"I hope that our European Union colleagues and friends will not be attracted as the benches opposite are by delay. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be attracted by delay.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had earlier said he wouldn't agree to any further Brexit delay, although that may turn out to have been posturing ahead of the British parliament's weekend session. He and Mr Johnson reportedly spoke after the British PM's defeat on Saturday.\n\nA way forward?\n\nThe narrow victory for Mr Letwin's amendment prompted some commentators to suggest Mr Johnson may actually be able to win the vote on his deal, once the Brexit enabling bill is passed. But the dynamics on the floor of parliament are fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I hope that honourable members faced with a choice of our new deal, our new deal for the UK and the European Union, will change their minds because it was pretty close today. I hope that they will change their minds and support this deal in overwhelming numbers,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\nAnti-Brexit protesters staged a huge rally outside parliament during the weekend sitting. AP\n\nOpposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn urged Mr Johnson to follow the law and delay Brexit for at least three months.\n\n\"He can no longer use the threat of a no-deal crash-out to blackmail members to support his sell-out deal,\" the Labour leader said.\n\nIt's also possible that opposition parties may now choose to push for a no-confidence vote and trigger an election - but probably not until the EU makes a call on whether to push Brexit back, as MPs want to ensure a no-deal Brexit can't happen.\n\nMr Johnson still hasn't roped in the support of the 10 MPs from the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which could swing things his way. They've dug in against his deal, but continue to choose their words carefully.\n\n\"We will examine all the details of the bill [the Brexit enabling legislation] ... in the light of our overriding concern about the constitutional and economic integrity of the Union [ie the United Kingdom] - that is our priority,\" said DUP parliamentary leader Nigel Dodds.\n\nMr Johnson avoided inflammatory and political language during the parliamentary debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis introductory speech was, by his standards, calm and emollient, vowing Britain would remain a constructive European nation even as it left the bloc's institutional structures.\n\n\"Many times in the last 30 years I have heard our European friends remark that this country is half-hearted in its EU membership and it is true that we in the UK have often been a back-marker - opting out of the single currency, not taking part in Schengen, very often trying to block some collective ambition,\" he said.\n\nWhile Britain had been a nation of sceptical \"half-hearted Europeans\", there was still \"a desire to cooperate with our friends and partners in everything, creatively, artistically, intellectually\" and \"a deep understanding of the eternal need ... for Britain to stand as one of the guarantors of peace and democracy in our continent\".\n\n\"It is precisely because we are capable of feeling both things at once - sceptical about the modes of EU integration as we are but passionate and enthusiastic about Europe - that the whole experience of the last few years has been so difficult for this country and so divisive,\" he said.\n\nShadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer gave one of the most forceful speeches against Mr Johnson's deal, branding it a \"trap-door to a no-deal Brexit\".\n\nThat was because in Theresa May's deal, if the two sides didn't have a new long-term trade deal by the end of 2020, the backstop kept Britain a customs union with the EU; but in Mr Johnson's deal, the default was to leave the transition period with no deal.\n\nHe said Mr Johnson's deal would allow Britain to undercut European labour and environmental standards, and that businesses would suffer from leaving the customs union.\n\nThe DUP's objection is that Northern Ireland can be stuck abiding by EU rules against their will - the bar is quite high for the regional assembly to back out of the special dual-regulatory structure for the province. They also like the de facto customs border between Northern Ireland and the British mainland.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been forced to write to the EU asking to delay Brexit after his deal was blown off course by a rebel Conservative MP's amendment that torpedoed parliament's supposedly decisive weekend vote on the deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.335%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/98080e5963054261188d301df7a23a132acd0f52", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
