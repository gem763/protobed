Vacher replaced Martin Sutherland, who announced he was stepping down in May after the company reported a 77% drop in pre-tax profits.\n\nDe La Rue gave no explanation for why profits would come in so far below expectations.\n\nThe company lost the contract to print UK passports in 2018 and it disclosed in July that the Serious Fraud Office had opened a probe into \u201csuspected corruption\u201d relating to its work in South Sudan.\n\nLed by Vacher, management at the company are \u201cconducting a detailed review of the business\u201d, De La Rue said on Wednesday.\n\nREAD MORE: Boris Johnson's Brexit deal to wipe \u00a370bn off economy by 2029\n\nIt will update the market further when it reports its full-year results on 26 November.\n\n\u201cInvestors might be slightly concerned that no reason is given for today\u2019s profit warning, the second in a little over six months,\u201d said Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cDe La Rue fails a major test for investors: if it didn\u2019t exist as a business today, would you really set it up? Being a specialist banknote printer looks anachronistic in an increasingly cashless world.\u201d\n\nThe company has been at the centre of several investigations by the Serious Fraud Office, including a 2010 examination of falsification of banknote quality certificates by employees.\n\nIn 2011, it spent six months designing and manufacturing the currency for South Sudan, which was then the newest country in the world.\n\nIt is the largest commercial printer of passports in the world, and has designed around a third of the banknotes in circulation around the world.\n\nThe UK government in March 2018 decided not to renew its contract with De La Rue to print British passports, prompting a fiery response from the company.\n\nFrench-Dutch competitor Gemalto was picked for the 10-year, \u00a3490m contract. The government later said that Gemalto would also manufacture the much-anticipated post-Brexit blue passports.\n\nREAD MORE: Peugeot owner in talks to merge with Fiat Chrysler\n\nSutherland demanded that then-prime minister Theresa May visit the company\u2019s factory to outline why her government made the decision to \u201coffshore\u201d the manufacturing of the British passport.\n\nAfter pledging to appeal the contract decision, Sutherland said a month later that De La Rue had taken legal advice and made the \u201cpragmatic business decision\u201d not to contest the UK government decision.", "description": "De La Rue, which is under investigation for suspected corruption, said full-year profits would come in 'significantly lower' than expectations.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RkzrjdsQpaqUwf3eHzvOmA--~B/aD00OTEyO3c9NzM2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6e6efdd0-faf5-11e9-8aef-90fb6d0dce6e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
