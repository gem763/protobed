USA TODAY\n\nJohnson & Johnson is recalling a batch of its baby powder after discovering small amounts of cancer-causing chrysotile asbestos in the product.\n\nThe recall comes as the company remains embroiled in a controversy over accusations that talc in its baby powder caused ovarian cancer, a connection the company has repeatedly denied.\n\nJ&J said Friday that it issued the recall \"out of an abundance of caution,\" noting that it found only \"sub-trace levels\" of chrysotile asbestos in a single bottle someone purchased from an online retailer. The company is recalling all bottles made in that batch: Lot #22318RB.\n\nThe company also said it had \"immediately initiated a rigorous, thorough investigation into this matter, and is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results.\"\n\nIt noted that it had not yet determined whether the bottle was sealed or whether it was even authentic.\n\nFile photo shows Johnson & Johnson's baby powder being squeezed from its container.

The company's stock fell 2.8% in early trading to $132.41, reflecting a loss of more than $12 billion in market capitalization.\n\nThe company has been fighting thousands of lawsuits over the talc in its baby powder.\n\nBaby powder lawsuit: Woman with ovarian cancer awarded $110M from Johnson & Johnson\n\nExposure to chrysotile asbestos, a common type of asbestos, can cause various forms of cancer, including lung, larynx, ovarian and mesothelioma, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nPlaintiffs say the company hid the cancer risk associated with its baby powder over the course of decades.\n\nBut J&J has repeatedly said the product is safe.\n\nThe company said Friday that it \"has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA\u2019s own testing on prior occasions--and as recently as last month--found no asbestos. Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/18/johnson-johnson-baby-powder-recall-asbestos/4020698002/", "description": "Johnson & Johnson is recalling a batch of its baby powder\u00a0after discovering small amounts of\u00a0chrysotile asbestos in the product.", "authors": ["Nathan Bomey", "Published A.M.
