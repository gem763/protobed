He has dismissed the country as nothing but \u201csand and death,\u201d discounted its American-backed Kurdish fighters as \u201cno angels,\u201d and argued that he is winding down \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nBut in recent days, Mr. Trump has settled on Syria\u2019s oil reserves as a new rationale for appearing to reverse course and deploy hundreds of additional troops to the war-ravaged country. He has declared that the United States has \u201csecured\u201d oil fields in the country\u2019s chaotic northeast and suggested that the seizure of the country\u2019s main natural resource justifies America further extending its military presence there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve secured the oil,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters last week at the White House , before reminding them of how, during the Iraq war, he called for selling off Iraq\u2019s oil to defray the conflict\u2019s enormous cost.\n\n\u201cI always said, if you\u2019re going in \u2014 keep the oil,\u201d he said. \u201cSame thing here: Keep the oil.\u201d\n\nSpeaking again at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump said he had done precisely that in Syria. \u201cWe\u2019ve secured the oil,\u201d the president told reporters. \u201cWe have a lot of oil.\u201d", "description": "After dismissing Syria as a land of \u201csand and death,\u201d Mr. Trump is redeploying American troops around its oil fields.
