After weeks of failing to meet ad impressions goals for an agreement with Farmers Insurance \u2014 goals staffers had \u201cbelieved it was unlikely\u201d the company could meet, according to the Wall Street Journal \u2014 management decided to make ads autoplay with the sound on. Reader complaints poured in, staff at several G/O Media sites published a statement distancing themselves from the decision, and Farmers canceled the agreement.\n\nNow there\u2019s something of a staff rebellion afoot. Writers and editors at Deadspin are expressing their opinions over an edict from management to \u201cstick to sports.\u201d For most sites that cover sports, this would be uncontroversial. Deadspin, though, is different: It publishes a lot of sports content, but since its inception, it has also published plenty of other content its writers feel like whipping up. There are lists/rankings, there are political commentaries, there are media commentaries, there are first-person essays, first-person rants, first-person everything.\n\n\u201cTo create as much great sports journalism as we can requires a 100% focus of our resources on sports. And it will be the sole focus,\u201d wrote editorial director Maidment in a memo acquired by the Daily Beast\u2019s Maxwell Tani. \u201cDeadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\u201d Deadspin\u2019s staffers responded by posting pointedly non-sports pieces and tagging content to rankle the bosses:\n\nIn a delicious commentary related to the booing of President Trump at a World Series game over the weekend, Ray Ratto riffed, \u201cNationals Fans Didn\u2019t Stick To Sports.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nResistance to the edict resulted in adverse personnel action:\n\nHi! I\u2019ve just been fired from Deadspin for not sticking to sports. \u2014 Barry Petchesky (@barry) October 29, 2019\n\nBarry Petchesky had been serving as Deadspin\u2019s interim top editor after Megan Greenwell, who formerly held that position, left in August following disagreements with her bosses. Among the management tricks protested by Greenwell was a push-poll/survey that appeared on the site in late July:\n\nDeadspinners knew then what Maidment has confirmed via memo: that an editorial contraction at Deadspin was in the works.\n\nto be crystal clear, as long as I\u2019m in charge Deadspin\u2019s coverage will not change based on this survey or anything other than our excellent staff\u2019s judgement. \u2014 Megan Greenwell (@megreenwell) July 26, 2019\n\nUpon her departure, Greenwell penned a blast at ownership, not to mention the scourge of private equity in the journalism business. \u201cMy colleagues and I know that most Deadspin readers do not want the site to stick to sports. I know this because I have 18 months of experience running the site and 12-ish years of experience reading it, and because I work with people who have seven or eight or nine years\u2019 experience writing and editing for it,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement about the imbroglio, Maidment insisted that the new boundaries still allow room to roam: \u201cYesterday I sent a memo to Deadspin staff stating that our sports site should be focused on sports coverage,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cAs I made clear in that note, sports touches on nearly every aspect of life \u2014 from politics to business to pop culture and more. We believe that Deadspin reporters and editors should go after every conceivable story, as long as it has something to do with sports. We are sorry that some on the Deadspin staff don\u2019t agree with that editorial direction and refuse to work within that incredibly broad mandate.\u201d\n\nTo repeat, Maidment is the editorial director of Deadspin and its sibling sites. As such, doesn\u2019t he have the authority to shape editorial policy? Isn\u2019t that the historical prerogative of a news outlet\u2019s management? Don\u2019t all editorial directors do this? Lowell Peterson, executive director of the Writers Guild of America, East, says this authority is the subject of ongoing discussions with management. \u201cThere are conversations happening today, yesterday and tomorrow between our reps and management about precisely what the contours of this dispute are,\u201d he tells the Erik Wemple Blog. \u201cWe are fighting to ensure that our contract is honored.\u201d\n\nThat contract features an \u201ceditorial independence\u201d clause stipulating that decision about content \u201cmay only be made by editorial, including the Executive Editor. Once a story has been posted it can only be removed by a majority vote of the Executive Editor, the CEO, and the General Counsel, unless required by law.\u201d Also: \u201cThe Company presented its editorial policy lo the union during negotiations. The union will be consulted before this editorial policy is changed.\u201d A separate paragraph enumerating management rights allows Spanfeller and Maidment \u201cto establish or continue policies, practices, and procedures for the conduct of its business, including but not limited to the production and exploitation of Company content, and, from time to time, to change or abolish such policies, practices, and procedures.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen we asked Peterson whether the directive issued by Maidment contravenes the agreement, he declined to issue a yes-or-no answer, citing the union\u2019s ongoing efforts to get clarity on just how the new directive will play out. Attempting to abridge the new standard, Peterson tells the Erik Wemple Blog, \u201cAs long as it has something to do with sports, it\u2019s okay \u2026 [noise indicating confusion] \u2026 I don\u2019t know exactly what management wants to do in terms of editorial direction.\u201d The dismissal of Petchesky is another preoccupation. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely deeply troubled by that. That\u2019s an ongoing conversation as well,\u201d says Peterson.\n\nOn one level, the Spanfeller-Maidment stick-to-sports rule makes a lot of sense. There are many forgettable, garbage posts on Deadspin that have nothing to do with sports. Yet the extraordinary latitude opens the Deadspin content management system to bursts of brilliance not to be found on other news sites, no matter what they\u2019re sticking to. A fine example is Drew Magary\u2019s reconstruction of his near-death experience suffering from a subdural hematoma.\n\nWhat did that have to do with sports, Spanfeller-Maidment?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnother is media-criticism history. Alert Deadspin staffers, with no adhesive relationship to sports, knitted together a legion of Sinclair broadcasters from around the country reading from the same Trumpian script decrying \u201cbiased and false news.\u201d Many individuals had previously described how Sinclair was affecting local news audiences, but Deadspin explained it.\n\nThat video has more than 500,000 non-sporting views on YouTube. How about those numbers, Spanfeller-Maidment?\n\nAgain: Charting broad editorial boundaries traditionally falls to suits. In the case of Deadspin, those suits want staffers to enjoy the freedom of writing creatively on topics connected to sports. Not a bad deal, perhaps. But that\u2019s not Deadspin, that\u2019s something else.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The site's current ownership bought a site that it wants to change.
