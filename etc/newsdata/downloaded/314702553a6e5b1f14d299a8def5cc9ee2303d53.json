The AfD more than doubled its share of the vote. Despite that, it has no chance of entering power yet, as other parties have ruled out joining it in a coalition.\n\nBut the party\u2019s national standing is boosted by the result, which was closely watched in Berlin, as is the status of its state leader Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, considered Germany\u2019s most controversial politician, who has been accused of stoking hatred with anti-Jewish rhetoric.\n\nThe AfD is gaining strength in Germany.

AfD\u2019s showing means it will be impossible for Die Linke (30% of the vote), the left-of-centre Social Democrats (8%) and the Green party (5.5%) to repeat their coalition.\n\nA minority government led by Die Linke is the most likely outcome, reflecting the increasing fragmentation of the political landscape across Germany in recent years.\n\nThe CDU, which rules at the national level in a coalition with its Bavarian sister party the CSU and the SPD, suffered its worst result in the state, losing more than 11 percentage points to take 22.5% of the vote.\n\nThe election campaign was characterised by Nazi slogans and death threats and overshadowed by the deadly attack on a synagogue in the city of Halle earlier this month.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike M\u00f6hring, the leader of the CDU in Thuringia, received a death threat during the campaign.

Neo-Nazis threatened to stab him in the neck or attack one of his election rallies with a bomb if he did not end his campaign.\n\nThe CDU\u2019s general secretary, Paul Ziemiak, said: \u201cIt is a bitter result for the CDU ... and this is a bitter day for the democratic centre of Germany in Thuringia.\u201d\n\nBodo Ramelow, Thuringia\u2019s current prime minister who is extremely popular in the state, has directly blamed H\u00f6cke for allowing people to identify with extremist parties.\n\nRamelow told broadcaster NTV he was proud of Thuringians, who had turned out in record numbers for the vote. He said he hoped that the result would encourage parties who had previously vowed never to work together with his Die Linke to recognise the necessity to do so.\n\n\u201cOn a parliamentary level there are various themes on which we can all work together for the common good,\u201d he said. But he was troubled by the AfD\u2019s strong result. \u201cIt is painful that voters feel that they need to protest against the grand coalition in this way by choosing someone like H\u00f6cke ... But we need to deal with this at the same time, and respect the voters\u2019 decision.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bodo Ramelow, state prime minister of Thuringia, hoped the result would encourage others to work with his Die Linke party.

We fought together, we were victorious together, and now it\u2019s the time to celebrate together.\u201d\n\nThe former history teacher, who was accused of contributing to the antisemitic sentiment behind the Halle attack, has drawn criticism for calling Berlin\u2019s Holocaust Memorial a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d and for demanding more attention be paid in schools\u2019 history teaching towards ordinary Germans\u2019 suffering in the second world war.\n\nH\u00f6cke\u2019s far-right stance is viewed critically within the party, with many AfD members accusing him of threatening its unity. But his ability to draw such an increase in support despite the criticism \u2013 even in a state that bears the scars of Germany\u2019s Nazi past with Buchenwald concentration camp \u2013 is likely to only bolster support for his tactics.\n\nThe Greens\u2019 co-leader Annalena Baerbock said she was disappointed at her party\u2019s performance and that she was \u201cdevastated\u201d by the huge gains made by the AfD, referring to it as \u201cfascistic\u201d. She said the result reinforced the need to invest more time and energy in civil society in eastern Germany.\n\nThe AfD was formed in 2014 as an anti-establishment force opposed to the euro. It quickly evolved to become an anti-immigrant party following the refugee crisis of 2015 when almost one million refugees arrived in Germany. More recently it has concentrated on highlighting the unjust treatment of eastern German citizens in the 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nDie Linke, described as radical left, was established in 2007, emerging from the successor party of the former communist governors of eastern Germany.", "description": "Leftwing Die Linke leads in state of Thuringia, but political landscape is fragmented", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b0e0223a832ab8572d658dccc4641ac3e281382/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fb40d0d80455c3435955ba666a12c0b3", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
