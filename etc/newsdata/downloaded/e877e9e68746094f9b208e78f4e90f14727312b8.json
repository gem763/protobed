(Today, of course, most ostracism takes place in full view in the sewer that is social media.) The secret ballot protects all of us and our democratic rights by allowing citizens to express their preference without fear of retaliation. It\u2019s a crucial right to privacy, one that ensures the free and fair functioning of our political system. Secret ballots are enshrined in everything from student council and condo board elections to the vote for president of the United States.\n\nThere\u2019s something of a loophole in the system, however: Monetary donations to political candidates and causes, no matter how minuscule, are matters of public record. There may be arguments in favor of this system based on \u201ctransparency,\u201d but there is also an inherent danger. The disclosure of political donations opens up politically minded citizens of good faith to retaliation \u2014 and indeed, ostracism. Citizens may fear exercising their democratic rights to support candidates and causes because of the consequences they could face. The danger is real for supporters of parties on the left and the right.\n\nThe dangers, by the way, are not merely theoretical. Who can forget the case of Brendan Eich, who was CEO of the Mozilla Corp. in Silicon Valley until it was revealed that he had donated $1,000 to the campaign for Proposition 8, which banned same sex marriage in California? (Note that Mr. Eich was on the side of the majority.) He was forced to resign. Not only titans of industry fell victim to onslaughts like this; even service workers were ensnared. The manager of El Coyote restaurant in Los Angeles, for instance, was also forced to resign after it was revealed that she donated a mere $100 to the pro-Proposition 8 cause.\n\nToday, those who have the audacity to donate money to President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign are in the crosshairs. In Pittsburgh, a local blogger posted a list of nearly 100 local businesses whose owners have donated to the incumbent and called for a boycott. \u201cThey want to cost people their livelihoods just because you don\u2019t agree with them politically It\u2019s not just absurd, but I believe it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d the chairman of the Allegheny County Republican Party observed, quite rightly.\n\nThe Olive Garden restaurant chain also recently suffered a black eye when a false rumor that its parent company was backing President Trump made the rounds on social media. That the claim was demonstrably false did little to prevent thousands of retweets and pledges to boycott the Italian food chain.\n\nNaturally, it\u2019s in Hollywood where the zeal to out Trump supporters is burning hottest. Actress Debra Messing of \u201cWill and Grace\u201d fame recently mused on Twitter that she would like to see a \u201clist of attendees\u201d at a scheduled fundraiser for the president. \u201cThe public has a right to know,\u201d she said. Her \u201cWill and Grace\u201d co-star Eric McCormack chimed in in agreement.\n\nJohn O\u2019Hurley, a fellow comic actor who appeared in the sitcom \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d had the right riposte. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing a case that falls apart from the sheer weight of its lunacy, as though the Hollywood community needs to be purged of this social and intellectual hygiene problem called conservative thinking,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hurley said. \u201cIt underscores the fact that we aren\u2019t receptive to a diversity of thought which is the exact opposite of what you feel the liberal way would be, and I find that obscene.\u201d\n\nMaking political donations is a free speech right in the United States. But when exercising that right opens one up to danger, that right becomes merely theoretical.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
