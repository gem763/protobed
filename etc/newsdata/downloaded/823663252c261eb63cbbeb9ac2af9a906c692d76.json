Fight to win! Forge exemplary conduct!\"\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping begins a review of troops from a car during Tuesday's military parade.

Police have told residents whose houses look onto the parade route not to look out their windows.\n\nThere will be a civilian parade too, of students, model workers, ethnic minorities and even a few foreigners, walking alongside or traveling in floats celebrating China's achievements, officials said last week.\n\nOnce the show is over, 70,000 doves will be released to symbolize peace, according to state media.\n\nIn the evening, fireworks will light up Beijing.\n\nXi faces mounting challenges, notably in Hong Kong, where more large-scale protests are expected on Tuesday. Police there have warned of \"very serious violent attack.\"\n\nHong Kong went into lockdown on Tuesday with barricades in the city centre, shuttered stores and a heavy riot police presence.

Industrial and transportation air pollution has been slow to disperse due to low pressure and high levels of humidity.\n\nA police officer reacts after getting pepper sprayed as anti-government protesters and pro-China demonstrators clash in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district on Tuesday. (Susana Vera/Reuters)\n\nOrdinary Chinese residents were not permitted to attend the parade, which was limited to a carefully vetted crowd.\n\nOn the eastern end of the main road leading into central Beijing, several kilometers (miles) from Tiananmen Square, crowds gathered craning their necks to see anything.\n\nA roadsweeper urged a bystander to go home and watch the parade on television.\n\n\"You can't walk to Tiananmen Square. You can't go further than here,\" he said.", "description": "China celebrated its growing power and confidence with a massive display of military hardware and troops in Beijing, overseen by President Xi Jinping who pledged peaceful development on the 70th birthday of Communist China.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5303829.1569901541!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/china-70-years.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
