So, if you look at last weekend, we did kick a lot in the air, and Japan managed to contain our aerial battle.\n\n\"But if you look further than that, we managed to get so much territorial gains on them with our defence, with the guys being loaded on that.\n\n\"It was a very positive outcome when we kicked. We did give them possession, but they rarely managed to do anything with it.\"\n\nTurning his attention to this weekend, De Klerk acknowledged that kicking would once again be a key component of the Bok game plan.\n\n\"It is going to be a different challenge this week (against Wales). I don\u2019t think we are going to have the same threats as that (from Japan). It\u2019s all about seeing the space, and I feel our wings have come so far over the last two years. They are really competing well in the air,\" he said.\n\n\"They (Wales) have got very good wingers, so it is going to be a massive battle in the air.\n\n\"It is going to be up to nine, 10 and 15 to decide which type of kick we are going to use, and if it\u2019s going to be off me, 10 or 15.\n\n\"We don\u2019t always go out with a set plan of me just going up and kicking. We do read the game, and listen a lot to what Handre (Pollard) is telling me.\"\n\nOn the social media attention, De Klerk acknowledge that it sometimes crossed the line.\n\n\"The players always say they try to stay away from it, and we do try. But it\u2019s impossible not to see most of the stuff that has been put out there,\" he said.\n\n\"Some things are really funny, and I enjoy some of the stuff people come up with. But also, some guys get a bit personal. It\u2019s not personally just on us or a player \u2013 people love the Springboks and are very invested in the team.\n\n\"So, if they see something go wrong or don't agree with it, it\u2019s not because they are negative, but because they are very invested. We know we have great supporting people behind us.\n\n\"When we win, they will still be happy we got the job done. We know in the camp what works for us and what doesn\u2019t. We try to listen to the coaching staff and players around us \u2013 that\u2019s probably the main thing.\n\n\"There is a nice funny picture where it says I can spin a ball and kick, so it\u2019s a spinnekop (spider).\n\n\"That was pretty funny for me to see. So, there is a lot of humour in it, and if you get caught up in that stuff, you are losing focus on what you need to do.\"\n\nThe Boks will name their team for their semi-final on Thursday.", "description": "Springbok scrumhalf Faf de Klerk has responded to some of the criticism he has received from back home.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9500/4526796c451a46d2aef7249c53afd39f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
