U.S. President Trump and North Korea's Kim meet at the start of their summit in Singapore\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Sunday that there was no way United States would bring alternative plans for their stalled nuclear talks within two weeks after negotiations in Sweden between the two countries broke down at the weekend.\n\nThe United States and North Korea were holding working-level talks in Sweden but these were broken off on Saturday. The U.S. State Department said it had accepted Sweden's invitation to return for more discussions with Pyongyang in two weeks.\n\nNorth Korea said the ball was now in Washington's court, warning again that it would only wait until the end of the year for the United States to change course.\n\n\"We have no intention to hold such sickening negotiations as ... happened this time (in Sweden) before the U.S. takes a substantial step to make complete and irreversible withdrawal of the hostile policy toward the DPRK,\" KCNA state news agency cited a spokesperson for North Korea's foreign ministry as saying, referring to the official name of North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea reiterated the year-end deadline that leader Kim Jong Un set for the United States to show more flexibility in the talks, which fell apart in February during his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nIn June, the two leaders then met again in Panmunjom, the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, and agreed to restart working-level talks.\n\nBut the North Korean foreign ministry said Washington had made no preparations for the talks in Sweden but only sought to serve its own political aims.\n\n\"The U.S. is spreading a completely ungrounded story that both sides are open to meet after two weeks...it is not likely at all that it can produce a proposal commensurate to the expectations of the DPRK and to the concerns of the world in just fortnight,\" the foreign ministry spokesperson said.", "description": "North Korea sees no way for U.S. to have alternative plans in two weeks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF950BW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
