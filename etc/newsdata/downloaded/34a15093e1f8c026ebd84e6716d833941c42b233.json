Weber said he had been exposed to the data on climate change for 30 years.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the current research and you take some interest in that, you know this: climate change is for real,\u201d Weber said. \u201cThe speed at which the environment is changing is astonishing. So needs to be the speed at which we respond to that.\u201d\n\nThe UBS chairman\u2019s comments came at UBS's first ever ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) and Sustainability Symposium in London on Monday. Weber opened the conference via a live video link from Switzerland.\n\nWeber called on investors and finance professionals to overhaul financial markets and investment processes to make tackling climate change a key priority.\n\nREAD MORE: UK government tells banks to go green in anti-carbon push\n\n\u201cFinancial markets are enormously effective in moving capital where it is needed most,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how can financial markets be moved to mobilising capital and aligning capital allocations more strongly with sustainability?\n\n\u201cDuring the financial crisis and before, and in its aftermath, finance has been part of the problem. We need to do what we can do best \u2014 that is financial engineering, financial plumbing \u2014 to become a force for good.\u201d\n\nCoal-fired power plants produce a lot of greenhouse gas emissions.

There will be technology breakthroughs it\u2019s just a question of when it\u2019s going to happen.\n\n\u201cYou have it within your wherewithal to invest in some of these things,\u201d Dr Zuber told the audience of UBS clients.\n\nSustainable investment aimed at decreasing the impact of climate change has become a major subject within global finance in recent years. A \u201cGreen Finance Strategy\u201d was launched by the UK government earlier this year and the Bank of England will begin climate stress tests in 2021. The tests will examine how banks would cope with climate risks such as the banning of carbon-based fuels or increased flooding in certain areas.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOscar Williams-Grut covers banking, fintech, and finance for Yahoo Finance UK.
