Reed Albergotti describes Apple\u2019s dual role in the app economy. And Lena Sun breaks down the chemical linked to recent vaping-related illnesses and deaths.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nThe brewing tensions that led to John Bolton\u2019s departure\n\nPresident Trump announced on Tuesday that he had fired John Bolton, his third national security adviser since taking office. The message came after months of disagreement between Bolton and members of the administration over how to handle major foreign policy challenges such as North Korea and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two men offered different accounts of the ouster. Bolton responded to the president\u2019s announcement with a rebuttal tweet and told The Post: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, I resigned, having offered to do so last night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re turning the page on the Bolton era, which advocated for the most aggressive possible responses to America\u2019s adversaries,\u201d says national security reporter John Hudson . \u201cWho comes next is a big open-ended question.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump said in a tweet that he would name a replacement next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when Apple copies popular app ideas\n\nApp developers have come to accept that, without warning, Apple can make their work obsolete by announcing new features that use or incorporate their ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome developers have buckled under the pressure, in some cases opting to shut down instead of facing a protracted battle with the tech giant whose platform they depend on. The imbalance of power reflects the industry\u2019s long history of imitation and the platform\u2019s access to a trove of data no one else has, says tech reporter Reed Albergotti\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nVaping-related illnesses are on the rise, health officials warn\n\nAmid a surge of cases that have left five people dead and 450 potentially affected, state and federal health officials have linked a mysterious lung illness to vaping.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile no specific e-cigarette products have been linked to the disorder, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that a chemical exposure is probably associated with the illness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAdvocates say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s safer than smoking a regular cigarette because there\u2019s not all that tar,\u2019 \u201d says health reporter Lena H. Sun . \u201cBut nobody has really looked deeply or researched the long-term health effects of inhaling all this other stuff into your lungs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "John Hudson on the ouster of national security adviser John Bolton.
