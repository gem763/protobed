Some are increasingly focusing their fury on mainland Chinese in the city.\n\nChina denies meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nLam said she expected negative economic growth in the Asian financial hub this year, in part as a result of the unrest.\n\n\"The increasingly violent reality since June is hurting Hong Kong's economy,\" Lam said in a speech on Wednesday. \"...what started off as peaceful protests, a hallmark of Hong Kong's rights and freedoms, have turned into violent acts by rioters.\"\n\nWith visitors deterred by months of violence, many small firms across the city have already closed or are struggling to turn a profit.\n\nLam's gloomy forecast came two days after Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had slipped into a technical recession, meaning two successive quarters of contraction. That is expected to be confirmed by Thursday's third-quarter GDP data.\n\nThe protests, which started over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades and also pose the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
