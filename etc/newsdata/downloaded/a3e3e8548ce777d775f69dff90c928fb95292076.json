But depending on the report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Comey may not be traveling anywhere at all. The Department of Justice announced last week that it was opening a criminal investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nAt Politicon 2019 in Nashville on Saturday, during a \u201cconversation\u201d with Never Trumper MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, Comey said, \u201cOur leaders must reflect the glue that holds us together.
