Given that the game was 7-1 those missed calls really had nothing to do with the outcome, but they were pretty notable.\n\nBut not as notable as one particular missed call that, it seems anyway, was not a function of Barksdale not being able to properly ascertain the difference between a ball and a strike. Rather, it was because he apparently thought Nationals catcher Yan Gomes was showing him up.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nDuring the sixth inning, Nats pitcher Tanner Rainey threw a pitch to Astros outfielder Michael Brantley that pretty clearly caught the bottom corner and should\u2019ve been strike three. Gomes, as a lot of catchers do when they know their pitcher made their pitch, caught it, bounced up and headed for the dugout. Barksdale called it a ball, however.\n\nWhy? Because, Barksdale said, \u201cyou were taking off on me,\u201d suggesting that he called it a ball because Gomes got out of his crouch assuming the strike call, which Barksdale thought was disrespectful. Gomes immediately got Barksdale\u2019s drift and said, \u201coh, it\u2019s my fault?\u201d Which I imagine might\u2019ve gotten him run out of the game if it wasn\u2019t October, but here we are:\n\nUmp doesn't call strike three. Tells Gomes he was taking off on him. Gomes replies 'Oh it's my fault?\" Then Martinez kindly asks the up to wake up because its the World Series. pic.twitter.com/iRUr349bQh \u2014 Jomboy (@Jomboy_) October 28, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nAn umpire missing a call because he\u2019s bad at telling a ball from a strike is not great, but at least it\u2019s just a mistake. An umpire blaming a missed call on the catcher \u2014 with the implication that, perhaps, he might\u2019ve called it differently if his feelings weren\u2019t hurt \u2014 is another thing altogether.\n\nUmpires are gonna be upset if and when they\u2019re replaced with automated systems to call balls and strikes. But they\u2019ll be at least partially to blame if it happens.", "description": "He turned a strike into a ball because he thought the catcher was showing him up", "authors": ["Craig Calcaterra"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BK1taD.OuqveF1UVoblzPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/87D1Q_p8tEHxFMHQ4hPIUg--~B/aD0xMDgxO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/dbdc8160535a6bbfa99a51d7cd5faf34", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
