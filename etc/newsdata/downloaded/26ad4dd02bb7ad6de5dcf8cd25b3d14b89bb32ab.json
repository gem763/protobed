That\u2019s Irrational.", "language": "en", "text": "Trump is looking for love in all the wrong places (specifically, in places where he already has it).

The first 33 months of his presidency have done little to discredit that hypothesis.\n\nThe president promised his base that a Trump administration would bring them a border-spanning wall financed by Mexico, a vastly reduced trade deficit, a balanced budget, and tax reforms that benefited the middle-class but \u201cnot the wealthy and well-connected.\u201d Instead, he has delivered massive tax breaks for the one percent, a historic increase in the national debt, higher trade deficits, and \u2014 if all goes right \u2014 a few hundred miles of border fencing financed by raiding funds that had been earmarked for U.S. troops.\n\nNone of these broken promises \u2014 nor any of Trump\u2019s forays into naked corruption, neo-Nazi apologia, FBI bashing, or mass child torture \u2014 has shaken the GOP base\u2019s faith in its standard-bearer. The president commands a historically robust approval rating among Republican voters.\n\nHis standing with the rest of the electorate is another story. Despite presiding over the tightest labor market in decades, Trump has won few converts \u2014 and bled no small number of marginal supporters \u2014 since taking up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. His approval rating currently sits at just over 41 percent. That lackluster figure may have been sufficient in 2016, when Trump\u2019s Democratic rival was historically unpopular, and the GOP nominee managed to win voters who disliked both candidates by double digits. But recent polling suggests he won\u2019t be so lucky the next time round. A Fox News survey released last month found that, in a hypothetical general election between Trump and Joe Biden, voters who disliked both men broke for the former vice-president by 33 points.\n\nGiven this landscape, a rational president would be scrounging for ways to broaden his appeal through triangulation on a high-salience issue. And in recent weeks, Republican donors and pollsters have tried to gently steer the president toward one such opportunity.\n\nIn late August, the GOP-aligned firm Public Opinion Strategies conducted a survey to discern how various gun-safety measures polled with female voters in five heavily suburban swing congressional districts. They found that 90 percent of such voters, including 85 percent of those who identified as independents, supported requiring universal background checks for gun purchases. Critically, support for gun reform was not merely broad but deep: After the summer\u2019s spate of mass shootings, independent women voters in these battleground districts ranked gun reform as the most important issue facing their country.\n\nThe behavior of Republican lawmakers and donors in recent weeks lends credibility to these results. Several of the latter warned their party that inaction on gun safety put them at risk of \u201cextinction in the suburbs,\u201d where the party had suffered massive losses during the 2018 midterms. Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, signaled that he was prepared to rally his caucus behind whichever gun reforms the president was prepared to support.\n\nIn the wake of the mass murders in El Paso and Dayton last month, Trump vowed to implement \u201cvery meaningful background checks.\u201d But that resolve quickly dissipated. And on Friday, the New York Times got wind of his reasoning:\n\nInside the White House, the issue of new gun control measures has largely been theoretical. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has cautioned that it will be the president who will have to press his party to act. To help guide Mr. Trump\u2019s decision-making, White House aides commissioned a poll to determine where his supporters stood on different measures \u2026 [T]he polling data, White House aides said, indicated that the issue does not help the president with his core base of supporters, according to the people briefed on the meeting.\n\nIf this report is accurate, then the administration has taken a wildly irrational approach to assessing its own political self-interest on gun policy. Why would the White House be primarily concerned with whether gun reform would \u201chelp the president with his core base of supporters\u201d \u2014 who, by definition, are the voters the president needs the least \u201chelp\u201d with? Surely, \u201cWill this be enough to make meaningful inroads with swing voters?\u201d is a more relevant question here than \u201cWould passing new gun regulations make the GOP base even more pro-Trump than it is already?\u201d\n\nOf course, it isn\u2019t wholly irrational for a president with a small base of support to evince some concern for retaining his supporters\u2019 enthusiasm. But if Trump could persuade his base that raiding the Pentagon\u2019s budget to build some border fencing is tantamount to building a wall on Mexico\u2019s dime, it\u2019s hard to see how he couldn\u2019t get them to swallow modest gun reforms that poll quite well with Republicans writ large in public surveys. The president might take some heat from corners of conservative talk radio. But is there any real question that the far-right infotainment complex will be with him when it counts? If Trump signs universal background checks into law this fall, will that really stop Hannity and Limbaugh from spending next summer hyperventilating about how the election of a Democratic president will mark the end of America as we\u2019ve known it? Given the stability of the GOP base\u2019s support for Trump, and the reliability of conservative media to back the Republican standard-bearer in campaign season, there\u2019s simply no rational basis for the president to prioritize his core supporters\u2019 views on gun reform over those of independent female voters in purple suburbs.\n\nThe most plausible explanation for why Trump is setting such a priority anyway is that his White House is staffed almost entirely by conservative-movement ideologues \u2014 and those ideologues have discerned that the best way to prevent their opportunistic boss from straying toward the center is to exploit his deep fear of losing the love of his superfans.\n\nEvery time Trump flirted with striking a compromise on immigration in his presidency\u2019s early going, Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller put the fear of the Trumpen proletariat in their boss. And the Times\u2019 reporting suggests that the advisers who are counseling the president on the politics of gun reform may not be entirely impartial: According to the paper, Trump\u2019s commitment to background checks \u201cappeared to soften amid concerns from the National Rifle Association and some of his closest advisers.\u201d\n\nBeing ruled by a gullible narcissist whose fragile ego makes him easy prey for his coterie of extremist advisers is less than ideal. But a reactionary president who had the capacity to recognize his own political interest \u2014 and a team of advisers monomaniacally focused on helping him pursue that interest \u2014 would probably be even more dangerous.", "description": "President Trump is backing away from a proposal to expand gun background checks after White House polling showed that such a policy would \u201cnot help the president with his core base of supporters.\u201d But those aren\u2019t the voters Trump needs help with.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/06/trump-nra.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
