REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo\n\nThrown into crisis by a chain of events that started with activist fund Elliott [ECAL.UL] taking a stake last year, Thyssenkrupp is desperately trying to improve its operating performance and simplify its overly complex structure.\n\nTo do that, it is planning to list or sell its elevator division and is willing to sell majority stakes in its struggling car parts and plant engineering divisions, which Merz said are facing significant changes.\n\n\u201cIt is true that this will not be possible without significant job cuts,\u201d Merz said in the memo seen by Reuters. \u201cThis is about strengthening businesses and improving performance. This is not a sellout.\u201d\n\nHer remarks come about a week after she dropped her chairman mandate and took over as CEO, replacing Guido Kerkhoff, whose efforts to implement the turnaround were seen as too slow and lacking determination.\n\nThyssenkrupp previously said it would cut 6,000 of the group\u2019s 162,000 jobs, a step seen by sources familiar with the matter as insufficient to improve the group\u2019s cost structure. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), for example, has announced 18,000 cuts, out of a total of 92,000 jobs.\n\nMerz said she would give a general update on the group\u2019s new organizational structure at the end of November and that employees would have clarity in early 2020. \u201cWe will do this in a fair and transparent way,\u201d she said.\n\nMerz said some of Thyssenkrupp\u2019s business areas would shed organizational layers, which has led to the resignation of Marcel Fasswald, head of Thyssenkrupp\u2019s Industrial Solutions division, which will be renamed Plant Technology.\n\nAs part of the revamp, the company\u2019s Components Technology division, which builds car parts and has faced margin pressure due to a global downturn in the industry, will be renamed Automotive Technology.\n\nMerz remained tight-lipped on the ongoing auction process for Thyssenkrupp\u2019s elevator division, only confirming that preparations for a listing were ongoing while offers made by potential bidders were being examined.\n\nSources told Reuters a day earlier that Thyssenkrupp was planning to give potential bidders access to the data room of its elevator division in the coming days.", "description": "New Thyssenkrupp chief executive Martina Merz on Wednesday paved the way for deeper job cuts at the ailing conglomerate, telling employees in an internal memo such a step was necessary for a much-needed turnaround.", "authors": ["Tom K\u00e4ckenhoff", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438746003&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980GZ", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
