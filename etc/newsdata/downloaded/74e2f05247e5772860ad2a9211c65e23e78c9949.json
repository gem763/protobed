He pointed out that expansion in the service sector \u2013 which provided the biggest positive contribution to GDP growth \u2013 followed four months of flat-lining output and said businesses may be bringing activity forward ahead of the October Brexit deadline.\n\nA rise in manufacturing in July may also have been driven by stockpiling ahead of the deadline, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts said much will depend on the outcome of Brexit, as well as a weakening global economy which poses the greatest risks to UK manufacturers.\n\nA disorderly departure from the EU could tip Britain into recession, said PwC chief economist John Hawksworth, echoing forecasts by KPMG. The firm said earlier on Monday that a no-deal Brexit could lead to a 1.5 per cent fall in Britain\u2019s GDP next year, while a deal would result in growth of the same magnitude.\n\nMr Hawksworth also pointed out a third scenario: \u201cIf there is a prolonged period of political limbo with no clear resolution of the Brexit issue, then businesses could continue to defer major investment decisions, causing the UK economy to continue to stall.\"\n\nSeparate figures from the ONS showed that UK trade deficit narrowed in the three months to July, largely as a result of falling imports of goods.", "description": "Britain\u2019s economy expanded in July at the fastest pace since January, easing recession fears, although the longer-term trend remained weak.
