But for some people drowning in debt or struggling with other seemingly insurmountable financial woes, persuading the IRS to accept a compromise offer may not be as hopeless as it seems.\n\nWhile the IRS isn\u2019t known for its generosity, it is authorized by law to compromise under certain circumstances. For example, the IRS \u201cgenerally\u201d will accept a compromise offer \u201cwhen the amount offered represents the most we can expect to collect within a reasonable period,\u201d says Eric Smith, an IRS spokesman. A compromise is a possibility if \u201cyou can\u2019t pay your full tax liability, or doing so creates a financial hardship,\u201d the IRS says on its website.\n\nBut getting to \u201cyes\u201d can be stunningly complicated and time-consuming. Filling out the application, collecting documentation and waiting for an IRS response can require extraordinary patience. \u201cIt\u2019s typically a long haul due to the unfortunate underfunding of the IRS by Congress and the process the examiners must go through to analyze each offer,\u201d says Fran Obeid, an attorney at MFO Law, P.C., in New York City.\n\nCritics say the IRS could make the program more user-friendly, including responding more quickly to offers and being less stingy. The IRS has said that determining someone\u2019s \u201creasonable collection potential\u201d is a \u201ccomplex and nuanced topic,\u201d and that it has made improvements, including posting more information on its website. Officials also say they are reviewing the subject and will consider changes based on the findings.\n\nHere are answers to some questions readers may have.\n\nHow many compromise offers does the IRS receive in a typical year, and how many are accepted?\n\nDuring the year ended Sept. 30, 2018, the IRS accepted about 24,000 offers out of 59,000 received, Mr. Smith says. Those numbers, which include individual taxpayers and businesses, are \u201cfairly typical\u201d of data in recent years, he says. They don\u2019t reflect offers that the IRS returned to taxpayers because more information was required, or other reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult\u201d to get a compromise approved, says Russell Schneidewind, lead tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H&R Block. \u201cThis program isn\u2019t for everyone.\u201d The dollar amount of accepted offers totaled $261.3 million in 2018.\n\nIs there an online tool that can help me decide whether I might qualify?\n\nTry the IRS\u2019s Offer in Compromise Pre-Qualifier.\n\nBefore applying and begging for mercy, be sure to \u201cexplore all other payments options,\u201d such as an installment agreement, the IRS says. Taxpayers who can pay everything they owe through installments, or some other way, \u201cgenerally won\u2019t qualify\u201d for a compromise \u201cin most cases,\u201d the IRS says.\n\nA few other suggestions:\n\n\u2022 Make sure you are up-to-date with all required tax filings, as well as any required estimated tax payments. Many people aren\u2019t aware of these requirements, says Eric L. Green, a lawyer at Green & Sklarz LLC.\n\n\u2022 You aren\u2019t eligible if you are in \u201can open bankruptcy proceeding,\u201d the IRS says on its website.\n\nFor more information, type \u201coffer in compromise\u201d in the search box on the IRS website. The IRS recently posted a revised compromise application package that reflects a recently enacted law, Mr. Smith says. \u201cNormally, an offer in compromise requires a $186 application fee to cover the cost of processing,\u201d he says. But \u201cmany low-and-moderate income taxpayers qualify for waiver\u201d of that fee. Other sources include IRS Tax Topic Number 204, a general publication on the topic and IRS answers to frequently asked questions.\n\nHow long does it take for the IRS to reply?\n\nIt depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. \u201cI usually tell clients to plan on a year from start to finish,\u201d says Mr. Green. \u201cI\u2019ve had clients tell me \u2018I want to sell my house in two months.\u2019 I say \u2018that\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith of the IRS says most offers are processed \u201cwithin a year, though there are obviously some that take longer.\u201d\n\n59,000 Compromise offers IRS received for the year ended Sept. 30, 2018 24,000 Compromise offers IRS accepted for the year ended Sept. 30, 2018 $261.3 million Total amount of accepted offers in 2018\n\nWill I need to seek professional help?\n\nThat also depends on your case\u2019s complexity and how much time you want to spend. But if you\u2019re thinking of hiring pros, check their credentials and experience carefully. Beware of \u201cunscrupulous promoters\u201d who \u201cpromise unrealistic results\u201d and charge \u201cexcessive fees to taxpayers who have no chance of meeting the program\u2019s requirements,\u201d the IRS spokesman says.\n\nIs it possible to get a compromise accepted if my assets and income exceed the tax liability?\n\nSometimes. For example, the IRS may accept a compromise based on \u201ceffective tax administration.\u201d That refers to a case \u201cwhen there is no doubt that the tax is legally owed and that the full amount owed can be collected, but requiring payment in full would either create an economic hardship or would be unfair and inequitable because of exceptional circumstances.\u201d Another category: \u201cdoubt as to liability,\u201d which means \u201cthere\u2019s a genuine dispute as to the existence or amount of the correct tax debt under the law,\u201d the IRS website says.\n\nWhat can happen if a taxpayer submits an offer that isn\u2019t truthful, such as not disclosing assets or income?\n\nVery bad idea, warns Mr. Green. \u201cThat kind of case can go criminal,\u201d he says. The IRS says it reviews offers for \u201cpossible fraudulent intent.\u201d On its website, the IRS warns: \u201cSubmitting an OIC with false information, or making a false statement to an IRS employee, is considered fraud and may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\u201d\n\nMr. Herman is a writer in New York City.
