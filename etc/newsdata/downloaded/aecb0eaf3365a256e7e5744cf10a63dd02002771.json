Two of the patients died.\n\nBut they represent only a small fraction of the more than 800 lung injury cases reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as being associated with electronic cigarette use, or vaping, over the past few months.\n\nThere have been 12 deaths, according to the latest figures from the CDC published last week.\n\nHealth authorities have been investigating the cause of the outbreak, which has mainly affected young males, since July.\n\nMore than three-quarters of those affected reported using products containing THC -- tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nTHC is cut using other additives like solvents and flavors so it can be heated and inhaled with a vaping device. Investigators are hoping to resolve which of these substances could be causing the lung ailments.", "description": "Lung biopsies from 17 people affected by a US outbreak of severe pulmonary disease linked to vaping have revealed the injuries are consistent with exposure to noxious chemical fumes, scientists reported Wednesday.
