Rather than being structured like an onion with concentric rings, the dust ended up more resembling a 'badly-baked cherry cake', said Professor McCoustra\n\n'We are refining our model of how space dust grows and have, through a combination of observation and computer simulation, developed a yet-to-be-proven hypothesis,' said Professor McCoustra.\n\n'Aspects of this complex process still need more detailed exploration, particularly the role of cosmic rays and ultraviolet light in driving non-thermal processes on and in the icy grain mantles.'\n\nThe team hope that other researchers will test out their ideas and help advance our understanding of how our universe is built up.\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal ACS Earth and Space Chemistry.", "description": "Chemical physicists at the\u00a0Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh recreated deep space in their lab.
