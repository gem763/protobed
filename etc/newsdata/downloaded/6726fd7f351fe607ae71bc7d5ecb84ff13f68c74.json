No US personnel were killed in the operation but one service dog was hurt by the explosion.\n\n\"The disposal of his [al-Baghdadi's] remains has been done and is complete and was handled appropriately,\" Milley told the briefing in the Pentagon, adding that Washington had no plans to release photos or videos of his death at this time.\n\nA US official told Reuters news agency that al-Baghdadi had been given a burial at sea and afforded religious rites according to Islamic custom. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not disclose further details, including how or where the ritual was performed.\n\nCiting unnamed Pentagon sources, AFP news agency also reported al-Baghdadi's body was disposed of at sea.\n\nAl Jazeera's Kimberley Halkett, reporting from Washington, DC, meanwhile said the briefing had provided a \"more substantive update\" on the operation against the ISIL leader after Trump had done a \"victory lap\" over the 48-year-old's death.\n\nAl-Baghdadi had long been a target for the US and regional security forces trying to eliminate ISIL even after the armed group was pushed out of the vast swathes of territory it once held across Iraq and Syria.\n\nEsper, for his part, said al-Baghdadi's death had deprived ISIL of its \"inspirational leader\", but warned the security situation in Syria \"remains complex\".\n\nHe added that US troops were in position to retain control of key oil fields in Syria's northeast in a bid to deny ISIL access to them.", "description": "US troops took two men captive during operation against ISIL leader in Syria's Idlib province, defence official says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/c901ddc805de47859532a4a316bf0d1c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
