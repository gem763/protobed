Sign up here.\n\nSixteen people have been sentenced to death for the murder of 18-year-old student Nusrat Jahan Rafi, who was set on fire after refusing to withdraw a complaint that one of her teachers was sexually harassing her.\n\nAmong those convicted were two female classmates as well as the principal of the Islamic college, who Rafi accused of touching her inappropriately in his office.\n\nRafi\u2019s murder in April shocked the country and led to mass protests calling for the killers to be brought to justice. Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met with Rafi\u2019s family and promised to prosecute all those involved.\n\nThere were angry scenes in the courtroom on Thursday, which was packed with the victim\u2019s family and friends. While they welcomed the outcome, Rafi\u2019s family say they are still in fear of their lives.\n\nRafi\u2019s brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman, told reporters the defendants had publicly threatened him in the courtroom. \u201cI am very afraid. I am urging the prime minister to ensure our security. And the police super should also keep a track on our wellbeing.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the defendants indicated they will appeal the ruling. Twelve of the defendants confessed, according to the prosecutor.\n\nRafi, who lived in Feni, a small town about 100 miles outside the capital Dhaka, said she was summoned by her principal Siraj Ud Doula on March 27.\n\n\n\nThe 18-year-old told police that he repeatedly touched her in an inappropriate manner before she fled. A young woman making such an accusation against a man in a position of power is very uncommon in Bangladesh, and rights groups have said that the prevalence of sex crimes in the country is much higher than reported.\n\nThe police arrested Doula but prosecutors say he and another teacher, together with local leaders of the ruling Awami League party \u2014 who were also among the 16 convicted on Thursday \u2014 ordered students to carry out the killing.\n\nOn April 6, against the wishes of her family, Rafi returned to school for an exam. A female classmate asked Rafi to come to the roof of the school where she said another classmate was being beaten up.\n\nRafi said that when she got to the roof she was surrounded by five people wearing burkas who pressured her into withdrawing her statement. When she refused to back down, her attackers held her down, tied her hands, and poured kerosene over her before setting her on fire.\n\nRafi was rushed to a local hospital where doctors found burns over 80 percent of her body. She was able to record a statement about the attack on her brother\u2019s mobile phone while she was in the ambulance.\n\nRafi died four days later.\n\nCover: In this photo taken on April 12, 2019, Bangladeshi women hold placards and photographs of schoolgirl Nusrat Jahan Rafi at a protest in Dhaka, following her murder by being set on fire after she had reported a sexual assault.
