Can he make the see-saw balance?\n\nHe seems to have the votes he needs in the Commons. This may seem surprising, given that he has expelled 21 MPs from the parliamentary Conservative party, and upset Labour MPs with his insensitive comments about their safety.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

We start with the third and final vote on Theresa May\u2019s deal on 29 March, when she was 30 votes short of the majority she needed.\n\nSince then, the Conservatives have lost one seat to the Liberal Democrats \u2013 in the Brecon & Radnorshire by-election. That means, if all the MPs who voted for May\u2019s deal would vote for Johnson\u2019s deal, he needs 31 MPs who refused to vote for hers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In particular, what about the MPs who had the Tory whip removed? Of the 21, 16 voted for May\u2019s deal. The other five voted against, because they are opposed to any form of Brexit. I assume they will vote against any deal Johnson can negotiate \u2013 and that includes his brother Jo Johnson, now that he is not in government. One of them \u2013 Sam Gyimah \u2013 has joined the Liberal Democrats, joining Phillip Lee, another EU supporter who voted against May\u2019s deal and who defected before he could be expelled.\n\nAnd I assume the 15 who voted for the deal will vote for Johnson\u2019s version, along with Amber Rudd, who resigned the whip voluntarily. Several of them \u2013 Alistair Burt, David Gauke, Greg Clark, Steve Brine and Stephen Hammond \u2013 asked supportive, or at least not hostile, questions when the prime minister made his statement in parliament yesterday. I assume that, if there is a deal and they vote for it, they would have the whip restored.\n\nSo where would Johnson get 31 extra votes from? He starts with 10 of the Democratic Unionist Party, which has surprisingly welcomed the proposal, despite it retaining the harder regulatory border in the Irish Sea from May\u2019s deal. There are suggestions that not all 10 are on board with the leadership line, but none has broken cover yet.\n\nThen there are the 28 Tory Eurosceptic MPs who voted against May\u2019s deal. Four of them now have government jobs, including Priti Patel and Theresa Villiers. Two others supported his proposal in the Commons yesterday \u2013 Mark Francois and Steve Baker \u2013 while two more spoke without revealing their intentions \u2013 Bill Cash and Peter Bone.\n\nMy guess is that almost all of them will back a deal if the DUP does.\n\nAnd Johnson has a cushion, in the form of 12 Labour MPs and one Lib Dem (Norman Lamb), who didn\u2019t vote for May\u2019s deal but who are prepared to vote for a new deal in order to avoid further delay. Of the 12, Stephen Kinnock, Ruth Smeeth and Gareth Snell have already indicated that they were not deterred by the prime minister\u2019s controversial comments last week. \u201cIf Dublin and Brussels are happy, then we\u2019re happy,\u201d said Kinnock.\n\nIf we assume that eight of the 28 Tory \u201cSpartans\u201d refuse to vote for a new deal, along with Sylvia Hermon, the independent Northern Ireland unionist, who has sounded unhappy with the proposal, and perhaps half of the Labour \u201cMPs for a Deal\u201d group \u2013 then Johnson would have 36 more votes than May did.\n\nIn other words, he would clear the fence by six votes. In a full turnout in the Commons, he would have a majority of 11. That is not exactly the \u201cpretty solid majority\u201d of which Michael Gove spoke on Wednesday, but it is certainly winnable.\n\nThe problem is that, during the negotiations, if there are any, Johnson will have to make concessions \u2013 the see-saw will tip back and the numbers in the Commons might change again.", "description": "The Brexit see-saw is that if a deal is acceptable to the EU, it will be defeated in the House of Commons; and if there are the votes for a proposal in the Commons, it will be unacceptable to the EU.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/22/boris-parliament-supreme-court.jpg"}
