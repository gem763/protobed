I find that the global equity markets may face a tough time if, there is a hard Brexit\u2014meaning leaving without a deal\u2014could have severe repercussions for global risk markets.\n\nNo doubt that the showed a bumping move during the last week along with global equity markets amid growing hopes over normal Brexit deal; but if there would be hard Brexit, Nifty 50 may see a nose dive move on October 22nd, 2019. I find that if the Nifty 50 starts the Tuesday\u2019s trading session with a gap-down opening, the volatile move will follow the exhaustive move; because every upward move may find heavy sell-off.\n\nModi-Trump Trade Deal\n\nAfter a long silence over the trade deal between the India\u2019s Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi and the U.S. President Mr. Donald Trump on September 23rd, 2019, when Nifty 50 witnessed a bouncing move; India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday that the broad contours of a trade deal with the United States have been worked out and suggested there could be an announcement soon. No doubt this may pop-up some strength in Indian equity markets, amid globally prevailing fear of economic slowdown will result in steep downward moves.\n\nSino-U.S. Tariff Trade Deal\n\nI find that despite of the plethora of promises, made during these formal meets; look evident enough to extend exhaustion in global equity markets as same as the Sino-U.S. tariff trade issue turned in to tussle in October 2018; and continue to damage global economies. No doubt that during the formal meets between the two major economies of the world, only partial deal remained the final outcome, which may enhance the current uncertainty for even longer duration in near future; as China has started to look towards India as one of the major destinations to keep its own economy after locking its final deal on Sino-U.S. front.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the steady Gold futures around $1500 look evident enough to show the quantum of prevailing weakness in global equity markets; which may extend exhaustion any time as the global equity markets still tend to face sharp volatile moves till November 17th, 2019.
