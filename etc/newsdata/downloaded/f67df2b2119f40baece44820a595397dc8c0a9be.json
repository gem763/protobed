The future of women\u2019s tennis will be on show for the next eight days as the best eight players of 2019 contest the Shiseido WTA Finals here in one of the Far East\u2019s most dynamic cities.\n\nThe year-end tournament is being held in China for the first time in its 48-year history and, fittingly enough, the field reflects the changing times in the sport. The average age of the players is just 24, with 29-year-old Petra Kvitova and 28-year-old Simona Halep the two oldest in the line-up.\n\nWith Serena Williams failing to finish in the world\u2019s top eight \u2013 though it was by no means certain that she would have chosen to play here even if she had qualified \u2013 the tournament is being seen by many as a shoot-out between three young players who have lit up the year with their triumphs at Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNaomi Osaka, aged 22, won her second successive Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, 23-year-old Ashleigh Barty claimed her first at the French Open in June and 19-year-old Bianca Andreescu, who had begun the year ranked outside the world\u2019s top 150, crowned a remarkable campaign by winning last month\u2019s US Open. Osaka made her debut in this tournament last year, while Barty has only ever played in the doubles event and Andreescu will be making her first appearance.\n\nOsaka will open proceedings on Sunday when she takes on Kvitova in a rematch of their Australian Open final, with Barty facing Belinda Bencic in the other match in the round-robin Red Group. The Purple Group, which might provide an easier route to the semi-finals, brings together Andreescu, Halep, Karolina Pliskova and Elina Svitolina, who is the defending champion. The top two in each group proceed to the last four.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 17 of Serena Williams\u2019 most empowering quotes Show all 17 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Getty Images for The Met Museum/ 4/17 On learning from losses 'I don\u2019t like to lose \u2013 at anything\u2026 Yet I\u2019ve grown most not from victories, but setbacks. If winning is God\u2019s reward, then losing is how he teaches us.' Getty Images 5/17 On making sacrifices 'Everything comes at a cost. Just what are you willing to pay for it?' Getty Images 6/17 On the sweetness of victory 'Victory is very, very sweet. It tastes better than any dessert you\u2019ve ever had.' Getty Images 7/17 On being dubbed the greatest 'Am I the greatest?

That\u2019s what I do in life, when I get down, when I get sick, I don\u2019t want to just stop. I keep going and I try to do more.

I\u2019m really excited to have an opportunity now after a fantastic year to try and finish really well.\u201d\n\nKvitova, who pointed out that she had won this tournament at the age of 21 on her debut in 2011, admitted that it felt \u201cpretty weird\u201d to be the oldest player in the field and said that she and Halep had joked about being the veterans. \u201cThe new faces are coming,\u201d Kvitova said. \u201cIt\u2019s normal that the generations are changing.\u201d\n\nHalep, who is back working with her coach Darren Cahill after he took off the rest of the year for family reasons, said the younger players had done \u201ca fantastic job\u201d to win Grand Slam titles and said they provided a major challenge to the older players.\n\n\u201cTennis is growing up, tennis is going ahead, so we have to adjust ourselves to everything that's new,\u201d Halep said. \u201cThings have changed. The young players now have more courage. They have open minds. They have more power than players had 10 years ago. It feels like when they play the big players they are not as nervous as we were. I think it's a big plus for them. That's why we have more young players in the top 10.\u201d\n\nAndreescu meanwhile insisted that age \u201cis just a number\u201d. She added: \u201cI think anyone can accomplish anything at any age if they really want it. I think I proved that. Petra proved that. Serena proved that. Right now I don't think I have much pressure on my shoulders going into this tournament. It's my first WTA Finals. I know I'm coming off a really good year this year, but I'm just going to go out there like any other tournament.\u201d\n\nOsaka, meanwhile, revealed that after parting company with two coaches this year she would be working here with her father. \u201cIt seems to be working so far,\u201d she said before adding with a smile: \u201cLet's see if I fire him.\"\n\nShenzhen will be the home of this tournament for the next 10 years. Just half an hour\u2019s ferry ride from Hong Kong, it is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities. Forty years ago it was just a small fishing village, but today it is a major centre for high-tech industry and has a population of more than 12 million. The tournament, which also features the eight most successful doubles teams of the year, is staged at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center, a huge sports complex near the waterfront.\n\nA total of $14m (about \u00a310.9m) in prize money is at stake, with the eventual champion winning between $4.1m (\u00a33.2m) and $4.7m (\u00a33.7m), depending on their results in the round-robin matches. That will make it the biggest ever pay cheque awarded in men\u2019s or women\u2019s tennis, beating the $3.85m (\u00a33m) won by both Andreescu and Rafael Nadal at last month\u2019s US Open. Meanwhile even players who lose all their group matches are guaranteed to take home $385,000 (\u00a3300,000).\n\nWith such huge prize money on offer, every match is expected to be highly competitive. \u201cIn my opinion, I don't think there is a favourite,\u201d Barty said. \u201cEveryone has earned their place here and on any given day anyone can be beaten.\u201d", "description": "New venue, new generation, new era.
