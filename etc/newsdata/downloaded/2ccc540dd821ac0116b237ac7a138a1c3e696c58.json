REUTERS/Dario Ayala\n\nMontreal-based SNC completed the sale of the stake in August to Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) for C$3.25 billion ($2.47 billion), in a deal that cannot be reversed on appeal, the construction and engineering firm said.\n\nCintra Global S.E. has given notice to the Court of Appeal for the Canadian province of Ontario that it will appeal the August ruling, the source said on condition of anonymity, in an effort to acquire shares from CPPIB.\n\nCintra, already a shareholder in Canada\u2019s Highway 407 toll road operator, had argued it had a right of first refusal and should be allowed to buy up to 5.2% of the stake put up for sale by SNC.\n\nThe three companies had agreed in August that if the court\u2019s decision were reversed on appeal, CPPIB and Cintra would adjust \u201cthe relevant number of shares of Highway 407\u201d between them.\n\nCintra declined to comment.\n\nAn SNC spokeswoman confirmed Cintra was appealing the Ontario Superior Court decision, but said that it \u201chas no impact\u201d on the company.\n\nThe closely watched sale was aimed at paying down SNC\u2019s debt at a time when the engineering and construction firm is restructuring its business, after wrestling with higher-than-expected expenses in its main unit.\n\nSNC-Lavalin still has a 6.76% stake in Highway 407.\n\nSNC stock closed up more than 12% on Tuesday to C$17.92 a share, after brokerage CIBC said it would resume coverage and set a price target of C$25.\n\n($1 = 1.3142 Canadian dollars)", "description": "A unit of Spain's Ferrovial S.A. is appealing a Canadian court decision over SNC Lavalin Group Inc's former 10.01% stake in a toll highway, a source and the Montreal-based company told Reuters on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428457882&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8924S-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
