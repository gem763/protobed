The first totally legal, just a matter of good scouting. Hitters might get an idea from the angle of the pitcher\u2019s glove or the wiggle of his wrist.\n\n\u201cIf you, as a pitcher, show something different to the hitters, as professional hitters, they\u2019re going to take advantage of that,\u201d said Nationals right-hander An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, who nearly threw a no-hitter in the NL Championship Series opener at St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s no doubt.\u201d\n\nOn sign stealing, legality can get blurrier. A runner on second base has a clear view of the catcher\u2019s signals, and there\u2019s no rule against taking a peek and discretely relaying that info to the batter - although the opposing battery might still take issue. That\u2019s a practice old as Cracker Jacks.\n\nSmart devices and other fresh tech have opened another frontier for potential pilferers. Even before alarms were sounded in Cleveland and Boston last fall about the Astros\u2019 man with a phone, paranoia about cameras, Apple Watches and other devices has made intricate signaling a full-time practice.\n\nSign sequences have become dizzying, and Reds catcher Tucker Barnhart joked to The Associated Press this spring that he needed an algebra refresher just to call for a curveball.\n\n\u201cAdding dividing, multiplying,\u201d he said. \u201cAll kinds of stupid stuff.\u201d\n\nMajor League Baseball has instituted rules to crack down on digital spying, especially because MLB said \u201ca number of clubs\u201d called Commissioner Rob Manfred to express concerns about video equipment being used to steal signs last season.\n\nAlthough teams surely remain suspicious about the Astros and sign stealing, Houston\u2019s ability to recognize discrepancies in a pitcher\u2019s delivery has caused concern this month.\n\nAfter getting tagged by Houston in the decisive fifth game of the AL Division Series last week, Glasnow noticed on video he was broadcasting his breaking stuff.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty obvious as far as the tips go,\u201d he said.\n\nMore suspicions were raised in Game 2 of the AL Championship Series, when the Astros jumped on Paxton. Television cameras caught Alex Bregman saying \u201cglove\u201d to Houston\u2019s dugout after drawing a walk, a moment many interpreted as Bregman sharing a tell on Paxton\u2019s delivery.\n\nBregman has denied using such info this postseason and expressed annoyance Tuesday at social media sleuths searching for hints of it. But Yankees fans have good reason to be suspicious. Paxton was informed by former New York player Carlos Beltran after a start in April that Houston almost certainly knew what was coming.\n\nAnother former Yankees star is sure Severino was tipping in Game 3, when he threw 36 pitches in a rocky first inning of a 4-1 defeat.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Astros\u2019 hitters body language, this screams tipping,\u201d Alex Rodriguez tweeted.\n\nIt may be that Houston is noticing a wayward glove waggle in the moment, but cameras can also help - and legally, too.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s a lot of technology in the clubhouse,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, a 35-year-old breakout star for Washington this postseason.\n\nLongtime catcher Erik Kratz divulged a trade secret this spring. He told the AP that one of his former teams placed cameras behind home plate to detect when opponents were tipping. After games, the team would use video editing software to overlay each delivery from the pitcher.\n\nIf he was doing something differently on his breaking pitches - maybe moving an elbow in a funny fashion - the whole team would know to watch for it.\n\nKratz played for nine big league franchises, a list that includes the Astros and Yankees.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing illegal about that practice as Kratz described it, but every club has to decide how far it\u2019s willing to go.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gray in there,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said before NLCS Game 4 on Tuesday. \u201cSo my hope is that we\u2019re doing things within the game that is - again, everybody\u2019s got their own version of ethics, right? But there\u2019s a line there, and people can decide what line they want to stay on.\u201d\n\nNo matter what, it pays to be vigilant.\n\nThe Yankees are cautious even about what TV cameras might see in the dugout - after homering off Astros ace Justin Verlander in Game 2, slugger Aaron Judge walked up and down the bench whispering to teammates, using his batting helmet as a face shield. Whatever he knew, he didn\u2019t want Houston - or the public - finding out.\n\nJudge\u2019s covert message didn\u2019t hinder Verlander, who pitched two-run ball for 6 2/3 innings.\n\nHinch wouldn\u2019t find Judge to be out of line if it did. He believes hunting for pitch tells is basic recon work in today\u2019s game. Does a guy turn his glove grabbing at a change? Tend to throw fastballs in 2-0 counts?\n\nAll of it, fair game.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t overshadow the quality of play or the players or what\u2019s going on on the field,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cThe paranoia is real, though. And it\u2019s real across 30 teams.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Howard Fendrich contributed from Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Astros manager AJ Hinch has heard the chatter - that Rays starter Tyler Glasnow was offering a sneak peek on his offspeed deliveries, that Houston had a poker-worthy tell on Yankees hard throwers James Paxton and Luis Severino.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Seiner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/alcs_astros_yankees_baseball_38652_c0-209-5000-3125_s1200x700.jpg?a8bd3d48b2f8d33a07e13df86cfc59893ac9a4ad", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
