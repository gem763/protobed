In that shed, there's a big map of East Asia on the wall, with pictures and notes pinned to it.\n\nAnd it shows the South China Sea - with a series of lines marking what's known as China's nine-dash line.\n\nWhat is the nine-dash line?\n\nThe South China Sea is a strategically important region, rich in potential natural resources and fishing grounds, and lying between several influential countries.\n\nChina says it has always controlled a large chunk of this territory. The nine-dash line carves out by far the largest portion - leaving only a small coastal strip to each of the other claimants.\n\nIn 1947, China issued a map detailing its claims, and insists history backs up its claims.\n\nThe other claimants beg to differ.\n\nVietnam also has historic maps showing its claims, while the Philippines invokes its proximity to some of the islands, which have long been populated by Filipinos.\n\nWhile Taiwan's claim mirrors that of China (and China considers Taiwan to be part of China anyway), Malaysia and Brunei insist parts of the sea fall within their economic exclusion zones as defined by United Nations laws.\n\nThe Philippines have sought international arbitration - and a UN tribunal in 2016 backed Manila, saying China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights.\n\nBeijing, though, boycotted the proceedings and the ruling hasn't had any consequences.\n\nChina's rapidly growing influence in the region has the other claimants torn between taking a stance - or bowing to Beijing's economic might.\n\nWhy was it included in the film?\n\nIt's hard to say, as it doesn't actually play a role in the movie.\n\nBut Abominable the first co-production between US company DreamWorks and China's Pearl Studio production firm.\n\nWithin China, the sea is routinely shown with the nine-dash line. So for the Chinese side of the co-production, it's simply an accurate and normal map.\n\nMovie goers in Vietnam, though, were quick to accuse China of inserting the map to gradually make its claims less and less controversial on the global stage.\n\nIn fact, Beijing doesn't merely claim the territory: it runs naval patrols in the area and, for years, has been building military outposts on the disputed islands.\n\nIn some cases, small rocky reefs have turned into fully fledged military runways.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A BBC team flew over the disputed South China Sea islands in a US military plane\n\nOver the past few years, China has become more insistent on territorial questions.\n\nIt has, for instance, been increasingly strict in policing how foreign firms describe Hong Kong - which is part of China but has a special status - or Taiwan, which is self-ruled but which Beijing sees as a province of the mainland that has broken away.\n\nThis has led to officials and outraged Chinese social media users going after Western companies that use \"wrong\" maps.\n\nJust this week, Christian Dior apologised to China for using a map of China without Taiwan.\n\nWhat have Malaysia and other countries said?\n\n\"The film has been given approval for screening in Malaysia,\" the Malaysian film board chairman Mohamad Zamberi Abdul Aziz told news agency Reuters.\n\n\"Under the condition that the controversial map is removed from the film.\"\n\nVietnamese movie-goers were the first to notice the nine-dash line - and officials swiftly ordered the film to be pulled.\n\nNext was the Philippines, where public and politicians were equally upset. Foreign Minister Teddy Locsin on Twitter called for a boycott and speculated about cutting the map out of the movie.\n\nThe movie has been showing in the US since last month, and the map scene has largely gone unnoticed.\n\nYet the US is also frequently at loggerheads with Beijing over the South China Sea.\n\nThe US Navy routinely carries out what it calls \"freedom of navigation\" acts. Its ships sail through what the US calls international waters - only for China to accuse it of provocation and interference in regional matters.", "description": "How a brief scene in a multi-million dollar movie has sparked a regional row between countries.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B87/production/_109278486_08fb296b-c49d-4b31-88a7-942bef90cc51.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
