(AP) - Federal managers, Native American tribes and others have renegotiated the costs of a drinking water system that will serve communities in northern New Mexico.\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation says with the signed agreement, the start of construction on the Pojoaque Basin regional water system is one step closer. Work is expected to begin next year.\n\nThe system will consist of treatment facilities, storage tanks and transmission and distribution pipelines.\n\nIt will be able to supply more than 1 billion gallons (3.8 billion liters) of drinking water annually to the pueblos of Namb\u00e9, Tesuque, San Ildefonso and Pojoaque and other customers in Santa Fe County.\n\nThe agreement is a product of nearly a year of negotiations.
