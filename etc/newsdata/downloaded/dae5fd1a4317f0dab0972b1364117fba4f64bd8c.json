Harold \u201cPie\u201d Keller, not Pfc. Rene Gagnon, as had long been believed.\n\nThe correction comes three years after a previous inquiry found that another of the flag-raisers was Pfc. Harold Schultz, not Navy hospital corpsman John Bradley, NBC reported.\n\nThe image of the Marines raising the flag was captured in 1945 by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal, who won a Pulitzer Prize for the shot. It was later the inspiration for the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial statue in Arlington County, Va., which was dedicated in 1954.\n\nAccording to NBC, the latest correction to the list of flag-raising Marines resulted from a review by historians Stephen Foley, Dustin Spence and Brent Westmeyer, whose work was validated by investigators from the Marine Corps and the FBI.\n\nMARINE WALKS MORE THAN 800 MILES AROUND LAKE MICHIGAN IN 42 DAYS TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR VETERAN SUICIDE\n\n\"Without the initiative and contributions of both private historians devoted to preservation of our history and the FBI\u2019s Digital Evidence Laboratory, the Marine Corps would not have this opportunity to expand on the historical record of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi,\" the Marine Corps said in a statement, according to NBC.\n\nWith the recent correction, the list of six Marines in the iconic photo now includes Ira Hayes, Harold Schultz, Michael Strank, Harold \u201cPie\u201d Keller and Harlen Block, according to NBC.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut the Marine Corps added that, in a sense, it doesn\u2019t matter which Marines were in the photo, because the image represents the hard work, determination and sacrifice of all who served.\n\n\"Regardless of who was in the photograph, each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps\u2019 cherished history,\" the Marines' statement read. \"In the words of General David H.
