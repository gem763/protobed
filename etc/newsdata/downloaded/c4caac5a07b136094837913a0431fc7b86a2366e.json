During one of the emotional scenes, it hit me that it\u2019s real and it\u2019s actually happening and there are some genuine tears in there,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been amazing working with Ryan. It\u2019s been full on and we sometimes get on each others nerves but we just work so well together. We have a level of trust and understanding that I will really miss. We have great chemistry on screen and right from our first scene I felt and I guess the producers must have seen it too.\u2019\n\nAs for Aaron\u2019s storyline, the character will be left in a very dark place as a result of what happens, leaving mum Chas (Lucy Pargeter) and sister Liv (Isobel Steele) that he might be about to tip back into aggression, depression and self-harm.\n\nProducer Kate Brooks recently told Inside Soap: \u2018Robert leaving is going to hit him hard. He is the love of Aaron\u2019s life whom he adored, and has kept Aaron anchored and on the straight and narrow. So when the rug is pulled from underneath his feet, it really affects Aaron and it makes him behave in ways that he wouldn\u2019t normally.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think we\u2019re going to see the Aaron of old, before Robert came along and straightened him out. We have loads of great stuff for Danny and Isobel, as they try to navigate their world without Robert in it.\u2019\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights on ITV at 7pm.\n\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Victoria Barton in danger as newcomer Luke linked to rapist Lee?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Aaron Dingle has gone on the run with Emmerdale's Robert Sugden - but is actor Danny Miller leaving the soap?", "authors": ["Caroline Westbrook"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/robert-aaron-exit-emmerdale-474747-ebdb_1571237328.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
