I ride bikes every day, I ski, I still do a lot of sports, so for me it\u2019s a little more normal that I\u2019ll come in and do my action movies that I\u2019m ready and in shape,\u2019 the action stalwart told us ahead of Dark Fate\u2019s release.\n\nStill a boss (Picture: Paramount Pictures)\n\nSo, he, ah still does weights, skiis and bikes. Every day. At 72. Yep, we\u2019ve got a lot to live up to.\n\nArnold almost answers with a shrug, like age is but a number. To the former bodybuilding champion and Mr Olympia, we suppose it sort of is.\n\n\u2018When someone comes in who hasn\u2019t done it for a while, like Linda, it\u2019s more unusual,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018I always love it. In this movie the director was very demanding and he demanded a lot of action and a lot of work and we worked for hours and hours \u2013 yes even I got sore myself from all the reps.\u2019\n\nIn 1984\u2019s Terminator (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nHa! He\u2019s human, after all!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSorry, we\u2019ll let the man finish: \u2018But when you see the movie it pays off.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so great to watch it with all the visual effects and how well it was coordinated with the stunts.\u2019\n\nYes, the franchise has come a long way from when Arnold was directed to punch through very real glass windows in cars that weren\u2019t part of the set.\n\nLinda and Arnold waxed lyrical on the delight of joining forces for another walk down Terminator lane, where they\u2019ll always be back.\n\nArnold enthused: \u2018We were very happy working together and had a great time on set and after shooting, as always.\n\n\u2018I have to say I was blown away by Linda\u2019s performance\u2026not only from an acting point of view, the physicality of it. When you talk about her age, it\u2019s not the same when you\u2019re 60-years-old and you jump around [as] when you\u2019re 20 or 30; it\u2019s much more difficult.\n\n\u2018But she trained like crazy and put the hours and reps into it and did the weapons training and was as good as she was in Terminator 2 \u2013 if not better.\u2019\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is in cinemas Wednesday, 23 October.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
