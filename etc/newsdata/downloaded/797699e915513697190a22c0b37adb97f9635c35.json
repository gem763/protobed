Using weighted data, Bankrate determined the unemployment rates and median incomes for graduates across 162 majors that employed at least 15,000 people.\n\nThe median income for degree-holders in the study was $55,000, and the average unemployment rate was 2.8%. Bankrate supplied Business Insider directly with the number of graduates employed in each major on the list.\n\nThe major with the highest unemployment rate was petroleum engineering, with 7.5% \u2013 despite graduates with that major having a median income of $87,600.\n\nHere are the 20 college majors with the highest unemployment rates.\n\n20.
