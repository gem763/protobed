Carlos Ramon Carrillo de Villar, who oversaw formations of soldiers marching at a media event. \"We are fighting insecurity.\"\n\nThe convoys of army trucks with mounted machine guns rumbling through Culiacan's streets were meant to instill confidence. But a national poll on Monday showed two-thirds of respondents believe drug lords and mobsters are more powerful than the government after the gun battles last week that forced an army retreat.\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has insisted the decision to release Ovidio Guzman was the only way to save lives after cartel henchmen erected roadblocks, torched trucks and opened fire with heavy, military-style weapons.\n\nAfter a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump over the weekend, Mexican cabinet ministers met with U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau to ask for help stemming the flow of weapons bought legally in the United States and sold to cartels south of the border.\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says letting Guzman go was the right thing to do, in order to protect other lives.

(Alfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMurder rate falling\n\nHomicide data released on Sunday offered some hope for the strategy \u2014 showing murders fell in September for the third straight month.\n\nMexican authorities opened some 2,403 murder investigations during that month, a decline of seven per cent from the same month in 2018, and the lowest monthly total since April, according to the government figures. The months of July through September were the three most violent in 2018.\n\nEven so, the number of murders remains on track to surpass last year's record total of 29,000.\n\nOne poll released on Monday showed opinion was split over the operation in Culiacan. A survey by newspaper Reforma said 49 per cent disagreed with the release of the younger Guzman after his brief arrest by military police versus 45 per cent who backed it.\n\nA separate survey by polling firm GCE said between 54 and 34 per cent were against letting him go. Both surveyed 400 people.\n\nThe GCE poll showed 63.5 per cent of respondents believed drug traffickers were more powerful than the government.\n\nOver three-quarters in the GCE poll believed Guzman's release would encourage gangs to continue their operations, while nearly seven out of 10 in the Reforma survey said organized crime was strengthened by what had happened.", "description": "Mexico jumped into action on Monday in the wake of a cartel assault that freed Joaquin (El Chapo) Guzman's son in a northern city, sending in special forces to patrol the town and asking U.S. officials to stop gun-smuggling across the shared border.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5329666.1571703505!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/mexico-cartel-violence.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
