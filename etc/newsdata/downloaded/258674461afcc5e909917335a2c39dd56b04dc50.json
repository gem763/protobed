(Don Wright)\n\nFor one night, at least, all was well again with the Pittsburgh Steelers. All it took was a visit from a team with problems even bigger than theirs.\n\nThe Steelers got into the win column for the season by riding a sharp performance by their fill-in starter at quarterback, Mason Rudolph, to a 27-3 triumph Monday over the Cincinnati Bengals at Heinz Field.\n\nThe \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup of 0-3 teams became a showcase for Rudolph, who completed 24 of 28 passes for 229 yards and two touchdowns in his second NFL start. The Steelers have eased him into the lineup with a cautious approach as he replaces Ben Roethlisberger, who\u2019s sidelined after undergoing season-ending elbow surgery. They stuck mostly to a short passing game that yielded a second-quarter touchdown throw to tailback James Conner. But Rudolph also unleashed a down-the-field throw with a 43-yard touchdown to a wide-open Diontae Johnson in the third quarter.\n\nJaylen Samuels added a third-quarter touchdown run when he lined up at quarterback and took a shotgun snap out of a Wildcat formation. The Steelers, at 1-3, suddenly find themselves only a game behind the first-place Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North.\n\nThis was their first victory since trading wide receiver Antonio Brown and allowing tailback Le\u2019Veon Bell to leave via free agency in the offseason in what was supposed to be an addition-by-subtraction housecleaning. It became more like subtraction by subtraction when Roethlisberger got hurt. But Rudolph halted the downward spiral, at least temporarily, Monday.\n\nThe Bengals, now 0-4, remained winless under their first-year head coach, Zac Taylor. Quarterback Andy Dalton was sacked eight times, lost a fumble and threw an interception while playing behind an overmatched offensive line.

(Steelers 27, Bengals 3 with 5:51 left in the 4th quarter)\n\nDalton throws interception: The Bengals can\u2019t even score cosmetic points. They reached the Pittsburgh 8-yard line before being pushed back by a false start. On fourth and goal from the 13-yard line, Andy Dalton threw an end zone interception to the Steelers\u2019 Mark Barron.

Diontae Johnson got wide open and Rudolph made an on-target throw for a 43-yard touchdown. The Steelers are on a roll now, and Rudolph has completed 20 of 23 passes for 207 yards and two touchdowns. (Steelers 24, Bengals 3 with 9:24 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nSteelers get quick TD: The Steelers added to their lead with a nice drive to begin the third quarter. Jaylen Samuels scored on a two-yard run after lining up at quarterback and taking a shotgun snap. After a sluggish start on offense in the first quarter, the Steelers moved the ball well in the second quarter and that has continued into the early stages of the second half. (Steelers 17, Bengals 3 with 10:36 left in the 3rd quarter)\n\nHalftime in Pittsburgh: Mason Rudolph, Pittsburgh\u2019s fill-in starter at quarterback with Ben Roethlisberger reduced to spectator status after undergoing season-ending elbow surgery, completed 17 of 18 first-half passes and the Steelers lead the Bengals, 10-3. The Steelers are sticking to a short-passing game with Rudolph and he\u2019s been sharp. He threw a second-quarter touchdown pass to tailback James Conner and the Steelers added a field goal just before halftime. They could have been further ahead if not for their woes with their short-yardage offense. Conner was stopped on a fourth-and-one try in the first quarter and Jaylen Samuels was thrown for a loss on a third-and-three run before the field goal. The Bengals managed only a first-quarter field goal, and quarterback Andy Dalton lost a fumble on a sack to end a promising second-quarter drive. The game has had the requisite officiating issues. The Bengals appeared to contend to the officials that the Steelers\u2019 touchdown should have been nullified by a penalty for a lineman being illegally down the field. But it went uncalled and that is not reviewable by replay. Coach Mike Tomlin also lost an instant replay challenge attempting to overturn an offensive pass interference penalty called against the Steelers.

(Justin Berl/Getty Images)\n\n2nd Quarter\n\nSteelers increase lead: Pittsburgh upped its lead with a 29-yard field goal by kicker Chris Boswell. The Steelers moved the ball well but their short-yardage offense remained a problem. Jaylen Samuels was thrown for a four-yard loss on a third-and-three rushing attempt right before Boswell\u2019s kick. (Steelers 10, Bengals 3 with 58 seconds left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nDalton loses fumble: The Bengals had a nice drive going, reaching the Pittsburgh 18-yard line. But on a first-down play, Dalton lost a fumble on a sack by the Steelers\u2019 Bud Dupree. Maybe the Bengals should have gone back to that \u201cFilthy Brady\u201d audible they used earlier on the drive. (Steelers 7, Bengals 3 with 5:49 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\n\u2018Filthy Brady\u2019 for Bengals?: Quarterback Andy Dalton could be heard on the ESPN broadcast using a \u201cFilthy Brady!\u201d audible call with the Bengals at the line of scrimmage.\n\nSteelers take lead: The Steelers, seeking their first victory of the season, have the lead over the also-winless Bengals in the second quarter at Heinz Field. Fill-in quarterback Mason Rudolph threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to tailback James Conner. The Steelers capitalized on a short field, taking over at the Cincinnati 46-yard line after pinning the Bengals deep in their own territory and forcing a punt. On a third-and-two play, Rudolph sprinted out to his right and threw a dart of a short throw to Conner, who bulled his way into the end zone. The Steelers are sticking to a short-passing game with Rudolph and he\u2019s off to an 11-for-12 start.

Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin, a member of that committee, challenged an offensive pass interference penalty called on Pittsburgh wide receiver Johnny Holton. He\u2019d been penalized for a light push-off of a defender. But there certainly was contact and, after the replay review, referee Bill Vinovich announced that the call on the field stood. The Steelers lost a timeout and Tomlin has only one replay challenge remaining in the game.\n\n\n\nCoach Mike Tomlin on Monday. (Joe Sargent/Getty Images)\n\nSteelers stuffed on fourth down: Not much has gone right for the Steelers in the early stages of this season, and the misery is continuing early in this game. Coach Mike Tomlin left his offense on the field for a fourth-and-one try from the Cincinnati 42-yard line. It didn\u2019t work, as tailback James Conner was stopped for no gain. (Bengals 3, Steelers 0 with 4:02 left in 1st quarter)\n\nBengals get FG off turnover: The Bengals have the early lead in Pittsburgh in a matchup of 0-3 teams. Cincinnati got a field goal off a Steelers\u2019 turnover, a fumble lost by Diontae Johnson following a catch on Pittsburgh\u2019s second offensive play. That set up the Bengals at the Pittsburgh 15-yard line but they had to settle for a 28-yard field goal by kicker Randy Bullock. On the play before Bullock\u2019s kick, quarterback Andy Dalton\u2019s third-and-five pass sailed a bit high and the ball bounced off the fingertips of tight end Tyler Eifert in the end zone for an incompletion. The Bengals had punted on the game\u2019s opening possession.
