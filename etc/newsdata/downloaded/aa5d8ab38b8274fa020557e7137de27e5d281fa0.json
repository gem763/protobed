Gender violence, she added, has a \u201cripple effect\u201d on all areas of life, including equal pay, paid family leave, childcare and more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about individual behavior,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe are talking about systemic problems that have become embedded in our practices, policies, our contracts, every aspect of our work lives.\u201d\n\nHill referenced the hashtag #MeTooVoter, recently created by Me Too founder Tarana Burke to galvanize conversations about sexual violence in the U.S.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, women took to the streets, and one of the reasons is because of the issues raised by the Me Too movement,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a powerful force.\u201d\n\nHill later addressed the controversial confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. When an audience member asked how the Kavanaugh hearings affected her, Hill responded that they hit her with \u201cprofound disappointment and sadness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe perception that so many people had ... was that we haven\u2019t made any advances in 28 years,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know that is not the case, and I think we all know that, but then when we had the opportunity to display it, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "description": "The law professor said the issue of sexual violence \"needs to be addressed\" because it is a systemic problem.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf39472100008821ad393b.jpeg?cache=kfilixu5xq&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
