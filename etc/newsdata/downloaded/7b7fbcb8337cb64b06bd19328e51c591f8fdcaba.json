Many Kashmiris hostile to India's rule often gather to throw stones at security forces after militants are killed.\n\nIn a separate incident in south Kashmir's Pulwama district, suspected militants shot dead a migrant worker from Chhattisgarh state, in central India, in an execution-style killing, police said.\n\n\"Area has been cordoned and searches are going on,\" Kashmir police said in a tweet.\n\nSagar, who worked as a labourer at brick kiln, was walking along a railway track in the Kakapora area when he was stopped by two people. \"He was shot in the head,\" a police official said, declining to be named.", "description": "UPDATE 2-Deadly day in Kashmir as three militants killed, migrant worker shot dead", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/news_headline_open_108x81._800x533_L_1419519630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
