Katie Hill apologizes for affair with female campaign aide whose hair she was brushing in naked photograph", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Katie Hill apologized to constituents for engaging in an affair with a campaign worker and promised to work with the House Ethics Committee, which is conducting an investigation into allegations she was also romantically involved with her legislative director, Graham Kelly.\n\nAn photo of Hill, first published by RedState on Friday, shows a naked Hill, 32, sitting on a chair and combing the hair of a fully clothed woman - identified as an aide on her 2018 election campiagn - kneeling in front of her.\n\nThe California Democrat, who sits on one of the panels conducting an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, called the accusation that she ws involved with Kelly a \u201cfalse allegation\u201d on Wednesday. She struck a contrite tone in a letter to constituents when talking about her affair with a young female campaign worker.\n\n\u201cDuring the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign,\u201d Hill wrote to constituents, shortly after the Ethics Committee announced an investigation into her behavior with Kelly.\n\n\u201cI know even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate. But I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment. For that I apologize.\u201d\n\nHill called the naked photo of her a \u201ccoordinated effort to try to destroy me and the people close to me.\u201d She called the release of the photo \u201cdespicable.\u201d\n\nThe photo was released amid her contested divorce from her husband, who was also mutually involved with the campaign staffer and who is seeking alimony. The husband appears to have filed for divorce when he learned of her alleged affair with Kelly, according to text messages leaked to RedState.\n\nHill sits on the House Oversight panel, which is among three committees conducting a closed-door impeachment inquiry regarding Trump. Hill staff did not respond to requests for comment from the Washington Examiner.", "description": "Rep.
