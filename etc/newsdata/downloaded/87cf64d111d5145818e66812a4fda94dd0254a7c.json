That\u2019s why he used to catch everyone.\"\n\nCobra says when bosses found out about his boozing they wanted to ask him, but the production crew stood up for him and he kept his job until 2000.\n\nThe star has told before about how he and the other Gladiators used to party hard behind the scenes.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nHe said: \"We never had to drive anywhere, we had hospitality twice a day so there would be wine and booze and stuff flowing.\n\n\"Ironically, I never used to drink a drop before I joined Gladiators.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Cobra was seriously ill and battling pneumonia in hospital.\n\nAt the time, he blamed his illness on his punishing workouts for the ITV show.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe told The Sun : \"I\u2019m only half a Gladiator now. It\u2019s been touch and go.\n\n\"I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m kicking the bucket at the minute, but it will only take another cold or cough and I\u2019m in trouble.\"\n\nHe added: \"I\u2019m isolated in my own ward. It goes to show \u2013 you never know what\u2019s around the corner.\"\n\nHe later needed hip surgery.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
