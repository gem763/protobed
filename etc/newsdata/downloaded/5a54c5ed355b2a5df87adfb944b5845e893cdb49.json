Usually, it\u2019s with these sort of woke corporate fascists who are trying to use their clout as corporations to try to silence people, but that\u2019s expanded as of this weekend, where a Daily Beast editor suggested that the Los Angeles Police Department not put recruitment ads on Breitbart News.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, Daily Beast editor in chief Noah Shachtman tweeted a de facto call for an advertiser boycott of Breitbart News:\n\nUhhhh why is the LAPD running recruitment ads on Breitbart?! pic.twitter.com/9gr1hnmy4o \u2014 Noah Shachtman (@NoahShachtman) September 28, 2019\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department described Breitbart News as opposed to its \u201ccore values\u201d in a response to Shachtman\u2019s above-posted tweet:\n\nThe LAPD celebrates diversity and embraces it within our ranks, and within the city we serve. We are aware that a recruitment advertisement has been circulated on a website that creates a negative juxtaposition to our core values. \u2014 LAPD HQ (@LAPDHQ) September 28, 2019\n\n\u201cNow, the ads show up for LAPD recruitment via Google\u2019s algorithmic advertising placement on placement,\u201d explained Marlow. \u201cThis has now been deemed an outrage by the Los Angeles Police Department who says Breitbart \u2014 which is arguably the largest pro-law enforcement website operating in the United States, and happens to be based in Los Angeles \u2014 [is] now opposed to their \u2018core values\u2019; their expression, not ours.\u201d\n\nMarlow stated, \u201cI think this is unbelievably frightening, because Breitbart is, of course, an incredibly diverse [and] large outlet that has people from every single background out there. This is a war on conservatism, and now conservatives are apparently banned from LAPD \u201c\n\nLISTEN:\n\nLeft-wing and partisan Democrat censorship and boycott campaigns against dissident news media outlets are rooted in fear, Marlow continued.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s utter fear, because the reason we have a conservative movement in America is because people don\u2019t listen to the alphabet network,\u201d he remarked. \u201cThey don\u2019t get their news from the New York Times or CNN. They can get their news from talk radio, and now they can get their news from a network of online outlets and some streaming outlets. Breitbart may be the most influential of all of those, aside from, of course, talk radio as a whole, [which] is of course, number one and has been for decades. But this is a new thing that will stop the left in their tracks \u2014 and has time and time again. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d\n\nLevin asked Marlow of communications between Breitbart News and the LAPD following the aforementioned developments.\n\nMarlow recalled, \u201cWe were able to speak only off-record, and of course we asked them \u2014 and I can\u2019t divulge too much, because I want to be an honorable journalist \u2014 but let\u2019s put it this way, they did not have great answers when we asked them, \u2018What is it in our core values that do not match up with the LAPD?\u2019 We\u2019re overwhelmingly pro-law enforcement. We have a hugely diverse staff, just top to bottom\u2026 It\u2019s laughable to suggest we\u2019re anything other than a diverse coalition of millions of Americans, and they won\u2019t give us an example. They wouldn\u2019t give us a simple example of what we do that\u2019s against their core values.\u201d\n\nLevin invited Marlow\u2019s comments on how observers should react to the LAPD\u2019s top brass\u2019s alignment with a left-wing and partisan Democrat censorship and boycott operation.\n\n\u201cI would love to see people contact the LAPD,\u201d replied Marlow. \u201cI would love to see [this], particularly [from] the rank and file, even though they\u2019re putting themselves at significant risk if they do. \u2026 Try to reach out if you can to suggest that a government law enforcement entity discriminating against conservatives that hold normative viewpoints in America is not just inappropriate, it\u2019s wildly frightening to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nMarlow added, \u201cWe know that the rank and file law enforcement of the LAPD are pro-Breitbart, and they\u2019re pro-conservative, and they like the things that we stand for. It\u2019s the people at the very upper echelons.\u201d\n\nLevin noted, \u201cThe left does not believe in a diversity of viewpoints. It believes in uniformity, and it seeks to enforce it.\u201d\n\nMarlow responded, \u201cI would love for people to tweet at [the LAPD], to call the phone number on the LAPD website, have friends and friends reach out, and most importantly, I think it\u2019s time for us to stand up and be counted, now. It\u2019s not enough to be passive and just wait for November every other year and vote. I think people need to start being more vocal, and I know there\u2019s a risk, but it feels like the country is at risk. Does it not feel to you that the stakes keep getting higher and higher?\u201d\n\nLevin concurred, \u201cAbsolutely. This is much different then when I started almost 40 years ago in the conservative movement. It\u2019s a very serious threat, and it\u2019s a threat across the board. I can\u2019t think of any norm \u2014 any part of the civil society \u2014 that\u2019s not under attack.\u201d\n\nMarlow stated, \u201cThey can\u2019t cite one example of racism if you ever ask them to. This is about stamping out conservative voices\u2026 I see this not just as an attack on Breitbart and our audience, but it\u2019ll be you next. It\u2019ll be Fox. It\u2019ll be whatever it is, your favorite online website that provides news that\u2019s not CNN-approved. They\u2019re coming for you next. We\u2019re just the tip of the spear.\u201d\n\nLevin concluded by noting the ubiquity of left-wing and partisan Democrat leadership across America\u2019s largest cities.\n\n\u201cDo you believe this?\u201d asked Levin. \u201cSenior level of the LAPD. I\u2019m a free speech guy. That\u2019s what I am. [It\u2019s okay] if you have a different viewpoint. Their viewpoints on law enforcement are much different from the rank and file police officer, but the top levels in these major cities of the police forces \u2014 the politically appointed cops and so forth at the top levels in these big blue cities \u2013reporting to these Marxist mayors, they\u2019re sell-outs. Again, we\u2019re not talking about the cop on the beat. We\u2019re talking about at the very top. They\u2019re sell-outs, like they were in Baltimore. In New York with Mayor de Commio, and other cities, too. It\u2019s very sad.\u201d\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "description": "Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore is a \"sell-out\" reporting to a \"Marxist\" mayor, said Mark Levin in a talk with Breitbart's Alex Marlow.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/16503249209_4c9db7dab6_k-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
