The initial poll in 1998 found that hard work, patriotism, religion and having children were Americans\u2019 top priorities.\n\nThe new poll found that just one generation later, the value system for many Americans looks very different. In 2019, hard work still tops the list of most important values, but the value we place today on patriotism, religion, and having children is drastically reduced.\n\nHere\u2019s how quickly things have changed:\n\n- In 1998, 70 percent of Americans said that patriotism was very important to them. In 2019, only 61 percent said the same thing.\n\nMILLENNIALS CARE LESS ABOUT PATRIOTISM, RELIGION AND FAMILY THAN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS, STUDY SAYS\n\n- In 1998, 62 percent said religion was very important to them. In 2019, only 50 percent.\n\n- In 1998, 59 percent said having children was very important to them. In 2019, only 43 percent.\n\nThe poll revealed that this change was driven primarily by younger Americans. For example, only about 42 percent of Americans between 18-38 consider patriotism very important, fewer than one-third consider religion very important and, perhaps most concerning, is the finding that only 30 percent of today\u2019s young people consider having children very important.\n\nAt first look, patriotism, religion, and having children have little in common, but there is one quality of the soul we must have to value any of them; it is hope.\n\nThink about it: without hope, why would you go to church? Without hope, why would you have children? Without hope, why would you be devoted to your country?\n\nHope is the persistent conviction that things are going to get better, that no matter how tough things are now, there is a reason to be grateful and to move forward with confidence because we count on a brighter future.\n\nBut without hope, we live only for the moment, and we don\u2019t waste energy or time on a future that might be worse than what we can get out of life now. Think about it: without hope, why would you go to church? Without hope, why would you have children? Without hope, why would you be devoted to your country?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nHope is at the heart of religious faith. Believers hope because we trust that God will be faithful to his many promises. We are hopeful that he will \u201cmake a way in the wilderness and rivers in the dessert\u201d (Isaiah 43:19), that the injustices and suffering of this life are temporal, while in the afterlife, God \u201cwill make all things new\u201d and \u201cwipe every tear from your eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain\u201d (Rev. 21: 4, 5). That\u2019s a lot of hope!\n\nHope is at the heart of wanting to have children. The intentionality of bringing new life into the world, as a product of committed love, says with no uncertainty, that we believe our human existence is inherently good and we want to give this amazing gift of life to someone else. That\u2019s a lot of hope!\n\nHope is at the heart of healthy patriotism. Devotion and vigorous support for one\u2019s country only makes sense if we believe our country has something good to offer the world and to us.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLoyalty to our country is a virtue when we know the object of our affection (our country) is already good or at least redeemable. If we have no hope in the always redeemable character of our country there is no logical reason to be patriotic. But when we value our country\u2019s unique history and role in the world, we will be ready to sacrifice for it, even giving our lives in her defense. That\u2019s a lot of hope!\n\nWhy has hope been lost by so many Americans, especially young Americans? That\u2019s a good topic for another op-ed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN MORRIS", "description": "At first look, patriotism, religion, and having children have little in common, but there is one quality of the soul we must have to value any of them.
