Brigid Kosgei - Kenya - Time: 2.14.04 - Date: 13/10/2019 - Venue: Chicago Marathon 2. Paula Radcliffe - England - Time: 2.15.25 - Date: 13/04/2003 - Venue: London Marathon 3. Mary Jepkosgei Keitany - Kenya - Time: 2.17.01 - Date: 23/04/2017 - Venue: London Marathon 4. Ruth Chepngetich - Kenya - Time: 2.17.08 - Date: 25/01/2019 - Venue: Dubai Marathon 5. Worknesh Degefa - Ethiopia - Time: 2.17.41 - Date: 25/01/2019 - Venue: Dubai Marathon\n\nThe 45-year-old was caught in the eye of a storm last week after appearing equivocal about US Anti-Doping Agency's investigation into Alberto Salazar, the coach who was convicted of doping offences earlier this month.\n\nSalazar, who was working with Mo Farah when he won his four gold medals, was handed a four-year suspension following the investigation's findings.\n\nRadcliffe admitted the decision to ban Salazar was the 'right' one but questioned whether the investigation was money and time well spent - something she was widely condemned for.\n\nThe three-time London and New York marathon runner, who is an MBE and currently resides in Monaco, has been a vocal campaigner against doping in the past, but suggested money spent on the investigation into the Nike Oregon Project and its doctor, Jeffrey Brown, who has also been banned from the sport, would have been better directed on research.\n\nCoach Alberto Salazar (above) was banned for four years for doping offences last week\n\nRadcliffe questioned whether the investigation was money and time well spent\n\nHead of USADA, Travis Tygart, hit back at Radcliffe for her comments on the Salazar probe\n\nRadcliffe's comments were accused of being heavy with the weight of vested interests and corporate loyalties, while she also speculated whether the timing of the investigation was related to USADA's failure to get sprint star Christian Coleman banned, a claim she later retracted.\n\nHead of USADA, Travis Tygart, hit back at Radcliffe for her comments last week, saying: 'I guess it's disappointing but that time and effort was needed to get to the truth. It was the efforts by this doctor and this coach to avoid the truth which [meant it] took as long as it took, which none of us our happy about.\n\n'And the expense that went into it is was because of the money that was spent on the other side attempting to hide the truth. The rich and the powerful will cheat the world if you can't get to the truth because of the money and the power that those who are trying to hide the truth have. We took on the obligation to protect clean athletes and took on the job that we're supposed to do.\n\n'If people don't like that, that's fine. We'll turn spot into a free-for-all where you can have medication programmes and jeopardise the health and safety of athletes. If that's what we want sport to be, we'll close shop and get other jobs. But I don't think that's what sport should be and I don't think that's what athletes in clean sport and fair play want. I think sport will be ruined if it goes down that track.'", "description": "Kosgei clocked a winning time of 2.14.04 to finish comfortably\u00a0inside of Radcliffe's mark of 2:15:25 set at the London 2003 marathon,\u00a0to retain her Chicago title on Sunday.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658384-0-image-a-62_1570979304557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
