In return, his co-host Jesse Watters, a Trump booster, accused him of using the judge\u2019s \u201ctalking points.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above to see the sparring in action.", "description": "The rift between Fox\u2019s news and commentary wings has never been more apparent.", "authors": ["Tasia Jensen", "Video Journalist"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_720,w_1280,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569529510/FoxNewsCivilWar_arvush", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
