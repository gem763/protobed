He was speaking at a panel discussion during the India Economic Summit.\n\nHuawei's technology has come under scrutiny and countries like the U.S., Japan, and Australia have banned the company from participating in their 5G developments. Washington says Huawei's 5G technology could enable spying by China. Huawei has repeatedly denied that its products represent any risks.\n\n5G is the next-generation of high-speed mobile internet that aims to provide faster data speeds and more bandwidth to carry growing levels of web traffic.\n\nIn May, the U.S. added Huawei and its affiliates to a blacklist, halting its ability to do business with American companies. Washington later softened its stance and granted temporary reprieve to the Chinese tech company.", "description": "U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says he hopes India \"does not inadvertently subject itself to untoward security risk\" by using 5G equipment from Huawei.", "authors": ["Saheli Roy Choudhury"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105990391-1561608105149huaweilogo.jpg?v=1568778251", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
