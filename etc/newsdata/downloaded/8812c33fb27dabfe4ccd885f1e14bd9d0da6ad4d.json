Most are comedic in tone, ranging from clips of pets in costumes, to teens' impersonations of their parents dancing.\n\nThe Beijing-based company ByteDance first released TikTok in 2017 and has since grown it into one of the world's top apps. The company merged TikTok with another popular clip-sharing service, musical.ly, last year.\n\nA recent report by the mobile app data firm Sensor Tower found TikTok to be among the most-downloaded apps worldwide between July and September 2019, second only to messaging software WhatsApp.\n\nCanadian expansion\n\nByteDance shows signs it's interested in expanding further, particularly in Canada. Ads posted this month on the online professional networking site LinkedIn suggest the firm is seeking to hire staff in Toronto, including a brand partnerships manager and a customer solutions manager .\n\n\"We are at the earliest building stages of the global business solutions team in Canada,\" an online ad for TikTok said. \"Today, the market is showing much anticipation and excitement toward this quickly expanding platform.\"\n\nTikTok did not immediately respond to CBC's request for comment on the firm's Canadian expansion.\n\nUsers in Canada are embracing TikTok. As of Friday, it was ranked second among the top-downloaded entertainment programs in Apple's Canadian App Store, above both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nA TikTok video of NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh went viral during the recent federal election campaign, as he lip-synced the words \"nope\" and \"yup\" from rapper E-40's song Choices, while seeking to highlight his party's platform.\n\nAllegations of censorship\n\nBut observers say political videos critical of Beijing have been received less kindly.\n\nLast month, The Guardian reported TikTok takes steps to censor content related to the Tiananmen Square massacre, Tibetan independence or the banned movement Falun Gong \u2014 all sensitive topics in China. The report came after the Washington Post highlighted how few TikTok videos out of Hong Kong showed any sign of unrest, even as pro-democracy protests roiled the city.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO of rival Facebook, called out the company \u2014 and China \u2014 in a speech last week.\n\n\"While our services, like WhatsApp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even here in the U.S.,\" he said. \"Is that the internet we want?\"\n\nDuring a speech this week at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg accused TikTok of censorship. (Nick Wass/The Associated Press)\n\nAnd earlier this month, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio accused Beijing of exporting its suppression of free speech with Chinese-developed software, while asking the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to look into the company.\n\n\"There continues to be ample and growing evidence that TikTok's platform for Western markets \u2026 is censoring content that is not in line with the Chinese government and Communist Party directives,\" Rubio wrote.\n\nIn its statement , TikTok shot back at claims of censorship, saying its staff \"have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked.\"\n\nTikTok said its American user data is stored in the U.S., with \"backup redundancy\" in Singapore, and is not subject to Chinese law.\n\nU.S. investigation demanded\n\nThe public remarks this week read like a direct response to a letter, released just hours earlier, sent by two other U.S. lawmakers demanding a national security investigation into TikTok.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Senator Chuck Schumer and his Republican counterpart Tom Cotton sent the memo to the acting director of national intelligence, alleging TikTok's policies allow the app to collect wide-ranging data from users and that the firm is still required to follow Chinese law.\n\nExperts say Chinese law forces companies to share intelligence with Beijing, even when the data is collected abroad.\n\nChinese company ByteDance's app TikTok, known locally as Douyin, is seen on display at the International Artificial Products Expo in Hangzhou, China on Oct. 18, 2019. (Reuters)\n\nThe concern has been underlined extensively in relation to Huawei, leading the Chinese tech giant to be banned from 5G mobile network development in Australia and Japan.\n\nTikTok, the U.S. senators wrote, is \"a potential counter-intelligence threat we cannot ignore.\"\n\nChina is known to have invested heavily in facial recognition technology. And TikTok could potentially act as a source of millions of images of faces, often those of teenagers.\n\nCavoukian is urging users to delete TikTok \u2014 or avoid downloading it in the first place.\n\n\"If [your] information is ending up in China, it's the last thing you want, especially at a young age.\"", "description": "Under fire from U.S. lawmakers, TikTok was forced this week to issue a rare public statement about whether it gathers intelligence for \u2014 and censors content on behalf of \u2014 Beijing. The popular Chinese-owned video-sharing app denies both accusations. It comes as TikTok plans a Canadian expansion.", "authors": ["Senior Technology Reporter", "While In Cbc'S London", "U.K. Bureau", "Thomas Reported On Everything The Royal Family", "European Politics To Terrorism.
