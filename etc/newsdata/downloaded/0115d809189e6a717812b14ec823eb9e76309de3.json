(Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nFor many, the words \u201cpasta e fagioli\u201d conjure the image of a particular dish with a tomato-laden broth, but pasta and beans don\u2019t stop at that. The duo is the foundation of a multitude of wonderful one-pot variations, all simple, hearty and nutritious. This one, studded with artichoke hearts in a lovely, lemony liquid also brings an easy elegance to the table.\n\nThe bean used here is the mighty chickpea, and this dish so chock-full of them that it warrants being called a chickpea stew. At the start, some are mashed with a little broth and lemon juice and are added to thicken the broth in the end. The rest are simmered in broth with carrots, onions, garlic and rosemary. Then pasta is added to the pot where it is cooked al dente before the artichokes and ribbons of spinach are stirred in.\n\nQuick, flavorful and fulfilling, it\u2019s exactly the kind of meal you need to help ease the adjustment to the back-to-school routine.", "description": "NOURISH | With lemon, artichokes and other vegetables, this healthful bowl won\u2019t weigh you down.", "authors": ["Ellie Krieger", "September At Pm", "Krieger Is A Registered Dietitian", "Nutritionist", "Author Who Hosts Public Television S", "Ellie S Real Good Food.", "She Blogs", "Offers A Weekly Newsletter At"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9SW8Jji7CWtoHRI_-HU3TGJHNfk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NK32VUWE2MI6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
