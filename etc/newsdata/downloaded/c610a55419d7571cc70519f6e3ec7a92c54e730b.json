Call it blasphemy, but Julian Fellowes doesn\u2019t see it quite that way: As far as the creator/writer of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d is concerned, having Windsors to dinner is one royal pain.\n\nWhich is precisely what provides the plot\u2014and the bite\u2014to \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d the much-anticipated movie version of the highly popular, class-centric soap opera and darling of PBS fundraising. The series, which ran for six seasons, 52 episodes and spanned the years 1912-26, more or less preserved the English social system in amber; the hierarchy was questioned, but seldom impugned. So when a letter arrives announcing that George V and Queen Mary will be visiting Downton as part of their \u201cYorkshire tour\u201d\u2014they just invite themselves wherever they wish to go, apparently\u2014the response is predictable: a mix of pride and hysterical stage fright. Can the staff pull it off? What will they serve? Can someone please polish the silver properly! And summon Mr. Carson ( Jim Carter ) out of retirement!\n\nAnd then they find they have nothing to do. The royals are bringing their own valets, their own footmen, their own food, their own chef. Pride and panic turn into indignation. And intrigue.\n\nMr. Fellowes, being something of a genius at briskly established plotlines and characterizations, clearly knew that a regal visit would be an ideal way to show off the best and worst of each Downton habitu\u00e9, from Robert and Cora Crawley, the earl and countess of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern ), to Lady Mary in her new Louise Brooks bob (the hair will no doubt be a sensation), to the folks below stairs, each of whom has his or her moment of valor or shame. While there\u2019s an enhanced lushness to \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d\u2014the interiors seem richer, the aerial shots of that glorious house are more exalted\u2014it hasn\u2019t changed in its overall visual approach: The closest thing to a close-up are the shots introducing various characters, which seem intended to reassure fans that no one is missing, except those characters who were killed off in such wholesale fashion back when the series was a going concern. There are no flashbacks to Lady Sybil or Matthew Crawley. It is, and remains, 1927.\n\nLaura Carmichael as Lady Hexham, Elizabeth McGovern as Lady Grantham and Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Talbot Photo: FOCUS FEATURES\n\nBeing so, the king is George V ( Simon Jones, looking very much like the real George, and Czar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm) and his queen is Mary ( Geraldine James ), both of whom are portrayed not necessarily as the salt of the earth but as people who are conscious of the disruption they cause when they mingle with their subjects. Mr. Fellowes\u2019s script is not a critique of the monarchs themselves, but of the undignified manner in which they cause those subjects to act. The kitchen crew\u2014the guileless Daisy ( Sophie McShera ), the efficient Mrs. Patmore ( Lesley Nicol )\u2014are rattled by the impending visit, but are ready for the task. Mr. Molesley ( Kevin Doyle ), on the other hand, can\u2019t stop twitching with anticipation, and Mr. Bakewell the grocer ( Mark Addy ), upon considering the idea that his goods will be feeding his king, is quite frank: \u201cIt\u2019s the peak of my career. My life, really.\u201d It\u2019s embarrassing. And intended to be.\n\nWith a two-hour running time, \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d can indulge itself in some of the more delicious aspects of its six-season run. For instance, the absolutely hilarious sniping between Isobel Grey, n\u00e9e Crawley, the Baroness Merton (the wonderful Penelope Wilton ) and the imperious Dowager Countess Violet Crawley (\u201cI don\u2019t argue. I explain\u201d), who is imbued with the usual mix of vinegar and marmalade by the great Maggie Smith. Accused of being Machiavellian, Violet responds that \u201cMachiavelli is frequently underrated\u201d and proceeds to scheme throughout the film to position her son, Robert, as heir to a wealthy cousin, Maud Bagshaw ( Imelda Staunton ), who seems inclined to leave her family mansion to her maid, Lucy (Tuppence Middleton).\n\nMaggie Smith stars as the Dowager Countess of Grantham and Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary Talbot Photo: FOCUS FEATURES\n\nLucy has a secret. What\u2019s no secret is the flame of romance that sparks between her and Tom Branson ( Allen Leech ) or that Mr. Fellowes is very busy pairing all his previously uncoupled characters with partners\u2014notably the gay butler Barrow ( Robert James-Collier ), who is rescued from a raid on a gay bar having been unceremoniously usurped by Mr. Carson during preparations for the royal dinner. There\u2019s a valedictory tidiness to all the budding romance, yet the feeling that they\u2019ll all be back at Downton Abbey. \u201cI believe we are stuck with it, aren\u2019t we,\u201d says Violet, to which her granddaughter Mary says, \u201cYes, I believe we are.\u201d I didn\u2019t feel stuck at all.\n\n\u2014Mr. Anderson is a Journal TV critic.
