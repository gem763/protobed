REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nReduced shipments to off price stores and the impact of a delayed acquisition of a South American distributor drove net revenue down about 3% in the region, the first fall since the 165-year-old company went public in March.\n\n\u201cU.S. wholesale was challenged... particularly the legacy department stores and chain stores, where (the) much publicized traffic declines have negatively impacted our business,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Chip Bergh said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThe deteriorating retail landscape has forced longstanding brick-and-mortar chains, including J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), to explore options, as they struggle to boost their e-commerce business to compete with the likes of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).\n\nBergh said Levi\u2019s has been focusing on selling directly to customers through its stores and online than through off price retailers.\n\nLevi\u2019s teamed up with model Chanel Iman and New York Giants player Sterling Shepard during the quarter to create an exclusive drop, launching limited merchandise, for e-commerce retailer Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) fashion line.\n\n\u201cWe only sell to that (off price) channel... the distressed inventory that we\u2019re trying to clear. We don\u2019t think its good for the brand,\u201d Bergh said..\n\nJane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said in the long run, Levi\u2019s direct-to-consumer model would yield results, but issues in the wholesale business remain a concern.\n\nRevenue from the direct-to-consumer business in the United States rose 7% in the quarter ended Aug. 25, driven by the strength of Levi\u2019s flagship brand, while that from wholesale declined 4%.\n\nOverall, the wholesale business grew only 1%, drawing strength from Europe and Asia.\n\nNet income attributable to the company fell to $124.5 million, or 30 cents per share from $130.1 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue and profit came above Wall Street estimates, as the blue-jeans maker also benefited from a resurgence of the denim trend.\n\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned 31 cents per share, 3 cents above expectations. Net revenue rose 3.8% to $1.45 billion, compared with the average estimate of $1.44 billion projected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nShares of the company, which have fallen about 14% since its market debut, were down 0.2% in extended trading.", "description": "Levi Strauss & Co reported a 4% drop in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, as the denim apparel maker struggled to grow its wholesale business in its highest revenue-generating market, the Americas.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438579835&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971OQ-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
