(Yuca is a root vegetable, similar to a potato.)\n\nA 1-ounce bag of Snacklins is 80 calories, about half the amount of regular pork rinds, which impressed the Sharks.\n\n\"I like the lightness,\" Shark Barbara Corcoran said while trying the Snacklins. \"It makes me feel like I'm eating something healthy.\"\n\n\"I must say, the first bite tasted like paper, and now I've had my fourth, I'm starting to dig it,\" Kevin O'Leary said. \"And you know what I really like? I'm only eating 80 calories in a whole bag.\"\n\nShark Lori Greiner added, \"that's what I like!\"\n\nKobrosly initially asked the Sharks for a $250,000 investment in return for a 2.5% stake in the business, a $10 million valuation, which shocked the Sharks.\n\nIn response, Corcoran called Kobrosly a \"cheapskate,\" while Sharks Rohan Oza and O'Leary challenged Kobrosly's thinking.\n\n\"This is the sportiest valuation I've seen in a while,\" Oza said on the show.\n\n\"A $10 million valuation! I hope you have some sales, Samy,\" added O'Leary.\n\nKobrosly told the investors he only owns 30% of the company \u2014 he gave a 10% stake to each original employee, which Cuban called \"awesome,\" and angel investors and family members also have a stake.", "description": "Billionaire Mark Cuban has shown interest in a relatively new market: vegan food products.
