The market was already trading lower and appeared to be on the verge of collapse when it suddenly turned higher.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average\n\nOpened: 25,712 -65\n\nLow: 25,637 -140\n\nClosed: 26,036 +259\n\nThe Dow rallied 400 points intraday on \u201cbad\u201d news. Since then, there have been numerous olive branches, and a much better tone leading up to the next round of trade talks.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average\n\nI still believe Wall Street investors are looking for any breakthrough on trade to happen after the election. There could be a pause in recently announced tariffs and other positive developments. On Tuesday, an article in the South China Morning Post suggested a deal could be made this year that covers 80% of the initial outline.\n\nThe idea of a dual approach was also mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article yesterday.\n\nIt remains to be seen how it all plays out, but China isn\u2019t invincible. The legends of Mao, while offering inspiration, are harder to apply on a thriving middle class than peasants fighting back against oppression. The financial toll is far greater, and the political risk includes Hong Kong protests and Capital flight in the mainland.\n\nWall Street learned to live with tariffs, and stocks were taking off when the latest salvos were announced. The Street would be encouraged with calmer negotiations and stocks could move higher.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\n\nTo me, Jay Powell is a greater risk to the market, in part because the Fed has the power to put hundreds of billions into the economy and take hundreds of billions out of the economy. The Street is looking for a 25-basis point (bps) rate cut at this month\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) gathering. The question is how defensive the Fed chairman will be during the question and answer period.\n\nHis verbal gaffes have caused as much harm as the unnecessary rate hikes in 2018. I think Powell has gotten the message, especially after his European Central Bank (ECB) counterpart made comments about vigorous action to stop the economic slowdown in Europe and do whatever it takes to get more inflation in the system. It would be hard to hear Powell talk cavalierly about transitory issues that have been persistent.\n\nNew Highs Beget New Highs\n\nMajor global fund managers have blown it big time this year, and a year-end rally could wreck careers if these folks continue to watch from afar, sitting on too much cash and overseas stocks. I suspect a breakout in the market will see money pour into the mix. The train leaving the station would gain steam quickly.\n\nYesterday, all but two sectors finished the session higher.\n\nS&P 500 Index +0.29% Communication Services (XLC) +0.29% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +0.48% Consumer Staples (XLP) +0.41% Energy (XLE) -0.62% Financials (XLF) +0.53% Health Care (XLV) -0.03% Industrials (XLI) +0.06% Materials (XLB) +0.78% Real Estate (XLRE) +0.59% Technology (XLK) +0.54% Utilities (XLU) +0.22%\n\nApproach", "description": "On August 28, 2019, something happened in the stock market .09/13/2019 14:09:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/310/23db8761-c673-4e7c-ad86-14662e5c7893.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
