He drove it too easily, that's for sure. We didn't stay in front of him very well down the stretch, but he's a great player. He put it on himself to just take it and attack the rim and he did and we didn't stay in front of him very well.\"\n\nLillard had 28 points, including 18 straight in the final four minutes, as Portland erased a 15-point deficit. The 6-foot-3 guard was limited to 10 points on 3-for-16 shooting through three quarters before going 6 for 12 in the fourth.\n\n\"I'm not going to shy away because of that or try to go away and say, 'Alright, it's just not my night,' \" Lillard said. \"I'm going to empty it and I'm going to go out swinging.\"\n\nHe almost took down San Antonio by himself.\n\nThe Spurs seemed poised for a comfortable win after narrow victories against New York and Washington, but nearly let the game get away by closing out the contest as sloppily as they opened.\n\nLillard took the Blazers on an 18-2 run, capped by a pair of 3s to close within 107-104 with 1:57 remaining. A dunk by Lillard cut the margin to a point, 109-108, with 1:10 left. Lillard and Anthony Tolliver missed consecutive 3-point attempts with Portland trailing 113-100. DeRozan missed a pair of free throws, setting up Lillard's final shot.\n\n\"You can never count a guy like Damian out,\" DeRozan said. \"He could get it going and missed shots are not going to deter him from trying to get it going. You've got to be aware and he got it going. Thank God we got bailed out.\"\n\nSan Antonio outscored Portland 30-27 in the third quarter after scoring just 19 points in the first period.\n\nThe Blazers had a torrid start despite playing on the second night of a back-to-back and escaping with a 121-119 victory in Dallas on Sunday.\n\nCJ McCollum added 27 points for the Blazers (2-2).\n\nDerrick White added 21 points, LaMarcus Aldridge had 15 and Bryn Forbes 14.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nBlazers: Portland had an 11-man roster available, but coach Terry Stotts opted not to play Nassir Little or Gary Trent Jr. ... Former Spurs center Pau Gasol has not played this season for the Blazers as he continues to rehabilitate from left foot surgery in May. ... Bazemore finished with three points and three rebounds in 24 minutes before fouling out.\n\nSpurs: San Antonio has the fewest days with a losing record in the last 23 years, falling under .500 for 65 days. ... The Spurs will play on the road for the first time this season, taking on former San Antonio forward Kawhi Leonard and the Clippers in Los Angeles on Thursday.\n\nSTAYING PUT\n\nPopovich said Dejounte Murray's minutes will remain restricted after he missed last season following right ACL surgery in July 2018.\n\nMurray will not play in back-to-back games and will be limited to about five minutes per quarter. Murray had seven points and eight assists in 22 minutes against the Blazers.\n\nPopovich said he was not tempted to put Murray back in the game in the fourth quarter to help defensively as Lillard went on his 18-point run.\n\n\"No, he's on a minute restriction,\" Popovich said. \"Either he's on a minute restriction or he's not. One game isn't that important to put him out there when the docs feel he shouldn't be.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlazers: At Oklahoma City on Wednesday night.\n\nSpurs: At Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
