On Wednesday morning, it was trading at $77 a share.\n\nNow, Pambakian and Rad's legal team are hoping to have Blatt's defamation suit tossed out of court.\n\nTheir attorney writes that the lawsuit was filed 'solely to launch a public smear campaign against Pambakian and the person who reported the assault to Match Group, Sean Rad.'\n\nThe motion also points out that Blatt is asking for the complaint he publicly filed to be sent to private arbitration.\n\n'This lawsuit is intended to muzzle Rosette and Sean from telling the truth about how Barry Diller and Greg Blatt stole from their employees and covered up sexual assault allegations,' said Rad and Pambakian\u2019s attorney Orin Snyder.\n\n'Unfortunately, unlawful retaliatory lawsuits like this one designed to silence victims and violate their First Amendment rights are all too common in the #metoo era.'\n\nBlatt's attorney Vineet Bhatia was also quick to respond, stating: 'We fully expected this run-of-the-mill, procedural smoke screen to be made by Rad and Pambakian. These arguments are legally wrong and we expect to prevail in Court.'\n\n'The bottom line is, Rad and Pambakian conspired to defame Mr. Blatt and should be held responsible.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nDamaging Diller: Billionaire Barry Diller (above with partner Diane Von Furstenberg) is being accused of covering up sexual assault allegations for his own financial gain\n\nInitial public enemies: Former Tinder executives Sean Rad (right at The Match Group's first day of trading) and Rosette Pambakian are asking a judge to toss a defamation case filed by former CEO Greg Blatt (left) against the two\n\nAllegations: Blatt is suing the pair for $50 million after Pambakian (above) claimed in legal filings that she was sexually assaulted by Blatt, an incident he says was consensual\n\nDiller has bee a fan of Blatt for some time, and selected him to assume his duties as CEO when he stepped down in 2010.\n\nHis name had not found its way into any of the previous filings.\n\nDiller still has a huge vested interest in the company and serves as chairman and senior executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp and Expedia Group.\n\nThese allegations could spell trouble for not only his public image but also his partner, longtime women's rights advocate Diane von Furstenberg.\n\nBlatt claims in court documents that Sean Rad negotiated a multimillion-dollar to Pambakian if she agreed to publicly accuse him of sexual assault.\n\nIn his complaint, Blatt says that Rad grew angry with him when the two men arrived at wildly different valuations for Tinder's stock.\n\nRad 'snapped' according to Blatt, and set out to destroy the CEO for 'interfering with the co-founder's dreams of a lucrative, outsized payout.\n\nThe filing states that he did this in part by recruiting Pambakian, who soon after publicly accused Blatt of sexual assault.\n\nBlatt said the allegation is a lie, and provided texts, emails and other correspondence that he believes back his claim.\n\n'In an email to his financial advisor, Rad wrote: \"F*** him. We\u2019re at war. We will destroy him. This is going to be the biggest lesson of his life. He will be a changed man... excited for him\",' reads the complaint.\n\n'The following week, Rad made a false accusation that Blatt had sexually harassed Pambakian at a Tinder holiday party some five months earlier.'\n\nWhen that failed to gain much traction, Rad asked Pambakian to help him, but she declined to be part of the scheme on two occasions, claims Blatt.\n\nThen, in December 2017, Rad saw his chance when Pambakian became angry about a restructuring at the company that resulted in her reporting to a newly-hired female executive.\n\n'Desperate to recruit Pambakian for his scheme to sue Match and IAC, Rad decided to sweeten the pot to induce Pambakian to join him,' states the complaint.\n\n'Specifically, under the guise of a litigation funding agreement, Rad promised millions to Pambakian in exchange for her joining the Valuation Lawsuit and making false allegations of sexual harassment against Blatt.'\n\nSynder responded to that claim by stating: 'That is false. There were no upfront payments promised for joining the lawsuit. The only payments were triggered by IAC/Match retaliating against plaintiffs by stripping away their hard-earned equity.'\n\nIt was soon after that Pambakian went public with her allegations, which she has continued to stand by to this day.\n\nPambakian, who was Head of Communications, claims that Blatt barged into a hotel room after a 2016 holiday party and began 'forcibly groping [her] breasts and upper thighs, and kissing her shoulders, neck and chest.'\n\nThis all happened 'without [her] consent' according to her lawsuit\n\nShe states in her court filing that she had been hiding from Blatt at the time of the alleged assault, retreating to the room after he said: 'I get hard every time I look at you. Let's get out of here.'\n\nPambakian claims Blatt did apologize, but that her complaint was never fully investigated despite the fact that there were three witnesses present, including his executive assistant.\n\nShe also notes that one day after Rad reported her allegations to executives at IAC and Match Group, 'Blatt exercised approximately 5 million stock options in Match Group, realizing over $44 million in value.'\n\nPambakian claims that for the next two years she was 'marginalized, subject to additional harassment, offensive, and insulting behavior, put on administrative leave, publicly accused of consenting to her attacker\u2019s advances, and finally, wrongfully terminated this past December.\n\nThe company would not comment on this new filing, and instead referred back to a previous statement that addressed these allegations.\n\n'The Match Group Board \u2013 with the assistance of experienced outside counsel from two nationally recognized law firms \u2013 promptly conducted a careful and thorough investigation under the direction of independent Board members, concluded, among other things, that there was no violation of law or company policy, and took appropriate action.'\n\nBlatt tells a markedly different version of events in his court filings.\n\n'On the evening of December 9, 2016, Blatt attended the Tinder holiday party. During the party, Blatt and Pambakian started talking and the conversation turned flirtatious when Pambakian said, \"You have a magnificent chest, Greg Blatt,\"' states the recently filed complaint.\n\n'After that, they had an irreverent and, at times, ribald and suggestive conversation, with Pambakian and Blatt both laughing throughout. Neither of them indicated at any time that they took offense at the other\u2019s comments, and both were enthusiastic participants.\n\n'At some point afterward, Pambakian suggested to Blatt that when the party was over, they find a hotel room to host an after-party.'\n\nBlatt claims that he remained downstairs and spoke with a few employees before joining Pambakian and others in a hotel room.\n\n'For a brief period, Blatt\u2019s and Pambakian\u2019s fully clothed bodies were in contact, and Blatt and Pambakian kissed. The interaction was consensual,' reads the compalint.\n\n'Room service was then delivered. Soon after eating, Blatt departed. While in the hotel room, Blatt and Pambakian were fully clothed at all times.\n\n'After that evening, Pambakian and Blatt never engaged in any further physical encounters.'\n\nMoney: Blatt is accused of sexually assaulting Pambakian, but he claims that this is a lie that was concocted by Rad and Pambakian for monetary gain (l to r: Ryan Ogle, Jonathan Badeen, Sean Rad and Pambakian at Match Group's initial public offering in November 2015)\n\nPambakian and other Tinder executives sued Match and IAC seeking $2 billion a year ago for allegedly bilking them by manipulating financial information to create a lowball estimate of Tinder's value.\n\nShe also detailed the alleged assault in that filing, which the company stated was 'meritless.'\n\nHer claims were later withdrawn however because she and four others had signed an arbitration agreement with the company.\n\n'Just months after cheating Tinder employees out of billions of dollars, IAC / Match tried changing its policies in an attempt to force all current employees out of a public courtroom before a jury and into secret arbitration,' she said at the time.\n\n'IAC / Match did this only after carrying out their scheme. Let me be very clear: IAC / Match will be held accountable and we will continue to support the lawsuit 100% as it unfolds in New York state court.'\n\nThe investigation meanwhile determined that what happened between Blatt and Pambakian was nothing more than 'consensual cuddling.'\n\nAt the same time, Pambakian claims that Blatt asked her to lie about the assault when a reporter from Tech Crunch became aware of the alleged incident.\n\nThe suit states that she informed 'Blatt and Chief Human Resources Officer, Ms. Nelson, about the reporter\u2019s inquiry' into the allegations, and that her 'own perpetrator' told her to instead 'explain the ways Tinder combats sexual harassment, and to throw the reporter off the story.'\n\nBlatt was later asked to resign his post because of the assault, according to Pambakian, who says that Blatt told her she would need to 'sign something' in order for him to be able to stay in his position.\n\nAt the time, she had just refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nShe was placed on leave in August 2018 after she and other employees filed their lawsuit, and were terminated on December 18 via email.\n\n'Upon information and belief, Defendants terminated Plaintiff in retaliation for speaking out against Defendant Blatt for his sexual misconduct and for participating in a lawsuit against the Company Defendants related to her stock options,' states the filing.\n\n'As a result of these actions, Plaintiff was forced to surrender millions of dollars in equity granted to her as compensation for her work as an executive at Tinder.'\n\nPambakian is seeking damages to be determined at trial for eight causes of action, including: Negligence, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Sexual Battery, Gender Violence, Ralph Act Violation, Negligent Misrepresentation, Wrongful Termination and Retaliation for Engaging in Protected Activity.", "description": "Billionaire Barry Diller is being accused of covering up sexual assault allegations in a bid to save one of his most beloved executives and for his own financial gain in a court filing.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/17/19497832-0-image-a-11_1570636821663.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
