No, the circle at Redskins Park is more like Dante\u2019s Nine Circles of Hell.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which circle this is \u2014 maybe lust, maybe heresy, perhaps fraud.\n\nWashington quarterback Case Keenum, Sept. 3, 2019: \u201cWe got some young guys on our side of the ball, but heck, nobody is talking about us, nobody expects much from us. I think it\u2019s a pretty good place to be in, man. I think we got a lot of fight in that locker room, especially on our side of the football. So I\u2019m excited to go out there and show what we\u2019re about.\u201d\n\nWashington quarterback Rex Grossman, to then-CSN Washington, Aug. 9, 2011: \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting in the wings ready to take over the NFC East. Nobody\u2019s talking about us, it\u2019s right where we want to be. You look at us from top to bottom out here, there\u2019s a bunch of great players. And we don\u2019t need people saying we\u2019re the best right now. But when it\u2019s all said and done, I really feel like this team\u2019s going to win the [NFC] East.\u201d\n\nIt seemed to work for Grossman when the season opened in 2011 \u2014 a 28-14 upset win over the New York Giants at home, followed by another win, 22-21 over the Arizona Cardinals. Then, following an 18-16 loss in Dallas to the Cowboys, the Redskins came back with a 17-10 victory over the Rams in St. Louis.\n\nGoing into the bye week, Grossman looked like Nostradamus. His team was 3-1 and leading the NFC East.\n\nThen the roof fell in. I guess people started talking about them then, because Washington won just two of their next 12 games, finishing 5-11.\n\nI guess the answer is to keep people from talking about them, which, given the decimated Redskins fan base these days, should be easy.\n\nNobody is talking about us \u2014 a marketing slogan that now defines this franchise.\n\nSomehow I don\u2019t think Keenum is going to tap into that early Rex Grossman magic.\n\nThe schedule opens with a row of opponents, who, for the most part, might not even have to know they are playing the Redskins, let alone talk about them \u2014 the Eagles in Philadelphia Sunday; Cowboys at Ghost Town Field the following week; the Bears at home Sept. 23 for \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d; the Giants at MetLife Stadium and finally, the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots back at Ghost Town Field, which by then should be as quiet as a funeral home.\n\nThis is a team that will likely survive its way to maybe a 6-10 record, depending on how much of the burden a seemingly strong defense can shoulder. The defense should be better than last year\u2019s, which began to unravel as the season went on. The addition of safety Landon Collins, the drafting of a stud like Montez Sweat and another year under the belts of defensive linemen Jonathan Allen, Daron Payne and Tim Settle should make a good front line better.\n\nBut more will be asked of them.\n\nAnyone who believes that this Redskins offense, under Keenum\u2019s direction, will be better than last year\u2019s must believe that the Redskins were absolute idiots to trade for Alex Smith last year. If anyone argues that Keenum is better than Smith, they should do so in the cone of silence, where Redskins dreams come true.\n\nIf you were paying attention, last year\u2019s offense struggled with Smith at quarterback, a low-scoring unit that, under Smith, kept turnovers to a minimum, and, thanks to a defense and good special teams, often found themselves in good field position.\n\nBut in their 6-3 start, their victories resulted from taking the lead first and never playing from behind. In those three losses, they found themselves playing from behind. Then came the 23-21 loss in Week 11 to Houston, when Smith suffered his gruesome broken leg, and the house of cards collapsed \u2014 Colt McCoy, Mark Sanchez, Josh Johnson and a 7-9 finish.\n\nThe collapse won\u2019t take as long this season, particularly given a shaky offensive line, Trent Williams or not. And, despite the presence of their No. 1 pick quarterback Dwayne Haskins in the wings, the offense will follow the same script as 2018 \u2014 finishing the year with a quarterback who is not even on the roster today.\n\nNobody will be talking about them then, either.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
