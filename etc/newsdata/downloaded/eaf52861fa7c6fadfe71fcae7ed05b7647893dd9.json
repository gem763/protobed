The Labour leader has strong grounds to oppose a no-deal but he could face a backlash from some Labour voters if he is seen as the man who blocks the chance to finally end the Brexit nightmare.\n\n\n\nThe dilemma for Corbyn is that Johnson\u2019s deal - if we get this far - could be far worse than Theresa May\u2019s when it comes to environmental protections and workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\n\nLabour MPs would be right to fear the consequences of Johnson\u2019s deregulation but it could be a hard sell explaining to voters why they yet again voted down a deal.\n\n\n\nCorbyn also knows that if he did back Johnson a sizeable number of his backbenchers would rebel.\n\nAny triumph for Johnson could soon turn into a headache for Corbyn.\n\n\n\nToday's agenda:\n\n\n\nStephen Barclay holds talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels.\n\n\n\n12pm - Tulip Siddiq MP and Richard Ratcliffe to hold a press conference in Westminster today following the return of Gabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe to the UK.\n\n\n\n12.30pm - EU ambassadors updated on state of Brexit talks.\n\n\n\nSNP conference is taking place in Aberdeen.\n\n\n\nWhat I am reading:\n\n\n\nIain Martin in the Times (\u00a3) on why Dominic Cummings has run out of road.", "description": "If Boris Johnson can secure a Brexit deal he will need the support of Labour MPs to get it through Parliament.
