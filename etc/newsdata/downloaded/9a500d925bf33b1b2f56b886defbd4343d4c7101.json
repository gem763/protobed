Elizabeth Warren sought answers Monday about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent Oval Office meeting in light of his platforms agreeing to run controversial advertisements purchased by President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\n\u201cAfter that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on \u2018misinformation\u2019 in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers,\u201d Ms. Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, said on Twitter. \u201cPut another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need accountability,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a series of tweets. \u201cThat should start with Congress and the appropriate state authorities opening investigations and conducting hearings to make Facebook executives explain the company\u2019s policies and practices\u2014under oath.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren has raised concerns about Facebook throughout her presidential campaign, which prominently includes a platform of breaking up \u201cbig tech,\u201d while other Democrats have sounded alarms more recently over the company\u2019s decision not to fact-check political ads placed on its platforms.\n\nNick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president, said late last month that the company does not submit speech by politicians to its independent fact-checkers, adding that: \u201cwe generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic National Committee subsequently complained about Facebook allowing Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign to place millions of dollars worth of ads on its platform containing misleading or blatantly false information about his political opponents. CNN has refused to air some of the same ads, and fellow Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke has referred to one of the spots as \u201cpropaganda.\u201d\n\nMr. Zuckerberg met Mr. Trump at the White House less than two weeks before Mr. Clegg announced publicly that Facebook would not be fact-checking politicians\u2019 speech.\n\n\u201cWhat did they talk about?\u201d Ms. Warren asked on Twitter, noting that Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has since started running \u201cobviously untrue\u201d ads on Facebook.\n\n\u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy\u2014allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections,\u201d said Ms. Warren. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played in that successful attack, nor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for neither Facebook nor the White House immediately returned messages requesting comment.\n\nThe results of several recent national polls have placed Ms. Warren among the top front-runners seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
