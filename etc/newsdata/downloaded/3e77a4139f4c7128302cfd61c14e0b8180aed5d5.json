The German international has shown incredible loyalty to Borussia Dortmund over the years and yet even though he may be a little injury prone, his class and quality continues to shine through.\n\nScoring around a goal every two games for Dortmund is very good going for a winger/forward.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nScoring last weekend in a 2-2 draw against Werder Bremen in a laceless pair of Puma Future 4.1 from the latest Puma Rush Pack.\n\nCheck them out, here .\n\nKevin De Bruyne - Everton v Manchester City, Sep 28\n\nNike Phantom VSN \u2018New Lights\u2019\n\nThe assist king!
