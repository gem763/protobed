But since some of its pages are members-only, the victim might not be able to access them all.\n\nNow, the onus would be on Facebook to find them, Mr Schrems suggested.\n\nFacebook has said countries would have to \"set out very clear definitions on what 'identical' and 'equivalent' means in practice\".\n\nIt said the ruling \"undermines the long-standing principle that one country does not have the right to impose its laws on speech on another country\".\n\nHowever, platforms can be compelled to take down posts worldwide within the framework of relevant international laws only.\n\n\"There's no harmonised defamation law internationally,\" said Prof Peers.\n\n\"Facebook might say we can't do this to the United States, because even though it infringes Austrian law, it doesn't infringe US law.\"", "description": "EU countries can order websites to take down illegal posts worldwide, following a landmark ruling.", "authors": ["Chris Fox", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1869E/production/_109089999_mediaitem109089998.jpg"}
