Engel (D-N.Y.), Pompeo said there is a \u201cwoefully inadequate opportunity for the Department and witnesses to prepare.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed that committee staff have been acting inappropriately in interactions with State Department staff.\n\n\u201cI am concerned with aspects of your request \u2026 that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully and treat inappropriately the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career Foreign Service Officers, whom the Committee is now targeting,\u201d Pompeo wrote. \u201cLet me be clear: I will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.\u201d\n\n10:25 a.m.: Trump\u2019s tweeted electoral map included several errors\n\nA 2016 electoral map tweeted by Trump on Tuesday morning included several errors, depicting some counties that Democrat Hillary Clinton carried as counties that he won.\n\nThe map was intended to show the breadth of Trump\u2019s support as Democrats move toward impeachment.\n\nRead more from an analysis by The Post\u2019s Philip Bump here.\n\n9:20 a.m.: Trump calls for learning \u2018everything about\u2019 the whistleblower\n\nTrump on Tuesday questioned why he is not \u201centitled to interview & learn everything about\u201d a whistleblower who filed a complaint against him and whose identity is protected by federal statute.\n\n\u201cSo if the so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019 has all second hand information, and almost everything he has said about my \u2018perfect\u2019 call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff), why aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThis is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer, warmer, or better.\u201d\n\nAndrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer representing the whistleblower, sent a letter on Saturday to acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire expressing fears for his client\u2019s safety.\n\nIn the letter, Bakaj cited Trump\u2019s remarks last week in which he said whoever gave the whistleblower the information about the call was \u201cclose to a spy\u201d and alluded to the death penalty. Bakaj also said that \u201ccertain individuals\u201d have issued a $50,000 \u201cbounty\u201d for \u201cany information\u201d relating to his client\u2019s identity.\n\nTrump\u2019s contention that the whistleblower has only second-hand information is at odds with a statement released by Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.\n\n9 a.m.: Hillary Clinton calls Trump\u2019s efforts to out the whistleblower \u2018really dangerous\u2019\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee defeated by Trump in 2016, warned Tuesday that his efforts to unmask the whistleblower are \u201creally dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom everything we know, and we don\u2019t know much, this is an experienced person who saw things that bothered him,\u201d Clinton said during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what the whole whistleblower statute is for, and it\u2019s to protect their identity.\u201d\n\n[Hillary Clinton: \u2018Carefully thinking through\u2019 not one of Giuliani\u2019s \u2018strong points\u2019 ]\n\nOn Monday, Trump told reporters that he was trying to \u201cfind out about\u201d the anonymous U.S. intelligence official who filed the complaint. In tweets Sunday night, Trump said he wants to meet his \u201caccuser\u201d and warned of \u201cBig Consequences.\u201d\n\nDuring her ABC appearance, Clinton said she is confident Democrats will not overplay their hand in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think the evidence concerning Ukraine is so dramatic and irrefutable, because it came right out of the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that they will do a thoughtful, thorough job. Nobody should jump to any conclusions.\u201d\n\nClinton is on a tour to promote \u201cThe Book of Gutsy Women,\u201d which she wrote with her daughter, Chelsea.\n\n8:35 a.m.: Giuliani seeks to put focus on Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings\n\nGiuliani sought Monday to focus attention on the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden, complaining that the media has not adequately covered the latter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China.\n\n\u201cHow corrupted is most of our media if they can\u2019t figure out that Ukraine and China was paying for Biden\u2019s office, not his struggling son\u2019s nonexistent expertise,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cEvery time we lecture them on corruption, they laugh and say you\u2019re no different.\u201d\n\n[Trump says Hunter Biden \u2018walks out of China with $1.5 billion.\u2019 Biden\u2019s lawyer said that\u2019s not true.]\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment.\n\nHunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Joe Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nHunter Biden also traveled with his father on Air Force Two to China during his tenure as vice president.\n\nTwelve days later, Hunter Biden joined the board of a just-formed investment advisory firm, known as BHR, whose partners included Chinese entities.\n\n7:15 a.m.: Trump: \u2018Try to impeach this\u2019\n\nTrump pinned to the top of his Twitter feed a largely red 2016 election map with the words \u201cTry to impeach this\u201d emblazoned across it.\n\nThe map appears to depict counties Trump won in red and those carried by Democrat Hillary Clinton in blue. Because Clinton, for the most part, won more densely populated parts of the country, many of them on the coasts, the map appears largely red even though Clinton received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump, who prevailed in the electoral college.\n\n7:10 a.m.: Trump once again claims his call was \u2018PERFECT\u2019\n\nTrump on Tuesday resurrected familiar defenses of his call with Zelensky, calling it \u201cPERFECT\u201d in one of a spate of tweets on the controversy and claiming he is the target of a \u201cHOAX!\u201d\n\nTrump also took fresh aim at Schiff, whom Trump suggested on Monday should be arrested for treason.\n\n\u201cThe congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff\u2019s fraudulently made up version of the call. This is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cThe congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff\u2019s fraudulently made up version of the call,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThis is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!\u201d\n\nIn a statement at a hearing last week, Schiff offered an embellished recreation of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky. Schiff later said that it was meant as parody, which he said should have been obvious to Trump.\n\nDuring morning tweets, Trump also shared television clips of several allies defending him, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\n\nIn a tweet that included a clip of his appearance Monday night on Fox News, Scalise wrote: \u201cRadicals & socialists have taken over the Democrat Party. They\u2019re calling all the shots now. Just last week, they pressured Pelosi into launching a baseless impeachment inquiry based on false rumors & left-wing rage. This is a witch hunt of @realDonaldTrump, plain & simple.\u201d\n\nDuring his Tuesday morning tweets, Trump also touched on a few other topics, including a viral video of an airport cart spinning wildly on the tarmac at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International. In another tweet, he congratulated China on 70 years of Communist rule.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Kamala Harris calls on Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) on Monday night called for Twitter to suspend Trump\u2019s account as he continued his attacks on the whistleblower and told reporters he was trying to \u201cfind out about\u201d the anonymous U.S. intelligence official who filed the complaint.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s tweets and his behavior about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,\u201d Harris, a 2020 Democratic White House hopeful, said during a CNN appearance. \u201cIf you look at what he\u2019s been tweeting today directed at the whistleblower, I frankly think that based on this and all we\u2019ve seen before, including attacking members of Congress, that his Twitter account should be suspended.\u201d\n\n[As Trump lashes out at whistleblower, analysts fear law offers meager protection]\n\nIn his tweets Monday, Trump called the complaint lodged by a whistleblower \u201ca fraud.\u201d In tweets Sunday night, Trump said he wants to meet his \u201caccuser\u201d and warned of \u201cBig Consequences.\u201d\n\n6 a.m.: Inspector general pushes back on claims that whistleblower relied solely on hearsay\n\nAtkinson, the intelligence community inspector general, pushed back Monday on repeated claims by Trump and Republican allies that the whistleblower lacked firsthand knowledge of events and based his claim only on \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Atkinson, a Trump appointee, said it was not true that he found the whistleblower could \u201cprovide nothing more than second-hand or unsubstantiated assertions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the Complainant\u2019s Letter acknowledged that the Complainant was not a direct witness to the President\u2019s July 25, 2019, telephone call with the Ukrainian President, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community determined that other information obtained during the ICIG\u2019s preliminary review supported the Complainant\u2019s allegations,\u201d the statement said.\n\n[Fact Checker: Trump\u2019s false claim that the rules for whistleblowers were recently changed]\n\nAmid a series of tweets on Monday, Trump promoted the false narrative that has been spread by Republicans in recent days that the intelligence community recently eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, firsthand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings. The statute has never required that standard \u2014 a point Atkinson also made in his statement.", "description": "The president and his Republican allies continued to push back against a rapidly moving impeachment inquiry that will include depositions of key figures later this week.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wecfHTHlpy6-pQ8bRJkJzh29BbI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4HVKSIHDXUI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
