Three Russian journalists were killed last year while investigating Wagner activities in the Central African Republic.\n\nWorking with data provided by Facebook, the observatory identified 73 pages that tried to \u201cfoster unity around Russia-aligned actors and politicians\u201d in the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Madagascar, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo. They were liked by more than 1.7 million accounts and had 9.7 million interactions on 48,800 post put up since December.\n\nWhile the pages have been deleted, The Telegraph found similar pages posting paeans in French to Mr Putin and Russian military instructors in Africa.\n\nVladimir Putin greets the president of Mozambique in Sochi last week Credit: Kirill Kukhmar/TASS via Getty More\n\nThe observatory's report analysed 11 Facebook pages run from Egypt boosted Libyan general Khalifa Haftar and Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif while denigrating the UN-backed government of national accord. With names like \u201cVoice of Libya\u201d and \u201cFalcons of the Conqueror,\u201d the pages posted frequently, sometimes sharing the same content.\n\nAn ally of the late Gaddafi, Russia's defence minister hosted Mr Haftar in Moscow this year for talks that Mr Prigozhin also attended.\n\nThe Telegraph reported in March that Wagner mercenaries had been deployed to Libya to back Mr Haftar's forces.\n\nLeaked emails in September appeared to show that Mr Prigozhin's operatives had been advising the general as well as Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and said Russian soldiers were operating in Libya. The emails also said they had created a dozen Facebook pages to curry influence.\n\nFour pages targeting Mozambique posted about the government's supposed success in fighting the Cabo Delgago Islamist insurgency ahead of elections this month.\n\nLocal media reported this week that five Russian Wagner mercenaries had been killed fighting jihadists in Mozambique. The Kremlin denied deploying any troops to the country following reports last month that 200 Russian mercenaries had arrived there.\n\nIn the CAR, 13 pages that Facebook attributed to Mr Prigozhin's companies trumpeted the country's president and Russia while disparaging the UN and colonial power France.\n\nThey also attempted to discredit media reports alleging abuses by Wagner mercenaries in the country, accusing outlets like CNN of \"bribing CAR residents for defamatory material\".\n\nWhile Russia received UN permission to send arms and military advisors to help the CAR government fight rebels, the Wagner mercenaries have reportedly worked on both sides of the lines to develop Russian business interests. A Russian linked to Mr Prigozhin has become the president's security advisor.\n\nThe social media campaign also peddled its content on Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and Telegram.", "description": "A Russia-linked Facebook influence campaign has targeted African countries where Russian military advisors, mercenaries and political consultants are reportedly operating, including Libya and Mozambique, according to cyber threat experts.
