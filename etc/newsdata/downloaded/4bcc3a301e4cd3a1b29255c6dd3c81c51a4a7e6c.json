On Tuesday St Ives council announced Mr Hepher, who lives in the neighbouring village of Needingworth, was banned from the market over social media posts that \u201cappeared to be inciting violence against the town council and its staff\u201d", "description": "Police questioned a farmers\u2019 market cake stall-owner after he was accused of \u201cinciting violence\u201d against the council he blamed for melting his creations.", "authors": ["Mike Wright", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/04/TELEMMGLPICT000211998563-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEDjTm7JpzhSGR1_8ApEWQA1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
