Under the law, drug makers are required to report their price increases quarterly. This is the first report from the law and includes data on drugs that had price increases of 16% or more over their January 2017 prices.\n\nThe hikes in these cases are to the wholesale acquisition cost, which is the list price for wholesalers\u2014they may not reflect how much patients will pay out of pocket. Still, they can add to overall healthcare spending and drive up the costs of insurance.\n\nUnder the 2017 law, drug makers are also required to provide reasons as to why they\u2019re driving up costs.\n\nBetween 2017 and the first quarter of 2019, drug makers reported hundreds of price hikes. The report focuses on trends for a little over a thousand drugs. The median price increase overall was 25.8%. Generic drugs, specifically, had higher increases, with a median rise of 37.6%.\n\nBut some drugs stood out for having exorbitant hikes, as Kaiser Health News pointed out. A liquid version of generic Prozac (fluoxetine) went from $9 to $69 just in the first quarter of 2019\u2014a 667% increase. The reason given was new production costs.\n\nLikewise, a generic medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) called guanfacine, went from about $29 to $87 in the first quarter of 2019, a more than 200% increase.\n\nGuanfacine\u2019s maker, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, also listed production costs as a reason for the hike, as well as \u201cmarket conditions.\u201d\n\nThe data shows that \u201ceven at a time when there is a microscope on this industry, [drug makers are] going ahead with drug price increases for hundreds of drugs well above the rate of inflation,\u201d Anthony Wright told KHN. Wright is the executive director of the California advocacy group Health Access.\n\nWright noted that the new reporting offers progress toward making drug pricing transparent. But critics note that it still doesn\u2019t reveal the true reasons drug makers are raising prices\u2014whether there are drug shortages or changes in competition\u2014and what the changes mean for patients.\n\nThe reporting also faces challenges. The drug-maker industry group, PhRMA, has filed a lawsuit to overturn California\u2019s law. And earlier this month, the state of Nevada issued fines on drug makers for failing to comply with its drug pricing law, which passed in 2017.", "description": "One listed reason for raising prices was \"market conditions.\"", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-450348697-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
