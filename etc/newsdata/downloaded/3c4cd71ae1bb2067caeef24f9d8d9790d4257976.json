The suspect had contact with \u201ccertain individuals of the Salafist movement,\u201d the prosecutor in charge of the investigation said, calling the attack \"premeditated.\"\n\nAccording to a counter-terrorism memo dated October 5, colleagues observed unusual behavior from the 45-year-old IT specialist in the wake of the January 2015 attack on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The memo reveals that the attacker, who had worked at police headquarters for more than 15 years, converted to Islam in 2015.\n\nCastaner will be questioned in the Senate next Thursday about his handling of the investigation and some opposition lawmakers have called on the minister to resign. Guillaume Larriv\u00e9, from the center-right Les R\u00e9publicains party, accused Castaner of failing in his duties and called for him to step down as a \u201cmatter of national security.\u201d\n\n\"Enough is enough. The interior minister is not capable of assuming his responsibilities. He cannot remain in office. This is a matter of national security,\" Larriv\u00e9 said.\n\nBut Castaner told the TV channel TF1 on Sunday: \"Does the question of my resignation arise? The answer is no.\"\n\nCastaner has been in his job for just under a year. He has been heavily criticized for his handling of the Yellow Jackets protests, especially for the violence used by police against demonstrators. In May, the minister admitted that he should not have accused May Day protesters of \u201cattacking\u201d a Paris hospital. Protesters insisted they were seeking refuge from riot police using teargas, and were not targeting the hospital.\n\nThe minister's situation wasn't helped when a video surfaced of him dancing, drinking and kissing in a swanky Paris nightclub hours before a Yellow Jackets protest.\n\nThe spotlight also shone on Castaner after the death of Steve Maia Cani\u00e7o, a 24-year-old who drowned in the Loire River near his hometown of Nantes after a confrontation with police at a music festival. Cani\u00e7o disappeared on the night of June 21, after authorities used teargas to disperse concert-goers whom the prefect of Nantes later claimed were \u201cunmanageable\u201d and had \u201cprobably taken drugs.\u201d In the chaos, more than a dozen people fell into the river and were rescued. Cani\u00e7o, who couldn\u2019t swim, was not.\n\nAfter an August 3 protest in Cani\u00e7o\u2019s home town, Castaner praised \u201cthe police\u2019s engagement\u201d at the rally and commended them for arresting \u201cviolent individuals.\u201d", "description": "Interior minister has faced criticism of his handling of several incidents since he took the job a year ago.", "authors": ["Louise Guillot"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1155562233-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
