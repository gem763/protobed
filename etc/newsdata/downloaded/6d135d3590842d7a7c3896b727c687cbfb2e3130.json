Separately, 113 workers would be laid off for an indefinite period at its construction and forestry plant in Davenport, Iowa.\n\nDeere's shares closed on Tuesday down 1.9% at $165.50.\n\nThe year-long tariff war between the United States and China has slashed the export earnings of American farmers. China imported $9.1 billion of U.S. farm produce in 2018, down from $19.5 billion in 2017, according to the American Farm Bureau.\n\nU.S. shipments to China of soybeans, the country's most valuable farm export, sank to a 16-year low last year as Beijing shifted purchases mostly to Brazil, leaving American farmers with a surplus.\n\nDeere has said it expects industry sales of agricultural equipment to be about the same as last year in the United States and Canada, which account for 60% of its overall business. Sales in the region were earlier projected to be flat to up 5% earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n(This story has been refiled to add dropped letter in paragraph two.)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; Editing by David Gregorio and Matthew Lewis)", "description": "Deere & Co  on Tuesday announced indefinite layoffs for 163 U.S. manufacturing workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa that make agricultural, forestry and construction equipment, citing decreased customer demand.
