This will effectively 'reserve' their speaker.\n\nAfter it's reserved, applicants will get an email to the address associated with their Spotify account where they can then choose the speaker they want.\n\nGoogle will apply a discount code that makes the device free upon check out. (It's worth noting that when MailOnline followed the steps initially, the discount code had not been applied and prompted staff for card information. A second attempt successfully applied the code.)\n\nNew customers must sign up and then follow the process above.\n\nOne notable hitch upon applying is the requirement that users link their Google and Spotify accounts.\n\nSpotify has done similar giveaways in the past but only for members of its more expensive family plan (File photo)\n\nThis provides Google access to playlists, library, and more. It also allows Google to go into one's account and add songs to playlists.\n\nLuckily these privileges can be turned off after the fact by going into one's Spotify account settings, though many users may either forget or fail to recognize that access had been granted.\n\nWhile the Google Home Mini isn't the newest of Google's speakers - it announced the newest Google Nest Mini this month - it's still a pretty great offer for those in the market for a smart device.", "description": "The music-streaming giant announced its second major Google giveaway on Tuesday which is offering a free Google Home Mini, which retails at $49.99, to all of its premium subscribers.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/22/20057492-0-image-a-28_1571781395068.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
