The Simpsons has officially ticked over to episode number 666 overall, and in true late-October fashion they celebrated with a Treehouse Of Horror Halloween episode.\n\nSomehow the stars aligned on The Simpsons episode scheduling, which not only meant the 666th episode fell in October, enabling them to lean right-the-hell in and make it a Treehouse of Horror, but that it also just-so-happened to be the 30th overall Halloween special, making the 666th episode an XXX event.\n\nThe episode parodied Stranger Things, The Shape of Water, The Omen, and Heaven Can Wait, of all things, and the opening sequence of the episode featured yet-another knowing nod towards the show\u2019s FOX network overlords.\n\nBut the real gem of the day came from FOX themselves, who posted a montage featuring a small snippet from every Treehouse of Horror that preceded it. There\u2019s some absolute belters in there, I tell you what.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you smiling at\u201d is one of those absolutely perfect Simpsons gags. A rip-snorter of a line.\n\nSay what you want about The Simpsons lasting this long and continuing on into the foreseeable future, but if the long game of all of this was to have the 666th episode coincidentally land near enough to Halloween for them to pull this off, then honestly? Probably worth all the effort.\n\nProbably.", "description": "The Simpsons reach yet another episode milestone, thanks to their 666th episode, which just-so-happened to be a Treehouse of Horror.
