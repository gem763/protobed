Now, ridesharing giant Lyft wants to help.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cIn response to the planned Bay Area power outages which are slated to impact hundreds of thousands of residents this week, Lyft is committed to doing our part to help those in need,\u201d the company said in a press statement and on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re activating our Wheels For All program to help those in affected areas move to designated resource centers.\u201d\n\nThe program, first launched in January 2018 to help those in need get transportation, will provide free rides to select resource centers in California, including in Napa, Nevada and Santa Clara counties. This will \u201cgive people access to restrooms, bottled water, electronic-device charging and air-conditioned seating,\u201d the company said.\n\nStocks in this Article PCG PG & E CORP. $8.02 +0.23 (+2.95%) LYFT LYFT INC. $39.48 +1.78 (+4.73%)\n\nRides can be accessed using the code \u201cPOWERRELIEF19,\u201d which will be valid for two rides of up to $15 each, and active until Oct. 15 at 11:59 p.m. while rides are available.\n\nLyft is also teaming up with public-service companies, United Way and 211 to offer free rides to people in Ventura and Oakland who meet criteria and are in need of evacuation.\n\nThe planned power outages from PG&E were a precaution to prevent electrical equipment from sparking wildfires as the West Coast experiences heavy winds, which meteorologists said could reach 30 mph and gusts could reach 45 mph or more.\n\nIn all, about 2.5 million people will be temporarily without electricity.\n\nIn some areas, like Berkeley, stores ran out of generators and classes at the university were canceled. In Santa Rosa, authorities reported traffic collisions at intersections without power. Santa Clara County declared a local state of emergency.\n\n\u201cA lot of things are happening \u2014 all converging at once,\u201d Michael Jones, founder and senior energy consultant of California Energy Advisers in Los Angeles, told FOX Business. \u201cYou have a very old grid \u2014 about 127 years old \u2014 which needs constant upgrading.\u201d\n\nWith power outages across the state, several agencies have called for common-sense safety practices, like treating unpowered streetlights as stop signs. Jones has an eye on the future: \u201cI see a need for people to go green,\u201d use solar panel and work to get off the grid.\n\n\u201cThere's no way around it anymore,\u201d he said. Aside from solar power, going green can include installing energy-efficient windows, \"heating and air conditioning, cool paint, water systems \u2014 everything you can put in a house so it produces more energy than it uses.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFor now, though, those affected by the outages can check in with PG&E for updates.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are with those affected by the wildfires in Southern California,\u201d Lyft tweeted.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\u201cOur hearts are with those affected by the wildfires in Southern California,\u201d the company tweeted.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
