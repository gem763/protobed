NOAA is part of the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House committee on science, space and technology is investigating Ross's actions.\n\nKathy Sullivan, a former NASA astronaut who headed up NOAA between 2014 and 2017, spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the controversy. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nWhat did you think when you saw those two statements [from Trump and the National Weather Service in Birmingham]?\n\nThe forecast office, by my understanding, did not know what the president had tweeted. All they knew was that suddenly their switchboards lit up with worried citizens in Alabama calling in asking questions.\n\nA forecast that says you're in danger when you're not can be as dangerous as the reverse because it does not take many incidents of that sort to condition a population to just not bother and not respond to the warnings that come out.\n\nSo it was not only instinctual, but so scientifically sound and according to policy for that weather forecast office in Birmingham to very rapidly quash what was clearly an utterly incorrect statement about the weather.\n\nOnly later did they realize the source of it.\n\nThese contradictory tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump and the National Weather Service in Birmingham both came out on Sept. 1 (Twitter)\n\nBy Friday, NOAA issued a statement that the Birmingham National Weather Service's Sunday-morning tweet spoke in \"absolute terms\" and they were \"inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\" ... What did you make of that?\n\nThat someone had been put under tremendous political pressure, one of the higher-ups at NOAA. That they had caved to that pressure rather than defending the scientific integrity of the agency's product and workforce.\n\nI found it disingenuous, rather mealy mouthed.\n\nSo why do you think that NOAA issued that statement?\n\nAgain, I presume they were put under tremendous political pressure.\n\nThe president wants people in what he considers to be his personal agencies to defend him, not contradict him. And someone was pressured to make NOAA fix it.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump holds an outdated and seemingly altered forecast map as he defends his statements about Hurricane Dorian threatening Alabama. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nThe New York Times is reporting now that the Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross threatened to fire those political appointees at NOAA, if they didn't fix this. And today the paper's reporting the White House told Mr. Ross to get NOAA to disavow its own forecasters. What do you make of that?\n\nI think the signs are clear that significant political pressure was brought to bear from on high, on probably Neil Jacobs, [acting administrator of] NOAA.\n\nAnd the track record, the statement that was issued, makes clear that Mr. Jacobs decided to cave in and give in to his obligation to try to make the president happy, rather than stand up to his constitutional obligation to support the scientific integrity of the agency.\n\nNeil Jacobs gave a speech Tuesday morning in which he said that the point was only to clarify technical aspects when they issued the clarification, that he said there is no pressure to change the way you communicate forecast risk in the future. He's saying this to the employees of NOAA. And so he seems to be trying to find a way to patch things over. What do you make of that?\n\nI found the statements that were reported very unconvincing. ... You're either standing on principle and really defending that principle, or you're not. And in my view, the statement of last week did not defend that principle. It was a caving-in.\n\nHe also said in the speech, \"This is hard for me. This is hard for my friends [and] my family. ... I'm the same Neil I was last Thursday.\" Do you feel sorry for him?\n\nI've had high-level jobs \u2014 his job and a job higher than that. I understand what it's like to be under pressure of various sorts when issues get tough and complex. So I have a certain degree of sympathy.\n\nBut, you know, he chose this course of action, and the courses of action and choices we make have consequences.\n\nSo I can imagine it would be hard having, again, failed to stand up for your people, to then show up a few days later and try to stand in front of them and claim again to be their leader. The trust, the significant bond of trust, was badly damaged.\n\nTrust is like fine glass. It shatters in an instant with one blow, and it is not rapidly repaired. Times were tough, things were difficult, the high stakes were high, and you were not there for me. And then you show up on Tuesday and say, \"I still love you and I'm the guy I was before\"? Pretty hollow.\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear with files from The Associated Press. Interview produced by Katie Geleff.
