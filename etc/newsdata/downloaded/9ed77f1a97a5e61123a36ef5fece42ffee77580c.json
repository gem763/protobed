They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\"\n\nTulsi Gabbard called Hillary Clinton the \"queen of warmongers\" Credit: AFP More\n\nMrs Clinton did not mention Ms Gabbard by name, but a spokesman later confirmed she had been referring to Ms Gabbard.\n\nThe spokesman said: \"This is not some outlandish claim, this is reality.\"\n\nMs Gabbard is a military veteran who served in Iraq. She caused controversy after revealing that she had met with Bashar al-Assad on a fact-finding trip to Syria.\n\nResponding to Mrs Clinton's allegations she said: \"Thank you Hillary Clinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.\"\n\nShe accused Mrs Clinton of being behind a concerted campaign to derail her candidacy.\n\nMs Gabbard added: \"It was always you, through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\"\n\nThe congresswoman urged Mrs Clinton to run again in 2020. She said: \"Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\"\n\nDuring the latest televised Democrat debate in Ohio this week Ms Gabbard condemned suggestions of Russian support for her.\n\nShe said: \"This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\"\n\nMrs Clinton also accused Jill Stein, the Green Party presidential nominee in 2016, of being a \"Russian asset\".\n\nIn 2016 Ms Stein received about one per cent of the vote but some Democrats claim that helped Donald Trump win several key states.\n\nMs Stein denied Mrs Clinton's accusations and accused her of \"peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure, instead of reflecting on real reasons the Democrats lost in 2016.\"", "description": "Hillary Clinton has claimed a Democrat presidential candidate is being \"groomed\" by the Kremlin to run as an independent in 2020.
