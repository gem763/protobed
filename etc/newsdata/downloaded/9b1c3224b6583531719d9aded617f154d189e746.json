South Vietnamese government officials were taken captive, imprisoned, exiled or executed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoufan\u2019s comments in an interview for Yahoo News\u2019 \u201cSkullduggery\u201d podcast came just hours before the Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide car bombing in Kabul on Thursday morning that killed a U.S. service member.\n\nIt was the Taliban\u2019s second terror attack in the Afghan capital in the last three days, the latest sign that the group seems determined to continue its insurgency despite the announcement by lead U.S. negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad on Sunday that he had reached an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d with the Taliban to begin U.S. troop withdrawals. The U.S. has been fighting in Afghanistan since shortly after the 9/11 attacks, first to oust the Taliban, and subsequently to support the new government and keep the Taliban from returning to power. There are around 14,000 U.S. troops there, and more than 2,200 Americans have been killed there since the conflict began \u2014 including three in the last week.\n\nIt is a deal, still pending President Trump\u2019s approval, that was reached in the latest round of talks in Doha, Qatar, from which the Afghan government has been excluded.\n\nDownload or subscribe on iTunes: \u201cSkullduggery\u201d from Yahoo News\n\nSoufan said the Taliban\u2019s refusal to negotiate with Afghan officials \u2014 or participate in planned elections \u2014 was a sign that the group feels emboldened and has no intention of abandoning its bid to regain control of the country and restore its version of Sharia, or strict Islamic law.\n\n\u201cRemember what happened to Najibullah when the Taliban took Kabul and how they hung him from a lamppost?\u201d said Soufan, referring to the Soviet-allied president of Afghanistan, Mohammad Najibullah, who was executed after the Taliban initially seized control of the capital in 1996.\n\nSuch scenes could be repeated given the Taliban\u2019s renewed strength in the country, he told Yahoo News.\n\n\u201cThey control more provinces in Afghanistan than anytime since 2001. They are in a position of power today,\u201d Soufan said. \u201cSo now how are we going to bring the Afghani government to the table? How are we going to convince the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghani government? How are we going to convince the Taliban to participate in an election, right? Because if they don\u2019t want an election, that means they want a hostile takeover of the government, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen if they don\u2019t agree on a lot of these things.\u201d\n\nA CIA employee helps Vietnamese evacuees onto a helicopter from the top of a building near the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, April 1975. (Photo: AP) More\n\nSoufan\u2019s comments echo the concerns of many national security experts and some U.S. officials, including White House national security adviser John Bolton, who has been sidelined from the U.S.-Taliban talks and was reportedly even denied a request for a copy of the draft peace deal by Khalilzad.\n\nSoufan emphasized that, as much as anybody, he would like to see U.S. troops withdrawn from Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting. But he added that a hasty withdrawal, without the participation of the Afghan government, the various ethnic groups in Afghanistan and foreign countries with influence there, including Pakistan, China and Russia, is a prescription for failure.\n\n\u201cI feel we will just be betraying the people who put all their eggs in our basket,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we pull out by surrendering our power to the Taliban, that is going to weaken American influence in the region for decades to come.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "\u201cIf we continue the negotiations only between us and between the Taliban, that is not a withdrawal \u2014 that is another Saigon,\u201d Ali Soufan told Yahoo News' \"Skullduggery.\"", "authors": ["Michael Isikoff", "Chief Investigative Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VkzZFDts2e.Khyp3gI0bWA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/41e79df0-cffb-11e9-bf7b-9c4943043f4c", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
