Priyanka Vadra\u2019s revamp of UP Cong unit has made many restless and long for Rahul", "language": "en", "text": "It seems more and more Congress leaders are getting nostalgic about the time when Rahul Gandhi was at the helm of affairs in the Congress\u2014his open, collaborative approach to party work. Recently when senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid made a pitch about how it was becoming unacceptable for Congress rank and file that Rahul Gandhi should \u201d walk away\u201d accepting responsibility for 2019 Lok Sabha rout at a time when the party was fighting an important ideological battle with the BJP. it struck a chord with many Congress leaders, particularly those from Uttar Pradesh.\n\nParty sources said Khurshid\u2019s comment, was well received as it came on a day when Uttar Pradesh Congress leaders were shocked by the kind of unilateral changes that were made in the state Pradesh Congress Committee\n\nIt was felt Khurshid as former UP Pradesh Congress president was speaking up on appointment of a very junior \u2013Ajay Kumar Lallu as UPCC President. Lallu\u2019s appointment had particularly stunned everyone. In fact, UP leaders are glad that Khurshid had at least flagged the right kind of concern about leadership in the state. Lallu\u2019s predecessor was actor Raj Babar. Lallu\u2019s appointment led to a lot of panning of decision-making by Priyanka Vadra as AICC general secretary. It is being compared with the way her brother worked in UP.\n\n\u201cEveryone in UP Congress is shocked with Priyanka Vadra\u2019s decision. We are surprised how could a Gandhi have even opted for this Ajay Lallu guy. UPCC President is a prestigious office. It was once held by Nehru, Indiraji a Rita Bahuguna Joshi. What is the point of appointing Lallu? He just came into our party recently. Does BJP ever hand over its party apparatus in any state to an outsider\u201d asked a Gandhi family loyalist?\n\nAn OBC leader and a two-term MLA belonging to Kushinagar, Lallu\u2019s rise in the party set-up has not only came as a surprise but rankled quite a few established leaders. \u201c Until recently he was the leader of the Congress Legislature Party. As long he was heading the legislature party\u2013 he was heading a group of 7 MLAs, it didn\u2019t bother us. But to move into party hierarchy is worrisome, \u201csaid the UP leader.\n\nPriyanka has more than just changed one person- \u2013she has revamped the UP set-up, upsetting so many in the state that many UP Congress has already begun to long for a Rahul Gandhi comeback. \u201c We do not know who advised Priyankaji on this revamp. She comes to Lucknow and hangs out with her own coterie. She moved Lallu to the UPCC and made senior leader Pramod Tewari\u2019s daughter Mona Misra as CLP leader. Congressmen will now stop visiting the UPCC office, \u201cwarns a party leader.\n\nIt is interesting in this backdrop that is not just frontline leaders like Khurshid who have wished Rahul returns back at the helm in 24, Akbar Road once again. Even the second line leaders want a more amenable Rahul is back at work", "description": "It seems more and more \u00a0Congress leaders are getting nostalgic about the time when Rahul Gandhi was at the helm of affairs in the Congress\u2014his open, collaborative approach to party work.
