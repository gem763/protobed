I can be Jean Harlow!\u2019\n\nSimon then suggested they use some of her wigs, prompting Jackie to say: \u2018Oh, do get Jim to ask Alec.\u2019\n\nBaldwin, who had been in a relationship with future wife Kim Bassinger at the time was shocked by the invite, writes Simon.\n\nBaldwin in the same grey coat as the photo above\n\n\u2018Jackie Kennedy wants to go on a date with me?\u2019 he said at the time.\n\n\u2018Are you kidding?\u2019\n\nHe then asked what to wear, and for more details about the play they would be seeing - a tale of five spinster sisters living on the Irish coast.\n\nWhen the big night rolled around, Simon cooked for everyone and before dessert handed out the wigs.\n\nHart wore a \u2018long, curly Eddie Van Halen wig,\u2019 Baldwin a \u2018short brown one\u2019 and Simon one that was \u2018Grand Ole Opry-esque.\u2019\n\nLast to pick was Jackie, who selected a wig \u2018befitting Madame de Pompadour.\u2019\n\nThe wigs did not serve any real purpose in the end however writes Simon, since the person whose identity they were trying to conceal - Jackie - dashed out in her limo ahead of the group and was wigless in the theater when they arrived.\n\nPhotos suggest however that the other three had their fun, and that Carly gave Baldwin her wig and grabbed Jackie\u2019s on the way out.\n\n\u2018First thing next morning, Jackie called to tell me what a magical evening it was, how divine Alec was, and how important she felt it was to think and act and cavort like a child now and again,\u2019 writes Simon.\n\nA few years later, Baldwin married Bassinger. And a few decades later, he too found himself besotted with someone half his age.", "description": "Carly Simon writes in her book Touched By the Sun that Jackie enjoyed one\u00a0'magical night' with Alec Baldwin, with the pair joining the singer and her then-husband for a night out on the town.", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20084332-0-image-a-14_1571837344828.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
