People have that negative reaction to seeing anything about the intelligence agency, about the CIA, but they\u2019re making an assumption. What we\u2019ve tried to do is speak to the better part of humanity and how that influences what we do.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the same thing with Meghan. I choose to focus on her patronage of the arts, of the charities, of the abused women, of underserved communities.\n\n\u2018She was just at a charity in South Africa with a surfing school for at risk kids \u2014 taking the natural world as a connection for something that could actually help these kids make that the next step in their lives to a better future.\n\n\u2018I choose to focus on that. The negative press is just an example of the ugly side of human nature, and she\u2019s actually showing us when they take the low road, she takes the high road. By demonstrating that, she shows the better part of ourselves.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018That\u2019s a real part of our humanity and she\u2019s showing you how to deal with it. So actually, by example she\u2019s doing really well.\u2019\n\nWendell Pierce stars in the new series of Jack Ryan (Picture: Rex)\n\nWendell has also invited Meghan to see him perform on the West End in play Death Of A Salesman, which is preparing for a second run at the Piccadilly Theatre.\n\n\u2018Since I\u2019ve been here in London doing a play, I\u2019ve commented with her and she sends word back,\u2019 Wendell said. \u2018She was having a baby for the first half of the year, so hopefully I\u2019ll see her on the second half of my run.\u2019\n\nAlong with a West End play, Wendell is gearing up for the second season of Jack Ryan, which also stars John Krasinski and newcomers Michael Kelly and Noomi Rapace.\n\nJack Ryan season two releases 1 November on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nMORE: John Krasinski on reinventing Tom Clancy\u2019s Jack Ryan and meeting the real CIA\n\nMORE: John Krasinski becomes fifth actor to play Jack Ryan in new Amazon series", "description": "Wendell Pierce has spoken out against the negative press around former Suits co-star Meghan Markle.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wendell-pierce-meghan-markle-main-9ea3_1571596817.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
