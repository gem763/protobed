We cannot give into fatalism. At least, I will not stop dreaming about a better and united Europe.\u201d\n\nHis words prompted a sharp response from Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit representative: \u201cI am against Brexit \u2013 leaving the EU \u2013 but it is not our decision. It was a decision of the British people.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Tusk, in effect, saying: \u201cGive those troublesome Brits a second chance\u201d; Verhofstadt saying: \u201cLeave it, Donald, they\u2019re not worth it.\u201d\n\nBut Tusk is right. He sees more clearly than his more ideological colleague that our failure to leave the EU on time is an opportunity for the dreamers dreaming of a united Europe. He realises that the British parliament is unlikely ever to agree the terms of our departure. He knows that neither a new prime minister nor a general election is likely to change that.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In the end, any prime minister who tried could be brought down and replaced by someone who would ask for a further extension.\n\nAnd would a general election result in the return to Westminster of more than 320 MPs committed to a no-deal Brexit? Tusk knows it would not. He also knows, because it is his job to coordinate the responses of EU leaders, that, having granted the UK an extension twice, they will do so again. They do not want to be blamed for the dislocation and economic damage \u2013 especially to Ireland \u2013 of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nWhich means that those who want to stop Brexit have the chance to dream. The long extension gives Britain the chance to plan for another referendum \u2013 as the only way to resolve the three-way split in the country, reflected in the Commons, between the deal, a no-deal exit and staying in the EU.\n\nAnd if EU leaders do not want to be accused of being \u201cdreamers\u201d, they can make a practical argument. If Britain is never going to leave, it will need another referendum at some point to legitimise that decision. The alternative is to drift indefinitely, staying in the EU by repeated extensions without ever admitting that this is what we are doing.\n\nVerhofstadt said: \u201cWhat my fear is, is that instead of killing Brexit the decision could risk killing Europe, at least bog it down again for years, putting our energy in negotiations with British leaders like Mr Corbyn or Mr Johnson, who in their heart despise Europe.\u201d\n\nBut that quagmire would be worse if Britain were still pretending it was trying to leave. If we decided to stay, in a Final Say referendum, there might be a heavy price to pay in the short run for the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the 2016 vote \u2013 but it would be the only way to allow the EU as a whole to move on to more important things.\n\nIt is not up to EU leaders to tell us how to run our affairs, but Tusk is right that they should give us the time \u2013 and every encouragement \u2013 to hold another referendum to put an end to the deadlock.", "description": "Donald Tusk, the European Council\u00a0president, told the European parliament today that Brexit can be stopped, and that the postponement to October could give the British time to \u201crethink\u201d \u2013 implying support for a new referendum.", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/16/13/Donald-Tusk.jpg"}
