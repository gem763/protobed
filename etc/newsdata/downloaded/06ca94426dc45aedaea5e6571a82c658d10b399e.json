The game went ahead as scheduled after organizers completed a safety assessment at the venue early Sunday, and Japan won 28-21 to continue its unbeaten run and top the group.\n\nWorld Rugby tournament director Alan Gilpin told a news conference Tuesday that \u201ccomments and behaviors\u201d of the Scottish Rugby Union had been referred to an independent disputes committee.\n\nIn a statement later Tuesday, Rugby World Cup confirmed the charges, saying it would make no further comment pending the outcome.\n\nUnder tournament rules, group matches cannot be postponed. In the case of canceled games, both teams are awarded two competition points and the score is registered as 0-0. Three games were cancelled, including the Pool B game between defending champion New Zealand and Italy, and the Pool C decider between England and France.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rugby World Cup organizers have issued misconduct charges against the Scottish Rugby Union over comments made about the potential cancellation of its last group-stage match against Japan last weekend, when the destructive Typhoon Hagibis left dozens of people dead.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_japan_scotland_12629_c0-184-4430-2768_s1200x700.jpg?1362fc89bae502924e61c0ff1bb07954d1cc5716", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
