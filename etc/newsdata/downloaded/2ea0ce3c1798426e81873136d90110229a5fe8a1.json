That fact is strikingly borne out by Motherless Brooklyn, a star-studded detective tale whose action has been relocated from the 1990s of its source material (Jonathan Lethem\u2019s acclaimed 1999 novel) to 1957, and whose depiction of political and social treachery is deeply rooted in our present Trumpian day. The closing night selection of this year\u2019s New York Film Festival (and in theaters Nov. 1), it\u2019s a portrait of the old boss as the new boss as every boss, presiding over a world in which power is wielded ruthlessly, and compassion, love and justice are in dire danger of being trampled underfoot.\n\nAsk Motherless Brooklyn\u2019s writer/director/star Edward Norton about the parallels shared by his period piece and our current corruption-plagued circumstances, and he concedes that his latest look at the damage wrought by amoral, unchecked government elites is all too relevant. Nonetheless, any direct comparisons end there, since his film\u2019s villain, Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin)\u2014inspired by real-life NYC visionary and tyrant Robert Moses\u2014is a brilliant man, unlike the current Oval Office occupant, whom Norton refers to only as \u201cthis insane clown charlatan.\u201d\n\nBaldwin\u2019s Randolph is the black heart of Motherless Brooklyn, looming large over its story about a fledgling private eye named Lionel (Norton) who, following a tragedy, finds himself drawn into a mystery involving a variety of enigmatic characters\u2014played by the likes of Willem Dafoe, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael K. Williams and Bruce Willis\u2014whose paths crisscross in a New York City undergoing radical urban-planning change. And did I mention that Lionel has Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and is thus prone to blurting out inappropriateness in great, uncontrollable bursts?\n\nIn Norton\u2019s hands, Lionel is a unique protagonist in a familiar noir milieu. And both the character and his saga\u2014indebted, most heavily, to Chinatown and L.A. Confidential\u2014are emblematic of the idiosyncratic challenges that have typified the Primal Fear, Fight Club, American History X and 25th Hour actor\u2019s career. Having worked on it for the better part of two decades, Norton\u2019s adaptation is clearly a passion project. It was thus no surprise that, sitting down with us a day before its NYFF premiere, he was enthusiastic about discussing the film and a host of related topics: its ties to our contemporary political reality; the difficulty of making adult movies in the age of Marvel domination; Steven Spielberg\u2019s critique of Netflix; and what he views as the potentially fatal shortcoming of the theatrical moviegoing experience.\n\nMotherless Brooklyn is a narratively and thematically packed film. Has that made talking about it more difficult?\n\nWhen you get into this process, it\u2019s like many things in life: you have to decide what gear you want to be in. If you enter it exhausted or cynical, it\u2019s going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I think you have to look at it as an extension of the reason you made the film in the first place. In the case of something like this, obviously this is film isn\u2019t in the category of a Xanax. It is, I hope, something that activates. You want it to activate empathy, activate the questioning of, wait, did these things really happen? And is it possible that there was that much power outside the system it\u2019s supposed to be in? You have to look at the chance to talk about it as the same quest: to activate the conversation about things. That\u2019s fun, and positive, and an extension of the same original impulse.\n\nIt\u2019s a full film.\n\nIt\u2019s like a five-course meal instead of a Big Mac.\n\nMotherless Brooklyn\u2019s portrait of a cruel, racist 1950s NYC tyrant feels directly connected to today. I know you\u2019ve been developing the film for close to 20 years. Did you ever envision it being this timely?\n\nNo. I finished writing it in 2012\u2014not that I didn\u2019t work on it after, but I finished it in 2012 with most of it, including Alec Baldwin\u2019s big soliloquy at the end, very much written as such. I felt that the fundamental emotional hook of Lionel, and this journey of a person who we can empathize with (or maybe even see ourselves in, in the sense that he\u2019s lonely and misunderstood) having to grow up a little bit, and become his mentor, and realize he has to get over his own shit in a way\u2014that cohered. The emotional journey of him and his growth was, I hoped, timeless in a way. Or human.\n\nI had moments where I had this shock of realization that it\u2019s a true thread in American life that there\u2019s this shadow narrative that goes on under the public narrative of who we say we are. And that there are stories\u2014the fact that L.A.\u2019s built on stolen water, and that in New York, there was a history, for nearly half a century, of an authoritarian dictator essentially running the biggest and most important city in America (because everyone modeled themselves on it) through the prism of his racism and his brutality and, actually, his disdain for human beings.\n\nThis idea, about the power that\u2019s hidden, or unseen, and the danger and consequences and losses that can be incurred from that\u2026 Obama was getting inaugurated for term two, and I was like, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s all in the rearview mirror! [Laughs] We\u2019re entering post-racial utopia, and everyone\u2019s going to be like, sure it might have happened then, but there\u2019s nothing to that now!\u201d And then in the spring of 2017, Toby Emmerich, who\u2019s running Warner Brothers and had been a great champion of this, was like, \u201cI\u2019m just calling because I think this is the year we need to make this film. I\u2019m feeling that there\u2019s a reason that it\u2019s waited, and this is the now, and we have to figure this out.\u201d\n\nMoses obviously shares similarities with Donald Trump. And he\u2019s portrayed by Alec Baldwin, who of course plays Trump on Saturday Night Live. Did you have to take that dynamic into account?\n\nNo, no. There are two dimensions to that. First of all, I think the character Alec plays in this movie is, in anything other than a glancing analysis, an entirely different beast than this insane clown charlatan [i.e. Trump]. He\u2019s based on a m\u00e9lange of a couple of people\u2014one in particular\u2014who were geniuses. Like, who really were the equivalent of Anakin Skywalker going to the dark side. A true Jedi knight. To me, that\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t want to be pretentious and say Shakespearean, but the idea of someone of enormous capability, this brilliant mind that could grasp the complexities of society, going to the dark side and doing damage instead of good\u2014that\u2019s really what we\u2019re dealing with.\n\nIn many ways, Willem Dafoe plays Obi-Wan Kenobi. He\u2019s the Jedi in rags, not seen as the Jedi that he is, and you realize that there\u2019s been this dark history, and that their relationship is the loss of his ally, the loss of his fellow Jedi. These things were very compelling.\n\nSo casting Baldwin in light of his SNL gig didn\u2019t give you any pause?\n\nI didn\u2019t really hesitate in terms of Alec. Alec is one of the great comedic actors of modern times, and in particular, he has this capacity to weaponize his satirical abilities against power\u2014and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an overstatement to say that\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing. He\u2019s been doing the thing that tyrants hate the most, which is mocking them. Thank God you can still do that in the United States. Doing what he\u2019s doing in Russia will get you killed, literally. I don\u2019t think it should be glibly treated; I think what he\u2019s been doing is bold.\n\n\u201c Alec [Baldwin] is one of the great comedic actors of modern times, and in particular, he has this capacity to weaponize his satirical abilities against power\u2014and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an overstatement to say that\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing. \u201d\n\nBut all that said, I came up on Glengarry Glen Ross Alec, and I saw him in A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway when I was in my twenties, and he has always, to me, as a dramatic actor, had this gravitas, this very rare basso profundo. He has real heft, like a Brian Dennehy or a Lee J. Cobb or a Marlon Brando. He has that thing that not a lot of people have, which is that real force. \u201cCoffee is for closers only\u201d\u2014that is like a logline for a lot of us. You think about how many times people will use that as the maxim of, \u201cPut that down, I\u2019m the boss!\u201d So to me, there was no question in my mind that this guy who says things like, \u201cIf someone wants to try to jack me, then the Dodgers can take on the arches to the fucking coast\u201d\u2014you can\u2019t hear that many people saying that with authority. With him, I could. Furthermore, he has a Shakespearean actor\u2019s command of language. He can take that soliloquy at the end and drive through it like one dark thought. So I was very hung up on the idea of him.\n\nHe also fits into this ensemble, which is full of actors with forceful, weighty presences. They help keep audiences engaged even when they may feel like they\u2019re operating behind a complex story.\n\nIt\u2019s what you said at the beginning: if you\u2019re going to ask people to eat a complex multi-course meal, then what shows up along the way better be good. With actors like that, they\u2019re able to take text and complex, mature thoughts, and make a grown-up audience go, I\u2019m going to stay with this because these people hold me, step by step. I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on here, but these people show up\u2014Michael K. Williams, whomever\u2014and you go, what is this, holy shit!\n\nI think that\u2019s sometimes how the best of these work. You don\u2019t remember the plot of L.A. Confidential in the slightest. I couldn\u2019t today tell you what happens in that film. But what I remember, as an audience member, is that about three minutes in, something in your brain flips and you go, these are good, really mature actors. There\u2019s no tongue-in-cheek in this; this isn\u2019t Gangster Squad, we\u2019re not doing period clich\u00e9. They\u2019re in it all the way, the music is great, the picture looks friggin' fantastic, and I\u2019m just in. You get to that place where you go, I\u2019m just happy to be here, inside the seriousness with which they\u2019ve treated this. And then you just go.\n\nI get confused when I hear people pulling out the question of whether something\u2019s convoluted. There\u2019s not one good detective film that\u2019s not convoluted\u2014like, not a single one. And indeed, getting lost in the murk is part of the experience, because what you\u2019re going through is the idea of the unknowability of certain things, and in some cases, you\u2019re being purposely taken down a false path so you can be, like in Chinatown, literally 95 percent of the way through the movie without knowing what\u2019s really going on. Then when you finally figure it out in the last eight minutes of the movie, it\u2019s not at all what you thought it was going to be. That\u2019s what you remember. I don\u2019t think 99 out of 100 people could narrate what the mechanism of Chinatown\u2019s crime is; they remember, \u201cShe\u2019s my sister and my daughter, my father and I,\u201d the nickel job, and L.A. is built on stolen water. That\u2019s it. But what\u2019s the pleasure of that film? It\u2019s the hypnosis of it. The pure hypnosis.\n\nThis is a big-studio drama for adults, which makes it somewhat rare\u2014and puts it on one side of the divide that Martin Scorsese recently raised in his comments about Marvel movies being \u201ctheme parks\u201d and not \u201ccinema.\u201d Has that division grown wider, and has it made it tougher to get films like Motherless Brooklyn produced?\n\nYeah, sure. But I want to be careful. At the same time, I\u2019m always a little leery of ever discussing these things that could be mistaken for griping about it. Because to be super clear, I would say that today, as a creative person who\u2019s interested in telling stories, there has never been more opportunity to get original and diverse visions of a narrative across to other people\u2014ever, in the history of American cinema, television, whatever you want to call it. Not even in the mid-to-late-\u201890s, when Miramax created this new flowering of opportunity because all the other studios realized, we better make lower-budget auteur-driven things, and we all got to make Being John Malkovich and Magnolia\u2026\n\n...And Fight Club.\n\nYeah, a whole bunch of films got made at studios that would have had to vie for the chimera of independent finance, because Miramax forced the studios to revisit a different part of the business model, and all of us coming up in that era got to make this incredible wave of films. This is 10x that level of opportunity, and no one should ever say, is it harder than ever? No, it\u2019s easier than ever to tell complex, long-form, character-driven stories.\n\nIf I disagreed with anybody, with great respect, it was [Steven] Spielberg [regarding his critical comments about Netflix posing a danger to movies]. Netflix invested more in Roma theatrically\u2014theatrically\u2014than any boutique label at any studio would have by a factor of five. They put a Spanish-language black-and-white film all over the world in theaters. Hundreds of theaters, not just a few; as many as Sony Pictures Classics would have done. They put more money behind it, in a theatrical context, than anybody would have. You can\u2019t tell me there\u2019s a whole lot of people making black-and-white Spanish-language films and putting that investment behind them. And you can\u2019t tell me that there\u2019s a lot of places making five-part documentaries about the Central Park Five.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on because of Netflix, and what it was the vanguard of, that represents an unprecedented period of ripe opportunity for many more types of stories and voices to be heard, and told, and celebrated. It\u2019s incredible, what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201c There\u2019s a lot going on because of Netflix, and what it was the vanguard of, that represents an unprecedented period of ripe opportunity for many more types of stories and voices to be heard, and told, and celebrated. It\u2019s incredible, what\u2019s going on. \u201d\n\nBut that boom has also coincided with a shrinking theatrical market for movies like yours.\n\nI think what\u2019s a challenge, but an elective challenge, because I chose to embrace it, is that the traditional model of making an original adult drama in the studio theatrical releasing configuration is rarer. But let\u2019s be clear: I could have turned around and made Motherless Brooklyn with any of the streaming services in five minutes. With this cast? In five minutes. And by the way, instead of for $26 million and with 46 days to shoot it, and everybody taking scale, I could have probably fattened that up and gotten everybody paid, you know what I mean?\n\nWhy not go that route?\n\nI did it the way I did it because I retained my own aspiration while the sun is still up on this model to make an old-fashioned type of movie that I love. Like L.A. Confidential, or Reds\u2014that\u2019s not a noir film, but that\u2019s a big, bold film about America\u2019s character, that\u2019s a three-hour movie about American socialists with documentary footage that Warren Beatty starred in, wrote, directed, and produced. That\u2019s a big inspiration to me; it had a big effect on me. So did Do the Right Thing, which is all the same things.\n\nI wanted to still take a crack at that. I had a great ally in Toby Emmerich at Warner Bros, who wanted Warner Bros to still make those kinds of movies, like L.A. Confidential, which they made. That was my choice, to go the hard way with it. I\u2019m grateful to the people who made it alongside me; I\u2019m grateful to the cast for doing it for scale. We figured it out, for the tenth of the budget of The Irishman.\n\nFortunately, you didn\u2019t need any de-aging CGI.\n\nHe [Martin Scorsese] has earned the right to do whatever he wants. And Quentin [Tarantino] has earned the right to do it his way for those numbers. I decided to do it this way. I guess I just felt, ultimately, that there was a tradition of a certain kind of American film that I wanted to make one of, and I liked the idea of doing it at Warner Bros. I get happy when that label spins up. It\u2019s just me personally\u2014there\u2019s a romance in that. That\u2019s where Clint Eastwood made Unforgiven. I do think there\u2019s still an adult audience that still likes to go out to the movies together and see those kinds of films. And in due course, everybody else can get to it too. That\u2019s the happy thing about where we are.\n\nWhat is the biggest threat to the theatrical model, then?\n\nIf I had to say the single biggest contributor to people preferring to watch things on Netflix versus going to theaters, it\u2019s that the theaters nickel and dime on bulbs. People have no idea how many theaters do this. A lot of filmmakers and cinematographers that I know that have really started to look into this say that more than 60 percent of American theaters are running their projector at almost half the luminosity that they\u2019re required by contract to run it at. It\u2019s the theater chains that are destroying the theatrical experience. Period, full-stop. No one else.\n\nThey are delivering crappy sound and a dim picture, and no one is calling them on it. If they were delivering what they\u2019re supposed to be delivering, people would be going, \u201cWow, this is amazing, I do not get this at home.\u201d Like Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise with the motion smoothing, when they said to turn off the gaming thing, you\u2019re ruining the work we\u2019re giving to you! Well, I want people to literally walk into their theater and find the manager and say, \u201cIf this looks dark, you\u2019re giving me my money back. Because I\u2019m paying\u2014and at the ArcLight, I\u2019m paying premium\u2014for a premium experience.\u201d\n\nI went in and quality control-tested my movie in a theater that was running Captain Marvel, and you know 14 is the spec that it\u2019s supposed to be running at, and it was running at a 6.2. That means it was literally running at less than half the light that was supposed to be on there. You want to train people. Like, go get your money back. If the movie looks dark, it was\u2014go get your money back! I think we should rally around that.
