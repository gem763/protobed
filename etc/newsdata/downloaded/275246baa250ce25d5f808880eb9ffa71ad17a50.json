The director of films such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas told Empire magazine that his attempts to get up to speed with contemporary superhero films had failed.\n\n\u201cI tried, you know?\u201d the director said when asked if he had seen Marvel\u2019s movies. \u201cBut that\u2019s not cinema.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cHonestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Avengers: Endgame became the highest grossing film in history after topping $2.8m at the global box office (fifth highest after adjusting for inflation). Eight other titles from the same studio feature in the Top 30 (when factored without inflation).\n\nMarvel head Kevin Feige last year defended his films against the kind of criticism levelled by Scorsese, saying that the series\u2019s lack of major awards was no indication of a lack of quality or ambition.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s easy to dismiss VFX or flying people or spaceships or billion dollar grosses,\u201d Feige said. \u201cI think it is easy to say that you have already been awarded in a certain way. [Alfred] Hitchcock never won best director, so it\u2019s very nice, but it doesn\u2019t mean everything. I would much rather be in a room full of engaged fans.\u201d\n\nScorsese\u2019s latest film, The Irishman, won rave reviews from its premiere at the New York film festival last weekend, with critics praising the use of \u201cde-ageing\u201d technology.\n\nOut today is Joker, Todd Phillip\u2019s revisionist take on the DC villain, which borrows much from the films of Scorsese, notably 1983\u2019s The King of Comedy.", "description": "The director says he has tried and failed to watch the new brand of superhero films, which he likens to theme parks", "authors": ["Catherine Shoard"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6dbda59ec8a0da4f6d3b3a32d66d54237c927d/0_214_5358_3215/master/5358.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d85af9986738e75dd26d006ad95af6b2", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
