(AP) - Prosecutors have appealed a judge\u2019s ruling throwing out video evidence that allegedly shows New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft paying for sex at a Florida massage parlor.\n\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office filed the appeal late Tuesday, just before a deadline that would have seen the misdemeanor charge likely dropped. Prosecutors told the Florida appeals court that a county judge made several errors in throwing out the video recording.\n\nThey said the warrant allowing hidden cameras at the Orchids of Asia day spa was legal, and even if it wasn\u2019t, the judge went too far in suppressing the video.\n\nThe 78-year-old Kraft was charged in February after police said he was twice recorded paying for sex.\n\nHis lawyers\u2019 spokesman did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Prosecutors have appealed a judge\u2019s ruling throwing out video evidence that allegedly shows New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft paying for sex at a Florida massage parlor.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Terry Spencer"], "top_image": ""}
