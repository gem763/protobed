We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe will be looking at the five-game main slate starting at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nMike Clevinger - Cleveland (at Chicago White Sox)\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of quality arms on this slate, but Clevinger gets the nod in my opinion. His team is in must-win territory while holding a -270 moneyline designation against a White Sox team that ranks 19th in wRC+ with the fourth-highest strikeout rate in baseball (25.6%). Clevinger already stumped Chicago while tossing seven innings with two earned runs, two hits, and nine strikeouts on September 3. I\u2019m considering that somewhere near his baseline tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Gerrit Cole, Jack Flaherty, Noah Syndergaard\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMitch Moreland - Boston (at Texas)\n\nMoreland checks in with a non-imposing salary, and you\u2019ll need plenty of those if you decide to spend on pitching. Moreland will return to his old stomping grounds of hitter-friendly Globe Life Park to find an excellent matchup against Edison Volquez and bulk pitcher Ariel Jurado. The latter carries a vulnerable .363 wOBA split to left-handed bats, and Moreland is swinging a hot bat with four hits and three homers over his last three starts.\n\nAlso Consider: Yuli Gurriel, Carlos Santana\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nBrock Holt - Boston (at Texas)\n\nStory continues\n\nHolt makes for an intriguing bargain lift for all the same reasons outlined above with his teammate. While Holt doesn\u2019t come close to Moreland in terms of power upside, he\u2019s still a strong candidate for multiple hits and runs in a likely high-scoring game at Globe Life Park. There\u2019s not much opportunity cost at second base tonight, so I\u2019ll go ahead and lock in Holt for some much-needed value.\n\nAlso Consider: Cavan Biggio, Gavin Lux\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nTommy Edman - St. Louis (at Arizona)\n\nEdman is one of the hottest hitters on the planet right now, collecting 11 hits with two homers, two triples, and nine runs over his past six games. That includes multi-hit efforts in five of those contests. The high-contact tendencies of Arizona RHP Mike Leake should serve as fuel to Edman\u2019s fire.\n\nAlso consider: Matt Chapman, Rafael Devers\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nAmed Rosario - NY Mets (vs. Miami)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get a read on Miami RHP Sandy Alcantara, who is having a rollercoaster of a season. He looks out of sorts at the moment while allowing four earned runs in three of his past five starts. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Mets extended that tonight. Rosario is a sneaky-good candidate within that, as he\u2019s swinging a confident bat with eight hits, three homers, nine RBIs, and one stolen base over his past seven outings. The Mets\u2019 shortstop makes for a strong bargain at the position, which comes in handy if you don\u2019t have the necessary funds for Carlos Correa, Marcus Semien, or Francisco Lindor.\n\nAlso Consider: Carlos Correa, Marcus Semien\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nYasiel Puig - Cleveland (at Chicago White Sox)\n\nYou could realistically stack three Cleveland outfielders and call it good. The Indians will square off against the washed-up likes of White Sox LHP Hector Santiago and an uninspiring Chicago bullpen. Puig will enjoy the platoon advantage while swinging a hot bat with 12 hits over his past five games. Oscar Mercado and Franmil Reyes are set up perfectly in this matchup as well. Puig is my favorite, but all of them are on my shortlist through all DFS formats.\n\nRamon Laureano - Oakland (at LA Angels)\n\nWe can\u2019t forget about Oakland tonight, who has a lefty-crushing lineup facing Angels\u2019 southpaw Dillon Peters (.391 wOBA vs. RHB). Matt Chapman and Marcus Semien are great infield options, while Laureano represents the best option from the outfield. Speaking to that point, Laureano came off the disabled list several weeks ago, and it appears that he\u2019s back on track with 10 hits, seven runs, six RBIs, and one steal over his past six starts. Don\u2019t forget about Khris Davis and Mark Canha from the OAK outfield either.\n\nAlso consider: George Springer, Oscar Mercado, Franmil Reyes, Mark Canha, Michael Conforto, Khris Davis, Joc Pederson, JD Davis", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays at every position for Tuesday, September 24.
