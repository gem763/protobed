Ankara also aimed to purchase some of the jets but now says it could look elsewhere.\n\nTurkish media outlets said Graham met Erdogan in New York ahead of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nIn the video, Graham said he and Erdogan discussed a possible free trade agreement. \"Turkey is a very important ally, not just when it comes to Syria but for the whole region,\" he told reporters.\n\nErdogan is scheduled to meet Trump in New York this week.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month, Erdogan told Reuters he would discuss with Trump buying U.S. Patriot missile defenses, adding his personal bond with the U.S. leader could overcome a crisis caused by the S-400 purchase.\n\nState-owned Anadolu agency reported that Trump and Erdogan held a phone call on Sunday in which they discussed bilateral relations and regional issues.
