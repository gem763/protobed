I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn\u2019t come close,\u201d Mr Trump tweeted, in reference to the First Step Act.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise.\n\n\u201cGuys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s fury appeared to be in response to an NBC News segment on criminal justice and inmates who have been wrongfully accused. Parts of the series were broadcast last week, including one featuring Legend, who has raised awareness of criminal justice reform through his organisation FREEAMERICA.\n\nResponding on Twitter, Teigen said: \u201cLol what a p**** ass b****. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president.\u201d\n\nTeigan, who has been blocked on the social media platform by Mr Trump since 2017, continued: \u201cThe absolute best part of his tweet is I literally didn't speak in the special, nor was I mentioned. I'm cackling at the pointless addition of me because he cannot not be a b****.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
