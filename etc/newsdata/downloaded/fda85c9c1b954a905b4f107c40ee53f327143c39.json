I have to know what the concessions are.\n\n\u201cIt does look as though there is a change of mood.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMaybe there is some change on the mechanism whereby the deal is approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.\n\n\u201cMaybe there will be an opting-out mechanism rather than an opting-in mechanism.\u201d\n\nThe softer mood music after Mr Johnson\u2019s meeting with the Taoiseach followed an intensive few days which saw an acrimonious war of words explode between London, Dublin and Brussels in which the talks appeared close to collapse.\n\nBriefings by anonymous Downing Street sources had accused Mr Varadkar of backtracking on previous commitments to try to find a deal, and of refusing to negotiate.\n\nAnd following a heated telephone call between Mr Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday, Number Ten sources claimed the EU was making it \u201cessentially impossible\u201d for Britain to leave with a deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Barnier told the European Parliament there was still no basis for a fresh agreement.\n\nHe said the UK had yet to put forward an \u201coperational, legally binding solution\u201d to replace the Northern Ireland backstop \u2013 intended to prevent the return of a hard border with the Republic.\n\nWithout a deal, Mr Johnson will face demands from opposition parties to comply with the so-called Benn Act which would require him to request a three month Brexit delay if there is no agreement by October 19.\n\nThe PM has said while he will abide by the law, he is determined to leave on the Halloween deadline of October 31 come what may.\n\nGovernment sources have said ministers are preparing to hold an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament on October 19.\n\nMany MPs believe if he cannot get a deal, Mr Johnson will use the occasion to push for a \u201cpeople versus Parliament\u201d general election, possibly as early as next month.\n\nIf a deal did emerge, Mr Johnson would also need the backing of the DUP and Eurosceptic Tories to have any chance of getting it through without opposition support.\n\nLord Lamont said he thought Labour MPs were wary of an early election.\n\nHe said: \u201cBackbench Labour MPs, I understand, are really very nervous about it.\n\n\u201cI think they don\u2019t want it, and I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if we didn\u2019t slide into next year.\u201d\n\nLord Lamont said the Tories would choose to fight any election on a no deal stance if they failed to achieve an agreement with Brussels.", "description": "Talks set to indicate if discussions between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar paved way for a potential breakthrough.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/01/wire-19564706-1570752222-404_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
