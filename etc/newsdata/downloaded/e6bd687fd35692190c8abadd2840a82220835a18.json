Kosgei won in Chicago last year in 2:18:35.\n\n\"I'm feeling good and I am happy because I was not expected to run like this,\" Kosgei said.\n\nKosgei's run came little more than 24 hours after fellow Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge became the first man to run 26.2 miles in less than two hours, clocking 1:59:41 in Vienna. Unlike Kipchoge's performance, however, Kosgei's mark was set in an official race on a record-eligible course.\n\nThe moment history was made by Brigid Kosgei. 2:14:04. <a href=\"https://t.co/afABYGC9td\">pic.twitter.com/afABYGC9td</a> \u2014@WMMajors\n\nRadcliffe first set a world record at Chicago in 2002 before besting her own mark a year later in London.\n\n\"It was 17 years ago exactly today that I set the first world record here in Chicago,\" said Radcliffe, who attended Sunday's race. \"That was a special day for me today and it's a very special day for Brigid today.\"\n\nKosgei, who also won this year's London Marathon in 2:18:20, set a fast early pace but slowed a bit after the halfway mark. She was waving to the crowd as she approached the finish line, nearly seven minutes ahead of runners following her.\n\nBrigid Kosgei has shown otherworldly the past few years <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChicagoMarathon?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ChicagoMarathon</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/k2ghCLbjdD\">pic.twitter.com/k2ghCLbjdD</a> \u2014@hornekerjustin\n\nAbabel Yeshaneh and Gelete Burka, both of Ethiopia, finished second and third. Yeshaneh's time was 2:20:51 and Burka's was 2:20:55\n\nLawrence Cherono sprinted across the finish in the men's race to beat Dejene Debela by one second. The Kenyan Cherono finished in 2:05:45, with Ethiopia's Debela two strides behind. Asefa Mengstu, also of Kenya, came in third three seconds behind Cherono.\n\n\"All of a sudden when we reach 41 kilometre, the [other runners] were not going again,\" Cherono said. \"I decided to kick and felt I was still having enough energy to sprint. I tried my luck and it worked.\"\n\nCherono won the Boston Marathon in April in 2:07:57. Sunday's win marked his eighth career marathon victory.\n\nDefending champion Mo Farah, who set a European record here last year, finished in ninth in 2:09:58.", "description": "Brigid Kosgei of Kenya won the Chicago Marathon on Sunday in 2 hours 14 minutes 4 seconds to break Paula Radcliffe's world record in the event, set in 2003.
