The exuberant palette and atmospheric depth of his Blue Over Red reflects the mastery of this transformative period in Rothko\u2019s career,\u201d Galperin said.\n\nBlue Over Red was offered for sale from an anonymous European collector, who has held the painting since 2007, according to Sotheby\u2019s. Other previous prominent owners include famed New York dealer and collector Harold Diamond, who specialized in 20th-century works, and Baltimore collectors Israel and Selma Rosen, who sold the work at an auction in 2005 for $5.6 million.\n\nRothko\u2019s color-block paintings have been highly sought after. His auction record was set by the 1961 Orange, Red, Yellow, which realized $86.9 million at Christie\u2019s New York in May 2012.\n\nHis 1960 Untitled, which features a subdued color palette of deep burgundy, warm blush, royal blue, black grey, and ephemeral cloud-white, sold for $50.1 million at Sotheby\u2019s this spring on behalf of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nTo date, seven Rothko paintings have sold above $50 million, and 28 works have sold above $20 million, according to the Artnet\u2019s price database.", "description": "The masterpiece will headline Sotheby\u2019s Nov. 14 contemporary art sale", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-119867/social", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
