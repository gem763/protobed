Agents Then Investigated The Rapper.", "language": "en", "text": "Documents obtained by BuzzFeed News show the Secret Service interviewed the rapper about his Trump lyrics after an email from a TMZ staffer.\n\nChristopher Polk / Getty Images\n\nIn August 2018, Eminem announced the surprise release of his new album, Kamikaze, in a tweet, delighting his fans with 13 fiery new raps, just eight months after he dropped his last album, Revival. Kamikaze\u2019s lead track, \u201cThe Ringer,\u201d immediately attracted attention on social media due to lyrics in which Eminem, a fierce critic of President Donald Trump, claimed he was visited by the Secret Service: \"\u2018Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service / To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin\u2019 him / Or ask if I\u2019m linked to terrorists / I said, \u2018Only when it comes to ink and lyricists.'\" At the time, the Secret Service refused to say whether agents had indeed visited Eminem, citing their policy of not commenting on or confirming \u201cthe absence or existence of specific investigations.\u201d So last year BuzzFeed News filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Secret Service to find out if agents really were sent to speak with Eminem. This week, the agency turned over 40 pages of documents that prove they did in fact interview the rapper. It turns out their interest in speaking with him was based on \u201cthreatening lyrics\u201d from his rap \u201cFramed\u201d that appeared on Revival. The Secret Service characterized Eminem as \u201cexhibiting inappropriate behavior\u201d and noted that he, via the rap, \u201cthreatens protectee.\u201d\n\nSecret Service/BuzzFeed News\n\nAccording to the documents, on Dec. 15, 2017, the day Revival was released, \u201ca concerned citizen reported Marshall Mathers the rapper \u2018Eminem\u2019 had a new song called \u2018Framed\u2019 with an inappropriate comment towards President Donald Trump and a threatening comment towards Ivanka Trump.\u201d The \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d was a TMZ employee, according to the documents. They sent the Secret Service an email with a link to an article in the Hill about the song. \u201cI want to know if your agency is investigating Eminem for his threatening lyrics about First daughter Ivanka Trump,\u201d the person wrote. It appears the TMZ employee was seeking comment from the Secret Service. The documents do not reveal the agency received correspondence from any other individual about the song. Hours before the email was sent, TMZ had published a story about Eminem\u2019s lyrics criticizing Trump. TMZ did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The Secret Service investigative documents, which are heavily redacted, go on to say, \u201cthe song was about a murder that he could remember and must be \u2018framed\u2019 with the specific lyrics, \u2018Donald Duck\u2019s on as the Tonka Truck in the yard. But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car? ... ' cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde Girl, that motherfuckin ' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond, Second murder with no recollection of it...\u201d The documents also note, \u201cThis is not the first time MATHERS made threatening comments towards POTUS and his family. In June 2017, MATHERS freestyled comments that were threatening in nature towards POTUS.\u201d\n\nWin Mcnamee / Getty Images\n\nIncluded as background evidence to support Eminem's hatred of Trump was a Dec. 18, 2017, interview Vulture conducted with the rapper in which he said Trump \"makes my blood boil.\" The Secret Service documents show the agency\u2019s Protective Intelligence and Assessment Division conducted a background check on Eminem and started to arrange an interview with the rapper through his attorneys on Dec. 20, 2017. The interview took place a month later, on the afternoon of Jan. 16, 2018, with Eminem and his legal team. Two pages of documents summarizing the discussion were entirely redacted but shows that it centered around Eminem\u2019s BET freestyle rap and the lyrics in \u201cFramed\u201d and \"Like Home,\" another track off of Revival that features Alicia Keys. During the interview with Secret Service, when agents began to read the lyrics of his freestyle rap, \u201cMathers was familiar the song and began rap along with the interviewers as the verse was read,\" according to the documents.\n\nThe agents questioned Eminem about \"fan mail that may include threats, or unusual interest items due to his songs.\" \u201cAt the conclusion of the interview, Agents again offered to answer any questions. It was also explained that any additional questions about this investigation should be directed to the USSS [United States Secret Service] Office of Government and Public Affairs. Counsel then escorted Agents from Mather's office,\u201d the documents say. The interview was discussed two days later at a Secret Service meeting, the documents say, \u201cand it was determined that this case will be NON-REFERRED\u201d to a federal prosecutor. Elsewhere in the documents, which refer to the rapper throughout by his real name, Marshall Mathers, there is a section that lists his aliases: Eminem and Slim Shady.", "description": "Documents obtained by BuzzFeed News show the Secret Service interviewed the rapper about his Trump lyrics after an email from a TMZ staffer.", "authors": ["Jason Leopold", "Buzzfeed News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-10/24/20/campaign_images/cd5bd15f4b72/tmz-emailed-the-secret-service-about-eminems-trum-2-237-1571950236-0_dblbig.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
