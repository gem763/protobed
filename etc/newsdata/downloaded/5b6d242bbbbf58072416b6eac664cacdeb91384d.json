The question is: with Fiz Stape (Jennie McApline) temporarily out of the way, is Jade out to seduce Tyrone (Alan Halshall)?\n\nFiz is horrified when \u2014 after receiving a call \u2014 she learns that her mum\u2019s had an accident. With her only having been back on the cobbles a short while, she\u2019s worried about the prospect of having to up sticks and leave once more \u2014 especially when Hope desperately needs her.\n\nHowever \u2014 never missing an opportunity to take advantage \u2014 Jade insists that Fiz should go and tend to her mum, and that she\u2019ll be more than happy to care for the kids in her absence.\n\nHowever, Fiz still isn\u2019t convinced, and she opens up to Jade about how she suspects that Hope was responsible for the recent factory fire \u2014 something that, if true, would prove that the young girl is back up to her old tricks again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s takes some work, but Jade successfully manages to persuade Fiz that it\u2019s her duty to go and look after her mum, before commenting that Hope will be in safe hands with both her and Tyrone.\n\nWith Fiz out of the picture, Jade sets about cooking a meal for both Tyrone and Evelyn (Maureen Lipman) and \u2014 afterwards \u2014 she hands Tyrone a present. It\u2019s a dartboard, and he\u2019s chuffed as a result.\n\nIs Jade planning on getting her claws into Tyrone?\n\nIt would certainly seem that way.\n\nOne to watch: Wednesday 30th October at 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Is Jade playing a dangerous game?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/30_10_coro_fiz_jade_hope_1st_ep_02-6268_1571053843.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
