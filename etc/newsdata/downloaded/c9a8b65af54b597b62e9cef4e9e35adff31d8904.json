Fans gathered on courts amid Hong Kong's high-rise buildings Tuesday to vent their anger.\n\nThe player for the Los Angeles Lakers touched a nerve among protesters for suggesting that free speech can have negative consequences. They have been protesting for months in defense of the same freedom that James said can carry \"a lot of negative.\"\n\nThe protesters chanted support for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, something of a hero among demonstrators in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory for having tweeted in support of their struggle, infuriating authorities in China.\n\nWhat the crowd of approximately 200 people chanted about James wasn't printable.\n\n\"People are angry,\" said James Lo, a web designer who runs a Hong Kong basketball fan page on Facebook. He said he's already received a video from a protester that showed him burning a No. 23 jersey bearing James' name.\n\nHe expects more, given the backlash from protesters who've been regularly hitting the streets of Hong Kong and battling police because of concerns that the international business hub is slowly losing its freedoms, which are unique in China.\n\n\"Students, they come out like every weekend. They've got tear gassed and then they got gun-shot, like every weekend. Police beating students and then innocent people, like every day. And then he (James) just comes up with something (like) that. We just can't accept that.\"\n\nJames made his comments in response to a question about whether Morey should be punished for his tweet that reverberated in China and had consequences for the NBA.\n\n\"Yes, we do have freedom of speech,\" James said. \"But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, when you only think about yourself.\"\n\nHe added: \"So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.\"\n\nProtesters said James' comments smacked of a double-standard, because he's used his clout as a sports headliner to press for social causes in the United States.\n\n\"Please remember, all NBA players, what you said before: 'Black lives matter.' Hong Kong lives also matter!\" one of the protesters, 36-year-old office worker William Mok, said in addressing the applauding crowd.\n\nOthers said LeBron's comments made it seem that he's more worried about money than people.\n\n\"James was trying, you know, to take a side, on the China side, which is like ridiculous,\" said Aaron Lee, a 36-year-old marketing director. \"He was being honest, financially. Financial is money. Simple as that. LeBron James stands for money. Period.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
