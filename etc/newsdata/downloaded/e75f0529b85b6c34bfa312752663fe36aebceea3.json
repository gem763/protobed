Safety advocates hope the technology will become as standard as air bags. Limited road testing has been underway in Maryland and Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nThe Reduce Impaired Driving for Everyone Act, or RIDE Act, co-sponsored by Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) would provide additional funding for continued research and road-testing of passive detection systems and set a timeline of about four years to put the technology on the market. It would also commit $25 million for the federal government to test such devices in its massive fleet of vehicles as early as fiscal 2021. Similar legislation has been introduced by Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) in the House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the time for research is over,\u201d Helen Witty, MADD\u2019s president, said Wednesday during a news conference that was streamed on Facebook and attended by the relatives of an entire Michigan family that was killed in an alcohol-related crash in Kentucky earlier this year.\n\nAD\n\nThe Auto Alliance, an industry organization, welcomed additional efforts by the government to reduce drunken driving but also expressed uneasiness about a mandated time frame to require the use of technology that hasn\u2019t yet been perfected.\n\nAD\n\nNearly 11,000 people were killed as a result of drunken driving in 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says. On average, that works out to a death about every 48 minutes.\n\nAmong the victims are people such as the Abbas family, who were killed when a suspected drunk driver headed the wrong way on Interstate 75 and struck the family\u2019s vehicle on Jan. 6. The crash killed Issam Abbas, 42; his wife, Rima, 38, and their children: Ali, 13; Isabella, 12 and Giselle, 7. The suspected drunk driver also died.\n\nAD\n\nWilliam Mirza offered a moving tribute to his uncle, who he said had been a role model. Mirza also urged immediate action to end drunken driving.\n\n\u201cDrunken driving is an atrocious cancer that has plagued our nation for far too long,\u201d Mirza said. \u201cIt is time that we take a hard look at ourselves and ask if we have been doing everything to protect and serve the citizens of this country. Because the fact of the matter is, if we had, my family \u2014 and countless other families would still be here right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNHTSA has spent $50 million in the effort to develop technology that would reliably and quickly determine whether a driver is impaired. These efforts include a government-funded research program involving more than a dozen automakers to develop the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety (DADSS). Some advocates have accused the auto industry and federal transportation officials of moving too slowly to implement DADSS or something like it in the marketplace.\n\nAD\n\nJoan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator and president emeritus of Public Citizen, said action by the federal government would spur the industry to move faster to make the technology available.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most exciting issues I\u2019ve ever seen for alcohol issues, [and] I\u2019ve been working on them since 1966,\u201d she said. Yet, she said, the automakers have been \u201cslow-walking\u201d the introduction of potentially lifesaving technology, especially compared with billions spent on developing autonomous vehicles.\n\nAD\n\nSome automakers have taken steps toward developing and using technology that could be used to combat drunken driving. In 2015, Jaguar announced a project known as \u201cSixth Sense\u201d that would monitor the driver\u2019s heartbeat, among other things, to determine whether the person was fatigued or distracted. In March, Volvo said it would install in-car cameras and sensors to monitor whether a driver was impaired.\n\nAD\n\nThe Auto Alliance said legislation could help move the process along, but not without funding.\n\n\u201cWhile efforts to help spur that commercial scale deployment are appreciated, they cannot be realized without continued congressional funding of the public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Transportation and automakers, currently scheduled to expire in September of 2020,\u201d Auto Alliance spokesman Wade Newton said in an email. \u201cSustaining this program, which is currently testing and validating the DADSS technology, is vital to completing the work necessary to achieve commercialization.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "A bipartisan measure, backed by MADD, would require auto makers to install alcohol-detecting technology in all new cars that would prevent impaired drivers from operating them. Such technology has been under development for at least 10 years and safety advocates say the time has come to put it to use.", "authors": ["Fredrick Kunkle", "General Assignment Reporting"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/h2Tksi9V9Ih-9TwjWvZvz4iwNrw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/42LUBB46B5G6PEN4PJJS3AH4UE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
