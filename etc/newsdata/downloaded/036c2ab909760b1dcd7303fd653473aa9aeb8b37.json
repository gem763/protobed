REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nThe crowd waved Chinese flags in the arena before the game started, but the packed stands gave the players a huge welcome on court and shouted enthusiastically throughout the game.\n\nThe Nets won 114-111.\n\nThe tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting sometimes violent anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong sparked a furore in China\uff0cwith a fan event cancelled and Chinese partners cutting ties with the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nThe exhibition game was most notable for a facial injury to Nets guard Kyrie Irving a minute in. Irving, one of the headliners in the NBA\u2019s promotion, was taken off immediately and did not return.\n\n\u201cMost people are very rational today,\u201d one spectator said. \u201cWe all love basketball. But if NBA players or officials continue to make some of these wrong comments, we have no choice\u201d but to protest.\n\nRoads near the stadium were blocked off ahead of the game and those attending had to go through two rounds of security checks.\n\nStreet vendors were selling Chinese national flags outside the arena and some people had called online on those going to the game to carry flags in a show of force.\n\nSome people protested before the game outside the stadium against Morey and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who has spoken out in support of the tweet.\n\n\u201cThere are no Lakers or Nets fans tonight. We are all Chinese basketball fans,\u201d one protester said.\n\nNO SHOW\n\nNBA events scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday were cancelled and Chinese sponsors and partners have suspended or severed ties with the league. Sponsors\u2019 logos were noticeable by their absence on the court.\n\nRelated Coverage Lakers game in China sidesteps Hong Kong in NBA preseason marked by tension\n\nState broadcaster CCTV and Tencent did not show Thursday\u2019s game and will not show the rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy, with activists throwing petrol bombs, setting street fires and trashing metro stations.\n\nChina has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media has characterised Morey\u2019s tweet as the latest example of meddling in China\u2019s own affairs.\n\nThe former British colony of Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula guaranteeing it wide-ranging autonomy.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s business in China, which took years to cultivate and is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion, is under immense pressure.\n\nThe NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Saturday\u2019s Lakers-Nets game would take place.\n\nROCKETS GOODS DISAPPEAR\n\nHouston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise have been pulled from several Nike and NBA stores in major Chinese cities, with the franchise\u2019s direct association with Morey making it a central target of the furore. Managers at some of the Nike stores said they had been instructed to remove the goods via an internal memo from management.\n\nA specialist NBA store at a major shopping centre in Shanghai removed all Rockets merchandise, as did the basketball-themed NBA Playzone family entertainment centres in Beijing and Shanghai.\n\n\u201cRockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,\u201d the colours of the Golden State Warriors, said a manager at the Shanghai Playzone, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nNike and the NBA did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.\n\nOther major Chinese retailers, including Alibaba and JD.com, also pulled Rockets merchandise off their various platforms. Alibaba and JD.com declined to comment.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nChinese state and party-backed media continued to publish items critical of the NBA. The official English China Daily published an editorial cartoon on Thursday playing on the NBA\u2019s official logo of an athlete dribbling a basketball. The cartoon instead put a bomb labelled \u201cpolitics\u201d in the athlete\u2019s hand, leaving the basketball fallen by the wayside.\n\nU.S. sports broadcaster ESPN was also criticised for its coverage of the row after using a map that appeared to endorse Beijing\u2019s claims to both self-ruled Taiwan and disputed territories in the South China Sea.", "description": "Thousands of Chinese fans cheered and clapped through an NBA exhibition game in Shanghai on Thursday after days of controversy and online vitriol over a now-deleted tweet by a team manager backing anti-China protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Winni Zhou", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439224422&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990U3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
