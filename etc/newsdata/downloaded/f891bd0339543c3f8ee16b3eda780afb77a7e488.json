PlayStation 2 \u2013 155.0 million\n\n2. Nintendo DS \u2013 154.02 million\n\n3. Game Boy \u2013 118.69 million\n\n4. PlayStation 4 \u2013 102.8 million\n\n5. PlayStation \u2013 102.49 million\n\n6. Wii \u2013 101.63 million\n\n7. PlayStation 3 \u2013 87.4 million\n\n8. Xbox 360 \u2013 84 million\n\n9. Game Boy Advance \u2013 81.51 million\n\n10. PlayStation Portable \u2013 approx. 80 million\n\nAs you can see from the chart above though, when you factor in portable consoles the PlayStation 4 is actually only the fourth best-selling console of all-time. Although of course it does have a year left as Sony\u2019s primary console, so that won\u2019t be its final total.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMicrosoft has refused to release sales numbers for the Xbox One but they\u2019re thought to stand at around 45 million. Despite launching over three years later, the Nintendo Switch is expected to pass the Xbox One this year, as the Switch was on 36.87 million as of June.\n\nGiven the release of the PlayStation 5 next Christmas it\u2019s unlikely that the PlayStation 4 will nab the top spot, but there\u2019s a good chance it could pass the Game Boy and take third place. Especially as the PlayStation 4 has already been named the fastest-selling console of all-time.\n\nIt\u2019s already a huge achievement for Sony though who, in part thanks to early failures by Microsoft and Nintendo, have made victory look easy this generation.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Sony has already trademarked PlayStation 6, and PS7, PS8, PS9, and PS10\n\nMORE: PlayStation makes major next gen blunder as European staff face redundancies\n\nMORE: PlayStation VR 2 wireless headset revealed in new Sony patent", "description": "Sony\u2019s current gen console has passed the lifetime totals of the Wii and PS1 and is now second only to the PlayStation 2.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PS4-Pro-34be_1572454019.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
