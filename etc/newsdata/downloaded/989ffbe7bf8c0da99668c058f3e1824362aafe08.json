Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp fell about 1% in premarket trading, while Ambarella Inc slumped 10%.\n\nDow heavyweight Boeing Co fell 1.5% after the Wall Street Journal reported friction between the United States and Europe could further delay efforts to resume flights of the planemaker's best-selling 737 MAX jets, which have been grounded since early 2019.\n\nThe three main indexes logged their first fall in three sessions on Monday as investors tackled mixed headlines on U.S.-China trade.

S&P 500 e-minis were down 20 points, or 0.68%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 55.25 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index is now about 3% off its record high hit in July.\n\nMarket participants will now turn their attention to the third-quarter earnings season beginning next week for evidence of the impact of the trade war on corporate America.\n\nAnalysts expect the worst quarterly profit performance since 2016, with earnings from S&P 500 companies declining nearly 3% from a year earlier, based on IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nAmong other stocks, Nektar Therapeutics slid 7.1% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the drug developer's stock to \"sell.\"\n\nU.S.-listed Chinese stocks also declined, with Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com Inc and Baidu Inc down between 1.6% and 3%.\n\nOn the data front, the Labor Department will release its report on producer price index (PPI), at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is expected to have remained at 0.1% last month.
