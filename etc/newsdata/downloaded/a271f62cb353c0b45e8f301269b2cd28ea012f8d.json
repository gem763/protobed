At this point the the offensive material has the potential to reach millions of users.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Facebook has come under scrutiny for endangering its younger users.\n\nA separate Facebook messenger app that the company said would protect kids - some as young as six-years-old - was found to be letting its young users talk to strangers.", "description": "The ads were served via Facebook's targeted marketing algorithm which aggregates users likes and interests to help key-in on products and services that a user might want to buy, but doesn't factor in age.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19259984-0-image-a-3_1570661843771.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
