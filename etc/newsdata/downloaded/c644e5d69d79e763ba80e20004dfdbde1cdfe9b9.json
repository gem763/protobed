They zoom in and zoom out at the wrong time. I\u2019d actually like to see the footwork thanks\"\n\n\"Is it just me or was the camera work a bit off on Strictly tonight? Feel like we didn\u2019t get the full impact of Oti and Kelvin at all,\" another tweeted.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nA third piped in: \"Mind you, there was some dreadful camera work that missed key parts of the dance #Strictly \"\n\nViewers mostly hated the fact that they couldn't see their favourite couples feet during their dance routines, and have pleaded with the cameramen to sort it out.\n\n\"I\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ll say it again. @bbcstrictly For the love of cake, please sort the camera work!\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nSign up for our Strictly updates Love Strictly?

It\u2019s a bloody dancing show! #Strictly\"\n\nIt seems others thought the \"dodgy\" shots were missing \"key moves\" throughout the show.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIt comes after Tess Daly burst into a fit of laughter after judge Craig Revel Horwood mocked Anton's \"fake teeth\".\n\nThe presenter couldn't hold back her giggling after the ordeal, and continued to do so as Craig was giving feedback to Anton.\n\nTess then admitted it was \"slightly embarrassing\" as Craig apologised for mocking Anton.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBut the professional dancer seemed to laugh it off as he turned to face the audience and mouthed something about Craig.\n\nJudge Motsi added: \"Now we know - the teeth are real guys, that has been cleared!\" and she turned to speak to Emma about their routine, with Tess still in heaps of laughter.\n\nIt seems it will be a moment that will go down in the show's history.", "description": "Fans of the hit show have hit out at cameramen for the \"dodgy\" angles", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Pa", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20385194.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EMB-18928754-high_res-strictly-come-dancing-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
