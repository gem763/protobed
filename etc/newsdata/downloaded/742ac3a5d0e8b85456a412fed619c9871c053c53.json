Tehran has denied having a role in any of them.\n\nSaudi Arabia had no immediate comment on Friday's reported attack on the Iranian-owned tanker. The U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, which operates in the region, said it was aware of the reports but had no further information.\n\nPolitical risk consultancy Eurasia Group said it did not have firm evidence about who may have been behind the incident.\n\n\"The proximity of the tanker at the time of the attack to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Jeddah port might imply that the missiles could possibly have been launched from the kingdom.\n\n\"Another plausible theory is that it was an Israeli sabotage operation...The purpose would be to disrupt Iranian tanker activity in the Red Sea corridor as it heads towards the Suez Canal. A third possibility would be that the attack was conducted by a terrorist group,\" Eurasia said in a statement.\n\nThe reports offered sometimes diverging accounts. Iranian state-run television, citing the national oil company, said the tanker was hit by missiles while denying a report they came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry said the ship was hit twice, without saying what struck it. State television broadcast images from the Sabiti's deck saying they were taken after the attack but showing no visible damage. The ship's hull was not in view.\n\nThe Red Sea is a major global shipping route for oil and other trade, linking the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. Crude prices jumped briefly on the news of the alleged attack and industry sources said it could drive up already high shipping costs.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for the reported incident, which follows attacks on tankers in the Gulf in May and June, as well as strikes on Saudi oil sites in September.\n\n(Reporting by Dubai newsroom Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "Leakage of cargo from an Iranian-owned oil tanker apparently hit by missiles in Red Sea waters off Saudi Arabia has been stopped as it heads for the Gulf, the semi-official Iranian news agency Mehr reported on Saturday.
