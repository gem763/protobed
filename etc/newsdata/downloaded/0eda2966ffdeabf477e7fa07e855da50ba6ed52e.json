Interest rates on loans and deposits are typically influenced by the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions vis-\u00e0-vis the federal funds rate.\n\n\u201cBanks have to lower the deposit rates now in response to the Fed rate cut,\u201d said Dan Geller, founder of consulting firm Analyticom. Here\u2019s what not to do now that the Fed has cut rates:\n\nDon\u2019t ignore certificates of deposit\n\nRates on certificates of deposit have been falling for months now \u2014 the first time that has happened across the board in five years.\n\nAs a result, people will earn less substantial returns when they take out a CD these days than they would have at the start of 2019. But that doesn\u2019t mean they should shift away from this savings tool.\n\nIn fact, CDs may be a better bet, Geller said. \u201cIf you can get a good high-yield now and you\u2019re guaranteed to receive this rate for the next three to five years, you\u2019re going to ride the next recession with a relatively high rate,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more: Trump blasts Jerome Powell after Fed rate cut: \u2018No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision!\u2019\n\nMany people make the mistake of moving their cash into liquid accounts, such as high-yield money-market and savings accounts, particularly as the threat of a recession looms, Geller said.\n\nThe yield on those accounts isn\u2019t guaranteed like it is with a CD. He estimates that Americans lost billions of dollars in interest by giving into this money anxiety during the last recession.\n\n\u201cResist the temptation to think that if you put it in a money-market account that it\u2019s more accessible to you in a time of need,\u201d Geller said. \u201cEven if you have to pay a small penalty at some point to break the CD, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nGeller\u2019s simple rule of thumb for approaching CDs today: Find the highest rate for the longest term.\n\nDon\u2019t just leave your money in a bank account and forget about it\n\nA recent survey from Bankrate found that nearly 70% of Americans had savings accounts that paid less than 2% interest. At a time when interest rates are falling, that can be an especially costly mistake.\n\n\u201cDo not let your money sit fallow in a bank paying an uncompetitive return,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. He added, \u201cBe prepared to move their money to a bank paying a better return.\u201d\n\nAlso see: Millennials share their retirement plans on Twitter \u2014 let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not good\n\nMany online banks offer upwards of 2% interest on their savings accounts \u2014 even in the current climate. Those banks will continue to compete on interest despite rates falling overall in order to score more customers.\n\nDon\u2019t make major adjustments to your long-term savings plan\n\nThe Fed\u2019s interest-rate decision initially sent stocks falling \u2014 both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.19% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.00% both dropped in afternoon trading before recovering \u2014 largely because the central bank did not clarify whether it will cut rates yet again later this year.\n\nMarkets have been volatile in recent months, thanks to monetary policy, an increasingly volatile stock market and President Trump\u2019s ongoing trade dispute with China.\n\nAs such, this isn\u2019t the time to pull money out of the market or make significant changes to your retirement planning. Instead, experts suggest seeking out healthy distractions like hanging out with friends or hitting up the gym.", "description": "Already, the Fed\u2019s rate cut has affected banks\u2019 decision-making.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR605_Couple_ZG_20190919090021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
