A court in Rennes said he'd had no right to take the law into his own hands in May and ban all pesticides within a 150-meter cordon of his village.\n\nDejected by the ruling, Cueff told POLITICO in an interview in his modest town hall office that he was simply outgunned by powerful farmers\u2019 unions and giant chemical interests, and that the health of his 600 villagers is now \u201cscrewed.\u201d\n\nBut his courtroom defeat, which he says he will appeal, is hardly a clear-cut signal that France will forever support the interests of farmers. In a telltale sign of the way the political winds are blowing, Cueff\u2019s act of resistance, reminiscent of the defiant little Gaulish village that holds out against Roman rule in the Asterix books, has become a national cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.\n\nPoliticians are treading very carefully. They know that Cueff commands deep public support for his campaign against glyphosate, a ubiquitous herbicide that has become one of the most explosive health issues across the EU amid continued debate over whether it causes cancer (industry points to assessments that say it likely does not, critics question how those assessments were conducted). But lawmakers also fear losing support from farmers who say they depend on pesticides and lack viable alternatives to preserve their crops.\n\nThe issue has even reached the Elys\u00e9e Palace, and President Emmanuel Macron praised Cueff\u2019s \u201cintentions\u201d for tackling glyphosate. In an interview with the media outlet Konbini on Saturday, Macron argued that \"the solution is not to issue a decree that doesn't comply with the law\" but rather \"to mobilize to change the law.\"\n\nTo the mayor, that represents a double standard.\n\n\"There's a sort of paradox,\" explained Cueff, his phone constantly ringing thanks to his new-found celebrity status among journalists. \"We have a government that\u2019s saying, on the one hand, the mayor is right, that we need to protect the population ... and at the same time dragging me before the courts.\"\n\nBorne's ultimatum\n\nIn addition to Macron, Ecology Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne has also rallied to Cueff's banner. She said she \u201ctotally shared\u201d his worries and announced the government would make new laws to keep pesticides at a safe distance from houses.\n\nCueff was unimpressed, however, by the politician's promises. \u201cWe are in France so the words sometimes sound beautiful. Now I\u2019m keen to see what will come out of it in reality. The government is doing nothing and they have just banned a mayor from doing something,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is strong evidence of politicians' words not amounting to much. Macron had to walk back from his original pledge of completely phasing out glyphosate by 2021 because of the harm that would be done to the country's all-important farm industry. The country now says it will eliminate most uses of the herbicide by 2021 and ban it completely in 2022, when its current EU license expires.\n\n\u201cGlyphosate, it\u2019s not vitamins. We don\u2019t want any of it,\" Cueff complained. \"But we have it anyway. If you smoke it\u2019s your decision but you don\u2019t have the right to poison people.\u201d\n\nIn May, some of the locals had samples of their urine tested by a lab in Germany, an event the village jokingly called \"the grand piss-off.\" Cueff says the results showed an unhealthily high level of glyphosate, including in a child who eats at an organic school canteen.\n\nFor two decades, the mayor has been molding Langou\u00ebt into what is probably France's most eco-friendly commune. Pesticides are already banned from public-owned green spaces, there are rows of energy-efficient wooden houses, a community apple orchard, solar panels everywhere and the organic school canteen.\n\nThe mayor is highly frustrated that the court in Rennes did not give his experimental embargo more time. Condemning the \"legalification\" of the issue, he said that he had been making baby steps with local farmers toward a greener model.\n\n\u201cWe could have been an example [to the whole of France],\" he said. \"My satchel is full of solutions, which have been brought to me by farmers \u2026 I would have helped them [to make the transition] and now I can\u2019t. If they don\u2019t want to, I can\u2019t help them.\u201d\n\nGiven the quick crackdown by the court in Rennes, he said that the next step could be that French citizens would follow the course taken in the U.S. and file individual suits. In the case of the U.S., thousands of people are coming forward to sue Bayer, which produces the glyhophate-based weedkiller Roundup, arguing that the herbicide caused them to develop cancer \u2014 something the company strenuously denies, citing assessments from regulators and scientists.\n\nIn France, Cueff suggested people could focus their anger elsewhere.\n\n\"People will perhaps take legal action directly against the farmers,\u201d Cueff said.\n\nAna\u00eblle Berthelot, a graphic designer, who lives with her two small children in an eco-house just meters from a maize field, which uses pesticides, came to the village precisely because of its eco-friendly reputation.\n\n\u201cI find it unbelievable that we, in our houses, are polluted by people working. We\u2019re at home, in our garden, we paid for this land. If the pesticides stopped at the edge of our garden, then everyone could do what they want. But it\u2019s not like that,\" she said, cradling her six-week-old son in her arms.\n\nFarmers' fury\n\nBut not all of the commune's inhabitants support the mayor.\n\nOne of the five farmers in Langou\u00ebt, two of who are organic, is Dominique Hamon. He owns dairy cows and uses pesticides to grow the maize to feed them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s cut my leg off,\" he said as he fixed an electric fence around one of his fields. \"[The mayor] has said \u2018we\u2019re going to help you keep going.\u2019 But you know, when you amputate somebody's limb, when you give them a prosthetic, it is rarely the right length \u2026 I guarantee you will never walk as well again.\"\n\nDespite Cueff insisting he is ready to talk to farmers about new solutions, Hamon said: \u201cBefore going so far, they should have had a big roundtable with the farmers and tried to discuss and find alternatives. He didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe FDSEA farm union also warned that it had to keep its attention squarely focused on the broader anti-pesticide trend, and referred to Borne's plan of a ban on pesticides near homes. \"We have to keep up our explanatory work to stop unsuitable decisions from being taken.\"", "description": "Daniel Cueff lost a battle against glyphosate, but not necessarily the war.", "authors": ["Eddy Wax", "Eline Schaart", "Judith Mischke"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1163161811-1200x628.jpg"}
