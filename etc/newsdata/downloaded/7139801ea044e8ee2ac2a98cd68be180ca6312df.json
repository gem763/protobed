Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts of cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

This would set our country back years. You would have to question if PM Johnson is genuinely serious about getting a deal, this suggests not.\n\n\u201cWe need to see something that is credible and if this is what is being proposed it certainly won\u2019t be acceptable not only to the Irish government but to the EU as a whole.\u201d\n\nMcEntee also suggested the proposals, which will be presented as a fair and generous offer, reneged on previous commitments by the UK to ensure no hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cIt is still talking about the need and requirement for customs checks. So, again, to go back to the commitments it is no infrastructure or associated checks, protecting the Good Friday agreement and the areas of cooperation, protecting the all-Ireland economy and protecting the single market and our place in it. And if that is what is being proposed it certainly doesn\u2019t do any of that,\u201d she said.\n\nThe former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain said the Brexit plan could break the law and \u201csabotage\u201d the Good Friday agreement.\n\nThe Labour peer said by insisting on extra customs checks and different trading relationships across the Irish border the government \u201cis proposing to break the law\u201d.\n\nHe said it would breach Britain\u2019s own Withdrawal Act 2018, which includes a detailed clause specifically banning \u201cborder arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after exit day that feature physical infrastructure, including border posts, or checks and controls, that did not exist before exit day\u201d.\n\nHain added: \u201cThis will also sabotage the Good Friday peace agreement.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s Brexit Act passed by the government includes a ban on the very customs checks proposed by Johnson, says Lord Hain Photograph: screengrab/Withdrawal Act 2019 on Irish border infrastructure\n\nIt is understood that Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s strategist, has warned top advisers that the UK is prepared to walk away if the EU does not engage seriously with the offer.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, we won\u2019t be hanging around waiting for them to negotiate with us,\u201d he told a meeting of senior advisers. \u201cIf they reject our offer, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nEU sources said the outlines of the proposal did not meet the objectives of the Irish backstop, and threatened both the integrity of the single market and peace in Northern Ireland. \u201cIf this is the final offer, then there is not a deal to be had,\u201d said one EU official.\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nA senior EU diplomat said the two negotiating sides were in fundamental disagreement, and that there was insufficient time to bridge the gap with just three weeks to go before the UK is due to leave the bloc.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is a difference in the starting point. We want to avoid the border and checks and controls. And the other side are saying, \u2018No we will need some kind of controls, one way or another\u2019, which is difficult for us to accept as it runs into the clear goal of the stability of the island of Ireland.\u201d\n\nPhilippe Lamberts, a member of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said there was no confidence that Johnson could even guarantee the Commons\u2019 support for his proposals.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are in a worse situation than we were facing Theresa May because at least Theresa May had a working majority \u2026 The last thing the EU wants to do is to make concessions that won\u2019t fly in Westminster.\n\n\u201cMy interpretation of Boris Johnson\u2019s actions since being prime minister is to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union without a deal but with the opportunity to shift the blame to someone else.\u201d", "description": "Prime minister\u2019s \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 proposals described as unworkable and illegal", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67521a361429523b24373307c291ef299be0394b/0_82_8131_4879/master/8131.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55556109063ae7d4b768a7924b9fbbf7"}
