He won the starting job as a Ball State freshman in 2015 and appeared to have the Cardinals poised for a turnaround season after going 4-3 to open the 2016 season. Then the injuries hit and Neal\u2019s career bottomed out.\n\nOn Saturday, the Commodores hope their new starter can rekindle his old magic when he returns to his home state to face Purdue.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to go into this ball game knowing and understanding that his team needs him,\u201d Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \u201cSo let\u2019s get to work. He\u2019s a guy who\u2019s mature enough to understand that.\u201d\n\nPerhaps a change of scenery will help the 6-foot-6, 225-pound fifth-year senior jump start a career some believe could lead to an NFL job.\n\nHe needs to perform better than he did in his Vanderbilt debut last week, going 14 of 25 for 83 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions and no completions longer than 12 yards in a 30-6 loss to No. 3 Georgia.\n\nPurdue (0-1) poses a different type of challenge.\n\nWhile the Boilermakers\u2019 defense isn\u2019t nearly as stingy as Georgia\u2019s, the typically run-heavy Commodores (0-1) may need Neal to play a key role in keeping up with coach Jeff Brohm\u2019s wide-open offense.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a quarterback who has that type of experience, it\u2019s a huge plus,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be big and physical, always try to run the football, open it up when they have to, not beat themselves, let their defense keep them in games as well.\u201d\n\nAnd after blowing a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter at Nevada last week, the Boilermakers want to prove this will not be a repeat of 2018 when they started 0-3.\n\nFor Neal, homecoming week creates one other potential distraction - ticket requests.\n\n\u201cI think I have a handful of just my close family and some friends that are going to the game, nothing out of the ordinary,\u201d he said.\n\nMason expects Neal to handle his responsibilities on and off the field like a crafty veteran.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s homecoming, but I think for him it\u2019s just another ballgame,\u201d Mason said. \u201cHe wants to win. We\u2019ve got to prepare to win. You can deal with all the pleasantries afterward.\u201d\n\nHITTING THE ROAD\n\nVanderbilt is trying to win its second road game in its last three tries, dating to last October\u2019s 45-31 victory at Arkansas. It\u2019s also the second straight year the Commodores have played in Indiana - losing 22-17 at Notre Dame in 2018.\n\nFOUR FOR FOUR?\n\nMoore got off to another fast start with 11 catches for 124 yards with one touchdown against Nevada. It was the eighth time in 14 career games he topped the 100-yard mark. The sophomore, who wears No. 4, now needs one more game to become the fourth player in school history to record nine 100-yard games in his career, joining Steve Griffin, Dorian Bryant and DeAngelo Yancey.\n\nVANDY DEFENSE\n\nThe Commodores allowed Georgia to pile up 481 yards last week but stopped the Bulldogs on six of seven third-down attempts, plus a fourth-down stop.\n\nHONORING T-SQUARED\n\nThe Boilermakers\u2019 home opener will also serve as the official dedication of the renamed Tyler Trent Student Gate at Ross-Ade Stadium.\n\nTrent, who inspired the Boilermakers and the nation as he battled a rare form of bone cancer, died Jan. 1. School officials announced the renaming of the gate in March and Saturday would have been Trent\u2019s 21st birthday. The stripe on Purdue\u2019s helmet will feature the words \u201cForever Our Captain\u201d as a tribute to Trent and a neon green ribbon on their jerseys for the traditional Hammer Down Cancer game.\n\n\u201cHe put things in perspective, like live every day to the fullest no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d star receiver Rondale Moore said. \u201cNo matter how many things he had going on, he would always check on me or make sure I was doing good. No matter how many years down the road, Tyler will always be in my heart.\u201d\n\nTrent\u2019s mother and father, Kelly and Tony; brothers, Blake and Ethan; and best friend, Josh Seals, will be the first people to walk through the gate.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Teresa M.
