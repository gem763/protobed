You\u2019ll just make the quid pro quo happen.\u201d\n\nTrump, for his part, essentially admitted to threatening to withhold aid to Ukraine on the call if they didn\u2019t investigate \u201ccorruption,\u201d apparently referencing Biden and his son, telling reporters on Monday that \u201cif you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nAsman pivoted to Biden, claiming the former vice president voiced a \u201cdirect quid pro quo\u201d when he threatened to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee\u2014at the behest of several Western countries\u2014if Ukraine didn\u2019t dismiss its then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin for corruption. The Fox Business host parroted Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s accusations that Shokin was actively investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s company at the time of his dismissal, an assertion that has long been debunked.\n\nNapolitano agreed that while \u201cthis is probably the end of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency\u201d hopes, it \u201cdoesn\u2019t diminish one iota what the current president is doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it is true, we haven\u2019t seen the whistle-blower complaint and under the law it has to be revealed, if this is true this is an act of corruption,\u201d the Fox analyst exclaimed.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
