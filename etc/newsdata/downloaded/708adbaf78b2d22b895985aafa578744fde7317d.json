Reducing demand for meat and dairy products as well as reducing food waste will be critical in addressing the climate crisis, scientists say.\n\nProfessor Pete Smith from the University of Aberdeen, a lead author of reports by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), spearheaded the letter.\n\nHe said: \u201cEating less meat and dairy in our growing cities is a way to address the climate emergency. Cities can play a crucial role in helping citizens to reduce their consumption of livestock products, and to enable the changes necessary to meet ambitious climate change targets.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace International spokesperson Reyes Tirado said: \u201cMayors are in charge of millions of meals every day.

By decreasing the bulk demand for meat, and thus also for feed, cities can make a tremendous difference regarding their carbon and deforestation footprint.\n\n\u201cWe can still limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, but we need quick action.\u201d\n\nAccording to an EAT-Lancet report, humanity needs to reduce its meat intake by around 90 per cent to stay within sustainable limits. The World Cancer Research Fund recommends avoiding processed meat altogether due to its carcinogenic properties.\n\nCity leaders around the world are increasingly creating ambitious food policies.\n\nNew York City mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that all 1,700 public schools in the city will serve meatless meals every Monday.\n\nAnd in Mexico, the \u201cCome Consciente\u201d programme requires all schools in Veracruz (Mexico\u2019s second-largest state) to serve plant-based meals on Mondays.\n\nThe letter was written ahead of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact (MUFPP) annual gathering in Montpellier and the C40 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen.\n\n\u201cAs scientists working for the public good, we are ready to provide you with further scientific evidence about these important topics during the forthcoming C40 and the MUFPP meetings and beyond,\u201d the letter said.", "description": "More than 60 scientists from 11 countries have signed an open letter calling for governments around the world to cut the quantities\u00a0of meat and dairy served in schools and hospitals.\u00a0 The letter urges mayors\u00a0to do their bit by reducing animal products\u00a0in public canteens as part of a move to \u201cmaintain a safe climate and planet for the future of humanity\u201d.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/16/istock-538339755.jpg"}
