REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic\n\nThe company has held back on marketing the pharmacy benefit plan while it talks to these groups, CVS said.\n\nThe plan, launched a year ago, is based on analyses by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a Boston-based group that assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices.\n\nUsing ICER\u2019s cost effectiveness assessment, CVS decides whether to include second or third medicines entering the market if there are already similar ones in the plan.\n\nOpposition to the CVS plan is part of much broader concerns cited by drug companies and advocacy groups, many of which receive funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Some say that ICER\u2019s analysis based on additional years of \u201cquality life\u201d gained from a given treatment is arbitrary and disregards the costs of drug development and patient needs.\n\nMore than 50 groups, including drugmakers, PhRMA, the industry\u2019s main lobby group, and other advocacy groups, have provided comment during a public input period included in a review by ICER of its assessment methods. Many asked ICER to eliminate price recommendations from its efficacy analyses.\n\nICER has defended its methods, which are based on a widely-used cost effectiveness analysis.\n\nThe soft rollout of CVS\u2019 ICER-related product comes as employer health plan sponsors - its biggest clients - are showing increased concern over their cost for new high-priced drugs, and are considering refusing to pay for them at all, CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said in a recent interview.\n\nIf corporate customers follow through on that threat, CVS said it could change tactics with the plan.\n\nRising drug prices, particularly for expensive specialty treatments for severe or deadly conditions, have pushed annual U.S. healthcare spending to $3.65 trillion, and made them unaffordable for many individuals.\n\nEarlier this year, Novartis AG (NOVN.S) launched Zolgensma, a more than $2 million gene therapy for a rare but deadly disease called spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nThe new CVS program, cited as an example of ICER\u2019s growing influence on U.S. drug pricing, would not apply to such a breakthrough treatment. It is a tiny plan by CVS standards as the company manages pharmaceutical benefits for more than 102 million people and also owns Aetna insurance and a national pharmacy chain.\n\nNOT WIDELY PROMOTED\n\nThe plan\u2019s scope is limited to so-called me too drugs, those where similar effective treatments already exist, and aims to pressure drugmakers to set lower prices. For example, two of three very similar drugs for migraine approved in 2018 could have been excluded, but drugmakers set prices ICER deemed cost effective.\n\nCVS has limited sales and marketing for the plan while it talks to patient groups who oppose it. About 240,000 CVS employees and a few large clients\u2019 employees are enrolled thus far. The company declined to comment on exact membership.\n\n\u201cWe are not widely promoting this program,\u201d Brennan said, adding that CVS is working to address patient groups\u2019 concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, Brennan said some employers are considering refusing to pay for million-dollar treatments like gene therapy. They are saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cover these kinds of therapies no matter what their comparative effectiveness is if they\u2019ve got a really high cost.\u201d\n\nLarge healthcare consultant and brokerage Mercer said it has begun to field similar concerns.\n\n\u201cWe have certainly gotten some plan sponsors saying \u2018What if we don\u2019t cover specialty drugs?\u2019\u201d said David Dross, who runs Mercer\u2019s managed pharmacy practice. Two years ago, it never received any such questions, he said.\n\nSteve Wojcik, an executive with the National Business Group on Health which represents large employers, said he does not believe many will take that drastic step.\n\nStill, ICER President Steven Pearson said employers tell him they worry about their ability to cover everything and have suggested they might drop some high-cost treatments. He said employers can use cost effectiveness analysis to help them manage their spending.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nICER has responded to outside criticism by meeting with patient advocates and by adding new measurements for a drug\u2019s effectiveness, such as the value of life years gained, which does not focus on quality of life improvements, Pearson said.\n\nSince 2015, ICER has published up to a dozen reviews each year of drugs and classes of medicines.\n\nMost U.S. private insurers now use ICER clinical and cost analyses to inform coverage negotiations with drugmakers. ICER funding primarily comes from a non-profit foundation, but drug companies and health insurers provide some funds for ICER-related activities.", "description": "A CVS Health Corp health plan that uses an outside drug pricing group to help it decide whether to cover certain new medicines has gained little traction with customers, according to its top medical executive, and has drawn fierce criticism from patient advocacy groups.", "authors": ["Caroline Humer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436821062&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921WU"}
