We knew more than 100 games were coming to Arcade and that some of the biggest names in mobile gaming were developing titles, but many of those games were secret up until Apple Arcade actually debuted. Over the last few weeks, many players have found themselves completely absorbed in experiences like Assemble With Care, Card of Darkness, and Grindstone, all of which were completely unknown prior to the day they launched.\n\nAnd it looks like that trend is going to continue. Over the weekend, four more games hit the service, led by Pilgrims, a quirky new game from Czech studio Amanita Design, which is best-known for the hand-drawn robot adventure game Machinarium. Pilgrims is a great representation of Apple Arcade as a whole: it\u2019s a wonderfully unique adventure game that\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve played before, the kind of inventive experience that\u2019s become a rarity on mobile. And it was also a complete surprise.\n\nPilgrims is sort of like a classic point-and-click adventure crossed with a card game. The cards represent characters and items, and you start out with just a mustachioed man to use. There\u2019s a map that lets you travel to different locations \u2014 a campfire, a bar, a fishing pond \u2014 where you can interact with the landscape and other characters. If you tap on a worm or an acorn, for instance, that item will then be added to your hand as a playable card. To use a card, you simply select it while in a location and watch what happens. There are puzzles to solve to move through a simple story; early on, you have to figure out how to catch and cook a fish to trade for a bottle of wine, and later, you\u2019ll try to get a bear out of its cave.\n\nSoon enough, you\u2019ll have a handful of objects like lassos, brooms, and gold coins, along with new characters like an angry old lady and a gun-wielding brute. Each has its uses and abilities, and the more you play, the more complex and convoluted the puzzles become. Like most adventure games, the solutions can be a bit silly, and you\u2019ll be using objects in ways that don\u2019t always make a lot of sense. But the card structure makes this less frustrating than it otherwise could\u2019ve been. It\u2019s playful and fun. Instead of constantly clicking through tedious menus, it\u2019s more like you\u2019re experimenting, tossing out cards to see what works. Even if you don\u2019t get the right answer at first, you\u2019ll usually see a fun animation.\n\nEverything is rendered with a hand-drawn art style that makes Pilgrims look like a classic storybook, and, like most of Amanita\u2019s work, there\u2019s virtually no text or dialogue. Instead, you\u2019re able to infer what people want or how they\u2019re feeling through animations and simple comic book bubbles depicting specific objects. In the wrong hands, this kind of design can become horribly frustrating, but as is typical for Amanita games, I rarely found myself stuck or annoyed during the short time it took to play through Pilgrims. It\u2019s a short, sweet, and charming game, the kind you can easily finish in a single evening.\n\nPilgrims is joined by three new Arcade releases, including a space shooter called Redout; 3D adventure mystery The Bradwell Conspiracy; and Nightmare Farm, the latest release from the creators of cat-collecting hit Neko Atsume. The four games couldn\u2019t be more different from each other, and they help further broaden an already diverse lineup of games. Hopefully, they\u2019re a sign that Apple will continue to support Arcade with new and interesting games \u2014 ones that will keep on surprising us.", "description": "Over the weekend, Apple added four surprising new games to Apple Arcade, including Pilgrims, from the studio behind Machinarium, and Nightmare Farm, from the creators of Neko Atsume.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YCl5_wcsmxydVKeHwYQhvyzjjp8=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19266570/Pilgrims_8_3840x2160.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
