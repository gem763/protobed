And Panera Bread does indeed freeze it's mac and cheese. Here's the news you need to know today.\n\nBut first, why do pirates wear eye patches? It\u2019s completely reasonable to assume they wore patches to cover up lost or wounded eyes, but the actual reason is a lot darker. Yarr welcome.\n\nA doctored video of Trump shooting critics is deeply disturbing\n\nA fake, violent video that depicts President Donald Trump killing journalists and a number of his critics was played at a pro-Trump event at his Miami resort last week, according to a report in The New York Times. The White House says the president hasn't seen the video, but he does condemn the contents being reported. The fake video is hard to watch. In an edited scene from the film \"Kingsman: The Secret Service,\" Trump enters a \"Church of Fake News\" and opens fire on members of the congregation, shooting, stabbing and setting fire to various news organizations' logos and political opponents, including Kathy Griffin, Hillary Clinton and the late Sen. John McCain.\n\nMeghan McCain slammed a response from Stephen Miller on Monday after the senior Trump adviser argued the video was \"free speech\" rather than a call to incite violence. \"One of the people in this video is my dad,\" she said. \"This could inspire violence towards REAL people.\"\n\nA fake video of President Trump shooting opponents was played at a conference hosted by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort.

Atatiana \"Tay\" Jefferson, 28, was shot in her home Saturday by Aaron Dean, a white police officer responding to a call from a neighbor who was concerned because her doors were open. On Monday, Jefferson's family demanded an independent investigation of the tragedy and prosecution of the shooter. Ashley Carr said her sister was killed by a \"reckless\" act. \"There is simply no justification for his actions,\" she said.\n\nWho was Atatiana 'Tay' Jefferson? Fort Worth woman killed by cop represented 'honor, integrity.'\n\nProtesters gather at a community vigil outside the house, right, where Atatiana Jefferson was shot and killed by a police officer in Fort Worth, Texas.

Sunday, the hit video game was sucked into a virtual black hole, marking the end of Season 10 and leaving millions of gamers around the world confused (and, I\u2019d imagine, scared). Video of \u201cThe End\u201d shows what appear to be projectiles falling from the sky, followed by a black hole sucking up every single piece of the game, then going dark. The Twitter account for \"Fortnite\" features a single tweet: a live video feed of the black hole. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this event: It's not exactly clear when \"Fortnite\" will be available again. Everybody breathe.\n\nA live video feed from the Fortnite Twitter account shows a black hole consuming the game and leaving it unplayable.

It may have also cost a woman her job. The clip, which has more than 6 million views, shows a Panera Bread worker placing a frozen bag of mac and cheese into a vat of boiling water and dumping it into a bowl. The response to the TikTok video was mixed: One called Panera \"glorified hospital food,\" while another said, \"Alright but it's GOOD hospital food.\" Once the video went viral, the original poster said Friday on Twitter that she \"lost (her) job for this video.\"\n\nA break from the news\n\nThis is a compilation of stories from across the USA TODAY Network.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/14/trump-video-fortnite-fort-worth-shooting-panera-mondays-news/3972033002/", "description": "A fake video of Trump makes the rounds online, and 'Fortnite'\u00a0is in a black hole.
