But what if that web-connected device happens to be your friend\u2019s computer and you forget to log out after you\u2019re done?\n\nGmail actually offers the ability to remotely sign out of devices through its app. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve personally used a few times when I\u2019ve passed a tablet off to a friend to borrow, realising after they\u2019ve left my house that my email was still connected to it.\n\nIs it the worst thing if my friend sees my inbox? Probably not. That said, sometimes there are notifications for things I\u2019ve purchased (perhaps for that friend) or other notes I\u2019d rather stay private than putting them in the face of my pal.\n\nIf you accidentally leave yourself signed in on a device, signing out remotely is super simple.\n\nFirst, sign into Gmail on a device you do have. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select \u201cDetails.\u201d A pop up will then show you all the places you\u2019re currently logged in. Click \u201cSign out of all other Gmail web sessions\u201d to log yourself out on your friend\u2019s computer.\n\nFor devices, you\u2019ll need to go to myaccount.google.com and then \u201cSign-in & security\u201d followed by Device activity & notification. Under the \u201cRecently used devices\u201d portion you\u2019ll see all of the devices that are currently authorised to access your Gmail account. Tap the device you want to revoke access for and then select Remove to remotely sign it out.", "description": "Gmail is great, in that you can check your messages from pretty much any web connected device.
