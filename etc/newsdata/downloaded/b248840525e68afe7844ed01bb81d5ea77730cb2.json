The HFRI World Index, an international hedge fund benchmark, has posted an annual return of just 2.4 per cent over the last five years.\n\nAn adviser to institutional investors about asset allocation, Willis Towers Watson senior investment consultant Aongus O'Gorman, says hedge funds trading shares, currencies, interest rates and other financial assets have struggled largely due to record-low interest rates.\n\n\u201cHedge funds as an asset class generally have not performed anywhere near as well,\u201d O'Gorman says.\n\n\u201cThere is a dampening effect on markets from central bank activities and that creates less breakdowns in relationships between different assets and causes less asset volatility.\u201d\n\nNew career\n\nStevens is not the first top central banker to join the financial markets. His move into part-time hedge fund roles followed former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke who became an adviser to bond fund PIMCO and US hedge fund Citadel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer RBA governor Ian Macfarlane served on the international advisory board of Goldman Sachs from 2007 to 2017 and was a director of ANZ for 10 years.\n\nStevens remains on the board of Macquarie Group, Australia\u2019s most successful international financial services company which has enjoyed outstanding profits and a big share price jump in recent years.\n\nBrett Gillespie is well known in financial markets for anticipating monetary policy movements by the RBA and the US Fed.\n\nEllerston Capital's macro hedge fund, which Stevens officially joined in September 2017 as a part-time adviser, closed in August after failing to make money for investors.\n\nThe fund posted a slightly negative return of -0.77 per cent after fees since inception over two years to July 2019, compared with its stated goal of delivering an annualised 5 per cent net return above the RBA cash rate over rolling three-year periods.\n\nThe fund was a small component of Ellerston Capital\u2019s $5 billion investment pool overseen by Ashok Jacob, a long-time adviser to billionaire James Packer.\n\nThe $200 million Sydney-based fund was run by veteran global interest rate trader Brett Gillespie who previously managed almost $1 billion for global macro powerhouse Tudor Investment in London.\n\nGillespie is well known in financial markets for anticipating monetary policy movements by the RBA and the US Fed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevens has known Gillespie for years from the RBA\u2019s consultations with financial market participants to keep in touch with economic developments.\n\nStevens\u2019 part-time role at Ellerston was to advise the fund\u2019s portfolio managers on international markets and central banks, not specifically the RBA.\n\nHe was not responsible for making the final investments decisions executed by portfolio managers.\n\nStevens declined an interview request about his post-RBA career.\n\nThe Ellerston fund's strongest investment conviction bet was that US inflation and global interest rates would rise. Stevens in 2017 publicly noted the risks of a sharp rise in inflation that would have \"considerable implications\" for financial markets.\n\nStarted to pay off\n\nThe fund's trade started to pay off as US President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, low US unemployment, wage rises and stirring inflation prompted the Fed to raise the funds rate by 1.75 percentage points to a target range of 2.25-2.50 per cent between 2016 and December 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield jumped from about 1.5 per cent to 3.25 per cent by October 2018, boosting the fund's returns from short selling US Treasuries.\n\nThe fund\u2019s portfolio managers were also talking up that inflationary pressures would catch on in Australia and tipped the RBA would be lifting rates in 2018.\n\nVeteran financier Jon Horton of NWQ Capital Management. Stefan Gosatti\n\nBut the interest rate trades ultimately soured when US economic outlook softened, inflation subsided and Fed chair Jerome Powell halted his rate hike cycle and cut interest rates this year.\n\nThe RBA was cutting rates by June 2019.\n\nThe fund\u2019s chief economist, Tim Toohey, quit to join Yarra Capital. The fund\u2019s back-up portfolio manager Robert Chiu had also departed.\n\nAnnouncing the closure to investors in an August letter, chief investment officer Chris Hall said: \u201cThe Fund has experienced a loss of a key member of the team which has changed the profile of the strategy that was originally offered.\u201d\n\nInvestors were delivered their remaining money back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevens had also joined Perth-based NWQ Fiduciary Fund in September 2017 as a member of the investment committee.\n\nNWQ Capital Management, run by veteran financier Jon Horton, had been named Australia\u2019s best hedge fund investor a year earlier by the Alternative Investment Management Association.\n\nYet over the most recent three years NWQ\u2019s fund has returned 2.9 per cent a year versus 11.9 per cent for the S &P/ASX 200 Accumulation Index, according to its website.\n\nSuffered investor redemptions\n\nSince inception in May 2013, the fund is up 5.52 per cent a year, versus the 8.76 per cent benchmark.\n\nThe NWQ fund has also suffered investor redemptions from several wealthy Perth clients and its assets under management have fallen from about $130 million to about $100 million, said market sources familiar with the fund.\n\nHorton was travelling and not available to immediately respond, a colleague said.\n\nNWQ\u2019s performance reflects the wider industry\u2019s struggles because its \"fund of fund\" business model is to invest in a basket of other hedge funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be sure, it is difficult to generalise too much about hedge funds because their strategies differ markedly, ranging across global macro, long-short equities, credit, algorithmic, commodities and merger arbitrage.\n\nAongus O'Gorman of Willis Towers Watson ... investors are anxious about lofty asset valuations.\n\nTheir purpose is portfolio diversification and protection in times of whip-sawing markets.\n\nThe key point hedge fund managers and asset consultants emphasise is ultra-low interest rates have smothered market volatility and hurt their performance.\n\nOne experienced hedge fund manager says his analysis shows the volatility of US GDP and inflation have both halved since the financial crisis, as measured quarterly.\n\nVolatility in asset markets also slumped, with central bank bond buying removing \u201ctail risk\u201d in markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Ronan McCabe, Mercer head of portfolio management, says: \u201cVolatility in all markets and asset classes has been quite muted due to QE [quantitative easing], low rates and central bank liquidity, and that\u2019s not a great environment for hedge funds.\u201d\n\nHedge funds 'have different role'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s wrong to measure the performance of hedge funds against stock market indexes because that\u2019s like comparing \u201capples and oranges\u201d, he says.\n\n\u201cThe hedge funds have a different role in the portfolio and they should really come into their own with outsized returns when equity markets fall like Q4 last year.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest hedge fund, Ray Dalio\u2019s Bridgewater Associates Pure Alpha, rose 14.6 per cent net of fees in 2018, with most of those gains coming late last year as central banks increased rates and the US-China trade war slowed the global economy.\n\nBridgewater counts the Australian government\u2019s $166 billion Future Fund as a client.\n\nThe strong-performing Future Fund had $22.8 billion or 13.7 per cent allocated to \u201calternative investments\u201d as of September 30, overwhelmingly with offshore money managers.\n\nThe local hedge fund market is relatively small by global standards.\n\nIt turns out some strategies can be replicated quantitatively or systematically for a much lower fee. \u2014 Ronan McCabe, Mercer head of portfolio management\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Future Fund is prepared to pay high fees to a select number of perceived quality global hedge funds for highly tailored strategies, often with sophisticated technology-driven institutions.\n\nBut market participants say many local superannuation funds are eschewing the old hedge fund model.\n\nSuper funds are reluctant to pay the high \u201c2 and 20\u201d fees historically demanded by hedge funds (2 per cent annual charge on assets under management and 20 per cent share of profits).\n\nSuper funds typically allocate only about 5 per cent of their portfolio to hedge funds, with some larger funds prepared to go to a 10-15 per cent limit.\n\nInternationally, more pension funds have followed the lead of California's biggest retirement plan, the $US380 billion CalPERS, which five years ago quit hedge funds due to their complexity and high fees.\n\nKim Bowater of Frontier Advisors. \"We do think they can add value, but it has to be a quite specific strategy and managers.\"\n\nAlternative Investment Management Association general manager Michael Gallagher says more retail investors are allocating to alternative strategies or hedge funds, with almost 60 per cent of AIMA's local members reporting they have retail products, compared to less than 20 per cent five years ago.\n\nFees remain under pressure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe advent of machine learning and computer-driven data analysis means hedge fund-like strategies can now be replicated for a fraction of the cost, such as the emerging \"Smart Beta\" strategies like factor investing and systematic trend following,\n\n\u201cIt turns out some strategies can be replicated quantitatively or systematically for a much lower fee,\u201d Mercer's McCabe says.\n\nAsset consultants advising institutional investors believe there remains a valuable niche role for hedge funds.\n\nFrontier Advisors director of consulting, Kim Bowater, says a small allocation to certain hedge fund strategies is appropriate in a diversified portfolio to complement investments in shares, infrastructure and property.\n\n\u201cWe do think they can add value, but it has to be a quite specific strategy and managers,\u201d she says.\n\nAs a general rule Frontier prefers to select global macro funds, managed funds that trade futures known as CTAs, alternative risk premiums such as factoring and insurance securities like catastrophe bonds.\n\nInvestors anxious\n\nBowater says Frontier sees less value in paying expensive fees for long-short equity hedge funds that are closely correlated to products offered by cheaper fund managers.\n\nWillis Towers Watson\u2019s O'Gorman says investors are anxious about lofty asset valuations and unsure how they can generate good returns over the coming years.\n\n\u201cHedge fund strategies that have less economic sensitivity may be of more interest,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut then there is the question of fee budgets and conviction.\u201d", "description": "Two hedge funds that former RBA governor Glenn Stevens joined
