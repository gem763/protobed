Harbinger is coming to Crisis on Infinite Earths. Plus, what\u2019s to come on Batwoman and Riverdale, and some wild speculation about the Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney+ show. Spoilers away!\n\nBlack Widow\n\nNew set photos appear to confirm William Hurt will reprise his role as General Thaddeus E. \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross in Black Widow.\n\nActor William Hurt was spotted on the set of Marvel's \"Black Widow\" movie and there's a theory about what he is filming! https://t.co/7MS69sd4Sr \u2014 JustJared.com (@JustJared) October 1, 2019\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\n\nIn a recent interview with Empire, screenwriter Chris Terrio revealed The Rise of Skywalker will definitively answer, \u201cWho is Rey?\u201d\n\nOne of them is a simple one: \u2018Who is Rey?\u2019 Which is a question that people not only wonder about quite literally, but wonder about in the spiritual sense. How can Rey become the spiritual heir to the Jedi? We kept coming back to \u2018Who is Rey?\u2019, and how can we give the most satisfying answer to that not only factually - because obviously people are interested in whether there\u2019s more to be learned of Rey\u2019s story - but more importantly who is she as a character? How will she find the courage and will and inner strength and power to carry on what she\u2019s inherited?\n\nTremors 7: Island Fury\n\nMichael Gross confirmed on Facebook the seventh entry in the Tremors franchise begins filming in Thailand next month.\n\nAvatar 2-5\n\nJames Cameron carries a 3D camera while ankle deep in water in this new behind-the-scenes photo from Avatar\u2019s official Twitter page.\n\nWave machines, blazing fire, and @JimCameron wielding a 3D camera \u2014 just another day on the set of the Avatar sequels! Thanks to producer @JonLandau for capturing the photo.

And Dutch subtitles!\n\nPumpkins\n\nA search party runs afoul of a man with a rotten gourd for a head in this trailer for the indie slasher, Pumpkins.\n\nCrisis on Infinite Earths\n\nComic Book has confirmed Lyla Michaels will finally become Harbinger in Crisis on Infinite Earths.\n\nBatwoman\n\nTV Line also has our first looks at Gabriel Mann as Hush and Rachel Matthews as Magpie in episodes three and four of Batwoman.\n\nThe CW has also released a new sneak peek and behind-the-scenes fashion shoot for the series.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nAfter speaking with Joel Edgerton, MTV\u2019s Josh Horowitz has \u201calmost no doubt\u201d he will reprise his role as Owen Lars in the upcoming Obi Wan TV series.\n\nCaught up with Joel Edgerton today (check out THE KING! I really enjoyed). I have almost no doubt based on his coy evasiveness that he will be in the Obi Wan Disney+ series. I\u2019ve seen many an actor playfully evade. I\u2019m placing a big bet that Owen will be back. \u2014 Josh Horowitz (@joshuahorowitz) October 1, 2019\n\nAre You Afraid of the Dark?\n\nSpeaking with Bloody-Disgusting, series writer BenDavid Grabinski revealed the new Are You Afraid of the Dark? miniseries includes some deep-cut horror references.\n\nIt\u2019s all very, very deeply nerdy but in a way that if you don\u2019t know the references you won\u2019t know [they\u2019re] references.\u201d The kids\u2019 names are Rachel Carpenter, Graham Raimi, Gavin Coscarelli, Louise Fulci and then Akiko Yamato, and then her brother is Officer Hideo Yamato, which is [referencing] Hideo Kojima. So a bunch of just deeply nerdy stuff. There\u2019s a bad guy in the show, you\u2019ll find out his real last name is Cochran because I really like Halloween III. It\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s like, it passed the smell test. I have a thousand references in it and no one on set knew they were references, which to me is the magical level. It\u2019s like some movies where it\u2019s like, here\u2019s Officer Spielberg and Romero, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s a little too much.\u2019 We all have our own internal barometer over what is too much and what is corny or too obscure. I mean look, I have a kid talking about how his favourite composer is Wang Chung, so I don\u2019t know how many people made a show with ten-year-olds where someone must really like the To Live and Die in L.A. score, but I\u2019m also probably a crazy person.\n\nRiverdale\n\nTV Line has a couple of new photos from the October 23 episode of Riverdale, introducing Jughead\u2019s new high school, Stonewall Prep.\n\nArrow\n\nComic Book also has photos from \u201cWelcome to Hong Kong,\u201d the second episode of Arrow\u2019s final season leading into Crisis on Infinite Earths.\n\nSpace Force\n\nFilming has officially begun on Netflix\u2019s Space Force, starring Steve Carrell and John Malkovich.\n\nIn space no one can hear you scream \u2026 but this show takes place on earth sooooo ???????????? STEVE CARELL HAS STARTED FILMING SPACE FORCE!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/V7uqeZmjrS \u2014 Netflix US (@netflix) October 1, 2019\n\nTell Me a Story\n\nTell Me a Story\u2019s Paul Wesley promises TV Guide more \u201cextreme\u201d takes on fairy tales in season two.\n\nIt\u2019s quite extreme. Not every fairy tale has a happy ending.\n\nVan Helsing\n\nAxel reconciles with Vanessa in the synopsis for \u201cBroken Promises,\u201d the fourth episode of Van Helsing\u2019s fourth season.\n\nAfter an epic battle, Axel reconciles with Vanessa and comes to terms with the death of Scarlett.\n\n[Spoiler TV]\n\nNancy Drew\n\nAnother behind-the-scenes fashion shoot from Nancy Drew includes the ghost from the recent teasers strutting on a catwalk.\n\nAmerican Horror Story: 1984\n\nFinally, Billie Lourd tells real-world serial killer Richard \u201cThe Night Stalker\u201d Ramirez he cannot join her aerobics class in the trailer for \u201cTrue Killers,\u201d next week\u2019s episode of American Horror Story: 1984.", "description": "Chris Terrio discusses the key questions at the core of The Rise of Skywalker.
