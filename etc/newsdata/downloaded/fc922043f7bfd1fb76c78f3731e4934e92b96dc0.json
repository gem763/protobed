To take a position that could harm our company in some form would be a big mistake. I just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s something we should engage in in a public manner.\u201d\n\nSHAQ DEFENDS DARYL MOREY AMID NBA-CHINA FEUD: IN AMERICA, 'WE'RE ALLOWED TO SPEAK OUT ON INJUSTICES'\n\nSeveral prominent figures within the NBA had taken a similar stance, including some who typically have outspoken about politics, including Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr and NBA superstar LeBron James.\n\n\"A lot of us don't know what to make of it, it's something I'm reading about... but I'm not going to comment,\" Kerr told reporters earlier this month. \"What I\u2019ve found is that it\u2019s easy to speak on issues that I\u2019m passionate about and that I feel like I\u2019m well-versed on and I\u2019ve found that it makes the most sense to stick to topics that fall in that category.\"\n\n'SOUTH PARK' RIPS LEBRON JAMES FOR HIS CHINA REMARKS IN LATEST EPISODE\n\nJames knocked Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for his tweet expressing solidarity with the Hong Kong protestors.\n\n\"Yes, we do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you are not thinking about others and only thinking about yourself,\" James said. \"I believe [Morey] wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\"\n\nNBA veteran Shaquille O'Neal, however, defended Morey, insisting that he was \"right\" during the pre-game show on Tuesday.\n\n\"And, one of our best values here in America is free speech. We're allowed to say what we want to say and we are allowed to speak out on injustices and that's just how it goes,\" O'Neal told the panel. \"If people don't understand that, that's something they have to deal with.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShaq continued, \"I just thought it was unfortunate for both parties, and then you have people speaking when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. But Daryl Morey was right. Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say 'that's not right,' and that\u2019s what he did.\"", "description": "Disney CEO Bob Iger is choosing not to comment on\u00a0China\u00a0following the controversy with the NBA, saying he doesn't want to take a position that would \"harm our company.\"", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
