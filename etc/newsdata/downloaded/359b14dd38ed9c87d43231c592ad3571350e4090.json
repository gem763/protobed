Sitting by the pool of the Hotel San Jose on a hot Texas Saturday before her Austin City Limits set, the Alabama Shakes frontwoman can\u2019t help but chuckle about her circumstances. After a decade of recording and touring relentlessly with the Shakes, she can finally relax.\n\n\"Look at me, hanging out by the pool,\" she says. On the heels of her critically acclaimed solo debut, Jaime, life is pretty good for the Athens, Alabama raised singer and guitarist. But despite commercial success, Grammy awards, headlining tours, and the comfort of financial stability, the road Howard traveled to get to Jaime was surprisingly difficult.\n\nAfter the release of 2015's Sound & Color, inspiration suddenly escaped Howard, and the Shakes were left with a clamoring audience and nothing to give them. \"It\u2019s just one of those things where everybody could feel that something was different,\" Howard explains. The band earned four Grammys from 2016 to 2018, but at the height of the Alabama Shakes' success, before Jaime was even an idea, she decided to put her band on hold.\n\nIn late 2017, Howard took a cross country trip with her wife, Jesse Lafser. \"We went on this massive road trip and went all the way out to Oregon, and then from Oregon back to Nashville. From there we went from Nashville to LA. We just went everywhere that we'd never been before. We almost drove to Canada,\u201d she explains. By ending things with the Shakes, Howard inadvertently forced her own hand, practically willing solo music into existence.\n\nShe says, \"Because I had cut ties with the idea of making any more music with Alabama Shakes at that time, I didn\u2019t know what I was gonna do,\" she says. \u201cAfter the road trip I was really like, \u2018Well...what am I gonna do? I\u2019m only good at one thing.' So I decided to make this solo record.\u201d\n\nHoward needed a clean slate, but she had to put everything on the table about her plans for a solo album with the Shakes, a group of people she had spent her entire adult life with. \"Talking honestly and being open about it was the best way to go about things. I really didn\u2019t want to be sneaky. I have respect for them and they\u2019re my family,\" she says about her bandmates. \u201cThe inspiration just wasn\u2019t coming. Once I got some space away from it, there was an aha moment.\u201d\n\nAfter settling into her new life in Taos, New Mexico, Howard departed again, this time to Topanga, California, where she recorded Jaime with Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell, drummer Nate Smith, and keyboard legend Robert Glasper. \"Sometimes I felt like I was crazy. I was like, 'Who does that?' But there was an internal voice pushing me, telling me it would be okay,\" she adds.\n\nThe Alabama Shakes were never a burden, but the various commitments that project entailed began to wear on her. This was a fracture that couldn\u2019t be healed\u2014at least at this point in time. But performing at a late-afternoon slot at ACL, unencumbered by her guitar, it was easy to tell she feels free. \"For ten years I played all of these guitar parts and sang. I was glued to the center of the stage. Now, I\u2019m running around and dancing like an idiot. It\u2019s so fun,\" she says.\n\nThe sticky funk and broken pop of Jaime explodes into technicolor in a live setting, with Howard\u2019s ace backing band allowing her the freedom to plumb the album\u2019s depths on a nightly basis. Named for her late sister that died at the age of 13, Jaime doesn't erase all that Howard has accomplished with the Alabama Shakes; it's a re-birth and a move away from some of the more exhausting aspects of the music hustle. \"It gives me a whole new reason to love what I do,\" she says, adding: \"I\u2019m being more honest than ever.\"\n\nRead on for our conversation with Howard about finally making something that truly felt like her own.\n\nIs it more nerve-wracking putting out an album under your own name?\n\nSomehow not. I don\u2019t really care what anyone thinks. It\u2019s a whole different thing for me. The Alabama Shakes had their own fanbase, and we were always gonna do what we wanted to anyways. When I made this, I pulled the rug out from my under myself and decided that wherever I landed was where I landed. Fuck it, let\u2019s do it. I wasn\u2019t nervous about that. The hardest part of doing this record was getting my inspiration in check. As writers, if you don\u2019t have the muse, what are you even living for?\n\nHow did you find it?\n\nI quit looking for it.\n\nWhat did that muse end up being?\n\nThings just started entering my creative sphere. I started hearing music again. I had to quit trying to write songs and I allowed myself to be open enough to receive ideas.\n\nThe album is very personal, and has some socio-political elements as well. Is it easier for you to dive into those themes as a solo artist?\n\nThat stuff enters regardless of the project. With this record, I really just needed new ingredients. That\u2019s why I had to do it on my own. Also, I didn\u2019t need input. Everyone in the Shakes is really creative and has a lot of ideas. That\u2019s cool, but not for this stuff. I wanted this album to be my vision and what I hear.\n\nWhat sort of stuff were you listening to while writing? The album has so many different sonic elements that are all pretty disparate but flow into each other with ease.\n\nI wasn\u2019t listening to anything while I made the record. Everything that it sounds like is probably an accurate reflection, because that\u2019s my musical education. I didn\u2019t take any theory classes. Everything I\u2019ve ever been exposed to was an education. When I was doing this record, I made it a point to not get too inspired by any one thing. I was just listening to my wife\u2019s music, which is just Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan.\n\nThe record doesn\u2019t really sound like that.\n\n[Laughs] No way. That stuff is so dark.\n\nHow comfortable were you putting such a successful, Grammy award-winning project on pause?\n\nThe hardest part was how close me and my guys are. Our lives have changed together. We went to school together. We\u2019re so entwined. I was trying to explain to them how I was feeling. I didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\n\nIt reminds me of that clich\u00e9, 'It\u2019s not you it\u2019s me.' But in this case, it really was the me.\n\nEverything has its season. It was a lot like a breakup. It was crazy.\n\nIt must have been very intense. Did that inform the record at all?\n\nNo. I think I got a sense of freedom. When you\u2019re in a band, everything you do affects one another. You\u2019re not really free. It's not a bad thing, you\u2019re just tied to other people. Me wanting to do everything I wanted to do was affecting them anyways, because everyone was asking about me all the time. That\u2019s fucking weird! I had a huge sense of freedom just saying, \u2018Okay, now my life is in my hands, and it doesn\u2019t affect anyone else.\u2019\n\nDo the stakes feel lower for this project? Like a side project?\n\nNo, it feels like I opened a door. It\u2019s a new beginning. It\u2019s an introduction, showing everything I can do, and trying to figure out what\u2019s next.\n\nDo you feel an accountability to Alabama Shakes fans to explain this decision? Y'all had such a loyal following.\n\nMy responsibility has, and always will be, to be a creative person. I need to serve up that, because I wouldn't be here without that, and I wouldn\u2019t have any fans without that. The fans I have may want me to remain in this box, but I feel like a lot of them are open-minded people anyways. I have the coolest fans ever. This move may be surprising, and if they\u2019re disappointed, it\u2019ll be okay [laughs].\n\nHow weird is it after so many years playing in a new band and playing new songs after so many years?\n\nIt's really different because I play less guitar. The parts are a little too technical. I can\u2019t be singing and playing these harmonic parts. I'm so much more vulnerable on stage now. I don\u2019t have this guitar blocking me. I'm just standing there. You have to figure out how you\u2019re gonna interpret the music. That\u2019s been really different for me. It\u2019s like a re-birth in a way, but it\u2019s been fucking cool. It\u2019s all so different.\n\nIt must feel really galvanizing and rejuvenating.\n\nI\u2019m in control of the ship. Now I\u2019ve got money, and it\u2019s not about that. When I was traveling the country, we were staying in these nice places, but I was really sad because I wasn\u2019t making music. Now, I feel like I have my cards in a row.\n\nDoes that push ever really go away? To make sure you\u2019re never poor again?\n\nIt can if you want it to. Being aware of what trying to survive all the time does to my reality sucks. You\u2019re always fearful, and what drives you isn\u2019t what you love. You have to get rid of that. That\u2019s some shitty intent.\n\nIn that way, it\u2019s funny you went into music, because it\u2019s so hard to make a living now.\n\nThat\u2019s why I work my ass off touring. It\u2019s all less about money now than I ever thought it could be. This is what I will do for the rest of my life. Watch older me be like, \u2018Ahhh, you dumb bitch! You\u2019re actually a fishing guide now!\u2019\n\nDoes this time away make you want to return to the Shakes?\n\nI don't know. A huge lesson I learned from this record is to follow your creativity wherever it hits. If I have this great idea to work with the Shakes again, we\u2019d talk and decide whether or not to do it. But for now, I\u2019m really excited just to be doing something new and challenging.\n\nWith the Shakes, you have a very charismatic personality and a rabid fanbase. I imagine they think they know you in a way they probably don\u2019t.\n\nThis is the cool thing about this record. Jaime is more me than the Shakes was. That was a part of me, but when Shakes fans would meet me, I feel like they\u2019d expect a big and boisterous personality. They\u2019re always surprised I\u2019m tall [laughs]. With this album, they see me as more vulnerable and sensitive. I\u2019m also more observant. I\u2019m not always fucking loud [laughs].\n\nThis album is also weird, in a really exciting way. Where does that come from?\n\nThat just comes from me being weird. I\u2019m fascinated by things I can\u2019t put my finger on. I love King Crimson, Sun Ra, the odd Temptations records...just the anti-music vibe. I like to take anti-music and make it musical again. It\u2019s fun picking it apart and putting it back together in ways that are familiar but also pretty weird.\n\nHas playing these songs live revealed anything to you that you maybe didn\u2019t realize while recording them?\n\nI didn\u2019t realize the guitar parts would be so hard. I did them all on the record and I tried to play them live at first. I was getting ready for rehearsals, and there\u2019s a song like \"He Loves Me,\" which sounds really simple, but has seven guitar parts. I was like, \u2018Oh shit. I can\u2019t play this.\u2019 I found out there was a lot I couldn\u2019t make happen, and I really had to swallow my pride. I focused on being a performer instead of trying to do everything myself.\n\nWhat do you hope people take away from this album?\n\nI don\u2019t really have any intentions. I just made a record. It\u2019d be nice if people were inspired to be brave as their own selves; just people being cool with themselves and giving some self-love. People look for external validation to make sure they\u2019re good. Just know you\u2019re good.", "description": "The Alabama Shakes frontwoman walked away from her band and found a more colorful vision for her new solo album, 'Jaime.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9e161c24c477000ac9e2c0/lede/1570645438473-GettyImages-1179324770.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8434682804674457xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
