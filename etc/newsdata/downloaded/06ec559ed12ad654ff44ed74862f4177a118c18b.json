A private mission on the International Space Station will cost a minimum of about $35,000 per night. Private astronauts will need to cover the cost of: Regenerative life support and toilet: $11,250 per day\n\nCrew supplies (food, air, medical kit, etc): $22,500 per day\n\nStowage: $105 per day\n\nPower: $42 per kiloWatt/hour\n\nData downlink: $50 per GB\n\nBoeing was among the first groups to begin working on plans for commercial expansion into space under NASA's Commercial Crew Development program in 2010.\n\nThe program was meant to open the ISS to private corporations that had the means of launching their own rockets.\n\nSpaceX recently announced plans for its competitor, Crew Dragon, to send the first manned commercial spaceflight to the ISS in 2020.\n\nEarlier this year, SpaceX became the first private company to send a spacecraft to the ISS, with an unmanned Crew Dragon launch.\n\nSometimes described as astronaut taxis, these taxis are meant for a future when researchers make regular trips into space to work on projects for commercial use.", "description": "The first step was getting to space, and now private corporations are in a race to profit from space. Boeing aims to reclaim its place with an unmanned test flight to the ISS in December.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/16/19699566-0-image-a-8_1571068169306.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
