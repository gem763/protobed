They were YouTube and Instagram stars \u2013 or, more often, aspiring stars \u2013 here to \u201cstorm\u201d Area 51 for the benefit of their followers and free the aliens held captive within. Or at least film themselves talking about it.\n\nJoining them was a ragged army of hundreds of stoners, UFO buffs, punk bands, rubberneckers, European tourists, people with way too much time on their hands, and meme-lords in Pepe the Frog costumes \u2013 all here because of the Internet, the ironic and the earnest alike, for a party at the end of the earth.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThree months earlier, on 20 June 2019, the podcaster Joe Rogan released an interview with Bob Lazar. Lazar is a cult figure in UFO circles; he claims to have studied flying saucers at Area 51, the classified air force base in Nevada where the US government is rumored \u2013 by some \u2013 to make secret contact with extraterrestrial beings.\n\nRogan\u2019s millions of listeners heard the interview.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Joshua tree in the desert. Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian\n\nOne of those listeners was Matty Roberts, a college student, anime enthusiast and video gamer in Bakersfield, California. Inspired by the Rogan podcast, Roberts created a joke Facebook event: \u201cStorm Area 51, They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us.\u201d According to the plan, people would meet in Rachel, Nevada \u2013 the closest town to Area 51 \u2013 in the early morning of 20 September, then swarm the defenses and see for themselves if the government was hiding aliens.\n\nThings snowballed. Within hours, the page had thousands of RSVPs. Within days it had more than a million. The air force warned that things would end badly for anyone attempting a raid. The FBI paid the hapless Matty Roberts a house call.\n\nSo he came up with a brilliant pivot: why not channel this momentum into a Burning Man-style music festival in the desert? He joined forces with Connie West, the operator of Rachel\u2019s sole inn and restaurant, to plan what they called Alienstock.\n\nThen came the first schism. Scornful of the internet interlopers, the Alien Research Center in nearby Hiko, Nevada, decided to host its own Area 51 event the same weekend \u2013 for serious ufologists.\n\nRoberts and West pressed on. But the town of Rachel (population: 54) lacked the infrastructure to handle thousands of conspiracy theorists and gawkers descending on rural Nevada. The local authorities feared potential calamity: people dying of dehydration in the desert, angry landowners, madmen with guns.\n\nThings snowballed. Within hours, the page had thousands of RSVPs. Within days it had more than a million.\n\nOn 10 September, nine days before the event, Roberts backed out. He wanted no involvement in a \u201cFyre Fest 2.0\u201d, he told the media. He accused West of being insufficiently prepared for the coming flood. Budweiser offered to sponsor a free, alternative Alienstock event in a \u201csafe, clean\u201d venue in downtown Las Vegas. Roberts urged people to go there instead.\n\nWest refused to cancel the concert in the desert. She\u2019d already sunk thousands of dollars of her own money into the event, she told reporters as she held back tears. Alienstock would happen, she said, whether anyone liked it or not.\n\nNow there were three rival events all happening on the same weekend \u2013 one in Las Vegas, another in Rachel and a third in Hiko. No one had any idea how many people were coming.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nI came equipped with a duffel bag of Hawaiian shirts and a case of vape cartridges, which I hoped to use as currency in the event of civilizational collapse in the desert.\n\nBut the desert would wait. The \u201cArea 51 Celebration\u201d in downtown Las Vegas did not get off to a promising start. When I arrived, shortly after 7pm, the outdoor venue \u2013 heavily bedecked with glowing neon alien signage \u2013 was mostly empty except for cops and local newscasters. A DJ blasted dubstep to a bare dancefloor. The venue even had a swimming pool, bathed in green light and watched by a bored-looking lifeguard.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matty Roberts. Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian\n\nI feared it might be a long night. I ordered a whiskey-and-water; the bartender filled a plastic stadium cup to the brim.\n\nThen people started trickling in. Everyone was wearing their best alien-themed rave attire: one woman wore a shiny, and discomfitingly rubbery, head-to-toe alien costume. Another had a Rick-and-Morty-patterned dress. Three men tore up the dancefloor in matching alien-motif onesies. Someone carried a sign that said GREEN LIVES MATTER.\n\nI talked to two people who\u2019d driven six hours from Tucson, Arizona, on a whim to attend. One was wearing a Flat Earth Society T-shirt, though he said it was ironic.\n\nI spied Matty Roberts in the center of a swirling mass of people, holding court. He was wearing a Slayer hat and black T-shirt; his long, dark hair flowed majestically down his back. He looked like a heavy metal-listening, Mountain Dew-drinking samurai lord, surrounded by courtiers and supplicants. I fought my way over.\n\nHe was in high spirits. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely amazed at how things turned out, and it\u2019s incredible,\u201d he told me as he signed autographs. I opened my mouth to ask a follow-up question but he was swallowed up again by the crowd.\n\nBy around 9pm, there were a couple hundred people jerking spasmodically to dubstep.\n\nA woman who introduced herself as Shereel (\u201cC-H-E-R-Y-L\u201d) said she was happy to be at the rave but disappointed she couldn\u2019t make the event in the desert.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time since Roswell that people like us are all coming together,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if nothing happens, we tried.\u201d\n\nThe DJ interrupted his set to thank Matty Roberts and give a \u201cspecial shout-out\u201d to Bob Lazar. The crowd cheered.\n\nA warm wind was whipping through the arena. As the wind buffeted us and the rave lights flickered overhead, you could almost believe a UFO really was about to descend.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The alien statue outside the Alien Research Center, Hiko. Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe next morning I got in my rental car and headed north.\n\nThe outskirts of Las Vegas \u2013 casinos, strip clubs, endless billboards for personal injury lawyers \u2013 dropped away rapidly. Now there was just desert in every direction, stunning in its vastness and austere beauty. Mountains towered over the highway, surrounded by hilly plains of cacti and scrub.\n\nSoon most human settlement was gone. There was nothing alongside the highway \u2013 no strip malls, no fast food joints, and, I noticed, worryingly few gas stations. I had at least two hours of driving ahead, though I knew I was going in the right direction: every vehicle I saw was a police car, an RV or a news satellite van.\n\nAs I drove I listened to rightwing talk radio, then Top 40, then country, then a Bible discussion call-in show, then some Spanish-language stations, then static. A talk station interviewed the mother of a police officer killed by an undocumented immigrant. Sean Hannity made fun of the climate strike, and every talkshow discussed the New York Times\u2019 recent, partly retracted accusation against Brett Kavanaugh. It was, they pointed out, yet another sign of bias in the liberal media.\n\nSoon most human settlement was gone. There wasn\u2019t even anything alongside the highway.\n\nThe first gas station was bustling with people buying water and jerry cans of gas. In the parking lot there was a camper van marked \u201cAREA 51 \u2013 HERE WE COME\u201d.\n\nFinally, two hours north of Las Vegas, I saw the exit for State Route 375 \u2013 also known, since its formal renaming in 1996, as Extraterrestrial Highway.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe US government owns thousands of square miles of land in northern Nevada. The area is big enough, and empty enough, to detonate a nuclear bomb \u2013 which the government has, on hundreds of occasions.\n\nThe \u201cGroom Lake airfield\u201d \u2013 Area 51 \u2013 is part of a massive complex of military installations. Their activities are classified and the skies above are restricted air space. Little is known about what goes on there, though the air force tests experimental stealth aircraft, which may account for some UFO sightings.\n\nOf course, military pilots are themselves known to report seeing what they refer to as \u201cunexplained aerial phenomena\u201d. (Even the New York Times has reported on it.)\n\nIn the 2000s, Congress established an \u201cadvanced aviation threat identification program\u201d to study the problem. The program wasn\u2019t classified, but it \u201coperated with the knowledge of an extremely limited number of officials\u201d, according to Politico. The then Nevada senator Harry Reid helped secure the funding.\n\nThat\u2019s the end of the history lesson. The reader is free to investigate further and come to their own conclusions.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nOn the way to Rachel, I stopped at the rival festival at the Alien Research Center in Hiko. It was heavy on souvenir sellers, though there were some hardcore ufologists. A group called the Mutual UFO Network (Mufon) gave me a pamphlet offering certification to be a \u201cfield investigator\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Signs and concertina wire at the Area 51 checkpoint. Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian\n\nIf anything, the ufologists were more the exception than the rule. I had expected most Area 51 Stormers to be conspiracy theorists, 4chan types, or people on the fringe political spectrum, but a lot \u2013 probably most \u2013 were normies on a lark, or foreigners in search of peak Americana.\n\nTwo young men \u2013 one Swiss German, the other Japanese \u2013 told me they were friends who\u2019d met at an English as a second language program in New York. A group of Britons told me they\u2019d been taking a road trip up the west coast, heard about the Area 51 business, and decided to take a detour.\n\nThis was a common theme: \u201cWell, I\u2019d been thinking about taking a road trip anyway, sooo\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWhen my car turned the last switchback into the valley toward Area 51, the car radio, theretofore static, suddenly started blasting Smetana\u2019s M\u00e1 Vlast in eerie, crystal-perfect sound. The aliens, it seemed, were classical music buffs.\n\nRachel came into view \u2013 a tiny, one-horse town besieged by cars and tents and camper vans. Including the cops, EMTs, festival organizers, and so on, there looked to be a couple thousand people \u2013 not the two million who had RSVP\u2019d to the Facebook event, nor the 30,000 the sheriff feared, but more than I thought would follow through.\n\nContrary to the wild warnings about a Fyre festival 2.0, things appeared mostly under control. Festival marshals waved me along to an assigned lot.\n\nMy neighbors at the parking lot-slash-campsite were a punk band called Foreign Life Form. They weren\u2019t part of the planned music lineup, one Life Form explained as he ate Chef Boyardee room-temperature from a can, but when they heard about Alienstock, it seemed like fate. They were trying to find the concert organizer to get added to the billing. To help seal the deal they\u2019d painted their faces and arms green.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A member of the punk band Foreign Life Form, body painted green, eating a can of Chef Boyardee at his campsite. Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian\n\nMy other neighbor, an erudite, joint-smoking history podcaster from Oregon, wore a T-shirt that said \u201cTake me to your dealer\u201d. He and his son had had the shirts custom-made; the Life Forms were disappointed they couldn\u2019t buy some.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nGetting to the actual entrance to Area 51 took another 20 minutes of driving on an unmarked, unpaved road. Clouds of chalk billowed behind the cars coming and going.\n\nAt the end of the road was a drab military checkpoint flanked by concertina wire and threatening signs. The sign prohibiting photography was clearly a dead letter.\n\nRotating shifts of law enforcement officers of every variety \u2013 sheriff\u2019s deputies, state troopers, game wardens, park rangers \u2013 kept a watchful eye on everything. They seemed relaxed, though, and looked like they were having as good a time as the ostensible Stormers. After all, this was an excuse for them to hang out at Area 51, too.\n\n(To my knowledge, no one actually raided Area 51, besides the two Dutch YouTubers who had tried to sneak through the perimeter two weeks earlier and ended up in jail instead.)\n\nIn addition to YouTube vloggers and Instagram influencers, there were more than a few actual journalists. Watching them scurry around diligently with tape recorders reminded me that I needed to find a Quirky Character who could give On-Scene Color. A talkative UFO buff would be ideal but the other journalists had already claimed most of the good ones.\n\nI couldn\u2019t avoid noticing a pair of men in huge, papier-mache Pepe the Frog heads. The vloggers loved them, and the Pepes enjoyed mugging for the cameras. \u201cMy God,\u201d a girl said, \u201cthey\u2019re adorable.\u201d\n\nUnder their frog heads, the Pepes were two young Latino guys from California. When I asked them what they thought of the frog\u2019s association with the alt-right, one seemed confused. The other nodded in recognition but claimed he just thought the symbol was fun.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cMemes,\u201d finished the other. They both laughed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Two Pepe the Frog enthusiasts. They said they were unaware of its alt-right association. Photograph: J Oliver Conroy/The Guardian\n\nI asked if it wasn\u2019t weird for them, as Latinos, to embrace a symbol affiliated with white nationalists.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, they\u2019re a little, like, extreme for me sometimes,\u201d one said. \u201cBut sometimes you feel like they\u2019re right about some stuff.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike clown world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cClown world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the idea that we\u2019re all living in a world of clowns,\u201d he clarified.\n\nTendrils of fog hung over Alienstock. The temperature was dropping fast and the sun was low and pink in the sky. The sunset was sublime but I had a long drive to my motel ahead and a sick feeling that I should have left half an hour ago.\n\nI bid farewell to the history podcaster. He reminded me that the area was open grazing land. \u201cWatch out for the steer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go right out into the road.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe next morning I debated whether to squeeze in another trip out to Alienstock and couldn\u2019t quite find the willpower. It was time to get back to civilization, I decided. Or at least Las Vegas.\n\nI stopped at the gas station in Alamo, near Rachel. The town felt hungover, and it still had a day to go. Most of the locals seemed unsure quite how to feel about the whole thing. It was a boon to the local economy, yes, but also a financial disaster for the county government. There were rumors that the district attorney was planning to sue Connie West, or Matty Roberts, or even Facebook.\n\nMost, though, just seemed excited at the idea that their corner of the world might become something bigger than a gas stop on the way elsewhere.\n\nEveryone vowed that next year, they\u2019d be ready.", "description": "No one had any idea what to expect of a plan for people to meet in Rachel, Nevada, to see for themselves if the government was hiding aliens", "authors": ["J Oliver Conroy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/09/24/FINAL_BY_CONROY.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3cf9e797cd95d60c416f34f9075f2053", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
