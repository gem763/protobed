Those talks, however, fell apart the same day they started.\n\nThe weapons development by Pyongyang also comes at an inopportune time for President Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE, who is consumed by domestic political woes stemming from the House impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHere are five things to know about North Korea's latest missile test.\n\nTest showcased a new missile\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency described the test as a successful launch of its new Pukguksong-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time North Korea has tested an SLBM, but it was a milestone for Pyongyang: It\u2019s the longest-range solid fuel missile to get a trial run by North Korea.\n\nIt\u2019s also North Korea\u2019s first SLBM launch in three years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nU.S. Joint Staff spokesman Col. Patrick Ryder told reporters that the Pentagon assessed the missile to be short- to medium-range. He also said it was fired from a sea-based platform rather than a submarine.\n\nSouth Korea said the missile climbed to 570 miles and flew a distance of 280 miles.\n\nThe lofted trajectory meant it flew higher than normal. If flown on a standard trajectory, experts said, the missile would have a range of about 1,200 miles, putting it squarely in the medium-range category.\n\nMissile presents new dangers, but not anytime soon\n\nA working SLBM, which is more mobile and more difficult to detect before launching, would pose a bigger threat than North Korea's arsenal of land-based missiles.\n\nThe farther North Korea\u2019s submarines can travel, the farther from its shores the SLBM can strike. An SLBM is also considered a key military asset when striking back after a nuclear attack.\n\nAt the same time, North Korea\u2019s submarine fleet isn\u2019t known for its range. The country\u2019s 1990s-built subs are based on the Soviet Romeo-class subs and are thought to have a range of almost 4,400 miles, potentially putting Hawaii within striking distance. But the diesel-fueled subs are noisy and easy to detect.\n\nMissile expert Michael Ellemen said that North Korea is likely years away from having operational SLBMs.\n\n\u201cThe Pukguksong-3 represents another step forward in North Korea\u2019s pursuit of a sea-based deterrent force,\u201d he wrote for 38 North, a site that focuses on Pyongyang. \u201cNorth Korea will also need to build at least three, if not four or five submarines to ensure a constant at-sea presence for the second leg of its strategic arsenal, making operationalization of its SLBMs at least a half-dozen years, or possibly longer, away.\u201d\n\nTest came right before talks\n\nThe test was widely seen as a way to send a signal to the United States ahead of the first working-level nuclear negotiations in months.\n\nNuclear talks stalled in February after Trump walked away from the Hanoi summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Kim Jong UnTo get rid of Maduro in Venezuela, US must challenge his enablers North Korea says it successfully test-fired new submarine ballistic missile Overnight Defense: Trump fumes about impeachment inquiry | Dems say State watchdog turned over 'packet of propaganda' on Ukraine | North Korea tests missile days before talks to resume MORE. The two sides had reached an impasse over how much each was willing to give.\n\nTrump and Kim met again in June at the demilitarized zone on the Korean peninsula and agreed to renew working-level talks. But nothing came to fruition until this past week.\n\nPyongyang, followed by Washington, announced Tuesday that working-level talks would resume within a week. A day later, North Korea launched the SLBM.\n\nOn his way to Sweden for this weekend\u2019s talks, the head of North Korea\u2019s delegation expressed optimism.\n\n\"As the U.S. side sent a new signal, I bear high expectations and optimism, and I am also optimistic about the results,\" Kim Myong Gil told reporters at the airport in Beijing, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency.\n\nBut the negotiations on Saturday were short-lived. North Korea's chief nuclear negotiator told reporters that his delegation decided to break off the talks after the U.S. brought \"nothing to the negotiating table,\" according to Reuters.\n\nIn a statement Saturday afternoon, the State Department said those comments \"do not reflect the content or the spirit of today's 8 1/2 hour discussion.\"\n\nUS wasn\u2019t the only intended audience\n\nWhile the test provided leverage for North Korea going into the talks, the U.S. was not the only country to receive Pyongyang\u2019s message.\n\nThe missile landed within Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone, reminding Tokyo that they are in North Korea\u2019s range.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: House Dems subpoena White House for Ukraine documents | Pence pulled into inquiry | GOP senator says he confronted Trump over Ukraine aid | Iran hackers target 2020 campaign Overnight Defense: Pentagon didn't listen in on Ukraine call | Questions linger over delayed aid | State formally approves M Ukraine arms sale Pentagon: Recent North Korean test was a short- to medium-range ballistic missile MORE and Japanese Defense Minister Taro Kono spoke on the phone after the test and \u201cagreed that the North Korea tests are unnecessarily provocative and do not set the stage for diplomacy,\u201d Ryder told reporters.\n\nThe test also came a day after South Korea had a weapons showcase of its own that many expected would infuriate the North.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Korea publicly displayed its U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets for the first time during an Armed Forces Day ceremony.\n\nPyongyang has previously protested South Korea\u2019s purchase of the advanced fighters as an \u201cextremely dangerous action\u201d and threatened to \u201ccompletely destroy\u201d the aircraft.\n\nMissile test adds to headaches for Trump\n\nTrump has been brushing off North Korea\u2019s missile tests for months, instead talking up his personal connection with Kim and calling the tests \u201cvery standard.\u201d\n\nBut those tests, about a dozen since May, had consisted only of short-range missiles, making the most recent test the most serious since U.S.-North Korea talks began last year.\n\nAsked Thursday if the latest one went too far for him, Trump said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see,\u201d but added that the talks would go on as planned.\n\nThe advancement in North Korea\u2019s weapons program adds to an already-full plate of global issues weighing on Trump at a time when he is most concerned about what\u2019s happening at home.\n\nHouse Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into him related to his desire for Ukraine to investigate leading Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE.\n\nThe North Koreans could be looking to take advantage of the U.S. domestic drama. CNN, citing an unnamed source, reported Thursday that the North Koreans \"sense an opportunity\" right now and perceive Trump as \"politically vulnerable\" and \"starving for a win.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump dismissed the idea that the impeachment probe has any negative effect on his foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of countries in a very good position right now, despite the witch hunt, which hurts our country and it hurts America,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Iran wants to do something. North Korea wants to do something. And China would like to do something.\u201d", "description": "North Korea crossed a major threshold with its weapons program this past week when it test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile, military experts say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/northkoreamissile_100219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
