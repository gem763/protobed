I\u2019m not going to donate to his campaign or anything of that sort either.\n\nYou see, I\u2019m becoming a fan of him because I\u2019m becoming more and more convinced that he\u2019s not really a presidential candidate so much as a performance artist. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s making much sense to me, and in that context, it\u2019s awesome.\n\nWhy is it the only thing that makes sense? Because he thinks that if people don\u2019t want to sell their guns to the government, some fines will be all that\u2019s needed to compel people to change their minds.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke provided insight into how police would enforce his proposal for a government confiscation of AR-15s and AK-47s. The Democratic presidential candidate told reporters he would impose a fine on AR-15 owners to \u201ccompel\u201d them to follow the law and turn in their banned firearms. Owners who turn in the guns will then be compensated. \u201cWe expect our fellow Americans to follow the law. If they do not, there would be a fine imposed to compel them to follow the law,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this implemented successfully in Australia, where you\u2019ve seen a near 50% reduction in gun violence deaths in that country.\u201d\n\nExcept, that\u2019s not what happened.\n\nFor one thing, Australia didn\u2019t just stop with AR-15 or similar rifles but began cracking down on guns of all stripes. If mandatory buybacks were responsible for a reduction in crime, it\u2019s highly likely that laws restricting handguns would have had more of an impact as opposed to a firearm that even today in the U.S. is little used in crime.\n\nFurther, the nation was one that never embraced the right to keep and bear arms quite as Americans did, so they\u2019d be willing to roll over and accept restrictions on their gun rights.\n\nAmericans are different. We\u2019re ornery about our gun rights. Not all of us, but most of us.\n\nI can promise you that if somehow O\u2019Rourke got into the White House and had the opportunity to put his plan into place, I don\u2019t care what kind of fines were put in place, I\u2019m not giving up jack. Neither are most AR-15 owners, from what I can tell.\n\nThen again, O\u2019Rourke thinks he can continue to talk about gun confiscation\u2013and let\u2019s be clear, that\u2019s exactly what a mandatory buyback is, it\u2019s just dressed up to sound a little less totalitarian\u2013and pretend that gun owners will just roll over and accept whatever he says. No. That\u2019s not how any of this works, and the sooner his DUI-driving, failed folk-singing butt recognizes this, the happier everyone will be.\n\nGo ahead. Threaten fines.\n\nI speak for millions of American gun owners when I say just two little words, words passed down from history and immortalized for ages to come. They were uttered by the Spartans, then used in English by Texans.\n\nMolon Labe, big man. Molon Labe.\n\nHat tip: PJ Media", "description": "Beto O'Rourke seems to finally get that American gun owners won't sell their guns to the government on his say so.
