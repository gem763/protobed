Instead, it will be held back until after Mr Johnson\u2019s deal has been defeated \u2013 and staged early next week, as the only solution to the new crisis created.\n\nOne former Tory, now sitting as an Independent, told The Independent: \u201cMost of our group will back the deal but, if we wait until after it goes down, up to 15 will switch sides, plus 10-12 Conservatives with the whip.\n\n\u201cThat would mean a majority for a referendum on the deal, but it\u2019s vital to get the sequence right and not to move too soon.\u201d\n\nPhilip Hammond, the former chancellor, Amber Rudd, the former home secretary, David Gauke, the former justice secretary, and former health spokesman Stephen Hammond are among ex-Tories who have left open the option of backing a referendum.\n\nA Commons majority for a referendum became dramatically more likely after Mr Johnson took the enormous gamble of signing a deal in Brussels without DUP support \u2013 something No 10 had insisted he would never do.\n\nAsked if Mr Johnson would win the vote, one government source replied: \u201cI am not getting into the hubris of saying \u2018we think we have got the numbers\u2019.\u201d Privately, Downing Street fears losing by around 20 votes.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

admitting many of the party\u2019s MPs were still \u201cthinking hard\u201d whether to back it.\n\n\u201cWe have to respond to events as they occur and be as pragmatic as we can,\u201d she said, explaining the shift from only backing a referendum on a \u201ccredible\u201d deal.\n\nLabour whips believe they can whittle down the number of its MPs voting against a referendum to under 20, down from more than 30 opponents.\n\nMargaret Beckett, the Labour co-leader of the People\u2019s Vote political committee, hailed the switch, saying: \u201cLabour\u2019s decision to back a People\u2019s Vote on any Brexit proposal is a game changer.\u201d\n\nThe number of Labour MPs backing Mr Johnson\u2019s deal is expected to be \u201cin single figures\u201d, after he weakened Theresa May\u2019s commitments to maintaining workers\u2019 rights and environmental and safety protections.\n\nThe clearest mechanism to secure a Final Say referendum is to attach it to an agreed deal \u2013 as proposed by the Labour backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.\n\nMr Kyle said he was \u201craring to go\u201d, but added: \u201cI\u2019m not saying if we are going to push it on Saturday or not.\u201d He added: \u201cThe next 12 hours, the next 24 hours will be decisive.\u201d\n\nA decision not to stage a referendum showdown on Saturday could be a disappointment to hundreds of thousands of people who will be outside parliament as the debate takes place, on The Independent\u2019s Let Us Be Heard rally.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, the prime minister was bullish, saying: \u201cI am very confident that, when my colleagues in parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday.\u201d\n\nBut, hours earlier, the DUP appeared to torpedo his chances of success, accusing Mr Johnson of threatening the Union and the \u201cprofessed sanctity\u201d of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe Tories\u2019 Northern Ireland allies said they would vote against it because it created a customs border in the Irish Sea, with no power for Unionists in the Stormont assembly to block it.\n\n\u201cThese proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic wellbeing of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union,\u201d the DUP statement said.\n\nSteve Baker, the chairman of the hardline European Research Group of Conservative backbenchers, said he was still undecided.\n\nThe government had hoped as few as three or four Tory Brexiteers would vote against \u2013 but that total could double without the DUP on board.\n\nEarlier, MPs saw off a government attempt to frame Saturday\u2019s showdown as a \u201cdeal vs no deal\u201d choice \u2013 by winning the right for multiple amendments, by just 12 votes.\n\nIt means Mr Johnson will be required, under the Benn Act, to seek a Brexit delay \u2013 to avoid a Halloween crash-out \u2013 if his deal is rejected.", "description": "Exiled Tory MPs kicked out of the party by Boris Johnson
