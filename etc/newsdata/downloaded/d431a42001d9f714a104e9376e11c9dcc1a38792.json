But today\u2019s kids spend far less time playing than their parents did.\n\nMariana Brussoni, a professor at the University of British Columbia and BC Children\u2019s Hospital \u2014 featured in The Nature of Things documentary The Power of Play \u2014 has spent years researching the benefits of play that have an element of risk. Risky play for children, she explains, is \u201cthrilling and exciting play where children engage in risk without certainty,\u201d and it has been proven to have immense benefits.\n\nThe benefits of risky play\n\nRisky play involves kids experimenting and pushing themselves to figure out what will happen, without knowing the exact outcome. If kids don\u2019t go far enough with their play, it\u2019s boring and if they go too far, it gets too scary, Brussoni explains. She likens it to a science experiment, where kids are testing out their environment and determining what they\u2019re comfortable with.\n\n\u201cWhen we have kids engage in play, it\u2019s really a fundamental way for them to figure out the world \u2014 how the world works, how their body works,\u201d says Brussoni, adding that these little experiments are all done \u201cin context of a relatively safe space.\u201d\n\nRisky play in early childhood can help develop a child\u2019s self-confidence, resilience, executive functioning abilities and even risk-management skills. And Brussoni\u2019s work in injury prevention research shows that engaging in risky play can actually reduce the risk of injury, too.\n\nBrussoni gives the following tips for parents on how to put riskier play into action.\n\nFocus on \u2018as safe as necessary\u2019 over \u2018as safe as possible\u2019\n\nConsider a playground. Things such as needles on the ground or broken equipment would be cause for parental intervention, whereas navigating a bush with thorns at eye-level, for example, would be something you could involve the child in.\n\nRather than removing the plant altogether, Brussoni advises assessing the situation together, having the child take stock of the thorns and then suggest ways to stay safe. Balance the risk with the benefits, she says.\n\nProvide guidance\n\nBrussoni suggests that when you walk your child to school every day, it can be helpful to take the time to point out the potential dangers so that they gradually reach a point where they have enough knowledge to stay safe. This builds confidence and prepares them for solo adventures.\n\nMORE:\n\nFrom bonobos to sheep, lots of animals enjoy play as much as we do\n\nUnstructured play can create mentally healthier kids\n\nDon\u2019t let your own fears get in the way\n\nParents\u2019 fears can get in the way of giving their children freedom. Worries about kidnapping and injury, and the fear of people thinking they\u2019re bad caregivers can drive many parents to intervene before their child can engage in risk during play.\n\nBut statistics show that the likelihood of a child in Canada getting kidnapped is 1 in 14 million \u2014 similar odds to winning the lottery. And recent estimates show that children would need to spend about three hours per day playing, every day, for 10 years before they were likely to get an injury that needed treatment (and it would likely still be minor).\n\nBrussoni and her team of researchers have developed an online tool called Outsideplay.ca, which informs parents on making informed choices regarding risky play for their children.\n\nPractice the 17-second rule\n\nInstead of telling your child not to climb so high or run so fast while observing them at play, take a moment \u2014 or, as Brussoni advises, 17 seconds. Step back, she says, and \u201csee how your child is reacting to the situation so that you can actually get a better sense of what they\u2019re capable of when you\u2019re not getting in the way.\u201d\n\nBrussoni explains that this will provide them with \u201cthe opportunity to figure out for themselves what\u2019s comfortable and what they can do,\u201d while allowing them to develop those all-important risk-management skills.\n\nGet out of the way\n\nIn The Power of Play, Brussoni states that the most important thing parents and guardians can do is get out of the way: provide children with an environment for play and then let them play.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that optimal risky play is unsupervised. For younger kids, it may simply be about facilitating and supporting children in how they want to play, rather than guiding it .\n\n6 key factors to risky play: Play with heights, such as climbing trees or structures Play at high speeds, such as a fast game of tag or riding a bike really fast Play with tools, such as building a fort or whittling a stick Play near elements, such as playing near fire, water, a cliff or something that a child could fall into Play with a chance of getting lost, such as wandering the neighbourhood with friends unsupervised, or simply hiding in the bushes for younger kids. Rough-and-tumble play, such as play fighting \u201d\n\nProvide time, freedom and space for good play\n\nBrussoni emphasizes that parents need to carve out enough time to let children play, despite a high volume of homework and extracurriculars. Kids need to be afforded the freedom to play the way they want to, without being limited by the mindset of their guardians.\n\nHigh-quality play also requires space \u2014 both physical and psychological. In terms of physical space, there needs to be enough of it, and it has to be of good quality (more on this later). Psychological space, Brussoni explains, \u201cinvolves the feeling that somebody has their back\u201d so that kids \u201cfeel like they have the latitude to try and try these experiments.\u201d\n\nCreate a play space with loose parts and materials\n\nBrussoni and her team are currently developing a playability index to find out what elements are necessary to create a high-quality outdoor play space in neighbourhoods.\n\nIn her interviews with hundreds of children, one factor stood out: the freedom to build on imagination. In the typical North American playground, equipment is fixed and the options for play are limited; there is only so much you can do with a slide, monkey bars or swings.\n\nInstead, Brussoni\u2019s team recommends removing all this structure, and instead providing loose materials such as logs, mud, tarps, crates, sticks, planks, ropes and even water to play with.\n\nThese elements can often be found in nature, vacant lots and even junkyards, but the most important element in any play space is, again, the psychological and physical space to take risks.\n\nTo learn more, watch The Power of Play on The Nature of Things.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/PowerOfPlay_RiskyPlay_1920.jpg"}
