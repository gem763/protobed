Will his campaign?", "language": "en", "text": "The fact that 78-year-old presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders had emergency heart surgery after a campaign event Tuesday leaves his campaign with two uncertain prognoses: one medical, the other political.\n\nThe medical one is far simpler.\n\nThe procedure Sanders had \u2014 the insertion of mesh tubes, or stents, to prop open a full or partially blocked artery and allow easier blood flow \u2014 is \u201cnot a big deal, mechanically speaking,\u201d said Valentin Fuster, director of the Mount Sinai Heart Center in Manhattan, adding that \u201cin general patients do very well.\u201d\n\nThe questions of why the blockage occurred in the first place and what future risks Sanders might face are more complicated, Fuster said. \u201cIs there high blood pressure, or diabetes, or high cholesterol? There are many issues that must be looked at before coming to any conclusion.\u201d\n\nSanders had the procedure after experiencing chest pain while campaigning in Nevada late Tuesday afternoon, and was reported to be recovering in an unnamed hospital.\n\n\u201cSen. Sanders experienced some chest discomfort,\u201d campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in a short statement. \u201cFollowing medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted. Sen. Sanders is conversing and in good spirits. He will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

Sometimes it takes the form of a debate of the old ways versus the new ones, and 76-year-old Joe Biden in particular has been portrayed by opponents as belonging to a bygone time.\n\nBut physical health has also been raised as a concern, as these candidates battle for a job that has been known to age much younger men. Last month, Biden, Sanders and 70-year-old Elizabeth Warren all pledged to release full medical reports before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nSo if Sanders \u2014 sometimes called the Energizer Bunny because his energy rarely seems to flag \u2014 is physically well enough to get back on the campaign trail, will he be politically healthy enough?\n\nHis medical troubles come at a time when his poll numbers have been slipping, notably against Warren, but just a day after his campaign reported the best quarterly fundraising total of any Democrat this cycle: more than $25 million.\n\nFor the moment, the speculation about the political effects of Sanders\u2019s heart procedure seems limited to celebratory tweets from longtime Trump supporters and \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d messages from a few journalists.\n\nCampaign speechwriter David Sirota aimed to spin the news to talk about health care, tweeting, \u201cI\u2019d encourage media reporting on stents to point out that stents are an example of why we need to join the rest of the industrialized world and pass @BernieSanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan,\u201d with an attached article about how much more expensive stents are in the U.S. than in other countries.\n\nDirect attacks on age are frowned upon in modern campaigns, as evidenced by the side-door allusions to Biden\u2019s age so far in this one. During the second presidential debate, for instance, Juli\u00e1n Castro was widely criticized for seeming to bait Biden, asking repeatedly if he had \u201calready forgotten what you just said.\u201d", "description": "The fact that 78-year-old Sen.
