There I said it! The matte glass back is elegant. The OLED display is slightly brighter than I expected, which is clever.

But considering how expensive top-of-the-range phones are becoming, it's become increasingly normal for people to keep their phones for longer and consider longer contracts.\n\nThis is also the highest amount of data available on a 36-month iPhone 11 Pro plan right now.\n\nWhile Telstra does have a plan that is 42 cents cheaper a month, it only comes with 15GB data:\n\nVodafone's offering is $103.58 (before any potential loyalty discounts are applied) but only comes with 80GB data:\n\nSo if you're after an iPhone 11 Pro on a sub-$100 contract and don't mind a 36-month commitment, this could be a winner for you.\n\nAs Gizmodo editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
