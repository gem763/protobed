Order!'\n\nThough the Brexit era may represent a high watermark for incivility, imploring MPs to behave civilly and follow the rules has always been an essential part of Bercow's job.\n\nHis style is unique and memorable. He's known for shouting \"Order!\" \u2014 often many times in a row. During a chaotic Brexit vote a few months ago, Bercow hushed a simmering House by urging members to show \"Zen. Restraint. Patience.\"\n\nIn another instance, he bellowed at MP Michael Gove: \"Behave yourself. Be a good boy, young man!\"\n\nHe has also been known to respond to those who disagree with his style that he does not give \"a flying flamingo\" what they think.\n\nBritish MPs have a tough job ahead of them: figuring out what to do with Brexit. John Bercow might have a more challenging task. As Speaker of the House of Commons, he's the one trying to keep order. 3:22\n\nHe described his job as a continuous work in progress, in which he urges MPs to listen before replying and to keep their tempers in check.\n\n\"You don't achieve order and keep it permanently. You have an orderly situation and then there can be a conflagration over something,\" he said.\n\n\"I try to be fair and I try to be humorous, and I think I've got better at it over the years.... But, you know, I sometimes get it wrong.\"\n\nA 'Marmite character'\n\nOne thing Bercow says he didn't get wrong was his decision to reveal that he had voted Remain in the Brexit referendum.\n\n\"I knew in my heart as well as in my head that I'd been scrupulously fair in the chamber between Brexiteers and Remainers,\" he said.\n\n\"So the idea that it would cause me to be excoriated and that people would say, 'Ah, this is proof of his bias' didn't at the time occur to me.\"\n\nThough the disclosure prompted criticism from Tory MPs that Bercow had betrayed his bias, he says he stands by his choice despite the \"minor grief\" it has caused.\n\nBercow captured during a heated moment during the Brexit debate in March. (Reuters)\n\n\"I didn't think there was anything objectionable about saying in the referendum, as a private citizen, this is how I voted.\"\n\nWriting in the Guardian earlier this year, political correspondent Jessica Elgot said that Bercow had inspired \"more fear, anger and adoration than any other [Speaker] in the role in recent history.\"\n\nBercow acknowledges his bombastic style isn't everyone's cup of tea.\n\n\"I am something of a Marmite character,\" he said, referring to the salty British spread that people typically either love or hate.\n\n\"People must make their own assessment as to whether I've been a fearless champion of the rights of parliamentarians individually and Parliament institutionally, or whether they think I'm a terrible bugbear of whom they can't wait to be rid.\"\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nOne of his missions, he says, has been to interest and excite young people in the machinations of government. Bercow speaks regularly to students and he is the first Speaker to preside over the U.K. Youth Parliament in the House of Commons, something he has done annually over the past decade.\n\n\"I feel that if we want \u2014 as largely middle-aged [politicians] \u2014 ever to be respected by young people, we must show some respect for young people,\" he said.\n\nAs for what's next, Bercow says he's \"keen still to make some contribution to British public life in the future, and to be able to speak up on big issues.\"\n\nStill up in the air is the possibility that Bercow will be elevated to the House of Lords \u2014 the traditional next step for House of Commons Speakers.\n\n\"We shall have to see whether that happens,\" he said.\n\nFor now, Bercow is content to close this chapter of his career as an MP and Speaker, which he describes as \"the greatest privilege and honour of [his] professional life.\"\n\n\"Although I've no plans to die tomorrow, if I were to die tomorrow, I would die happy,\" he said.\n\nWritten by Kate McGillivray and Talin Vartanian.
