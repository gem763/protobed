As anticipated, the production of a film based on his thinly veiled autobiographical novel about what really happened during that fateful Montauk summer has unleashed an opportunity for the Showtime drama to dig into the fact that, yeah, Noah sucks. This week, he sucks for some pretty specific reasons.\n\nThings start off well, with Noah being interviewed by a Vanity Fair reporter about his upcoming new book, but more important, being asked the question of whether \u201cthe redemption of Noah Solloway is complete?\u201d It\u2019s a massive ego stroke for him, but it\u2019s quickly followed up by a series of back-and-forth head-butting scenes with Sasha Mann, the movie star (and at this point, while it\u2019s never been explicitly stated, let\u2019s assume he\u2019s also the director) driving the film adaptation of Descent.\n\nSasha\u2019s frustrated by aspects of the script, including the ending, and his frustrations over the character of \u201cDaniel\u201d eventually bleed over into real life, as Sasha puts it to Noah like this: \u201cYou can\u2019t see yourself and you never could, and that\u2019s why you never get what you want.\u201d It fits, because much of the conflict Noah experiences over how Descent is being interpreted for the screen speaks to that essential cluelessness.\n\nUnfortunately, this episode doesn\u2019t do a lot to indicate whether Sasha\u2019s words make Noah recognize that hard truth, because instead what we get is the reveal that after that final confrontation, a rewrite of Descent\u2019s script happened (probably Sasha\u2019s rewrite) while Noah blacked out. Unless the pages that were submitted were Noah\u2019s, written in a Kerouac-esque (Joel\u2019s comparison) haze? It\u2019s unclear as presented by the episode, along with the new issue of how much more Noah will be allowed to be involved with the production, given his behavior here. Screaming at PAs, dude \u2014 not a good look.\n\nNoah\u2019s version of events doesn\u2019t make him look good, but Helen\u2019s section of the story makes him look even worse, even though her version doesn\u2019t align much at all with Noah\u2019s. With many Helen versus Noah episodes, there\u2019s at least a little more sympatico between their individual sections, but the clash between Noah\u2019s memory of a silly karaoke night and Helen remembering a Negroni in a quiet bar before a confrontation with Noah feels like a rare miscalculation for this show\u2019s otherwise balanced approach to unreliable narrators. It\u2019d be one thing if the two of them remembered different people singing different songs onstage, but this instead feels like we\u2019re looking at two completely separate nights, except that they\u2019re presented side-by-side.\n\nOf course, Helen\u2019s got a lot more going on than just hanging out with Sasha Mann and the film crew; Sierra, mother of Vik\u2019s child, is leaning on her hard for help (even if that help comes in the form of \u201ctraditional\u201d methodology like making sure a baby doesn\u2019t go hungry and feeding it with formula when breast milk won\u2019t suffice). Plus, her mother Margaret is pressuring her hard to move back to the East Coast so that Helen can help with her father\u2019s descent into senility, and Noah can\u2019t stop hassling her.\n\n\u201cI have a house full of people,\u201d Helen says at one point. \u201cI have a life here,\u201d she says at a different juncture. And there\u2019s a beauty to that, to this strange and unconventional existence she\u2019s cobbled together, with so many different people she cares about under her roof. Helen has been through so goddamn much, and seeing her get a new grasp on happiness with Sasha, even as she brings into balance all of the other elements of her world that threaten to collide, creates a whole new level of appreciation for her as a character. This woman has been through a lot. But we never worry about her ability to get through it, whether or not it\u2019s fair that she has to do so.\n\nI mean, we knew the lady was cool, but then (at least according to Noah\u2019s memory) her karaoke song pick was Liz Phair\u2019s \u201cDivorce Song\u201d? Who cares if she can sing \u2014 that\u2019s a flat-out baller choice.\n\nMeanwhile, in a completely other place and time, Joanie Lockhart is fumbling her way around Montauk; breaking into her father\u2019s house to discover it empty but full of family photos, especially photos featuring her dead mother Alison. Between that and the lack of power, she ultimately seeks out a new place to stay, and a local bartender to keep her company. Joanie gets to reiterate her anti-kids stance (it should be a crime to have them, she says), put a bit more future tech on display (her foldable screen, able to store both photos and video, is pretty nifty) and also remind us that past, present, or future, the solution to your problems is not dangerously rough sex, no matter how bad the climate might be, or how screwed up your family history is.\n\nSo far, Joanie\u2019s sections of the narrative have been playing more like vignettes than fully fleshed-out stories, but as occasionally frustrating as these brief glimpses can be, there\u2019s real potential for them to add up to something fascinating, once the full story is told. Just another reason to be excited for the fact that this is going to be the final season \u2014 it\u2019ll be sad to see The Affair go, but it feels like we\u2019re in for a hell of an ending.\n\nThere Is No Objective Truth (Just Bullet Points)\n\n\u2022 Should Whitney ever get her own POV section? On the one hand, the eldest Solloway child has been a pivotal character for this series, one who has only ever been seen through the eyes of others and thus never gotten her due. On the other hand, it\u2019s Whitney. The fact that she\u2019s really attempting adulthood now doesn\u2019t make up for years of being one of TV\u2019s most annoying teenagers.\n\n\u2022 Between the casual reveal that Joel is now the sole principal of Noah\u2019s school and Noah coming by Janelle\u2019s house to find it in full campaign mode, the quick catch-up on what Janelle\u2019s been up to since ghosting Noah three months ago was handled pretty well. I\u2019m curious how much more of the season will involve her, even though she\u2019s still a series regular.\n\n\u2022 Speaking of series regulars, Omar Metwally is still in the opening credits, but maybe it\u2019s a good sign (for Helen, that is) that Vik\u2019s ghost didn\u2019t end up haunting her this week. She might really have a chance to move on.\n\n\u2022 If you live in L.A., then you know that this show is not shy about showcasing familiar locations. \u201cThe best restaurant in Los Angeles,\u201d according to Margaret\u2019s friend, was I believe filmed at Ysabel in West Hollywood, and of course, the nightclub Los Globos in Silverlake was host to Sasha\u2019s karaoke night.\n\n\u2022 Sasha\u2019s \u201cgift\u201d to the crew of a night of karaoke and drinks is definitely well-intentioned \u2026 but he literally began his speech with the mention that a lot of them had been working since 6 a.m. Maybe, Sasha, they\u2019d more appreciate going home early?\n\n\u2022 Also, a karaoke night that\u2019s not overrun by musical-theater kids is wildly out of character for Los Angeles (even on the east side of town).\n\n\u2022 Because Showtime released its screeners for the first three episodes without the new credits, it wasn\u2019t until after the premiere that I was able to watch them. And the starker use of chiaroscuro hues, along with the back-and-forth dissolving of faces, is striking in its beauty, in this show\u2019s uniquely dark way.", "description": "The production of Descent has unleashed the opportunity to dig into the fact that, yeah, Noah sucks.
