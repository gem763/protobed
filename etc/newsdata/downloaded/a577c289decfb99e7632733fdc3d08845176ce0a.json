The staff captain then wanted to meet with me and get a copy of the photo. We easily determined the cabin number since it\u2019s on the hump,\" the Sun reported Blosic wrote.\n\nBlosic was not impressed by her actions.\n\n\"Just witnessed this on Allure. What an absolute IDIOT. You cannot fall off of a ship unless you are acting like a moron!\" he wrote.\n\nSecurity was notified and the guests \u2013 the woman and her companion \u2013 debarked later on in Falmouth, Jamaica. They weren't allowed back onto the boat, which originally left port on Sunday, Fishman said.\n\nIn its Guest Contact Policy, Royal Caribbean specifically notes that \"sitting, standing, laying or climbing on, over or across any exterior or interior railings or other protective barriers, or tampering with ship\u2019s equipment, facilities or systems designed for guest safety is not permitted.\"\n\nAnd one of the consequences is removal at next port of call.\n\n\"Guests removed from a Royal Caribbean International ship pursuant to this policy are responsible for their own accommodations and transportation home, at their expense. Documentation requirements for re-entry into the guest\u2019s home country are also the responsibility of the guest,\" the policy reads.\n\nFor this situation, Royal Caribbean tacked on an additional consequence listed as potential in their policy: Denial of future boarding.\n\n\"[They] are now banned for life from sailing with Royal Caribbean,\" Fishman added.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Blosic for comment.\n\nFollow Morgan Hines on Twitter: @MorganEmHines.\n\nRoyal Caribbean targets Vanuatu: For first carbon-neutral private cruise destination\n\nCruise ship secret spots: Where to find them on Carnival, Norwegian, Royal Caribbean\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Royal Caribbean Cruises bans guest for life after dangerous selfie", "description": "Doing\u00a0it for the 'gram?\u00a0Royal Caribbean Cruises doesn't seem to think that's a good idea, particularly when it's dangerous.", "authors": ["Morgan Hines", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
