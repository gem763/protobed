On entering the factory, officers found victims between 15 and 28 years old and arrested two people on the scene.\n\n\u201cThe pregnant women were brought from Rivers, Cross River, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Abia, and Imo states,\u201d Elkana confirmed. \u201cTwo suspects namely Happiness Ukwuoma, [a female of] 40 years old [sic], and Sherifat Ipeya, [a female of] 54 years old, were arrested in connection with the case. The suspects did not receive formal medical training but operate as nurses.\u201d\n\nElkana explained that the women were allegedly abducted by the suspects after being promised work as domestic staff. Instead of providing them with employment, they intended to rape and impregnate them before selling their children to potential buyers.\n\nThe criminals running the \u201cfactory\u201d sold boys at a higher price than girls \u2014 about 300,000 naira ($828.18) for girls and 500,000 naira ($1380.30) for boys.\n\nOne of the victims spoke of how the suspects promised her significant payment after delivering the baby.\n\n\u201c[A] woman came to pick me at the [bus] park and brought me here,\u201d she told the local Vanguard newspaper. \u201cThe next day, I was summoned by our madam, who told me that I would not leave the premises until next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far, I have slept with seven different men before I discovered I was pregnant,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was told that after delivery, I would be paid handsomely.\u201d\n\nThe main suspect has been identified as \u201cMadam Oluchi,\u201d a mother of five children. She still remains at large.\n\nThe Lagos State Commissioner of Police has passed the case over to the State Criminal Investigation Department. Police say the victims need counseling and rehabilitation following their traumatic experience.\n\n\u201cThe command is working with other agencies and stakeholders in rehabilitating and resettling the pregnant girls and the babies,\u201d Mr Elkana added. \u201cAn investigation is ongoing and the suspects will be charged to court soon.\u201d\n\nReports claim so-called \u201cbaby factories\u201d are not uncommon in Nigeria, with several raids taking place in the past year, including one where a shocking 160 children were rescued from captivity.\n\nIn some cases, single pregnant women are promised healthcare for themselves and their offspring, only for their child to be kidnapped. In other cases, women are raped and impregnated. As noted by the BBC, the babies are usually \u201csold for adoption, used for child labor, trafficked to Europe for prostitution or killed for ritual purposes.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Police in Nigeria successfully raided and rescued 19 pregnant girls from an alleged \"baby factory\" in the suburb of Ikotun.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-187691529-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
