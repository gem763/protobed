We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe will be looking at the 10-game main slate starting at 7:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nJake Odorizzi - Minnesota (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nOdorizzi checks in as a strong -300 moneyline favorite in a home date with a White Sox offense that ranks 20th in wRC+ this season. The last time \u201cOdo\u201d faced this divisional foe (Aug. 28), he posted eight strikeouts with two earned runs through six innings. I\u2019m expecting a similar result tonight for a Minnesota team looking to clinch the AL Central. Odorizzi should help that mission with a quality start and victory this evening.\n\nAlso Consider: Gerrit Cole, Aaron Civale\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nCarlos Santana - Cleveland (vs. Detroit)\n\nSantana is my favorite overall first baseman in the evening slate, as he\u2019ll step in against Detroit RHP Spencer Turnbull (.357 wOBA vs. LHB) and a generous Tigers\u2019 bullpen. Santana went 1-4 with a double and three runs against Detroit yesterday, and he should continue to jump on the favorable matchups.\n\nAlso Consider: Trey Mancini, Austin Nola\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nLuis Arraez - Minnesota (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nStory continues\n\nMinnesota checks in with the highest run-scoring projection of Wednesday\u2019s main slate, and I\u2019m definitely interested in stacking Twins\u2019 hitters through all DFS formats. White Sox RHP Ivan Nova looked sharp through the majority of July and August; however, regression has taken hold after allowing 18 earned runs and 35 hits over his last four starts (17.1 IP). Arraez has multi-hit upside against Nova\u2019s .350 wOBA split to left-handed bats.\n\nAlso Consider: Ozzie Albies, Cavan Biggio\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nEugenio Suarez - Cincinnati (at Chicago Cubs)\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Jon Lester isn\u2019t the same dominant pitcher he used to be. In fact, the veteran southpaw has allowed 18 hits and 12 earned runs across 10.2 innings over his last two starts. Those problems could persist against Cincinnati tonight, and Suarez is one of the best candidates to take advantage. The Reds\u2019 third baseman carries solid numbers against Lester throughout his career, and Suarez is establishing himself as one of the best hitters in the league with 47 homers, 101 RBIs, and a .271 average.\n\nAlso consider: Rafael Devers, Mike Moustakas\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nJorge Polanco - Minnesota (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nI\u2019m going to build a Minnesota stack of left-handed (or switch) hitters to jump on Nova\u2019s aforementioned .350 wOBA split to that side. Polanco is a moderately-priced lift within that despite smacking two doubles, one homer, five runs, and four RBIs over his past five games.\n\nAlso Consider: Nico Hoerner, Brandon Crawford\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nEddie Rosario - Minnesota (vs. Chicago White Sox)\n\nRosario is one of my favorite overall hitters in this slate, as his salary isn\u2019t too cumbersome when considering the excellent matchup potential against White Sox RHP Nova. The Minnesota left fielder tends to produce in waves, and he\u2019s seeing the ball well after collecting seven hits, three homers, and six runs over his past four starts.\n\nKyle Schwarber - Chicago Cubs (vs. Cincinnati)\n\nCincinnati RHP Tyler Mahle has allowed four or more earned runs in four of his last five starts, and that could easily continue at Chicago tonight. Mahle\u2019s .394 wOBA split to left-handed bats stands out as the most obvious blemish in his portfolio, and Schwarber stands to take advantage with capable power upside.\n\nAlso consider: Max Kepler, Andrew Benintendi, Bryan Reynolds, Kyle Lewis, Nick Markakis, Matt Joyce", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for the evening slate on Wednesday, September 18.
