Kavanaugh, later appended with important missing details, need to \u201cwake up and understand that it isn\u2019t media \u2014 it\u2019s left-wing Democrat Party activism!\u201d\n\nThe radio host told listeners Monday that occasional public apologies and clarifications by the newspaper\u2019s staff are just for show, meant to mitigate outrage before continuing with an agenda to \u201cintimidate, scare, [and] frighten conservative judges into not taking the gig.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the Times\u2019 Saturday piece on an anti-Kavanaugh book titled \u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\u201d and its reiteration of charges by Deborah Ramirez that that the future Supreme Court judge had once put his penis in her face when the two were undergraduate students at Yale University.\n\nAs corroboration, the book and article break for the first time Max Stier\u2019s claim that he had seen Justice Kavanaugh expose himself as other students pushed his genitals into a female student\u2019s hands.\n\nThe newspaper deleted a tweet and offered the following clarification after coming under fierce criticism.\n\n\u201cThe book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article,\u201d the Times added.\n\nBut Mr. Limbaugh warned that journalistic missteps are deliberate, and irrelevant to mainstream-media outlets\u2019 actual goals.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t embarrassing for the New York Times,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh responded. \u201cThey\u2019re in their editor\u2019s newsroom rubbing their hands together and saying, \u2018We did it again!\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, folks. I can\u2019t join the chorus of people shocked and saddened by what the Times has done here \u2019cause I\u2019m not shocked by any of it, and I\u2019m not saddened by it. I\u2019m ticked off that everybody seems to think the Times screwed up here! It just tells me how hard the job going forward is going to be in continuing to educate people about the media, who they are today, what their objective is, and how they don\u2019t do news. There isn\u2019t any news in journalism today because there isn\u2019t any journalism in the upper echelons of Drive-By Media.\u201d\n\nThe conservative also blasted the Times for referencing Mr. Stier as a former classmate who \u201csaw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party,\u201d without mentioning his ties to the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cMax Stier, who is behind this latest bogus attempt to paint Kavanaugh as some serious sexual abuser, was working for Clinton when Kavanaugh was on the Starr investigation,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cSo Ken Starr is investigating the Lewinsky thing, which led to Clinton losing his law license because he was lying under oath and suborning perjury (trying to get other people to lie). Max Stier, who went to Yale with Kavanaugh, was working for Clinton during the Starr investigation on which Kavanaugh was an investigative member. You think there isn\u2019t a little payback going on? And the media knows this. But they don\u2019t report that because they purposely do not want any of their readers to think that Max Stier might be motivated here by something other than truth, other than the facts of the story.\u201d\n\nThe Times referred to Mr. Stier as someone who \u201cruns a nonprofit organization in Washington,\u201d but ties to power players in the Democratic Party were not included.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times is out trying to destroy him again,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said, a reference to coverage of uncorroborated allegations of sexual misconduct made by Christine Blasey Ford. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any media accountability \u2026 How do you hold the media accountable? One of the ways you hold \u2018em accountable is to wake up and understand that it isn\u2019t media. It\u2019s left-wing Democrat Party activism!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
