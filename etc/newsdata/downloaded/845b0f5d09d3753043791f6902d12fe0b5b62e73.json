Mike Lee said. The driver's door was opened at one point, and Dhaliwal shut it as the driver remained in the vehicle. When Dhaliwal turned to walk back to his patrol car, the driver steps from the car \"almost immediately running with a gun already out,\" Lee said. The driver shot the deputy from behind, hitting him in the back of the head. The driver got back in his car and drove away.\n\nA deputy a short time later found a nervous man matching the description of the driver in a business at a nearby strip shopping center, Lee said. A woman believed to have been a passenger in the car also was taken into custody. Their identities haven't been released.\n\nDhaliwal, 42, was pronounced dead at Memorial Hermann Hospital, Fox 26 Houston reported.\n\n\"I\u2019m sad to share with you that we\u2019ve lost one of our own,\" Gonzalez tweeted Friday. \"There are no words to convey our sadness. Please keep his family and our agency in your prayers.\"\n\nGonzalez's predecessor as sheriff, Adrian Garcia, implemented a religious accommodation policy that allowed Dhaliwal to wear the traditional turban and beard of the Sikh religion. The deputy was a father of three children.\n\nAMBER GUYGER, WHITE DALLAS EX-COP, SAYS SHE WAS 'SCARED TO DEATH' WHEN SHE SHOT BLACK NEIGHBOR BOTHAM JEAN\n\nGonzelez recounted how Dhaliwal worked with United Sikhs, an international nonprofit, non-governmental, humanitarian relief, human development and advocacy organization affiliated with the United Nations. Dhaliwal worked with the nonprofit to organize the donation of supplies for first responders after Hurricane Harvey devastated the county. He also went to Puerto Rico to help with relief after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said he and his wife were mourning the deputy's loss and sending their sympathies to his family and law enforcement members.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"This tragic loss is a grave reminder of the risks that our law enforcement officers face every single day,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"I thank the officers who bravely responded to apprehend the suspect, and I assure you that the state of Texas is committed to bringing this killer to justice.\"", "description": "A Texas sheriff's deputy who was shot multiple times from behind while conducting a\u00a0traffic stop on Friday afternoon has died, police said.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Sandeep-Dhaliwal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
