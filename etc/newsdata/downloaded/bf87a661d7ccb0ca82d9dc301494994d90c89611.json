And while diplomatic representatives of the Syrian Democratic Council, the governing body of the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria, have already expressed tentative support for this high-risk scheme, it is difficult to see what they will gain from signing up to it. In its current form, Trump\u2019s shift in policy encourages Turkey to expel them from their homes further north, and exile them to the hostile and inhospitable deserts of Syria\u2019s wild east at the mercy of a chaotic and seemingly faithless American ally.\n\n\u201dThis plan can't survive in Syria. I doubt it could even survive for long in the Trump White House\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you stand up a force in eastern Syria when you've just dropped your primary client, the YPG, and you\u2019ve gutted the coalition you built over several years?\u201d said Aron Lund, a fellow with the Century Foundation think tank. \u201cYou throw the YPG to the wolves, and a week later you start recruiting for new allies?\u201d\n\nLund said the proposal could possibly be a \"ploy to boost the YPG's negotiating leverage as U.S. forces withdraw, by letting them sell their control of some oil fields in return for amnesties and security guarantees,\" but he warned against it.\n\n\u201cEither way, I hope the YPG and other SDF fighters realize that this isn\u2019t real \u2013 it\u2019s not going to last. Because if this is poorly handled, they will take the fall for America\u2019s blundering, and it could be really bad,\" Lund told VICE News. \u201cGoing back under Assad\u2019s rule is going to be really grim, regardless. The last thing you need in that situation is an external power deciding to raise the stakes for its local clients even further, and then just pulling out and leaving.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is exactly what the United States appears to be planning.\n\n\n\nJeffrey, Trump\u2019s embattled Syria envoy, has reportedly assured local Deir Ezzor journalist and activist Omar Abu Leyla that American forces will stay in Deir Ezzor for the long haul, protecting the local Arab tribes from both a resurgence of ISIS and the return of Assad\u2019s authority, beefed up by Iranian-backed militias viewed with deep antipathy by the local population.\n\n\u201cThe protesters will continue non-stop rejecting any presence of the Assad regime and Iran in Deir Ezzor\u201d\n\nIn the weeks before Trump\u2019s shock decision, the region had seen growing protests on the western side of the Euphrates, controlled by Damascus, of local tribesmen seeking to come under the authority of the then-US-backed SDF. The return of Assad\u2019s government will be disastrous for local populations who have tied their fates to America\u2019s continued presence.\n\nRead: Trump\u2019s Betrayal of the Kurds Is as Incoherent as It Is Dangerous\n\nOmar Abu Layla told VICE News that \u201cthe entire population opposes this withdrawal and clearly rejects any withdrawal,\u201d fearing it will allow both ISIS cells to regroup and stage a comeback, and the oppressive Assad government to return to power in the region. \u201cPeople have been protesting on a daily basis, expressing their refusal of the withdrawal, and they will not accept it at all.\u201d\n\nHe said a return to the government\u2019s rule is not an option: \u201cThe protesters will continue non-stop rejecting any presence of the Assad regime and Iran in Deir Ezzor.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the return of Assad\u2019s rule to the West Bank of the Euphrates has seen numerous accusations by local tribesmen of reprisals by government forces and Shia militias under Iran\u2019s control, with the U.S.-controlled eastern bank functioning as a refuge area for a long-marginalized and under-resourced section of the country\u2019s population, who happen to live upon the country\u2019s greatest reserves of petroleum wealth.\n\nComplicating the already muddled plan to utilize these tribes as the bedrock of a vestigial Syria policy is the awkward fact that the local SDF forces recruited from among them, the Deir Ezzor Military Council, are the least disciplined and least effective component of the entire SDF. On previous extensive reporting trips to the region, YPG commanders cautioned VICE News against spending too much time with them, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t know who these people are, and we don\u2019t trust them,\u201d and expressing their fears they would either rob or kill us without YPG supervision.\n\nRecruited hastily to put a local face on counter-ISIS operations in a culturally alien and hostile region, the Deir Ezzor Military Council has the dubious record of being the only SDF unit to film and post videos of its members committing the unlawful execution of captives. Widely believed by YPG commanders to be penetrated by ISIS operatives, the Deir Ezzor Military Council or any new force recruited from among its members will be a less congenial military partner than the YPG-dominated SDF, particularly in a region where strong sympathies for ISIS still exist, and where the SDF was even before the American pullout struggling to contain a growing and effective ISIS insurgency.\n\n\"What happens if \u2014 or more likely when \u2014 Russia, Iran, and Assad start to test us in the east?\u201d\n\nSurrounded by a hostile and growing ISIS insurgency, cut off from resupply by both the Iraqi government and Iranian-backed militias within Syria, and Russian forces keen to win back Assad\u2019s control of these vital oil resources, American forces will face what Brett McGurk, former envoy to the Coalition to Defeat Daesh, has termed a \u201cFort Apache\u201d scenario. Strangers in a hostile land, their security will depend on whatever demoralized, exiled fragments of the SDF survive Turkish assault and a local tribal militia of dubious loyalty and effectiveness.\n\nAs a plan, it is just barely possible to achieve, said Jennifer Cafarella of the Institute for the Study of War: \u201cIt is viable insofar as we can, in theory, pull it off militarily. We could establish or retain one or more bases in Deir ez Zour province and provide aerial resupply in addition to air support.\"\n\nWhether it is advisable, however, is another matter entirely. Cafarella notes that \u201cit\u2019s more complicated politically. What happens if \u2014 or more likely when \u2014 Russia, Iran, and Assad start to test us in the east? Thus far we\u2019ve demonstrated a tactical ability to defend against specific attacks, but we may face an attempt by Russia to compel us to withdraw by threatening our air assets.\u201d\n\nThe logistical and political obstacles to this plan are manifold, but the moral arguments against it are even starker: America will find itself deserting its SDF allies to the loss of their homes and family lives, expecting the survivors to reform themselves into a mercenary oilfield-protection force, all while Trump publicly denigrates them. As Lund observes, \u201cThe United States has misled its Kurdish allies time and time again. Over the past couple of years, American diplomats have pressured the YPG to not adjust to the actual balance of power on the ground by preparing a solution with Damascus. They told them American troops were there to stay, they had nothing to worry about. And as bad as that is, it would be just scandalous if they're going to do it again. Because of course an enclave like this can't survive in the long run. It\u2019s out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by hostiles, with no legal foundation to stand on, even in terms of U.S. law.\u201d\n\nLunded added: \u201cEven if Trump can be cajoled into approving it, it would have only the flimsiest American commitment imaginable, and that\u2019s going into an election. This plan can't survive in Syria. I doubt it could even survive for long in the Trump White House.\u201d\n\n\u201dThey told them American troops were there to stay, they had nothing to worry about. And as bad as that is, it would be just scandalous if they're going to do it again.\u201d\n\nSam Heller of the International Crisis Group likewise characterized the Deir Ezzor proposal as the morally bankrupt product of a misguided and chaotic State Department. \u201cIf the U.S.' counter-ISIS achievements can only be sustained by an open-ended, illegal presence in Syria, that is a sign that the U.S.'s counter-ISIS mission is gravely misconceived,\" he said. \"That's to say nothing of the idea that U.S. forces would just sit on top of some oil fields as the U.S.' main local partner in the fight against ISIS, the Syrian Democratic Forces, are left to fend for themselves. Choosing to extend the U.S.' protection to some dubiously useful oil but not to the U.S.' partners as they attempt to defend their home communities would seem unspeakably dark.\u201d\n\nIn any event, America\u2019s role in the Syrian civil war has already moved from a battle between warring factions within the Trump administration over who to support to an object of inquiry for academic historians.\n\nIn a historic seven-hour meeting in Russia\u2019s Sochi on Tuesday, Erdogan and Putin hammered out an agreement carving up northeast Syria between them and settling this phase of the Syrian war for good, freezing out America and cementing Russia\u2019s role as the new arbiter in the Middle East.\n\nThe YPG, according to this deal, will withdraw from northeast Syria\u2019s borderlands, and joint Russian and Turkish patrols will secure the border to Erdogan\u2019s satisfaction. An alternative plan to use Western Iraq as a base for counterterror operations in Syria was shot down by the Iraqi government, which gave the US four weeks to leave the country. Perhaps not since the Suez Crisis, which marked the steep decline of British power in the postwar world, has imperial might declined so precipitously and humiliatingly in the region, and it is clear that the State Department will have to reflect solemnly at the root causes of this dramatic policy failure.\n\nIn the most charitable possible interpretation, America\u2019s Syria policy under the helm of Jeffrey, an old Turkey hand edging toward retirement, was outfoxed by a more capable and united Turkish government. Promises were made and broken to America\u2019s Syrian partners, and as a consequence, hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been forced to flee their homes, possibly never to return.\n\nAs Jeffrey faced Congress, where he was forced to defend his record in the face of bipartisan opposition and stern condemnation of every NATO partner aside from Turkey, the Pentagon attempted to sell a vague version of this scheme to the American people. As a serious policy proposal, it is unlikely to last beyond the end of the month. As an attempt to salvage something from what may be the greatest failure of American diplomacy in a decade, it will be the merest footnote on a sad and cautionary tale to future U.S. governments and American allies alike.\n\nCover: Fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-allied Kurdish-led rebel group, patrol through the then-Islamic State-held village of Baghouz in the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor.
