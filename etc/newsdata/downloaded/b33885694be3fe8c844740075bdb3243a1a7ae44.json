The central bank has burned through nearly $1 billion in reserves since Wednesday, but has failed to stem the peso\u2019s slide.\n\nRelated Coverage Argentines wait at banks to withdraw cash as currency controls kick in\n\n(Argentina risk graphic: here)\n\n(Currency control: here)\n\nFernandez is the clear front-runner ahead of the Oct. 27 general election. His vice presidential running mate is former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a free-spending populist who applied trade and currency controls during her two terms from 2007-2015.\n\nHer presence on the ticket has caused concern about the return of the interventionist left to power, although the more moderate Alberto Fernandez has said he alone will set policy.\n\nLONG LINES AT BANKS\n\nUnusually long lines formed at banks in Buenos Aires on Monday, with depositors looking to withdraw dollars or pesos from their account, despite the government saying the financial system remains solid.\n\n\u201cAll these people are taking out what they have, or part of what they have, because they\u2019d rather keep their cash at home at this stage,\u201d 61-year-old depositor Julio Novoa told Reuters.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man shows Argentine pesos outside a bank in Buenos Aires' financial district, Argentina August 30, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci/File Photo\n\nHaving announced changes to Argentina\u2019s bond payment schedule last week, the application of currency controls was the second measure by Macri that flew in the face of his promise to use orthodox policies to straighten out the chronically troubled economy. Macri\u2019s new controls may be difficult to back out of later, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe problem with restrictive, emergency measures is that they are easier to apply than to retract,\u201d said Buenos Aires-based financial analyst Christian Buteler in a tweet.\n\nMore peso weakness was expected ahead. \u201cThe game has changed for the foreign exchange market,\u201d said Sabrina Corujo, an analyst with Buenos Aires brokerage Portfolio Personal, warning local stocks and bonds were set to weaken as well.\n\nThe central bank has been authorized to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves to prop up the peso.\n\nMacri won the presidency in 2015 on promises of \u201cnormalizing\u201d Latin America\u2019s No. 3 economy by ditching the controls favored by the previous administration.\n\nArgentina\u2019s benchmark international 2028 dollar bonds dropped more than 2 cents to a new low of 36.5 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Bonds maturing in 2038 recorded similar losses.\n\nArgentina\u2019s euro-denominated sovereign bonds also suffered hefty losses to hit record lows. The 2022 bond dropped more than 10 cents to 34.45 cents while the 2027 issue tumbled 7.2 cents to 33.501 cents, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nAmerican depository receipts (ADRs) of Argentina\u2019s financial institutions also came under pressure. Grupo Financiero Galicia\u2019s Frankfurt-listing tumbled 9.15% while Banco Macro SA fell 6.5%.\n\nMonday was a U.S. holiday, which could help control losses in Argentine asset prices by reducing trading volumes, Buteler tweeted.\n\nThe risk premiums demanded by investors to hold Argentina\u2019s dollar bonds over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries rocketed to 2,534 basis points on J.P. Morgan\u2019s index of hard-currency emerging market bonds. Those levels were last seen in the wake of a major 2001 default.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nCapital controls are \u201ca sign of distress in the market and reflect that the new parameters on Argentina are weak and when the peso weakens further it weighs on the credit profile,\u201d said Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.\n\n\u201cThere remains a lot of pressure on the currency ... There\u2019s a limit to what they can do without capital controls.\u201d", "description": "Argentine bond prices fell to record lows on Monday and the official and black market pesos diverged after the country imposed capital controls in a bid to stem a currency rout that is sharpening the risk of default.", "authors": ["Hugh Bronstein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425521959&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810SQ"}
