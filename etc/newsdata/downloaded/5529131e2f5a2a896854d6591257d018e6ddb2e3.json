Normally, the only food you\u2019ll find there is what\u2019s called marine snow: tiny specks of organic material falling from the surface. And that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many critters crawling or swimming at the bottom. But once in a while, the stuff falling from above is a lot bigger \u2013 whale-sized, if you will. Whales, of course, are enormous \u2013 weighing up to 180 metric tons. So when they fall to the bottom, they can sustain entire ecosystems \u2026 for years.\n\n\u201cJust think of the amount of calories in a whale here. They are the equivalent of so much marine snow it\u2019s hard to even compare. It\u2019s not even digested all the way.\u201d\n\nNarrator: That\u2019s one of the 31 scientists aboard the Exploration Vessel (E/V) Nautilus. A ship that explores the seafloor. In the fall of 2019, the crew came across this baleen whale more than 3,000 meters down. And by the time they arrived, it was overrun with octopuses. More specifically, Muusoctopus robustus:a little-known purplish species that inhabits the deep sea.One even photobombed the camera! What\u2019s strange is that octopuses are predators \u2013 they don\u2019t usually eat dead tissue, which is why experts think they were feasting on other critters on top of the whale carcass. Such as crustaceans or snails. They likely use the suckers on their tentacles to pick up their prey and then carefully transfer them from sucker to sucker into their mouths. It\u2019s like a feeding conveyor belt. But if those octopuses look eerie to you, wait until you learn about the bone-eating worms called Osedax. There are so many of them here that it looks like the whale skeleton is coated in algae! These worms have no mouths and no guts. Instead, they secrete acid to dissolve bone and then they rely on bacteria to do the rest.\n\n\u201cSo these are worms that have symbiotic associations with bacteria. They have no more gut themselves. Instead, they have these rootlets that burrow into the bone and then the bacteria are able to metabolize the fats and oils that are in the bone themselves.\u201d\n\nNarrator: In other words, they basically outsource digestion! You\u2019ll also notice some eel-like creatures swimming around. As it turns out, they\u2019re not actually eels, but likely long-bodied fish known as eelpouts, which have a taste for decaying whale blubber.\n\nChad King [Research Specialist at Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary]: We saw one or two in particular grab onto flesh and do what we were calling an alligator roll \u2013 spinning around to twist off pieces of flesh.\n\nNarrator: The researchers also saw other kinds of worms, crabs, and a plump lobster, which they joked may have been fat from feeding on the whale.\n\nChad King: He was a little lethargic and maybe not going to be able to swim away too fast.\n\nNarrator: In fact, a lot of these animals look pretty full.\n\n\u201cSo, you just had a big meal \u2026 it\u2019s like post-Thanksgiving, right? You just have to sit on the sofa.\n\n\u201cOh, my God, all of them!\u201d\n\nNarrator: With so many animals feeding on the carcass, it can degrade in less than a decade and considering how vast the ocean is, stumbling on one only months after it died is really lucky.\n\nChad King: Whale falls are very rare, relatively, and the chance encounter like this was really important for science.\n\nNarrator: For example, it will help researchers better understand these elusive, deep-sea animals like those bone-eating worms, which is one reason why they were so excited.\n\n\u201cWow, this is incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dinner bell ringing, right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are so excited up here. Just saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, this is so cool. This is amazing.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
