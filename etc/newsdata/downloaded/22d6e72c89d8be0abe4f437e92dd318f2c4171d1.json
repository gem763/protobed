You can follow a 16:8 plan like Jen, which requires fasting for 16 hours and eating normally for eight. Or, there's the 5:2 diet\u2014fasting two days per week, and eating normally for the other five. In general, experts agree that intermittent fasting may help you lose weight\u2014but it could also leave you fatigued and hangry.\n\nHalle Berry also swears by an intermittent fasting diet:\n\nReese Witherspoon, 43, on the otherhand, said she just prefers to eat light in the a.m.: \"I just have a green juice and a coffee in the morning.\"\n\nIt'll come as a surprise to no one that Reese and Jen both follow vigorous workout routines, too. They both said they work out at least five time a week. Jennifer, who wakes up at 9 a.m., said she aims for five workouts a week (starting her day with a celery juice, plus meditation and a workout), while Reese rises at 5:30 a.m. and hits the gym by 7:30 a.m. \"I probably do that six days a week,\" she said.\n\nBtw, it's totally safe to work out while fasting\u2014as long as you feel okay doing so, experts say.\n\nWhatever Jen and Reese are doing, it's clearly working!\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Reese Witherspoon (kinda) does it too.", "authors": ["Kate Dwyer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SeZmsTcRRCqgM.YT_bTbzw--~B/aD0zNzM7dz03NDM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/5ec378594dd502cee3e20079181b1640", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
