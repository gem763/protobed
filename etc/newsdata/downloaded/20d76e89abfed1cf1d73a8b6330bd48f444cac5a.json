But an aid group working in Kirkuk said several Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Iraqi soldiers had been killed in an overnight clash south of the city - the only serious fighting reported.\n\nAs Iraqi forces advanced, Kurdish operators briefly shut some 350,000 barrels per day of oil output at two large Kirkuk fields, citing security concerns, oil ministry sources on both sides said. But production resumed shortly thereafter following an Iraqi threat to seize fields under Kurdish management if they did not do so, according to the sources.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether or when the Iraqi government would seek to retake control of all Kirkuk oilfields, a vital source of revenue for the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).\n\nThe short suspension in production helped push up world oil prices as the shutdown represented more than half of total Kurdish output.[O/R]\n\nA dozen Iraqi armored vehicles arrived at the provincial government headquarters in Kirkuk and took up positions nearby, alongside local police. They pulled down the Kurdish flag and left the Iraqi flag flying.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF KURDS FLEE\n\nThousands of Kurdish civilians fled the city of 1 million people for fear of reprisals. A Kurdish father of four who was driving out of Kirkuk towards the Kurdish regional capital Erbil to the north said: \u201cWe no longer feel safe. We hope to return to our home but right now we feel it\u2019s dangerous for us to stay.\u201d\n\nCrowds of ethnic Turkmen who opposed Kurdish control of the city were celebrating. Some drove in convoys with Iraqi flags and fired shots in the air.\n\n\u201cThis day should become a holiday, we\u2019re so happy to have gotten rid of Barzani\u2019s party,\u201d said a man celebrating on a motorbike, waving the blue-and-white flag of Iraq\u2019s Turkmen, referring to the Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that Washington would not take sides in the matter but \u201cwe don\u2019t like the fact that they\u2019re clashing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had for many years a very good relationship with the Kurds as you know and we\u2019ve also been on the side of Iraq, even though we should have never been there in the first place.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials called for calm on both sides, seeking to avert an all-out conflict between Baghdad and the Kurds that would open an entirely new front in Iraq\u2019s 14-year-old civil war and potentially draw in regional powers such as Turkey and Iran.\n\nThe Baghdad central government considers the Sept. 25 Kurdish independence referendum illegal, especially as it was held not just in the autonomous KRG region but in Kirkuk and other adjacent areas that Peshmerga forces occupied after driving out Islamic State militants in 2014.\n\nThe Peshmerga moved in after Iraqi government forces collapsed in the face of a rapid onslaught by Islamic State, preventing the jihadists from seizing the oilfields.\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi ordered that the national flag be hoisted over Kirkuk and other disputed areas.\n\nBaghdad described its army\u2019s advance as largely unopposed, and urged the Peshmerga to cooperate in keeping the peace.\n\nThe Peshmerga said Baghdad would be made to pay \u201ca heavy price\u201d for triggering \u201cwar on the Kurdistan people\u201d.\n\nDECISIVE STEP AGAINST KURDISH SECESSION\n\nThe overnight advance was the most decisive step Baghdad has taken yet to block the independence bid of the Kurds, who have governed an autonomous tract of northern Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and voted three weeks ago to secede.\n\nKirkuk, one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse cities in Iraq, is located just outside the autonomous Kurdish zone. Kurds consider it the heart of their homeland; they say it was cleansed of Kurds and settled with Arabs under Saddam to secure control of the oil that was the source of Iraq\u2019s wealth.\n\nShi'ite Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) celebrate on the outskirts of Kirkuk, Iraq October 17, 2017. REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani\n\nWashington, which arms and trains both Iraqi federal forces and the Peshmerga to fight Islamic State militants, urged \u201call parties to immediately cease military action and restore calm\u201d, according to a U.S. Embassy statement.\n\n\u201cISIS (Islamic State) remains the true enemy of Iraq, and we urge all parties to remain focused on finishing the liberation of their country from this menace.\u201d\n\nU.S. Defense Department spokesman Colonel Robert Manning declined to speculate on whether Washington might cut off military aid and training to Iraqi forces in the event of a major conflict. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on that but I will tell you that we\u2019re looking at all options for planning considerations ... We encourage dialogue,\u201d he said.\n\nState TV said Iraqi forces had also entered Tuz Khurmato, a flashpoint town where there had been clashes between Kurds and mainly Shi\u2019ite Muslims of Turkmen ethnicity.\n\nThe \u201cgovernment of Abadi bears the main responsibility for triggering war on the Kurdistan people, and will be made to pay a heavy price\u201d, the Peshmerga command said in a statement, cited by Kurdish leader Barzani\u2019s assistant Hemin Hawrami.\n\nSECESSION OPPOSED BY NEIGHBORS\n\nThe Kurdish secession bid was strongly opposed by neighbors Iran and Turkey. Washington, allied with the Kurds for decades, pleaded vainly for them to halt a vote that could break up Iraq.\n\nThere were signs of internal strife among the Kurds, who have been divided for decades into two main factions, the KDP of regional government leader Barzani and the PUK of his longtime rival Jalal Talabani, who served as Iraq\u2019s ceremonial president in Baghdad from 2003-2014 and died two weeks ago.\n\nBoth Kurdish parties control their own Peshmerga units. While Barzani\u2019s KDP strongly supported the independence referendum, some PUK figures were more circumspect.\n\nMonday\u2019s Peshmerga statement accused a group within the PUK of \u201ctreason\u201d for allegedly assisting Baghdad\u2019s advance. \u201cWe regret that some PUK officials helped in this plot,\u201d it said.\n\nTalabani\u2019s widow, Hero, said the Iraqi operation was carried out with international consent and the PUK was not able to prevent it through talks. \u201cThis heroic city was facing an international plan,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe past few days have been spent in meetings with American representatives, representatives of the Iraqi government and ... of various other countries in order to prevent today\u2019s attack. \u201cIt is with great regret that we were not successful on this occasion.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nAlthough Iraqi officials portrayed the Kurds as retreating without a fight, Kurdish officials said Peshmerga had clashed with the \u201cPopular Mobilisation\u201d - Shi\u2019ite Muslim forces trained and armed by Iran that operate alongside regular Iraqi troops.\n\nTurkey, which had developed a good working relationship with the Iraqi Kurds and let the landlocked region export oil through its pipes, has swung behind Baghdad, furious at a secession move that might ignite similar demands from its own Kurds.\n\nTurkey said on Monday it would close its air space to KRG territory and work to hand control of the main border crossing into the region to the Iraqi central government.", "description": "Iraqi government forces captured the major Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk on Monday, responding to a Kurdish referendum on independence with a bold lightning strike that transforms the balance of power in the country.", "authors": ["Maher Chmaytelli", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171017&t=2&i=1205805428&w=1200&r=LYNXMPED9G0EQ", "published_at": "2017-10-17"}
