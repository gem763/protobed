More recently, the Navy conceived of the Littoral Combat Ship as a small fighting vessel, but in development the type grew to the size of a frigate and shed much of its weaponry.\n\nSmith advised the Navy to try again. \u201cThe solution to the naval littoral problem is merging sea-basing with the Navy\u2019s World War II and Cold War fast-attack concepts.\u201d\n\nOlder dock landing ships, such as the USS Whidbey Island (LSD-41) class, have a large well-deck designed for transporting Marine connectors (landing craft air cushioned [LCACs] and landing craft utility [LCUs]). Instead of connectors, why not load dock landing ships with two Skjold-class missile corvettes (currently used by the Norwegian navy) or similar boats. One of the fastest naval platforms afloat, the Skjold can do 60 knots, carries eight Naval Strike Missiles (a weapon coming to the U.S. inventory), a 76-millimeter OTO Melara cannon (also familiar to the U.S. Navy) and a crew of 20 or fewer. Loaded with fuel and missiles for rearming, a corvette carrier could rapidly deploy two stealthy corvettes such as the Skjold with an 800-nautical-mile range, capable of threatening an adversary surface fleet or naval base with a barrage of surface-to-surface missiles. Taking this concept further, the Navy could use existing expeditionary sea base ships (the Lewis B. Puller [ESB-3] class and the Montford Point [T-ESD-1] class) to carry four to five missile corvettes into a theater of its choosing, providing the potential for swarming fast-attack ships\u2014and posing a new problem to adversaries in their home waters.\n\nA flotilla of missile corvettes with their support ships could fit into the U.S. defense establishment\u2019s evolving concept for defending against a Chinese sneak attack targeting U.S. allies in the western Pacific.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military has a problem in the western Pacific: the tyranny of distance and time,\u201d analysts Thomas Mahnken, Travis Sharp, Billy Fabian and Peter Kouretsos, explained in a new study \u201cTightening the Chain: Implementing a Strategy of Maritime Pressure in the Western Pacific\u201d for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the aftermath of a surprise Chinese attack, \u201cAmerican forces located outside the conflict area would have to penetrate China\u2019s anti-access/area-denial network to restore the status quo ante, a daunting proposition.\u201d\n\nChinese forces would be particularly numerous and capable along the \u201cfirst island chain\u201d that stretches from Japan to The Philippines.\n\nTo blunt China\u2019s advantage, Mahnken, Sharp, Fabian and Kouretsos recommend the Pentagon pursue \u201ca military strategy of maritime pressure, which includes a new inside-out defense operational concept.\u201d\n\nSome troops -- in particular, U.S. Army and Marine forces with mobile rocket launchers, supported by a few Navy ships and small contingents of U.S. Air Force warplanes -- would hunker down on and around islands near China, preparing to hit Chinese troops from inside China\u2019s own expanding lines.\n\nAs part of this concept, missile corvettes could sail close to islands in order to avoid detection on radar. After Chinese forces bypassed the islands, the small, fast warships would strike back with their missiles. Carrier vessels would re-arm, refuel and repair the corvettes.\n\n\u201cThe technology already exists and the cost is a fraction of new capital ships,\u201d Smith pointed out. \u201cGiven a dedicated strategy to get corvettes into theater quickly, the Navy could project a littoral capability worldwide.\u201d\n\n(This first appeared earlier in June 2019.)\n\nImage: Wikimedia.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Or North Korea?", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/h4K.nG53pFP3Mkrt9ZXkvw--~B/aD05NTg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/6adeffdf7f69650f2441fe4b624c8914", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
