The question becomes how extensive you want those tabs to be, as the range of things that can be monitored keeps expanding.\n\nFor the safety conscious parent looking to buy a baby monitor, it\u2019s easy to experience mission creep. At first you might be with your newborn all the time, so have no need for a monitor. At some point you find yourself out of easy earshot of your baby, chatting with friends or watching a film, and you realise that a monitor would be a useful thing to have. An audio monitor does the trick, you think, as all you need to know is whether or not your baby is awake and crying.\n\nSo you start searching for the best baby monitor on the market, and suddenly you\u2019re looking at video monitors, which allow you to study your baby\u2019s visual cues. Is your baby rubbing their eyes and likely to fall asleep again at any moment? Or is your baby crying because they\u2019re uncomfortable and need rescuing? Now that you\u2019ve started to consider video cameras, you find yourself asking: is a static camera good enough? What about when your baby rolls out of frame \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be great to pan the camera around to get a better view of their face? Or follow them around the room once they\u2019re old enough to climb out of the cot.", "description": "Baby monitors allow you to keep tabs on your little one when you\u2019re not in the same room.", "authors": ["Nicola Cutcher"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/recommended/2019/05/10/Best_baby-monitors_summary-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
