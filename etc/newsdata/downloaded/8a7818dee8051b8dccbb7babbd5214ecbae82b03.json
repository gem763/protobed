I\u2019d rather spend my extra time writing books than reviewing them. But when the Book Review editors asked me to review Samantha Power\u2019s \u201cThe Education of an Idealist: A Memoir,\u201d I said yes, without hesitation. It wasn\u2019t because I suddenly had time on my hands. And it certainly wasn\u2019t because Power is a friend. I\u2019ve met her only once \u2014 in her last week as Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. No, it was because I knew only one thing about Power \u2014 from afar. She was a table-pounding idealist and human rights advocate, and believed in using American power to protect innocent civilians and advance democracy. And lately I have struggled with that position.\n\nHaving been a foreign correspondent in London, in Beirut during its civil war, in Israel and then the foreign affairs columnist for this newspaper since 1995, I\u2019d long wrestled with how much idealism one should allow oneself when advocating for or against the uses of American power abroad. I began reporting from the Middle East in 1979 with a lot of Minnesota optimism in my DNA. Alas, idealism is now a recessive gene in me after so many crushed hopes and covering one-too-many massacres. I am much more wary today \u2014 not isolationist, but wary \u2014 about what well-intentioned outsiders can do to sustainably reshape another country or region.\n\nGeorge W. Bush was right on one thing about the Iraq war \u2014 many Iraqis wanted to be free to be more democratic once the tyranny of Saddam Hussein was lifted from their necks. But many other Iraqis wanted to be free to be more Shiite, more Sunni Jihadist, more corrupt or just more powerful than the tribe or sect next door. No, Toto, everywhere is not like Kansas.\n\nThe only Arab Spring country that was able to make the transition (albeit still tentative) from dictatorship to democracy, and to power-sharing between Islamists and secularists, was Tunisia \u2014 the one Arab country America had nothing to do with. Think about that. And Burma\u2019s Aung San Suu Kyi showed how even a Nobel Peace Prize can\u2019t guarantee that today\u2019s human rights heroine won\u2019t become tomorrow\u2019s victimizer. Yet Obama\u2019s intervention in West Africa to stem the spread of Ebola \u2014 maybe his most significant foreign policy achievement, for which he got little credit precisely because it worked \u2014 demonstrated that without America as quarterback, important things that save lives and advance freedom at reasonable costs often don\u2019t happen.", "description": "\u201cThe Education of an Idealist,\u201d by Samantha Power, describes how her years with the Obama administration forced her to alter her thinking on foreign policy.", "authors": ["Thomas L.
