In theory, computational tasks could be carried out exponentially faster by quantum computers than by traditional computers. This is known as \u201cquantum supremacy.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s scientists said a 54-qubit (quantum bit) processor named Sycamore performed a target computation in 200 seconds, while the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer would take 10,000 years to produce a similar output.\n\nIBM, which is also working on quantum-computing research, cast doubt on Google\u2019s findings, saying that quantum supremacy \u201chas not been met.\u201d\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nGoogle scientists said they made a breakthrough in one of the most cutting-edge areas of computing, publishing a paper that demonstrates how much faster quantum computers could be than today\u2019s computers.\n\nIn the paper, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, the scientists said an experimental quantum processor they developed took seconds to carry out a computation that would take the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer thousands of years. This is known as \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d and it would mark a major breakthrough in the experimental field.\n\nQuantum computing is complex and very much at the research stage. It involves computing technology based on the principles of quantum theory.\n\nInstead of bits, which today\u2019s computers use to process information, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits. Where classical computers are constrained by how fast they can switch between outputting zeros and ones, quantum computers would face no such constraints, because qubits theoretically can exist in both states simultaneously.\n\nThe upshot is that quantum computers would be able to carry out particular tasks exponentially faster \u2013 millions of times as fast as a standard computer. Google said this is what it demonstrated.\n\nJohn Martinis and Sergio Boixo, two senior scientists at Google AI Quantum, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday that they were motivated to run the experiment to find out whether quantum computing would \u201cever do something useful\u201d and was \u201cworth investing in.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor such large-scale endeavors it is good engineering practice to formulate decisive short-term goals that demonstrate whether the designs are going in the right direction,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSo, we devised an experiment as an important milestone to help answer these questions.\u201d\n\nThe scientists\u2019 experiment involved building a 54-qubit processor, named Sycamore, made up of \u201cfast, high-fidelity quantum logic gates.\u201d\n\nRead more: Quantum computing could change everything, and IBM is racing with Microsoft, Intel, and Google to conquer it. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nThey then tested Sycamore\u2019s computing ability and how long it would take to perform one target calculation. Setting the bar for success high, the scientists agreed on \u201ca sensitive computational benchmark that fails if just a single component of the computer is not good enough,\u201d Martinis and Boixo said.\n\nThe scientists said Sycamore performed the target calculation in 200 seconds, while it would take the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to produce a similar output.\n\ncaption An IBM quantum-computing researcher.

Knight briefly touched on one area: data security. He said that while any threat posed by quantum computing to processes such as encryption was distant, it was still there.\n\nFor its part, IBM disputed Google\u2019s breakthrough, saying in a blog post on Monday that quantum supremacy \u201chas not been met.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Google said it had realized \"quantum supremacy\" after running an experiment to test the power of quantum computers..
