After four years abroad as Australia's High Commissioner in Britain, Downer was unimpressed at the calibre of political debate he encountered upon his return in May. Australia's longest-serving foreign minister and a linchpin of the nation's last stable government under John Howard, Downer reasoned that people didn't have enough to worry about.\n\n\"One of the things that is very striking about Australia, looking at Australia from the outside, is the constant discussion about the next election and opinion polls,\" he said. \"That's because there isn't enough to talk about. There aren't enough huge issues.\"\n\nDowner said it was clear to him that \"people here are, relative to the rest of the world, living in pretty much a paradise. That's not to say Australia doesn't have its problems. But it is working incredibly well. And so the public don't kind of know what they want.\"\n\nDowner could have been prophesising about his own political party, instead of the public. Because when the Coalition government decapitated itself for reasons which remain unexplained by the perpetrators, other than ideology and ambition, it looked like it had nothing better to do. A popular leader who had pulled the Coalition into a position where it was statistically even with the opposition in the polls, and whose government was riding a booming economy and a recovering budget, was necked.\n\nBill & Mary from Penrith\n\nUnderscoring the febrile nature of politics, just weeks ahead of the attempted coup the general mood of our power panel was still favourable towards Turnbull and his government, despite the Longman result. The improving economy was filtering through the electorate, providing a fillip to those with the power of incumbency.\n\nWhen the panel met for last year's power issue, there was significant discussion whether to include on the covert list a stereotypical \"outer-suburban couple fed up with flatlining wages, soaring living costs and who were itching to throw a grenade into the political establishment\". For argument's sake, they were called Bill and Mary from Penrith, and they represented the disgruntled who were disrupting political power by opting for minor parties and forcing the major parties into a populist race to the bottom. They are the Australian relatives of Americans who voted for Trump and Britons who elected to leave the EU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year, they barely got a mention. Tony Mitchelmore, one of the nation's leading qualitative and quantitative researchers who identified Bill and Mary last year, said while they were still miffed, their lot had improved. \"The biggest change from last year is sentiment in the country,\" he said, adding that the country was a \"slightly happier one\". Among the mainstream there was a greater confidence in the future, driven by a confidence in the economy. \"All our research, both qualitative and quantitative, shows that confidence in the future kind of crossed over about October, November last year. And it keeps on going up.\"\n\nMitchelmore didn't want to overstate it but he attributed the improvement in the Liberal Party's poll numbers over the same period to that change in sentiment and concluded that Turnbull needed to ride it.\n\nNot now.\n\nOvert power declared, transparent\n\nThe upheaval in Canberra in late August forced a complete reassessment and revision of our power lists. Ever since the first AFR Magazine Power issue in 2001, overt power has been defined as the kind which is gained and maintained as a consequence of position or wealth. It is declared, open and transparent, and it is largely vested in the position, not the person.\n\nHence Turnbull is gone, from the government and as number one on the list of the nation's most powerful. The radical change in his circumstances, from the centre of power to political exile means he drops out of the list and is instead given a special mention on account of the Power issue's backward, as well as forward-looking, perspective. He is replaced by Scott Morrison, who soars from seventh last year to the top spot by virtue of his role, even if he is yet to assert his authority.\n\nEven before the spill, the panel voted to elevate Morrison to fourth spot on the 2018 list. Mitchelmore now says that given public expectations of Morrison as prime minister are so low, \"at least he has the potential to exceed them\". It's faint praise. This time next year he will be either relegated or gone unless he can win the election due by May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudging by the views of the panel, if not the wider public, if politicians were not automatically endowed with power, few, if any, would qualify. Power requires trust and there is precious little left of that in the ruling classes. \"The relationship between trust and power is so critical \u2013 you don't have trust, you don't have power \u2013 and that's what we're seeing,\" says panellist and AGL executive Skye Laris.\n\nNo business leaders on list\n\nIn this vein, significant by omission for the second year running is anyone from business. The spectacle of the most egregious sins of the financial services industry being exposed each day by the banking royal commission has tarred the entire business sector.\n\nBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott is shortlisted but then dismissed when panellists decide that the big business lobby group is either outgunned by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) or lacks resolve to campaign as strongly as is needed to cut through. Qantas boss Alan Joyce warrants more discussion, as much because of his high-profile role in the same-sex marriage debate as his successful stewardship of a major airline and advocacy of business tax cuts. He fails narrowly to make the cut.\n\nDavid Gonski, a perennial holder of covert power, falls off that list, his influence weakened by his public support for AMP chairman Catherine Brenner ahead of her resignation over revelations at the banking royal commission.\n\nThe consequences of the loss of trust and power in the mainstream are ever present. \"We're still in an age of populism and in an age of populism good policy rarely makes good politics and it's the tension between what would rationally be sensible policy and the demands and expectations of the community,\" says Dennis Richardson, a former secretary of the departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade. \"Even when government performs and makes policies, which by any objective standard are quite reasonable, it is discounted.\"\n\nMalcolm Turnbull being photographed at Parliament House in Canberra for the AFR Magazine Power list just days before he was deposed as prime minister. Dominic Lorrimer\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolicy sidetracked by politics\n\nRichardson's lament is common of a situation where the community wants simple solutions to complex problems. When the major parties cannot provide them, voters drift towards the populists. This in turn erodes the power of the major parties and undermines their ability to govern, which further undermines their power.\n\nThe conundrum is best summed up by Group of Eight chief executive Vicki Thomson, a former senior political adviser and journalist. \"There's a level of frustration among the mainstream that we seem to capitulate to the fringe, and then nothing happens, so policy doesn't get through. Then the punters are frustrated because they don't think that their government or opposition are delivering, so then they vote for an independent,\" she says.\n\n\"We have this self-fulfilling prophecy, which makes it very difficult for good policy. We've had many examples of good policy which goes astray, or is amended, or is changed, to the point that it's diluted, and then the mainstream are frustrated, and so are the fringe element.\"\n\nWitness the National Energy Guarantee, an insipid, third-best last chance to achieve bipartisan consensus and end the debilitating climate and energy policy wars. Ahead of the leadership change, Richardson had called it \"a genuine attempt to try to get it right and define the middle ground\" and \"if it fails, it will fail because of the politics of it, not because of the merits of it\".\n\nEnergy policy neutered by populism\n\nBut fail it did, and as a consequence, NEG architects Kerry Schott and John Pierce are booted off the panel's original covert list and replaced by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims. This neatly encapsulates the stampede towards populism and the end of any prospect for a bipartisan energy policy that includes emissions reduction.\n\nWhen the NEG died, all that was left was a range of direct intervention measures recommended by the ACCC to force down prices. Turnbull was going to implement them alongside the NEG. Morrison has shifted the focus to that of price only. Sims' report is the blueprint, although he is not a supporter of forced divestment, which the government has also adopted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichardson reasons that the era of populism will end because \"populism has an energy which ultimately wears itself out\". But when? Energy policy is just one example of the race to the bottom. The government's inability to secure support for its company tax cuts is a key symptom of the loss of trust in business. Giving big business a tax cut has proven to be an easy policy to argue against politically.\n\nAmong those dancing on the NEG's grave were Alan Jones, Ray Hadley and commentators on Sky. Their role in dispatching Turnbull lifts them into third spot on the covert power list. While they operate in public, the source of their real power is their influence over Coalition backbenchers. Joining them is perennial power player, Rupert Murdoch. Turnbull was so convinced that Murdoch was actively conspiring to bring him down that he rang the media baron two days before the leadership spill urging him to back off. Those familiar with Murdoch know that he doesn't need to issue explicit instructions to his editors to get his way. Says Downer: \"His executives, and I see this in England as well, his executives defer to him. They live in fear.\"\n\nAFR Magazine's annual Power issue.\n\nCovert power not transparent\n\nCovert power, by its nature, is hard to perceive. After the coup, Lucy Turnbull and Sally Cray (Malcolm Turnbull's principal private secretary) vanish from the list. Into Lucy's place as number one goes Philip Gaetjens, who has worked for Morrison as his chief of staff and in July was appointed as secretary of the Treasury. The search for the incoming PM's \u00e9minence grise, a trusted confidant, leads the panel towards a small group of Morrison's friends and MPs: David Gazard, Stuart Robert, Alex Hawke, Ben Morton and Scott Briggs.\n\nNot on the list is Morrison's chief of staff, John Kunkel, although Loughnane thinks this is an omission. \"John was an experienced and respected Coalition staffer in the Howard years,\" Loughnane says. \"Since then he has had a number of senior private sector jobs which have added to his experience. He therefore brings a great mix to the job of chief of staff.\"\n\nEven before the leadership spill, new entrants on the overt list reflected the upheaval in the national power balance. High Court Chief Justice Susan Kiefel was a significant addition \u2013 the first time the Chief Justice had appeared since 2012, which was when her predecessor, Robert French, oversaw decisions that stymied the Gillard government, including ending the proposed Malaysian solution to resettling refugees. The High Court's black letter interpretation of section 44 of the Constitution \u2013 which sent packing a bevy of MPs, Senators and their flimsy excuses and legal advice, resulting in byelections and massive disruption \u2013 was a strong reaffirmation of the separation of powers.\n\n\"If you look at the dynamics of the Australian political system over the past 12 months, those High Court decisions had a huge impact,\" says panellist and former Labor minister Martin Ferguson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowner concurs: \"Just because the High Court doesn't appear in the media every day \u2026 doesn't mean it isn't a hugely powerful institution. It is one of the three great institutions in this country: the executive, the legislature and the judiciary.\"\n\nRoyal commission impact\n\nSimilarly, the take-no-prisoners approach of banking royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne earns him a listing, and not just because of the impact his findings will have on the financial sector. \"The royal commission has had impacts way beyond just banking in both business and politics,\" says Loughnane. \"I think business is now very much trying to second-guess reputation, behaviour, whatever.\"\n\nExacerbating the power shift away from mainstream institutions is the proliferation of social media. Facebook and fake news play a big role in destroying trust, with experts, for example, being challenged and attacked by non-experts, be it on climate change or tax reform or education.\n\n\"It has become much more common to hear people say, 'Well, you don't really know though, do you?',\" says Laris, who before taking her role at AGL was Labor's first national digital campaigns director. Thomson says universities are not exempt from the \"mistrust seeping into all of our institutions. People don't want to hear from academics. They don't want to hear from experts. They don't trust them.\"\n\nNumber one spot on the covert power list goes to Philip Gaetjens, who has worked for Morrison as his chief of staff and in July was appointed as secretary of the Treasury. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nBill Shorten is number two on the list for the second consecutive year. Loughnane likens the Labor leader to Hillary Clinton, in that the election is now his to lose, whereas Laris says Shorten must be taken more seriously because his prospects of being in The Lodge next year have improved. Mitchelmore concurs: \"The odds of him being the next PM just got shorter,\" he says, referring to the leadership change. \"He is looking more powerful now, in the box seat.\"\n\nSimilarly, new Treasurer and deputy leader Josh Frydenberg enters the list at number three, by virtue of his titles. It was not his fault the NEG failed. But he is on probation, his influence yet to be proven.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for those behind the bungled spill? Cormann and Dutton stay on the list although lower than where they would have been were Turnbull still prime minister. Morrison still needs Cormann in the Senate, even if there are no more signature pieces of legislation to put before the next election. As for Dutton, he's in seventh spot, ahead of Tony Abbott in ninth.\n\nThe AFR Magazine Power issue is out on Friday October 5 inside The Australian Financial Review.\n\nFollow AFR Mag on Twitter and Instagram", "description": "The Liberals\u2019 leadership upheaval became the dramatic backdrop to the compilation of this year\u2019s AFR Magazine Power issue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1.6736%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_478%2C$x_222%2C$y_36/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f37e1d64a9d766528015d43b85ba15590188d017", "published_at": "2018-08-14"}
