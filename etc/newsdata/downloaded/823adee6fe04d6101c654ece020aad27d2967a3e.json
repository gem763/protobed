He just doesn't feel it, doesn't care'.\n\n'This wasn't for attention,' added Ajay Alexander. 'It was for the power, control and domination that he enjoyed.'\n\nIn a criminal complaint filed in January, Special Agent Cameron McDowell said Fleury showed no remorse when questioned and admitted to a fascination with the tragic event leading to his decision to 'troll' those affected.\n\nInvestigators said he 'admitted to targeting family members who were \"activists\" who had a large social media presence,' in his vulgar messages sent over a several weeks.\n\nFleury's defenders argued his autism created reasonable doubt regarding his capacity to understand the emotional impact of his messages (Pictured: a memorial outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School)\n\nThe family and best friend of victim Jaime Guttenberg, 14, were some of those he used to 'gain popularity'.\n\nFleury is said to have used Instagram's tagging feature to mention the handles of the victim's brother and friend to alert them to his sick comments.\n\n'I took a s**t on your sister's grave,' a message to Guttenberg's brother written alongside the crying of laughter emoji, applause emoji and three poop emojis, allegedly read.\n\nIt was also said Fleury wrote 'Did you like my Valentines gift? I killed your friends' about the February shooting, and tagged the victim's best friend.\n\n@nik.taunts_ wrote about the weapon Cruz used, 'I stole your sister's future, buddy, with the power of my AR-15'\n\nOn Christmas Eve, @bullseyetauntsyou._ wrote: 'You'll never see Jaime again, little orphan.

Dead huh?' and @nik.taunts_ wrote about the weapon Cruz used: 'I stole your sister's future, buddy, with the power of my AR-15.'\n\nHe is believed to have tried to contact Jaime's father, Fred Guttenberg, an anti-gun-violence activist who has approximately 152,000 Twitter followers, but mentioned the wrong handle.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Fleury took on the persona of Ted Bundy, claiming to have killed Janice Ott and Denise Naslund in 1974 from the @teddykillspeople account where he wrote: 'I'm your abductor. I'm kidnapping you fool.'\n\nThe father of victim Alex Schachter, Max Schachter, was also targeted. The school safety advocate who had expressed interest in running for governor in December, received a message from @nikolasthemurderer on New Year's Eve about how his son 'will never play music again'.\n\nThe taunts, which began on December 22 last year, were traced to an IP address in Santa Ana, where Fleury lives with his father and brother.\n\nHe faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and will be sentenced on December 2.\n\nOn Christmas Day Fleury took on the persona of killer Theodore 'Ted' Bundy", "description": "Brandon Fleury, 22, from Santa Ana, was found guilty of interstate cyberstalking and interstate transmission of threat to kidnap at\u00a0Fort Lauderdale federal court on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/11/19486290-0-image-a-16_1570617728725.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
