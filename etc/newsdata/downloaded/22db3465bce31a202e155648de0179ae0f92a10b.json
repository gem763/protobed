I was kept in hospital until they diagnosed me after I was sent for a scan.\n\n\"It has been pretty hard, especially my girlfriend having a house to run, kids to sort, newborn baby and visiting me. We have decided to try to make something good out of this and get married.\"\n\nHe hopes the wedding will give the family something to look forward to and to focus on in the coming months.\n\nPosting on their fundraising page, Darren said: \"We are basically asking if any friends and family would like to help donate so I can try make this day the special day this amazing woman deserves.\"\n\nTo donate to their gofundme page click here .", "description": "Darren Watson, from Hull, is crowdfunding to give his partner Claire Larter 'a very special wedding she deserves' after doctors found a large lymphoma in his chest", "authors": ["Tom Kershaw", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Hull Daily Mail", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20717504.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS196607258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
