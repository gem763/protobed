So here\u2019s a little video of me singing one of her favorite songs (American girl by Tom petty) in one of her favorite places (her bathtub, of course),\" Lourd wrote. \"I\u2019ll probably have a pint of vanilla Haggen Dazs and a Coca Cola for dinner.\"\n\nLourd, 27, whose father is Fisher's former partner, talent agent Bryan Lourd, has honored her mother several times since Fisher's death. Last December, she shared a video of herself singing Jackson Browne's \"These Days,\" along with a note explaining how \"vulnerable\" it made her feel. Singing with Fisher, whom she called \"Momby,\" was a favorite past time.\n\nMario Anzuoni/Reuters, FILE\n\n\"I\u2019ve found that what keeps me moving is doing things that make me happy, working hard on the things that I\u2019m passionate about and surrounding myself with people I love and making them smile,\" she wrote. \"I hope this encourages anyone feeling a little low or lost to 'keep on moving.' As my Momby once said, 'Take your broken heart and turn it into art; - whatever that art may be for you.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
