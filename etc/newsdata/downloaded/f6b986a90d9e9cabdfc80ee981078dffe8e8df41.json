Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) suggested Thursday at a town hall meeting in Queens, New York, that the U.S. should develop \u201czero-carbon airplanes\u201d as part of a push to solve the problem of climate change.\n\nAfter answering a question about a proposed monorail to deal with climate change, she declared:\n\nWhen it comes to the Green New Deal, people are, like \u2014 and of course, they come from this zero-sum mentality: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take away your hamburgers. We\u2019re going to take away your airplanes. We\u2019re going to take away all of these things.\u201d And really, what this is asking us is what are we going to make, not what are we going to take away \u2014 what are we going to establish. And, frankly, for everyone who says a Green New Deal is going to ground planes, I guarantee you, climate change \u2014 which threatens storms, turbulence, airplane groundings, and airport closures \u2014 will ground airplanes far sooner and far worse than any sort of climate legislation ever would if we made, for example, scientific investments in zero-carbon airplanes and flights and things like that, which, I believe, at some point, you know, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to create that kind of technology. But it takes thinking like this to do it. So, thank you.\n\nLast week, Forbes described the current state of engineering regarding \u201czero-emission airplanes.\u201d Currently, there are small, battery-operated aircraft that are capable of making short trips. Airbus plans to introduce a prototype of a commercial-size hybrid aircraft in 2021 that uses three traditional jet fuel engines and one electric one, though the design is not expected to be in commercial use for two decades \u2014 far beyond the Green New Deal\u2019s 12-year horizon.\n\nForbes concluded: \u201cMany experts predict that electric planes could be relatively commonplace within 20 years. However, they will likely be small planes that can hold around 100 passengers and will fly mostly between regional airports.\u201d\n\nThere is no feasible solution \u2014 yet \u2014 for long-distance commercial flight involving large numbers of passengers or significant cargo loads that does not involve the use of jet fuel.\n\nIn 2016, the Solar Impulse 2 (above), a solar-powered aircraft, circumnavigated the globe \u2014 but the journey took more than four months and the aircraft could only fly in good weather. In addition, it only weighed about 2 tons.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s suggestion (via the Washington Free Beacon) came at the same town hall meeting at which she was urged by a prankster to adopt a new campaign slogan, \u201cEat the Babies,\u201d to convey the urgency of climate change, which could end the world in the near future.\n\nThe prank took in many observers \u2014 including Ocasio-Cortez herself \u2014 partly because the proposal resembles some of the more creative ideas that the representative has proposed to deal with the problem of climate change. In the past, for example, Ocasio-Cortez has said that she planned to have \u201cone less child\u201d for fear of the impacts of climate change. (A fringe group, LaRouche PAC, later claimed credit for the \u201ceat the babies\u201d prank.)\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
