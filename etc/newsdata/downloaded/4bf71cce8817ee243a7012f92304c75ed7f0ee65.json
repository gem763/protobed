They have been placed into a complicated and unprecedented situation while abroad and we believe it would be unfair to ask them to address these matters in real time,\u201d the league said in a statement on Friday.\n\nOn Thursday, a reporter questioning Houston Rockets players about the league's commitment to promoting social justice and how it squares with its business dealings with China, where pro-democracy protesters are being violently repressed in Hong Kong and ethnic minorities have been detained in the country's west. In a now-viral encounter, an NBA minder shut down the reporter's question. The NBA has since apologized for the incident.\n\nThis followed Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeting a show of support for the Hong Kong protesters, which he quickly took down and apologized for under league pressure. U.S. politicians hailed the apology as shameful and evidence of U.S. companies bowing to Chinese pressure.\n\nIn the U.S., security at NBA preseason games has confiscated and destroyed signs from fans that question China's human rights practices.\n\nIn China, many fans have shown anger and resentment toward the NBA for questioning the legitimacy of China's practices. China said that questioning its treatment of Hong Kong protesters fell outside the bounds of free speech.\n\nChina represents a $4 billion opportunity for the NBA, which enjoyed massive popularity in the country before Morey's tweet.", "description": "China represents a $4 billion opportunity for the NBA.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/James-harden-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
