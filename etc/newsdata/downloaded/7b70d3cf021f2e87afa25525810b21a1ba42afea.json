Hong Kong's Hang Seng was an outlier, slipping 0.1%.\n\nThe offshore yuan was up 0.4% against the U.S. dollar. The yuan's relative weakness has been a source of tension between the countries in recent weeks, with the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation after a sharp depreciation in the yuan.\n\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.1%, reversing earlier gains after a German economic institute said a recession is likely in the continent's largest economy.\n\nInvestors were focused on the European Central Bank's policy decision due later Thursday, where expectations were high for a stimulus package. Analysts anticipate an interest-rate cut of at least a 10 basis points to its key deposit rate. The policy statement is due at 1:45 p.m. in Frankfurt.\n\n\"The ECB is running out of options to counter the gloom,\" said Robert McAdie, chief cross-asset strategist at BNP Paribas.\n\nThere was \"some degree of dissent\" between decision makers at the ECB about how to press ahead with measures, said David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies, making it difficult to predict a likely outcome.\n\n\"The slowdown in the eurozone is not about domestic forces but global trade more generally,\" Mr. Owen said.\n\nOther efforts from the ECB to support growth may include measures to cushion banks from the impact of negative interest rates, which can put pressure on profits. Many investors were also predicting a return to quantitative easing, by way of restarting the ECB's asset-purchase program.\n\nGovernment bond yields, which had climbed in recent days, were down across the board in Europe. Germany's 10-year bund fell to minus 0.579%.\n\nThe U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 1.725%, from 1.733% on Wednesday, after posting three straight days of gains. Bond prices fall as yields rise.\n\nInflation data from the U.S., expected later Thursday, could have an impact on Federal Reserve decision makers ahead of their meeting next week. Recent updates to the consumer-price index from the Labor Department suggested inflation might be making a comeback.\n\nWith strong wage growth reported last month, prices may continue to rebound after a weak start to the year. Excluding volatile sectors like fuel and food, so-called core CPI should have risen 0.2% in August, economists expect.\n\nFigures will also be released on the number of weekly U.S. jobless claims, with an expectation of 216,000, nearly level from last week's 217,000.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude rose 0.6% to $61.09 a barrel. Gold was flat, after its price climbed following Mr. Trump's call for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates to zero. Lower interest rates tend to support the price of the haven metal by making it more competitive with yield-bearing assets like bonds.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 12, 2019 05:34 ET (09:34 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
