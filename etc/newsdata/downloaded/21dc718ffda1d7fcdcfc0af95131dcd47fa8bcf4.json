In same interview, Ozil admitted that he and Arsenal\u2019s manager do not always see eye-to-eye.\n\nEmery praised Ozil ahead of Arsenal\u2019s trip to Sheffield United (Picture: Getty)\n\nDespite their differences, Emery singled Ozil out for praise ahead of Arsenal\u2019s trip to Bramall Lane on Monday evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am speaking every day with Raul [Sanllehi], Edu and with the players,\u2019 the Spaniard said.\n\n\u2018Our work is more important than our words and really now I am very happy at the club.\n\n\u2018I am really happy with the players. The last two, three, four weeks, every player \u2013 and Mesut Ozil \u2013 is working very well.\n\n\u2018This is why we can be positive and we can think we are going to do something important this year.\n\n\u2018I was speaking with Raul and this is the same idea when he is speaking with me.\u2019\n\nEmery reserved special praise for Ozil before the Bramall Lane clash (Picture: Getty)\n\nArsenal legend Martin Keown believes Ozil \u2018needs to look at himself\u2019 over his \u2019embarrassing\u2019 situation in north London.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s embarrassing for the football club that he is not featuring for Arsenal,\u2019 the former defender told talkSPORT.\n\n\u2018He has to take a look at himself. It can\u2019t be everybody else\u2019s fault.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t care what he\u2019s earning to play for the club it\u2019s an honour to play and while you are there you make your mark.\n\n\u2018At the moment is he setting a good example in training? As a senior player I would make sure that the youngsters would follow on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would graft, I would work, give everything I could. I would be collective and help the group around me.\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be talking about me. He\u2019s looking about and saying I\u2019m not playing now so don\u2019t blame me.\n\n\u2018Well, no! It\u2019s about the collective it\u2019s not about you. How do we get you in the team now to get you back in the group. That\u2019s the next step for Ozil now. The opportunity is there.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t see him saying anywhere he is desperate to play. For me, the oxygen every weekend was to be in that team and I would bust a gut and I want to see that from Ozil.\u2019\n\nMORE: England star Jonny Bairstow reacts after his Hundred team sign Ashes rivals Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc", "description": "Unai Emery has praised Mesut Ozil ahead of Arsenal's clash with Sheffield United, and claims his whole squad, without exception, have impressed him in recent weeks.
