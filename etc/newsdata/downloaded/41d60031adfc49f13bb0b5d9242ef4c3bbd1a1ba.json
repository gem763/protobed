If the person lives with you, absolutely. If you\u2019re having some friends over, though, is this overkill? Do you have a responsibility to let people know, or are you making a mountain out of a (smart) molehill?\n\nHaving just acquired a Google Nest Hub Max, I have my own thoughts on this. But first let\u2019s hear from Google\u2019s own Rick Osterloh \u2014 senior vice president of devices and services, and the guy who who basically ran last week\u2019s Made by Google event, if you recall.\n\nIn a recent interview, Osterloh had a somewhat surprising admission about device transparency. Surprising not because he was wrong, but because you might not expect the guy sitting on a mountain of hardware \u2014 at Google, no less \u2014 to share such a concern in a public form. As he told the BBC:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite important for all these technologies to think about all users... we have to consider all stakeholders that might be in proximity. Does the owner of a home need to disclose to a guest? I would and do when someone enters into my home, and it\u2019s probably something that the products themselves should try to indicate.\u201d\n\nI would absolutely love to hear your thoughts on this in the comments. To get the conversation started, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking based on my own life experience of using a variety of connected devices \u2014 speakers, cameras, whatever \u2014 in the house I share with my roommates.\n\nGenerally speaking, I think it\u2019s a bit overkill to announce to guests that you own or use a smart speaker. These devices don\u2019t listen to you unless you utter whatever specific wake word it is you use. After that, recordings can happen, sure, but I think most people at a social gathering or a party aren\u2019t going to spill their innermost secrets just because someone (or someone on the TV) accidentally said \u201cAlexa\u201d or \u201cHey Google.\u201d\n\nIf anything, I\u2019d be more afraid that your friends or party guests use your smart speaker to fuck around with you than accidentally reveal their darkest thoughts, but that\u2019s just me. Sure, I suppose a truly evil geek (or company) could dial into their smart speakers in advance from another room and record everything that\u2019s said around these devices \u2014 assuming you\u2019ve hidden the smart speaker or people don\u2019t know what to look for when the speaker indicates it is recording something.\n\nThey could also drop a pinhole camera into the bathroom or something, too; at some point, you\u2019re going to have to rely on your own instincts (and a person\u2019s trustworthiness), and that\u2019s probably a lot more significant than having them announce that, yes, there\u2019s an Amazon Echo in their living room.\n\nThat all said, I do think you should have a basic idea of what devices look like when they\u2019re recording \u2014 green, for example, if someone has dialled into an Amazon Echo. To help you out with that, I do think someone should let you know if they have an always-on device like a Nest Cam or, in my case, a Google Nest Hub Max. People might not realise that your pretty smart display\u2019s tiny green light means that the camera is on and recording everything that happens in front of it. It might not be a \u201cthis device is powered on\u201d light.\n\nAt least, that was my situation when I recently set up a Google Nest Hub Max. And this isn\u2019t meant to criticise Google; the device does exactly what it\u2019s meant to, and my breezing through the setup process without much thought meant that my surprise was my fault. When I downloaded the associated Nest app and pulled it up to see just what my device\u2019s camera could do, I realise it had been recording, well, everything \u2014 from me sitting at my desk working, to me changing clothes for the day, to all the various times during the night when my desktop monitor accidentally flicked on and likely woke me up (which explains why I\u2019ve been sleeping poorly lately).\n\nAnyway, I should have known better, but that\u2019s my fault for setting up my device without really reading the fine print of what I was doing. What can I say; I was in a rush. However, I also would probably not have thought about this recording aspect at all were I visiting a friend\u2019s house and admiring the smart display in their kitchen, and I would absolutely know I would have a normal conversation around it without realising that its owner could pull up the footage later to see what I was talking about \u2014 if they were that weird about surveillance.\n\nSo I\u2019m with Osterloh on this one. If you have an always-on recording device in your home, you\u2019re a jerk if you don\u2019t let people know where it is and what it does. (And this is something you should remind people about regularly, as I doubt most are making a mental list in their heads of which friends have what devices and where.) If you\u2019re simply sporting a smart speaker, I think announcing its presence is less of a deal \u2014 overkill, really. But if a camera is recording me at any point, and that\u2019s something you can view later, I think it\u2019s the friendly thing to do to let me know before I start gossiping... or worse.", "description": "Should you ever tell someone that you\u2019ve stashed a smart speaker, camera, or display in your home somewhere?
