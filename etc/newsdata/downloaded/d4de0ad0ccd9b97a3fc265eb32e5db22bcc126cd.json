It\u2019s an effective metaphor, just not an accurate one.The history of repo shows that it\u2019s far from the stable system of financial pipes and more like a series of end-runs designed to circumvent government regulations and restrictions. Its latest woes may well be another installment in a decades-long story of regulatory arbitrage.\n\nThe standard definition of a repo, or repurchase agreement, is a sale of securities from a borrower to a creditor, with an agreement to repurchase them at a set date in the future for a specified price. It\u2019s akin to a loan, in that the repurchase price covers the original amount and a little more \u2013 a kind of \u201cinterest\u201d payment.\n\nIf the borrower fails to buy back the security, then the creditor can sell the security to satisfy the outstanding debt. A repo, then, is a bit like pawning a Treasury bond for cash. It\u2019s the same principle \u2013 up to a point. Unlike pawned jewelry, the bonds held by the creditor aren\u2019t held on a shelf until the repurchase date comes due; they can be sold or used to settle other repo agreements.\n\nRepurchase agreements remained exceedingly rare until World War I, when Congress passed a tax on financial instruments to defray the costs of the conflict. The levy hit banks hard: Every time a bank borrowed money from the Fed, it had to pay a tax.\n\nWhat to do? The Fed, eager to ensure the health of the banking sector, concluded that it could \u201cloan\u201d money to member banks using repos. It would buy bonds from banks, and the banks would buy them back, paying a little fee for the privilege. And while the Fed couldn\u2019t lend money to non-member banks, it set up repos with these banks, too.\n\nAt first glance it looks like a plumbing job connecting the Fed to banks for the sake of smoother operations. But it was, in point of fact, an end run around Congress and its ill-considered tax. The whole thing was pretty clever, if a bit underhanded -- prop up the demand for bonds when the government began borrowing at a staggering clip. Once the war was over, this particular set of plumbing was left to rust.\n\nAs the Great Depression reached its depth, the financial system was struggling with new rules and regulations issued during the New Deal. It would be only a matter of time until repo\u2019s triumphant return.\n\nMany reformers argued that banks during the 1920s had been reckless in their competition for deposit funds, offering interest rates that they could not realistically pay. In 1933, the Fed stepped in, issuing Regulation Q \u2013 a prohibition against banks paying interest on demand deposits.\n\nProblem solved? Well, not really. As the U.S. pulled out of deflation in the 1950s, interest rates began rising. This left many corporations and municipalities \u2013 all of which had to maintain significant amounts of cash to handle payrolls and other expenses \u2013 in a difficult position. If they deposited their cash, they earned nothing, thanks to Regulation Q.\n\nThen someone realized \u2013 it\u2019s not clear who \u2013 that repos supplied a solution. As early as 1956, the New York Times detailed the new practice, noting that larger corporations had effectively become pawn shops, buying up bonds from dealers for a day or more, then selling them back.\n\n\u201cThe parties to these transactions,\u201d the Times dryly noted, \u201cseem to be taking unusual steps to heed the injunction of Polonius to be neither a borrower nor a lender.\u201d But the real reason for this innovation, the paper made clear, was to circumvent the interest-rate ceiling on deposits.\n\nThe Times noted other advantages as well. Repo agreements were \u201cmade with a minimum of red tape.\u201d They enabled the corporations who lent the money to make more than they could have if they actually collected interest on governments bonds. At the same time, the dealers who pawned their bonds for cash got a better deal than if they borrowed money from banks. In circumventing Regulation Q, everyone was a winner.\n\nIn the following twenty years, repos took off, particularly once inflation began spiraling out of control. After 1969, outstanding repos totaled a mere $4.9 billion. A decade later, they had ballooned nearly tenfold, to $45 billion. Each time interest rates went up, repos became more and more popular.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The repo market is often described as the \u201cplumbing\u201d of the financial system, especially when it starts to look clogged and in need of the kind of flushing that only the Federal Reserve can provide.
