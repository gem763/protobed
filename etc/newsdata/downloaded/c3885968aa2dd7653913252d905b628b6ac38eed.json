Three things.\n\nFirst, and not least important, it would augment the public stock of useful information and harmless pleasure to make Senate Republicans stop silently squirming and start taking audible responsibility for the president whom they evidently think they exist to enable. Second, it would affirm Congress\u2019s primacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe have heard too many defensive assertions that Congress is \u201cco-equal\u201d with the executive and judicial branches. It is more than that. As the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Jay Cost notes, Congress is involved in the other branches\u2019 actions by determining the size and scope of the other branches. (All federal courts other than the Supreme Court, and every executive department and officer except the president and vice president, are Congress\u2019s creations.) And by confirming or rejecting nominees to executive and judicial positions. And by stipulating those nominees\u2019 salaries. And by overriding presidential vetoes. And by exercising the power \u2014 unused since June 4, 1942 \u2014 to declare war. And by ratifying or rejecting treaties, and shaping the military\u2019s size and mission. And by initiating constitutional amendments. As Cost says, the other branches are largely incapable of interfering with Congress, which sets its own pay and rules. Yet today\u2019s Republican-controlled Senate, Trump\u2019s sock puppet, will not consider legislation that he disapproves \u2014 as though the Senate expressing its own judgment about the public good would be l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9.\n\nThird, articles of impeachment might concern his general stonewalling of congressional inquiries. This obduracy vitiates Congress\u2019s role in the system of checks and balances, one purpose of which is to restrain rampant presidents. An impeachment proceeding could strengthen institutional muscles that Congress has allowed to atrophy.\n\nThese three benefits from impeachment would not be trivial. But even cumulatively, they probably are not worth the costs of impeachment \u2014 costs in time, energy and political distraction. This is so because, regardless of the evidence presented, there is approximately zero chance of an anti-Trump insurrection by 20 of his vigorously obedient Senate Republicans. So, a Senate trial might seem, to the attentive portion of the public, yet another episode of mere gesture politics, of which there currently is too much. And it would further inflame the president\u2019s combustible supporters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs this column has hitherto argued (May 31), impeachment can be retrospective, as punishment for offenses committed, and prospective, to prevent probable future injuries to society. The latter is problematic regarding Trump: What is known about his Ukraine involvement reveals nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 about his character or modus vivendi that was not already known. This is unfortunate but undeniable: Many millions voted for him because he promised that the loutishness of his campaigning foreshadowed his governing style. Promise keeping is a problematic ground for impeachment.\n\nAssumption College\u2019s Greg Weiner understands what he calls \u201cthe politics of prudence,\u201d and this truth: \u201cThat an offense is impeachable does not mean it warrants impeachment.\u201d Impeachment is unwarranted, for example, if the reasonable judgment of seasoned political people is that impeachment might enhance the political strength and longevity of the official whose behavior merits impeachment.\n\nThis might be a moment in this nation\u2019s life when worse is better: The squalor of the president\u2019s behavior regarding Ukraine, following so much other repulsive behavior, is giving many Americans second thoughts about presidential power, which has waxed as Congress has allowed, often eagerly, its power to wane. Impeachment, however dubious, might at least be a leading indicator of an overdue recalibration of our institutional equilibrium.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNevertheless, the best antidote for a bad election is a better election. The election the nation needs in 400 days would remove the nation\u2019s most recent mistake and inflict instructive carnage \u2014 the incumbent mistake likes this noun \u2014 on his abjectly obedient party.\n\nRead more from George F.
