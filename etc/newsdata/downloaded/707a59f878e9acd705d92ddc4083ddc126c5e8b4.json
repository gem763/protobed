At this point, the 1.23 GBP level should be minor support, but quite frankly if we can break down below there it\u2019s likely that the market continues to drop down towards the 1.20 GBP level, albeit in more of a grind than anything else.\n\nGBP/USD Video 27.09.19\n\nAt this point, if we rally above the top of the trading session for Thursday, then it\u2019s likely that we could go looking towards the 1.25 GBP level, which also coincides nicely with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. Beyond that, the 1.25 GBP level has previously been supportive, and now should act as resistance if it gets approached. The 200 day EMA is above there as well, and of course beyond that we have a whole plethora of reasons to feel that the British pound should continue to go lower for the longer-term.\n\nWith the circuits that is the Brexit, you will eventually get headlines in one direction or another that push this market around. All things been equal though, we have been in a downtrend for quite some time, and quite frankly I think there\u2019s a good reason for that. All things being equal I think the only thing you can count on here is going to be a headline driven volatility, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any end in sight right now.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The British pound has been somewhat choppy during the trading session on Thursday, which makes quite a bit of sense considering that we are sitting right at a cluster of order flow, and then of course dancing around the 50 day EMA.", "authors": ["Christopher Lewis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
