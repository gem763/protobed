(AP) - Florida defensive tackle Kyree Campbell has been counting down to this game for weeks, maybe even months.\n\nHe didn\u2019t need to hear about rankings or ramifications. He had no use for pep talks or other motivational ploys. He didn\u2019t want to talk about managing emotions or peaking too early.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this,\u201d he said, his eyes widening as post-practice sweat poured down his face. \u201cThis is big-boy ball right here.\u201d\n\nIt comes with big stakes, too.\n\nNo. 7 Auburn and the 10th-ranked Gators, once Southeastern Conference rivals who played annually, will meet for the first time in eight years Saturday in the Swamp. ESPN\u2019s College GameDay is on campus for the sold-out game, which is expected to include one of the largest crowds in school history.\n\nIt\u2019s homecoming for the Gators (5-0, 2-0 SEC), who will debut throwback uniforms from the 1960s.\n\nIt\u2019s the first top-10 matchup at Florida Field since the Gators thumped South Carolina 44-11 in October 2012. It\u2019s the first top-10 matchup featuring two undefeated teams since Florida edged LSU 14-6 that same season.\n\nIt\u2019s also essentially an early season elimination game for the College Football Playoff. Not that one loss knocks anyone out of contention in October, but considering Auburn (5-0, 2-0) still plays fifth-ranked LSU, No. 3 Georgia and top-ranked Alabama, and the Gators also face LSU and Georgia, the loser Saturday will be in a hole moving forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be handed to us,\u201d Florida receiver Tyrie Cleveland said. \u201cWe got to go take it.\u201d\n\nBoth teams have first-year starting quarterbacks , which could be concerning considering they\u2019re facing two of the league\u2019s top defenses.\n\nAuburn\u2019s Bo Nix, whose father, Patrick, upset top-ranked Florida in Gainesville in 1994, kicked off his college career with a game-winning touchdown pass in the final seconds against Oregon. In his first SEC game, Bo Nix helped beat Texas A&M; in a hostile road environment. Last week against Mississippi State, he had 335 yards passing and two touchdowns to go along with 56 yards rushing and a score - the first Auburn quarterback to put up those kind of numbers since Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton in 2010.\n\n\u201cHe played a lot of different teams, but he hasn\u2019t played in the Swamp,\u201d Florida defensive back Trey Dean said.\n\nThe Gators haven\u2019t allowed a touchdown in three home games this season, outscoring woeful Tennessee and two lower-division teams 117-3.\n\nAuburn presents a much tougher challenge, especially with running back JaTarvious Williams and speedy receiver Anthony Schwartz.\n\n\u201cWe like to throw a lot of different things at people, whether it is unusual formations or stuff like that,\u201d Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Kyle Trask, who played well in consecutive games in place of injured starter Feleipe Franks, hasn\u2019t faced a defensive front like the Tigers boast, either.\n\nAuburn has arguably the league\u2019s most disruptive D-line duo in Derrick Brown and Marlon Davidson, who could wreak havoc on a young offensive line that coach Dan Mullen ripped and challenged last week.\n\n\u201cThis is probably one of the best ones in 15 years I\u2019ve been in this league,\u201d Florida offensive line coach John Hevesy said.\n\nHere are some other things to know about the 84th meeting between Auburn and Florida:\n\nHEALTHY GATORS\n\nFlorida is expected to have its full complement of defensive players for the first time all season.\n\nSpeedy cornerback CJ Henderson and disruptive defensive end Jabari Zuniga are returning after missing three and two games, respectively. Linebacker Ventrell Miller and safeties Shawn Davis and Jeawon Taylor also return after sitting out last week\u2019s game.\n\nRECORD WATCH\n\nAuburn is closing in on an NCAA record, but getting it will require a few touchdowns and a few more successful kicks. The Tigers have made 299 consecutive extra-point attempts dating to 2013. It\u2019s the longest active streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Florida State holds the NCAA record of 302, set between 2012 and \u201816.\n\nRANKED ROAD WINS\n\nAuburn is seeking its third win against a ranked team away from home. The Tigers, who already beat then-No. 11 Oregon and then-17th-ranked Texas A&M;, have only done that five times and twice since 1983 (2004 and 2010).\n\nPAINFUL REMINDER\n\nThe last time Auburn visited Gainesville (2007), Mullen was Florida\u2019s offensive coordinator. But he remembers the 20-17 loss for a much different reason. Mullen had to have an emergency appendectomy the night before the game. His wife picked him up after the team\u2019s walkthrough, sneaked him in a backdoor at Shands Hospital, got a few hours of sleep, ended up getting into a fender-bender on his way to the stadium and then called plays from the booth with his doctor nearby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty funny story,\u201d Mullen said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Florida defensive tackle Kyree Campbell has been counting down to this game for weeks, maybe even months.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/mississippi_st_auburn_football_11751_c0-88-2106-1315_s1770x1032.jpg?05a21360f7419b070a87f8a915cfe2f23bad9c6b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
