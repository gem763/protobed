Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \u201cAre we supposed to negotiate over this? Are we supposed to wait until the president signs off on it?\u201d\n\nMr. Barr visited Capitol Hill on Wednesday to talk with lawmakers about expanding background checks and floated a proposal to do so.\n\nThe document, first reported by The Daily Caller, said background checks would be extended to include all commercial sales, including gun shows.\n\nThe checks would be conducted through a Federal Firearm License or a newly created class of license transfer agents. Sellers could keep their own records of the sale, though they could allow the FFL to store them.\n\nWhile it was the first step in testing a position for Mr. Trump and the Republicans, several senators said they needed more details before they could decide whether to support it.\n\nTheir questions included details on how the Federal Firearm Licensee system would be overhauled and operated, who would keep records of sales, and what enforcement penalties would be in place.\n\nWhen asked about the new class of licensing agents, Sen. Josh Hawley said he couldn\u2019t describe it because there was no text to work with.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to really nail it down,\u201d the Missouri Republican said.\n\nDespite the questions they had about the proposal, senators said it was a \u201cconstructive\u201d starting point.\n\nBut the biggest question remained: Where does the president stand?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an important piece \u2014 if the president doesn\u2019t support it, there\u2019s no point. It\u2019s not going to become law,\u201d Mr. Hawley said.\n\nIt was not clear what Mr. Trump thought of the proposal, with lawmakers pointing out that he hasn\u2019t signed off on it and Mr. Barr was taking a temperature check.\n\nHe did, however, fire a warning shot Wednesday, slamming Democratic presidential contender Beto O\u2019Rourke for proposing a mandatory buyback plan for AK-style guns.\n\n\u201cDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cConvinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away. Will continue forward!\u201d\n\nWhile Senate Republicans mulled background checks, their colleagues in the House pushed back against the notion.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday, Minority Whip Steve Scalise and several other House Republicans said Democrats were rushing to push through ineffective solutions.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, whenever we hear about a tragedy, before we even know the facts, there are people right here on Capitol Hill that are rushing to find a microphone not to pray for the victims but to promote their own gun control agenda,\u201d Mr. Scalise said.\n\nRather than focus on expanding the national background check system, which they argued doesn\u2019t work, the House Republicans argued the real solution would be in addressing the factors that are breaking down society and in restoring family and religious institutions.\n\nNewly elected Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs shot down Mr. Barr\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the appetite is [in the GOP], but I personally wouldn\u2019t support it,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also didn\u2019t receive any help from the National Rifle Association.\n\n\u201cThis missive is a non-starter with the NRA and our 5 million members because it burdens law-abiding gun owners while ignoring what actually matters: fixing the broken mental health system and the prosecution of violent criminals,\u201d Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, told Politico.\n\nDemocrats have pressed Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans to pass the universal background checks bill that the House passed earlier this year.\n\nRepublicans have shot down that option, with several members saying they are concerned about how it would affect private sales between individuals.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer appealed directly to Mr. Trump on the phone Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis morning, we made it clear to the president that any proposal that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done,\u201d they wrote in a statement. \u201cWe will not stop until these bills are passed and our children\u2019s lives are safe. We call upon Sen. [Mitch] McConnell to \u2018Give Us a Vote!\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Democratic leadership didn\u2019t say they would refuse to take up a weaker version of universal background checks, with both Mr. Hoyer and Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries saying they would need to see what the Republicans offered before making a decision.\n\nRank-and-file Democrats agreed to wait and see rather than prepare to block a weaker version of their bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep an open mind to see what they bring forward, but I agree with the speaker of the House in that if there are loopholes then people will find ways to get access to guns and we will not have delivered,\u201d said Rep. Veronica Escobar, whose Texas community lost 20 people in the El Paso shooting.\n\nHowever, they did say they expect the vast majority of their bill to be included.\n\nMeanwhile, the momentum for any bill addressing gun violence remains with the president.\n\n\u201cReally I think the president needs to make a public declaration that this is what he is for or something else and I think that will clarify things and get us further down the road than we are now,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
