The purse was hanging off the back of her chair.\n\nThe woman briefly turns around just after the man reaches into the bag, but he quickly stuffs the wallet into the front of his pants before walking away from the scene.\n\nThe incident happened during daytime hours on Sep. 25 in the area of Highway 7 East and Woodbine Avenue in Markham.\n\nPolice are seeking two suspects in connection to the theft. They are described as white males wearing Vegas Golden Knights and Toronto Maple Leafs baseball caps at the time of the incident.\n\nIn another recent string of distraction thefts, police say suspects have approached victims while placing fake jewelry around their necks and hands.
