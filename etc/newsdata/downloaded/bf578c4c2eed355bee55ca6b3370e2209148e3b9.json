By the time he reached his destination, however, he had reinvented himself.\n\nAbandoning his wife, children and career, he was going to devote himself to painting. His journey was only 350 miles, but, over that distance, Gauguin, then 38, had been transformed from a bourgeois gentleman into a bohemian artist.\n\nThe results of that decision are on view next week, when the Gauguin Portraits exhibition opens at the National Gallery in London, featuring much of the work he produced in what was then considered a backwater.\n\nInspiring: In Concarneau, pictured, Gauguin contemplated the fishing boats bobbing on the waves \u2014 and got into a fight with locals over a woman\n\n\u2018Brittany was regarded as both French and not-French at the same time,\u2019 says Christopher Riopelle, co-curator of the exhibition. This remote corner was an oddity, populated by a strange Celtic people who spoke Breton, not French, and hung on to their customs.\n\n\u2018It was seen as a deeply traditional and Christian community, where females still covered their hair in public,\u2019 he adds.\n\nGauguin was captivated by the beauty of the local women, as surely as he would be during his later voyages to the South Seas.\n\nOne of a number of artists drawn to Brittany\u2019s southern coast, Gauguin settled in the small town of Pont-Aven, where he found cheap lodgings, the convivial company of other painters and young Breton women willing to model.\n\nHe believed he had found his Garden of Eden. \u2018I love Brittany, the wildness, the primitiveness,\u2019 he wrote in a letter to a friend. \u2018When my wooden clogs strike this granite ground, I hear the muffled, dull, powerful tone that I seek in my painting.\u2019\n\nAmong woods and streams, he could work freely, as long as the locals left him alone.\n\nBut relations were often strained. In one hotel, the regulars wanted shot of these irritating interlopers. Going out to paint every morning, they would return to their lodgings for lunch, placing their wet canvases along the walls to dry.\n\nThere were complaints: the sight of their garish daubs was putting customers off their food. Could they eat elsewhere? Faced with eviction, the artists turned their wonderful artworks to the wall and lunchtime service was resumed.\n\nIn Brittany, Gauguin's style became bolder and more colourful. He was captivated by the beauty of the local women\n\nToday, Pont-Aven is proud of its artistic credentials, happy to proclaim itself the City of Painters. It was here that the power of colour was unleashed.\n\nGauguin and his circle threw off their airy style in favour of violent hues and bold forms. \u2018There was a decisive break with naturalism and with Impressionists,\u2019 says Riopelle.\n\nBecause colour expressed emotion, a tree could be purple or orange. Look at the technicolor, jewel-like shades of Bonjour Monsieur Gauguin (1889) \u2014 above right \u2014 to appreciate the stylistic shift.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that, in high summer, the town is packed with tourists strolling around in stripey Breton tops and drinking outside Les Ajoncs d\u2019Or, the hotel where Gauguin lodged. But why not visit in autumn, as we did, when the leaves are turning a Post-Impressionist yellow and the day-trippers have departed?\n\nWe enjoyed a languid afternoon strolling along the banks of the Aven in the Bois d\u2019Amour, much depicted by the artists.\n\nMany of their works have made their way into the superlative town museum, more than justifying Pont-Aven\u2019s claim to be the cradle of modern art.\n\nWe repaired next door to Les Ajoncs D\u2019Or for oysters and filet mignon, around \u00a330 for three courses. Be sure to book and turn up on time \u2014 diners arriving after 9pm were turned away.\n\nGauguin\u2019s statue may dominate the centre of Pont-Aven, but his spirit is to be found throughout this region. Known as Finist\u00e8re, \u2018the end of the earth\u2019, it is the westernmost part of France, jutting out into the Atlantic.\n\nGauguin settled in the small town of Pont-Aven, pictured, where he found cheap lodgings, the convivial company of other painters and young Breton women willing to model\n\nThis crinkled, cookie-cutter coastline also styles itself the Breton Riviera. With the sun shining every day, we extended our stay to explore Gauguin\u2019s Eden: a 90-mile stretch of coastline between the walled harbour of Concarneau and the sandy beaches of Billiers.\n\nAlong our route, we passed stone farmhouses bordered by wild hydrangeas and stopped for cooling dips in sandy bays framed by cypresses.\n\nBowling along empty roads lined with orchards, we saw trees bent under the weight of apples. Perhaps this really was a Garden of Eden.\n\nIn Concarneau, Gauguin contemplated the fishing boats bobbing on the waves \u2014 and got into a fight with locals over a woman. Always a troublemaker.\n\nSome 30 miles along the coast, at Le Pouldu, he lodged in La Buvette de la Plage, which is now a museum.\n\nMake sure to stop at the family-run Hotel Du Pouldu, a favourite with the locals. Its riverfront cafe, the Ster Laita, has the shortest menu I\u2019ve ever seen in France \u2014 oysters and shrimps.\n\nWe ended our road trip with a stay at the secluded Domaine de Rochevilaine, on a rocky headland. From its terrace, you are flanked by sea on three sides.\n\nThe setting sun turned the sky orange and the distant trees black. Or, as Gauguin would see it, violet and purple.\n\nHow fortunate we are that he travelled to the end of the earth for art.", "description": "A new exhibition of Gauguin Portraits opens at the National Gallery in London next week featuring much of the work he produced in Brittany, which was then considered a backwater.", "authors": ["Deirdre Fernand For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19312876-0-image-a-83_1570218522297.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
