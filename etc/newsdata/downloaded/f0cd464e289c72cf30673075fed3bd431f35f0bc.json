He looked visibly shaken on Saturday after taking an aerial tour of Abaco, which bore the brunt of Dorian\u2019s impact.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Personnel from the Royal Bahamas Police Force remove a body recovered in a destroyed neighborhood in the wake of Hurricane Dorian in Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco, Bahamas, September 9, 2019.
