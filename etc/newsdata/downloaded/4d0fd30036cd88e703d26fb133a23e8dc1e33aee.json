The Floods and their son said the school district had punished T.F. based on the false accusations, but failed to punish the accusing students for lying.\n\nIn his opinion, Chief U.S. District Judge Mark R. Hornak in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, an Obama appointee, wrote that the Floods\u2019 complaint \u201cfails to plead that a final policymaker took any action toward T.F. that could represent official policy attributable to the school district.\u201d\n\nHornak continued:\n\nThe court also concludes that the amended complaint fails to plead that any final policymaker of the school district had knowledge or constructive knowledge of prior events of sexual misconduct such that any final policymaker could have been \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to the need for additional safeguards against disparate applications of school district policy.\n\nIn 2017, a teacher reportedly heard K.S. tell other students T.F. sexually assaulted her while both students had worked at the Zelienople Community Pool during the summer.\n\nThe teacher reported K.S.\u2019s remarks, and K.S. was subsequently summoned to the guidance counselor\u2019s office where she repeated her accusation against T.F. The counselor reported the accusation to Childline, a program for reports of child abuse and neglect.\n\nK.S. repeated her accusations of sexual assault against T.F. to a forensic interviewer.\n\nT.F. was then charged with indecent assault and two counts of harassment.\n\nAfter K.S. said T.F.\u2019s presence in her classes made her \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d the high school principal changed T.F.\u2019s class schedule and the boy underwent a consent decree whereby he did not plead guilty to the charges but agreed to a six-month probation under the supervision of the Butler County Juvenile Probation Department.\n\nIn March 2018, one of the other students, C.S., invited T.F. to her home to hang out with friends. T.F. said he went to C.S.\u2019s home, where he saw C.S., E.S., and H.R. drinking alcohol. T.F. said he did not drink alcohol and left the party early.\n\nThree days after the gathering at C.S.\u2019s home, other students at Seneca Valley Intermediate High School heard K.S. and C.S. devising a plan that C.S. would make a false statement to the guidance counselor that T.F. came to her home, uninvited, and sexually assaulted her.\n\nFollowing the false statement to the guidance counselor, C.S., E.S., and H.R. gave the same allegations to the Butler County Alliance for Children. H.R. also proceeded to tell other students about their accusations against T.F.\n\nT.F. was subsequently charged with indecent assault, forcible compulsion, criminal trespass and simple assault in April 2018. The police placed him in leg and wrist shackles and removed him from class. After a hearing, he was held at the Keystone Education Center for nine days and was then released on house arrest with an ankle monitor.\n\nAt school, Seneca Valley athletic director Heather Lewis prohibited T.F. from playing baseball, though Butler County probation officials informed the Floods he would be permitted to do so.\n\nOnce the Floods began to investigate the charges against their son and obtained exculpatory evidence, E.S. and H.R. admitted to lying about the sexual assault, and T.F.\u2019s ankle monitor was removed.\n\nIn August, all charges against T.F. were dropped. The school district did not punish K.S., C.S., E.S., and H.R.\n\n\u201cEven if Plaintiffs could succeed in demonstrating that the principal\u2019s decision to not punish the minor Defendants was an act attributable to the School District as the act of a final policymaker, the Plaintiffs would \u201cbear[] the additional burden of proving\u201d that this act \u201cwas the proximate cause of the injuries suffered,\u201d the judge wrote in his opinion, and continued:\n\nThe \u201cdeprivation of federal rights\u201d allegedly caused by School District action was changing T.F.\u2019s class schedule and preventing T.F. from playing baseball for Seneca Valley. Even if the minor Defendants were later punished by the school for their allegedly false allegations, this later punishment would have no effect on the punishment that had already been inflicted upon T.F. Plaintiffs may not think it is fair that the minor Defendants were not punished, but this is not enough to satisfy causation here.\n\n\u201cThe assertion that T.F. \u2018s psychological and physical harms are being exacerbated by \u2018enduring the injustice\u2019 of knowing that his accusers have not been punished \u2026 is too attenuated from any School District action to demonstrate proximate causation,\u201d the judge said.", "description": "A federal judge has dismissed the defamation case of a Pennsylvania high school student who was falsely accused of sexual assault.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/gavel-court-decision-sentence-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
