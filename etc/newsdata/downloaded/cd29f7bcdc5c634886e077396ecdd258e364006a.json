Two will remain in D.C., including the branch chief, and the remainder will be assigned to state-level environmental review jobs, according to one source with direct knowledge of the plan.\n\nSome of the team members are expected to quit BLM rather than make the move, so Interior will have to hire and train new staffers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically lopping the head off the animal,\u201d said one person in the agency who has knowledge of the plan but was not authorized to speak to the press. \u201cThere will be nobody in the D.C. office to help guide the process.\u201d\n\nThe NEPA review team members have not been given a deadline for agreeing to the move, the people added.\n\nA second person with knowledge of the plan warned that rather than improving efficiency by moving staff out of Washington, Interior may actually hamper its operations. The employees in question are in charge of coordinating project analysis across states and shepherding projects that have finished review to the department\u2019s decision makers in D.C. They also help translate a new administration\u2019s policy priorities to staff working in different states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to slow things down, it\u2019s not going to speed things up,\u201d the person said of the planned staff relocations. \u201cRoads, transmission lines, energy-related, horse-and-burro related. Whether you\u2019re oil and gas or renewables or anything in between, it will slow things down.\u201d\n\nBLM spokesperson Jeff Krauss declined to comment on the transfers of the D.C.-based environmental review team or how such a split might impact permit times. Krauss also did not directly respond to questions about when BLM senior political staff are expected to move to Colorado.\n\n\u201cWe are working to get them out there as expeditiously as possible,\u201d Krauss said.\n\nInterior Secretary David Bernhardt, who is driving the relocation process, has touted the moves of at least two-thirds of BLM\u2019s 550 D.C.-based positions as a way to increase efficiency at the agency that oversees the federal government's vast land holdings.\n\nBut critics contend that Interior's reorganization plans appear designed to push out career staff and give more leeway to political appointees to pick and choose which projects go forward.\n\n\u201cThis administration pretends to make personnel moves based on clearly thought-out, perfectly legitimate criteria that it just can\u2019t publicize right now,\u201d House Natural Resources Chairman Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s been a clear scheme for a long time now to destroy our natural resources and the people who help us manage them responsibly.\u201d\n\nThe reorganization plan has also run afoul of congressional budget makers. Appropriations committees in the House and Senate have cut funding for the reorganization project from bills for the coming fiscal year and directed the agency to halt the relocation project. Despite that, Interior has said \u201cthe BLM relocation is moving full speed ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are serious questions about both efficiency and effectiveness with the scattering that is currently being contemplated,\u201d said Nada Culver, vice president of public lands and senior policy counsel at the National Audubon Society.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that both will be affected,\u201d Culver added. \u201cEven more, that the administration continues on its current course of making decisions primarily by a few people at the department in D.C. with less and less room for input from the field and career staff, so the basis for the decisions is less and less sound.\u201d\n\nOil and gas companies have long complained that the environmental review process takes too long to complete. Erik Milito, vice president of upstream of industry operations for trade association American Petroleum Association, didn\u2019t comment on whether moving environmental review leadership team members to western states would impact permitting, but said it was important the NEPA process was handled effectively.\n\n\u201cGood government is essential to the advancement of domestic energy production on federal lands,\u201d Milito siad. \u201cWe want a BLM that works, regardless of the location.\"\n\nThis article tagged under: Environment", "description": "\"It\u2019s basically lopping the head off the animal.\"", "authors": ["Ben Lefebvre"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f2/cd/191b95974292ae9f34ac0c63e890/190925-westlands-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
