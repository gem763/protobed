They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found.\n\nAlso, see Andy\u2019s book on this.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Trump is angry over the Russian investigation and would like to find out more about how it began. As I\u2019ve said to Trump critics a couple of times this week when discussing the element of the Ukraine story that involves looking back to 2016, it\u2019s very easy to be blas\u00e9 about someone else being falsely accused of something \u2014 in this case, something very big actually, a treacherous conspiracy with Russia \u2014 when we all get very angry when we ourselves are falsely accused of something, even when very minor. It\u2019s also got to be irksome to watch the same people all over cable TV who leaped to the darkest conclusions about Russia, and who expressed not a hiccup of regret or self-reflection over it subsequently, now leap to the darkest conclusions about Ukraine.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t excuse any impropriety on Trump\u2019s part or his wild and abusive attacks on his critics (lowlife, traitor, etc.), but there\u2019s no way to understand his opponents\u2019 or his own reaction to this without fully grappling with what come before.", "description": "There\u2019s no way to understand his opponents' or his own reaction to this without fully grappling with what come before.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
