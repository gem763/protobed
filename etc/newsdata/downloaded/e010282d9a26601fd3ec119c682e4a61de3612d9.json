You decide (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nIt\u2019s Friday \u2013 you\u2019ve had a stressful week, and now you\u2019re debating whether you should go to the gym tonight, or go to the pub.\n\nReally, it depends on just how stressed you are. While hitting the gym for a tough session can help to relieve stress under the right circumstances, being too stressed can actually hinder your progress and make your workout pretty pointless.\n\nSo if you\u2019re feeling burnt out, exhausted and anxious from a busy week \u2013 taking a night off from the gym might not be such a bad idea.\n\nFreeletics expert David Wiener has explained exactly why you shouldn\u2019t work out if you\u2019re feeling too stressed:\n\nIt throws you off your game\n\nWhen you\u2018re coping with a big life event, or you\u2018re \u2018so behind\u2019 at work, it becomes the only thing you can focus on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat suffers most? That evening run you had planned is sacrificed for more time at the office or winding down on the sofa.\n\nStress has the annoying ability to distract your mind and overwhelm your body, not to mention making you a lot less likely to stick to your training regime.\n\nApart from skewing your motivation, you\u2018ll have a hard time reaching your fitness goals when your mind is elsewhere. When stress makes your training become another thing on your to-do list, the quality of your workout will suffer as you\u2018ll sacrifice technique in favour of getting it done and dusted as soon as possible.\n\nWhile it may be difficult to push your worries to the side, dwelling won\u2018t make it go away. Exercise combined with other stress management techniques, such as meditation, can really help to calm you down and keep you focused and motivated.\n\nStress can make your throw your schedule out the window (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nIt hinders your recovery\n\nIt\u2018s normal to feel a bit sore after a workout, but when you\u2018re stressed, the effects are multiplied because your muscles are stressed too.\n\nThe mental demands of stress steal valuable resources from your body and leave you feeling more run down and groggy than usual. When this is combined with a tough workout, it\u2018ll leave you with nothing left in the tank.\n\nUnless you want to risk injuring yourself, it\u2018s important to give your muscles and your mind time to recover following a strenuous workout. This means taking regular rest days and mixing up your style of training to maximise its effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt plays havoc with your cortisol levels\n\nChronic stress hurts your ability to regulate the hormone cortisol, which influences your metabolism, immunity, sleep rhythms and blood pressure.\n\nUn-regulated cortisol levels will leave you feeling run-down, tired, and more subject to gaining weight, as well as making you crave more sugary and fatty food.\n\nLack of sleep coupled with stress is a total killer when it comes to reaching your fitness goals. And even worse when your goal is to lose weight.\n\nSleep is essential in helping you restore your muscles after training and feeling refreshed and energised the next day. You can regulate your cortisol levels by turning in early at night and getting a proper sleep.\n\nIt increases your risk of injury\n\nResearch suggests that exercising when you\u2019re experiencing stress can increase your risk of injury, and this could be for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirstly, if you\u2019re overly stressed it\u2019s likely you\u2019re not focusing properly on your workout or technique, and your wavering attention could be the cause of an injury.\n\nWhen you\u2019re stressed, your muscles are stressed too (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nSecondly, when you\u2019re stressed, you experience increased muscles tension and this too could set you on the road to an injury or make any existing aches and pains worse.\n\nYou\u2019ll fatigue quicker\n\nStress affects the part of your brain which deals with both short- and long-term memory, as well as working memory, which is what you use when you\u2019re processing multiple pieces of information at once.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis can make even the simplest of tasks more difficult and means that you\u2019ll mentally and physically fatigue more quickly which will impact on your workout.\n\nIt sabotages weight loss goals\n\nCortisol or the stress hormone as it is known is far higher when you\u2019re experiencing stress, and high levels of cortisol encourages insulin production which could result in sugar cravings. It can also slow down your metabolism, which isn\u2019t good news if weight loss is your goal.\n\nIncreased levels of cortisol can also make it difficult to lose body fat, especially in the abdomen areas.\n\nDavid think\u2019s it\u2019s important to remember that exercise can also be a remedy if you\u2019re feeling a bit stressed \u2013 it\u2019s all about knowing your body and understanding when you need to slow down.\n\n\u2018Stress can also motivate you,\u2019 says David. \u2018A slight increase in cortisol from moderate stress has proven to have a positive impact on performance.\n\n\u2018The one upside to knowing how to weather tough times is that you have experience performing under pressure. This results in more confidence, so rather than seeing stress as a barrier to your success, try viewing it as an obstacle you\u2018ve overcome in the past, and that you\u2018ll no doubt succeed at again.\n\n\u2018It\u2018s all about your state of mind, and if you use stress to fire up your workout, you\u2018ll be amazed at what you can achieve.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Which tea bags have plastic in them?\n\nMORE: The hottest fitness trends for 2020\n\nMORE: The fitness industry is overwhelmingly white \u2013 and that needs to change\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Fitness experts tell us why it's not a good idea to work out if you're feeling too stressed.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/untitled-3_1569590756.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
