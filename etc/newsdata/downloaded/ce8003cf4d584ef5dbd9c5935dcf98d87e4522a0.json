He will become Wells Fargo\u2019s third CEO in as many years after a wide-ranging sales practices scandal. Some analysts said Scharf\u2019s departure from Bank of New York Mellon, where he served only for two years, would hurt the custodian bank. Bank of New York Mellon named former finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis. Its shares closed 4.2% lower, while Wells Fargo rose 3.5% on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good choice,\u201d said former Wells Fargo CEO Dick Kovacevich. \u201cHe\u2019s very experienced in almost all of these financial services areas.\u201d\n\nScharf has his work cut out for him.\n\nWells Fargo is operating under a regulatory microscope, as it tries to rebuild its reputation with customers, investors and politicians after employee whistleblowers revealed in 2016 that the bank had opened potentially millions of unauthorised accounts.\n\nSince then, internal and regulatory probes have discovered other issues in the bank\u2019s businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines and penalties.\n\nIts core businesses and shares have lagged.\n\nFrom 2016-2018, Wells Fargo was the only bank among the top four U.S. lenders to not grow loans or deposits, according to Refinitiv data. Wells Fargo shares have fallen short of the KBW Bank Index as the board looked for a new CEO. Analysts cited uncertainly about management and future financial targets as a top concern.\n\nOn Friday, Wall Street analysts applauded the bank\u2019s pick but warned that major regulatory hurdles remained.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of Mr. Scharf removes a major overhang,\u201d Saul Martinez of UBS wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWhile the news cheered Wells Fargo investors, analysts said it was a negative for Bank of New York Mellon.\n\nKBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells\u2019 CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years.\n\nHe added that at Bank of New York, Scharf had gone \u201con a hiring spree to bring in his people, and now that he has left, long-term strategy is in flux.\u201d\n\nDIVERSITY GOAL\n\nScharf\u2019s appointment is a win for Wells Fargo. Sources have said that the board\u2019s search process was fraught, with limits on how much the bank could have paid its new chief executive and the requirement that regulators approved of their choice.\n\nThe board had said it wanted to find an outsider, a key parameter for satisfying critics in Washington. The board also initially looked the possibility of hiring a diverse candidate, especially a woman, sources have previously said.\n\nBut several candidates that the board approached were not interested in the job. At one point, the board considered keeping its interim CEO, Allen Parker, on a permanent basis.\n\nParker will return to his previous role of general counsel and help the company through its transition.\n\n\u201cThey really realized that they needed a competent CEO who could handle the issues at Wells and the regulators, and it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 race, gender, those things were secondary,\u201d one of the sources familiar with the matter said, referring to the board.\n\nWells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on the nature of the search process. A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of Currency said the banking regulator had signed off on Scharf\u2019s hiring, clearing a major hurdle in the executive search process.\n\nTwo sources who know Scharf describe him as someone more at home with numbers. When he became the CEO at Visa, people joked the company had two chief financial officers - the actual CFO and Scharf, one of the sources said.\n\nAt Visa, he is credited with transforming the payment giant\u2019s technology platform and saw the stock price more than double. Scharf was tasked with reinvigorating growth at BNY, a custodian bank which executes back office operations for asset managers.\n\nThere he quickly made changes designed to make the company more efficient like overhauling meetings and making leadership changes. So far those changes have not paid off as BNY shares are trading lower than when Scharf took the helm.\n\nOne of the sources said Scharf always had aspirations to be the chief executive of a big bank. If his tenure at the San Fransico-based bank goes well, Scharf will have a claim to the same fame as his one-time boss Dimon, the source said.", "description": "After a difficult, months-long search for a new chief executive, scandal-plagued Wells Fargo & Co named as its next leader Charles Scharf, a one-time Jamie Dimon prot\u00e9g\u00e9 known on Wall Street as a detail-oriented number cruncher who excels in streamlining operations.
