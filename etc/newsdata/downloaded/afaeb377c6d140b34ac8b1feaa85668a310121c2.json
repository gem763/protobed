The red and white BangBros colours may have thrown the drunk man off.\n\nThe company said they associate so closely with the city that, in September, they placed a $10 million bid to grab naming rights for the Miami Heat stadium.\n\nThe plan was to change it to BBC or 'Bang Bros Cares' after American Airlines pulled out of renewing their contract earlier this year.\n\nIn a Twitter statement, BangBros said: 'Miami is known for many things-South Beach, beautiful women, and sports teams like the professional NBA team the Miami Heat.\n\n'Miami is also known for BangBros.'\n\nJewels confirmed that the person in the video was her through her Twitter account\n\nBang Bros said that both the Heat and their company were staples of the city and it would be a great sponsorship opportunity\n\n'So it makes sense to pair up winning programs like the Miami Heat and BangBros for a sponsorship opportunity, naming the home arena they play in.\n\n'Both the Heat and BangBros have become staples of the city, with huge fans of each.\n\n'It doesn\u2019t get more Miami than having the arena sponsored by BangBros.\n\n'To show how serious BangBros is, they have already offered $10million, and are suggesting the name BangBros Center ('The BBC') as the new home of the Miami Heat for the next decade.'", "description": "Miami based porn star, Valentina Jewels, 21, was the victim of a drunk fan's expletive-filled rant during an NFL contest between the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins on Sunday.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/08/19728644-0-image-a-2_1571125038350.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
