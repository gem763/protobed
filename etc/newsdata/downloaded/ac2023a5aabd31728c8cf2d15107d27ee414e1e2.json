I was under the impression that the term is used in federal law.\n\nGoogling it later, I found a recent Chicago Tribune article that says my impression was wrong. Reports Cindy Dampier:\n\nClaire Thomas, a professor in immigration law and director of the Asylum Clinic at New York Law School, . . . points out another common misconception: That the term is used in statutes and in legal circles. \u201cThe term illegal alien isn\u2019t a term that comes up in our laws,\u201d she says, noting that it does appear very rarely in pieces of federal legislation. \u201cHowever, the term \u2018alien\u2019 is in our statutes, and you will hear people referred to as \u2018the alien,\u2019 when you are representing them.\u201d\n\nThis is a little odd on its face. How can it be a \u201cmisconception\u201d that the term is used in statutes, and how can it be true that it \u201cisn\u2019t a term that comes up in our laws,\u201d when it \u201cdoes appear,\u201d albeit rarely, \u201cin pieces of federal legislation\u201d? Is the idea that it appears in legislation that has not passed, but does not appear in the U.S. Code? If so, the idea is wrong. The term appears several times in the code, as this blogpost notes. See, for example, 8 USC 1365, helpfully titled, \u201cReimbursement of States for costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and certain Cuban nationals.\u201d", "description": "How can it be a \"misconception\" that the term \"illegal alien\" is used in statutes, and how can it be true that it \"isn't a term that comes up in our laws,\" when it \"does appear,\" albeit rarely, \"in pieces of federal legislation\"?", "authors": ["Ramesh Ponnuru", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Kevin D.
