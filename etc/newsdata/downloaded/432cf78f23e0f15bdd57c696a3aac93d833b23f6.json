It occurs when a bone marrow cell develops errors in its DNA.\n\nHis mother, Graycen Gannon, 23, had feared something was seriously wrong with her young son 18 months earlier as he was covered in bruises and slept all the time.\n\nBut doctors assured her he didn't have leukaemia.\n\nChayse Gannon (pictured with his mum Graycen) was just three weeks shy of his third birthday when he was flown from his home in small town Bega, in New South Wales, to Sydney Children's Hospital\n\nHe was diagnosed with Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia and started chemotherapy the next morning. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common childhood cancer. It occurs when a bone marrow cell develops errors in its DNA\n\nBy the time doctors discovered his cancer, little Chayse had cancer in 96 per cent of his bone marrow and 16 per cent in his blood cells.\n\nMs Gannon told Daily Mail Australia it was bitter sweet finally getting the diagnosis.\n\nShe said it was a relief to know what was wrong with her son so treatment could start but gut-wrenching knowing how long it had taken for him to finally be diagnosed.\n\n'I'm annoyed it wasn't picked up earlier.\n\n'The doctor said to me that my son didn't have leukaemia, but then about 45 minutes later another doctor told me he might have it.'\n\nThe past ten months have been incredibly challenging for the family.\n\nChayse required six months of aggressive chemotherapy and 18 months on maintenance - meaning two years of treatment.\n\nHowever, his time spent undergoing aggressive chemotherapy has been set back after a number of complications, including a rare reaction to one of the drugs.\n\nDuring the first three months of his treatment he was unable to leave Sydney Children's Hospital, so Chayse and his mother remained in the city while his dad Dan and younger brother, 14-month-old Cohen, remained in Bega.\n\nDuring the first three months of his treatment he was unable to leave Sydney Children's Hospital, so Chayse and his mother remained in the city his dad Dan (pictured) and younger brother Cohen remained in Bega\n\nThe past ten months have been incredibly challenging for the family. Chayse required six months of aggressive chemotherapy and 18 months on maintenance - meaning two years of treatment\n\nThe couple, who try to see each other once a fortnight, have also been struggling to make ends meet.\n\n'It's been hard, it's upsetting being away from my youngest son and my husband,' Ms Gannon said.\n\nWhat is Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia? Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. When the bone marrow fills with leukaemia cells, there is little room for healthy red cells and platelets to be produced. This can cause fatigue, bleeding problems and other health issues. Symptoms include fever and bruising.

For them, they rarely look to the future though - they just focus on each day as it come\n\n'The only place he knew was a hospital bed, because everywhere else was so different each time.\n\n'It was really, really hard for us.'\n\nBecause they were eligible for the Ronald McDonald House they weren't able to access funds from the Leukaemia Foundation.\n\nEventually she found an apartment in Coogee to rent for $5,000 a month but they have to rely on family to help cover the cost.\n\nThey have also had help from donations raised through a fundraising page, which was set up by a family friend.\n\nDespite the help, the family still has a long road ahead of them. Chayse has about one month left of the aggressive chemotherapy before he starts maintenance.\n\nFor them, they rarely look to the future though - they just focus on each day as it come.\n\n'We never know what to expect with Chayse ... we're just slowly working towards our goal of bringing him home,' Mr Gannon said.", "description": "Chayse\u00a0Gannon was just three weeks shy of his third birthday when he was flown from his home in small town\u00a0Bega, in New South Wales, to\u00a0Sydney children's hospital.", "authors": ["Kelsey Wilkie For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/05/19973454-0-image-a-29_1571630679536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
