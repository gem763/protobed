The proclaimed \"network-connected anti-infantry and armor smart UGVs\" (unmanned ground vehicles) prototypes were on display at an Army weapons expo in Tehran.\n\nThe six-wheeled boxy bots, according to images and videos released by NEZAJA, come in six versions\u2014including two that carry assault rifles mounted to their tops and one that is essentially a mobile anti-tank mine. The vehicles are topped with pairs of ruggedized antennae and small cameras; the assault-rifle equipped versions also appear to have a telescopic optic sensor for weapons aiming.\n\nProject Heidar-1\n\nNetwork-connected anti-infantry and armor smart UGVs pic.twitter.com/EvFfxh3Ehg \u2014 Iran Military (@Iran_Military) October 4, 2019\n\nIn the video released in the Twitter post above, the UGVs fire their guns, and one rolls toward a tank-like target before exploding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of remote-controlled uncrewed ground vehicles is not uncommon in the Middle East\u2014ISIS and other non-state organizations have built their own from commercially available parts. And the concept of remote-controlled moving weapons dates back to World War I with the French Army's use of radio-controlled \"land torpedoes\"; the Germans would use the cable-tethered Goliath tracked mine against tanks in World War II.\n\nBut as Samuel Bendett, an adviser at the Center for Naval Analyses, told C4ISRNet's Kelsey Atherton, this is the first time that Iran has publicly displayed armed UGVs.\" Equally interesting is their claim that this will be a \u2018networked\u2019 system of vehicles that can presumably function in more or less autonomous mode,\" Bendett added. But the prototypes displayed are still essentially remote-controlled vehicles.", "description": "Heidar 1 project's uncrewed ground vehicles shoot guns, roll under tanks, blow up.", "authors": ["Sean Gallagher"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Irangroundbots-760x380.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
