And market experts like Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research, think the days of Treasury bonds getting a 4% or 5% yield are long gone.\n\nRead: Grim choice for investors: Accept very low bond yields or face a 50% crash in stocks, strategist says\n\nAll is not lost, according to Ben Bernanke, who led the Fed through the aftermath of the Great Recession.\n\nDuring a panel discussion hosted by the Brookings Institution, he estimate the Fed\u2019s so-called unconventional policies, if used wisely, are the equivalent of 3 percentage point of interest rate cuts.\n\nThose policies are forward guidance, bond buying, commonly called quantitative easing, and a new policy-framework that includes a \u201cmakeup strategy\u201d for inflation, he said.\n\n\u201cSo my sense is as long as nominal neutral rates are 2.5%-3%, that the Fed will be able to do most of what it could do at any point in history,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the neutral rate does sink further, the Fed could be in a \u201cdifficult situation,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the same panel, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said he was not sanguine that the Fed had the necessary ammunition to fight a downturn.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re still arguing about the effectiveness of QE, after all these years, is persuasive evidence that the evidence isn\u2019t that persuasive,\u201d he said.\n\nConcerns about the economic expansion have picked up in recent days after a weak reading of the U.S. factory sector released by the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nBusiness investment is being hurt by uncertainty over the trade war between the U.S. and China. The concern is that this weakness will spillover into the consumer sector, which has been holding up the economy.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47% was higher Thursday in afternoon trading after having fallen by 838 points over the past two trading days on recession fears.", "description": "The Federal Reserve has more ammunition than thought to counter the next recession, said former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS613_bernan_ZG_20191003135257.jpg"}
