He wasted little time blaming those issues on the city\u2019s superintendent of police, Eddie Johnson, who boycotted the event.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a man that could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs \u2026 in his hometown and with the president of the United States. And you know why? It\u2019s because he\u2019s not doing his job,\u201d Trump told the gathering of law enforcement officials.\n\nTrump also hit Chicago over its \"sanctuary city\" policies, accusing Johnson of harboring undocumented immigrants at the expense of the safety of U.S. citizens and betraying his oath of duty.\n\n\u201cPeople like Johnson put criminals and illegal aliens before the citizens of Chicago, and those are his values,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFrankly, those values, to me, are a disgrace.\u201d\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) delivered opening remarks over the weekend at the police conference. But Johnson, who has been superintendent since April 2016, said he would not attend because Trump\u2019s presence did not align with his or the city\u2019s \u201ccore values.\u201d\n\nChicago officials have been outspoken in their opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. The city has branded itself a sanctuary city and pledged not to cooperate with federal immigration officials.\n\nTrump used parts of his Monday speech to promote his immigration agenda, touting his long-sought wall along the southern border and bringing the leaders of Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Drug Enforcement Administration on stage.\n\nMonday marked Trump\u2019s first time in Chicago since taking office, and he was greeted by protests. He is scheduled to attend a fundraiser in the afternoon at Trump Tower along the Chicago River.\n\nTrump has long used the city of Chicago \u2014 which voted overwhelmingly against him in 2016 \u2014 as a foil when arguing for law enforcement reforms and tougher policing. In remarks at the same conference a year earlier, in Orlando, Fla., he suggested the city implement the legally dubious practice of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d to cut down on crime.\n\nOn Monday, he seized on the city\u2019s crime rate to paint it as a bastion of violence and lawlessness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to us as a nation,\u201d he said. \u201cAll over the world, they\u2019re talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Trump added after some in the audience chuckled.\n\nLightfoot offered support for Johnson in a statement issued after Trump's speech, adding that the president \"knows as much about policing as he does running a fair and transparent government.\"\n\n\"It's no surprise that @realDonaldTrump brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago,\" Lightfoot tweeted. Luckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone \u2014 no matter how high the office \u2014 denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city.\n\n\"Rather than belittle Chicago's communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate,\" she added.\n\nIt's no surprise that @realDonaldTrump brought his insulting, ignorant buffoonery to Chicago. Luckily, in this city, we know the truth and we will not let anyone \u2014 no matter how high the office \u2014 denigrate who we are as a people or our status as a welcoming city. \u2014 Mayor Lori Lightfoot (@chicagosmayor) October 28, 2019\n\nGun violence has long plagued Chicago, with bursts of violence dominating headlines in the city and at times across the country. There have been 436 people killed in the city in 2019 as of Sunday, 46 fewer than at the same point the previous year, according to data compiled by the Chicago Tribune. The majority of those killings were shootings.\n\nTrump briefly raised the case of \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett, who claimed to have been the victim of an attack on the streets of Chicago from purported Trump supporters. City police later said that Smollett staged the incident. Trump on Monday accused Smollett of beating himself up and called the attack a \u201cscam.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump signed an executive order at the conclusion of Monday\u2019s remarks establishing a commission to consider best practices for recruiting, training and supporting law enforcement officers. The commission will also study issues of substance abuse, homelessness and mental illness.\n\nChicago has had its own issues with community-police relations. Those tensions flared most notably in the case of Laquan McDonald, the teenager who was shot 16 times by police officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014.\n\nVan Dyke was later convicted of murder in the case, and multiple officers have been fired for their alleged roles in covering up the circumstances of McDonald\u2019s death.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump, who was joined at Monday's event by Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrSchiff: Barr 'weaponizing' DOJ 'to go after the president's enemies' 'Saturday Night Live' targets Trump supporters as Alec Baldwin returns Comey: Mueller 'didn't succeed in his mission because there was inadequate transparency' MORE as well as Department of Homeland Security officials and a handful of members of Congress, began his remarks by taking a victory lap following his administration\u2019s successful military raid that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi over the weekend.\n\n\u201cIt was a tremendous weekend for our country. We killed ISIS leader al-Baghdadi,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was a sick and depraved man and now he\u2019s dead. He\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead as a doornail and he didn\u2019t die bravely, I can tell you that.\u201d\n\nTrump added that \u201canother president should have gotten\u201d Baghdadi, suggesting former President Obama was not focused on taking down the elusive figure responsible for the expansion of ISIS across Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"He should\u2019ve been killed years ago,\" Trump said. \"Another president should\u2019ve gotten him. But to me it was very important.\"\n\nUpdated at 2:26 p.m.", "description": "President Trump on Monday used his first trip to Chicago as president to tear into the city and its leadership, comparing its violence to Afghanistan and blasting officials as inept and disloyal to the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trump_102819whitehousegov.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
