REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo\n\nBoth cases are part of European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s crackdown on unlawful tax breaks offered by EU countries to multinationals that have drawn criticism for using the bloc\u2019s state aid rules to assess tax strategies commonly used by many companies.\n\nThe judgments from the Luxembourg-based General Court could determine the scope of Vestager\u2019s drive in the coming years and whether she will open more cases. Many of the countries have already tweaked their tax systems since then.\n\nVestager suffered a setback in February when the same court dismissed her decision against a Belgian tax scheme for BP, BASF and more than 30 other multinationals. Vestager did not give up and opened separate investigations of the companies this week.\n\nThe European Commission is investigating Ikea AB [IKEA.UL] and Nike Inc\u2019s (NKE.N) Dutch deals and Huhtamaki Oyi\u2019s (HUH1V.HE) Luxembourg tax ruling.\n\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland are among countries where much of their economies have been built on attracting multinationals. Ireland is fighting against an order to claw back a record 13 billion euros in back taxes from Apple.\n\nVestager in her 2015 decisions said U.S. coffee chain Starbucks had benefited from an illegal tax deal with the Dutch and the Italian-U.S. carmaker Fiat Chrysler with Luxembourg.\n\nShe said Fiat\u2019s Luxembourg unit paid \u201cnot even\u201d 0.4 million euros in corporate tax in 2014 and Starbucks\u2019 Dutch subsidiary less than 0.6 million euros.\n\nThe Commission said the companies set prices for goods and services sold between subsidiaries, known as transfer prices, that were below market rates and which artificially lowered their taxes.\n\nStarbucks criticized errors in the European Commission\u2019s assessment while Fiat denied receiving state aid. Companies can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union on points of law.\n\nThe cases are T-755/15 Luxembourg v Commission & T-759/15 Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe v Commission.\n\n($1 = 0.9083 euros)", "description": "Europe's second-highest court will rule on Sept. 24 whether Starbucks Corp has to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in Dutch back taxes and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV a similar amount to Luxembourg.", "authors": ["Foo Yun Chee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432086923&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1ZI", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
