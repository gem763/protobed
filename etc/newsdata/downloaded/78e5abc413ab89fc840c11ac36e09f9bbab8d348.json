They were familiar lines from a commentator whom The Washington Post earlier this year called \u201cthe new face of black conservatism,\u201d known for urging African Americans to \u201cwake up to the great liberal hoax.\u201d\n\nThen, more than two hours into the session held by House Oversight and Reform subcommittees on national security and civil rights and civil liberties, another hearing witness addressed Owens directly. Earlier, Owens had called it \u201chilarious\u201d that her fellow panelists did not provide specific numbers on the death toll from white supremacist violence.\n\n\u201cI just have to say that I object strenuously to your use of the word hilarious,\u201d said fellow witness Kathleen Belew, a University of Chicago professor who studies white nationalism, glancing toward the right-wing pundit two seats down. She noted Owens\u2019s response earlier this year after it was revealed that she was named as an inspiration in writings by the Christchurch, New Zealand, mass shooting suspect \u2014 a tweet from Owens that began with \u201cLOL!\u201d was panned by critics as insensitive.\n\nThe comments set off a spat broadcast later on Owens\u2019s Twitter account and among her supporters, as the conservative blasted Belew as a \u201cMade-up professor\u201d who made a \u201cSEVERE error\u201d and twisted her words.\n\n\u201cYou knew exactly what I meant when I said hilarious,\u201d Owens told Belew at the hearing. \u201cAnd you just tried to do live what the media does all the time to Republicans, to our president and to conservatives, which is try to manipulate what I said to fit your narrative.\u201d\n\nBelew\u2019s suggestion that Owens laughed at people\u2019s slaughter in Christchurch is \u201cabsolutely despicable,\u201d she said.\n\nThe exchange, tweeted by C-SPAN, came during an already contentious debate over policymakers\u2019 response to white supremacist violence: Some conservatives see political maneuvering in the discussions, while Democrats argue that the GOP and the federal government are not taking the issue seriously enough weeks after a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso. Investigators think the man accused in the case left behind a missive singling out Hispanics and speaking admiringly of the Christchurch shooting suspect, who promoted white nationalist ideas.\n\n[Candace Owens Is the New Face of Black Conservatism]\n\nRepublican lawmakers came to Owens\u2019s defense Friday, with Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.) decrying what he said was an attempt to \u201cgang up\u201d on the GOP-called witness and Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) saying Belew was behaving inappropriately. For Owens, it also provided a segue back into the skepticism she\u2019d expressed about the day\u2019s proceedings, as she repeated her belief that white nationalism would not crack her list of the top 100 problems facing black Americans. She claims liberals are ignoring problems such as \u201cfather absence,\u201d illiteracy and abortion, echoing other conservative focal points.\n\nOwens has made these arguments before, often pointing \u2014 as she did Friday \u2014 to her authority on the subject as a black woman, while her critics protest that she does not speak for the black community as a whole.\n\nThe Post\u2019s Philip Bump described her testimony at a congressional hearing this April:\n\nAsked by the House Judiciary Committee to offer testimony on the subject of hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism, Owens instead used her time at the microphone to broadly disparage Democrats in terms familiar to anyone who\u2019s heard her speeches. \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d she said in her opening statement. \u201cThe hearing today is not about white nationalism or hate crimes. It\u2019s about fearmongering, power and control. It\u2019s a preview of a Democrat 2020 election strategy, same as the Democrat 2016 election strategy.\u201d The Washington Post\n\nVarious groups have provided statistics on the impact of white supremacist violence. The Anti-Defamation League counts at least 50 people killed by \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d in the United States last year, mostly in cases linked to white supremacy. An analysis from the New America think tank says that far-right extremists \u2014 a designation that generally includes white nationalists \u2014 have killed more people in the United States than Islamic terrorists since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nBut another of the witnesses at Friday\u2019s hearing, Joshua Geltzer \u2014 a Georgetown Law professor with expertise in counterterrorism \u2014 declined to give numbers on deaths from white nationalist violence when pressed by a Republican lawmaker.\n\n\u201cCertain motivations for attacks are difficult to categorize,\u201d Geltzer said, though he referred to the comparison between different kinds of extremism after 9/11.\n\nFBI officials have said that racism is a motivator in a large share of the hundreds of domestic terrorism cases they are investigating. FBI Director Christopher A. Wray told members of Congress this year that white supremacists and other violent extremists are \u201ca persistent, pervasive threat.\u201d\n\nAnd on Friday the Department of Homeland Security released a report calling domestic terrorism a risk to the U.S. on par with foreign terrorism.\n\n\u201cIn our modern age, the continuation of racially based violent extremism, particularly violent white supremacy, is an abhorrent affront to the nation,\u201d acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan said.\n\nBelew said Friday that numbers on white supremacist attacks are hard to come by because the federal government has not been aggregating them, saying that she, too, wants the statistics.\n\nOwens called those responses \u201chilarious,\u201d holding them up as evidence that white nationalist violence is not a major issue for the United States or for American blacks.\n\n\u201cI was not referring to the subject matter that is hilarious,\u201d she said later. \u201cI said it\u2019s hilarious that we are sitting in this room today and \u2026 nobody can give us real numbers.\u201d\n\nShe also dismissed attempts to read into the accused Christchurch shooter\u2019s writings about his alleged inspirations, saying his missive also cited Nelson Mandela.\n\nBelew did not address the dispute over her criticism of Owens\u2019s phrasing in an email to The Post, saying only that she studies \u201cwhite power\u201d violence because she believes it is a \u201chuge social problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis topic deserves our attention [and] our good-faith efforts,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nFBI faces skepticism over its efforts against domestic terrorism\n\nMost Americans disagree with Candace Owens: They see hateful rhetoric on the rise\n\nTrump says he could end Afghanistan war quickly but \u2018tens of millions\u2019 of people would die", "description": "\"You just tried to do live what the media does all the time to Republicans, to our president and to conservatives, which is try to manipulate what I said,\" Owens told the professor who criticized her.", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/S_JNlVMKmqpnGaKN2VkwvAqCgz4=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-20-2019/t_4ccad58e0c604f9daa03d38672a3ab45_name_20190920_Owens_White_Supremacy_Still.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
