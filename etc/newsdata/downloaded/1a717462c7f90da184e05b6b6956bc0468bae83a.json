The amount of people watching every game and supporting us in Japan has been amazing.\"\n\nLong queues for replica shirts and endless repeats of Japan's wins on TV are testament to the growing excitement around the team.\n\nHowever, they remain heavy underdogs against an imposing South Africa side, who have set out to bully the Japanese with their massive pack and by naming six forwards among their eight replacements on the bench.\n\n\"I think I'll definitely lose if I go head-on,\" conceded scrumhalf Yutaka Nagare.\n\n\"I have to use my technique given I'm small. The try (Finn) Russell scored in the Scotland game started off with my mistake so I really felt responsible, and I feel they'll look to attack me in the next game, as well as near the try-line.\n\n\"But I've decided to go in determined to play with pride for this team. I'll keep my mind strong. I'll take them on carrying both mind and technique.\"\n\nJapan's ultra-fast, accurate handling and lightning pace created four highlight-reel tries against Scotland as they won 28-21 to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.\n\nSouth Africa defence coach Jacques Nienaber said it was a \"nice challenge\" to work out how to nullify the attacking threat of a side crafted by former All Black Joseph.\n\n\"They play a certain style and to their strengths, and they utilise their wings a lot. Their wings won't typically stay on their sides so the style would incorporate them in attack on both sides - they both work off their touchlines,\" he said.\n\n\"But again it does pose weaknesses as well. If you concede turnovers and both your wingers are on one edge, it means you don't have pace on the other edge.\n\n\"So, it does have its benefits. But, like in anything in rugby, for any benefit there is also a counter.\"\n\nWales, meanwhile, start as favourites against a mercurial French side which has shown flashes of brilliance among periods of mediocrity.\n\nAt the back of their minds will be the stinging defeat eight years ago, when Sam Warburton's early red card ultimately put paid to their hopes of reaching the final for the first time.\n\n\"The worst memory is the World Cup semi-final in 2011,\" said outgoing coach Warren Gatland, when asked about Wales' games with France.\n\n\"The best memory? I'm just trying to think... this Sunday?\"\n\nTeams:\n\nJapan\n\n15 Ryohei Yamanaka, 14 Kotaro Matsushima, 13 Timothy Lafaele, 12 Ryoto Nakamura, 11 Kenki Fukuoka, 10 Yu Tamura, 9 Yutaka Nagare, 8 Kazuki Himeno, 7 Lappies Labuschagne, 6 Michael Leitch (captain), 5 James Moore, 4 Luke Thompson, 3 Koo Ji-won, 2 Shota Horie, 1 Keita Inagaki\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Atsushi Sakate, 17 Isileli Nakajima, 18 Asaeli Ai Valu, 19 Wimpie van der Walt, 20 Amanaki Lelei Mafi, 21 Fumiaki Tanaka, 22 Rikiya Matsuda, 23 Lomano Lava Lemeki\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn", "description": "Millions of home fans will tune in on Sunday as hosts Japan bid to extend their Rugby World Cup fairy tale in a historic quarter-final against South Africa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7923/11153f0fd512436fa3c2d3d3b9e269b5.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
