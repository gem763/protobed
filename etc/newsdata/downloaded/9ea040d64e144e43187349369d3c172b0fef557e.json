These are our top picks and why we chose them, abridged for easy reading. Or feel free to scroll down for full review of all 11 services that we tested.\n\nHome Chef \u2014 Best Overall\n\nThe best meal kit subscription delivery service for you is probably Home Chef.\n\nHigh-quality ingredients, well-written recipes, and fantastic flavors make the Home Chef experience one you\u2019ll want to integrate into your weeknights\u2014and the service\u2019s organization makes it incredibly easy to do so. You may just impress yourself with how good your Home Chef meals turn out.\n\nSee Home Chef's plans and pricing\n\nPlated \u2014 Best for Families\n\nWhether you\u2019re cooking for picky eaters or need a plan that fits into your busy schedule, Plated can probably help you. The service\u2019s large portions, huge recipe variety, and cook time accuracy make it our top choice for families\u2014or those of us who love to have leftovers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSee Plated's plans and pricing\n\nSun Basket \u2014 Best for Vegetarians\n\nWhile not an entirely vegetarian service, Sun Basket offers a huge variety of quick, flavorful plant-based meals that will satisfy vegetarians and omnivores alike. Their ingredients are largely organic, and their recipes are some of the fastest we tested.\n\nSee Sun Basket's plans and pricing\n\nEcommerce giant Amazon now offers their meal kits through Amazon Fresh, a grocery delivery service available to Prime members in certain metro areas across the country. The kit's fresh Whole Foods ingredients and flexible delivery make it one of the best we've tested, despite a lack of meal variety.\n\nSee Amazon's plans and pricing\n\nMeal kit veteran HelloFresh featured our very favorite recipe of the entire experience and earned high marks for flavor overall. While their recipes weren\u2019t always quick to make, I always had fun in the process.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSee HelloFresh's plans and pricing\n\nPrice / serving (2 people) $9.95 $11.95 $11.99 $8.99 $10.25 Price / serving (4 people) $9.95 $9.95 $10.99 $7.49 $8.90 Gluten-free options* \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Vegetarian options* \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Vegan options* \u2714 \u2718 \u2714 \u2718 \u2714 Nut-free options* \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Dairy-free options* \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 Meals offered / week 16 20 18 17 10 Time to table 45 44 40 46 50\n\n* NOTE: The service offers at least two options of this dietary preference each week.\n\nCredit: Home Chef / Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Home Chef has great flavors, the best recipes, and tons of options.\n\nBest Overall\u2014Home Chef\n\nCost: Visit Home Chef for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $9.95 per serving, regardless of frequency or quantity. Meals can serve 2, 4, or 6 people.\n\nFavorite meal: Farmhouse Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes, Green Onion Gravy, and Corn\n\nLike its name suggests, Home Chef provides customers with the tools necessary to become true masters of the kitchen. From Home Chef\u2019s fresh, high-quality ingredients to well-written recipes that break down intimidating cooking methods into digestible steps, everything about this service made me feel like I was preparing restaurant-worthy (or at least guest-worthy) meals without running around like a maniac. Home Chef now offers oven-ready meals and the option to swap out proteins, making it appealing to an even wider swath of busy cooks.\n\nHome Chef's fried chicken recipe came out great. I could hardly believe I did it myself.\n\nTake Home Chef\u2019s Farmhouse Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes, Green Onion Gravy, and Corn. While browsing for meals on the company\u2019s website, I initially saw fried chicken and laughed. How could a food so many people find impossible to cook at home be executed well in the context of a meal kit? I was shocked\u2014and thrilled!\u2014to find that Home Chef\u2019s recipe yielded wonderfully even, juicy chicken with nary an oil burn in sight. I could hardly believe I did it myself.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf the words \u201cfried chicken\u201d make you clutch your heart in health-related fear, don\u2019t worry\u2014Home Chef\u2019s offerings are diverse enough to accommodate almost any diet, including vegetarians and vegans. It offers 16 dinner options per week, as well as a handful of lunch and snack choices as add-ons to its main menu. I was impressed by the depth of flavor in the Yang-Yang Beef with Shishito Peppers, a lighter alternative to traditional American Chinese food, and loved the Hot Honey Salmon with Zucchini and Tomatoes for its summer simplicity. Vegetarian meals, like the Wild Rice and Brussels Sprouts Harvest Bowl, were on the table in less than 30 minutes.\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Most Home Chef meals I tested, like the Wild Rice and Brussels Sprouts Harvest Bowl, were restaurant-worthy creations.\n\nAt the heart of Home Chef\u2019s success is its organization. Any experienced cook knows that preparation is half the battle, and this company knows it, too. Ingredients are divided per meal into labeled bags that easily slide into the fridge, recipe instructions are consistently clear, time estimates are largely accurate, and the website is easy to navigate, allowing you the freedom to choose meals and skip delivery weeks at will. This clarity and organization made for faster fridge-to-table times than a lot of the competition and saved me the stress of forgetting ingredients and re-reading recipes four times over.\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar Home Chef's organization and labeled meal bags made finding the ingredients I needed very simple, saving me time in the long run.\n\nHome Chef would be wise to incorporate more biodegradable packaging into their existing model, but I struggle to find any other criticism of this excellent service. We liked it so much, we've partnered with Home Chef to offer Reviewed readers $20 off their first 4 orders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVisit HomeChef.com\n\nCredit: Plated / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen With great variety and flexible plans, Plated is perfect for families.\n\nBest for Families\u2014Plated\n\nCost: Visit Plated.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $11.95 per serving for 2 people, $9.95 per serving for 3 to 4 people, regardless of frequency. Different plans are available.\n\nFavorite meal: Beef and Grape Tomato Rag\u00f9 Over Summer Squash Noodles\n\nIf you\u2019ve got four or more people to feed, including picky eaters and those who always go back for seconds, Plated is our choice for you. With 20 different meals to choose from each week, this service has both the largest menu and some of the largest portions I saw among all the meal kits I tested, making it great for families.\n\nPlated meals are filling without being heavy, and while many rely on a traditional meat, grain, and veggie combination, at least three meals a week are entirely vegetarian. In my testing, I was impressed by how quickly dinners like Crunchy Pork Milanese with Honey Mustard and Arugula came together\u2014and while the flavors were often not as complex as those of the competition, they were always strong, and never bland. This is great news for parents who want to eat well, but don\u2019t want to bother preparing meals their kids won\u2019t enjoy, too.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother reason Plated is great for families? It has extremely flexible policies when skipping a delivery, changing delivery days, and altering meal boxes, making it easier for you to fit them into your family\u2019s hectic schedule. Unfortunately, their packaging is plastic-heavy\u2014so extremely eco-friendly customers may want to look elsewhere\u2014but packaging is a consistent issue with most meal kit services that has yet be solved entirely.\n\nVisit Plated.com\n\nCredit: Sun Basket / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen Sun Basket has a large menu and easy recipes, but it's hard to cancel.\n\nBest for Vegetarians\u2014Sun Basket\n\nCost: Visit SunBasket.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $11.99 per serving for 2 people, $10.99 per serving for 4 people, regardless of frequency. Different plans are available.\n\nFavorite meal: Chicken Yakitori with Broccoli and Rice\n\nAlthough Sun Basket isn\u2019t only for vegetarians, the organic service offers a wide variety of unique, meat-free meals that will satisfy vegetarians and vegan customers alike. Fast Mediterranean Flatbreads with Beet Salad and Skordalia and Simple Tempeh Curry Stir-Fry with Black Rice were among its current vegan offerings when we put this story together. And Sun Basket makes a great alternative to Purple Carrot, the vegan meal kit service that I had a number of issues with during testing.\n\nI was impressed by how easily my Sun Basket meals came together, relying on just a few key ingredients and spice blends to do most of the heavy lifting, which meant spending less time cooking and more time enjoying my food with my boyfriend. Sun Basket now offers oven-ready and pre-prepped meals we have yet to test. Sun Basket\u2019s meals also lean heavily into South and East Asian flavors, but this is partly why it\u2019s such a strong service for vegetarians\u2014it tends to avoid the carb-centric dinners that are so often the only options for people who avoid meat.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a reformed vegetarian, Sun Basket\u2019s omnivore meals were still my favorite\u2014Chicken Yakitori with Broccoli and Rice and Quick Curried Beef Khow Suey with Ramen Noodles were simple, filling meals that took about 30 minutes to prepare. Some flavors, such as the khow suey or salam spice, could have been stronger to distinguish dishes from one another.\n\nMy one issue with Sun Basket? Their cancellation policy is the worst I\u2019ve seen, requiring you to call an impossible-to-find number and speak to a customer service representative rather than emailing or clicking a button on your account. It\u2019s a dishonest, unhelpful way to retain customers and I hope they do away with it soon.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that while Sun Basket\u2019s ingredients are largely organic, the company is not certified organic like Green Chef, meaning it can swap in non-organic ingredients when necessary and offer a consistently large menu. In high school and early college, I worked at an organic juice bar and cafe that similarly forwent organic certification for a larger menu. It\u2019s a trade-off that I was (and am) willing to make for variety and high-quality food year-round, but devout organic eaters may not be interested in a service that lacks certification.\n\nVisit SunBasket.com\n\nHow We Tested\n\nThe Tester\n\nI\u2019m Cassidy Olsen, and I love to cook\u2014so much so that I write about it for a living! But because I\u2019m young, busy, and new to the nine-to-five life, making a proper dinner for myself each night can still be daunting. Sometimes I\u2019ll have bursts of motivation and bookmark 10 different New York Times Cooking recipes for myself, but most of the time I don\u2019t have the creative energy (or regular energy) to go shopping for new meals and actually make them. Also, trying new recipes can be flat-out hard! As much as I love cooking, I\u2019m no expert, and I don\u2019t want a bunch of expensive ingredients to go to waste because I wasn\u2019t sure what I was doing.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m the perfect candidate for testing meal kit delivery services. I have the cooking and food knowledge to know what works, but the attitude of a very tired person who craves convenience and simplicity. My boyfriend also conveniently loves to eat and not go grocery shopping, so he acted as a second tester when it came to reviewing the meals themselves.\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar I made over 40 dinners from 11 different meal kit delivery services\u2014and have the recipe cards to prove it.\n\nThe Tests\n\nAfter testing the most popular meal kit delivery services on the market back in 2016, we recently decided our rankings might need an overhaul\u2014in two years, many services have grown to cater to more diets, prices have largely fallen, and new competition has emerged. So, I re-tested all the existing contenders along with some new entries that were growing in popularity, including celebrity chef-approved services Martha and Marley Spoon and Chef\u2019d.\n\nDuring our testing, Chef\u2019d was acquired by True Food Innovation and rolled into their True Chef meal kit service\u2014and since True Chef doesn\u2019t deliver nationally, I left it out of our final ranking. That same reason is why we omitted new services like AmazonFresh that are still in beta or only deliver to certain markets. We also didn\u2019t test services like Veestro that deliver pre-prepared meals instead of true meal kits.\n\nCredit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar I tested meal kits across three months in three different kitchens, all with my own cookware.\n\nFor each service, I ordered one box of three, two-serving meals through their website just like a regular customer, choosing a diverse variety of meals when available. I prepared each meal on a weeknight for myself and my boyfriend and evaluated for quality of ingredients, recipe accuracy and variety, difficulty, speed, cleanup, taste, and more.\n\nI also considered cost, how eco-friendly and user-friendly the kit\u2019s packaging was, and how easy (or difficult) it was to cancel the service after we were done testing. I scored and compared each meal in a large spreadsheet and kept detailed notes in an accompanying document like a true food nerd. I also re-tested our winner, Home Chef, to make sure they were deserving of the title.\n\nWhat You Should Know About Meal Kits\n\nEven if you\u2019ve already decided which meal kit delivery service is right for you, chances are you\u2019re still confused about what your first box actually entails. While each service has different approaches to ordering, packaging, and delivery, I\u2019ve found that most services have some baseline similarities.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a discount on your first box. Almost every service we tried offers a large discount on the first box. While this is an awesome benefit for new customers, don\u2019t let it fool you into thinking one service is much cheaper than the others. Our price breakdown for each service reflects the price you\u2019ll be regularly paying per meal, disregarding initial discounts. Your box is good to sit on your doorstep until the end of the day. Because delivery windows for these services are as broad as a full day, they package ingredients to last outside your actual refrigerator until the end of the day (i.e. when you get home from work and errands). Most often, produce and dry ingredients will be grouped in bags above ice packs, and any meat will be fully insulated below ice packs. The packaging is going to be bulky and cumbersome. As much as certain services pride themselves on eco-friendly boxes, there\u2019s no way around the massive amounts of packaging that go into meal kit delivery. Disposing of the large, insulated cardboard boxes and ice packs can be a hassle, and you need to stay on top of them lest you develop a small mountain in some corner of your home. Because I moved apartments mid-testing, I was already surrounded by cardboard and trash from new furniture, so I incorporated the boxes into my regular dumpster and recycling runs. Recipes are usually seasonal, but favorites are often repeated. Every meal kit service has a different approach to repeating meals, but most try to make recipes as seasonal as possible to keep you from getting bored and to guarantee fresh, sustainable produce. That being said, most companies make note of their most popular meals and offer them many weeks a year, regardless of season. If you really love one of your meals, hold onto the recipe card for future reference so you can request it again\u2014or make it yourself using store-bought ingredients. Cook your meals soon after receiving them. Meal kit ingredients are typically fresh and high-quality, but there\u2019s nothing special preserving them\u2014they\u2019re just like what you buy from the grocery store. Because of transit times, they might actually be older than what you buy from the store! That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to give them priority in your fridge and cook them as soon as possible. Use common sense when approaching certain dishes\u2014seafood, fresh greens, and chicken should be prepared first, while red meat, pork, and harder produce can last a few more days. Freeze any meat you won\u2019t be eating in the first few days after receiving your box. Cancel at least one full week before you want your last box. Most meal kit companies have solid customer service and flexible cancellation policies, but it\u2019s important to consider the long-term logistics that go into assembling your box. If you\u2019re interested in canceling your subscription, make sure to do it at least one full week before you want your last box. If you want to skip a week or take a break from deliveries, most services allow you to make those selections, too. Many meal kits are now offered in grocery stores. To combat the high operational costs of delivery-only services, many meal kit companies have partnered with (or been acquired by) major food stores and are now offering their kits in the grocery aisles. While we only tested delivery services, many of the recipes we tried are also available in stores for equal or lower prices. If you\u2019re curious to try a meal before you subscribe to a service, or you\u2019re willing to regularly visit the grocery store for your meal kits, these are good options at your local chains like Stop & Shop, Safeway, and Kroger. Some meal kit companies now offer pre-prepared and heat-and-eat meals. We've noticed a recent trend toward speed and convenience in the meal kit world, both with traditional companies like the ones we've tested in this roundup and with frozen and ready-to-eat brands. Home Chef now offers at least one oven-ready meal per menu every week, and Sun Basket has introduced both oven-ready and pre-prepped options. We haven't tested these options yet, so we can't speak to their quality\u2014but if you need to spend as little time cooking as possible, keep an eye out for these offerings.\n\nBefore you order, you\u2019ll also want to make sure you have some essential cooking tools at the ready. Here are our recommendations:\n\nI would also recommend having a good cast iron pan or a Dutch oven handy, although I never needed to use both together for any meal kit dinner. If you\u2019re entirely new to cooking and meal kits are just your gateway into the kitchen, these tools will be all you need to prepare amazing meals for many years to come.\n\nOther Meal Kit Services We Tested\n\nThough we feel that our top picks should satisfy most people, the competition has some benefits, too. Here are our reviews of the other meal kit delivery services that we tested.\n\nCredit: Amazon / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen Amazon has great recipes and a flexible plan, but a limited menu.\n\nAmazon\n\nCost: Visit Amazon for updated pricing. When tested, meals were between $7.99 and $9.99 per serving for 2 people.\n\nFavorite meal: Falafel Patties with Tomato & Sumac Salad\n\nIf you\u2019re an Amazon Prime member who also subscribes to the AmazonFresh add-on, you\u2019re eligible to have Amazon meal kits delivered right to your door. Unlike most meal kit subscription boxes, this service isn\u2019t pre-scheduled, pre-fixed, or heavily packaged. That\u2019s because AmazonFresh subscribers can schedule delivery of their products whenever they\u2019d like, down to the hour, thanks to the company\u2019s partnership with Whole Foods.\n\nOn the surface, Amazon meal kits are much less expensive than comparable meals from other subscription services. When you factor in the cost of Amazon Prime and AmazonFresh, however, you start to see how the e-commerce giant can offer meal kits for such seemingly low prices. Amazon Prime currently costs $99 per year, and AmazonFresh is $14.99 per month, which adds up to just under $280 per year for the ability to even buy these meal kits. That cost quickly makes up for the $3 in savings per meal.\n\nDespite my initial skepticism about Amazon\u2019s ability to package fresh and tasty meal kits, I\u2019m happy to report that every meal I made throughout the week was quick, simple, and flavorful. The Petite Tender Steak with Truffle Butter and Garlic-Chive Potatoes came out rich and well-cooked, and the Chicken Parmigiana with Pesto Farafelle and Caprese Salad was crispy and comforting, with leftovers to spare.\n\nI believe this success is in large part due to the high-quality ingredients Amazon is able to source through Whole Foods and its other partners. Save for some wilted, browned herbs, every ingredient in my box seemed incredibly fresh. Amazon also pre-preps and pre-chops more ingredients than most other meal kit delivery services, which help keep cook times accurate and under 30 minutes.\n\nAmazon\u2019s recipes are also successful because they aren\u2019t very experimental\u2014they rely on flavor combinations you already know and love. Italian food, steak and potatoes, Mediterranean platters, salmon and veggies, and curry and rice are probably all very familiar to you, and they just require quality ingredients to make them work.\n\nOther meal kits have introduced much greater variety and more interesting recipes to keep customers invested, whereas Amazon is playing it safe and assuming you\u2019re hungry. It\u2019s up to you to decide which one is more appealing.\n\nVisit Amazon\n\nCredit: HelloFresh / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen HelloFresh has great flavors and fun recipes that are easy to learn.\n\nHelloFresh\n\nCost: Visit HelloFresh.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $8.99 per serving for 2 people ordering at least 3 meals a week, $7.49 per serving for 3+ people ordering at least 3 meals a week. Different plans are available.\n\nFavorite meal: B\u00e1nh Mi Burgers with Vietnamese-style Lemongrass Pork and Sriracha Mayo\n\nThe wallet-friendly HelloFresh is the market\u2019s biggest name after Blue Apron, and it\u2019s easy to see why\u2014big portions, affordable prices, and straightforward recipes make the service incredibly approachable. Although I found that HelloFresh meals were rarely on the table in the 30 or so minutes the recipe cards promised, I was consistently impressed by the flavor. Its B\u00e1nh Mi Burger, which puts an American twist on the classic Vietnamese sandwich with lightly pickled veggies and sriracha mayo, is absolutely out of this world\u2014it\u2019s by far my favorite meal of testing, and it\u2019s the only meal kit recipe I\u2019ve made again for myself.\n\nWhile HelloFresh offers more variety in their meals than it was two years ago, it still doesn\u2019t have consistent vegan offerings, and it struggles with clarity and ease-of-use on their website\u2014I accidentally selected a \u201cpremium meal\u201d of Balsamic Nectarine Duck Breasts and was surprised to find a second invoice for the price difference in my inbox.\n\nHowever, changes in these areas might be coming in the future\u2014HelloFresh acquired certified organic and gluten-free service Green Chef in March, which could help them provide more reasonably-priced options for those following organic, vegan, gluten-free, paleo, and keto diets. A spokesperson for the company said that there are \"no expected changes to HelloFresh or Green Chef anywhere in the near future.\"\n\nVisit HelloFresh.com\n\nCredit: Martha and Marley Spoon / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen Marley Spoon is eco-friendly and unique, but portions are small.\n\nMartha and Marley Spoon\n\nCost: Visit MarleySpoon.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $10.25 per serving for 2 people ordering 3 meals a week, $8.89 per serving for 4 people ordering at least 3 meals a week. Different plans are available.\n\nFavorite meal: Chipotle-Spiced Steak with Potato Salad and Charred Snap Peas\n\nThe oddly-named Martha and Marley Spoon is actually a partnership between German meal kit company Marley Spoon and lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart\u2014and her influence over the brand is evident. Meals like Chipotle-Spiced Steak with Potato Salad and Charred Snap Peas and Garlicky Chicken with Dilly Beans and Corn on the Cob are simple, sophisticated, and downright American, just like the homemaking queen.\n\nWhile I was consistently impressed by the flavor and inventiveness of Martha and Marley Spoon\u2019s side dishes, I found less to celebrate in the mains, which were typically plain animal proteins. The service is also far from ideal for those with dietary restrictions\u2014in typical American fashion, every recipe revolves around an animal protein or heavy carbs. To keep calories from spinning out of control, most Martha and Marley Spoon meals have smaller portions than those from other services. Oddly, this service is one of the only ones we tested that doesn\u2019t publically archive their recipes online to access at any time.\n\nThe service did score points with me for its eco-friendly packaging, made almost entirely from biodegradable materials. Most of its recipes were also easy to follow for new cooks. If you\u2019re looking for meals with classic American flavors and high-quality ingredients, Martha and Marley Spoon might be a good option for you. Want to learn more? Read my full review of Martha and Marley Spoon.\n\nVisit MarleySpoon.com\n\nCredit: Blue Apron / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen Blue Apron has very easy recipes, but they lack flavor and depth.\n\nBlue Apron\n\nCost: Visit BlueApron.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $9.99 per serving for 2 people, $7.99 per serving for 4 people ordering 3 meals a week. Different plans are available.\n\nFavorite meal: Crispy Cheese Quesadillas with Poblano Pepper and Queso Blanco\n\nDespite the success of its competition, the original meal kit service Blue Apron still has some fight left in them. Time and experience has allowed Blue Apron to keep prices low, perfect time estimates on recipes, and offer fun wine-pairing and gift options.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like some of that time would be better spent on diversifying its menu and making recipes taste better. In my testing, I had consistent problems with flavors and ratios being off\u2014oregano overpowered orecchiette, jalapeno overwhelmed peach salsa, and my polenta was in desperate need of salt, spice, or anything to make it more than a bland mush. My favorite meal of the bunch was a simple quesadilla that really didn\u2019t require a recipe. With only eight meal options per week, Blue Apron also offers one of the smallest menus of any service.\n\nI appreciate how easy and quick my Blue Apron meals were to make, but disorganized packaging, limited menus, and recipes riddled with problems are preventing me from awarding the classic service a higher ranking.\n\nVisit BlueApron.com\n\nCredit: Terra's Kitchen / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen Terra's Kitchen has fast recipes, but odd packaging and bland flavor.\n\nTerra\u2019s Kitchen\n\nCost: Visit TerrasKitchen.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $9.99 to $17.99 per serving, depending on the meal. Minimum order is $63.49 per vessel.\n\nFavorite meal: Bacon, Kale and Caramelized Onion Pasta Bowl\n\nWith an eye toward sustainability, Terra\u2019s Kitchen ships customers their meal kits in a large, reusable vessel that\u2019s designed to be picked up and returned the next business day following delivery. While this practice is eco-friendly in theory, I found every other aspect of the company\u2019s packaging to be disorganized and plastic-heavy, which outweighs any good that comes from the reusable nature of the vessel.\n\nFirst, there are no clear directions about how to return the vessel evident on the package itself, which led me to miss my first pick-up attempts\u2014that\u2019s a lot of wasted fossil fuel. Second, all the smaller containers within the vessel are made of single-use plastic and aren\u2019t organized by meal, which led to a lot of scrambling around in the fridge trying to find the right ingredients for each meal.\n\nAnother point of pride for Terra\u2019s Kitchen is its pre-chopped ingredients, which are designed to save customers a lot of time and hassle when cooking. While this certainly helped me get meals on the table faster, I\u2019m skeptical of pre-chopped vegetables for a lot of reasons, including shorter shelf life, loss of nutrients, and potential for contamination. I don\u2019t mind taking the time to chop a carrot\u2014I would prefer to save time with more organized meal bags.\n\nThe meals themselves were very easy and fairly tasty, but wholly unremarkable. Terra\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s packaging problems, compounded by a cluttered website full of meals that vary wildly in price, far outweigh the service\u2019s convenience in my book. However, those with limited mobility or difficulty using their hands may find their pre-chopped ingredients to be a lifesaver.\n\nVisit TerrasKitchen.com\n\nCredit: Green Chef / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen Green Chef's menus are healthy, but oddly restrictive.\n\nGreen Chef\n\nCost: Visit GreenChef.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $10.49 to $14.99 per serving, depending on your plan.\n\nFavorite meal: Sweet Potato and Mushroom Tacos with Cotija Cheese Crisps and Slaw\n\nOur former top pick for meal kits, Green Chef, didn\u2019t impress me the way it did our previous reviewer. Like Sun Basket, Green Chef promises organic ingredients, certified gluten-free meals, and health-minded recipes for all types of diets\u2014however, this service\u2019s plans are much more restrictive, only allowing you to choose from a handful of meals per week.\n\nThis is likely due in part to Green Chef\u2019s status as certified organic, meaning that every single ingredient they include in their meal kits is organic, with no exceptions. While this is great news for people who abide by strict organic diets, it\u2019s rather limiting in the scope of food that Green Chef can consistently provide to its customers for a reasonable price\u2014it can be hard to source many organic ingredients year-round. Sun Basket, on the other hand, is not certified organic, meaning they can offer a larger menu and swap in non-organic ingredients when organic simply isn\u2019t available. As I wrote before, it\u2019s a trade-off that I\u2019m willing to make for variety, but devout organic eaters may prefer the limited menu if it means certified organic ingredients.\n\nAs someone who will eat anything and everything, I originally chose Green Chef\u2019s \u201comnivore\u201d plan but noticed that the gluten-free meals that week were more appealing and opted into that plan instead. While I received an email about a \u201cone-time change to my plan\u201d in my inbox that afternoon, I had to go hunting for a receipt to find that there was an extra charge for going gluten-free. These sneaky price differences can be confusing for users who just want the meals that sound the best to them, not the ones Green Chef decides they should be eating.\n\nThe flavor profiles of most meals were all over the place\u2014mixing Thai with Southwestern and so on\u2014and some directions were clearly incorrect on one of the recipe cards. However, all of the meals tasted just fine in the end.\n\nAs Green Chef was acquired by HelloFresh in March, it\u2019s a possibility that they may soon have the resources to broaden their menu and offer better, more consistent recipes, but these changes are necessary before I would recommend them to a friend.\n\nVisit GreenChef.com\n\nCredit: Purple Carrot / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen Purple Carrot's recipes are often inaccurate and bland in flavor.\n\nPurple Carrot\n\nCost: Visit PurpleCarrot.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were $12.00 per serving, fixed. Different plans are available.\n\nFavorite meal: Japanese Bento Box with Miso-Glazed Tofu and Yu Choy\n\nI wanted to love Purple Carrot, I really did. Sadly, my experience with this vegan service was riddled with confusing recipes, bland flavors, missing ingredients, and altogether bad meals.\n\nAlthough I typically eat meat, I was a vegetarian for a period of my life and regularly enjoy vegan meals with my friends, so this isn\u2019t coming from someone who needs to always eat animal products. I truly hated two out of the three meals I received from Purple Carrot\u2014specifically, the Buffalo Cauliflower Salad with Farro and Ranch Dressing, and the Chilaquiles Salsa Verde with Tomatillos and Black Beans. The salad involved an entire head of lettuce and only a handful of spicy cauliflower pieces tossed together with a bit of ranch, an overwhelmingly bland, damp meal that left me hungry.\n\nThe chilaquiles\u2014the recipe for which instructed me to blend hot, raw onion and tomato puree in a hand blender\u2014was difficult to make and nearly-inedible in the end thanks to its overpowering onion flavor and soggy tortillas. The redeeming meal of the bunch, a Japanese Bento Box with Miso-Glazed Tofu and Yu Choy, severely lacked texture, as well as one of its central ingredients, yu choy, which was unceremoniously replaced with broccoli in my box.\n\nThese meals actually felt like what a huge carnivore imagines vegan eating to be like\u2014mushy, bland, and calorie-deficient. I know for a fact that vegan meals can (and should!) have more flavor and texture than any of these dishes did.\n\nVisit PurpleCarrot.com\n\nCredit: Purple Carrot / Reviewed / Cassidy Olsen Purple Carrot's recipes are often inaccurate and bland in flavor.\n\nPeach Dish\n\nCost: Visit PeachDish.com for updated pricing. When tested, meals were around $12.50 per serving, although prices vary per meal\n\nFavorite meal: Kevin Clark\u2019s Comfy Chicken\n\nIf it isn\u2019t evident by its name, Peach Dish is the Southern comfort food-themed meal kit that claims to bring authentic Southern recipes to your doorstep each week. While I\u2019m no expert when it comes to food from the American South, it\u2019s hard to tell who exactly this meal kit is for. Even non-Southerners can tell that most of the service\u2019s recipes\u2014like Turkey Mushroom Burgers and Italian Wedding Soup\u2014aren\u2019t very Southern, and out-of-towners like me aren\u2019t likely to find the richness of the actual Southern recipes like Chicken and Dumplings to be appealing on a weekly basis.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s a confusing meal kit with time-consuming recipes that are simply too much for regular cooking. Too much butter, too much milk, and too much flour in most recipes for health-minded people to enjoy, yet not enough flavor to make the indulgence worth it. With only eight meals offered per week, variety is also hard to come by, so I ended up with two creamy chicken dishes and a shrimp pasta bowl in my box.\n\nWhile none of my meals were inedible, I felt crampy after eating the leftovers from the shrimp dish and noticed that some of the milk provided had spoiled within four days of delivery. Peach Dish was very responsive to my concerns and assured me that their food is always held to high standards and packaged to survive transportation, so it\u2019s likely my illness was just due to the richness of the food not agreeing with me\u2014but it was an unfortunate end to my testing.\n\nVisit PeachDish.com\n\nMore Articles You Might Enjoy", "description": "From Blue Apron to Home Chef, we tested eleven of the most popular meal kit food delivery subscriptions available.
