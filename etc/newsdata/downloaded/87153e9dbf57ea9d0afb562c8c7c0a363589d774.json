Known as \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d he lived in the U.S. illegally in during the 1980s and served three years in prison there for selling drugs before being deported back to Mexico in 1997.\n\nHe is currently among the DEA\u2019s \u201cmost wanted\u201d fugitives, with a $10 million bounty on his head.\n\nREAD: These were El Chapo's final words before being shipped off to supermax\n\n\u201cThey are very violent,\u201d Kyle Mori, the DEA agent leading the charge to capture Oseguera, told Univision this week. \u201cDecapitations, dissolving bodies in acid, public executions, ripping out the heart, killing women and children, bombings against people. It happens almost every day. El Chapo was violent, but El Mencho has taken it to a new level.\u201d\n\nIn August the cartel hung nine bodies from a bridge in Michoacan state and dumped 10 more bodies nearby. The group hung a banner next to the bodies that read: \u201cLovely people. Carry on with your day.\u201d\n\nCover: A charred truck that belong to Michoacan state police stands on the roadside after it was burned during an attack in El Aguaje, Mexico, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.
