They were put in long-term storage in case their cancer ever returned.\n\n\"One of the freezer's sensors failed and the notification process ... failed and so we lost those specimens,\" said Dr. James Stein, CHLA's Chief Medical Officer.\n\nAll but one patient had gone through initial therapy, the Los Angeles Times reported. The loss of stem cells hasn't jeopardized any of the children's health, the hospital said.\n\nThe hospital also bungled the notification of families. A letter breaking the news was accidentally addressed to the children and not their parents.\n\nSean Anderson Corona, 13, described the news as \"painful\" and broke into tears.\n\n\"I got almost to the very bottom [of the letter] and I just started crying,\" he told KABC-TV.\n\nCorona underwent stem cell therapy after being diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma. The grueling process required him to be hooked up to machines for hours. His blood was then reinfused back into his body once the stem cells were harvested.\n\n\u201cI would try to sleep and my body would just start shaking, and then I just started to freak out and I\u2019d start crying,\u201d said Corona, who will have been cancer-free for three years in November.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nStein said patients can always have the stem cells harvested again. In a statement, the hospital apologized for the mishap.\n\n\"We are very sorry that this loss occurred,\" it read. \"We apologize for any distress or confusion that this has caused our patients and their families.\"\n\nIt said the freezer was replaced and the system that monitors the sensors has been upgraded.", "description": "Stem\u00a0cells harvested\u00a0from the blood of 56 Los Angeles-area child cancer patients were lost when the hospital freezer where they were stored\u00a0malfunctioned, administrators said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/e3f9b79b-Capture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
