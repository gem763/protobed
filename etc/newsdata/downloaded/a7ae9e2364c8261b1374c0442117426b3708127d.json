A spokesperson for the company emailed me and three other Motherboard writers with a link to a blog post that doesn\u2019t deny any part of our article but attempts to spin the lobbying as innocent: \u201cJason: I noticed you tweeted the story from yesterday and wanted to make sure you had this blog. There are some facts in here that are important, so I wanted you to know.\u201d\n\nThis is relatively normal public relations behavior: Companies often try to spin stories that are perceived as negative as being blown out of proportion or somehow incorrect. They often say in public that the thing they said in private\u2014in this case, the lobbying document\u2014does not mean what it clearly meant.\n\nBut Comcast not only emailed reporters at Motherboard, it also emailed reporters at at least three other publications who also tweeted our article, as well as people who merely retweeted our article. I checked with nine people who had tweeted or retweeted a link to our article. Eight of them had gotten emails from Comcast.\n\nIn that article, we attached a full copy of the slide deck that Comcast made and also quoted Comcast extensively; the slide deck explains Comcast\u2019s position on the issue at length. Experts speculated that the reason Comcast is lobbying against the plan is that Comcast wants to have the option to track its users.\n\nThis is a reasonable conclusion. In 2017, ISPs and the advertising industry lobbied Congress to kill Federal Communication Commission rules that would have prevented ISPs from selling your personal data to advertisers. And in March, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into whether ISPs are selling user browser history and personal information.\n\nThough Comcast insists that \u201cwhere you go on the internet is your business, not ours,\u201d the company admits that it does sell user information to third parties; it just says that the information does not \u201cidentify who you are to anyone.\u201d But the industry\u2019s lobbying history suggests that it does think that user data is valuable, and thus would probably want as much visibility into user behavior as is possible. Google\u2019s move would restrict some of that visibility, and so Comcast is lobbying against the move.\n\nThere is a long history of Comcast acting differently behind closed doors than it acts with the public, which is why lobbying documents are notable and should, when possible, be made available to the public. For example, during the net neutrality battle, Comcast said publicly that it would honor net neutrality principles, while lobbying against them behind the scenes. It's also worth mentioning that Comcast was specifically bound by the FCC to honor net neutrality as a condition of merging with NBC, not because it felt as though net neutrality would be the best thing for its consumers. And on the same day that the FCC announced it was repealing net neutrality rules, the company quietly deleted its public page committing itself to net neutrality principles.\n\nThis is all to say, thank you for sending us the facts, Comcast. I noticed your email and wanted to make sure you had this blog.", "description": "Comcast has spent the last day trying to tell anyone who shared an article about its lobbying efforts that the lobbying is innocent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db3480fc203ad008d17d3ce/lede/1572030832092-GettyImages-1071767096.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7493xh;0xw,0.2507xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
