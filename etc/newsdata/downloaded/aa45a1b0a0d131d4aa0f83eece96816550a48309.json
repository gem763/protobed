People pay for these companions for emotional support. The robots are indistinguishable from humans at a casual glance, and marriage laws have recently been passed allowing unions between humans and Artificials.\n\nKestrel Hathaway is devastated when she loses her baby during childbirth. On her way home from the hospital she witnesses a terrorist attack and is able to save the life of one of the bystanders. When she arrives home, she learns that her brother, who works for the company that creates the Artificials, has given her one as a gift. She returns it, but changes her mind when she realizes she needs to talk to someone about her grief.\n\nThe name of the Artificial is Jordan, and he\u2019s not like the other ones of his kind. Once he\u2019s activated, he begins to question what it means to exist. Is there a God? And does he have a soul? What constitutes a living being?\n\n\u201cSynapse\u201d isn\u2019t a retread of the Pinocchio story with the character wanting to be a real boy. It\u2019s the story of a created being that asks hard existential questions. Jordan\u2019s pursuit of answers makes the reader contemplate deep philosophical questions as well. What does it mean to be truly alive? What makes someone truly human?\n\nThe author has crafted a glimpse of a future when mankind and computer technology fully merge. He immerses the characters into a tense thriller, creating a unique and thought-provoking reading experience.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"Synapse\" (Thomas Nelson), by Steven James", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jeff Ayers"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/book_review_-_synapse_90817_c0-775-1650-1737_s1770x1032.jpg?2748beb56ba0e326bf661d15bae501af68c149d7", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
