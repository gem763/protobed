(Jeremy Daniels)\n\nMedical treatment has knocked down tumors in 6-year-old Easton Daniels\u2019s brain, but the drug that helped him also wiped out his immune system.\n\nTo bolster his immune function and help keep him healthy, he has visited a hospital for intravenous infusions of immune globulin about every month for the past year and a half.\n\nBut in July, his family was stunned by a letter from Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center: \u201cAll of Easton\u2019s appointments canceled until further notice,\u201d said his dad, Jeremy Daniels, who works in custodial services for a school.\n\nLike Cincinnati Children\u2019s, hospitals and clinics nationwide report a shortage of the medication, whose long manufacturing process starts with donated blood plasma.\n\nOften referred to as IVIG, intravenous immune globulin is used for a wide variety of medical conditions beyond those for which it was first targeted \u2014 some treatments effective and some not. It is rich in antibodies, which are proteins that help fight off infection.\n\nWith IVIG in short supply, hospitals are left to make tough choices about who receives it, setting up a type of triage, like that faced by Easton\u2019s family, who find themselves caught in a gray area over which conditions qualify. The hospital said it couldn\u2019t comment on individual cases but that it had made those with life-threatening needs a priority.\n\n\u201cIVIG can be a useful treatment for evidence-based purposes, but it\u2019s also often used as a last-chance, nothing-is-working Hail Mary kind of approach for myriad conditions even when there is not clear evidence that it helps the patient,\u201d Jerry Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said in an email. He was speaking in general, not about any specific patient.\n\nNationwide, drug shortages of all kinds \u2014 from antibiotics to heart drugs to saline solution \u2014 are increasing and having a high impact on public health, the Food and Drug Administration said in a November public meeting. They often result from manufacturing problems \u2014 such as when a factory shuts down or too few suppliers exist to meet demand.\n\nBut the reasons for shortages of expensive infused drugs are particularly complicated, involving complex manufacturing processes, scientific uncertainty and financial motivations.\n\nIn the case of IVIG, the expensive treatment may be a victim of its own widening use.\n\nDating to the 1950s, immune globulin is often the only therapy for certain genetic, life-threatening conditions that disable the body\u2019s infection-fighting function. Its intravenous form is FDA-licensed for six conditions, including primary immunodeficiencies; Kawasaki disease, which causes inflammation in the blood vessels; preventive care after bone marrow transplants; and a neurological condition called chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n\nToday it is also prescribed for secondary immunodeficiency, which can occur when the body\u2019s immune system is compromised by viruses or treatments for cancer, although there may be other medicines for reinvigorating the immune system in those cases.\n\nPrescribing a medicine for a purpose not approved by the FDA \u2014 known as off-label use \u2014 is legal and common. It sometimes leads to new and effective uses of a drug.\n\nSome evidence shows that expanding the use of immune globulin to patients with a wider variety of illnesses, including types of cancers or recurrent infections, is helpful.\n\nBut it is also being tried for conditions \u201cwhere it is ineffectual and may actually increase the risks to patients,\u201d the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology warned in a March 2017 journal article that weighs the clinical rationale for various uses of the therapy.\n\nIn part as a result of this expanding off-label use, the industry\u2019s trade group shows a 66 percent increase in distribution of the treatment from 2012 to 2018 across North America and Europe.\n\nAnd Avorn said a portion of these uses may be encouraged by financial motivations. Cincinnati Children\u2019s, for example, charges $6,800 to $10,000 for every 10-gram dose, according to the hospital\u2019s list prices, which are generally higher than insurers pay. Adults often get more than 10 grams per infusion.\n\n\u201cAnd anytime an extremely costly infusion medicine is used in any setting, it\u2019s worth looking at who benefits economically from its use, especially for conditions in which data on effectiveness is limited or absent,\u201d Avorn said.\n\nNonetheless, increasing demand helped create the shortages, say pharmacists and others who study shortfalls. Immune globulin takes up to a year to produce, which includes plasma collection from healthy donors, processing, packaging and shipping \u2014 often at overseas manufacturing centers.\n\nThere are several manufacturers, with combined global sales of about $22.6 billion.\n\nAside from trying to boost plasma collection to deal with a shortfall, \u201cthe other piece is stewardship [of the supply] and that really is up to the hospitals, by and large,\u201d said John Boyle, chief executive of the Immune Deficiency Foundation, a group that advocates on behalf of people with genetic defects of the immune system. \u201cHospitals use an enormous portion of the plasma products out there.\u201d\n\nMany are scrambling to come up with ways to stretch their supplies.\n\nSome, like Cincinnati Children\u2019s, give top priority to patients with no other alternatives, often those with primary immune deficiencies, and those for whom not getting the treatment would be life-threatening.\n\nOthers, whose indications \u201cwere not as clear-cut or it was not necessarily dangerous to them to forgo it, were placed on the bottom of the list,\u201d said Derek Wheeler, chief of staff at Cincinnati Children\u2019s.\n\nShortages are not affecting every hospital or clinic. That variation occurs because facilities have contracts with specific distributors or manufacturers, each of which can have a different supply line.\n\nCristina Porch-Curren, an immunologist in Camarillo, Calif., said her patients have not run into problems getting the treatment, although one had to change brands.\n\nShe is concerned about the increasing use of immune globulin for \u201coff-label\u201d conditions.\n\n\u201cOff-label doesn\u2019t always mean bad. If you have someone who is really sick, with some terrible infection, on occasion that may be okay,\u201d she said.\n\nBut with limited supplies, she worries about growing interest by researchers and some physicians in using immune globulin for more widespread or ongoing conditions, such as dementia.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s concerning, especially for patients with primary immune deficiencies\u201d who have no other alternatives, she said.\n\nBack in Cincinnati, a temporary solution has been found for Easton.\n\nFFS Enterprises offered to supply his family with a different type of immune globulin after Easton\u2019s father contacted the company, which is one of the largest distributors of the therapy.\n\nInstead of an intravenous dose, it will give Easton a subcutaneous form, which can be injected as a shot at home. His doctor approved the switch, Daniels said, and the drug distributor said it would pick up the cost if his insurer, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, balks.\n\n\u2014 Kaiser Health News\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service and an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.\n\nRead more\n\nHow much should your medicine cost?\n\nWhy some patients don\u2019t take their medicine\n\nThe perils of value-based pricing for prescription drugs", "description": "Hospitals struggle to get enough IVIG, an infusing therapy often used as a \u201clast-chance \u2026 Haily Mary kind of approach for myriad condition.\u201d", "authors": ["Julie Appleby", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qnrnIAo-Zoo749ZtEcJ1SCSdzjQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VOW2B4W25AI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
