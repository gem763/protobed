The court also issued a European arrest warrant for former regional president Carles Puigdemont.\n\nCrowds of people poured into the streets of Barcelona within mere minutes of the ruling. Soon, Democratic Tsunami, a local group in favor of a more active form of civil disobedience, called on tens of thousands of its members to march on the city airport, located 15 kilometers away from the center of Barcelona.\n\nThe airport then saw fierce fighting between the crowds of angry protesters who had heeded the call, and the riot police deployed to the scene. Videos from the airport showed officers in full riot gear brutally dispersing the crowds by beating people with batons and pushing them to the ground.\n\nSpanish police brutally beaten Catalans in El Prat Airport Barcelona\u2019s airport under popular control now.

Dozens of flights have been canceled, leading to air traffic collapse and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. Some of the passengers also barely escaped the clashes between police and the angry crowds.\n\n\u00bfEres independentista?\n\n\u00bfApoyas la independencia de Catalu\u00f1a?\n\n\u00bften\u00edas que coger hoy en el Prat un vuelo muy importante para ti??\n\n\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 T E J O D E S !!!#SentenciaDelProces#Sentenciapic.twitter.com/pn7fSKBYLP \u2014 FREDY (@Fredy_ajs) October 14, 2019\n\nQue buena noche nos espera en el #Pratpic.twitter.com/RrH2ll8mUR \u2014 David C\u00e1ceres (@DavidCaceres_DC) October 14, 2019\n\nCroatian football star Ivan Rakitic, who currently plays for FC Barcelona, was among those caught up in the ordeal; he was seen walking along the highway near the embattled airport.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Ivan Rakitic (@ivanrakitic) uno de los afectados por las movilizaciones en el aeropuerto de Barcelona tras la #SentenciaProces\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 @PREC96pic.twitter.com/nLrV0fPGja \u2014 El Partidazo de COPE (@partidazocope) October 14, 2019\n\nThe clashes at the airport follow mass protests in the Catalan capital itself, which saw some Barcelona streets blocked by demonstrators. Protest rallies have also been reported in several big Catalan municipalities, such as Girona and Lleida.\n\nTensions between the Catalans and the Spanish central government have hardly subsided over the two years since the ill-fated independence vote, which Madrid declared illegal and invalid, as about a half of the seven-million-strong provincial population still support independence.\n\nAlso on rt.com Tyranny of the minority: The \u0421atalonia litmus test proves European elites ignore referendums\n\nThe court ruling that sentenced nine out of 12 separatist leaders to lengthy prison terms is likely to reignite those simmering tensions that have already been manifested in large-scale demonstrations and clashes between the protesters and police in the wake of the contentious vote.\n\nThe public anger over the sentences is shared by the province\u2019s leadership. Catalonia\u2019s President Quim Torra condemned it as \u201can act of vengeance, not an act of justice.\u201d Puigdemont, the former regional president and the face of the separatist movement, who remains in exile in Belgium, denounced the 100 years of total prison time for his former associates as an \u201catrocity.\u201d\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "Barcelona\u2019s El Prat airport has seen some brutal fighting as police in riot gear faced off with huge crowds of Catalans, angered by the lengthy prison sentences handed to the organizers of the 2017 independence referendum.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da4b91f20302713774866f7.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
