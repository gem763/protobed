Turmeric supplements are no exception. People claim the supplements can prevent heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, as well as help combat bodily inflammation and fight health conditions like diabetes and arthritis. That\u2019s a lot for one little supplement, but there is validity to some of these claims.\n\n\u201cThe active part of turmeric is curcumin, and there is actually a decent amount of research on this,\u201d Jamie Alan, PhD, an assistant professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWe have studies that show curcumin has anticancer effects in cell and animal models. It has also been shown to be protective against atherosclerosis and can prevent heart attacks in animal models.\u201d Curcumin has also been shown to decrease blood glucose (aka blood sugar) in rats, and to help combat bodily inflammation, Alan says.\n\nWhile experts don\u2019t totally understand how curcumin works to fight inflammation, Alan says that scientists do know that it increases specific immune cells and affects inflammatory regulators in your body.\n\nIn general, turmeric supplements can be beneficial for a lot of people, but patients with leukemia or lymphoma should avoid them, Alan says. Turmeric also interacts with anti-coagulents like warfarin, clopidogrel, and aspirin, so you don\u2019t want to take the supplements if you\u2019re on any of these medications. And, if you\u2019re pregnant or nursing, it\u2019s also best to take a pass, Alan says.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your doctor before taking any kind of new supplement, just in case. Once you get the go-ahead, these turmeric supplements are definitely worth trying, according to reviewers.\n\nThese all-natural supplements are packed with turmeric\u20141,500 milligrams, to be exact\u2014and they have nearly 11,000 reviews on Amazon. \u201cI was taking a lot of pain medicine for my arthritis. Now since I take the turmeric, almost all my pain is gone,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cPain GONE! Completely. That in and of itself is amazing,\u201d another said, noting that their sleep quality has also \u201cimproved dramatically\u201d since using the supplements.", "description": "Turmeric supplements are growing in popularity, and experts say there's a good reason for it.
