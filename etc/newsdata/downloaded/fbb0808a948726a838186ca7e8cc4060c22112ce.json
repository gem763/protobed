Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority, either. So the game that he\u2019s played, the politics that he\u2019s pursued have given us absolutely nothing and have produced a situation where we lose nearly 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks came after the Times Union in New York reported that Schumer, on a call with reporters, appeared to brush off O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons.\n\n\"I don't know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O'Rourke, but it's no excuse not to go forward,\" Schumer said, according to the report.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s supporters have touted recent polling showing public support for a buyback, especially among Democrats. The subject remains politically fraught, however, and some Democrats have accused O\u2019Rourke of playing into Republican fears about gun seizures.\n\nBut O'Rourke, speaking at a town hall near the theater where a gunman killed 12 people in 2012, suggested he is open to expanding his proposal even more to include additional classes of guns.\n\nAfter a Second Amendment advocate carrying a Glock pistol on her hip challenged him on the mandatory buyback, Evan Todd, a survivor of the Columbine High School massacre, asked O\u2019Rourke why he didn\u2019t expand his buyback proposal to include all semiautomatic weapons.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time we get rid of all semi-auto firearms?\u201d Todd asked.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said he was open to listening, inviting Todd to talk with him \u201cabout the kinds of weapons that are going to be important to be regulated.\u201d\n\nHe told reporters that he had shared his cellphone number with Todd and that \u201cif there\u2019s a way to improve what we have proposed, I want to make sure that we\u2019re reflecting that.\u201d\n\nOf Schumer and mandatory buybacks, O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cWhat he may not know, but what I hear loud and clear\u2014 because I\u2019m traveling the country listening to my fellow Americans \u2014 is that the people are there.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWe still don\u2019t have background checks.
