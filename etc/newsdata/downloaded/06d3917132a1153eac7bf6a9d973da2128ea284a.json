The company just announced the new $249 Surface Earbuds, which are the second product in its portfolio of headphones after last year\u2019s Surface Headphones. The Earbuds are similar to the many other wireless earbuds that are available already, but Microsoft has included some productivity-specific features with them that you won\u2019t find anywhere else. They\u2019ll be available later this year.\n\nI had a chance to demo the new Earbuds after Microsoft\u2019s presentation today, and while the environment wasn\u2019t great for evaluating the sound quality of the headphones, I did get to demo a few of their unique features.\n\nThe Earbuds are very similar feature-wise to other wireless earbuds. They have eight hours of battery life with a charging case that provides up to 24 hours of use, and they rest inside your ear without blocking your ear canal. That means they don\u2019t block outside sound all that well, and Microsoft says that\u2019s by design. They are more comfortable than most earbuds, however, and they managed to stay in my ears once I got the right size tips on them.\n\nOutside things are a little different, as the Earbuds have a large, dish-looking apparatus on them that\u2019s used for touch interactions. You can tap on the flat pad to play or pause music, launch apps like Spotify, or adjust the volume and skip tracks. You can also summon Cortana via a long press on the pad, but there isn\u2019t an always-listening feature like there is for Alexa or Siri on Amazon and Apple\u2019s earbuds.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the Earbuds is their ability to live transcribe what you are saying while presenting a PowerPoint on a connected computer. I was able to see the words I just spoke light up on the screen just below the slide, even though the noise levels in the testing room (as you\u2019ll hear in the video) are far from ideal.\n\nMicrosoft is going to have to rely on those productivity features to really justify the Earbuds\u2019 cost, however: at $250, they are considerably more expensive than the competition. And since they don\u2019t have things like active noise cancellation, they are missing features that are found on Amazon\u2019s far less expensive Alexa Buds.\n\nWe\u2019ll have plenty more to say about the Surface Earbuds once we are able to test them for review and truly evaluate their audio performance. Needless to say, between Amazon and Microsoft rapidly entering this space, it\u2019s no longer just an AirPods world.", "description": "Microsoft has announced its first truly wireless headphones, the $249 Surface Earbuds.
