While the wealthy will only be able to afford space travel at first, the eventual goal is to make the experience open to everyone, Alatorre said.\n\nThe Gateway Foundation isn't the only company aiming to widen the opportunity for space travel. In June, NASA announced that it hopes to open up the International Space Station to private astronauts by 2020.", "description": "A company is catering to people's fascination with space by planning to build an enormous hotel for tourist who want to experience life beyond Earth's atmosphere.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/space-2-ht-er-190915_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
