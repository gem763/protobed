The government wasn\u2019t riding in with the solutions to save the day and revitalize our once-thriving inner cities. Frankly, it was government that had wrought much of the destruction.\n\nEventually, I started looking to history for the answers. I wanted to know how the newly freed slaves in Post-Reconstruction America survived \u2013 even thrived. How did our ancestors build businesses, create outstanding educational institutions, and develop a significant \u201cmiddle class\u201d with a government that not only didn\u2019t provide programs for the black community, but was often antagonistic?\n\nI learned that they had created a vibrant civil society that consisted of strong families, a powerful faith life, distinguished educational institutions, and tightly woven communities where people looked out for one another.\n\nThese same institutions are the very building blocks we must begin rebuilding today to turn our inner cities around.\n\nFirst, we need to strengthen families by ensuring that no government program or policy is weakening them. I\u2019ve seen children who grew up without both parents at home begin to have trouble in school and get in trouble with the law. I\u2019ve seen fatherless teens look to drugs and street gangs to fill the void. I\u2019ve seen dependence take the place of work. I\u2019ve seen children grow up and continue this cycle to the next generation.\n\nSecond, we must stop the attacks on religious liberty, stop pushing churches out of desperately needed human services work, and stop marginalizing the positive role faith plays in our communities. Faith gives people hope and teaches them love. It teaches them that there are things bigger than themselves and there are consequences for the good and bad that we do. Churches also provide a sense of community, a place to learn strong values, and a safety net for those in physical, spiritual, and emotional need.\n\nThird, we must ensure a pathway out of poverty for inner-city children by fixing our broken educational system. Failing urban schools deprive our children of discovering the potential of their own minds, of proper socialization, and of future career prospects.\n\nFourth, we must reestablish a sense of community in our broken cities. Recently, we saw a small but poignant example of this in Baltimore \u2013 of people coming together to try to fix things on their own when they knew the cavalry wasn\u2019t coming any time soon.\n\nConservative activist Scott Presler was fed up with the despair he saw in Baltimore. So he used social media to organize a cleanup day, tweeting, \u201cI\u2019m going to go to Baltimore, even if it\u2019s just me standing on a street corner alone picking up trash.\u201d\n\nOf course, a trash cleanup day doesn\u2019t solve all of the inner city\u2019s problems, but it plants seeds of change. Within six days of Mr. Presler calling on people to join him, he had organized over 170 volunteers nationwide and from within Baltimore itself. Together, they picked up 12 tons of trash in 12 hours.\n\n12 tons.\n\nThe success of the cleanup attracted even more people who wanted to help, so there\u2019s another cleanup scheduled for September. Other cleanups have begun in Newark, NJ; Los Angeles; and elsewhere.\n\nEfforts like Mr. Presler\u2019s are what places like Baltimore need. They show the power of individuals in civil society coming together rather than waiting for government to step in. Just as important, the results of these cleanups aren\u2019t just cosmetic. They can have a lasting effect on improving neighborhood safety and pride.\n\nIt\u2019s based on the \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory: signs of inner-city decay like vandalism, trash, and smaller crimes going unpunished imply that government will tolerate a certain level of civil disorder. That disorder then attracts more of the same and even more serious crimes as the envelope keeps getting pushed. Taking care of the \u201cbroken windows\u201d can bring much-needed order, and residents regain respect for their own communities.\n\nFor years, our inner cities have been laboratories where the far left has experimented with big-government policies that have ended in failure, harming the very people they said they wanted to help. To turn situations like Baltimore around, we not only need better policies from government, we must reinforce and respect once again the very building blocks of society \u2013 family, faith, education, and community. These are the places where change must begin for any change to be truly successful.", "description": "The recent uproar over the crime and despair in Baltimore .09/02/2019 3:14:44AM EST.", "authors": ["Kay Coles", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/219/8a1b90b9-c370-45ba-9f63-18800a4e780a.png"}
