This hackathon-style challenge, for which Sun Life Hong Kong is the title sponsor, will see local students teaming up with STEM counterparts from overseas to develop the best solution for a specific issue related to protecting the oceans.\n\nThe teams will discuss their plans over the course of the two days before pitching their ideas to a panel of judges.\n\nHow an interest in STEM and the fight for gender equality led this female engineer to the Royal Air Force\n\n\u201cThe International STEMathon 2019 will be an excellent practice ground for students to apply their STEM knowledge to solving real-life issues,\u201d says Belinda Au, Sun Life Hong Kong\u2018s general manager for distribution and marketing. \u201cWe believe this will be the first step for many talented students keen to use STEM knowledge to build a greener future, a goal which is also in line with Sun Life\u2019s commitment to building sustainable, healthy communities. As a company, we are proud to be a title sponsor and doing our bit to help protect the oceans.\u201d\n\nThe competition, she notes, will also give students an important chance to reflect on their environmental footprint and how society\u2019s practices can be improved.\n\nAlex Ho, general manager for recruitment, circulation and syndication business at the South China Morning Post, echoes those views.\n\nIndustry leaders get real about future career opportunities for young people in technology, robots vs humans, and women in Stem\n\n\u201cYoung Post\u2019s vision is to provide what students need to equip themselves for an ever-changing world,\u201d he says. \u201cBy taking part in this hackathon event, they can gain valuable experience by discovering how a popular model for generating groundbreaking ideas works in practice.\u201d\n\nHe adds that local students will also benefit from the opportunity to show their creativity and work alongside their overseas counterparts.\n\nBasic materials will be provided for students to building their prototypes.

This could take the form of a device, computer software, a mobile app, or something else. Alternatively, students will be able to put forward a comprehensive proposal detailing how their invention tackle a specific problem.\n\nIn particular, the judges will be looking for creativity and innovation, good use of STEM skills and knowledge, details of any environmental impact, feasibility and practicality, and effective teamwork. Each member of the top three teams will receive a certificate of achievement, while all other students will receive a certificate of participation.\n\nTo enter, students in Form Three to Form Six should get together a team of ten and ask their school to nominate them. In addition, schools should submit a brief description outlining each team\u2019s achievements to date in STEM-related subjects. Each school can enter a maximum of two teams. Where appropriate, the International STEMathon 2019 can be considered as part of students\u2019 Other Learning Experiences.\n\nEdited by John Cremer", "description": "This hackathon-style challenge offers a rare chance for local STEM students to work with their overseas counterpart", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/img2710.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
