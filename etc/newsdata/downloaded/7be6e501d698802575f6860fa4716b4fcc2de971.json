Jones, who was the seventh overall pick in the 2000 NFL draft, resurrected his career in Chicago with back-to-back seasons over 1,200 rushing yards in 2005 and 2006.\n\nSo, when he speaks about how to improve the offense through the running game, coach Matt Nagy and the rest of Chicago's offensive staff should at least give it a listen.\n\nTechnically, Jones tweeted his plan to repair the Bears' struggling offense. But, the point remains.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"Nagy should learn the history of the Bears,\" Jones tweeted. \"When they've won in the past it's because they ran the ball 1st! The fans & the makeup of the Bears is blue-collar. Hard-nosed, physical fundamental football. Limit turnovers, chew up the clock & let the defense get you the ball back.\n\n\"And where is their fullback? How can you run the ball in Chicago without a fullback in the game? When u have a fullback in the game the linebackers know they have to strap up their helmets. It's going to be a physical game & some of them don't want that. Can't make it easy for them.\"\n\nTo be fair, fullback is a nearly extinct position in the NFL. But Jones' suggestion runs deeper than that; the Bears need to at least appear like they want to run the ball in order to make the defense respect the threat of a running game.\n\n\"They NEVER try to establish the run which puts all of the pressure on a young QB who is still learning & trying to figure out who he's going to be in this league,\" Jones said. \"The O line won't get into any rhythm if they don't run block enough & the defense can only hold up for so long.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Jones, Mitch Trubisky isn't ready to be the centerpiece of Chicago's offense just yet.\n\n\"Mitch is too young to have all of that pressure on him at once. He's talented but he's not ready yet. You have talented backs & an incredible defense. The O Line just needs to gain confidence run blocking in real-time. They have to establish a running game or things won't change.\"\n\nJones drew on some experience from the 2005 season when the Bears kept things pretty basic for then-rookie quarterback Kyle Orton, who enjoyed some moderate success that year. He also chimed in on the Trubisky vs. Patrick Mahomes and DeShaun Watson debate.\n\n\"Everyone matures at different times in the NFL. He's not those other guys so comparing him to them isn't going to help them win games right now. Establish a run game & take pressure off of him. Simplify the offense by giving him basic pass plays like we did with Orton in 05.\"\n\nSo how do the Bears get their offense back on a winning track? You guessed it: run the ball!\n\n\"It's not a old times sake thing. It's football. Every winning team establishes some sort of running game. Even if it's running back by committee or a running QB. The more tired a defense is from having to chase & tackle the more mental mistakes they're going to make.\n\n\"Which gives you a higher chance to win the game. When you run the ball you can take more chances throwing the ball downfield, running specialty plays such as screens and reverses. The defense can't just lay their ears back because they know they can get gashed at any time.\"\n\nHead over to Jones' Twitter page to follow along with his complete Bears breakdown. It's pretty epic and is a great reminder of just how passionate he is about this team, this city, and winning.\n\nThomas Jones tweets plan to fix Bears' struggling offense originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago", "description": "Former Chicago Bears RB Thomas Jones went on a Twitter rant offering advice to Matt Nagy on how to fix the offense's struggles.", "authors": ["Bryan Perez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/etH2szX_NecL2XQx_MPzLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05NDUuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qBMXBPNN0z73uWDbpfNheQ--~B/aD0yMjE2O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/5c4e252755589642c828b5bc16e341e1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
