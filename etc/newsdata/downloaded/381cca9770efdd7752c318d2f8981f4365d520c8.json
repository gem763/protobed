What else, right?\n\nThanks mostly to former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke for staging this party.\n\nO\u2019Rourke has regularly sprinkled the f-word into his campaign chats, so frequently, in fact, his backers created a T-shirt printed with one of his key talking points \u2014 \u201cTHIS IS [F-WORD] UP.\u201d He also just told Jemele Hill in a recent podcast how much he enjoyed using the word \u201cf-stick\u201d to describe various frustrations in life. Can you say presidential?\n\nNot to be outdone, Sen. Cory Booker called out prayers for victims of mass shootings as \u201cbullsh\u2014\u201d back in May. Andrew Yang spoke of how Russians were laughing their you-know-whats off at America. Sen. Bernie Sanders didn\u2019t write that bill \u2014 he \u201cwrote the damn bill\u201d on \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d And South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg echoed Booker and went with the \u201cbullsh\u2014\u201d drop during an interview with \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d in New York.\n\nAll this has led to ABC sending out the warnings, telling candidates \u201cwe will not be broadcasting on any delay, so there will be no opportunity to edit out foul language.\u201d\n\nWhat an age for politics; what a day to be an American voter.\n\nSince Democrats have no policy of substance to discuss, political watchers might as well have some fun with the three scheduled televised hours of what\u2019s sure to be a race to dredge out and promise the biggest giveaway, most expensive freebie, largest taxpayer pocket drain.\n\nA whiskey shot for Beto\u2019s first curse \u2014 two, if it\u2019s an f-bomb.\n\nA gulp of beer for every time Sanders insists Medicare for All can pay for itself.\n\nA shot of vodka each time Joe Biden forgets where he is.\n\nA sip of bourbon whenever Sen. Elizabeth Warren tells a lie.\n\nWith rules like that, it\u2019d be a miracle anyone stays sober past the first hour. Then again, take away the drinking games, and it\u2019d be a miracle anyone who\u2019s sober stays awake past the first few minutes.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
