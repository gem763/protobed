The Nov. 8 blaze destroyed nearly 15,000 homes in the Northern California city of 27,000 residents. The long recovery is just starting. (Feb. 15) AP\n\nPacific Gas & Electric says it may shut off power to more than 600,000 homes and businesses in parts of 30 counties for several days to reduce the risk of wildfires.\n\nThe power shutdowns across parts of northern, central and coastal California would begin early Wednesday and last through Thursday midday, the utility said.\n\n\u201cThis is shaping up to be one of the most severe dry wind events we\u2019ve seen in our territory in recent years,\" the utility said in a statement. \"We want our customers to be prepared for an extended outage that may last several days.\"\n\nAccuWeather noted that while some Santa Ana wind events usher in hot and arid air, this weeks winds should bring in somewhat cooler air that could ease the threat of a major wildfire outbreak.\n\n\"However, the combination of dry air, dry brush and gusty winds will significantly raise the chance of wildfire ignition,\" said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.\n\nPG&E's meteorological and operations teams were monitoring the \"evolving situation\" and were working with state and local agencies to prepare the public, said company senior vice president Michael Lewis.\n\n\"We want our customers to be aware that, based on this number, it could take several days to fully restore power after the weather passes and safety inspections are completed,\" Lewis said.\n\nClass-action lawsuit: Was California wildfire was caused by Pacific Gas & Electric?\n\nHe warned that customers may be affected by a power shutoff even if they are not experiencing extreme weather conditions in their specific location due to the way power lines work in unison across cities, counties and regions.\n\nThe company ordered a much smaller power cutoff in June involving thousands of customers in the Northern California counties of Napa, Solano and Yolo.\n\nThe utility has drawn blame for igniting several wildfires caused by downed power lines that killed dozens and destroyed thousands of homes. In June, PG&E agreed to pay $1 billion in damages to local governments. More than half of the settlement was related to a 2018 fire in Northern California that killed 85 people and destroyed more than 13,000 homes and devastate the town of Paradise.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/08/pacific-gas-electric-power-shutdown-affect-northern-california-prevent-wildfire/3907118002/", "description": "Pacific Gas & Electric says it may cut  power to more than 600,000 homes and businesses in parts of 30 counties for several days due to wildfire risk.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Published A.M.
