The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, +1.31% rose 2.4 basis points to 2.066%.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nReports said China was open to a limited trade resolution with the U.S., according to Bloomberg News on Wednesday, citing people with direct knowledge of tariff talks. A separate report from the Financial Times (paywall) indicated that China had offered to increase annual purchases of soy beans to 30 million tons, from the current 20 million tons.\n\nBolstered hopes for even a partial deal to the U.S.-China tariff spat boosted investor sentiment.
