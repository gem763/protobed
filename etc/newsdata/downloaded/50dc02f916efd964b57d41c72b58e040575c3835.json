(pic: DC Comics)\n\nWarner Bros. still hasn\u2019t announced a new Batman game but at least we might now know the name and a hint of what it\u2019ll be about.\n\nThe lack of any new Batman game since 2015\u2019s Arkham Knight remains one of the most baffling mysteries in gaming this generation, given how quick most publishers are to put out a sequel to a successful game.\n\nNeither Rocksteady, who are believed to be working on some sort of games a service title, or WB Games Montr\u00e9al, who made 2013\u2019s Arkham Origins, have released a new game all generation and there\u2019s still no official word from either about what they\u2019re working on.\n\nUnfofficially though it seems as if WB Games Montr\u00e9al\u2019s new game is called Batman: Arkham Legacy and will feature the entire \u2018Bat family\u2019 of playable characters.\n\nCapture the Knight / Cape sur la nuit pic.twitter.com/yMFXMd4djU \u2014 WB Games Montr\u00e9al (@WBGamesMTL) September 23, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWB Games Montr\u00e9al has been rumoured to be involved with several cancelled projects, all or most of which were intended to be Batman titles.\n\nLast year, one of their developers claimed the studio is working on two new DC Comics games, one of which has long been rumoured to be a Batman game involving the Court of Owls storyline \u2013 which is what seemed to be being teased last month.\n\nDespite assumptions that those teases would end in an official reveal nothing ever happened, but online leaker Sabi, who proved very reliable around E3, suggests that the new game has the very non-descriptive name of Batman: Arkham Legacy.\n\nInterestingly, comic book movie insider Thomas Polito then replied to the tweet, seeming to imply that the information was true.\n\nThe stuff about the playable family seems to be legit \u2014 Sabi (@New_WabiSabi) October 21, 2019\n\nThe mention of a \u2018playable family\u2019 is a reference to the Bat family concept from the comics, which includes all of Batman\u2019s many and varied sidekicks and allies.\n\nTraditionally, that includes multiple Robins (there have been several \u2013 many of which went on to create new alter egos, most notably Nightwing and Red Hood), several Batgirls and/or Oracle, and Batwoman.\n\nThere are many other more obscure characters the game could chose to include as well, such as more loosely associated (sometime) allies such as Catwoman, Huntress, Azrael, and Creeper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether that in turn implies multiplayer is unknown, although if that\u2019s the focus of Rocksteady\u2019s game it may be that Arkham Legacy is intended as a more traditional Arkham experience.\n\nOr maybe the rumours simply aren\u2019t true. Either way we still no nothing official and have no idea when an announcement might be made.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: The 8 best Batman games ever made \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature\n\nMORE: New Batman game teased with \u2018Capture the Knight\u2019 but no State of Play reveal\n\nMORE: Batman: Court of Owls teased by Arkham Origins developer", "description": "Warner Bros. still hasn\u2019t announced a new Batman game but at least we might now know the name and a hint of what it\u2019ll be about.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/s1uokammat7hpkzp8e3r-0d5e_1571736039.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
