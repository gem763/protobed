GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares, bond yields perch at six-week highs\n\n* MSCI world share index at highest since end of July\n\n* Europe's bourses creep higher, set for 4th week of gains\n\n* Trump wants full deal with Beijing after goodwill gestures\n\n* Bond yields at 6-week high as recession worries ebb\n\nBy Marc Jones\n\nLONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - World shares climbed to a\n\nsix-week high alongside benchmark government bond yields on\n\nFriday, as markets cheered signs of progress in U.S.-China trade\n\ntalks and another powerful slug of stimulus from the European\n\nCentral Bank.\n\nIt was a bit of a groggy start in Europe after it emerged\n\nnot all of the ECB's member country's had wanted to restart its\n\nmoney printing programme but the main bourses\n\neventually added 0.2% to what was already set to be a fourth\n\nstraight week of gains. .EU\n\nThe euro shuffled up to a two-week high in foreign exchange\n\nmarkets too, as traders there suspected the ECB may have now\n\nexhausted all ammunition of any worth, though a six-week low for\n\nthe safe-haven Japanese yen and the pound back above $1.24 for\n\nthe first time since late July also caught the attention. /FRX\n\n\"We have quite an interesting reaction to the ECB meeting\n\nwith the sense of the pushback from the core countries, and that\n\nessentially that the ECB has now thrown its last cards in,\" said\n\nJohn Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo bank.\n\n\"It looks like we are also getting to some pretty\n\ninteresting levels for yields. If the consolidation continues,\n\nat some point you have to question whether the easing (from the\n\ncentral banks) is actually there.\"\n\nU.S., Japanese and European long-dated bond yields were all\n\nat six-week highs. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries were offering almost\n\n1.8% compared with just over 1.4% at the start of September,\n\nwhile Germany's Bunds settled at the new ECB deposit rate of\n\n-0.5% .\n\nIt was all built on revived risk appetite and after U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had said on Thursday he was potentially\n\nopen to an interim trade deal with China, although he stressed\n\nan \"easy\" agreement would not be possible. It would certainly help optimism in the near future though,\n\na new Reuters poll showed most economists believed the trade\n\ndispute would worsen or at best stay the same over the coming\n\nyear. In line with the main world stock indexes, Asian shares\n\nended their week at a six-week high. Japan's Nikkei did\n\neven better and scored a 4-month peak, while Wall Street's S&P\n\n500 had closed just short of its all-time closing high. .T\n\nAs well as the boost from the Trump trade signals and the\n\nECB's salvo of easing measures, sentiment had also been helped\n\nby a U.S. tax overhaul plan aimed at middle-income households\n\nnext year.\n\n\"Risk assets should find further support from accommodative\n\npolicies, which are set to remain in vogue for some time, and\n\nnot just in Europe as seen in the global easing trend,\" said\n\nEsty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis in Geneva,\n\nSwitzerland.\n\nEASY! EASY!\n\nU.S. Fed funds rate futures FEDWATCH now imply a 0.25\n\npercentage point interest rate cut by the U.S. central bank next\n\nweek but have effectively priced out any chance of a larger cut.\n\nThe Fed will announce its policy on Wednesday, followed by\n\nthe Bank of Japan (BOJ) on Thursday.\n\nSources told Reuters the BOJ is leaning towards standing pat\n\nnext week if markets are calm, but is brainstorming ways to\n\ndeepen negative interest rates at minimal cost. \"I think a rally in stock prices will run out of steam soon.\n\nIt's typical buy-on-rumour-sell-on-fact trade on central bank\n\nstimulus and will be over by the Fed and the BOJ's meetings,\"\n\nsaid Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset\n\nManagement.\n\nDespite the rise in other economy-sensitive assets, oil\n\nprices were on course to post weekly losses.\n\nAs well as continued worries about weakening demand, traders\n\nhave begun speculating that the U.S. may ease sanctions on Iran\n\nafter Trump ousted his hawkish national security adviser John\n\nBolton this week.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 0.25% to $60.21 a barrel\n\nwhile U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down\n\n0.2% at $54.98. Gold ticked up to $1,503 an ounce.
