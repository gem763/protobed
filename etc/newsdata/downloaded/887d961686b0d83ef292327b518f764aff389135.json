It accused Australian politicians of pandering to the United States.\n\n\"It is an old trick of certain radical Australian politicians to make such groundless attacks against China,\" the newspaper said in an editorial published on Tuesday.\n\n\"To some extent, people like Dutton have damaged China-Australia relations. For Australian right-wing politicians, Washington is even more important than Canberra. If the US shows discontent at China, they may immediately follow suit.\"\n\n\"This explains Dutton\u2019s unreasonable comments on China \u2013 he places personal political interests above Australia\u2019s national interests. He attacks China to earn political favours, but he hurts Australia.\"\n\nIn the strongest criticism of China's regime by an Australian minister, Mr Dutton said on Friday that China's conduct was at odds with Australian values and warnings about their behaviour should be heeded. He raised concerns about cyber security attacks, intellectual property theft and attacks on academic freedom.", "description": "China's Global Times newspaper says the Home Affairs Minister's 'groundless' concerns are influenced by Washington.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.324%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_217%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0eeca37b6d5bb59321c8d41bd872ba7c44e683bd", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
