At the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, on Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared to show a glimmer of regret about escalating trade tensions with China. However, hours later, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham doubled down on the president\u2019s commitment, saying Mr. Trump \u201cregrets not raising the tariffs higher.\u201d\n\nWhile there are risks to his strategy, some political analysts and pollsters contend his get-tough-on-China platform can help anchor the president\u2019s campaign, just as it did in 2016.\n\n\u201c2020 is going to be framed by this issue,\u201d said Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond a trade war. It\u2019s engaging them in this economic conflict, which is trade, technology and currency. He\u2019s got to be out there every day pounding it.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, however, could be vulnerable if pressing the trade war against China yields no obvious results. Employment growth in manufacturing has slowed over the past year. Measures of industrial production are also slumping, indicating a manufacturing economy under pressure.\n\nWhat is more, the impact of tariffs on consumers is just beginning to be felt. JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimates the average U.S. household will have to pay $1,000 a year in added costs once all scheduled levies are implemented.\n\nThe government typically uses three tools to help ward off a recession. But with these already in play to help prop up the economy, the Trump administration may have reason to worry. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains. Photo: AP\n\nMo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and a former top Democratic National Committee official, believes Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive posture with China could backfire as consumers start paying higher prices.\n\n\u201cWhile it may help the president with some people who like the bravado of it, the economic bottom line for a lot of people is very shaky,\u201d Ms. Elleithee said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some supporters of the president saying this pain is your patriotic duty, but I\u2019m not sure that is something a lot of people are going to buy into a few months down the road.\u201d\n\nDemocrats overall have been divided on trade, with top-echelon candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren holding similar views as Mr. Trump. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, has repeatedly urged him to carry on the fight with China.\n\nAt rallies and in his comments to reporters, Mr. Trump has portrayed himself as taking on a job others didn\u2019t have the stomach to pursue.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t my trade war,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday, angrily dismissing a question about the risk of a recession. \u201cThis is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other presidents.\u201d\n\nLooking into the sky, spreading his hands, he added: \u201cI am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it. So I\u2019m taking on China.\u201d Mr. Trump later said he was joking about being the chosen one.\n\nWithin the administration, advisers who early on warned against a conflict have mostly left, giving more sway to hawks who have urged him to press forward.\n\nAnd while Americans in general support free trade, people believe China has unfair trade practices with the U.S. by a 62% to 30% margin, according to a Gallup poll last year.\n\n\u201cChina is a unique case,\u201d said Mohamed Younis, Gallup\u2019s editor in chief. \u201cIt\u2019s the only country where a majority of Americans agree that they have an unfair trade relationship with the United States.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Has the trade war changed your mind about President Trump? How? Join the conversation below.\n\nMr. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in large part by narrowly flipping industrial states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and GOP strategists say his message resonated with factory workers and others who believed China\u2019s rise came at the expense of manufacturing jobs in the U.S.\n\nBut the economy\u2019s job gains under Mr. Trump have been concentrated in professional services and health care, industries far removed from the trade war.\n\nThe brunt of the conflict has been felt by farmers, who tend to be in deeply Republican regions and so far back the president\u2019s initiative. Their economic pain has been mitigated by billions of dollars in government aid to make up for the loss of sales to China.\n\nThe patience voters may afford Mr. Trump now could change if the overall economy begins to sour, and if voters blame the trade war for a downturn.\n\nIn recent days, as worries of a global recession have risen, the president has blasted the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell, just as White House officials have fanned out to TV news shows to argue the economy is strong and not threatened by the trade war.\n\n\u201cThey know that\u2019s where they are exposed and are starting a campaign against it,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former chief economist for the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. \u201cThey are pushing very hard to stop that narrative.\u201d\n\nChris Krueger, a managing director at Cowen Washington Research Group, said Democrats would rather talk about topics such as climate change and income inequality than trade. Because they generally agree with Mr. Trump\u2019s posture toward China, he said, they are left with arguing the more nuanced point that he is going about it the wrong way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a muddled message right now,\u201d Mr. Krueger said.\n\nDespite their public bravado, members of Mr. Trump\u2019s team are preparing for a slowing economy by framing the trade war as a fight for American jobs and workers. One senior Trump adviser played down the impact of market turmoil on rank-and file voters, characterizing that as an issue that largely concerns the affluent.\n\n\u201cDemocrats want to fight for the stock market and fat cats on Wall Street? Go right ahead,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nEven amid slowing manufacturing, the Trump campaign thinks the president could expand the electoral map to several other states with traditional manufacturing bases like Minnesota, New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nMr. Bannon is among those contending the conflict will run through the campaign season.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s not folding and this is not going to be resolved by Election Day in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the single most defining issue in the first half of the 21st century and it will set the tone and the direction of not just the country but the global economy. That\u2019s why this is a fight worth having.\u201d\n\n\u2014Ken Thomas contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com and Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump\u2019s trade battle with China is shaping up as a definitive issue in the 2020 campaign, with shaken financial markets and fears of an economic slowdown testing the Republican\u2019s insistence that his blunt-force trade posture will be an asset.", "authors": ["Josh Zumbrun", "Alex Leary", "Josh.Zumbrun Wsj.Com", "Alex.Leary Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-101077/social"}
