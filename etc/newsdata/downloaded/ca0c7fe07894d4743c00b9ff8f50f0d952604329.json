That is 5% of global oil output and about half of Saudi's production, but Saudi Arabia has sufficient supplies to maintain its current export level for about a month.\n\nOil prices initially spiked nearly 20% in trading Sunday evening but were up just about 14.5% in U.S. trading Monday, the biggest one-day move since February 2016. Brent was trading at $68.45 per barrel in late trading.\n\n\"What the market is pricing is geopolitical risk premium and tail risk. Something like this has never happened before. There have been attempts, but those were foiled,\" said Amarpreet Singh, Barclays energy analyst. \"Something like this to Saudi supply has absolutely never happened, even during the Gulf War.\"\n\nHouthi rebels, aligned with Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Iran was responsible.\n\nSaudi Arabia's foreign ministry said an investigation into the incident shows Iranian weapons were used in the attack. President Donald Trump presided over a national security meeting at the White House Monday morning on the topic of Iran, NBC News reported from sources.\n\nTrump told reporters Monday afternoon that he was in no rush to respond to the attacks on Saudi oil facilities. He also said \"it was a very big attack\" that could be met with a much larger attack.\n\nTrump said Pompeo is going to Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. has been in touch with European countries including France, which is still a party to the nuclear agreement with Iran.\n\n\"The more we have coming from Washington and Riyadh implicating the Iranians in this attack, there may be more pressure for Washington to back words with action,\" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities research. \"This is one of the most strategically important energy facilities in the world. If you do nothing, are you essentially greenlighting more attacks? At what point do you need to show some deterrence?\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said, at a press briefing Monday, that the attack was self-defense by Houthis and a retaliatory response for Saudi attacks on Yemen.\n\nThe attack on Aramco facilities was highly sophisticated and targeted the critical processing plants that help reduce hydrogen sulfur in crude. There have been numerous other attacks on Saudi Arabia, as well as on oil tankers, but none has done such extensive damage.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs said a lengthier outage could result in a sharp jump in crude prices. For instance, if the current level of production remained down for more than six weeks, there could be a quick rally in Brent to $75 per barrel, they said in a note. Brent is the international benchmark and traditionally has been more sensitive to events in the Middle East.", "description": "The price of oil could go sharply higher, depending on the duration of the disruption at Saudi oil facilities and whether there is a military response.", "authors": ["Patti Domm", "Nasos Koukakis", "Special To Cnbc.Com"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106074062-1565612575513preview.jpg?v=1568631857", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
