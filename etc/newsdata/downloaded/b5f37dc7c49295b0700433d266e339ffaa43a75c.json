I was promoting Carrie the Musical at a haunted house.\n\n\"At the end of the night, I was too tired to shower and remove my makeup so when I wrecked the first responders saw my blood and freaked.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\n\"Waiting for my parents to come pick me up from the scene, two more policemen showed up. By this time, I was out of the vehicle and making conversation with the people.\n\n\"The new officer says 'I hate to interrupt but don\u2019t you guys think she needs medical assistance'.\"\n\nIn the brilliant post, which has had more than 68,000 retweets and 370,000 likes, she added that she had risked her life to promote Carrie the Muscial and hoped she had made its author Stephen King proud.\n\nOthers told the student they were glad she was safe but found the coincidence hilarious.\n\nOne said: \"I have no idea who you are and glad you are safe but the whole Carrie/dead thing has me laughing so hard hahaha.\"\n\nAnother told of their own similar experience, writing: \"Sis that happened to me two years ago on Halloween . I had my throat fake slit and people thought I was dead because I fainted for a second.\"", "description": "Sidney Wolfe was dressed as horror character Carrie and caked in fake blood when she crashed her car", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758459.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_301019SLUG_7333JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
