It says the type of work she did is common to the sort of patisserie practised in other 'fine dining restaurants'.\n\nMs Anderson (pictured at work) says she was pushed too hard whilst helping to make the eccentric and fancy creations at the Berkshire restaurant\n\nDocuments lodged with London's High Court by Ms Anderson's lawyers state that her troubles stemmed from her time spent working at the Fat Duck, where she began as a commis chef in June 2014.\n\nShe did an initial six-month spell from June to December 2014 where she carried out food preparation tasks involving manual dexterity, and under pressure of time, she says.\n\nHer role included packing individually wrapped sweets into cellophane bags from 7-11am, before she switched to creating chocolate playing cards from 11.30am to around 4pm.\n\nMs Anderson had to place each sweet into its own cellophane bag using tweezers and believes she 'wrapped and packed' around 400 separate sweets each day.\n\nThe chocolate playing cards were made in moulds of metal and plastic, while each mould could create 12 cards and weighed over a kilo.\n\nChef Heston Blumenthal is pictured at the entrance to the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire\n\nOne of the many creations at the Fat Duck, The Queen of Hearts, a jam tart\n\nMs Anderson would hold the mould in her left hand with her palm upturned - and her wrist extended - while ladling chocolate in with her other hand.\n\nThe completed mould weighed around two kilos, it is claimed, and Ms Anderson aimed to produce around 180 cards per day.\n\nOn top of that, she had to 'demould and trim' the cards with a paring knife to 'perfect them and scrape off excess chocolate'.\n\n'The process had to be carried out under time pressure as it had to be completed before the chocolate set in each mould,' her barrister, Charles Robertshaw, says in court papers.\n\nHer kitchen shift then switched to making whisky wine gums between 4-6pm, she says, and she would produce around 550 by hand.\n\nA bag of sweets given to diners at the Far Duck. Mr Anderson's tasks included putting 400 sweets a day into small bags using tweezers\n\nThe Fat Duck opened in Bray in 1994 and achieved three Michelin stars in a record three years, carving out a name for eccentric genius by serving up dishes such as Mr Blumenthal's 'nitro scrambled egg and bacon ice cream'.\n\nThe chef and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s have become famous for their culinary experimentation, and the restaurant has a nearby laboratory, where the team concoct their pioneering creations.\n\nMiss Anderson followed the restaurant when it moved to Melbourne, Australia, in January 2015, while the Bray premises were renovated.\n\nFrom February 2015, her work followed a similar pattern to life in Bray, she claims, although she was under pressure to handle even more moulds, due to wastage caused by cards melting faster in the warmer climate.\n\nThe Fat Duck opened in Bray in 1994 and achieved three Michelin stars in a record three years\n\nIn June 2015, she began complaining of pain in her forearm, Mr Robertshaw says.\n\n'By 23 June 2015, the pain had become significant and on this date she visited a physiotherapist who advised her that the pain was being caused by her long hours and repetitive work,' he continued.\n\nShe temporarily stopped work due to the pain, but three months later resumed work at the revamped Bray restaurant, before hanging up her apron for good in November 2015.\n\nWhat is Repetitive strain injury? Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is a general term used to describe the pain felt in muscles, nerves and tendons caused by repetitive movement and overuse. It's also known as work-related upper limb disorder, or non-specific upper limb pain. The condition mostly affects parts of the upper body, such as the forearms and elbows, wrists and hands, neck and shoulders. The symptoms of RSI can range from mild to severe and usually develop gradually. They include pain, aching or tenderness, stiffness, throbbing, tingling or numbness At first, you might only notice symptoms when you're carrying out a particular repetitive action. But without treatment, the symptoms of RSI may eventually become constant and cause longer periods of pain. You may also get swelling in the affected area, which can last for several months. RSI is related to the overuse of muscles and tendons in the upper body. Certain things are thought to increase the risk of RSI, including repetitive activities, doing a high-intensity activity for a long time without rest, poor posture or activities that involve working in an awkward position.\n\nHer role during her final phase at the Fat Duck again involved tasks such as 'hand-piping whisky wine gums' and wrapping petit fours sweets.\n\nBut she also spent a week preparing mushroom logs, requiring her to 'pinch creases into 500 sugar sheets per week with her fingers', she claims.\n\nMedics later pinpointed a torn ligament in Ms Anderson's left wrist, although most of her forearm pain has now resolved.\n\nShe now suffers 'significant wrist pain' even after carrying out normal manual tasks, court documents state.\n\nThe injury means she has recurring problems with daily tasks such as heavy lifting, driving and - crucially - cooking.\n\nLawyers for Ms Anderson, of say the restaurant failed to allow sufficient rest periods or support, and 'required her to work under time pressure throughout the day'.\n\nBut the Fat Duck is denying all the claims and points out that Ms Anderson was transferred to lighter duties after she complained about making chocolate patisserie.\n\nThe work she carried out had no known risk of triggering an 'upper limb disorder', defence lawyers insist, and the techniques she practised are standard in the world of haute cuisine.\n\nHer workload was not oppressive and Ms Anderson was given all the support and assistance she needed, they maintain. They also say she filed her claim too late after learning she had a potential claim against the restaurant.\n\nMs Anderson's case reached the High Court recently as lawyers on both sides discussed how it should progress towards trial.\n\nJudge John Leslie was told that more medical tests are needed to pin down exactly what Ms Anderson is suffering from and to properly quantify her claim.\n\n'In view of her condition, it's quite difficult for her to find employment,' her solicitor David Poole told the court, adding: 'she can't work as a chef at the moment'.\n\nThe case will return to court next year.", "description": "Pastry chef Sharon Anderson,28, of Letterkenny, Co Donegal, Ireland, is plagued by RSI caused by carrying out tasks at the restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, her lawyers claim.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/13/20130562-0-image-a-16_1571921065409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
