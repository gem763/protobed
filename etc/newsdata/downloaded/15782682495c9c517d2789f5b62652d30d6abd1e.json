Improbably, she had turned a largely powerless congressional panel monitoring the bank bailout into a national bully pulpit of populist fury. Her target was not just the big banks but the new Democratic administration which she suggested had been co-opted by them.\n\nShe parlayed her newfound status into a push for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to be part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill. As the legislation was about to pass in June of 2010, Warren met with the president\u2019s adviser David Axelrod and was blunt: she wanted Obama to nominate her to run the agency or she could continue probing the Treasury department\u2019s every move.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/7c/e7/c9c961624e0ab6f6ba5072c97b34/warrenobama-thumbnail-copy.jpg\" true\n\n\u201cI took it as a message, I think she meant it as one,\u201d Axelrod says. Warren sent the signal that she could either be inside the tent pissing out or outside pissing in, Axelrod says, quoting a vivid Lyndon Johnson quip.\n\nObama was equally straightforward. \u201cTell her to keep her mouth shut,\u201d he said, according to Axelrod. \u201cShe may well be the choice, but we can\u2019t surface that now.\u201d\n\nEven though she had infuriated many on his own economic team, Obama did want Warren inside the tent. After he signed the Dodd-Frank legislation in July of 2010 with her in the front row, Obama tried to find a compromise.\n\nOne White House official suggested to Warren that the president would nominate someone else but she would be the bureau\u2019s \u201ccheerleader.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was insulting. And I wasn't going to do it,\u201d Warren recalls in an interview this summer from the presidential campaign trail in Iowa, dodging whether she found the suggestion sexist.\n\nWhat about a special adviser? No. The bureau\u2019s public spokesperson? Nope.\n\nObama then tried to make the personal sell. On a sweltering day in September of 2010, they met in the Oval Office and Obama took her to a private garden to pitch a vague role setting up the agency under Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. With Obama cool in his shirtsleeves and Warren sweating in a jacket because she felt her shirt underneath was too revealing for a presidential audience, she again said no.\n\n\u201cI was not going to set that agency up asking Tim Geithner every day \u2018Mother may I?\u2019\u201d Warren says now. \u201cIt just wasn't going to work.\u201d\n\n'That's not a success'\n\nAs Warren campaigns to become the 46th president, she doesn\u2019t mention the 44th very much.\n\nWhen she does, it\u2019s usually to praise him. Asked in April at a CNN town hall what their main philosophical difference was, Warren did not name any. \u201cYou know, I'm going to take this in just a little bit different direction, if I can,\u201d she said and then gushed about Obama\u2019s steadfast support for the CFPB. \u201cI will always be grateful to the president for that,\u201d she said.\n\nBut interviews with more than 50 top officials in the Obama White House and Treasury Department, members of Warren\u2019s inner circle at the time, and Warren herself, reveal a far more combative relationship between her and the administration than she usually discusses on the campaign trail. Tensions between Warren and Obama were palpable to White House aides, even as she reserved her real fury for Geithner and White House National Economic Council chief Larry Summers, whom she regarded as predisposed towards big banks over families struggling to save their homes.\n\nFor Warren herself, the years of the financial crisis are now the touchstone of her political career, validating the conviction at the heart of her presidential candidacy: that the system is rigged.\n\nThe acrimonious differences between Warren and her allies, and members of the Obama team, led in part to her decision, with prodding from Obama himself, to leave the administration to run for the Senate rather than continue pursuing the leadership of the consumer-protection bureau. But they never fully abated, and now represent dueling approaches to Democratic economic policy-making, presenting the possibility that the next Democratic president will have ascended to the height of Democratic Party politics in part by bashing the previous one.\n\nTop: Members of the activist group ACORN protest in front of the New York Stock Exchange over the foreclosure crisis in June of 2009.

And what he meant was the survival of the banks,\u201d Warren says, recalling a meeting in the Treasury building in the fall of 2009. \u201cHe says \u2018We\u2019ve foamed the runway -- enough that the big banks can land.\u2019 And the fact that millions of families were losing their homes, that millions of people lost their jobs, you know, savings, just wasn't part of that calculation.\u201d\n\nSome White House officials also brought concerns about foreclosures to Geithner, and his perspective was that saving the financial system was the necessary first step. Stabilizing the housing market was like bringing down unemployment in that \u201cit will trail,\u201d Geithner explained, according to Axelrod\u2019s memoir, Believer.\n\n\u201cYeah, exactly,\u201d Warren says now, scoffing. \u201cThat's how they thought of it.\u201d\n\nSummers bristles at the attack on him and Geithner.\n\n\u201cEveryone had the same objective of preventing a Depression,\u201d Summers told POLITICO in a statement. \u201cWithout saving the financial system we did not think that was possible. The one time when the no bailouts strategy was tried \u2014 with respect to Lehman [Brothers] \u2014 it was a catastrophe.\u201d\n\nDespite attempts to gloss over past disputes by focusing on areas of mutual agreement like the CFPB, simmering bitterness remains between Warren and large swathes of the Obama administration. In interviews, many former White House and Treasury officials say they consider Warren a self-serving grandstander who cast them as villains while they were trying to save the global economy from catastrophe -- a job they think they did pretty well, all things considered.\n\nGeithner, who declined to comment for this story, wrote in his memoir Stress Test that he felt Warren \u201cwas better at impugning our choices -- as well as our integrity and our competence -- than identifying feasible alternatives.\u201d He added that \u201c[h]er criticisms of the financial rescue, if well intentioned, were mostly unjustified.\u201d\n\nOther Obama administration officials call her a \u201cprofessional critic,\u201d \u201csanctimonious,\u201d and a \u201ccondescending narcissist.\u201d As one former Treasury aide put it: \u201cWe\u2019re with Barack. We\u2019re the liberals. Why are you pissing in our face?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cShe loved herself and some of her staff had a God view of her and that\u2019s not aligned with government and bureaucrats which require teamwork.\u201d\n\n\u2014Obama Administration Official\n\n\n\nOne of the administration officials adds: \u201cShe loved herself and some of her staff had a God view of her and that\u2019s not aligned with government and bureaucrats which require teamwork.\u201d\n\nPeople who worked closely with Warren at that time but who are not on her presidential campaign are equally scathing about Obama and his team.\n\n\u201cTim and Larry and those guys, they are the villains of the Woody Guthrie song,\u201d says one, a reference to the lyric \u201cSome will rob you with a six-gun, And some with a fountain pen\u201d in \u2018Pretty Boy Floyd.\u2019\n\n\u201cObama called the bankers \u2018fat cat's once and spent seven years feeling bad about it,\u201d ridicules another.\n\n\u201cThe Treasury crew especially thought they were the smartest guys in the room and the attitude was \u2018We\u2019re saving the world, what the fuck do you want with us?\u2019 \u201d says one more.\n\nIt was amid these fights with the economic team that Obama wrestled with what to do with Warren\u2019s request that she head the CFPB (Obama, through his spokesperson, declined to comment on his relationship with Warren). Senate Republicans and even some Democrats were adamantly opposed and Obama\u2019s political team said getting the 60 votes necessary for her confirmation would be almost impossible. Plus, some in the administration worried about having such a political lightning rod in charge of a new agency trying to establish itself.\n\nLiberals, who were already frustrated with Obama, were clamoring for him to nominate her. At the same time, some members of his administration despised Warren and wanted nothing to do with her.\n\nObama was conflicted. The 2010 midterms were coming fast, the economy was still struggling, the most ambitious climate change bill ever to pass the House had stalled in the Senate, and myriad other issues loomed. But top administration officials remember Obama spending an inordinate amount of time going back and forth about what to do with Warren.\n\nThen-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, with an eye on the elections, became frustrated with the time-suck and recalls telling top officials that \u201cthe idea of financial reform, banking reform is a lot bigger than one office and one person,\u201d emphasizing it had nothing to do with Warren herself.\n\nTop: As Massachusetts' Senate nominee, Warren speaks at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September 2012.

That\u2019s because she had been a Warren ally in the White House during the CFPB deliberations and retained a sense of respect for her, even while acknowledging that she \u201cbroke a lot of eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go so well, initially,\u201d Jarrett says with a laugh, recalling her efforts to persuade Warren to give up personal control of the consumer-protection bureau. \u201cIt\u2019s your baby and she wanted to see it grow up so I understood completely why she would have reservations about changing course.\u201d\n\nAt Obama\u2019s direction, Axelrod, who lived in the same apartment complex as Warren, met with her and her husband privately and encouraged her to make the Senate run. Sens. Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer lobbied her as well and promised to help her assemble one of the most experienced campaign teams money could buy. With a national profile that could help her raise money, Warren was an ideal recruit for the Democrats\u2019 top Senate target in 2012.\n\nAs Obama and Warren both mulled what to do in early 2011, Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts -- who worked closely with Warren during the passage of the financial reform legislation -- got the president\u2019s ear at a photo op and encouraged him to nominate Warren for the CFPB anyway.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well it\u2019s a win-win. Either you appoint her and she gets confirmed. Or she is rejected and she wins the Senate seat,\u201d Frank recalls. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Do you think she wants to be a senator?\u2019 and I said \u2018I think she wants your job but she\u2019s go to start somewhere.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd he said, \u2018Do you think she wants to be a senator?\u2019 and I said \u2018I think she wants your job but she\u2019s go to start somewhere.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.)\n\n\n\nFrank ended up being right. As Obama increasingly shied away from nominating her to lead the CFPB and others lobbied her on the Senate run, she warmed to the idea, recognizing the potential power of the senatorial pulpit.\n\nIn July 2011, nearly a year after he signed the Dodd-Frank bill and after Warren had spent 10 months standing up the agency in a way that even impressed some critics in the Treasury Department, Obama took the middle ground. With Warren by his side, Obama nominated former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray to lead the CFPB. That same day, progressives called on her to make the Senate run. Less than a month later, Warren began a \u201clistening tour\u201d back home in Massachusetts to explore it. The field thinned and no other big-name candidate stepped forward to challenge her. She promised she wouldn\u2019t go back to D.C. just to be the \u201c100th-in-seniority, be-polite-and-make-no-difference senator from Massachusetts.\u201d\n\nBefore going back to Massachusetts for the Senate run, Warren met privately with Obama one last time. \u201cIt was hot! He liked to be outside for these meetings,\u201d she remembers, bemused.\n\nThey discussed a bit of everything but Warren says she urged him to surround himself with more people who she felt understood the level of anger in the country. \u201cThat\u2019s how I saw it. That this crisis is not over,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThat the survival of the big banks is not the measure of recovery.\u201d\n\n\"You guys are on the same team?\"\n\nWarren said yes before she understood the job.\n\nIt was November 2008. Obama had won the presidency days before. Reid, the Senate majority leader, called to offer Warren \u2013 comfortably ensconced in her teaching position at Harvard Law School -- a part-time job on a 5-person oversight panel charged with monitoring the $700 billion bank bailout known as TARP.\n\nOn paper, the panel was mostly useless. The legislative text tasked it with writing a report every 30 days and allowed it to hold hearings but didn\u2019t give it the power to subpoena witnesses.\n\nAfter saying \u201cyes\u201d to Reid, \u201cI remember reading the, what is it like four lines, and I thought, \u2018Whoa, that's it?\u2019\u201d Warren says.\n\nWith little statutory power, Warren plotted out another strategy: Be loud.\n\nShe had experience with that approach. During the decade-long battle over bankruptcy code reform that ended in 2005, Warren says, she learned how to create political leverage for herself and her cause through the media.\n\n\u201cI was so naive at the beginning, I thought \u2018All I have to do is explain it,\u2019\u201d she recalls of her initial work with Congress on bankruptcy first on the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in the \u201990\u2019s and then as a Harvard professor in the early 2000s. \u201cI started to understand in that process, how the only way to get Congress on the side of families that were broke was to bring public pressure on them. So in that space of time, during the \u2018Bankruptcy Wars,\u2019 I must have spent a million hours on the telephone with reporters starting with \u2018B is for bankruptcy.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel (bottom), which was tasked with making regular assessments of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, Warren (top) asks Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner a question at a public hearing in 2009. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo, Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nShe testified before Congress, wrote op-eds blasting legislators including then-Senator Biden, and became an early entrant in the progressive blogosphere with \u201cWarren Reports,\u201d a group blog hosted by an offshoot of Talking Points Memo. She called lawyers looking for clients who showcased problems with the financial system whom she could then provide to reporters. \u201cIf you've got no stories to tell, there are a lot of reporters who won\u2019t talk about it,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd if the reporters won\u2019t talk about it, then the world isn't going to hear about it.\u201d\n\nSo when she returned to D.C. in 2008 and became chair of the oversight panel, the mandated monthly report became a monthly media tour. It would begin before dawn with an aide bringing her an Egg McMuffin but no coffee (\u201cCan you imagine me on coffee?!,\u201d she once explained to an aide who asked how she didn\u2019t drink it.) Warren talked to everyone. She bashed the banks and the Obama administration on Fox and Friends, in The New York Times, and in Michael Moore\u2019s 2009 documentary Capitalism: A Love Story.\n\nThe oversight panel and its few dozen staffers were relegated to the Government Printing Office where mini-forklifts, easy-to-assemble furniture that would occasionally collapse, and boxes of printer toner made up the workspace.\n\nBut the location came with access to Senate Recording Studio. Warren surprised members of her own staff by producing monthly videos of herself explaining each report. She and aides also created a comprehensive website with a regularly updated \u201cblog.\u201d Commonplace now, these digital tools weren't being used by many members of Congress in 2008.\n\nGoing so public was also a way to \u201cstart plowing the ground for the legislative changes that I knew were coming because every day that the stock market dropped I\u2019d think about: \u2018So, Congress is going to have to act. What are they going to do?\u2019 \u201d Warren explains.\n\nShe also criticized Obama directly, telling author Ron Suskind at the time that she didn\u2019t know why Obama was making certain moves because \u201cHe meets with bankers. He doesn\u2019t meet with me.\u201d\n\nHer national profile reached the point-of-no-return in April 2009 after an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. \u201cThat is the first time in six months to a year that I felt better,\u201d Stewart said after she summed up the financial crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you did just there but for a second that was like financial chicken soup for me.\u201d\n\nHer most sensational moments, however, were when grilling Geithner. The new Secretary of the Treasury had been president of the New York Federal Reserve in the lead-up to and during the worst of the financial crisis. Obama believed Geithner\u2019s selection would help ensure stability across administrations while the financial system was on the brink of disaster whereas Warren saw it as putting the people who helped create the crisis in charge of solving it.\n\nA former student once dubbed Warren\u2019s teaching method as \u201cSocratic with a machine gun,\u201d and in 2009 and 2010 Geithner was at the end of the barrel. Her questioning was so brutal at times that it stunned some of the Republicans working on the oversight panel.\n\nWarren shakes hands with Geithner on Capitol Hill prior to Geithner testifying before her oversight panel in December 2009. | Haraz N. Ghanbari/AP Photo\n\nBefore a 2010 hearing about the status of TARP, Warren and Geithner made friendly small-talk in the anteroom, remembers Ken Troske, a conservative economic professor at the University of Kentucky on the oversight panel\u2019s staff. \u201cThen we get into this hearing then she climbs down his throat in ways that are extraordinary,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI mean, you guys are on the same team?\u201d he remembers asking himself.\n\n\u201cYou set aside 50 billion dollars and what do you have to show for it?\"Warren demanded of Geithner at the hearing.\n\n\u201cThe point is they ultimately lost their homes. So what is the metric for success here?\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cTime is also running out to make certain that TARP money is used to help families and small businesses the way it was so quickly used to help Wall Street,\u201d she pressed him at the same hearing.\n\n\"It seems clear that Treasury's efforts to reduce mortgage foreclosures is not working,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm losing the logic here, Mr. Secretary,\" she said at another hearing.\n\n\u201cA.I.G. has received about $70 billion in TARP money, about $100 billion in loans from the Fed. Do you know where the money went?\u201d she asked at one, betraying a slight smirk as she did.\n\nSuch scenes made an impact.\n\n\u201cIt was a viral thing,\u201d Axelrod acknowledges.\n\nGeithner accused her of distorting the truth and defended his actions. \u201cThere is no job growth without economic growth, no economic growth without access to credit, no access to credit without a stable functioning financial system and our emergency programs played an essential role in starting that process of recovery and repair,\u201d Geithner said.\n\nMany in the White House felt Warren\u2019s critiques were righteous but dumb and following them would have hurt the very people she claimed to be championing. Geithner later wrote that \u201cher TARP oversight hearings often felt more like made-for-YouTube inquisitions than serious inquiries.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing about her conversations with Summers and with Geithner, they couldn\u2019t talk over her head.\u201d\n\n\u2014Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.)\n\n\n\nBut making them for YouTube and a wide swath of people was precisely the point.\n\n\u201cWhen Elizabeth was as blunt and direct as she was in standing up to Geithner in those hearing, people in the progressive world were electrified by it and heartened that someone was willing to stand up to a Democratic White House,\u201d explains Mike Lux, a longtime Democratic operative who was an ally of Warren\u2019s during the financial crisis.\n\nAs Obama positioned himself between the bankers and the pitchforks and took a hard turn from campaign poetry to governing prose, Warren\u2019s furious rhetoric filled a populist void that many on the left had hoped Obama would occupy. Her response to the financial crisis led New York Magazine to declare in 2011 that \u201cin large swathes of blue America, Warren\u2019s star actually eclipses Obama\u2019s.\u201d\n\nReid, who appointed Warren to the oversight panel and has been an admirer of her presidential run, says he thought Warren clashed so fiercely with Geithner and Summers in part because she understood financial markets well enough that they couldn\u2019t condescend to her.\n\n\u201cOne thing about her conversations with Summers and with Geithner, they couldn\u2019t talk over her head,\u201d says Reid, adding that Summers, a former Treasury secretary himself and president of Harvard University, wasn\u2019t used to that. \u201cI met with Summers many, many times and, frankly, he talked about a lot of things I didn\u2019t quite comprehend. But with her, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHonk if I\u2019m Paying Your Mortgage\u201d\n\nBut some of their ideological differences were also rooted in their divergent backgrounds.\n\nGeithner\u2019s upbringing was \u201cvery privileged\u201d as he writes in his book. Self-deprecatingly, he admits to being waitlisted at Wesleyan and Williams but accepted at Dartmouth in part because he was a legacy student. He then worked for Henry Kissinger in the private sector before ascending to the upper echelons of the Treasury Department under the tutelage of Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Summers, who himself was the son of two Ivy League professors. Geithner flew around the world responding to macro financial crises and then served as president of the New York Fed from 2003 to 2009. He was a registered independent when Obama nominated him to be Treasury Secretary.\n\nTaking cues from former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan who often used impenetrable jargon, Geithner deliberately spoke in \u201cunderstated, nuanced, deliberately dull language that wouldn\u2019t move markets or depress confidence,\u201d as he later wrote. Despite persistent charges to the contrary -- including from allies of Warren -- he never worked at a bank or financial firm before the crisis. Nonetheless, he was ensconced in and a product of the economic establishment. He had a healthy dose of noblesse oblige and an earnestness about public service.\n\nWarren came from a working-class family in Oklahoma that faced its own micro financial crisis when her father had a heart attack. She earned a debate scholarship to George Washington University, but dropped out to marry her high school boyfriend whom she later divorced. She ultimately graduated from the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and worked her way up to the highest rungs of legal academia -- from teaching at the University of Houston to Harvard and becoming one of the country\u2019s foremost experts on bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cMaybe this is what lots of people do who grow up with no money, but I\u2019ll tell you this: I taught everything about money,\u201d she declared at a recent rally in Seattle, explaining her zeal for teaching topics like bankruptcy and finance.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe one thing you need to know about Elizabeth Warren is that you don\u2019t get from Norman, Oklahoma, to where she is right now and take the journey she took without a steel spine and an indefatigability.\u201d\n\n\u2014David Axelrod\n\n\n\nShe served on the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in the late \u201990\u2019s, and then watched Congress largely ignore the commission\u2019s recommendations and pass a more pro-industry reform. Well before the crisis hit, she had often found herself fighting against the establishment Geithner represented. She spoke unapologetically and bluntly.\n\n\u201cThe one thing you need to know about Elizabeth Warren is that you don\u2019t get from Norman, Oklahoma, to where she is right now and take the journey she took without a steel spine and an indefatigability,\u201d Axelrod says admiringly.\n\nWhen the crash came, Warren saw a reckoning for a system she had long said was fraudulent and the chance to revamp it entirely. Geithner felt his first, second and third priority was to save that same system from collapse because then no other goals were possible.\n\n\u201cOld Testament vengeance appeals to the populist fury of the moment, but the truly moral thing to do during a raging financial inferno is to put it out,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe goal should be to protect the innocent, even if some of the arsonists escape their full measure of justice.\u201d\n\nOn April 15, 2009, the day annual income taxes are due to the federal government, activists for the nascent Tea Party protest at the Federal Building Plaza in Chicago. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn the fall of 2009, Geithner invited Warren and others overseeing TARP to the Treasury building for a briefing on the broader recovery efforts. At one point, Warren interrupted him to ask about the department\u2019s response to the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cAfter the rush-rush-rush to bail out the big banks with giant buckets of money, this plan seemed designed to deliver foreclosure relief with all the urgency of putting out a forest fire with an eyedropper,\u201d Warren wrote in her 2014 memoir, A Fighting Chance.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t fix the economy by fixing housing, but we could do the reverse,\u201d Geither explained in his book, a sentiment he shared in a subsequent oversight hearing.\n\nGeithner was also concerned about the politics of bailing out millions of people who were on the verge of being foreclosed on while the vast majority of people were managing to pay their mortgages on time.\n\nThe first Tea Party rallies had begun to spring up after a cable news rant by financial pundit Rick Santelli who focused on this point: \u201cHow many of you people want to pay for your neighbor\u2019s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can\u2019t pay their bills?\u201d he asked. \u201cHonk if I\u2019m Paying Your Mortgage,\u201d with the Obama logo as the \u2018o\u2019 in \u201cHonk\u201d became a popular right-wing bumper sticker.\n\n\u201c[T]here were real fairness issues, as well as political issues, around using tax dollars to help their neighbors who got in over their heads,\u201d Geithner wrote.\n\nThat perspective was particularly infuriating to Warren. She had spent much of her career trying to debunk what she called the \u201cmyth of the immoral debtor\u201d-- essentially the stereotype that people in debt were spendthrifts and deadbeats when her research in bankruptcy courts showed that the majority of people facing bankruptcy were working class people struggling to hang on.\n\nWhen Geithner explained his perspective on the issue at a fall 2009 meeting, Warren later wrote that she \u201cfelt as if one of us was standing on a snow-covered mountaintop and the other was crawling through Death Valley. Our views of the world -- and the problems we saw -- were that different.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Two Warrens\u201d\n\nThe 61-year-old Harvard professor and the 49-year-old Secretary of the Treasury were fighting over their seatbelts.\n\n\n\nIt was the fall of 2010. Obama had recently made his compromise appointment for Warren to stand up the CFPB which also meant Warren was moving into the Treasury building. The mood in the building was tense according to people in both camps, but Warren and Geithner each wanted to make it work.\n\nOn Warren\u2019s first day, Geithner gave her a cop\u2019s hat -- Warren had often referred to the CFPB as a \u201ccop on the beat\u201d-- and invited her out to lunch, as she recalled in A Fighting Chance.\n\n\u201cPut on your seat belt, Mr. Secretary,\u201d Warren told him on their way to the restaurant.\n\nExplaining that the car was bulletproof and the driver was well-trained with a gun, Geithner replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have to...We\u2019re safe here.\u201d\n\nAs the car sped along, Warren replied \u201cWhat? Are you kidding?\u201d She recalled that she may have raised her voice as she said: \u201cWhat good is that if we get hit and this thing turns over a few times and you smash your head against that great bulletproof window?\u201d\n\nHis seatbelt remained unfastened. (He fastened it on the way back from lunch, she noted.)\n\nIt was a bumpy start that got bumpier when someone anonymously told POLITICO that Warren\u2019s new office was getting a fresh paint job and furniture, a makeover at odds with her populist brand. Geithner personally apologized to Warren for the report. \u201cYou could feel the frustration in the building when she was hired,\u201d says one former Treasury official.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, accompanied by Warren, right, and Geithner, left, announces in September 2010 from the White House Rose Garden that Warren will head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped to create, in an advisory role. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo\n\nBut as she came in and began working, some administration officials felt like there were \u201ctwo Warrens.\u201d In public, she was all righteous fury. In private, they say, they often saw a more reasonable figure.\n\nSome administration insiders saw the \u201ctwo Warrens\u201d as proof of her hypocrisy. Her allies saw it as proof of her effectiveness. They note that her public rage had a strategic purpose and forced people to pay attention to her and her issues.\n\n\u201cThey thought she was just doing it for publicity instead of doing it to create leverage to get in the room,\u201d says one official who worked both at the CFPB and in the Obama administration. \u201cShe created an outside pressure base that allowed her priorities to be heard.\u201d\n\nEven those most critical of Warren say she brandished her pragmatism more than her populism while at Treasury, and say she was effective as a result. She readily brought in some top Treasury officials and her first hires for the consumer agency were a surprising mix of people from financial-services firms like Capital One and Morgan Stanley along with bureaucrats and academics. The Inspector General, whose job is to find problems, was rather complimentary of Warren\u2019s tenure. Some ex-officials also say they were impressed at the administration skills of an academic with almost no management experience.\n\n\u201cShe was very focused on talent and culture, talent and culture, talent and culture,\u201d says the same official. Another former CFPB employee fondly remembered that when she had a baby, Warren\u2019s gift was a baby-sized silver spoon -- a joking nod at her own soak-the-rich reputation.\n\nSome Obama administration officials felt that Warren\u2019s pragmatism in setting up the CFPB validated their own response to the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cShe was meeting with the stakeholders, she was choosing her battles wisely,\u201d says Axelrod. \u201cIt suggested to me that while there's no doubt that she is an ideologue in some ways and speaks in sort of these pugilistic tones that she also has an understanding that governing requires a different approach, a different set of skills.\u201d\n\nThere is still some uncertainty, however, about how a President Warren would govern. \u201cWe don't really have a large enough sample size, because she's only run one thing, and she ran it for 10 months,\u201d Axelrod says.\n\n\n\nObama v. Warren continued\n\nThe Warren-Obama brawls never really stopped.\n\nAfter Massachusetts voters elected her to the Senate in 2012, Warren was far more wary of media but used her new platform to stay loud. She eschewed the playbook followed by Hillary Clinton and other new senators with a national profile, which was to lie low.\n\nIn 2013, she helped sink Summers\u2019 nomination to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, a position he had long pined for and that, according to Axelrod, Obama had promised him at the outset of the administration. She followed that up with a 2014 memoir in which she wrote that Summers had warned her that she could either be an outsider or an insider but that the first rule of being an insider was not criticizing other insiders.\n\n\u201cI guess recollections differ,\u201d Summers says now, in response to her depiction of his advice. \u201cI\u2019ve never before been accused of being biased towards going along to get along and I don\u2019t think that was my advice. My recollection is that Elizabeth asked how her commission could have greater impact. I responded that if they sometimes praised something that was done they would have more impact than always excoriating policy makers.\u201d\n\nIn late 2014 and early 2015, she almost single-handedly killed Obama\u2019s nominee for the undersecretary of domestic finance, Antonio Weiss.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d she wrote in a scathing Huffington Post piece attacking Weiss\u2019s work in the private sector particularly on corporate inversions. Her opposition was rooted in her broader critique of the administration that began during her time as a TARP watchdog.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Obama administration to loosen the hold that Wall Street banks have over economic policy making. Sure, big banks are important, but running this economy for American families is a lot more important,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSome administration officials again saw what they considered opportunistic grandstanding. \u201cIt made Treasury less effective and it hurt President Obama,\u201d says one former White House official.\n\nAs a senator, Warren speaks to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler (top) and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Jo White (bottom) before a hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in July 2013.

Sherrod Brown, a TPP opponent, who said \u201cI think the president was disrespectful to her\u201d and that Obama \u201chas made this more personal than he needed to.\u201d\n\nEven in the final weeks of the presidential race in 2016, when most Democrats were closing ranks, Warren wrote to Obama urging him to unilaterally replace his chairwoman of the SEC, Mary Jo White, with another SEC commissioner. Warren had been feuding with White since 2015 when she wrote a 13-page letter to the SEC chair bluntly telling her that \u201cto date, your leadership of the Commission has been extremely disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration had repeatedly defended White but Warren wrote to Obama that \u201cChair White's extraordinary, ongoing efforts to undermine the agency's central mission make such a step necessary.\u201d\n\nOne former Treasury official says people in the department were glad Warren addressed the letter to Obama so he could finally understand what it was like to have to deal with her on a daily basis.\n\nThe president didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\n\nThe Warren Winnebago\n\nThree years later, Warren is casting herself as the standard-bearer of the party Obama once led.\n\nIn rural Western Iowa, she is sitting in a Winnebago with \u201cHONK IF YOU\u2019RE READY FOR BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGE\u201d printed on the back. When one person honks during a 30-minute drive, Warren yelps \u201cWe got \u2018em! They honked! Big structural change! Yes!\u201d\n\nWith a Starbucks venti iced tea in hand and a half-eaten banana on the table, Warren looks cool in a thin, light pink cardigan despite just finishing an hour walk in the hot sun surveying flood damage in Pacific Junction. The Winnebago is stocked with healthy snacks including Boom Chicka Pop, Avocados, Cheez-It Extra Toasty and BelVita crackers. There are some cookies with \"PERSIST\" written on them from a devoted fan with a bakery along with Michelob Ultras in the fridge.

Crickets from Warren and her aides.\n\nShe is talking about how she witnessed firsthand, in the Obama administration, how powerful institutions had more access to power than those most affected by the crisis.\n\n\u201cWho comes into the office of the Secretary of Treasury? Who comes in to the Federal Reserve Bank to plead their case? Who's on the phone with the top economic advisors?\u201d she asks rhetorically.\n\n\u201cIt's not the poor guy down the street who's been cheated on his mortgage and is six days away from the sheriff coming and moving him and his kids out on the sidewalk. And that's -- that's how the system is rigged...They have 1000 points of access to every decision maker in Washington. And regular families, they got none. They got nothing. And that, that, tilts every decision, every day, just a little bit.\u201d\n\nWarren insists that she doesn\u2019t question the motives of the people who served in Obama\u2019s Treasury Department. But asked if she thought they had been \u201csort of captured by the system--\u201d Warren jumps in: \u201cThat\u2019s it. They just they saw the world differently. They had spent all their time with giant banks and their representatives. This is my point about how Washington works.\u201d\n\nSuch broad-brush comments inflame former Obama advisers. Many regard her as insufficiently grateful to Obama and Biden and others in the administration.\n\nObama and Warren embrace each other during a campaign fundraiser in Boston during her 2012 run for Senate. | Stephan Savoia/AP Photo\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren would be a beloved Harvard Law Professor not a presidential candidate if @barackobama and @JoeBiden had not worked with her to make her idea to form a consumer financial protection bureau law,\u201d former White House communications director Jen Psaki tweeted in April.\n\nBeyond the question of her loyalty, some question the soundness of her ideas. Summers, for one, has co-written two op-eds arguing against the underlying math in Warren\u2019s wealth tax, the central means for how she says she will pay for her ambitious liberal agenda.\n\nWhile many on the Obama team take issue with agenda items such as imposing a wealth tax and furthering trade protectionism, they wonder if Warren, in the Oval Office, would more closely resemble the pragmatic figure who reached out beyond her inner circle to set up the CFPB.\n\n\"The global political world is filled with people who capitalize on anger and she has,\" summed up one former Obama official, who recalled her as a \u201cdemagogue\u201d on TARP.\n\nBegrudgingly, however, the official and several others say they have gained some new respect for her by watching her closely on the presidential campaign trail.\n\n\n\n\"I certainly like this Elizabeth Warren more than the Elizabeth Warren of that era.\"\n\n\u2014former obama official\n\n\n\n\u201cIronically, and I give her credit on this, part of the reason she\u2019s doing well politically today is that she has put forward plans that have details,\u201d the former official says. \u201cI certainly like this Elizabeth Warren more than the Elizabeth Warren of that era.\"\n\nBut the differences between the two camps may be difficult to bridge. Were she to get the Democratic nomination, the ex-Obama team may rally around Warren to defeat Donald Trump, but some worry about what she would do if confronted with an economic crash of her own.\n\n\"Financial crises are not morality plays,\u201d says Summers. \u201cSenator Warren was right and made a huge contribution by pushing for the CFPB but the idea that once crisis took hold you could resolve it from the bottom up was unrealistic and would have been catastrophic if attempted.\"\n\n", "description": "Interviews with Warren's inner circle reveal a combative relationship between her and the Obama administration.", "authors": ["Alex Thompson", "Shawna Chen"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bd/e6/44ddc6a64559bb3fd2d8deada341/thompson-warrenobama-lede.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
