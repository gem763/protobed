The business-friendly incumbent has sought to lead the country out of economic isolation by pushing reforms and forcefully promoted the free trade deal with the EU.\n\nThe warning from Brazil highlights the latest trouble for the deal, which was concluded in June and is supposed to crack open the highly defensive South American market for European exports.\n\nThe ratification of the agreement has already been thrown into doubt by European concerns about deforestation and rainforest fires, a lack of enforceability of environmental clauses as well as a veto by Austrian lawmakers. The accord needs to be approved by EU governments, the European Parliament, some 40 national parliaments across Europe as well as national assemblies in the Mercosur bloc.\n\nBut the Argentine election has the potential to derail the accord much sooner, before it even gets to the ratification phase, which is supposed to start in the second half of 2020.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro sounded the alarm this week that Kirchner's comeback could not only jeopardize the trade deal but the whole Mercosur bloc, which in addition to Argentina and Brazil includes Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\"We know that the return of ... Cristina Kirchner's class to the Argentine government can indeed endanger the entire Mercosur,\" he told reporters on Wednesday during a state visit to Japan, according to Brazilian media.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is that Argentina continues the trade policies of Macri in case the opposition wins,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cIf not, we may get together with Paraguay and Uruguay to make a decision,\" he added, alluding to a potential scenario under which Brazil and allies could seek to either exclude Argentina from Mercosur, or leave the bloc themselves.\n\n\"If you are possibly putting the entire Mercosur at risk, you have to have an alternative in your pocket,\" he said.\n\nThe warning from Brazil highlights the latest trouble for the deal, which was concluded in June and is supposed to crack open the highly defensive South American market for European exports, from cars to machinery, while lowering EU agricultural tariffs for Mercosur exports such as beef, sugar and ethanol.\n\nIn Argentina, Fern\u00e1ndez and Kirchner have criticized the trade deal as surrendering the country's industrial sector to powerful European competitors for the price of turning Argentina into a simple exporter of agricultural commodities. During a televised election debate last week, Fern\u00e1ndez alluded to his previous calls for renegotiating the trade deal: \"I'm not afraid of re-opening [the agreement],\" he said.\n\nThe divergences on trade policy further fuel concerns about the overall economic and financial crisis in Argentina. Many Argentinians who once supported Macri now feel disappointment with his promises of reforms because he didn't manage to stop the Argentine peso from crashing in recent years, and the country now looks likely to request another bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nOfficials, diplomats and lawmakers in Brussels are observing the situation with concern.\n\nSome observers predict that Fern\u00e1ndez and Kirchner will moderate their tone on the Mercosur deal if they get into office.\n\n\"It's clear that these are crucial elections,\" said Nicola Danti, the vice chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Mercosur. \"Argentina is a significant country in the Mercosur bloc ... [and] if it was to return to protectionist policies, this would put our agreement in a very fragile situation.\"\n\nDanti added that the EU-Mercosur accord was not just a trade deal but also \"very important from the political perspective, it defines our strategic partnership with the region.\"\n\nOne EU diplomat said there were \"some serious concerns\" about whether the Mercosur deal, which is currently under legal review, could even move into the ratification phase next year if Argentina changes its position on the deal. The diplomat noted that Fern\u00e1ndez and Bolsonaro had a \"pretty poisonous\" relationship, which could make it more difficult for Mercosur to agree on a common position.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez, in last week's debate, said he wanted \"to unite Latin America and improve Mercosur\" to \"defy the challenges of globalization.\"\n\nAnother EU diplomat noted that Bolsonaro has already discussed a bilateral trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump, and warned Brazil could turn toward Washington if political changes in Argentina were to throw a spanner into the works of the EU deal.\n\nMEP Sven Simon, the spokesperson for the center-right European People's Party on the Mercosur deal, said that because it took 20 years to negotiate the agreement in the first place, it would be \"difficult\" for the EU to re-open the pact, as Fern\u00e1ndez and Kirchner want.\n\n\"If we unroll the deal, we face the challenge that nothing is negotiated until everything is negotiated,\" he said. Brazil would come up with its own demands, and so could France, he added. \"It would unravel a carefully struck balance.\"\n\nSome observers predict that Fern\u00e1ndez and Kirchner will moderate their tone on the Mercosur deal if they get into office.\n\nShunko Rojas, a former Argentine undersecretary for trade, told POLITICO that a Kirchner government would face pressure from various sectors that stand to benefit from the trade deal \u2014 especially if Brazil decided to push ahead and enact the agreement without Argentina.\n\n\"If Brazil ratifies the deal and benefits from increased exports to Europe, for example in the beef sector, then Argentina cannot allow itself to lose out,\" he said. \"I\u2019m sure once Fern\u00e1ndez takes office and sees the fine print [of the agreement], he\u2019ll support it.\"\n\nMEP Danti said he also remained cautiously optimistic: \"I think, nowadays, even a Peronist government cannot return that easily to a protectionist policy.\"\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service Pro Trade.
