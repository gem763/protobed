But journalists asked Khan and Trump about it ahead of a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cSo I was going to say that, when you\u2019re supposed to meet Narendra Modi, now I would have asked you to at least lift the siege,\u201d he told Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge humanitarian crisis taking place.\u201d\n\nThe Houston rally, called \u201cHowdy, Modi,\u201d gave Modi the opportunity to demonstrate his rapport with Trump, whom he endorsed to tens of thousands of Indian-Americans who attended. But Modi also drew Trump into offering tacit support for the Indian leader\u2019s moves to expand his country\u2019s authority over the parts of Kashmir it controls. India and Pakistan, which both possess nuclear weapons, have fought two major wars over the territory and regularly skirmish across the Line of Control that divides it.\n\n\u201cBorder security is vital to the United States. Border security is vital to India, we understand that,\u201d Trump said at the Houston event. He pledged to fight \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and insisted: \u201cWe must protect our borders.\u201d\n\nIn a speech that followed Trump\u2019s remarks, Modi obliquely criticized Pakistan and accused it of harboring terrorists, then assured the crowd that Trump was committed to fighting terrorism.\n\nTrump indicated on Monday that he had been surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was going to hear that statement, I would say. I heard a very aggressive statement yesterday,\u201d though he didn\u2019t specify which of the Indian prime minister\u2019s remarks he was referring to.\n\nModi charged at the Houston event that \u201cpeople have put their hatred of India at the center of their political agenda,\u201d without naming Pakistan. \u201cThese are people who want unrest. These are people who support terrorism and nurture terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe rhetorically asked who was responsible for the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai and the 2001 attacks in the U.S. \u201cYou know them, very well,\u201d Modi said. \u201cYou know who they are. It\u2019s not just you, the whole world knows who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Mumbai attackers were Pakistanis, while several key figures in the Sept. 11 attacks, including Osama bin Laden, were killed or captured in Pakistan.\n\nModi in August scrapped seven decades of autonomy in the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, prompting Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic and trade ties with India. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said last week that India ultimately expects to rule over the entire state of Kashmir.\n\nKhan said in his meeting with Trump that \u201c8 million people are under siege by 900,000 troops\u201d in Kashmir and \u201cthat this is the beginning of a crisis.\n\n\u201cI honestly feel that this crisis is going to get much bigger, what is happening in Kashmir,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. has a responsibility to help defuse it, he said.\n\n\u201cJust the fact that the position of the United States -- it\u2019s the most powerful country, it can affect the United Nations Security Council, it has a voice, so we look to the U.S. to put out flames in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump said of Kashmir that \u201cI\u2019d like to see everything work out, I want it to be humane, I want everybody to be treated well.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Archana Chaudhary.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Josh Wingrove in Washington at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Justin Blum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump found himself drawn deeper into a decades-long dispute between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region on Monday, as Pakistan\u2019s prime minister expressed frustration about a rally his Indian counterpart staged with the U.S. president a day earlier.Pakistan Prime Minister", "authors": ["Josh Wingrove"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
