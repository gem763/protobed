Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday said that if elected to the White House, the child of her vice president would not be allowed to serve on the board of a foreign company.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Democratic presidential hopeful told reporters in New Hampshire, before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know - I\u2019d have to go back and look at the details.\u201d\n\nHer campaign later clarified to the Washington Post that ethics proposals Ms. Warren has introduced don\u2019t prevent children of a vice president from serving on a company\u2019s board.\n\nThe situation is relevant in light of the ongoing questions surrounding Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and his role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nWhile vice president, Mr. Biden had threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Ukrainian officials agreed to fire a prosecutor who had reportedly been eyeing the company.\n\nHouse Democrats this week announced they were formally opening an inquiry into whether President Trump committed impeachable offenses when he allegedly pressed Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens in a July phone call.\n\nMr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. A transcript of the call released by the White House on Wednesday did not show an explicit \u201cquid pro quo\u201d where Mr. Trump threatened to withhold military aid in exchange for help investigating his political opponent, though he did suggest that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky look into the Bidens.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
