It's the same iPhone you know and love, but slightly better than the previous one.\n\nThere's one huge difference between 2018's iPhone XS and 2019's iPhone 11: $300.\n\nThe iPhone 11 comes in six colors, just like the iPhone XR. Apple\n\nThat's right: The new iPhone 11 costs $700, which represents a major price cut from the $1,000 iPhone XS. We're talking about 300 big ones! That's a lot of cash!\n\nBut it's not the right comparison. The iPhone 11 is actually a replacement for last year's \"budget\" iPhone, the iPhone XR, which cost $750 when it launched alongside the $1,000 iPhone XS.\n\nRead more: These are Apple's new iPhones: the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max\n\nIn reality, the $700 iPhone 11 has a much smaller price cut than it appears: just $50.\n\nIt's a trick of marketing: The name \"iPhone 11\" makes it sound as if it's the new flagship, but it isn't.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro is the new flagship, and it costs the same $1,000 as last year's flagship iPhone XS.\n\nHere's the 2019 iPhone lineup, with the \"budget\" phone on the left, at $700, and the flagship Pro models in the center and on the right:\n\nDon't be tricked: The iPhone 11 is the \"budget\" iPhone option in 2019. Apple\n\nIf you look closely at the specs of the iPhone XR and the specs of the iPhone 11, you'll quickly realize that the iPhone 11 is the successor to last year's budget iPhone.\n\nFor starters, they have the same type of screen (\"Liquid Retina HD\"), and it's the same size (6.1 inches). The iPhone 11 camera has two sensors, compared with the iPhone 11 Pro's three; the iPhone XR featured a single camera sensor compared with the iPhone XS's dual-sensor setup.\n\nAnd then there are the build materials: The iPhone 11 is made of glass and aluminum, just as the iPhone XR was, while the iPhone 11 Pro is made of stainless steel, just as the iPhone XS was.\n\nNotably, there is no new version of the iPhone XR \u2014 and that's because the iPhone 11 is exactly that, albeit without the \"budget\" branding the iPhone XR carried. It's a brilliant move for Apple that repositions its budget phone as its flagship.\n\nBut make no mistake: If you buy the iPhone 11, you're getting the \"budget\" iPhone of 2019.\n\nNow tell us what you think!", "description": "It might sound as if the new iPhone 11 is a big discount compared with the iPhone XS \u2014 but the real comparison is the iPhone XR.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7820402e22af2400353249-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
