You subscribed to MobPair for \u00a32.99 per week from MobPair until you text STOP to 89365. HELP? 02032890416.\u2019\n\nHowever, when she checked her phone bill she realised she had been paying \u00a32.99 a week for a subscription. After Vodafone failed to refund her, she contacted This is Money for help.\n\nThe text that Mary received from MobPair, telling her she had subscribed to the service\n\nMary's case chimes with a series of complaints from Vodafone customers online forums, who say they too have been signed up to pay for services they didn't want.\n\nShe said: \u2018I have not knowingly subscribed to MobPair and did not text stop or ring the number as I thought it was a scam to charge me for the text or the phone call.\u2019\n\nWhen she contacted Vodafone about the issue, she was told that she must have inadvertently clicked on a link whilst using the internet.\n\nThe phone firm did say it would block the messages for her but it took a very long phone call before they agreed to refund her 50 per cent of the charges.\n\nMary did not accept this and said she would cancel her contract and would pay the \u00a3400 early termination fee.\n\nHowever, after This is Money contacted Vodafone, it agreed to refund her the full amount she was charged.\n\nAfter doing some research, Mary saw someone claim in an online forum that Vodafone receive 30 per cent of the fee for the subscription charges. However, this is something the company denies.\n\nIt said it does not directly contract with merchants such as Mobpair but instead there are a series of aggregator partners who are connected to all Mobile Network Operators.\n\nThe aggregator partners are responsible for ensuring merchants deliver a value for money service in strict compliance with the Phone-paid Services Authority (PSA) Code of Practice.\n\nCustomers can get a shock when they discover mobile services they didn't know they had (stock image)\n\nA spokesperson for Vodafone said: \u2018Vodafone, together with all other Mobile Network Operators, insist that aggregators and merchants use a two-step purchase process that adheres to the Phone-paid Services Code of Practise and ensures a customer gives their prior consent before signing up to a subscription-based service.\n\n\u2018In addition, Vodafone also runs a 24/7 advert monitoring service to ensure all adverts across Vodafone are fully compliant and have recently installed a pre-sale traffic monitoring tool, malware and malign programing to protect customers from auto-subscription attempts.\n\n\u2018Vodafone does not receive 30 per cent of the charges people pay. Margins for mobile operators are low and they remain business confidential.\n\n\u2018Vodafone had cause to make the aggregator suspend this merchant in May this year and force a full refund on acquisitions for a full two week period. There is an ongoing investigation on the service. The aggregator partner has terminated the customers subscription and will complete a refund directly onto her Vodafone bill.\u2019\n\nThe PSA, the UK regulator for content, goods and services charged to a phone bill, confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into this company.\n\nBetween February and September this year, it has received 132 complaints about services operated by MobPair.\n\nMost of these are for Play Up \u2013 a games service, and Be Beauty, which seems to be a video streaming service.\n\nA few were unknown, most likely because the consumer who complained to the service didn\u2019t know.\n\nAll of the complaints the PSA received were from Vodafone customers.\n\nA PSA spokesperson said: 'We\u2019re aware that consumers have experienced issues with this service, and are looking into it.\n\nMore generally, we\u2019ve tightened our regulation of these sorts of services. This has included new requirements for phone-paid subscriptions designed to make the process of signing for them up closer to what consumers expect.\n\n\u2018Most phone-paid services operate with few if any problems and deliver for consumers. This includes games, apps, videos, music streaming, donations to charity and entries into TV and radio competitions. Our regulation is aimed at protecting consumers from harm while encouraging innovation and growth.\u2019\n\nOther Vodafone customers have taken to social media to report having similar experiences to Mary with some who have called the number in the text still unable to stop the weekly payments leaving their account.\n\nOn the website Who Called Me?, which aims to identify scam numbers, the number Mary was sent via text which has been named by users as \u2018Dangerous\u2019 with other customers saying they too have been charged for a weekly subscription.\n\nThis Twitter user said that a number of Vodafone customers have been charged for MobPair\n\nAnother user warned that texting stop to the MobPair text doesn't stop the subscription\n\nAnother customer said they were told it was their fault for clicking on links on the internet\n\nOn the site, Who Called Me?, another Vodafone customer reported having the same problem\n\nOn the MobPair website, it says it provides customers with gaming services as well as videos about beauty products.\n\nThe company, which is based in India, claims on its website: 'Mobpair Technologies is one of the most rapidly growing software development company in India with the international footprint in more than 20+ countries.\n\n'We specialize in the Internet advertisements, mobile games development and RTB related software developments.'\n\nThis is Money has contacted the firm for comment.\n\nIt is not just the MobPair service that mobile phone users have complained about, however.\n\nThis is Money previously reported on a subscription text scam called JammitUp where unsuspecting O2 customers were being charged for a gaming service they had never heard of.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has also reported on the numerous scam texts affecting customers all over the country.", "description": "The Vodafone customer said she started receiving text messages from a firm called MobPair but initially ignored them as she thought they were a scam.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
