The government should be thinking of this, not sending them to stadiums,\u201d it quoted a mother as saying.", "description": "Iranian women fans are free to enter a football stadium Thursday for the first time in decades, after FIFA threatened to suspend Iran.", "authors": ["Breitbart Jerusalem"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/football-soccer-women-iran-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
