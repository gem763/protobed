There was an element of grooming.\n\n'They are cynical, exploitative offences. You exploited naive, young girls. This was corruption of young girls for your own sexual gratification.\n\n'Your acts were entirely selfish. You had little regard for their welfare.'", "description": "Abdul Khalid (pictured), 27, from Manchester, told a 12-year-old he wanted 'to do you and your friends', as well as begging a 15-year-old for sex.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19296816-0-image-a-30_1570193218816.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
