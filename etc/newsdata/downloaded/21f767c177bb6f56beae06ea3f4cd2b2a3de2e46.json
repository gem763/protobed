Do you not think those three would improve Manchester United?\n\nTyrone Mings made his England debut this month (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Put the three of them in United\u2019s side and I think they finish top five. I respect Villa, but Ole should buy the three of them.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrazil\u2019s co-host Ally McCoist agreed with the assertion that the Villa trio would improve the United side, but that the bridge in quality to Liverpool and Manchester City would still be huge.\n\n\u2018Of course I do [think the Villa players would improve the Red Devils].\u2019 McCoist said.\n\n\u2018But here\u2019s my question: would those three make Manchester United better? Yes, of course they would.\n\n\u2018But would they make them better so within a year they would challenge Manchester City and Liverpool?\u2019\n\nMcGinn is the one of the three that has been linked with a move to Old Trafford in the past, with the Scot getting the seal of approval from former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nFormer Aston Villa scout Bobby Jenks says that Fergie is confused why the Red Devils didn\u2019t make an approach for the midfielder before the start of the season.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s up there with the best-performing midfielders in the division,\u2019 Jenks told the Athletic.\n\n\u2018Wait until he\u2019s had a year at that level and then we can say more.\n\n\u2018What I do know is that Sir Alex Ferguson is wondering why Manchester United let a talented Scottish boy slip through.\n\n\u2018He\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on him that\u2019s for sure and if he continues the way he is, you can bet he\u2019ll be telling his pals at United, too.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer defends Ed Woodward over Manchester United\u2019s transfer strategy\n\nMORE: Andy Robertson issues warning to Liverpool team-mates ahead of Manchester United clash", "description": "Manchester United should raid Aston Villa for star trio Jack Grealish, John McGinn and Tyrone Mings, believes former Scotland international Alan Brazil.
