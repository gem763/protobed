He was talking about chickens.\n\nIt was May 22, 2002, and Delaware was suffering as a result of a Russian ban on U.S. poultry\u2014a major industry in the small state. Biden, then Delaware\u2019s senior senator and up for re-election, had raised the issue with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and President George W. Bush himself. Biden was one of many upset lawmakers. It wasn\u2019t the first time (or the last) Biden would deal with issue; in 1996, Biden led an effort in the Senate to stop a similar ban from going into effect. By 2002, U.S. poultry was a $40 billion industry, with 38 states involved in production. Russia accounted for 40 percent of all U.S. poultry sales abroad.\n\nBiden had long expressed his suspicions about Vladimir Putin, telling Meet the Press in June 2001 bluntly he did not think the Russian president was trustworthy. Biden was a vocal critic of Russia on a range of national security and foreign policy issues including human rights abuses like the silencing of the press as well as their conduct in the war in Chechnya.\n\nWhile these issues certainly remained, Biden signaled new hope in working with Russia in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Putin was among the first world leaders to speak directly to Bush and offer his country\u2019s support for whatever came next.\n\nThat effort seemed to speed up what had been a warming trend in U.S.\u2013Russian relations, particularly when it came to trade.\n\nIn return for Russia\u2019s assistance, Putin had asked for relief from the 1974 Jackson-Vanik law, a Cold War-era measure that barred normal trade relations with then-communist governments due to their limitations on Jewish emigration. Putin saw the law as obsolete and as an impediment to Russia joining the World Trade Organization.\n\nBy December 2001, the late California Rep. Tom Lantos, a Holocaust survivor and human rights champion, began crafting a bill to graduate Russia from the law and Biden and then-Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) expressed interest in introducing the Senate version.\n\nThree months later, everything got really clucked up.\n\n\u201c I want to let everybody know, I can either be Russia's best friend or worst enemy. \u201d \u2014 Joe Biden\n\nAfter the Bush administration slapped Russian steel with higher tariffs, Russia\u2014though the Kremlin denied they were retaliating at the time\u2014cut off the U.S. poultry market, citing concerns about its safety.\n\nThe ban sent diplomats scrambling. U.S. Ambassador to Russia Alexander Vershbow said the issue became the \u201cthe number one problem in U.S.-Russian relations\u201d at the time, until the agreement to lift it in mid April 2002.\n\n\u201cThis dispute has already caused some harm to our bilateral economic relationship, that's undeniable,\u201d Vershbow said at a press conference in Moscow on March 31, 2002, according to a State Department transcript. \u201cAnd it will also inevitably complicate Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization.\u201d\n\nBiden made it clear, he would not forget and he wouldn\u2019t let the Bush administration either.\n\n\u201cI want to assure Delaware\u2019s poultry producers that the periodic imposition or threat of a ban remains a crucial issue in U.S.-Russian relations, and that it will not be forgotten when President Bush makes his trip to Russia later this spring,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed in the Delaware State News on April 12, after the ban had been lifted. \u201cThe link between international diplomacy and our economic well-being at home has been demonstrated anew.\u201d\n\nBiden has made his record as a respected elder statesman a focal point of his presidential campaign. The trade dispute over chicken also illustrated how Biden balanced his role as a powerful player in the nation\u2019s foreign policy, with the interests of his home state\u2014as well as his willingness to use the levers of power to escalate issues on behalf of his constituents.\n\n\u201cAs Vice President and in the U.S. Senate, Joe Biden proudly fought for American exports and stood up to other countries\u2014including Russia\u2014when they tried to deny American workers, farmers, and businesses their fair shot to compete,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nA month after the op-ed, on the eve of the summit between Bush and Putin, Biden made good on the threat to continue the pressure on the Kremlin, accusing Russian officials of deliberately slow-walking the process of restarting the poultry trade.\n\n\u201cWhen they lifted the embargo, though, they lifted it only in principle,\u201d Biden said in a speech on the Senate floor on May 22 to express his disapproval of a just-passed non-binding \u201csense of the Senate\u201d resolution in support of normalizing trade relations with Moscow.\n\n\u201cI have been one of the guys criticized on this floor for being too supportive of Russia,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut before I can support taking steps, of any form, to lift trade limits on Russia, I want to make sure they have their act in order, and make sure Russia\u2019s commitment to fair and open trade and the rule of law is in the works.\u201d\n\nAfter reiterating he believed that Russia, in principle, that Russia should be graduated from the Jackson-Vanik law, he expressed hope that Russia had \u201cgotten the message.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was told personally that the President of the United States of America is going to raise this issue. Tomorrow it begins,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is going to raise this issue personally with the President of Russia.\u201d\n\nBut, while Biden was instrumental in stopping the momentum to normalize trade with Russia in 2002, nearly a decade later, as vice president he showed he did not hold a grudge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better for America\u2014and presumptuous of me to say this, never tell another man his business or another country their interest\u2014but it\u2019s better for America, and I believe better for Russia to be able to trade with each other under predictable and transparent rules,\u201d Biden said in a speech at Moscow State University in 2011. \u201cAnd that\u2019s also why we\u2019re going to work with Congress to terminate the Jackson-Vanik amendment.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama signed legislation removing Russia from the Jackson-Vanik Act in December 2012.", "description": "Joe was willing to give Vladimir the benefit of the doubt.
