(INPE), which tracks blazes in the Amazon, reported the number of fires detected was up by nearly 50 per cent from the same period in 2018.\n\nThe devastating fires have prompted global concern over the Amazon, which provides 20 per cent of the world\u2019s oxygen supply.\n\nThe largest rainforest in the world, it is vital for slowing down the pace of global warming.\n\nSome of the fires were man made and created by farmers seeking to clear land.\n\nThe fires have lessened in intensity since the crisis attracted international attention in August but some continue to rage, according to WWF.\n\nMr Bolsonaro faced global criticism this summer for his response to the environmental crisis.\n\nCritics said the president had tacitly encouraged farmers and illegal loggers to clear the land.\n\nDuring his speech the far-right leader attacked Emmanuel Macron, the French president, for raising the crisis at a recent G7 summit.\n\nMr Bolsonaro said farmers in the Amazon \u201cno longer want to be treated consistently as if they are cave men or women or prehistoric human beings\u201d, according to NBC News.\n\nThe Brazilian president also said he would like his country to become a member of OPEC, the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe was speaking at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description":
