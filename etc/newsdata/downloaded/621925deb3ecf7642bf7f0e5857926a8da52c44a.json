At this point, it looks very likely that we are going to continue to bounce around in this market, and if you squint you can see an uptrend line. At this point, it\u2019s likely that we could go looking towards the 50 day EMA which is near the $56 level. If we can break above there, then it\u2019s likely that the market goes looking towards the $58 level which is the 200 day EMA. Ultimately, if we break down below the hammer from the trading session on Thursday, then it\u2019s likely that we go down towards the $52.50 level.\n\nCrude Oil Inventories Video 16.09.19\n\nBrent\n\nBrent markets also have fallen during the trading session but still look likely to find buyers in this general vicinity. If we can break down below the hammer from the Thursday session though, that is a very negative sign and probably signifies that we are going to go much lower. Alternately, we could bounce from here for a short-term relief rally but I think there is still a lot of downward pressure on this market. Brent markets are much more sensitive to global demand as opposed to American, so that gives us a chance at seeing some type of divergence between the two markets. With that, I believe that the WTI will probably outperform.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The crude oil markets have gone back and forth during the trading session on Friday as it looks like we are trying to find bits of support after a massive selloff. There has been an extraordinarily large amount of noise in the market over the last couple of weeks, and that looks to be more of the same", "authors": ["Christopher Lewis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
