You don\u2019t need to scream at me this way,\u201d Navarro shot back. Seemingly thrown off by Navarro\u2019s reaction, McCain replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you just said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t scream at me. I\u2019m two feet away,\u2019\u201d repeated Navarro to the sound of gasps from the audience. Co-host Joy Behar attempted to smooth things over by taking the show to commercial, but McCain could be heard saying, \u201cThat\u2019s so rude, Ana.\u201d McCain added, \u201cWelcome back,\u201d referring to Navarro\u2019s absence from the Hot Topics Table this season.\n\nAs the show went to break, McCain could be seen storming off set to looks of shock from the studio audience.\n\nAfter the show, McCain took to Twitter to assure fans she\u2019s doing just fine:\n\nViewers were divided over the heated exchange between McCain and Navarro. Some tweeted they were happy to see Navarro clap back at McCain\u2019s \u201cexcuse me\u201d exclamation:\n\nAnna is so real. I'm glad she checked @MeghanMcCain. She's not afraid of her like the other ladies. \u2014 Sally bell (@Sallybe64964873) September 20, 2019\n\nOthers defended McCain, and said Navarro should have been more respectful considering she was a guest on the show:\n\n@TheView Anna Navarro comes on your show intermittently. Not a regular. She needs to be far more respectful to those whose show she\u2019s a GUEST on. Her aggression towards Megan McCain is disgusting! Never enjoy a show when she\u2019s on. \u2014 Michele Sobering \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@MicheleSobering) September 20, 2019\n\nHold your tomatoes, but I like that Meghan is on the show. She makes for good TV. Very entertaining. I dont want just one side. I like that fact that there's a Dem & a Repub POV. Where's the Indep. POV?..Yes she can get...lemony...for lack of a better word but she's great fodder. \u2014 Woman just Gail (@Bossanovalady76) September 20, 2019\n\nTamera Mowry-Housley reveals she's in therapy after her niece is killed in mass shooting:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "\"The View\" co-host Meghan McCain stormed off set in front of a shocked audience after a tense standoff with guest panelist Ana Navarro.", "authors": ["Todd Garrin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZzM16s9ru5bjNt8z4j0M.A--~B/aD0xNDU0O3c9MzM0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/bd7281f0-dbe6-11e9-b76f-84d411b61625", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
