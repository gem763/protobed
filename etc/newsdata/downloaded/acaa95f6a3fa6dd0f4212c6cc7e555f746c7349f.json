This was followed by fighting between rival clans and an Islamist insurgency.\n\nAl Qaeda-aligned Al Shabaab, which seeks to topple the U.N.-backed government, often launches attacks in Mogadishu and across the country. It did not immediately claim responsibility for Sunday\u2019s attack and could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Somali government could also not be reached for comment.\n\nResidents living near the airport told Reuters several mortar bombs were fired at the compound. The diplomatic source said six people were injured after three mortar bombs were fired.\n\n\u201cI am appalled by this blatant act of terrorism against our personnel...Thankfully, the majority of our staff is unhurt,\u201d U.N. envoy James Swan said in a statement.\n\nAl Shabaab has been trying for years to oust the central government and implement its strict version of Islamic law. It was driven out of the capital in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some regions including South West.", "description": "At least three mortar bombs were fired on Sunday at Mogadishu\u2019s international airport, injuring at least six people in the compound where several embassies are located, a diplomatic source said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
