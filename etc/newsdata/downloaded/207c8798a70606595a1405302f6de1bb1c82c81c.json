(Ashley Burke/CBC News)\n\nOpioids, when prescribed and used appropriately, are for managing pain. But they are also used to produce a high that can lead to hospitalization, death and opioid-use disorders. From January 2016 to June 2018, more than 9,000 Canadians died from apparent opioid-related harms, which the government has called a crisis.\n\nFollowing high-profile coroners' cases in Ontario, the first version of Canadian opioid prescribing guidelines were released in 2010. It moved physicians away from increasing doses without a ceiling.\n\nThe 2017 update stressed non-pharmacological options such as exercise, pacing and lifestyle changes before trying non-opioid analgesics followed by opioids.\n\nDr. Norm Buckley, a professor emeritus of anesthesia at McMaster University in Hamilton, said the roots of the crisis trace back to 2007, when it was first recognized that prescription opioids were seeping into the illicit drug market.\n\nHe says other potential contributors to the decline in prescribing include:\n\nAn investigation by the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Ontario of 80 physicians identified as high prescribers, which made others anxious about the implications of prescribing opioids.\n\nBritish Columbia instituting a prescribing standard, which has been revised, that also focused attention on physician-prescribed opioids.\n\nTwo strongly worded prescribing guidelines that were published in the U.S. in 2017.\n\n\"The decline in prescribing is a somewhat predictable result of a push to reduce prescribing, which in part was warranted I think, and in part was perhaps an over swing of the pendulum,\" said Buckley, who is also scientific director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Pain Research and Care. He was not involved in the CIHI report.\n\nBuckley said about 15 to 20 per cent of the population experiences chronic pain, such as muscloskeletal low back pain, headache and arthritic conditions. Some chronic pain patients who benefit from their prescribed opioids have said they face misunderstanding at pharmacies and emergency departments because of the stigma associated with opioids.\n\nAccording to the report, fewer people took opioids on a long-term basis \u2014 from 19.8 per cent to 17.6 per cent during that five-year span. (Long-term use was defined as prescribing for 90 days in a 100-day period.)\n\nCIHI said it is challenging to attribute the prescribing trends to specific initiatives since so many have been implemented across the country at different times.\n\nThe data in the report covers 60 per cent of Canada's population. But the findings exclude Quebec, where fewer opioids are prescribed. Buckley said one reason for that might be that Quebec is about 10 years ahead of other provinces in developing a strategy to provide pain care.\n\nDuring the study period, opioid prescribing rates in Saskatchewan started lower than the other provinces and remained consistently lower. The declines in opioid prescribing were similar in B.C, Manitoba and Ontario, approaching Saskatchewan's.\n\nSince Manitoba's data was only available since 2016, it was excluded from calculations on previous years.", "description": "About eight per cent fewer people in Ontario, Saskatchewan and British Columbia were prescribed opioids in 2018 than in 2013, an encouraging trend in the opioid crisis, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4876441.1561658099!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/newborn-opioids-outcomes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
