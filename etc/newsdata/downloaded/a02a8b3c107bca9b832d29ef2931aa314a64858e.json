An M.I.T. study last year found that nearly 50 percent of nonunion workers say they would vote to join a union if they could, up from 32 percent in 1995.\n\nFrom the moment the G.M. walkout started, union leaders said the strike was bigger than just G.M. \u201cToday, we stand strong and say with one voice, we are standing up for our members and for the fundamental rights of working-class people in this nation,\u201d Terry Dittes, a United Auto Workers vice president, said. The autoworkers are taking a page from the teachers, who made it clear that they were striking not just because they were tired of pay freezes but also to help their students, by increasing education budgets, reducing class sizes and replacing obsolete textbooks.\n\nWith many Americans angry about factories moving overseas, the autoworkers union also wants G.M. to reopen its giant plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The company closed the plant because demand for Chevy Cruzes had declined, even as it has kept open its plant in Mexico that makes the same car. And with many workers upset about the increased instability and precariousness of their jobs, the union is also pressing G.M. to stop using so many temps \u2014 they represent 7 percent of the company\u2019s work force and make just $15 an hour.\n\nDonald Trump won the 2016 election partly because many workers thought the system was rigged against them. That sentiment is also fueling the G.M. strike. The company had $8.1 billion in profits worldwide last year and $35 billion in North America over the last three years, so workers are resentful that the company nonetheless wants to close plants \u2014 especially when union members made major concessions, like creating a two-tier wage structure at some plants, to help lift the company out of bankruptcy.\n\nBut General Motors insists that it has already made a generous offer, saying it offered to add 5,400 jobs and make more than $7 billion in new investments in plants in the United States. \u201cWe have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency,\u201d G.M. said. \u201cOur goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business.\u201d", "description": "How teachers, hotel workers and supermarket cashiers inspired 50,000 General Motors workers to go on strike.", "authors": ["Steven Greenhouse"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/opinion/17Greenhouse1/17Greenhouse1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
