Warren and some American Indians consider his usage a slur. In February, she apologized to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to show that she has Native American ancestry.\n\nTrump attacked Democrats\u2019 proposals on health care, the environment and energy. He said that with windmills generating electricity, viewers wouldn\u2019t be able to watch Democrats debate if the wind wasn\u2019t blowing.\n\nTrump\u2019s speech began late, starting just as 10 Democrats began a televised debate in Houston.\n\nThere, Senator Kamala Harris began by speaking directly to Trump, saying he\u2019s governed with hate, intimidation and fear and \u201cthe American people are so much better than this.\u201d\n\nThursday was the president\u2019s first time in Baltimore after he attacked the city as a \u201crat and rodent infested mess\u201d over the summer.\n\nLocal groups protested Trump\u2019s visit amid lingering anger over the president\u2019s comments. Trump began criticizing the city amid a dispute over immigration with Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, whose Maryland district includes part of Baltimore.\n\nOver a series of days, Trump suggested without evidence that political leaders in Baltimore were corrupt and had stolen billions in federal dollars, described the city as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d and claimed \u201cno human being would want to live there.\u201d\n\nCritics said the president\u2019s language was racist, a charge the president subsequently lobbed at Democratic opponents. Cummings, who is chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, last month called for \u201cthose in the highest level\u201d of government to stop using \u201cracist language\u201d that divides Americans and said Trump should visit his city.\n\nRepublicans selected Baltimore as the site for their annual retreat before the president\u2019s comments denigrating the city.\n\n(Updates with background on Trump\u2019s use of the Pocahontas name, in fourth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jordan Fabian in Washington at jfabian6@bloomberg.net;Justin Sink in Washington at jsink1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Justin Blum, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump did his best to join Democrats on the debate stage Thursday night, assailing several of his would-be 2020 opponents during a speech to Republican lawmakers in Baltimore.He once again derided Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d and former Vice President", "authors": ["Jordan Fabian", "Justin Sink"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jd_2pfaltV9XrPsft3ftQw--~B/aD0xMzM1O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/4ec1bb4eb67a7a2d4bab1221ba11bfbc", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
