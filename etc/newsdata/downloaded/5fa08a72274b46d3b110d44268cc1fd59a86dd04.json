More pertinently, however, he was in charge in 2007 \u2013 the last time before Saturday that New Zealand lost a World Cup match, against France in the quarter-finals.\n\nEngland stride past All Blacks towards rugby\u2019s greatest prize Read more\n\nTheir chat centred on how to deal with a defeat when coaching a country that expects nothing short of success. But it was also telling that George Ford was one of their main topics of conversation. \u201cI talked to Ted [Henry] and had a chat about 2007,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cWe mentioned the fact that it\u2019s no different. It was a gutting feeling. Then Ted and I spoke about how well George Ford had played. I thought George Ford played particularly well and put us into positions where we had to really work to try to get out of deep in our own territory and try to force things.\u201d\n\nHansen also waxed lyrical about Maro Itoje but the fact he singled out Ford is significant, given how he has flitted in and out of England\u2019s team of late. For Ford must take immense credit for how he handled being dropped to the bench against Australia before his return to face the All Blacks. In public both he and Jones have insisted that he was not dropped, just given a different role, but Ford did not grow up dreaming of wearing No 22 for England at a World Cup.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England\u2019s George Ford makes a smart offload before as he is tackled by two All Blacks.

We got all that stuff out from 2015 and since then, we\u2019ve moved forward, we\u2019ve cracked on, we haven\u2019t looked back or spoken about it once. It was important that we got it out of our system, but as soon as it was done and dusted, we moved on.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve beaten the god of rugby but we still must improve, says Eddie Jones Read more\n\nClearly Ford feels more valued in Jones\u2019s regime, even if he has spent plenty of time on the bench. Indeed, he has been in all but one of Jones\u2019s 49 matchday squads and there is significance to the Test he missed. It was against South Africa in Cape Town in 2018 \u2013 the only time Jones has started Danny Cipriani. It is a testament to Ford\u2019s response to that and his ability to shut out all the hype that followed when Cipriani\u2019s excellent kick set up Jonny May for the decisive try. And Ford\u2019s renewed form since certainly chimes with Jones pinpointing that tour as a pivotal moment for his team.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the evolution of this team, it started on the South Africa tour,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe had a fairly solid team for the first two years, and we knew we had to make changes to regenerate and reinvigorate. It started in South Africa.\u201d\n\nAgainst New Zealand, Ford did not miss a beat. His kicking from hand was excellent and at goal equally impressive after taking over from Farrell, whose injury meant he could not carry out the role. \u201cI spoke to Owen straight away,\u201d said Ford. \u201cHe said he had a dead leg and was fine to carry on. We both practise together in the week as much as possible in case anything like that happens.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Like George Ford, Maro Itoje was praised by the All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen, for his display in the 19-7 semi-final win. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nFord did not miss a beat after the match, either. Jones has suggested he would have no issue dropping the fly-half again, no doubt a comment designed to keep his players on their toes because the last thing he wants England to do is pat themselves on the back. France memorably got carried away after beating the All Blacks in the 1999 semi-final and Ford was adamant England would not fall into the same trap.\n\n\u201cThe feeling now is that we\u2019ve given ourselves an opportunity \u2013 that is literally all it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came into the game with huge belief, we came in thinking we could win. We had to be somewhere pretty good to near our best to do so. We\u2019ve got one opportunity now to finish it off. We want to enjoy the win, but we understand what is ahead of us and it is an opportunity for us.\u201d", "description": "England fly-half George Ford focused on finishing the job as Eddie Jones\u2019s team prepare to face South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8855104154691a09f484ec1620878b277d030d40/0_115_3436_2062/master/3436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a878809a479d70bb36f0d09372f20e42", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
