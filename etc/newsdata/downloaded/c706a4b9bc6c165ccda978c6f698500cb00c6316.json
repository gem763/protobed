It is your freedom to wear it because it\u2019s you wearing it, but when you put a flag on a fa\u00e7ade, that belongs to a community of neighbours, then your freedom is invading my freedom.\u201d\n\nA recent survey showed Catalan people are virtually split down the middle between those who support independence and those who want to remain part of Spain, but 70% of them agree is now time for some sort of mutual understanding when it comes to the political signs.\n\nCarmen Sur\u00eds, a local resident in Barcelona, told Euronews: \u201cI think we are all tired of the war of flags. We shouldn't show off any external signage.\u201d\n\nBut Mila Lopez, a Barcelona resident, thinks the issue runs deeper than that: \u201cI think this is going in the same direction.\n\n\"I don\u2019t mean in Catalonia, but in Spain, they are forbidding and suppressing more and more civil rights.\n\n\"We have less and less freedom, so I am going to keep my flag on my balcony, a separatist flag of course.\"\n\nMarcos Benari\u00e9, another resident, said some neighbourhoods experienced tensions over the flags: \u201cIn my building, there's the case of a neighbour who has pro-independence flags and he doesn't want to remove them.\n\n\"And there is some tension as some people want to display a Spanish flag. They won't do it because that would mean ending up engaging in conflict.\u201d\n\nReports suggest almost half the new lease contracts signed in Barcelona are restricting tenants from displaying flags on their balconies.\n\nThe war of flags has also reached the balconies and fa\u00e7ades of public buildings like the Regional Government of Catalonia.\n\nThe electoral commission has requested that the Catalan premier remove all signage ahead of the upcoming general elections in Spain.\n\nWatch Good Morning Europe's report in the player above.", "description": "A war of flags has taken over Barcelona's balconies with both pro and anti-independence supporters using their outside spaces to make clear where they stand on Catalonia's secession debate.", "authors": ["Joao Vitor Da Silva Marques"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/61/16/1000x563_cmsv2_563953c2-bdf9-57f0-adbd-948b8402c5cc-4216116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
