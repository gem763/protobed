Short of a majority in parliament, the premier\u2019s efforts to coax Gantz\u2019s Blue and White bloc, the largest in the legislature, into a power-sharing agreement have so far failed.\n\n\u201cAll of Israel\u2019s citizens look around and see how the Middle East is changing for the worse in front of our eyes,\u201d Netanyahu said Thursday in a tweet. \u201cThose who need to know, know that the security challenges are growing, and they are not waiting for us.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister didn\u2019t specify the threats facing Israel. But his statement follows the decision by President Donald Trump to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria as he seeks to end America\u2019s presence in long-running Middle Eastern conflicts.\n\nThe U-turn has boosted Israel\u2019s main regional foe, Iran, which is a key supporter of the government in Damascus, and stoked speculation in Israel over the future reliability of the country\u2019s superpower patron.\n\nGantz quickly rejected Netanyahu\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cI received a proposal today that one must refuse,\u2019\u2019 Gantz said in a tweet. \u201cWe will wait for the President\u2019s mandate and begin serious negotiations for the establishment of a liberal unity government that will lead to change and restore hope to the citizens of Israel.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Ivan Levingston.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Yaacov Benmeleh in Tel Aviv at ybenmeleh@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaa Shahine at asalha@bloomberg.net, Mark Williams, Paul Abelsky\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s main rival turned down the Israeli prime minister\u2019s renewed call to set aside political differences and join a national unity governmentNetanyahu has until late next week to form a ruling coalition or risk the country\u2019s president handing the mandate to former military", "authors": ["Yaacov Benmeleh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Runpdn3OKJk2r8yCRdTpNQ--~B/aD0xNDQyO3c9MjE2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/02b738517010a8862254b4693fdc13f2", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
