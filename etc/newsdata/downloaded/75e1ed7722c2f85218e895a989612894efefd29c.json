And while fans and pundits may fuel that narrative even further, we have steadily seen technical improvements from the 33-year-old since his initial move to Alliance MMA.\n\nMixing in a healthy dose of feints to his footwork, Stephens has added to the effectiveness of his pressuring approach. Incorporating more kicks into his repertoire, the Iowa native will smartly work in assaults to both the body and legs of his opposition once establishing his range.\n\nOver the past few years, we\u2019ve seen Stephens attack opponents legs with impunity from the opening bell. More specifically, we saw Stephens target their lower leg extremities with calf kicks, a tactic that has been growing in popularity in recent years.\n\nTargeting the tibial region of the leg is not only a painful attack that\u2019s difficult to defend against, but it is also harder to counter off of given the flexibility of range that it allows for the attacker. Although these attacks could serve Stephens well give his current counterpart\u2019s length, sharp strikers who can stick, move and counter have traditionally been Stephens\u2019 common culprit in losses.\n\nEnter Yair Rodriguez.\n\nA dynamic, storm-riding striker, Rodriguez unabashedly translates his taekwondo skills at a high level. From front kicks to aerial assaults, Rodriguez can execute high-wire offense at the drop of a dime. And though this style of fighting can require a fair share of space, the 27-year-old talent has done a better job of incorporating more punches into his repertoire.\n\nUp until his last outing, you could argue that Rodriguez \u2013 despite his dazzling displays and ability to switch stances \u2013 was a one-sided fighter, primarily relying on his right side to attack. However, as we saw in his fight with Chan Sung Jung, Rodriguez has made use of his lengthy stints between fights, demonstrating much better boxing fundamentals than before.\n\nWhether he was throwing counter crosses from southpaw or hitting check hooks out of his orthodox stance, Rodriguez has become much more adept at using his left hand. That said, the original \u201cTUF: Latin America\u201d winner still showed some defensive holes in the pocket during his war with \u2018The Korean Zombie\u201d that Stephens will likely try his hand at any time he steps into the eye of the storm.\n\nNext point of interest: Wrestling warfare", "description": "MMA Junkie fight analyst Dan Tom takes a closer look at the UFC on ESPN 6 co-main event between Yair Rodriguez and Jeremy Stephens.", "authors": ["Dan Tom", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/yair-rodriguez-jeremy-stephens-ufc-on-espn-plus-17-breakdown.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
