It causes cholesterol to build-up in the neurons.\n\nNPC leads to enlarged organs, lung damage, muscle stiffness, seizures, dementia and difficulty speaking.\n\nMarian's parents Sara, 36, and Paul, 35, say she wouldn't have made it to the age of four without the help of the drug known as VTS-270.\n\nMarian McGlockin, four, was diagnosed with deadly Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) at just 18 months old\n\nHer parents were warned she would lose her ability to talk, eat, walk, move, or even remember them\n\nMarian's parents Sara, 36, and Paul, 35, say she wouldn't have made it to the age of four without the help of the drug known as VTS-270.

The disorder is incurable.\n\nHer parents were warned she would lose her ability to talk, eat, walk, move, or even remember them.\n\nBut the youngster, from California, is now dancing, playing and thriving at pre-school against the odds.\n\nHer parents say she quickly showed vast improvements after taking part of a clinical trial of VTS-270, which is under review by Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThe drug is injected into the spine of NPC sufferers and helps their bodies break down cholesterol clogging up their neurons.\n\nMrs McGlockin, a mother-of-two, said: 'Marian has come on leaps and bounds over the past two years.\n\n'She started learning to walk soon after starting to take the drug and even enjoys ballet classes now.\n\nMarian's parents took her to the doctors at the age of six months (pictured as a baby) when they noticed a stunt in her growth\n\nMedics noticed she had an enlarged spleen - which eventually led to her diagnosis a year later\n\nDoctors told the family to prepare for the worst as the disease - dubbed 'childhood Alzheimer's' - normally kills in 10 to 15 years\n\nHer parents say she showed vast improvements since taking part of a clinical trial of VTS-270, which is under review by Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n\nThe family say since starting on the medication, 'it's like it turned the lights on inside her and she really began to shine'\n\n'In terms of her awareness and cognitive ability, she's where she should be for a four-year-old which is amazing as previously she was showing early signs of childhood dementia.\n\n'We were terrified Marian would lose her ability to talk, eat, walk, move, and remember us.\n\nWHAT IS NIEMANN-PICK DISEASE TYPE C (NPC)? The rare disease sees patients unable to metabolise cholesterol and other lipids properly within their cells. Excessive amounts of cholesterol then accumulate within the liver and spleen, and excessive amounts of other lipids accumulate in the brain. Signs and symptoms: Vertical gaze palsy (the inability to move the eyes up and down)\n\nEnlarged liver\n\nEnlarged spleen\n\nJaundice in young children In most cases, neurological symptoms begin appearing between the ages of four and 10. Generally, the later that neurological symptoms begin, the slower the progression of the disease. NPC causes enlarged organs, lung damage, and slow and steady neurological deterioration. Patients are eventually unable to walk, talk or even breathe. There are an estimated 500 cases diagnosed worldwide. Doctors say there may be more, but that people confuse the disease with a learning disability or clumsiness. There is currently no cure for NPC. Half of children die by age 10 and the majority will die before age 20. A late onset of symptoms can lead to a longer life span, but it is extremely rare for any person with NPC to reach age 40.

The cholesterol build-up affects organs other than the brain, such as the liver and the spleen, but neurological symptoms are often the first warning sign.\n\nThe age that symptoms begin to show up varies a lot between sufferers, but learning delays and clumsiness often emerge in early childhood.\n\nThose symptoms are followed by progressive loss of brain function, including loss of motor control, hearing, speech and cognition.\n\nMost patients die 10 to 15 years after onset of the symptoms. NPC causes cholesterol to become trapped in cellular compartments called lysosomes.\n\nCyclodextrin - a chemical found in VTS-270 - appears to release it. The cholesterol can then be metabolised and removed from the cell.\n\nThere have been conflicting studies on VTS-270, which is owned by UK-based pharmaceutical firm Mallinckrodt.\n\nIt has not been approved in the UK due to failing a trial in November 2018, which found it was no more effective than a placebo.\n\nThe McGlocklin family are fundraising in the hope of accelerating research for NPC and supporting patient access to treatment.
