A gas station off Route 285 bustles with workers in boots and baseball caps. Residents fret about the crumbling road, which has been pummeled by trucks barreling in and out of the oilfields. There\u2019s nothing to suggest the distress that\u2019s mounting in the busiest U.S. oil and gas region.\n\nAbout 500 miles east, Houston is abuzz about another slump on the way. Restructuring expert Jay Haber, for one, has been fielding call after call from New York with banks, hedge funds and private equity sponsors having to decide whether to sink more money into souring wells or cut their losses.\n\n\u201cPeople were far too quick to save basically broke companies in 2015 and 2016,\u201d said Haber, a Houston-based adviser at turnaround shop Getzler Henrich & Associates LLC and 30-year veteran of the energy business. \u201cHad oil gone to $80 or $90, things would be better.\u201d\n\nMoney managers who specialize in distressed assets followed time-tested turnaround strategies in the Permian Basin, but for many of them, it\u2019s not working. Instead, oil and gas bankruptcies this year are coming at the fastest clip since 2016, according to data from the Haynes & Boone LLP law firm. \u201cChapter 22s,\u201d or repeat filings by the same company, are also on the rise as capital markets have slammed shut for troubled energy companies.\n\nEnergy investing is an inherently volatile exercise, with the fate of companies and investments largely determined by commodity markets and the global economy. When the price of crude dropped from 2014 to 2016 to the lowest in a decade, more than $130 billion of private capital was raised to bargain hunt for energy investments whose value would rise when oil rebounded, according to Preqin.\n\nFor those still solvent, oil remains stuck around $55 a barrel -- too low for weak companies to make money. The outlook isn\u2019t great either as the U.S. and China trade barbs over tariffs and predictions of a U.S. recession multiply.\n\nOutside Money\n\nLocal bankers and investors in Texas who have built careers in \u201cthe patch\u201d say the stress stems not only from the flagging price of oil, but also from outside investors who didn\u2019t understand the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d never heard of many of these people,\u201d said Lance Gurley, a restructuring banker for Stephens Inc. in Dallas. \u201cIt was a wave of investors who had never touched the energy market before.\u201d\n\nThey were following their usual playbook: buy the debt of companies in financial distress and hold onto it through a bankruptcy, converting the stake to equity and seizing control. Or, for private equity investors, buy unwanted assets or companies, replace the management teams and look for a buyer.\n\n\u201cFor certain financially troubled producers wounded by the crash in 2015, some stakeholders may have given up hope that resurgent commodity prices will bail everyone out,\u201d according to the Haynes & Boone oil and gas bankruptcy report for August. \u201cFor these producers, the game clock has run out of time to keep playing \u2018kick the can\u2019 with their creditors and other stakeholders.\u201d\n\nInsular World\n\nFor Adam Flikerski, an important part of spotting winners is being immersed in Texas\u2019 energy community. After starting his career in New York, he moved to Houston in 2006 to co-found Blackgold Capital Management LP, which specializes in energy investments and counts KKR & Co. as a shareholder.\n\nA deal he is working on now came about because his daughter goes to school with the chief executive\u2019s daughter. While the number-crunching is important, investors sometimes just need to know \u201cwho has the good rock\u201d that will yield the highest production at the lowest cost, he said. His firm manages about $1 billion of assets.\n\nFlikerski and other Texas-based professionals said the companies filing for bankruptcy this year never had great assets, or have capital structures that are unsustainable with oil in the $50 range.\n\n\u201cMost firms with serious E&P efforts have a presence in Texas to cover local relationships,\u201d Stephens\u2019 Gurley said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re not at the cafe store in Midland, if you\u2019re not at the petroleum club in Houston, you may miss opportunities.\u201d\n\nInvesting in the Permian basin requires not only understanding how to value assets and read reserve reports, but also how to drill wells properly, Getzler\u2019s Haber said. One client who sought his help had invested in a pool of loans to companies that were having problems, including having drilled wells too close together and producing less oil than expected -- \u201ctoo many straws in the Coca-Cola,\u201d as he put it. Successful investment firms often have a geologist and reserve engineer on staff.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Oil wells jet out of the scrubby, dusty ground in West Texas\u2019 Permian Basin as far as the eye can see.
