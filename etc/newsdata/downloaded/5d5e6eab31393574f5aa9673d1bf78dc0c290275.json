The group appointed its board of directors: Facebook\u2019s head of its cryptocurrency Calibra team David Marcus, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Katie Haun, Xapo\u2019s Wences Cesares, Kiva Microsystems\u2019 Matthew Davie, and PayU\u2019s Patrick Ellis. Marcus\u2019 inclusion should be no surprise given he\u2019s been the public face of Libra, even though his former company PayPal pulled out of the Association. Marcus writes that he\u2019s \u201chonored to have been voted in\u201d\n\nAnother former PayPal\u2019er Bertrand Perez was formally named the Libra Association\u2019s COO and Interim Managing Director after unofficially holding these titles. The former senior director of payments engineering at PayPal is now also the chairperson of Libra\u2019s five-member board and full-membership council. \u201cWe have no vocation to play the pirates\u201d he told news outlet Revyuh last month, noting \u201cif, for example, the European Central Bank still refuses us the right to operate in Europe, we will not do it, we do not intend to play the pirates, we respect the legislation.\u201d\n\nLibra\u2019s head of communications and policy Dante Disparte formerly of Risk Cooperative and head of business development Kurt Hemecker formerly of Zong had their roles confirmed too.\n\nThe remaining Libra Association members listed below signed the Libra charter. They\u2019ve agreed that members can leave for any reason, and with some restrictions transfer their membership plus $10 million in Libra Investment Tokens stake to another eligible organization.\n\nPayments: PayU (Naspers\u2019 fintech arm)\n\nTechnology and marketplaces: Facebook/Calibra, Farfetch, Lyft, Spotify AB, Uber Technologies, Inc.\n\nTelecommunications: Iliad, Vodafone Group\n\nBlockchain: Anchorage, Bison Trails, Coinbase, Inc., Xapo Holdings Limited\n\nVenture Capital: Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Union Square Ventures\n\nNonprofit and multilateral organizations, and academic institutions: Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women\u2019s World Banking\n\nNo Longer Members: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe, Booking Holdings, eBay, Mercado Pago\n\nThe Libra Association did not announce any changes in strategy or other plans that could help the organization assuage regulators\u2019 fears. One path suggested by Libra Association member Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s partner Chris Dixon was to move to Libra being denominated in U.S. dollars rather than being pegged to a basket of international currencies. That might quiet concerns about Libra potentially competing directly with the US dollar.\n\nThis leaves the reveal of the 180 potential members as the biggest news from the meeting. A Libra Association spokeperson writes:\n\n\u201cSince the Libra project was announced on June 18th, 2019, it has generated excitement around the world. the Libra Association confriemd that over 1,500 entities have indicated interest in joining the Libra project effort, and approximately 180 entities have met the preliminary membership criteria shared at Libra.org.\u201d\n\nThose requirements include businesses hitting two of three thresholds of a $1 billion USD market value or $500 million in customer balances, reaching 20 million people a year, or being recognized as a top 100 industry leader. There are other criteria for cryptocurrencies businesses, non-profits, and universities.\n\nHowever, we don\u2019t have information on when the interest of those 1500 potential partners was tallied. The withdrawl of Mastercard, PayPal, and more, comments from regulators intent on blocking the currency, and Marcus\u2019 tense questioning on Capitol Hill could have since scared off some would-be allies.\n\nMarcus and Perez face an uphill battle to get Libra to market. Not only do they have to prove it\u2019s safeguarded against fraud, moneylaundering, and hurting sovereign currencies. They also must tangle with the toxic brand Facebook has developed over the years. Legislators who feel like the social network is too big are seizing on their second chance to constrain it with Libra.", "description": "Attempting to signal its popularity despite high-profile defections from Visa, Stripe, and more, the Facebook-led cryptocurrency Libra Assocation announced that 1,500 organizations have expressed interest in joining the Libra project. 180 of those meet eligibility requirements to become members, which could replace the 7 companies that dropped out of the Association this month including Kayak [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/David-Marcus-Libra-Association.png?w=739", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
