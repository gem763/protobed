He proudly calls Treasury the most self-distributed wine company in the world.\n\nFatter margins\n\nBypassing the distributors in China, who take a margin of up to 60 per cent, means Treasury\u2019s own margins are stronger than its rivals. Its Asian margin in 2018-19 was 39.2 per cent, up 170 basis points, and almost double its margin in the US.\n\nSo during this period of destocking, where the big distributors are getting caught with too much inventory, TWE can afford to maintain spending on marketing (particularly via what Clarke calls key opinion leaders) and so-called pull through promotions, which typically involve offering giving consumer a wine glass or two with their bottle of plonk.\n\nThe elevated marketing spending helps entrench TWE\u2019s wines in consumers' minds. And this helps generate sales for Chinese retailers who might be doing it tougher in an economy hit by trade tensions.\n\n\u201cOur product in retail stores is converting to cash quicker than any other brand,\u201d Clarke tells Chanticleer.\n\nDefending channel-stuffing allegations\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuesday\u2019s investor day was very much about highlighting TWE\u2019s growth trajectory over the past five years, which has seen group EBIT increase from $225 million to $663 million, its EBIT margin rise from 12.1 per cent to 23.4 per cent, and TWE\u2019s stock price jump by almost 300 per cent.\n\nBut the Chinese market is also home to one of the big controversies around Treasury\u2019s growth over the period: persistent allegations that it has engaged in \u201cchannel stuffing\u201d in China.\n\nThe claims stem from what Clarke calls TWE's portfolio approach to imports. This means Chinese retailers who want to get their hands on a shipping container filled with lots of the top-selling Penfolds brand also need to buy other TWE brands.\n\nClarke says this is to ensure Treasury doesn\u2019t end up with all its eggs in the Penfolds basket. But it\u2019s led to claims TWE has effectively forced its less popular brands on retailers who really don\u2019t want them \u2013 and this has inflated TWE\u2019s Asian sales.\n\nClarke has a passionate three-point defence to the claims.\n\nFirstly, Treasury allocates its wine vintages over a five-year cycle that is fully audited, and not tampered with to suddenly dump stock. Secondly, its direct-to-retail approach means it couldn\u2019t channel stuff even if it wanted to, as retailers always want to keep stock levels low. Finally, shipments of wine and depletions from inventory are in balance.\n\nThe channel stuffing noise clearly grates with Clarke. But he concedes that Treasury\u2019s Chinese selling strategy isn\u2019t perfect and he says North Asia boss Tom King will work more closely with Chinese retailers to lift sales across TWE\u2019s portfolio.\n\nKing will do this, in part, by developing joint business plans with retailers \u2013 a strategy popular in Europe, where King was previously posted.\n\nClarke is also expanding Treasury\u2019s warehouse model in China. This will lessen the need for sales of containers full of wine \u2013 which take up to eight weeks to get to China, and are sold on credit terms of 90 days \u2013 and give TWE the ability to deliver smaller, more bespoke orders on credit terms of 45 days.", "description": "Michael Clarke's strategy of dodging the wine industry's middlemen is helping it win in a Chinese economy hit by the trade war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.773%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4223696675f28507dfd5ed2be9f3e4783d57eaa3", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
