It has allowed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to redeploy his forces to an area that had been beyond his control for years in the more than eight-year Syrian war.\n\nSyrian troops accompanied by Russian forces entered the city of Kobani, a strategically important border city and a potential flashpoint for a wider conflict, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the Syrian war, reported.\n\nSpeaking to reporters as he met Italian President Sergio Mattarella and then at a joint news conference, Trump said the Kurds were \u201cnot angels\u201d and that it might be necessary for Russian-backed Syria and Turkey to \u201cfight it out.\u201d\n\nFIGHT FOR LAND\n\n\u201cOur soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way - as they shouldn\u2019t be, as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us,\u201d Trump said during Oval Office talks with Mattarella where he sounded as if he were washing his hands of the conflict.\n\nHe also defended his move to get U.S. troops out as part of his wider effort to bring Americans home from \u201cendless wars,\u201d despite being excoriated by members of his own Republican Party. U.S officials say, however, that those troops were expected to be repositioned in the region. Some of them could go to Iraq.\n\n\u201cI viewed the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be for the United States strategically brilliant,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a lot of sand,\u201d he later said. \u201cSo you have Syria and you have Turkey. They\u2019re going to argue it out, maybe they\u2019re going to fight it out. But our men aren\u2019t going to get killed over it.\u201d\n\nActing last week after a phone call on Oct. 6 with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Trump abruptly upended five years of U.S. policy with his decision to withhold protection from Syria\u2019s Kurds and to withdraw first about 50 special operations forces and then the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops in northern Syria.\n\n\u201cThis is a mistake worse than what (Barack) Obama did\u201d when the former president withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham, usually among Trump\u2019s strongest supporters, told reporters.\n\nThe White House, fighting the domestic political damage and perhaps trying to demonstrate the president\u2019s efforts to stop Turkey\u2019s onslaught, released an Oct. 9 Trump letter to Erdogan that said: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nSANCTIONS\n\nWashington announced sanctions on Monday to punish Turkey, but Trump\u2019s critics said the steps, mainly a steel tariffs hike and a pause in trade talks, were too feeble to have an impact.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said sanctions included the entire ministries of energy and defence and could be broadened to others. Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives also plan to introduce sanctions legislation.\n\nTrump dispatched some of his top aides, including Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey for emergency talks to try to persuade Ankara to halt its assault. Trump said he thought Pence and Erdogan would have a \u201csuccessful meeting\u201d with Erdogan, saying if they did not, U.S. sanctions and tariffs \u201cwill be devastating to Turkey\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nErdogan\u2019s spokesman said Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry was preparing retaliation for U.S. sanctions.\n\nA White House meeting between Trump, Republican and Democratic lawmakers on U.S. policy in Syria was cut short. Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, said Trump was upset by a 354-60 House vote condemning his Syria withdrawal. Republicans said Pelosi \u201cstormed out.\u201d\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, in Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown. Sad to say,\u201d Pelosi, whose fellow Democrats are investigating whether to impeach Trump because of his actions towards Ukraine, said upon leaving.\n\nTrump shot back via Twitter on Wednesday night, posting - \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d with a photo of Pelosi standing up and pointing at him during the meeting.\n\nDozens of Republicans joined the majority Democrats in the House vote. The split underscored deep unhappiness in Congress over Trump\u2019s action, which many lawmakers view as abandoning Kurdish fighters who had been loyally fighting alongside Americans to defeat Islamic State.\n\nTrump has denied giving a green light to Turkey to attack the Syrian Kurds.\n\nErdogan has insisted there will be no ceasefire, and said he might call off a visit to the United States in November because of the \u201cvery big disrespect\u201d shown by U.S. politicians.\n\nHe also denounced Washington for taking the \u201cunlawful, ugly step\u201d of imposing criminal charges against a Turkish state bank Halkbank over allegations it broke sanctions on Iran. Washington says the case is unrelated to politics. Halkbank denies wrongdoing.\n\nTurkey\u2019s assault has spawned a humanitarian crisis, with 160,000 civilians taking flight, a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters abandoned in Kurdish jails, and a political maelstrom at home for Trump.\n\nSenior Republicans voiced dismay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that we are where we are,\u201d the characteristically understated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, telling reporters he hoped Pence and Pompeo \u201ccan somehow repair the damage\u201d during their trip to Ankara.\n\nSyrian army forces, backed by Washington\u2019s adversaries Russia and Iran, have exploited the power vacuum left by U.S. troops to advance.\n\nTurkey\u2019s cross-border offensive and the U.S. pullout have brought the two biggest militaries in NATO close to confrontation on the battlefield. The United States has complained about Turkish artillery fire near its troops.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nThe Syrian Observatory said Russian troops had crossed the Euphrates River to advance to Kobani\u2019s outskirts.\n\nLebanon\u2019s al-Mayadeen TV reported that Russian-backed Syrian forces had also set up outposts in Raqqa, the one-time capital of Islamic State\u2019s caliphate, which the Kurds captured in 2017 at the peak of their campaign with U.S. support.\n\nTrump did not object to an agreement cut between Kurdish-led forces and the Syrian government to protect Syria from a Turkish offensive, said Commander Mazloum Kobani of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), of which the Kurdish YPG is the main fighting element.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he did not mind Russia helping Syria in a conflict with NATO ally Turkey and rejected criticism of his withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria that exposed Kurdish allies, calling it \"strategically brilliant.\"", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441615767&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F18C", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
