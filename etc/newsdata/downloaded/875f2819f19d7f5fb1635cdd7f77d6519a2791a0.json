She also earned a win for writing the series.\n\nHarry Bradbeer described Ms. Waller-Bridge as a \u201cglorious grenade\u201d while accepting the award for directing a comedy series.\n\n\u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d star Alex Borstein, who plays the manager of the stand-up comedian at the center of the show, took home the supporting actress award for the second year in a row. Tony Shaloub won best supporting actor, his fourth Emmy, for his role as the high-strung father.\n\nLast year \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d set in the New York comedy scene of the 1950s and \u201960s, took home the award for outstanding comedy series.\n\nOperating on Fox without a host this year, the awards show opened with an appearance by Homer Simpson and transitioned into a moment of self-congratulation, with Bryan Cranston intoning: \u201cTelevision has never been bigger. Television has never mattered more. And television has never been this damn good.\u201d\n\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was on track to break a record the dragon-fueled fantasy show had previously set, in 2015, for the most single-year awards for a series. \u201cVeep\u201d was looking for its fourth win for outstanding comedy series, having won for its last three seasons.\n\nComparing the annual Emmy haul by HBO and Netflix is at least one way to keep score of the competition between TV\u2019s old and new guard. HBO went into this year\u2019s Emmys leading all networks with 137 total nominations, while Netflix went into voting with 118 nominations. The two outlets tied for total wins in 2018.\n\nWith a full-tilt campaign strategy, Netflix had nominations across categories, but the streamer was forced to observe in recent years as direct rivals became the first streamers to win best drama series (Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d) and best comedy series (Amazon\u2019s \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d).\n\nWrite to John Jurgensen at john.jurgensen@wsj.com", "description": "Comedies \u2018Fleabag\u2019 and \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 gain awards as show opens", "authors": ["John Jurgensen", "John.Jurgensen Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109729/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
