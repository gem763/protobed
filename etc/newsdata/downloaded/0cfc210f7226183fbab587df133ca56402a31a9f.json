I think the use of the assistant referee on the sidelines has worked well. So, certainly, we're pleased,\" he added.\n\nOrganisers also unveiled their list of officials for the knock-out stages.\n\nFrance's Jerome Garces will take charge of England v Australia, his second Rugby World Cup quarter-final. Experienced Welshman Nigel Owens will referee New Zealand's clash against Ireland in Tokyo Stadium on the same day.\n\nJaco Peyper from South Africa will officiate the Wales v France match - his first World Cup quarter-final - while English ref Wayne Barnes takes charge of the Japan v South Africa match in Tokyo.\n\n\"They are the best of the best and have played their full part in what will be remembered as an incredible pool stage,\" Beaumont said in a statement.\n\nMatch officials for the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals:\n\nEngland v Australia\n\nSaturday, 09:15 (SA time)\n\nOita Stadium\n\nReferee: Jerome Garces (France)\n\nAssistant referee: Romain Poite (France)\n\nAssistant referee: Mathieu Raynal (France)\n\nTMO: Ben Skeen (New Zealand)\n\n\n\nNew Zealand v Ireland\n\nSaturday, 12:15 (SA time)\n\nTokyo Stadium\n\nReferee: Nigel Owens (Wales)\n\nAssistant referee: Pascal Gauzere (France)\n\nAssistant referee: Angus Gardner (Australia)\n\nTMO: Graham Hughes (England)\n\n\n\nWales v France\n\nSunday, 09:15 (SA time)\n\nOita Stadium\n\nReferee: Jaco Peyper (South Africa)\n\nAssistant referee: Nic Berry (Australia)\n\nAssistant referee: Paul Williams (New Zealand)\n\nTMO: Marius Jonker (South Africa)\n\n\n\nJapan v South Africa\n\nSunday, 12:15 (SA time)\n\nTokyo Stadium\n\nReferee: Wayne Barnes (England)\n\nAssistant referee: Ben O\u2019Keeffe (New Zealand)\n\nAssistant referee: Luke Pearce (England)\n\nTMO: Rowan Kitt (England)", "description": "World Rugby chief Bill Beaumont says the standard of refereeing at the World Cup has improved after organisers took the rare step of admonishing officials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7392/d67120b3a2aa4ea6b462ba8fa60ea550.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
