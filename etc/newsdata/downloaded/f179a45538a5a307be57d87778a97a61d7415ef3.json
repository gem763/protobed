The whole family was glued to it and it inspired a lot of people,\u201d Veainu said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was good enough at the time to become an international, and even in 2015 I didn\u2019t really have anything contract-wise before Tonga threw me a lifeline.\u201d\n\nTonga won that match 19-14 in one of the competition\u2019s biggest upsets. The setback did the French a lot of good, though. From the humiliation of being torn apart by their unhappy media they went to reach the final and only just lost, 8-7 to the All Blacks in a nerve-shredder at Eden Park.\n\nHaving cheered the Tongans on television on that day eight years ago, TV can have a crack at the French for real in Sunday\u2019s Pool C encounter and he\u2019ll be buoyed by the two tries he scored in the 28-12 loss to Argentina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a massive challenge. Like Argentina. I think (France) will be trying to move the ball around,\u201d said Veainu, who has finally shaken off a persistent foot injury sustained playing for Leicester Tigers.\n\nTonga lost its tournament opener to England 35-3, but it wasn\u2019t entirely lopsided and the manner in which they rallied back from 28-0 down against Argentina was encouraging. Keen to keep that momentum going, head coach Toutai Kefu has made only two lineup changes for the match at Kumamoto Stadium.\n\nTight-head prop Ma\u2019afu Fia replaces Ben Tameifuna and Cooper Vuna, who played two test matches for Australia in 2012, comes in for Viliami Lolohea on the right wing.\n\nAdd that to the fact France had only a four-day turnaround after beating the United States and there is cautious optimism in Tonga\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough one for them and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to work out how best to deal with that. But they are Tier 1, we will find out if they can handle it,\u201d assistant Tonga coach Pita Alatini said. \u201cWith England to come in their last match, France are going to want a really good performance against us. We know they are going to target us, especially thinking back to 2011.\u201d\n\nFrance can maintain its unblemished record in always reaching the Rugby World Cup knockout round with a win.\n\nAlthough coach Jacques Brunel brushed away questions about the England game by saying \u201cI\u2019m only thinking about Tonga.\u201d Yet the fact he made 11 changes _ having made 12 after the 23-21 win against Argentina _ suggests he\u2019s keeping his players fresh to face the English on Oct. 12.\n\nThe balance of that match could well be decided in the scrum between two mighty packs.\n\nHooker Guilhem Guirado, the regular captain, is again not in the starting XV so the armband goes to prop Jefferson Poirot. He came off the bench to score the fifth try against the U.S. Eagles. Scrumhalf Baptiste Serin, who came on to get the fourth, is also picked alongside flyhalf Romain Ntamack.\n\nIt is France\u2019s third different halves combination at this tournament.\n\nThree different captains, too: Guirado against Argentina, No. 8 Louis Picamoles in the 33-9 win against the Eagles, and now Poirot.\n\nNtamack regains his place at flyhalf after ceding it to Camille Lopez, who set up France\u2019s two first-half tries against the Eagles with kicks over the top to each winger.\n\nWednesday\u2019s win showed how inconsistent France still is, but it also showed they have some big-impact players on the bench. Guirado, who came on at halftime with France struggling against a gritty U.S. team, is on the bench along with Lopez.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. did really well for a lot of the game, but we know what the French are like,\u201d Alatini said. \u201cThey scored a couple of tries of pure magic early and then at the end they showed what they could do with the caliber of players they brought on.\u201d\n\nLineups:\n\nFrance: Maxime Medard, Damian Penaud, Virimi Vakatawa, Sofiane Guitoune, Alivereti Raka, Romain Ntamack, Baptiste Serin; Gregorie Alldritt, Charles Ollivon, Wenceslas Lauret, Sebastien Vahaamahina, Paul Gabrillagues, Rabah Slimani, Camille Chat, Jefferson Poirot (captain). Reserves: Guilhem Guirado, Cyril Baille, Emerick Setiano, Bernard Le Roux, Yacouba Camara, Antoine Dupont, Camille Lopez, Pierre-Louis Barassi.\n\nTonga: Telusa Veainu, Cooper Vuna, Malietoa Hingano, Siale Piutau (captain), David Halaifonua, James Faiva, Sonatane Takulua; Maama Vaipulu, Zane Kapeli, Sione Kalamafoni, Leva Fifita, Sam Lousi, Ma\u2019afu Fia, Paula Ngauamo, Siegfried Fisiihoi. Reserves: Sosefo Sakalia, Vunipola Fifita, Siua Halanukonuka, Sitiveni Mafi, Nasi Manu, Leon Fukofuka, Latiume Fosita, Atieli Pakalani.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Telusa Veainu was far away when he watched Tonga\u2019s Rugby World Cup upset win over France in 2011, even though he was in New Zealand.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/japan_rugby_wcup_france_usa_66966_c0-190-2817-1832_s1770x1032.jpg?8f033981b7d80241d271da6772d6213daa3c39de", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
