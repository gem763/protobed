As many as 96% of teachers, children and parents don't associate the name Mia with being clever. Ouch.\n\nNaughtiest boys\n\nJack Harry Charlie Oliver George\n\nNaughtiest girls\n\nMia Ella Isabella Amelia Sophia\n\nWhen it comes to the best behaved children, Isla has been revealed as the top name in the study commissioned by My Nametags .\n\nFor boys, Arthur takes top spot, with just 4% of those surveyed expecting Arthurs to misbehave and the name being associated with being quiet and shy, as is the name Noah.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nFor girls, Grace is considered to be the shyest in class, with teachers, parents and children agreeing the name tends to belong to the most introverted kids.\n\nIn contrast, the names Charlie and Olivia are assumed to be the most confident.\n\nBest behaved boys\n\nArthur Noah Oscar Muhammad Leo\n\nBest behaved girls\n\nIsla Ava Grace Olivia Emily\n\nThe survey also found children named George are considered by both adults and their peers to be the most intelligent in class, and they also associate it with kindness.\n\n(Image: My Nametags)\n\nTeachers say Isabella tops the list when it comes to being smart, but children think very differently with one in 10 assuming girls with the name will be spoilt.\n\nFor boys, little ones expect Harrys to be the most spoilt in the playground.\n\nManaging director at My Nametags, Lars B. Andersen, said: \u201cWe know that there are strong stereotypes attached to names and that someone\u2019s first name can really paint a picture of what they are like.\n\n\"It was interesting to discover that these stereotypes are formed from a young age, with children and adults quick to make judgements about children based on their first name alone.\n\n\"These beliefs can make the difficult task of naming a child even more challenging, but we hope that our research will help give expectant parents an insight into society\u2019s opinions of the most popular boys and girls names in the UK right now.\"\n\nWhich list does your child's name appear on?", "description": "The children with the naughtiest names have been revealed - and those likely to be the best behaved", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty", "My Nametags"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article7979603.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_child-scribbling.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
