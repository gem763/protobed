This is no doubt needed to bring about a change in behaviour,\" Lyes said.\n\n\"You could liken the current situation with engine idling to that of taking your own carrier bags to the supermarket: everyone knew it was the right thing to do, but few of us did it until a compulsory charge was introduced.\"\n\nIn June, the Department for Transport announced it intends to launch a public consultation looking at increasing fines for idling drivers.\n\nCouncils responded by saying they had chosen to educate where possible, rather than punish.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nLocal Government Association transport spokesman David Renard said: \"Councils have prioritised changing behaviour by educating motorists, which is often more effective than issuing fines.\n\n\"As part of their review of air quality legislation, the Government should look again at whether these powers are working how they intended and whether they could be made simpler to use while still being fair to the motorist.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cAlthough fines to drivers who leave their engines idling are issued as a last resort, the legislation to enable this is hard to enforce in practice.\"\n\nHe said councils were also looking at other measures to reduce air pollution, including working with schools to set up car free streets to prevent engine idling, encouraging the use of electric vehicles with recharging points, promoting cycling, managing air pollution monitoring networks and introducing clean air zones.", "description": "Leaving the motor running when parked carries a small fine, but there's growing support for increasing it as well making sure councils take action more often", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty Images", "Universal Images Group Via Getty", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4794645.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/A-traffic-warden-issues-a-parking-ticket.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
