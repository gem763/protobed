Every day between now and when the season opens Oct. 22 we will have at least one story focused on the upcoming season and the biggest questions heading into it. In addition, there will be podcasts, video and more. Come back every day and get ready for a wide-open NBA season.\n\nNBA teams had historically high roster churn this summer. With so many newcomers around the league, there are fewer than usual obvious in-season trade candidates entering the year. But a few still stand out:\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNene (Rockets)\n\nThe NBA nixed the Rockets\u2019 plan to have Nene as a $10 million trade chip. But that might have made it even more likely they trade him.\n\nThe upside Nene\u2019s contract provided would\u2019ve been to add salary, which would\u2019ve almost certainly pushed Houston into the luxury tax. Obviously, that was at least a consideration. Otherwise, why sign Nene to that deal? But it\u2019s unclear just how good of a return Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta \u2013 notorious for dodging the tax \u2013 would\u2019ve required to greenlight a trade.\n\nFertitta won\u2019t have to worry about that now. With the NBA\u2019s ruling, Nene counts $2,564,753 against the cap. His salary would nearly double if he plays 10 games, which therefore almost certainly won\u2019t happen. He has become too-expensive dead weight on a team flirting with the luxury-tax line.\n\nThe Rockets attaching a sweetener to dump Nene is most likely. He could also be dealt as an expiring contract to facilitate something else. But one way or another, expect Houston to trade Nene before the luxury tax is assessed the final day of the regular season \u2013 which of course means trading Nene before the trade deadline.\n\nSeveral other deep reserves (Rockets)\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the five minimum-salary players who began last year with Houston and didn\u2019t hold an implicit no-trade clause, three got traded during the season.\n\nThe Rockets have figured they can move players on full-season minimum salaries and replace them with players on the pro-rated minimum. It\u2019s a clever way to meet the roster minimum all season and still get more breathing room under the luxury tax.\n\nSo, Tyson Chandler, Thabo Sefolosha, Ryan Anderson, Gary Clark and Isaiah Hartenstein all look like prime candidates to get traded this year. If any of Ben McLemore, Anthony Bennett, Jaron Blossomgame, Michael Frazier, Shamorie Ponds or Chris Clemons make the regular-season roster, add them to the list.\n\nJae Crowder (Grizzlies)\n\nAndre Iguodala isn\u2019t Memphis\u2019 only veteran forward on an expiring contract who\u2019d help a winner more than this rebuilding outfit. Crowder also fits the bill, and he\u2019s more likely to get traded for a couple reasons:\n\n1. Crower\u2019s salary ($7,815,533) is far lower than Iguodala\u2019s ($17,185,185). Interested teams will have a more difficult time matching salary for Iguodala. Acquiring Crowder is much more manageable.\n\n2. Iguodala is a 15-year pro with supporters all around the league, First Vice President of the players\u2019 union and former NBA Finals MVP. Crowder lacks those credentials. Iguodala has far more cache to command a buyout.\n\nIguodala is more likely to change teams this season, but it could be by trade or buyout. Crowder is more likely to change teams via trade.\n\nJosh Jackson (Grizzlies)\n\nIguodala isn\u2019t even the second-most-likely Grizzly to be traded. That\u2019s Jackson, who\u2019s so far from Memphis\u2019 plans, he didn\u2019t even report to training camp.\n\nWith his fourth-year option sure to be declined, Jackson will become a $7,059,480 expiring contract. That makes him useful in so many possible trade constructions. He could allow Memphis to acquire an undesirable long-term contract plus an asset. He could grease the wheels of a larger trade. Maybe another team even wants to take a flier on the 2017 No. 4 pick.\n\nBetween all the possibilities, it seems like a decent bet one comes to fruition.\n\nDanilo Gallinari (Thunder)\n\nChris Paul has generated all the headlines, but in its star trades, Oklahoma City acquired two quality veterans to match salary. Gallinari, 31, is younger and maybe even better at this stage. His contract (one year, $22,615,559 remaining) is definitely more favorable than Paul\u2019s (three years, $124,076,442 remaining)\n\nPlenty of contending teams could use another talented forward like Gallinari \u2013 if he\u2019s healthy. That\u2019s the big catch. Gallinari thrived with the Clippers last year, but that was his healthiest season in years.\n\nPaul, Dennis Schroder (two years, $31 million remaining) and Steven Adams (two years, $53,370,785 remaining) are also candidates to get moved. But there will probably be more urgency from the Thunder to get assets for Gallinari and more of a market for him.\n\nA couple notes on prominent players not yet mentioned:\n\nI predicted Bradley Beal will tire of the Wizards\u2019 losing and leave Washington. It doesn\u2019t have to happen this season. Though I wouldn\u2019t rule out a trade before the deadline, Beal will like ride out the year in hopes of making an All-NBA team and gaining super-max eligibility. That might be his best ticket to staying, though paying Beal and John Wall the super-max would sure limit the Wizards.\n\nThe Warriors insist they didn\u2019t acquire D'Angelo Russell just to trade him. I believe them. I also believe he\u2019s a difficult fit with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, especially defensively. A Russell trade remains very much on the table. But if Golden State plans to give it an honest shot with Russell \u2013 and with Thompson sidelined most of the season \u2013 a Russell trade won\u2019t necessarily happen before the deadline.", "description": "With so many newcomers around the league, there are fewer than usual obvious in-season trade candidates entering the year.", "authors": ["Dan Feldman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/41wBxsyREVbXBfDltmYBjA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mbxrpcSw4LXwOQGSzykQoQ--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/635cdc71d2ccab50704d40c507564672", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
