(Daria Addabbo)\n\n\n\nFreehold, N.J., April 2018. (Daria Addabbo)\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to let your mind wander to iconic American imagery when you listen to the lyrics of Bruce Springsteen. Front porches on a hot summer day; a country fair on Main Street; the wind in your hair on a long road \u2014 Springsteen\u2019s songs paint a vivid picture of the country and its evolution.\n\nBut for Italian photographer Daria Addabbo, the songs are more than just images of screen doors and streetlights; she believes they are her American compass.\n\nAddabbo, who is based in Rome, oriented herself in this landscape last year for her project \u201cThis Hard Land,\u201d which will be published by Jaca Book next month. It was wholly inspired by Springsteen, who turned 70 on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe aim was to picture his songs and the contemporary United States through them: the working-class condition, the middle-class crisis, the American Dream, broken but still alive,\u201d Addabbo told In Sight. \u201cThe lyrics are a true manifesto of the American suburbs, with its characters ready to burn and run away with their dreams.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Italy, surrounded by music, Addabbo took inspiration in the medium\u2019s ability to provide vivid images without imposing them.\n\n\u201cListening to Springsteen was like looking at hundreds of movies and photo books,\u201d she said.\n\nAddabbo believes Springsteen shares a similar relationship with the stories in his lyrics as a photojournalist does to the stories they photograph.\n\n\u201cDespite not using the first person, there\u2019s always his personality in the watermark,\u201d she said. Songs, like the best images, capture both the reality of a circumstance, along with the emotions and atmosphere that surround it.\n\nIn the towns where Springsteen wrote his first lyrics 40 years ago, Addabbo found that while the stories and expectations have changed, the American Dream and its contradictions remain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an Italian dream,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s only the Italian delusion, where you feel like you\u2019re moving, but you\u2019re actually stuck in space and time.\u201d\n\nBecoming a photographer and completing \u201cThis Hard Land\u201d has become Addabbo\u2019s own version of the American Dream.\n\n\u201cDreaming,\u201d she said, \u201cgave me the energy to go into photography.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe house where Springsteen grew up in Freehold, N.J.
