But a lot happened in the roughly four decades it took to get there. And, according to the American activist David Barr, there's much that needs to be done to ensure the gains are not reversed.\n\nBarr has seen almost everything in his 35 years of fighting the epidemic, from the early gatherings in the 1980s of the pioneering activist group ACT UP to the roll-out of treatments that saved millions of lives, including his own.\n\nLooking back at his life's work, and the seminal efforts in the United States that helped launch a global movement, Barr broke down the six stages of the battle against HIV/AIDS.\n\nFear\n\nTo be gay in the 1980s was to be scared. There was a disease infecting your friends, and someday it might come for you, too \u2014 if it hadn't already.\n\nLawyers around the U.S. were calling the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, where Barr was working, asking what they could do for clients who had been kicked out of doctor's offices, thrown out of apartments, or fired.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much they could do. By 1985, the U.S. government had just licensed an antibody test that screened for HIV, the precursor to AIDS, which had already claimed thousands of lives in the U.S.\n\nLambda was advising the gay community not to take the test because there was nothing protecting people should they test positive. Texas had tried, after all, to pass a law forcing those who tested positive to be quarantined.\n\nAnd what were you supposed to do if you tested positive anyway? That just meant you were afflicted by an illness for which there was no cure.\n\n\u201cAnd in the midst of all of it, our government wasn't responding at all,\u201d Barr said.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople were sick and dying all around us, constantly,\u201d \u2014 American activist David Barr\n\nSo the gay community developed their own legal responses, introduced education about how to keep from catching the disease, and put in place social work services. And they began to fight back.\n\nFight\n\nIn New York City in the late 1980s, Monday nights at the newly established AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) meetings were the place to be. By the summer of 1987, hundreds of gay people made their way to take part.\n\n\u201cPeople were sick and dying all around us, constantly,\u201d Barr said. \"It felt like we were in a war zone.\u201d\n\nIn a politically charged time, ACT UP was the angry activist group. Their first action was to protest the high price for the antiretroviral azidothymidine (AZT), the only treatment on the market for people living with HIV.\n\nIn October 1988, ACT UP took the fight to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in suburban Maryland, donning lab coats with their hands painted red with fake blood, demanding a government response. They wanted more studies on HIV/AIDS, and they wanted quicker access to possible treatments.\n\n\"That was really the demonstration where the national AIDS movement was born,\" Barr said.\n\nDrugs\n\nAs the camaraderie of the early years began to fray, Barr and other members of ACT UP broke off in 1991 to form their own group, Treatment Action Group (TAG), to begin a new phase of activism. Rather than fight the power, they'd try to harness it. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to take over the FDA,\" Barr explained. \"I needed to get into the room with FDA.\u201d\n\nIn 1993, AIDS claimed around 40,000 lives in the U.S. alone.\n\nThat year, Barr and four other members of TAG protested a conference in Berlin, where a doctor planned to say that taking AZT and two other analogs, ddI or ddC, was effective for a particular group of people. Barr and his fellow activists stormed in to tell the crowd that her results were skewed, and the drugs were actually not effective at all. The group of five marched out to applause and the feeling of triumph.\n\n\u201cWe had made our point,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pills were difficult to take. Patients couldn't miss a dose. The side effects could be harsh. But they were working.\n\nBut later, as they sat in a park, the reality of what that meant hit them: They were left without a cure. \u201cWe were the ones who were going to suffer from this,\" he explained.\n\nTurning point\n\nThe mid-1990s were a time of guarded optimism. Patients who had signed up for clinical trials and an expanded access program were taking what was informally known as the AIDS cocktail, and it seemed to be working: \u201cPeople getting up from their deathbeds \u2014 literally,\u201d Barr said.\n\nThe pills were difficult to take. Patients couldn't miss a dose. The side effects could be harsh. But they were working. By 1996, antiretrovirals were available on the market for anyone with the virus \u2014 not just those in the expanded trials. The FDA, having recognized the urgency, was flagging new treatments for approval, with less data than was needed for any other group of drugs before it. That was the first year that death rates began to decline.\n\n\u201cThere was certainly some elation,\u201d Barr said. \u201cBut there was also this odd guilt, because why am I alive, and my friends aren't? How did I get lucky, and they didn\u2019t? There was no rhyme or reason to any of it.\u201d\n\nGlobal battle\n\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS went worldwide in the 2000s.\n\nThe momentum began at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa in 2000, when activists in the country took their national fight to the global stage.\n\nThe Global Fund and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the two main revenue streams for HIV/AIDS funding, were put in place. The World Health Organization set a goal of getting 3 million people into treatment by 2005 \u2014 \u201ca very ambitious target at the time.\u201d\n\nHIV/AIDS activists teamed up around the world. Some faced \u201cmuch greater challenges\u201d than in New York, and their collaborative work built momentum and help rake in money.\n\nFear subsides, a whole new generation is growing up now who has not learned the lessons from the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"We were making the right argument at the right time,\" Barr said.\n\nFragile success\n\nBarr says the fight has only gotten more difficult. Funding for HIV/AIDS has remained relatively flat. A 2019 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation and UNAIDS found that donor governments' spending hasn't changed much in the last year. Donors are also less inclined to give money for HIV-specific work.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of people living with HIV continues to rise. \u201cEvery year you have a flat budget it\u2019s like a cut,\u201d Barr said.\n\nU.N. member states signed up to 90-90-90 targets in 2014, pledging to ensure that by 2020, 90 percent of people with HIV will know their status, 90 percent of those diagnosed will be on antiretroviral therapies, and 90 percent of those receiving therapy will have succeeded in repressing the virus. But they have not come up with the money to make that happen.\n\nBarr objects to how UNAIDS and PEPFAR frame their messaging. They claim \"we\u2019ll meet the targets, and we\u2019ll end AIDS,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not true.\" Those starting treatment now will have to maintain it for decades. \u201cThose bills are going to keep coming in,\u201d he said.\n\nThen there's sex and drugs \u2014 as the fear subsides, a whole new generation is growing up now who has not learned the lessons from the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"The success we have made is remarkable,\" Barr said, \"but it's incredibly fragile.\"\n\n\u201cIf the response is not sustained and maintained, we're going to lose the tools we've miraculously been able to develop [over the decades],\" Barr warned. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re back to 1986.\u201d\n\nThis article is produced with full editorial independence by POLITICO reporters and editors.
