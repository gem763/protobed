It's leading some quite large organisations to ask if we can help.'\n\nThe publication also spoke to one British company that employs robots and requires humans to carry fellow robot colleagues out of the building on their shoulder when the fire alarm sounds.\n\nUK areas most 'vulnerable' to the rise of robots were analysed by Oxford Economics, who found that East Yorkshire, Northern Lincolnshire, Shropshire, Stafordshire, Cumbria, West Wales and the Valleys are most likely to see the rise of the machines.\n\nThe report stated: 'These regions are relatively dependent on manufacturing for employment, and have a relatively high incidence of low-skilled workers.'\n\nWorld wide 1.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost to robots who can do the same job quicker or for more cost effectively, around 400,000 of those in Europe, a report by Oxford Economics states.\n\nThe report also predicted 20 million people will have been replaced by the machines in the work place by 2030.\n\nDespite these figures researchers at De Montfort University in Leicester found that British businesses were struggling to find robot alternatives 'cost effective' due to the cost incurred when implementing them smoothly to the business and co-workers.", "description": "The study by De Montfort University in Leicester which looked into the use of robotics in healthcare concluded that UK workers are particularly apposed to the introduction of robots into the work place.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/29/09/19066974-0-image-a-4_1569744929283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
