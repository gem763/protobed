The two-year gilt yield rose to its highest level since Sept. 16 at 0.575%, up 7.5 basis points on the day.\n\nThe move rippled into the broader European bond market with 10-year German government bond yields up 4 basis points to -0.41%, their highest in two and a half months.\n\n\"The more uncertainty you remove the better for investors. If the prime minister and the EU were now to agree a deal, then the market would take that positively,\" said Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas.\n\nBritain must reach a Brexit deal with the bloc by the end of Tuesday for it to be approved at a leaders' summit this week, the bloc's officials and diplomats said. Otherwise, Britain's scheduled departure date of Oct. 31 could be delayed.\n\nOfficials said it was still possible to reach a deal over customs arrangements on the island of Ireland by the Tuesday deadline, and if not, an extra summit could be called before the end of the month.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by the London Markets Team; Editing by Mike Doland and David Clarke)", "description": "Sterling surged on Tuesday to its highest level against the dollar and the euro since May while British stocks and government bond yields also rose after Bloomberg said British and EU negotiators were closing in on a draft Brexit deal.
