That evening, diGenova went off on the judge while reacting to his analysis.\n\n\u201cI think Judge Napolitano is a fool. And what he said today is foolish,\u201d diGenova exclaimed. \u201cNo, it is not a crime. Let me underscore emphatically that nothing that the president said on that call or what we think he said on that call constitutes a crime and even if he had said you\u2019re not gonna get the money, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime.\u201d\n\nAfter hosting Napolitano to discuss the White House\u2019s release of the memo describing Trump\u2019s call, Smith took a moment to address diGenova\u2019s comments from the night prior. And he did not hold back.\n\n\u201cLast night on this network during prime time opinion programming, a partisan guest who supports President Trump was asked about Judge Napolitano\u2019s legal assessment and when he was asked, he said unchallenged \u2018Judge Napolitano is a fool,\u2019\u201d Smith stated, taking a not-so-veiled shot at Carlson in the process.\n\n\u201cAttacking our colleague, who is here to offer legal assessments, on our air in our work home is repugnant,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "After hosting Napolitano to discuss the White House\u2019s release of memo that described Trump\u2019s call, Smith addressed diGenova\u2019s comments.
