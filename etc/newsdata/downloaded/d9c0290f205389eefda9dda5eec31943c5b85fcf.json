Hedge fund activist Dan Loeb of Third Point joined in, and they ultimately prevailed in convincing eBay to sell PayPal in a maelstrom that eventually led to the exit of Chief Executive John Donahoe. NOW, +0.73%\n\nDonahoe\u2019s replacement was Devin Wenig, who just faced the same gauntlet and took his leave from the e-commerce company on Wednesday. This time, Elliott Management and Starboard Financial are pressuring eBay to spin off StubHub and Classifieds, a move that Wenig \u2014 like predecessor Donoahoe when Icahn first came after PayPal \u2014 disagreed with, even as the activist\u2019s new representatives on the board fought for the move.\n\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, it has become clear I was not on the same page as my new board,\u201d Wenig wrote in a tweet thread Wednesday indicating that his departure will be paving the way for the sales of its two non-core business units.\n\nIn the past few weeks it became clear that I was not on the same page as my new Board. Whenever that happens, its best for everyone to turn that page over. It has been an incredible privilege to lead one of the worlds great businesses for the past 8 years. \u2014 Devin Wenig (@devinwenig) September 25, 2019\n\nWhile up till now, the stories seem similar, there is one big difference: PayPal was considered the crown jewel of eBay by many investors at the time, with its faster growth rate and high profit margins. But can the same be said for the two eBay businesses that the current group of shareholder activists are salivating over?\n\nIn the most recent second quarter, both businesses delivered single digit revenue growth: StubHub had revenue of $264 million, up 7% in the quarter, while Classifieds had revenue of $271 million, up 5%, while eBay\u2019s core marketplace revenue of $2.2 billion was pretty much flat, up 1%.\n\nElliott Management argued in its letter in January to eBay\u2019s board that these two assets are worth more alone than they are as part of eBay. But their growth pales in comparison to the double-digit revenue growth rates PayPal was exhibiting at the time of the spin-off. Revenue growth has slowed since then, but PayPal is still expected to grow full year revenue about 15% in 2019, per consensus estimates on FactSet.\n\nThere are reasons to be frustrated with Wenig, whose work on eBay\u2019s core marketplace has been going on with slow results for at least three years. The biggest effort, data restructuring aimed at getting eBay listings included in broader search engines like Google, has frustrated users and not made a huge dent in improving revenue growth.\n\nWenig might be right, though, that selling off two businesses will not help the company much beyond a short-term infusion of cash that likely won\u2019t be enough to truly matter. And Wenig should land on his feet \u2014 Donahoe certainly did, taking over the CEO helm at booming software company ServiceNow Inc. NOW, +0.73% , as did eBay\u2019s CFO at the time of the last activist-sparked selloff, current Intel Corp. INTC, +2.41% CEO Bob Swan.\n\nFor eBay, it\u2019s highly unlikely that spinning out smaller assets with slower growth will work out as well for investors as the PayPal move did. Instead, the focus \u2014 as it was for Wenig \u2014 should be on making eBay\u2019s core marketplace better at what it does well: being the world\u2019s largest garage and estate sale.\n\nAt this point, eBay is what it is, a unique marketplace that needs a lot of improvements. Investors and executives need to focus on how to improve it, not on acting like one of its sellers and continuously hawking goods that it bought a few years ago.", "description": "EBay Inc. has been here and done this with a CEO resigning amid an activist fight to spin off assets, but the sequel may not have the same payoff this time.", "authors": ["Therese Poletti"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS078_ebay_w_ZG_20190925184401.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
