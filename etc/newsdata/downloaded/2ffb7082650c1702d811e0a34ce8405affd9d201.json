The alleged offender was not identified.\n\nIn documenting the church\u2019s failure to protect its youth from predators, the report cited the example of one now-deceased Denver-area priest, George Weibel, who investigators concluded had molested at least two girls under the guise of teaching them to swim or ice skate.\n\nOne victim reported the abuse to another priest, who failed to notify church superiors because he was good friends with Weibel, according to the report commissioned by the state attorney general\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cHe did not report it to Denver Archdiocese authorities, and he did not even record her (victim) report until years later. As a result, the Denver Archdiocese did not take any action against Weibel,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report\u2019s release came eight months after the three dioceses agreed to open up their personnel files to Troyer\u2019s team of investigators and set up a compensation fund for victims.\n\nIn a statement following the release of the report, Denver Archbishop Samuel Aquila apologized to the victims, but said his words could not ease their suffering.\n\n\u201cI am sorry about this horrible history \u2014 but it is my promise to continue doing everything I can so it never happens again,\u201d Aquila said.\n\nThe U.S. Catholic Church has paid out more than $3 billion to settle such claims since clergy sexual abuse exploded as an international scandal in 2002, when the Boston Globe first reported on priests molesting children and church leaders covering it up, according to the website BishopAccountability.org, which tracks the issue.\n\nThe Colorado report said that of the 166 known victims, the \u201cvast majority\u201d were boys, and most were between the ages of 10 and 14.\n\nIn 2008, the Denver archdiocese paid out $5.5 million to settle 16 abuse claims, including those against one priest, since deceased, who victimized at least 63 children.\n\nIn a statement, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) urged Colorado lawmakers to pursue legislative action to help prevent abuse and ease statutes of limitations that have barred many victims from coming forward with claims of past abuse.", "description": "At least 166 children have been sexually abused at the hands of 43 Roman Catholic priests in Colorado since 1950, an investigative report disclosed on Wednesday, far exceeding the scope of the scandal previously documented in the state.", "authors": ["Keith Coffman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
