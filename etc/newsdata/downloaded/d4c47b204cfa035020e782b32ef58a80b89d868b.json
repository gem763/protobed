He uses them on special occasions at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del. One glass was recently repaired by a conservator. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nAmid all the frenzied decluttering, organizing and tidying going on these days, it\u2019s easy to overlook the special things worth keeping. They may be locked in a safe-deposit box, wrapped in tissue in a closet or entombed in a plastic container in a storage unit. They might be faded or torn, eaten by moths and the passage of time. Rescuing a family artifact takes thought and often money.\n\nBut the act of saving it and honoring it can be tremendously satisfying. Ingrid Fetell Lee, designer, author and founder of the blog the Aesthetics of Joy, believes in the power of ordinary things to create extraordinary happiness. \u201cI think when you keep fewer things, you value them more,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of having thousands of photos in boxes, you keep and frame the ones you really love.\u201d\n\nLee says that when objects are invested with experiences, they can prompt a memory of an event or sensation. \u201cKeeping those things closely around you matters, sort of like souvenirs from a vacation,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sensory experience embedded in that object.\u201d\n\n[Q&A: Textiles conservator Julia Brennan on preserving heirlooms]\n\nThere\u2019s an ever-expanding number of ways to preserve those memories. Shana Novak of the Heirloomist created a business of photographing them, blowing up the images and turning them into artwork. Novak, who is based in New York, has photographed a beloved Millennium Falcon model, a tattered handwritten recipe book and a grandfather\u2019s violin. \u201cThese treasures have the same love-from-the-gut feeling,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are all special in their own way.\u201d\n\nWe asked five families about the objects they could never part with, the heirlooms they\u2019ve cherished and preserved. Here are their stories.\n\n\n\nPatrick Gossett, right, and Howard Menaker at their home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where they live among a number of family treasures. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nPatrick Gossett grew up in Riverdale Park, Md., where some of his fondest childhood memories were made in the family dining room. When his mother pulled her eight jewel-toned wineglasses out of the china cabinet, he knew something good was about to happen.\n\n\u201cMy mother loved beautiful things, simple things,\u201d Gossett says. \u201cThese glasses were brought out for special occasions. They meant a lot to her, and they mean a lot to me.\u201d\n\nIn the 1930s before she was married, Gossett\u2019s mother, Elizabeth, took the streetcar downtown to her job as a secretary. The women she commuted with \u2014 Lib, Stell, Marie, Mable, Rhoda and Elaine \u2014 became her posse. The group regularly passed a fancy Connecticut Avenue shop where they often stopped and Elizabeth would admire a set of colorful handblown wineglasses.\n\nWhen she married in 1935, the women pooled their money and gave her the glasses as a wedding present. They became a symbol of festive times in the Gossett home at holidays or \u201cwhen the girls would come over for birthday dinners or showers,\u201d says Gossett, whose father died when he was 6. \u201cThey would have so much fun.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe vintage wineglasses are full of happy memories for Gossett. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nGossett inherited the glasses in 2000, when his mother died at age 88 and he and his two older brothers divided up her things.\n\n\u201cYou go back to those things in your life that bring back pleasant memories,\u201d says Gossett, 65, now retired from the hotel and event-planning business. He uses them in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he and husband Howard Menaker do most of their entertaining, as their Logan Circle condo is small.\n\n\u201cI know decluttering is the new emphasis these days,\u201d Gossett says. \u201cBut knowing how much my mother loved and used these makes our own occasions even more significant.\u201d\n\nThe glasses were all in good condition and had always been hand-washed. But last year, the stem of the green one snapped off.\n\n[What to do if a plate breaks or a crystal glass chips]\n\n\u201cFor a while, I just left it,\u201d Gossett says, but he decided it was important to keep the full set. He had dealt with conservation professionals as president of the Riversdale Historical Society, so he asked conservator Anne Kingery-Schwartz to fix the break.\n\nKingery-Schwartz cleaned and degreased the glass, aligned the break edges and applied epoxy to the break. A chip of the original glass was missing, so epoxy was used to fill in that area. She constructed a support to align the edges and hold them firmly in place. It took about eight weeks. \u201cYou can\u2019t even tell it has been repaired,\u201d Gossett says.\n\nThe set returned to Gossett and Menaker\u2019s Thanksgiving table. \u201cIn life, you hold on to the good memories. These were full of them,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on that kind of joy.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarcia Kepler Noor and twin daughters Alex Noor, left, and Zoe Noor now all wear jewelry made from a cocktail ring that had been in Kepler Noor\u2019s family for generations. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe diamond cocktail ring that Marcia Kepler Noor\u2019s mother gave her in the 1980s was gorgeous, but it seemed a bit glitzy for everyday wear. The cluster of diamonds on high prongs formed a flower, a design popular about 100 years ago. The ring was a family heirloom and had originally belonged to Kepler Noor\u2019s great-grandmother, handed down for generations.\n\nKepler Noor, 53, kept the ring hidden away most of the time. But after she gave birth to twin girls, Zoe and Alex Noor, in 2002, she says, she gained \u201ca different perspective on passing things down and saving memories.\u201d Kepler Noor\u2019s mother, Esther Kepler, had died before Zoe and Alex were born, but the family speaks of her often, has photos of her around the house and uses her recipes.\n\n\n\nThe rings that were designed for Alex and Zoe are similar but slightly different, as one is set in 14-karat gold and one in 14-karat white gold; one has a yellow sapphire and the other a blue one. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nZoe Noor remembers admiring the ring from time to time. \u201cWhen we were younger we loved looking at my mom\u2019s jewelry,\u201d she says. \u201cShe always talked about this ring, but she almost never wore it.\u201d\n\nAs the girls approached their 16th birthday last year, Kepler Noor and her husband, Enam Noor, owners of Insightin Health, a Baltimore health analytics firm, decided that repurposing the ring into a gift for each girl would be a wonderful way to honor the past and embrace the future.\n\nShe found Alexandria & Co. Workshop and Design Studio online. Owners Tim Shaheen and Meaghan Foran had taken over an established Alexandria silversmith and jewelry business and added a focus on custom designs. Kepler Noor, who lives in Eldersburg, Md., told Foran and Shaheen she didn\u2019t want anything showy. \u201cThe girls are into sports; they play soccer,\u201d she says. \u201cThey aren\u2019t into large rings.\u201d\n\nForan and Shaheen designed each twin\u2019s ring to be slightly different. Both got a new sapphire (yellow for Zoe and blue for Alex) and four small diamonds from their grandmother\u2019s ring. Zoe\u2019s is set in 14-karat gold, Alex\u2019s in 14-karat white gold. The center diamond was set into a circle necklace on a rose-gold chain for Kepler Noor and is flanked by two new small diamonds that represent her and her sister, Rachel.\n\nThe girls were presented with the rings at their 16th-birthday party at a restaurant in December. Their mom gave a speech about how proud she was of them. Even the server cried. \u201cI love the rings because we made them almost the same, but different, just like they are,\u201d Kepler Noor says.\n\nZoe and Alex were thrilled. \u201cI never owned anything with a story like this,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWhen I got the ring, I knew I would wear it all the time.\u201d\n\nSays Kepler Noor: \u201cThat ring was like a piece of my mom. But the great part is that now, we can all wear it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBryant Mitchell inherited a Davenport captain\u2019s desk that had been in his family for more than 100 years. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nBryant and Madeleine Mitchell keep their own family mementos in the desk. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe small mahogany captain\u2019s desk in Bryant and Madeleine Mitchell\u2019s Old Town Alexandria townhouse has lots of stories to tell.\n\nThe 1870 English antique has been in Bryant Mitchell\u2019s family for more than 100 years. He first remembers the piece, called a Davenport desk, at his grandfather\u2019s house in his hometown of Hampton, Va.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather Solomon Phillips was my best buddy. We were very close,\u201d says Mitchell, 72, who has a commercial real estate firm in Alexandria. \u201cThis desk means a lot to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe tiny drawer in the captain\u2019s desk used to hold rolls of nickels, which were handed out to Bryant Mitchell\u2019s mother and her siblings for lunch money. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nMitchell\u2019s mother told him stories of when her three older sisters would receive gentlemen callers in the living room. All of a sudden, their father would come down to the desk to \u201cpay bills.\u201d \u201cIf Grandpa saw they were staying too late, he would come into the living room and act like he was writing at this desk,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cThe guys would get the hint and wrap up their visit.\u201d\n\nNo one knows exactly when the tilt-front desk came into their family. The top lifts up, and there are individual slots for letters. It has unusual small drawers on the side that used to hold rolls of nickels, which were given out to Mitchell\u2019s mother, her sisters and her brother for lunch money. (\u201cYes, school lunches cost 5 cents back then,\u201d Mitchell says.) There are also stories that a family of mice had once lived in it and had chewed on a piece now missing from one of the tiny drawers.\n\nBryant and Madeleine inherited the desk in 2006 from his Aunt Agnes. She had insisted on giving it a bit of TLC before it passed to the next generation, so the inheritance included paying for it to be polished up and having loose parts reglued by Cavalier Antiques in Alexandria.\n\nThe desk was ready for its new home with the Mitchells and their daughter, Phillips. The family joked that \u201cBryant might do the same thing with this desk,\u201d says Madeleine, a gallery director at Doris Leslie Blau, recalling Solomon Phillips\u2019s \u201cbill paying.\u201d\n\nOf course he never did, and now Phillips, 28, lives in New York. The plan is that someday, she\u2019ll start a new chapter in the history of the desk.\n\n\n\nWorld War II maps displayed at the Shaw home of Nathan Canestaro once belonged to his grandfather. He discovered them in a box and had them conserved. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Nathan Canestaro was growing up, he didn\u2019t know much about his grandfather Herbert Todd\u2019s service in the Navy in World War II.\n\n\u201cHe never talked about the war,\u201d says Canestaro, 45. \u201cHe put that phase of his life behind him. His war memorabilia was hidden in a box in the basement. When I asked him about it near the end of his life, he started crying. It broke my heart.\u201d\n\nTodd, a master carpenter in Cortland, N.Y., died in 2010 at age 89. That\u2019s when Canestaro, a defense analyst for the federal government, started unraveling the story of Todd\u2019s service in the Pacific. He had been a tail gunner on an Avenger torpedo bomber on the USS Cowpens, a light aircraft carrier nicknamed the Mighty Moo, from 1944 to 1945.\n\n\u201cI wanted to find out more,\u201d says Canestaro, who lives in the District\u2019s Shaw neighborhood with his wife, Sarah, and two young sons. \u201cI\u2019m interested in military history, and I didn\u2019t want my grandfather\u2019s things to just be another box of stuff. If you don\u2019t pass these stories on, they get lost.\u201d\n\nThe box eventually made its way to Canestaro. Included in it were two uniforms, a flak helmet, service ribbons and photos. The most intriguing find: a plastic bag full of colorful fabric maps and documents folded in tiny squares.\n\nThis year, he restored four of the cloths. One was a rayon \u201cblood chit,\u201d which aircrews were routinely issued containing a message in a local language that asks for help if stranded and offers rewards. (The term \u201cblood chit\u201d means that it was meant to save a life \u2014 that the U.S. government promised to pay for the life of the bearer.) The others were survival maps, navigational aids for downed aviators: two double-sided rayon maps of Pacific Ocean currents and a large silk map of Mindanao, Philippines.\n\n\n\nNathan Canestaro in his home in Washington. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe maps, printed on rayon and silk, were carefully cleaned and preserved and framed so they would last for generations to come. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nCanestaro took the heavily creased and stained materials to conservator Julia Brennan of Washington\u2019s Caring for Textiles. Brennan gently cleaned the pieces and dried them on sheets of glass. Then the blood chit was mounted on an archival padded board; the maps were carefully stitched to silk organza borders for framing. The next step was taking them to Bill Butler of Archival Art Services in Alexandria. Butler put them in custom walnut frames using silk-wrapped mats and UV-filtering plexiglass. The two double-sided survival maps were placed in double-sided frames.\n\nWhat would Todd have thought of his grandson putting so much effort into restoring, framing and displaying his war memorabilia?\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think Grandpa would have been appalled,\u201d Canestaro says. \u201cIt was not in his nature to draw attention to himself. But I want to pass these things along to my kids, and I will only do it once.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen someone asks, \u2018What is something worth to you?\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Canestaro says, \u201cthis is worth a lot.\u201d\n\n\n\nA blown-up photograph of one of her mom\u2019s vintage Lenox plates hangs behind Deb Baum in her Baltimore dining room. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\nThese days, formal china isn\u2019t often in great demand when family heirlooms are divvied up. But for Deb Baum and her sister, Becca Groothuis, figuring out who is going to get their mom\u2019s gold-rimmed vintage Lenox is a continuing negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe joke about it and call it \u2018the embattled china,\u2019 \u201d says Baum, who admits they\u2019ve been bantering about it since they were children setting the table. For now, the two of them just agree to disagree about the 12 dinner plates and 12 salad plates in a Lenox pattern with a raised fruit motif. And no, they don\u2019t want to divide them in half.\n\n\n\nBaum says encountering a photo of her mom\u2019s china is a comforting daily experience. (Abby Greenawalt/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cGrowing up in Omaha, we always knew my mom was a wonderful hostess, and the china she used for Thanksgiving dinners and Passover Seders was her most special,\u201d says Baum, 43, who now lives in Baltimore with husband Matt and two children.\n\nNobody recalls whether the set was a wedding gift for Donald and Ann Goldstein\u2019s 1970 nuptials or had belonged to another family member. (We sent a photo of the plate front and back to Lenox, and a spokeswoman confirmed that the plate seems to be a rare combination of the Autumn and Westchester patterns and was made between 1918 and 1930.)\n\nAnn Goldstein died in 2011. Now her husband has moved to a condo, and the china is in storage. \u201cNeither of us can let go of it, so it will stay with my dad for now,\u201d Baum says.\n\nBut Baum found a way for both sisters to enjoy the china in the meantime. In 2015, photographer Shana Novak, a childhood friend, started the Heirloomist, a business that specializes in photographing personal artifacts and turning them into bold prints. She has photographed heirlooms of every dimension, from matchbooks and gold pocket watches to wedding dresses and Ellis Island trunks. One woman had her make a six-foot-tall print of a Happy Meal box that once contained an engagement ring and a proposal of marriage.\n\nA dinner plate was shipped to Novak. The photograph she took makes the plate look larger than life. It is displayed in a white wood 42-inch-square frame and hangs on a navy blue wall in the Baums\u2019 dining room. Baum commissioned a smaller version as a gift for her sister, who lives in Chicago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect way to have the china in my home and be reminded of my mom and the rest of the family memories that went along with it,\u201d Baum says. \u201cI like to find meaning in the things that I look at every day.\u201d\n\nLive chat Thursday at 11 a.m. Textiles conservator Julia Brennan joins staff writer Jura Koncius to talk about preserving heirlooms, and all things home and design.
