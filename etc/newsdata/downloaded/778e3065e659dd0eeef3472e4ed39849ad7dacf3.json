Smith and the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which has long studied representation in Hollywood.\n\nExamining 53,178 characters in the top 100 highest-grossing movies from 2007 to 2018 (a total of 1,200 movies), Smith and her team found that speaking roles for \u201cunderrepresented racial/ethnic groups\u201d \u2014 defined as Black, Latino, Asian, Middle Eastern or North African, Native American, Pacific Islander, or multiracial \u2014 increased from 29.3% in 2017 to 36.3% in 2018.\n\nDespite more than a decade of advocacy, the percentage of female speaking characters has not increased. Additionally, we saw no substantial improvement in the percentage or representation of LGBTQ characters or characters with disabilities. Stacy L. Smith, director of USC's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative\n\nThe study also found gains in the number of leading roles for women, women of color, and older women.\n\nBut there remains systemic inequality, and one year of success does not guarantee long-term progress, which similar studies have demonstrated again and again.\n\n\u201cDespite more than a decade of advocacy, the percentage of female speaking characters has not increased,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, we saw no substantial improvement in the percentage or representation of LGBTQ characters or characters with disabilities. It is crucial not to lose sight of these, and other areas, that still need to improve.\u201d\n\nThe study notes that many marginalized groups saw little, if any, gain in representation, and were all but erased from major Hollywood movies. Among the top 100 highest-grossing films of 2018, less than 2% of characters on-screen had a disability, which the study\u2019s authors say is a four-year low. In addition, LGBTQ characters made up only 1.3% of speaking roles in 2018\u2032s top 100 movies.\n\nA number of racial and ethnic groups remained sorely underrepresented, despite the gains overall; There were few Middle Eastern and North African characters, Native American characters or Pacific Islander characters on-screen, the study showed.\n\nUSC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative\n\nAnd while women are getting to lead more blockbuster movies, the number of speaking roles for women overall has barely improved. In the top 100 movies at the box office in 2018, women had 33.1% of the speaking roles. That has hovered either just below or above 30% in each of the 12 years that researchers have conducted the study.\n\nThe study notes that \u201cnot all genres are equal,\u201d pointing out, for example, that women made smaller gains in action and adventure movies, compared with other genres. And women in major movies are still far more likely to be portrayed as sex objects than their male counterparts.\n\nUSC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative\n\nThe study reinforces many findings from similar assessments of diversity and representation (or lack thereof) in pop culture. Some of those note the importance of diversity in Hollywood\u2019s gatekeepers and people in behind-the-scenes roles, such as executives, producers, directors and writers.\n\nFor example, \u201cone explanation for the increase in Black characters can be found behind the camera, as the number of Black directors rose from 6 in 2017 to 15 across the 100 top movies of 2018,\u201d the new study\u2019s authors wrote. Prior research has found that there has been no meaningful change in the number of women directing major Hollywood movies, or in elevating women and people of color in leadership roles.\n\nThe authors also recommend combating implicit bias in hiring, such as employing more inclusive casting processes and avoiding links \u201cbetween a lead character\u2019s identity and that of the film director,\u201d such as wrongly assuming that only male directors can direct male roles.", "description": "A new study from USC's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative finds gains for underrepresented groups in 2018, but also highlights longstanding inequities.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6fe42f2500007e04031e12.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
