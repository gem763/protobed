Mehrtens was part of an extraordinary All Blacks team which reached the final in \u201895 and another which fell in the semifinals in \u201899. Spencer\u2019s prodigious talent wasn\u2019t enough to prevent New Zealand\u2019s semifinal exit in 2003. Carter began in 2003 and played in three other World Cup, winning world championships in 2011 and 2015.\n\nMo\u2019unga is among the most inexperienced to have taken up the pivotal role.\n\nFox was also 25 in 1987 but had been an All Blacks player for three years; Mehrtens was 22 in \u201895 but at the beginning of a record-breaking career. Spencer was 27 in \u201803 and Carter was 25 in \u201807 but had been an All Blacks regular for four years.\n\nThe All Blacks will have few reservations about Mo\u2019unga\u2019s ability to cope with the responsibility hefted upon him. He has already demonstrated composure beyond his years during his test career.\n\nPrior to that he had one of the most high-profile jobs in New Zealand rugby as flyhalf for the Crusaders team which has won 10 Super Rugby titles, three with him at the helm.\n\nHe also followed Mehrtens and Carter into that Crusaders role and it ensured he was fast-tracked into the All Blacks team as he became pivotal to Super Rugby championship-winning campaigns in each of the last three years.\n\nThere were doubters. Because he played behind a Crusaders\u2019 pack which was of almost test strength, he was accused of having a \u201csaloon passage\u201d - an easy ride - as a flyhalf which made him appear better than he was.\n\nBut he demonstrated on his elevation to the All Blacks and when he faced intense pressure early in his test career that he was able to perform under even the most trying conditions.\n\nMo\u2019unga, who is of Tongan and Samoan heritage, had the opportunity to play at the Crusaders under the great Ireland flyhalf Ronan O\u2019Gara who, he said, was often a harsh task-master and sparing in his praise.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been honest with me,\u201d Mo\u2019unga said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a few hard words with me at the start of the year around my goalkicking and a few other things around my game play, which has put me in good stead.\u201d\n\nOpportunity knocked for Mo\u2019unga this season when the All Blacks coaches drafted a dual playmaker style. They intended to use Beauden Barrett at flyhalf and Damian McKenzie at fullback, interchangeably. But when McKenzie sustained a season-ending injury, a gap opened up for Mo\u2019unga. He took it.\n\nHe was tried at flyhalf with Barrett at fullback and after a few faltering steps the combination clicked.\n\nNow Mo\u2019unga has won plaudits for his performances in the pool stages of the World Cup and he seems well equipped for the trial of knockout rugby.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get ahead of yourself,\u201d he said. \u201c(I\u2019m) just taking each moment as it comes, and just really lapping it up.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is just being in the moment and just really diving into the experience (of) what a World Cup is.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup andhttps://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Richie Mo'unga will join a special group within New Zealand rugby when he pulls on the All Blacks No. 10 jersey in Saturday's Rugby World Cup quarterfinal against Ireland.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Mcmorran"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
