They\u2019re just not the same team, there isn\u2019t the same togetherness as last season.\n\nThe body language is different \u2013 from the manager right through to some of their most senior and important \u00adplayers \u2013 and that can\u2019t be right.\n\nInevitably, we\u2019ve heard so many \u00adrumours about problems and bust-ups, about players not wanting to play, even about the manager giving up.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that because I think to get to the level Pochettino has achieved you need a drive and an ego that means you never chuck it in, whether you want to leave or not.\n\nFor me, though, it IS about ego. It\u2019s a fundamental problem that\u2019s long been coming. I\u2019ve seen it so many times in football, and it\u2019s always based around ego.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nYou get players \u2013you get teams \u2013 who when they start winning, start to believe all the BS that pours out \u2013 and some of the people involved start to get a bit greedy.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about money \u00adspecifically here, though that can always be a problem, I\u2019m \u00adtalking more about that view people get about themselves when things are going well.\n\nIt\u2019s a sense of self-\u00adimportance.\n\nI\u2019ve seen it myself in my own career, though never on the scale Spurs are experiencing. There were players at Liverpool who thought they were better than they \u00adreally were \u2013 and got carried along by that.\n\nIt\u2019s such a strange sport.\n\nIt\u2019s a team game based on the talents of the individual.\n\n(Image: Mark Pain/PA Images Contributor)\n\nSides like City and \u00adLiverpool \u2013 and I\u2019d put the Spurs of last season in this category \u2013 no matter how good their \u201cstars\u201d are, they are still a collective greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nYet you are rewarded \u00adindividually, and the biggest \u00adrewards go to the biggest stars.\n\nI see at Spurs players getting greedy, not just for what they can earn, but for acclaim too.\n\nI have to say, \u00adTottenham have found themselves in an almost weird situation. How many players are in the last year of their contract, and big players too? Three, and another four with only 18 months left.\n\nThat\u2019s mad.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhen you have Alderweireld, Eriksen and Vertonghen all in the final year of their contracts, and all variously left out at some point or other, it is clearly getting toxic.\n\nThen add in important players like Rose and Dier also close to the end, it\u2019s not right. Why? It\u2019s so rare for that to happen, and you can \u00adperhaps look at the chairman Daniel Levy and say maybe he\u2019s been found out, maybe his cunning strategies to keep costs down have finally caught up with him.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just like Arsenal where they built a stadium and couldn\u2019t spend on players\u2019 wages.\n\nOr maybe, just maybe, there are other underlying reasons.\n\n(Image: Mark Pain/PA Images Contributor)\n\nYou can\u2019t sugar-coat it. When you get a situation like this, there are always issues at the heart of it. It could be greed, it could be bad faith, it could be the club is a mess and players want out.\n\nWhen the manager wants out too, that gets the alarm bells ringing for me.\n\nI can\u2019t believe so many want out \u00adwithout a fundamental issue that \u00adsuggests it\u2019s toxic.\n\nI\u2019m old-fashioned, though.\n\n(Image: Mark Pain/PA Images Contributor)\n\nWhen I signed a contract, I believed in that club and wanted in. I only ever wanted out when I wasn\u2019t playing \u2013 which is why I left Liverpool.\n\nSo I\u2019ll come back to what I said at the start. Sometimes, people just get greedy in football.\n\nAnd whoever is to blame at \u00adTottenham, whether it be the manager, the \u00adplayers or the chairman (and all have been blamed, haven\u2019t they?), they need to have a long hard look at themselves.", "description": "COLUMN: Spurs have suffered a torrid week after being hammered by Bayern Munich before a dismal defeat at Brighton", "authors": ["Robbie Fowler", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Mark Pain Pa Images Contributor", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20505658.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League-Football-American-Express-Community-S.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
