Hansson, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said today: 'This year's prize goes to contributions to our understanding of the evolution of our universe and Earth's place in the cosmos.\n\n'James Peebles took on the cosmos, with its billions of galaxies and galaxy clusters. His theoretical framework, developed over two decades, is the foundation of our modern understanding of the universe's history, from the Big Bang to the present day.'\n\nAdding a mathematical approach to understanding the cosmos Professor Peebles is credited with uncovering various contributions added to the Big Bang theory through the analysis of relic radiation left over from the light rays which once pierced the hazy universe following the bang.\n\nSpeaking at the awards over the phone James Peebles said: 'When I started working in this subject \u2014 I can tell you the date, 1964 \u2014 at the invitation of my mentor, Professor Robert Henry Dicke, I was very uneasy about going into this subject because the experimental observational basis was so modest. ... I just kept going.\n\n'Which particular step did I take? I would be very hard-pressed to say. It's a life's work.'\n\n\n\nThe awards are the second to be announced this week after the medicine award was given yesterday and the chemistry, peace and literature prizes will follow.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was given yesterday to a team of three \u2013 Dr William Kaelin Jr, Dr Gregg Semenza and Dr Peter Ratcliffe \u2013 for their work uncovering details of how the body's cells react to low oxygen levels.\n\nThe Nobel prizes are some of the most prestigious in the world and arguably the most famous winner of the physics prize is Albert Einstein, who won it in 1921.\n\nHe won the prize for his discovery that light contained electrons which could be absorbed by other atoms.\n\nOther winners include Marie Curie in 1903 for discovering radioactivity; Alexander Fleming in 1945 for developing penicillin; and Watson, Crick and Wilkins in 1962 for revealing the double-helix structure of DNA.\n\nYesterday's victors won the medicine prize for work they did which could lead to new cancer treatments.\n\nSir Peter Ratcliffe is based at the Francis Crick Institute in London, while Dr Kaelin and Dr Semenza are based at Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nCanadian cosmologist Professor James Peebles was the first winner to be announced at the event in Sweden today, and was awarded for his work in the field of cosmology\n\nProfessor Michel Mayor (left) and Professor Didier Queloz worked together to discover the planet 51 Pegasi b in 1995\n\nThe trio's research looked at how the body responds to low oxygen conditions.\n\nWhen we are deprived of oxygen, there is a rise in the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which boosts the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells.\n\nThe researchers found that when oxygen levels drop, a cluster of proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) increases.\n\nIn normal conditions, HIF is broken down quickly and easily. But when there is a lack of oxygen the protein builds up and binds to segments of DNA near the gene for EPO.\n\nThe discovery described a fundamental physiological process that explains how animals can thrive in some of the highest altitudes on Earth.\n\nBut the findings could also prove crucial in a wide-range of fields, from treating diseases to foetal development and exercise.\n\nIn cancer, tumours can hijack the oxygen regulating process and trigger the development of new blood vessels, making it easier for the cancer to grow.\n\nThis is an area that is under investigation for new ways to treat and cure the killer disease.", "description": "Professor Michel Mayor (pictured) and Professor Didier Queloz, both working in Switzerland, will share the prestigious award with Canadian cosmologist Professor James Peebles.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19437568-0-image-a-5_1570529644273.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
