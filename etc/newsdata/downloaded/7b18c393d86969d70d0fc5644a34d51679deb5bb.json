She added two free throws with 35 seconds left in overtime. The Terps beat Duke, 78-75, to earn the program\u2019s only national title.\n\nToliver is one of five Maryland graduates playing in the WNBA Finals. She joins Shatori Walker-Kimbrough (Class of \u201917) and Tianna Hawkins (\u201813) on the Mystics, while Brionna Jones (\u201817) and Alyssa Thomas (\u201914) play for the Sun.\n\nAD\n\nSun at Mystics\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Entertainment and Sports Arena in Southeast Washington\n\nTV: ESPN2\n\nStreaming: WatchESPN\n\nPregame reading\n\nby Ava Wallace\n\nThe WNBA will crown a first-champion Thursday night when Washington hosts Connecticut in a decisive Game 5. Neither the Mystics nor the Sun have ever captured a title, a fact that has been something of a monkey on the back of Washington Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault, whose first season with the Mystics was in 2013 and before that coached Connecticut for 10 years. This is Thibault\u2019s fourth trip to the WNBA Finals and likely the best chance he has to win a championship \u2014 this Washington roster is probably the strongest he\u2019s ever coached.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Mystics, who are playing in their second consecutive finals, have been the most dominant team in the WNBA all season behind a fast-paced, fluid offense that helped them break numerous league and franchise records. They\u2019re led by league MVP Elena Delle Donne, who became the first women\u2019s pro basketball player to join the 50-40-90 club this season, and all-stars Kristi Toliver and Emma Meesseman.\n\nDelle Donne was second in the league in scoring averaging 19.5 points per game this season but has been playing hurt most of this series \u2014 she\u2019s got a herniated disk in her back that\u2019s pinching on a nerve \u2014 and has averaged 12 points in the past two games. Even so, her presence on the court alone helps Washington. Delle Donne, 30, is considered one of the best talents in a generation in basketball, but like Thibault, she too is looking for her first WNBA title.\n\nA win for the Sun would be just as big of a milestone in Connecticut, which returned to the WNBA Finals this year for the first time since 2005. The Sun has almost as much scoring prowess as Washington, with 6-foot-6 Jonquel Jones leading the way and Alyssa Thomas and Courtney Williams backing her up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe keys to a win are about the same for both teams: Whoever wins the battle on the boards and whichever team gets out to a good start will have a huge leg up in the quest for a WNBA Title. For the Mystics, it\u2019ll be important to limit Jones\u2019s touches, especially in the paint, and move the ball well on offense. For the Sun, the goal is aggressive defense and to not let Washington get hot from the three-point line, especially with the Mystics playing on their home court.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Get ready for the winner-take-all game and follow live updates here.", "authors": ["Emily Giambalvo", "Reporter Covering University Of Maryland Athletics", "Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gN33B8L3eRwvJsnUUZOJNTrKbz4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W6CDCMHLXAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
