England Isn\u2019t Convinced, Yet.", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON\u2014American soccer has never known a 21-year-old quite as polished\u2014or quite as expensive\u2014as Christian Pulisic. When he signed with Chelsea in January for $73 million, he more than doubled the record transfer fee for a player from the U.S. His move to the Premier League was the leap that everyone had always sensed was coming.\n\nThe biggest remaining question was, where would he play?\n\nAt his previous club, Borussia Dortmund in Germany, Pulisic had spent most of his time on the wing and, in his final season there, on the bench. Now at Chelsea, it turns out, the star of the U.S. national team is in the exact same spot.\n\nFor all the attention lavished upon him in the early Premier League season, Pulisic has started just three of Chelsea\u2019s five competitive games. And for the past two, he has been an unused substitute. Pulisic might be the American soccer exception for honing his skills in Europe at a young age. But right now, only American soccer feels that makes him exceptional.\n\nAsked about Pulisic\u2019s omission, manager Frank Lampard said, \u201cHe\u2019s in the plans. We\u2019ve got a squad, we\u2019ve got wingers to choose from.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that many of those other wingers look a lot like him: fast, creative, and tidy on the ball with an eye for goal. His style is precisely what all of European soccer has been set up to produce for a decade. So as Pulisic finds his feet in the Premier League, his biggest obstacle is an army of other Pulisics, pumped out by the same European academy system.\n\n\u201cIf you took the name off the back of his shirt and just watched him play, you can see there\u2019s a lot of qualities that he\u2019s got that are based on a European style of football,\u201d said former Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux, who works as an analyst for NBC.\n\nChelsea's Christian Pulisic, left, and Sheffield United's John Egan battle for the ball.

Mason Mount, just 19, is already moving into the center and shaping up to be the Chelsea playmaker of the future. And Callum Hudson-Odoi, 18, has lit up England youth teams for years.\n\nPulisic has faced this type of competition before. At Dortmund, he made his first starts in the 2015-16 season and, within two years, locked down a spot in the starting lineup. But in 2018-19, his appearances tumbled with the emergence of Jadon Sancho, an electric young English prospect shaped by the Manchester City academy. By the end of last season, Sancho was the clear starter and Dortmund had sold Pulisic.\n\nEven without Sancho, however, a move to England had long been in the cards for him. The Premier League is the most watched European league in America and whichever club ultimately signed him knew it would see a bump across the Atlantic.\n\nHe features prominently in NBC\u2019s coverage even when he doesn\u2019t play. Chelsea\u2019s U.S.-specific Twitter account has more than doubled its followers since announcing the signing in January and Google searches for Pulisic spiked in the U.S. over the summer as he prepared to make his Chelsea debut. The only time in his career that curiosity around him had been higher was in October 2017, when he captained the U.S. team that lost in Trinidad & Tobago and missed the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI want to come here and do something that no American has ever done,\u201d Pulisic told Sky Sports in his first interview in England. That bar was set by Clint Dempsey, who scored 57 goals in 213 appearances for Fulham and Tottenham.\n\nIt has been a turbulent time at Stamford Bridge.

The manager has changed, with Lampard replacing Maurizio Sarri, and Chelsea was hit with a transfer ban by FIFA for irregularities surrounding the acquisition of under-18 players. For a club accustomed to spending extravagantly on talent thanks to its Russian oligarch owner, the new approach took some getting used to.\n\nAs far as Pulisic is concerned, the ban cuts both ways. On one hand, Chelsea hasn\u2019t been able to import the kind of expensive talent that might have helped it close the gap to Liverpool and Manchester City, which means he hasn\u2019t exactly joined a title contender.\n\nOn the other hand, the inability to add new players has forced Lampard to make do with the younger players in front of him. \u201cAs you know, we have a ban, that\u2019s why the squad is what the squad is,\u201d he said recently.\n\nAs the season progresses and injuries pile up, that means more opportunities could arise for Pulisic, such as this weekend against Liverpool. He just needs to elbow past Chelsea\u2019s other Pulisics first.\n\n\u201cAt the time they bought him, they didn\u2019t know what was coming down the tracks,\u201d Le Saux said. \u201cIn a way, it could be the best thing that happened to the club.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Is Chelsea a good fit for Christian Pulisic?
