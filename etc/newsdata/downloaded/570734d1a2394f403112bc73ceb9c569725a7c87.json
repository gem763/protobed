He then issued a statement saying the two men agreed that the UK should open the legal text tabled on Wednesday to public scrutiny.\n\nThe Guardian view on the backstop proposals: Britain\u2019s broken promise | Editorial Read more\n\nThe UK has so far only made public a seven-page explanatory document on its proposals. The government has insisted that the full 44-page legal text given to the European commission be kept confidential.\n\n\u201cBoth the president and the taoiseach agreed that they would be in favour of the UK publishing the legal text of their proposal,\u201d a statement from the commission said.\n\nA senior EU diplomat said: \u201cWe want transparency and openness now \u2013 let\u2019s stop playing hide and seek.\u201d\n\nA UK source said: \u201cIt is perfectly normal for proposed legal texts to remain confidential during detailed negotiations.\u201d\n\nPlay Video Boris Johnson says his Brexit deal shows 'great flexibility' \u2013 video\n\nThe extraordinary intervention by the two leaders reveals the plummeting level of trust with Downing Street amid fears the prime minister is merely seeking to blame Brussels for a failure to find a deal.\n\nEarlier in the day, Varadkar had queried Johnson\u2019s response in the Commons to a question from the former cabinet minister Damian Green, a close ally of Theresa May.\n\nThe prime minister had insisted that a customs border on the island of Ireland would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d require new infrastructure for checks and controls.\n\n\u201cI am reassured by what Prime Minister Johnson said today: that he is not proposing that there should be any new physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland linked to customs or customs checks \u2013 but that is actually in contradiction to the papers presented by the UK government yesterday,\u201d Varadkar told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t fully understand how we can have Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in a separate customs unions and somehow avoid there being tariffs and checks and customs posts between north and south.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit? Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts of cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

The EU negotiator stressed that peace in Ireland and the all-Ireland economy were at stake.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michel Barnier speaks to the media outside the EU headquarters in Brussels on Thursday.

Finding out if there is space for a deal will be one of the top points of the agenda for talks on Friday with Frost.\n\nOne EU diplomat said any decision to intensify talks hinged on compromise from the UK: \u201cWhat the EU will test is their flexibility. Are they willing to move more on the customs issue?\u201d the diplomat said, raising one of the EU\u2019s major problems with the proposals. \u201cThis has to happen extremely quickly since time is in extremely short supply.\u201d\n\nNo ambassador wanted to reject the British proposals outright, but they are seeking to understand whether the British will move further, not only on customs, but also on the proposed \u201cStormont lock\u201d, a deeply problematic idea for the EU because it puts the status of Northern Ireland up in the air every four years, and appears to give the DUP a veto.\n\nDespite supportive words from Tory backbenchers, the EU remains far from convinced Johnson can get the deal through the Commons. \u201cThere is a doubt here,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cBoris Johnson has lost every vote in parliament. And we remember Theresa May has said there would be a majority. So maybe it\u2019s history repeating itself.\u201d\n\n", "description": "Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar says PM\u2019s pledge of no hard border contradicts written proposal", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin", "John Crace", "Simon Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd8163c0925679f0b9d892a7e2dd495012c3b1d1/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=00d7e567f1f993294e5f15cec03af05f"}
