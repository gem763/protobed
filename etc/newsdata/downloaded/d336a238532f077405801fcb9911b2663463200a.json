(Photo: Twitter)\n\nOn Wednesday night, New York Times contributor and associate professor at the University of Nebraska, Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet, spoke about her novel Make Your Home Among Strangers to first-year students at Georgia Southern University (GSU). The book, required reading for some of GSU's First-Year Experience classes, focuses on the story of a Cuban-American girl from Miami who is accepted into a prestigious university in New York, and the struggles she faces to fit in with the predominantly white environment.\n\nAt the invitation from GSU, Crucet gave a talk addressing diversity, especially in a college atmosphere. It is one, according to a statement from Crucet, she has delivered at a number of other schools. However, the student's reaction to her lecture was \"nothing close to... any of my previous campus visits.\"\n\nWhen the floor was opened for a Q&A, some students questioned her authority to address white privilege at the predominantly white public university.\n\n\u201cI noticed that you made a lot of generalizations about the majority of white people being privileged,\u201d one student said, according to the university's newspaper, the George-Anne. \u201cWhat makes you believe that it\u2019s okay to come to a college campus, like this, when we are supposed to be promoting diversity on this campus, which is what we\u2019re taught. I don\u2019t understand what the purpose of this was.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came here because I was invited and I talked about white privilege because it\u2019s a real thing that you are actually benefiting from right now in even asking this question,\u201d Crucet said in response, according to the paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s so heartbreaking for me and what is so difficult in this moment right now is to literally have read a talk about this exact moment happening and it\u2019s happening again. That is why a different experience, the white experience, is centered in this talk.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crucet, students immediately began shouting back and forth at one another. While some students raised more questions about race, other students apologized to the author for their peers. Tensions remained high on campus.\n\nSome students believed Crucet made unfair comments regarding white people and claimed the author \"wouldn't stop talking about white privilege\" when she was supposed to be \"promoting diversity.\"\n\n\"I feel that she addressed white students and white people in general unfairly,\" Andre St. Pierre, a freshman at GSU, who attended the lecture, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \"She stated multiple things about white people as a whole that placed all white people in that stereotype of rich and snobby, which is very untrue. Instead of promoting diversity and equality, it\u2019s more like she hated on white people as a whole.\"\n\nIn since-deleted tweets, captured in screenshots and published in the George-Anne, students who attended the lecture tweeted Crucet photos of her book with torn-out pages and accused her of being \u201cracist\u201d towards white people. The paper also shared one student\u2019s tweet, which showed a video of other students burning the book.\n\nyou came to our university as an author of a book all freshmen were required to read, a book you barely talked about. instead, you wasted everyone\u2019s time by attempting to create a racial divide by bullying white people for an hour. that IS racist. you should\u2019ve expected this. \u2014 MT (@morganetracy1) October 10, 2019\n\n\"Are you usually that racist or were you putting on a front to promote your pointless and [sh****] book at my college? [Just] a question,\" one student tweeted (the account has since been deleted). \"[Work] on your ignorance and racism towards white people.\"\n\nIn response to a video of a book burning, one student tweeted at Crucet, \"Maybe that wouldn't happen if you spoke about your book instead of dissing white people the entire time.\"\n\nso after our FYE book\u2019s author came to my school to talk about it... these people decide to burn her book because \u201cit\u2019s bad and that race is bad to talk about\u201d. white people need to realize that they are the problem and that their privilege is toxic. author is a woman of color. pic.twitter.com/HiX4lGT7Ci \u2014 elaina\u2b50\ufe0f (@elainaaan) October 10, 2019\n\nLater that night, captured footage shared on Twitter shows students gathered to burn Crucet's book on campus, which was confirmed by a spokeswoman for GSU. According to a statement shared by the university's Writing and Linguistics department, some students also gathered outside Crucet's hotel.", "description": "After author Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet gave a lecture about diversity at Georgia Southern University, followed by a tense Q&A that brought up white privilege, a group of students gathered to burn her book.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qRJN.jSiEhyeWqgbp_3FJA--~B/aD05ODA7dz0xNzcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/58aae620-ec73-11e9-b773-4157f5553345", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
