He said the company has complied with the FAA directive on inspections but was expanding checks to its entire 737 NG fleet.\n\nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Boeing said all 737 NGs with more than 30,000 flight cycles and about one-third of planes with more than 22,600 flight cycles had been inspected for pickle fork cracks.\n\nThe manufacturer said additional assessments were under way to determine the cause and potential implications for planes with fewer than 22,600 cycles.\n\n\"Depending on the results of these assessments, additional inspections or repairs may be required,\" Boeing said.\n\nAmerican Airlines and United Airlines, whose 737 NG fleets have less than 30,000 cycles, are also inspecting their entire fleets but have not found any pickle fork issues so far, representatives for both airlines said.\n\nReuters", "description": "The cracks are on what is known as the \"pickle fork\" - a part that attaches the plane's fuselage, or body, to the wing structure.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4399%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_41/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7c90da7ce4d0a8ebf8807b70ad521bbde5497bca", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
