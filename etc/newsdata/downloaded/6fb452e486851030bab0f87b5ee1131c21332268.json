Sanders Auctions by Sara Corea, a longtime housekeeper at the Beverly Hilton hotel. Sara wrote in a letter that the 33-year-old singer 'left' the Valentino dress in her room for her after the January awards show.\n\nAccording to Sara, who has worked at the awards show for the past 24 years, she endeavored to return the periwinkle blue gown to its owner, taking the dress to the lost and found department after finding it in Lady Gaga's room. As per hotel policy, the garment was then held for eight months, before it was returned to the finder, Sara, in September.\n\nUh oh! Lady Gaga's custom Valentino gown that she wore to this year's Golden Globes is being put up for auction but the designer is claiming that the dress was stolen\n\nLetter of authenticity: The dress is being auctioned alongside a letter of authenticity written by Beverly Hilton Hotel maid Sara Corea, who says the singer 'left' her the dress\n\nCouture: The costly dress worn by Lady Gaga on the night was reportedly 'left' for a housekeeper named Sara Corea at the Beverly Hilton, as claimed in an accompanying letter\n\nPlace your bids: The custom-created gown with its 10-foot train has been placed online with a starting bid of $8,000\n\nInformation: Paperwork submitted to the auction house with the dress shows that Sara left it with the lost and found on January 8, 2019, three days after the Golden Globes\n\nSara then decided to put it up for auction with a starting price of $8,000.\n\nBut the situation has gotten murky as sources now allege that the dress was not Lady Gaga's to gift, or leave behind, as it remains the property of design house Valentino - helmed by designer Pierpaolo Piccioli - which has reportedly filed a report with the Beverly Hills police saying that the gown has been stolen.\n\nAccording to TMZ, law enforcement sources confirmed that someone from Valentino made an incident report with Beverly Hills Police on Friday about the missing dress.\n\nThe issue is reportedly being worked out between the hotel and designer.\n\nIt's believed that the dress will likely be taken down from the auction block.\n\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com, a spokesperson for Nate D. Sanders said that the auction house believes the housekeeper to be the rightful owner of the gown, saying: 'Nate D. Sanders Auctions prides itself on having legitimate and correct provenance on all items it places in the company's monthly auctions.\n\n'We have been made aware of a question concerning the provenance of the Lady Gaga dress being auctioned on October 31. Our research confirms the dress was given to the Beverly Hilton lost and found department, where it stayed for almost nine months.\n\n'The hotel, in accordance with its longstanding policy, released the dress when no one claimed the item. The consignor has a receipt from the Beverly Hilton lost and found department and documentation, which accompanies the dress for auction.'\n\nCovering the bases: Sara's letter was written both in Spanish and English\n\nHow to buy: Bidders can find the dress on Halloween on auction house Nate D. Sanders website\n\nFour star: Lady Gaga reportedly 'left' the dress behind for the housekeeper at the Beverly Hilton hotel, where the Golden Globes is hosted\n\nThe Beverly Hilton reiterated the auction house's denial that the dress had been stolen, but noted that it is conducting an investigation into the gown's 'rightful owner'.\n\n'While we are still conducting an internal investigation to understand all the facts, we have no reason to believe the item was stolen,' a spokesperson told DailyMail.com. 'We are working with all parties to retrieve the item and have it returned to its rightful owner as soon as possible.'\n\nIn her letter, Sara, who found the dress wrote: 'I work as a housekeeper at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. I'm always present working in the Golden Globe events on January ever year for 24 years.\n\nDesigner: Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino; it is unclear whether Valentino has reported the dress stolen as alleged by TMZ\n\n'The artist (singer) 'Lady Gaga' left me this dress that she used the day of the awards (won first place because of the dress.)\n\n'I turned in the dress to the lost and found on the 8th of January 2019 after the time legally held by lost and found they gave it to me as a gift from her and today I want to auction the dress.'\n\nTypically, hotels keep 'lost and found' items for three-six months. According to Nate D Sanders, the dress was returned to Sara on September 3.\n\nThe four-star Beverly Hilton, where the Golden Globes is hosted annually, uses the automated service Chargerback to make the lost and found process as seamless as possible.\n\nTo retrieve their forgotten items, a guest can log onto the site and enter a description. If there's a match, they will be contacted to arrange shipping arrangements with the hotel.\n\nHowever, it is not known whether hotel personnel tried to contact Lady Gaga before placing the dress in lost and found, although, given the uniqueness of the design, it is likely to have been easily identifiable as belonging to the singer.\n\nBut who owns the dress? As the gown was created specifically for Lady Gaga, it is unknown whether it is the property of Valentino or the 33-year-old singer\n\nHomage: The Valentino gown worn by Lady Gaga on the night is a tribute to a dress worn by Judy Garland in the 1954 version of A Star Is Born\n\nWhile it is customary for fashion labels to loan stars outfits for awards season, as it is a custom-created piece the dress may be the property of Lady Gaga herself.\n\nFamous co-stars: Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga smile on stage during the Golden Globe Awards\n\nThe periwinkle gown with its 10-foot long train was designed specifically for the New York-born performer; likely an ode to a similar number worn by Judy Garland, who featured in the original version of A Star is Born in 1954.\n\nHer stylists, Tom Eerebout and Sandra Amador, have not responded to request for comment.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the lot, it is currently available to view on Nate D. Sanders Auctions, however it will not be available for bids until Thursday, when potential buyers will be able to try and purchase the design, which has a starting price of $8,000.\n\nAt the Golden Globes 2019, Lady Gaga won the accolade for Best Original Song for her track Shallow in A Star Is Born, and she praised her co-star and director Bradley Cooper in her speech, thanking him for his support.\n\n'Thank you, Bradley Cooper. You took our heartfelt honest tune and you gave it emotional resonance,' she said, offering up a special shout out to the actor, who was sitting in the audience.\n\nLady Gaga made history in 2019 as the first person to win an Oscar, Grammy, BAFTA and Golden Globe in a single year.", "description": "Lady Gaga's custom Valentino gown that she wore to the Golden Globes is being put up for auction.
