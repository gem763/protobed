But it did offer a glimpse of the uncapped 27-year-old Somerset all-rounder\u2019s potential as a \u201cfinisher\u201d in this format and, despite shipping 27 from two overs with the ball, he feels ready to take his chance if picked for the first game in the five-match series in Christchurch.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d said Gregory. \u201cThere\u2019s a few cobwebs with the ball today. I\u2019ve not played a T20 for a while \u2013 I missed most of the T20 this year. But I 100 per cent back my ability. If I get a crack, I\u2019ll go out there and perform.\u201d\n\nComing into a white-ball set-up that is fresh from victory in this summer\u2019s 50-over World Cup has also been instructive for Gregory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys who have played a lot of international cricket have been very welcoming. The guys are bouncing ideas off each other.", "description": "Lewis Gregory says he is ready to make his full international debut in Friday\u2019s opening T20 international against New Zealand after his brutal batting cameo in Tuesday\u2019s final warm-up match.", "authors": ["James Watson", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000214461689-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6u9zJSHFvGCXLFCAr8F4pZOszImzbu6HI66BjQVXI_Y.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
