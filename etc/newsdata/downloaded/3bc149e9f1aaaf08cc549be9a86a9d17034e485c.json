To do it twice, with the second free-kick even better than the first, felt genuinely seismic for Nicolas Pepe, the club-record signing who chose a desperate, gruelling night of Europa League football to properly announce himself as an Arsenal matchwinner.\n\nA group of players that has relied so much on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette to bail them out of trouble will now know that they can also turn to Pepe when the going gets tough. It certainly got tough here, so tough that at times it felt like this would become one of the worst nights of Unai Emery\u2019s tenure.\n\nArsenal had no creativity, no control and, to be frank, no ideas for much of the game. But they did have \u00a372 million worth of elite attacking quality in Pepe, who curled Arsenal back into the game and then did it all over again to win the match in the 92nd minute.\n\nEmery\u2019s verdict? \u201cThe two goals from Pepe were perfect,\u201d he said. He also reckoned Arsenal deserved to win, which felt like a stretch given the nature of their first-half performance, in particular, against a Vitoria SC side that has not won an away game in Europe since 2005.\n\nThe Portuguese side were organised in defence and devilish in attack. In Marcus Edwards they had a former Tottenham Hotspur prodigy who looks more than capable of one day fulfilling the potential that once prompted Mauricio Pochettino to call him a \u2018mini Messi\u2019. Edwards scored their first before Bruno Duarte added a second just minutes after Gabriel Martinelli had equalised for Arsenal.", "description": "To do it once was impressive enough.", "authors": ["Sam Dean", "Daniel Zeqiri", "Live Updates", "Alan Tyers", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000214038699-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8CYWv7bmnYZ51d2hDBu7lXDCpTwQ6nZ61gIVqF1ln0s.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
