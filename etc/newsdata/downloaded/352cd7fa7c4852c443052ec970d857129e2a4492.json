Through the power of inertia it has pushed masses of the population into retirement saving.\n\nAnd this is not a finite problem nor one that will disappear given enough time. In fact, the exact opposite - more and more people will fall foul of this pension scheme lottery.\n\nGive dukes and dustmen the same pension boost Ex-shadow Pensions Minister Gregg McClymont warns the Government to play fair on top-ups here. 'Low-paid workers are being failed by a pensions lottery,' TUC boss Paul Nowak told This is Money here.\n\nIn October last year the then Chancellor, Philip Hammond, committed to creating an economy that worked for all.\n\nHowever, he then proceeded to exacerbate the net pay issue by increasing the personal allowance to \u00a312,500.\n\nIncreasing the allowance, which is a pretty regular occurrence in the Budget, widens the gap between the auto-enrolment threshold and the basic rate of income tax.\n\nThis means more people than ever, who are doing what they should by saving into a pension, are now losing the Government pension tax relief top-up.\n\nOn top of the growing gap created by the Government, we are seeing an increase in multi-jobbers.\n\nMany people who have several jobs with lower pay will miss out on the Government top-up more than once and it will accumulate to have a dramatic impact on their future prosperity.\n\nIf the new Prime Minister and Chancellor want to make names for themselves by fixing issues and quirks in the system that are unfairly impacting working people then the net pay issue should be high on their agenda, even if it isn\u2019t dominating front pages.", "description": "Pensions expert Ian Browne, of Quilter, says some low earners could be losing \u00a38k in lifetime savings - a 14% chunk of their total pot - due to a tax flaw the Government has failed to fix.", "authors": ["Ian Browne For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
