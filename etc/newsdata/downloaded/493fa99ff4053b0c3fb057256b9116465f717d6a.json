Altuve answered with a two-run drive to left-center, setting off a wild celebration at Minute Maid Park and earning himself AL Championship Series MVP.\n\n\u201cBeautiful game,\u201d Altuve said.\n\nAstros ace Gerrit Cole was waiting to pitch a potential Game 7 on Sunday. Instead, the postseason star - undefeated since May 22 - could be lined up for Game 1 at home against the NL champion Washington Nationals on Tuesday night.\n\nYuli Gurriel hit a three-run homer in the first inning, and flashy outfield defense helped Houston\u2019s relievers defeat the Yankees and their vaunted bullpen.\n\nIt almost fell apart in the ninth. Gio Urshela singled off Osuna leading off for his third hit of the game, and LeMahieu put a ball into the first row of seats in right field - inches over the glove of leaping George Springer - to tie it at 4.\n\nAltuve, a sparkplug touted as Houston\u2019s heart and soul, didn\u2019t let this one get away.\n\n\u201cI get asked to describe Jose Altuve all the time,\u201d manager AJ Hinch said. \u201cI think MVP is what he is.\u201d\n\nThe teams combined to use 14 pitchers in a game that lasted 4 hours, 9 minutes.\n\nHouston\u2019s bullpen got a lift from flashy outfield defense. Right fielder Josh Reddick dived for Brett Gardner\u2019s liner for the second out of the sixth. An inning later, left fielder Michael Brantley laid out for Aaron Hicks\u2019 shallow floater and doubled off Aaron Judge at first.\n\nGurriel, a holdover from Houston\u2019s 2017 championship team, was 1 for 20 to start the ALCS before his drive in the first inning. The shot into the Crawford Boxes was his first connection this postseason.\n\nIt\u2019s the third time Houston has eliminated New York in the past five postseasons. The Astros won the 2015 wild-card game in the Bronx and beat the Yankees in seven games in the 2017 ALCS before winning their first title.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go win the World Series,\u201d Hinch said in the clubhouse before popping the cork off a bottle of champagne.\n\nWashington is seeking its first championship in the 51-season history of the Montreal Expos/Nationals franchise. The original Washington Senators won their only championship for the nation\u2019s capital in 1924 and last reached the World Series in 1933 before becoming the Minnesota Twins for the 1961 season.\n\nGary S\u00e1nchez had an RBI single in the second and Urshela homered in the fourth.\n\nAlex Bregman gave the Astros an insurance run with an RBI on a forceout in the sixth inning.\n\nBrantley\u2019s double play elicited one of the loudest ovations of the night - before Altuve\u2019s blast - from the sellout crowd of 43,357 which included Hall of Famers Nolan Ryan and Craig Biggio and Rockets stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who watched from the front row in personalized orange Astros jerseys.\n\nNew York lost its fourth straight ALCS after falling in 2010, 2012 and 2017. The Yankees will go without a World Series appearance in a calendar decade for the first time since the 1910s.\n\nAltuve doubled off opener Chad Green with one out in the first inning and Bregman drew a walk with two outs. After a short visit to the mound, Gurriel knocked the next pitch into the seats in left field for a 3-0 lead. The runs were Houston\u2019s first with two outs in the series.\n\nHouston had been 4 for 40 with runners in scoring position before that big swing.\n\nBrad Peacock, who threw eight pitches in a scoreless eighth inning Friday night, became the fourth pitcher ever to finish a postseason game and then start the next day, and the first since 1924.\n\nHe needed seven pitches to retire the side in the first before running into trouble with two outs in the second. Josh James ended the inning by striking out Gardner.\n\nRyan Pressly had another gutsy escape, too. He hurt his right knee again fielding a bases-loaded grounder by Didi Gregorius but limped over to tag him for the final out of the third. Pressly, who grimaced as he went toward the dugout after one pitch, had arthroscopic surgery on the same knee on Aug. 22 and returned Sept. 20. Pressly also got two strikeouts with the bases loaded in Game 4.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jose Altuve, the 5-foot-6 driving force of Houston, delivered a swing that will play in Astros' highlights forever.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/alcs_yankees_astros_baseball_40606_c0-148-3549-2218_s1200x700.jpg?0d25299784b611d3dcc52981408defae898ca012", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
