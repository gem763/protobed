USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Reeling from the growing threat of impeachment, President Donald Trump takes to the campaign trail for the second day in a row on Friday, when he will stump for not one but two GOP candidates for governor in Louisiana.\n\nTrump will travel to Lake Charles, La., where he will speak at a GOP rally on the eve of the state\u2019s gubernatorial election.\n\nThe event follows Trump\u2019s appearance at a campaign rally Thursday in Minneapolis, where he slammed House Democrats for launching an impeachment inquiry against him and stepped up his attacks on Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunner, and his son Hunter.\n\n\"He was never considered a good senator,\" Trump said of Biden. \"He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\"\n\nBiden, who participated in a forum on LGBTQ rights on Thursday, wrote on Twitter that he had spent the evening talking about \"the fundamental respect every human being deserves\" while Trump spent his \"how little respect for anyone else you have.\"\n\n\"America is so much stronger than your weakness,\" Biden tweeted.\n\nMinneapolis rally: Trump steps up attacks on Joe Biden and his son\n\nImpeachment will likely be a central theme of Trump\u2019s speech in Louisiana, where he also will try to fire up GOP voters ahead of the state\u2019s gubernatorial election on Saturday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is greeted by a cheering crowd at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minn., Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019.

John Bel Edwards, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South. Edwards is leading in the polls, but the GOP is trying to drum up support for both of its candidates and prevent Edwards from getting at least 50 percent of the vote on Saturday.\n\nIf that happens, the top two vote-getters would be forced into a runoff, which Republicans believe would boost their chances of taking back the governorship.\n\nEarly Friday, Trump previewed his message to Louisiana voters.\n\n\u201cI will be in Louisiana tonight (Love it!) to get Republicans to vote for either of our two great Republican Candidates and force a run off with John Bel Edwards, who has done a really poor job of tax cutting, car insurance cost (worst in USA), & is suspect on your 2nd Amendment!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn a second tweet, he added: \"We will hopefully add a Great New Republican Governor to the beautiful Louisiana mix! See you tonight!\"\n\nI will be in Louisiana tonight (Love it!) to get Republicans to vote for either of our two great Republican Candidates and force a run off with John Bel Edwards, who has done a really poor job of tax cutting, car insurance cost (worst in USA), & is suspect on your 2nd Amendment! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2019\n\nTrump, who is not expected to endorse either of the GOP candidates, predicted earlier this week the race would \u201cmost likely\u201d be forced into a runoff.\n\nIf so, Edwards would be only the second Louisiana governor in modern history to face a runoff. Democrat Edwin Edwards was pushed into a runoff in 1987 but conceded the race to fellow Democrat Buddy Roemer before voters went back to the polls.\n\nKey witness: US Ambassador to EU Gordon Sondland, key impeachment witness, will testify\n\nCLOSE Protesters clashed with supporters outside a rally in Minneapolis. Some burned MAGA hats and threw urine in the streets. USA TODAY\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance at Friday\u2019s rally is the third in a week by a high-profile Republican on behalf of the two GOP candidates.\n\nAt a rally last Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence tied the gubernatorial race to the 2020 presidential election, telling supporters that \u201cwe need Louisiana to send a Republican to the governor\u2019s office and for Louisiana to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all starts here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all starts now.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., campaigned on behalf of Abraham and Rispone at a rally in Lafayette on Monday.\n\nContributing: Courtney Subramanian, Greg Hilburn of the Monroe Star News\n\nTrump and special elections: Trump's special elections record boosted by Bishop's win in North Carolina.
