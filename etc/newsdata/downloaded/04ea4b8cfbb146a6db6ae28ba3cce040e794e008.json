This month, her second outpost opens in the West Village. The bar is notable for being entirely funded by women (it has 33 investors, all of them female) and for its insistence on serving Champagne in wineglasses, which, says Pelka, allows imbibers to experience all of the different aromatic notes.\n\nIf juggling two wine bars across the country wasn\u2019t enough work, Pelka is also the founder of Magnum PR, a leading restaurant public relations agency in San Francisco with clients like Sweetgreen and Shake Shack. She began her career working for chef Daniel Boulud and also spent time at OpenTable, Gilt Taste, and Tumblr before striking out on her own.\n\nSince the Riddler New York was still under construction, we caught up with Pelka at the Marlton, a space she frequents for meetings. Read on to hear about her favorite red lipstick, the chic laptop bag she brings to meetings, and how her style evolved from shopping in the Gap sales aisles.\n\nPhoto: Gabriela Herman\n\nOn the shoes she wears every day: When I\u2019m running around town, I\u2019m in a black jumpsuit with sneakers. Some of my favorites include my custom white leather Converse chucks. They have the inscription \u201cUne Femme,\u201d which is the Champagne brand I\u2019m launching this fall with my brother. I also love Nike iD, and I make a new pair whenever my old ones wear out. It\u2019s a great use of $65! And if I\u2019m on the floor of the restaurant, I\u2019ll wear black flats \u2014 loafers, mules, or Chelsea boots.\n\nOn going out after work: I\u2019ll swap my sneakers for a pair of heels and add a red lip. As for lipsticks, I\u2019ve tried them all, and Make Up Forever\u2019s True Red is the best. It\u2019s a beautiful color, stays on all day, and never dries my lips out. Literally every time I wear this lipstick, someone will stop me and ask what I\u2019m wearing!\n\nOn what she wears to big meetings: You\u2019ll find me in a black dress with a black leather jacket. I usually have a few jackets in rotation and I\u2019m currently obsessed with this cropped Veda one worn over this Mara Hoffman dress. Then I\u2019ll add on statement heels and my go to bag by Clare V. It\u2019s the perfect size for my laptop and looks so chic. I have two \u2014 one in black snakeskin, and another in black calfskin. And of course, I\u2019ll add on a red lip.\n\nOn her uniform: You\u2019ll often see me wearing black on black in the form of dresses or jumpsuits by the likes of Prabal Gurung, Rachel Comey, or Oak & Fort. And then I\u2019ll add color via my shoes or bag. I\u2019m also fond of a red lip with red nails. As far as jewelry goes, my Cartier tank watch is always on my wrist. My husband gave it to me for Christmas a few years ago.\n\nOn drinking Champagne: At the Riddler, we prefer drinking our Champagne and sparkling wines like any wine \u2014 out of a wineglass, so we can swirl them, get a sense of the aromatics, and really explore the complexities of the wine. When you travel to Champagne, you see that all of the winemakers drink their Champagne out of wineglasses, not flutes. The CEO of Krug, Maggie Enriquez, told me that drinking Champagne out of flutes was like listening to a symphony with earplugs in: You can only sense the loudest notes. But we\u2019re not snobs! If you\u2019re joining us and prefer the flair of flutes, just ask your server. We have a few on hand for those who prefer it. We also have delicate Zalto Burgundy stems and elegant hand-cut Belarusian crystal coupes.\n\nOn the Riddler\u2019s decor: My bar\u2019s a direct reflection of my personal style. The color palette is all about black and brass, with touches of vintage mixed metals throughout. Our banquettes were made by a team that constructs furniture for the likes of Chanel and Louis Vuitton. We bought a set of long booths and reupholstered them in a rich vintage black leather. Our\n\nbathroom is modeled after my dream residential bathroom \u2014 you\u2019ll see black walls, black molding, a black ceiling, and black furniture, plus Byredo soap and candles.\n\nOur team will be wearing dark-gray French-style Tillit work jackets with black jeans and black Chelsea boots. The women can wear a red lip and red nails. So, yeah, it\u2019s very me!\n\nOn who she dresses for: During the day, my wardrobe is all about function: I need to get shit done and that\u2019s why I wear sneakers. I can\u2019t even imagine running around town in heels during the day. But at night, I\u2019m more dressed up. I think of myself as an embodiment of my brand, and I\u2019ve got to look the part.\n\nOn how her style has evolved: I\u2019ve tried to move away from fast fashion and into investment pieces. I grew up as a T.J. Maxx scavenger and a Gap sale-aisle girl, so it took me a long time to come around to the philosophy of \u201cfewer, better things.\u201d I now think about how things will fit into my wardrobe and extend my style for a long time.\n\nOn the last three things she bought: These Paige gunmetal gray loafers. I\u2019m wearing them to the opening of Pace Gallery. I also picked up a white Mara Hoffman coat and gold Gorjana necklaces that I can layer.\n\nOn what she wears to look impressive: I have two vintage fur pieces that I absolutely love and reserve for very special nights out. One is a black opera coat with a fox collar that I bought at an estate sale, and the other is a brown-and-black mink stole from the Alameda Flea Market in California. There\u2019s nothing I love more than stepping out of a cab into a snowy winter night in one of them. It always feels like a scene from a movie, and is the exact feeling I love about being in New York.\n\nShop the Story\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "In the latest In Her Shoes we talk to The Riddler\u2019s founder Jen Pelka.
