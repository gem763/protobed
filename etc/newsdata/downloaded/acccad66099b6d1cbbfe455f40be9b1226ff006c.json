It just settled with the FTC.", "language": "en", "text": "For those who know their skin care products, Sunday Riley is a beloved brand. Good Genes face acid is a best-seller at Sephora and frequently hailed as a holy grail product. But the company got some unwelcome scrutiny at this time last year after a former employee shared on Reddit an email allegedly directing employees at the company to open fake accounts and leave glowing Sephora reviews of Sunday Riley products.\n\nThe deception shocked some customers and served to highlight the questionable trustworthiness of online product reviews at retailers like Sephora. On Monday, the FTC offered the company an arguably generous settlement that again got people talking.\n\nAfter the initial leak, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against the brand, alleging Sunday Riley made misleading claims in the reviews and didn\u2019t disclose that the company was behind them. The FTC had copies of several emails, including from founder and CEO Sunday Riley herself, encouraging employees to use a \u201cvirtual private network\u201d (VPN) to leave reviews that would be untraceable to the company\u2019s IP address. (Apparently Sephora had gotten wind that some of these reviews were not from legitimate customers and had been deleting them.)\n\nThe FTC has offered a settlement with Sunday Riley that includes agreeing it will never write fake reviews again. The company was able to accept the settlement without admitting any wrongdoing. It is not being otherwise fined or punished in any other way.\n\nBut the decision was not unanimous within the FTC. Two of the five commissioners, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, contested what amounted to a slap on the wrist in a strongly worded letter, shared with Vox by Commissioner Chopra\u2019s advisor.\n\nThe letter read in part:\n\nGoing forward, the FTC should seek monetary consequences for fake review fraud, even if the exact level of ill-gotten gains is difficult to measure. The agency should also comprehensively analyze the problem of fake reviews, including whether or not ecommerce firms have the right incentives to police their platforms...Today\u2019s proposed settlement includes no redress, no disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, no notice to consumers, and no admission of wrongdoing. Sunday Riley and its CEO have clearly broken the law, and the Commission has ordered that they not break the law again.\n\nNeither Sunday Riley nor Sephora responded to requests for comment.\n\nHow Sunday Riley planted fake reviews on Sephora\u2019s website\n\nIn October 2018, a user and supposed former Sunday Riley employee calling themselves \u201cthrowawayacctSRiley\u201d posted on Reddit and shared a copy of an email that clearly shows that employees had been asked by the company to register as fake Sephora users in order to leave glowing reviews for new acne products that the company was launching. The email laid out in great detail how employees should register as reviewers to avoid having their IP address traced back to the company, and to leave reviews on other brands as well to avoid drawing suspicion to themselves. It was recommended that employees set up several different profiles and \u201cmix and match your identities.\u201d\n\nThe most eye-opening section of the email reads:\n\nIt helps to make yourself seem relatable \u2014 like you know how hard acne is and you\u2019ve tried everything, and this one actually works or mention things like, yes it\u2019s a little more expensive but works incredible [sic] well compared to the cheaper masks out there. If you need any help with things to come up with to say, feel [sic] to ask myself, Sunday, or Addison. As reviews come in, read them too. If you notice someone saying things like I didn\u2019t like \u201cx\u201d about it, write a review that says the opposite. The power of reviews is mighty, people look to what others are saying to persuade them and answer potential questions they may have.\n\nIt caused a huge commotion in the beauty world, racking up over 500 comments on r/skincareaddiction. And the news only got bigger when Sunday Riley confirmed that it was true. A brand representative wrote in the comment section of the anonymous beauty industry watchdog/gossip Instagram account Estee Laundry:\n\nAs many of you may know, we are making an effort to bring more transparency to our clients. The simple and official answer to this Reddit post is that yes, this email was sent by a former employee to several members of our company. At one point, we did encourage people to post positive reviews at the launch of this product, consistent with their experiences. There are a lot of reasons for doing that, including the fact that competitors will often post negative reviews of products to swing opinion. It doesn\u2019t really matter what the reasoning was. We have hundreds of thousands of reviews across platforms around the globe and it would be physically impossible for us to have posted even a fraction of these reviews. Client word-of-mouth, sharing how our products have changed their skin, has been the cornerstone of our success. In the end, our products and their results stand for themselves.\n\n(Sunday Riley did not return Vox\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nResponses were swift and decisive. Fans of the brand on Reddit commented things like, \u201cJoke\u2019s on Sunday Riley, even if they actually have good products now I\u2019ll never believe it because of their manipulation\u201d and \u201cAs someone who suffers with acne, I find this extremely upsetting. Advising your staff to write a review saying a product cleared your acne is preying on the vulnerable.\u201d\n\nPeople have strong attachments to brands, especially when it comes to skin care. This was largely seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe FTC complaint alleges that this practice had been going on for about two years, between 2015 and 2017. Riley herself reportedly told employees to create at least three accounts \u201cregistered as different identities,\u201d to use the VPN, and to dislike negative reviews so that they would be removed. \u201cThis directly translates to sales!!\u201d she wrote.\n\nSo how common is this practice, really?\n\nOnline reviews are really important to brands. Studies have shown that customers trust products that have a lot of reviews, and it\u2019s human nature to look to peers and \u201creal people\u201d for their opinions. It\u2019s why, especially for makeup and other beauty products, so many people follow bloggers, YouTubers, and Instagrammers. They\u2019re perceived to be authentic (though recent drama in that world has revealed that their reviews can sometimes be purchased for a lot of money).\n\nThis is not the first time the authenticity of online reviews has been called into question. Amazon has been singled out frequently in stories alleging that brands pay people to write reviews. It happens enough that there are now even plenty of tips for recognizing when a review might not be what it seems.\n\nIn 2017, I reported on this phenomenon in the beauty industry for Racked. There are a variety of companies that offer free products in exchange for \u201chonest\u201d reviews, and small brands admitted feeling pressure to solicit fans to leave positive reviews. But this is the first time a major brand has been called out on the practice, with receipts. It provides insight into the way the beauty industry sells products, and how cutthroat and dishonest it can be.\n\nSunday Riley is likely not alone here. \u201cThis happens a lot. Sephora puts the pressure on brands \u2014 they really \u2018encourage\u2019 reviews,\u201d says a beauty industry source who wished to remain anonymous so as not to jeopardize their relationship with Sephora and beauty brands. \u201cWhen you have a new launch, the sales will increase with a ton of good reviews. I do want to reiterate how common this practice for brands is. Sunday Riley just got caught. I\u2019m not defending it, but it\u2019s a vicious cycle.\u201d\n\nCaroline Hirons is a popular and well-respected UK-based skin care blogger and beauty brand consultant. She posted a sponsored video with Sunday Riley a few days prior to this controversy and worked as a consultant to the brand five years ago. She says she was never asked by the brand to post any sort of fake review, and wouldn\u2019t ever agree to do so. But she concurs that it\u2019s a common practice in the industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the brands. The direction comes from the retailers,\u201d Hirons, who has called out the practice in the past on her blog, says. She notes that she\u2019s never had a request quite as detailed as the Sunday Riley email, though. \u201cI\u2019ve never come across anything that organized. I\u2019ve just had verbal requests in retailer meetings.\u201d (She also clarifies that she\u2019s never heard those requests from UK-based retailers like Space NK, Cult Beauty, or department stores like Selfridges.)\n\nIn Hirons\u2019s skin care fan group on Facebook, which has almost 10,000 fans, a user shared a screenshot of communication she had supposedly had with Sephora\u2019s customer service department after she\u2019d asked about the Sunday Riley issue. The email read: \u201cThank you for taking the time out of your day to reach out to us about this matter. We have recently found out about it and we are looking into it. We do not condone this type of activity. Rest assured we are working diligently on this.\u201d It was signed \u201cJazlyn, Sephora Client Services.\u201d\n\nSephora provided the following statement to Vox at the time:\n\nAt Sephora, we believe in the power of the beauty community and that knowledge should be shared to benefit all. Sephora has very strict brand rules regarding our Ratings and Reviews, which we know are an important decision tool for our clients. Additionally, we have teams dedicated to protecting the integrity of our Ratings and Reviews, ensuring through detailed moderation that it\u2019s a constant trusted, unbiased, authentic source for all. We do not believe this incident is representative of the Sephora Ratings and Reviews culture, or the countless hours our clients have spent sharing their product experiences with us and others. We\u2019ve been in touch with Sunday Riley on this matter, and they have committed to adhering to our review policy.\n\nThe pressure to sell\n\nThe shelves of Sephora are crowded, and competition in the beauty industry is fierce. Brands, especially small ones, are under a lot of pressure to sell and to conform to the whims of retailers. Retailers often hold a lot of the cards. (Read this cautionary tale about Sephora and the now-defunct makeup brand OCC for an example of how this can sometimes play out.)\n\nA small brand owner who wished to remain anonymous wrote in an email to Vox, \u201cWe are under a lot of pressure to drive reviews for our products on Sephora.com, but Sephora\u2019s site is also really good about weeding out reviews that aren\u2019t legitimate, so it\u2019s very hard to build up a product page by leaving a large number of \u2018fake\u2019 reviews.\u201d\n\nSunday Riley has struggled in the past few years, facing a lawsuit about false advertising, which was eventually tossed out. It also launched a foundation called The Influencer earlier in 2018, which is no longer available. It\u2019s been actively trying to build its business in the UK, launched a wellness-focused beauty box, and relaunched its website. It\u2019s not clear that this settlement will either affect Sunday Riley\u2019s business or protect consumers going forward.\n\nAs FTC Commissioner Chopra wrote: \u201cThis settlement sends the wrong message to the marketplace. Dishonest firms may come to conclude that posting fake reviews is a viable strategy, given the proposed outcome here. Honest firms, who are the biggest victims of this fraud, may be wondering if they are losing out by following the law. Consumers may come to lack confidence that reviews are truthful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all just a modern-day example of the old adage, \u201cBuyer beware.\u201d As one redditor suggested, perhaps be wary of any review that\u2019s too glowy, and head for mediocre territory: \u201cThis is why I tend to trust only the reviews that are 3 stars. That\u2019s where the honesty is.\u201d\n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox?
