The paper\u2019s decision was largely rebuked online, even becoming the number one trending topic with the hashtag #CancelNYT.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS MAINSTREAM MEDIA AS 'SCUM' AND 'ANIMALS' DURING PRIVATE EVENT, CRITICIZES WHISTLEBLOWER: REPORT\n\n\u201cY\u2019all really doxxed the whistleblower? If anything happens to him/her, it\u2019s on you, #CancelNYT,\u201d tweeted one person.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s heroes are worth far more than clicks and views. Doxxing the whistleblower endangers the individual\u2019s life, which is especially heinous considering the whistleblower went through proper government channels. The NYT protects Trump sources better than this. #CancelNYT,\u201d wrote Dr. Eugene Gu.\n\nIn addition to canceling subscriptions, others even called for the firing of Times\u2019 executive editor Dean Baquet.\n\n\"Dean Baquet should absolutely lose his job over this. Quickly. The damage to the whistleblower's safety is already done, but @nytimes must condemn this decision to protect future sources & whistleblowers. This cannot be left as an acceptable precedent. #CancelNYT,\" Twitter user @KristinMinkDC wrote.\n\nBaquet responded to the criticism in an article published Thursday night saying the Times decided to publish \u201climited information\u201d about the whistleblower to give him credibility against Trump\u2019s claims that the unidentified person was a \u201cpolitical hack job.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president and some of his supporters have attacked the credibility of the whistle-blower, who has presented information that has touched off a landmark impeachment proceeding,\u201d Baquet said. \u201cWe wanted to provide information to readers that allows them to make their own judgments about whether or not he is credible.\u201d\n\nREPUBLICANS WANT WHISTLEBLOWER'S SOURCES, AS INCONSISTENCIES IN COMPLAINT EMERGE\n\nCritics online appeared unfazed by those who defended the paper, such as Times contributing writer Wajahat Ali, who called on the public to \u201creconsider\u201d their decision to cancel their subscriptions.\n\n\u201cIt employs fantastic journalists & breaks important stories. It's also under direct assault from Trump & his supporters,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI write for them but I also publicly disagree w/ some decisions, like today's. Yet, the good far outweighs the bad.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMany online expressed that they had enough with the Old Gray Lady, which had caught backlash for a string of editorial gaffes including a report last week on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe supposed bombshell piece failed to mention that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed and did not recall the purported sexual assault.", "description": "Calls to cancel subscriptions to the New York Times reached fever pitch on Thursday night following outrage over the newspaper\u2019s decision to identify the Trump whistleblower as a CIA official.", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
