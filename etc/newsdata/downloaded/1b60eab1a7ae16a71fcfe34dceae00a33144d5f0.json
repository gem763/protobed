USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Clayton Kershaw cut to the chase.\n\nHe's had to do this a few times before.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t win the last game of the season and you\u2019re to blame for it, it\u2019s not fun,\u2019\u2019 he said Wednesday night following the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 season-ending loss to the Washington Nationals. \u201c\u2026Yeah, it\u2019s just a terrible feeling.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Kershaw-induced nausea of the Dodgers\u2019 7-3, 10-inning loss in Game 5 of the National League Division Series unfolded like this:\n\nTop of the eighth. Dodgers led 3-1. Out came Kershaw, pitching in relief.\n\nFirst batter: Anthony Rendon. The Nationals slugger blasted Kershaw\u2019s second pitch for a home run into the left field bleachers.\n\nSecond batter: Juan Soto. Batting cleanup for the Nationals, the 20-year-old crushed Kershaw\u2019s very next pitch 449 feet to right-center.\n\nThree pitches. Two home runs. Just like that, the Nationals were tied 3-3 and Kershaw was on his way to the showers.\n\n\u201cYou know, I had a job to do. Get three outs,\u2019\u2019 Kershaw said.\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE: Braves' first-inning meltdown will go down in history\n\nMLB PLAYOFFS: We need a new award to celebrate October greatness\n\nIn fact, Kershaw had gotten an out. A big one.\n\nIn the top of the seventh, with two outs and runners on first and second, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts brought in Kershaw to replace starting pitcher Walker Buehler. Kershaw promptly struck out Adam Eaton on three pitches and ended the scare.\n\nBut an inning later, Kershaw served up the homers to Rendon and Soto.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuses. Just didn\u2019t make pitches,\u2019\u2019 Kershaw said and later added, \u201cEverything people say is true right now, about the postseason. I understand that.\u2019\u2019\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts faced criticism and questions after the game about why he sent Kershaw back out for the eighth after he had gotten the big out an inning earlier.\n\n\"For him to make himself available tonight and get us out of a big spot right there,\" Roberts said. \"it just didn't work out. There's always going to be second-guessing when things don't work out, but I'll take my chances any day on Clayton.\"\n\nKershaw in the dugout after being removed in the eighth inning.

But in 158 \u2153 career postseason innings, he has a 4.33 ERA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get down about it about myself,\u2019\u2019 Kershaw said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to feel sorry about myself. I just feel sorry for these guys in this (clubhouse) room. That\u2019s about it.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd how long will it take to get over this latest disappointment?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to do it so much, I don't know,\" Kershaw said. \"It might linger for a while. I might not get over it. I don't know.\n\n\u201cBut spring training\u2019s going to come, I\u2019m going to have to be ready to pitch and do the job the best we can.\u2019\u2019", "description": "Three-time Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw blew a two-run lead in the eighth inning as the Dodgers crashed out of the NLDS vs. the Nationals.", "authors": ["Josh Peter", "Published A.M.
