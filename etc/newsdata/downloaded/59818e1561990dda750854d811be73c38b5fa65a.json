The crushing departures occurred just days before the Libra Association formalized its structure in Geneva on Monday.\n\nSeveral Trump administration officials and lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned with Facebook\u2019s immense market power and global reach. The project also raised alarms among financial regulators, who urged the company to tread carefully or risk a federal crackdown.\n\nWhile Libra\u2019s founders insist they will wait for Washington\u2019s green light before launching, the company\u2019s critics are pouncing to stop the project in its tracks.\n\n\u201cFacebook is too big and too powerful, and it is unconscionable for financial companies to aid it in monopolizing our economic infrastructure,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown Sherrod Campbell BrownTrump administration blocked consumer watchdog from public service loan forgiveness program: report Democrats fear Ohio slipping further away in 2020 Sherrod Brown: 'Terrible mistake' for Democratic nominee to support 'Medicare for All' MORE (Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cI trust others will see the wisdom of avoiding this ill-conceived undertaking.\u201d\n\nThe forces behind Libra have battled intense scrutiny from Washington since Facebook in June announced its plans to launch the project by 2020. The payments system would allow users to send and receive money transmitted through a proprietary cryptocurrency called Libra, which could be stored along with other virtual currencies like bitcoin.\n\nThe Libra Association is legally separate from Facebook, which is but one of the close to 180 businesses backing the project. Even so, the social media company\u2019s deep involvement with Libra has raised alarms among lawmakers who warn Facebook can\u2019t be trusted in the financial services sector.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned Facebook is aiming to shield itself from financial oversight by US regulators, which would explain their establishing a charter in Switzerland instead of Silicon Valley,\u201d Rep. Lance Gooden Lance GoodenCritics pounce as Facebook crypto project stumbles House committee pressing Zuckerberg to testify on digital currency Libra GOP lawmaker introduces measure to remove Nadler as Judiciary chairman MORE (R-Texas), a member of the House Financial Services Committee who recently joined a congressional trip to Switzerland to discuss Libra with regulators, said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nFacebook\u2019s reputation has soured in Congress after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw a right-leaning public relations firm obtain data on hundreds of millions of Facebook users without their consent or knowledge. Lawmakers grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergHouse investigators receive initial documents from top tech companies Hillicon Valley: Warren turns up heat in battle with Facebook | Instagram unveils new data privacy feature | Advocacy group seeks funding to write about Big Tech Warren turns up heat over Facebook's ad rules MORE about the privacy breach over multiple fiery hearings last year and have since battered the company over concerns that it has amassed too much control over the lives of Americans and allowed foreign entities to manipulate Facebook\u2019s platform to sow discord during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFacebook, which has more than 2 billion monthly users worldwide, is facing antitrust investigations from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and key lawmakers in the House, a threat that has rattled the company.\n\nDaniel Ives, an analyst and managing director with the investment firm Wedbush, described the company as \u201cthe center of the beltway firestorm\u201d over Big Tech.\n\nFacebook seems to be signaling that its executives are not intimidated by federal investigations into its market power and that it intends to push ahead.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJust after consumer group Public Citizen this week accused Facebook of seeking to \u201centrench [itself] as an unparalleled global monopolist,\u201d the Libra Association signed up its first 21 member organizations.\n\n\u201cFacebook is trying to send a signal that they\u2019re not going to back down and they\u2019re going to go on the offensive,\u201d Ives said.\n\nFacebook has sought to distance Libra from its poisonous reputation, highlighting the other partners in the project. But Facebook\u2019s missteps have left the company with little credibility among politicians and K Street insiders.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. I don\u2019t think anybody buys that at all,\u201d said a financial technology industry lobbyist. \u201cAs much as Facebook wants to say that this isn\u2019t a Facebook program, they\u2019re putting their CEO up to answer for it.\u201d\n\nThe Libra project faces a crucial test next week when Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. He\u2019ll likely face a slew of pointed questions about the project and must satisfy the numerous regulatory concerns posed by Libra\u2019s massive reach and complicated structure.\n\nLawmakers pressed David Marcus, head of Libra, at a prior hearing for answers about how the project would comply with the complex web of banking, illicit finance, securities and money transferring regulations likely applicable to Libra.\n\nIn a letter to House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters Maxine Moore WatersThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Video depicting Trump killing media, critics draws backlash Backlash erupts at video depicting Trump killing media, critics Cindy McCain condemns video of fake Trump shooting political opponents, late husband MORE (D-Calif.) over the summer, Marcus insisted, \u201cWe want, and need, governments, central banks, regulators, non-profits, and other stakeholders at the table and value all of the feedback we have received.\u201d\n\nWhile Marcus vowed to satisfy all concerns raised by regulators, lawmakers fumed as he offered little insight into how Libra could be supervised by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve seen nearly every household name involved with Libra pull out of the project \u2014 the risks are not worth the rewards,\u201d Rep. Brad Sherman Bradley (Brad) James ShermanCritics pounce as Facebook crypto project stumbles This week: Congress returns to chaotic Washington Trump impeachment efforts will haunt the next Democrat in the White House MORE (D-Calif.), one of the project\u2019s top antagonists in Congress, said in a statement to The Hill. \u201cI hope next week\u2019s hearing will help Mark Zuckerberg recognize these risks, so that he can join his corporate partners in dropping this project.\u201d\n\nTop federal regulators have also questioned Facebook\u2019s plans, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Libra raises \u201cmany serious concerns\u201d about financial stability.\n\nThe departure of top financial services firms Visa, Mastercard and PayPal underscores how steep the path to winning Washington\u2019s approval will be for Libra, said Ian Katz, managing partner at policy advisory firm Capital Alpha Partners.\n\n\u201cThey were seen as the adults in the room, the entities that have experience with payment networks and the know-how to thwart illicit transactions,\u201d Katz wrote in a Sunday research note. \u201cThey could return to the association at some point, but as long as they\u2019re absent, the Libra effort is seriously weakened.\u201d\n\nBoth Visa and Mastercard, established financial institutions, are subject to serious regulatory scrutiny and likely balked at a project that put them at odds with some of the top regulators in the country, Katarina Pistor, director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center on Global Legal transformation, told The Hill.\n\nYounger companies like Uber, Lyft and Spotify have remained on board, signing on to become some of the founding Libra Association members on Tuesday. In a statement, Spotify described the project as \u201cin its early stages\u201d but noted it will continue \u201cexploring the opportunity offered by the Libra Association to empower billions of people globally, especially in financially underserved markets.\u201d\n\nAll of the member companies are expected to put $10 million toward launching the controversial cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cFor many companies, it was a relatively cheap option to put $10 million in to get a sense of where this is going, what they could learn from it,\u201d Pistor said. \u201cThe price of that option changed when the regulatory costs increased.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, the Libra Council \u2014 the association\u2019s top governance body \u2014 consists of 21 members, down from the 28 originally announced. But the organization is barreling ahead as it defends the project from critics and detractors.\n\n\u201cDespite all the regulatory noise and scary headlines, I still think it will launch in the U.S.,\u201d Ives said.\n\nBut, he added, the public hearing starring Zuckerberg next week won\u2019t make the effort any easier.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a lot of grandstanding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be time to get the popcorn out.\u201d\n\nChris Mills Rodrigo contributed.", "description": "Facebook\u2019s ambitious plan to launch a global virtual currency is faltering under growing skepticism from business partners, politicians and financial regulators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/librafacebook.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
