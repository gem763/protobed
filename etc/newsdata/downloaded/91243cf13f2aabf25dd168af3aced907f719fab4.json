The pair opened their first store, then called Fashion 21, in 1984 and pulled in $700,000 worth of sales in the first year.\n\nThe retailer thrived through the early 2000s, eventually peaking in 2015 when its founders were worth a record high of $5.9 billion combined, Forbes reported.\n\nToday, reports of messy stores and empty displays combined with store closures in major markets have put the company behind some of its fast-fashion competitors. Forbes estimates that the cofounders are no longer billionaires.\n\nOn Thursday, Forever 21 denied to Business Insider that it had imminent plans for bankruptcy, despite reports.\n\n\"Our stores are open and it is our intention to continue to operate the vast majority of U.S. stores, as well as a smaller amount of international stores, providing customers with great service and the curated assortment of merchandise that they love and expect from Forever 21. Please visit our store locator to find the most up to date store list,\" the company said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHere's the story of the company, from its quick rise to global prominence to its slow downfall into uncertainty.", "description": "Forever 21 is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.
