In a deal with prosecutors, the charges against him were downgraded from three counts of felony rape to two counts of second-degree sexual assault.\n\nAnd his victims say they had no idea.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I heard was that [the prosecutor] was going to go for 20 years in prison,\u201d Browning told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd then the next thing I know is, \u2018Hey, he\u2019s pleading tomorrow and it\u2019s going to be 120 days in county jail and five years probation.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes you want to throw up,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nThe Pulaski County prosecuting attorney\u2019s office told The Daily Beast that the victims were aware of Winne\u2019s plea before his hearing date. John Johnson, the chief deputy prosecuting attorney, said the plea bargain was the best possible outcome based on the facts of the case. Winne\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWinne, 40, was arrested last October for allegedly assaulting Kate McConathy at his private Little Rock massage studio. McConathy told police it was her second appointment with the masseur, who had been recommended to her by a friend.\n\nMuch like her first appointment, McConathy told investigators, Winne stressed how injured she was and asked if she trusted him. When she said yes, she claims, he stuck his gloveless finger inside of her. Later, she says, he warned her not to tell her friend what had happened.\n\nMcConathy told police she was afraid to resist Winne because they were alone in his studio. She also says he told her the assault was a legitimate medical procedure\u2014an attempt to reach her \u201cdonut muscle.\u201d It was only after speaking with her roommate\u2019s mother\u2014a registered nurse\u2014that McConathy realized the donut muscle does not exist. Her roommate told police McConathy burst into tears when she realized what had happened.\n\n\u201cYou're supposed to be able to trust licensed medical professionals,\u201d McConathy told The Daily Beast at the time. \u201cYou shouldn't have to worry about, when you go into an appointment, that you're going to be sexually assaulted.\u201d\n\nIn the course of investigating McConathy\u2019s claims, the police uncovered at least three other women with similar allegations. One was a former client who claimed Winne assaulted her at a local chiropractor\u2019s office years earlier.\n\nDuring a routine massage, the woman said, Winne began rubbing his penis against her arms until he became erect. She reported the incident to the chiropractor, who fired Winne for sexual misconduct. (In his application to Massage Envy years later, court records show, he would not list the chiropractor\u2019s office in employment records.)\n\nTwo other women told police that Winne had groped them during appointments at Massage Envy, just a few miles down the road from where McConathy was assaulted. The first, who did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment, told police he groped her breasts and penetrated her with his finger during a massage in 2012.\n\nWhen the woman reported the incident to Massage Envy, Winne claimed she had been flirting with him and playing with herself under the draping\u2014claims she strongly denied.\n\n\u201cThere was actually a whole lot of victim-blaming in this conversation,\u201d the woman later told investigators of her experience with Massage Envy staff. \u201cAsking me why I didn\u2019t leave sooner, why I didn\u2019t say something, why I did not leave right away or come to the front desk as soon as it was over. Things like that.\u201d\n\nDiscouraged, the woman decided not to report to police. She says the spa later offered her a free one-hour massage.\n\nFour years later, Browning made her report to Massage Envy. She later told police she was referred to Winne by her mother, who had received massages from him for years. In fact, she said, she often requested her mother\u2019s presence during massages because of Winne\u2019s odd behavior. He always required her to be naked under the draping, she said, and once massaged the area around her vagina so hard it left bruising.\n\nBut at her final appointment, Browning said, Winne asked her mother to leave the room, and again began moving his massage toward her vaginal area. When she told him to stop, she said, he explained he needed to reach a specific muscle group. Then, Browning claims, he stuck an ungloved finger inside of her.\n\nBrowning and her mother reported the incident to the Massage Envy franchise owner, who brought in Winne for a recorded interview. According to the police report, the masseur admitted on tape to touching Browning inappropriately, claiming his hand \u201caccidentally slipped.\u201d He also admitted to asking her mom to step out of the room.\n\nWinne lost his job at Massage Envy, but Browning never reported him to police. She later said her mother and the franchise owner told her it would be a case of \u201che said, she said.\u201d Describing the incident to investigators later, her mother broke down in tears.\n\nIn her final report on the investigation\u2014for which she interviewed Winne and four of his accusers, spoke to their family and friends, and reviewed the taped interview\u2014Little Rock Detective Paige Cline was decisive.\n\n\u201cDuring my investigation, I have developed a behavioral pattern of Thomas Winne that is frightening,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThomas Winne used the naive and young mentality of these victims to satisfy his \u2018sexual predator behavior\u2019 while being a massage therapist.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWhat I find most disturbing about this whole investigation is how many more victims are out there that might have been raped and/or sexually assaulted at the hands of Thomas Winne.\u201d\n\nProsecutors eventually charged Winne with three counts of felony rape in connection with McConathy\u2019s allegations and the two incidents at Massage Envy. The charges were all classified as \u201cY\u201d felonies\u2014the most serious offenses under Arkansas state law. If convicted at trial, he would have faced a potential life sentence.\n\nOne year after Winne was charged, McConathy says, she received a call from the prosecutors office telling her that Winne had taken a plea deal. The charge from her and Browning\u2019s complaints had been lowered to second-degree sexual assault, and the one connected to the third woman was dropped completely. She says the office presented the deal as a win.\n\nIn a local TV interview that week, McConathy said she was unsatisfied with the plea, but relieved about not having to testify. But in the days that followed, she says, her disappointment turned to anger.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a win for any of the victims,\u201d McConathy told The Daily Beast this week. \u201cIf they\u2019re just going to go from three life sentences to 120 nonconsecutive days in jail, why would I go through all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my options were to go to trial or for him to get what he got, I would for sure 100 percent go to trial,\u201d she added.\n\nBrowning, meanwhile, says she found out about the plea deal when she called the prosecutor's office to see if she should show up for the trial scheduled that week. Instead, she was told she could go to the courthouse the next day to see Winne take his plea. When she confronted prosecutor Sam Jackson at the hearing, she says, he told her the plea deal was \u201csomething we could all live with.\u201d She left before the proceedings began.\n\nJackson was not available for comment, but Johnson told The Daily Beast he is \u201ca dedicated prosecutor that is in this job for all the right reasons.\u201d Of Browning, he added, \u201cYou can\u2019t stop someone from attributing comments to someone when they\u2019re mad at them\u2026 She\u2019s going to have to live with whatever she\u2019s saying about him.\u201d\n\nJohnson said his office downgraded the charges after learning new information in their interviews with the victims that made it \u201cdifficult if not impossible to prove the force element of rape.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe entered into a negotiated plea, with [the victims\u2019] knowledge, in the hopes that we would be able to mete out some degree of punishment against this person for what he\u2019d done, and in the hopes that other victims would be protected from being sexually assaulted in the way these young women were assaulted,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson declined to state for the record what information had changed prosecutors' minds. Browning and McConathy say they were never informed of any issues with their statements, and McConathy said she never spoke at length with prosecutors about the details of her case.\n\nTiffany Murphy, a professor at the University of Arkansas Law School, said it would take a significant difference between the victims\u2019 interviews and the police report to merit such a reduction in charges. And if the victims were still prepared to testify, she added, it raised questions about why exactly the prosecutors changed their minds.\n\n\u201cSomeone thought this was serious enough at some point in time to charge three counts of first-degree rape,\u201d she said, adding later: \u201cSomebody in that office, for whatever reason, didn\u2019t see it was truly a first-degree rape.\u201d\n\n\"If the women are onboard, then you\u2019re looking squarely at the prosecutor,\" she said.\n\nIn an email to Browning, Jackson said he was \u201cvery satisfied with the outcome\u201d of the case. He emphasized that Winne is now registered as a habitual offender, meaning any further convictions will make him ineligible for parole. He was also required to register as a sex offender and surrender his massage license. His nursing license is currently on hold.\n\nUnder Arkansas state law, habitual offenders convicted of two or more violent crimes serve a mandatory sentence or life. McConathy said that, despite the outcome of her case, she hopes that more victims will step forward.\n\nBut even that rang hollow for Browning.\n\n\u201cI hate the feeling that we\u2019re just waiting for another victim before he actually goes down,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just another girl that gets hurt.\u201d", "description": "He could have faced life if convicted of the top charge at trial, but women found at last minute that prosecutors had made a deal.", "authors": ["Emily Shugerman", "Gender Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570833868/181011-shugerman-massage-plea-bargain-tease_c3cx1l", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
