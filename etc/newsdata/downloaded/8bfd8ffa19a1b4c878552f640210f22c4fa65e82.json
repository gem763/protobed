However, by launching two separate RFT -- one for SAP and another for PeopleSoft -- it hopes that it will result in two separate contracts.\n\n\"DFAT's preference is that these contracts will be with different suppliers,\" the document said.\n\nDFAT noted though that it would not rule out choosing one supplier for both RFT, \"if this is considered to represent best value for money to DFAT\".\n\nFor the two separate tenders that are being conducted in parallel, DFAT said successful suppliers would be responsible for transitioning each of the current ERP system support services from the incumbent service provider, as well as having to plan, operate, establish, and accept all new services and capabilities.\n\nSee also: Top 5 ERP systems that will help your enterprise digitally transform (TechRepublic)\n\nAt the same time, each supplier will be required to provide ongoing provision of support, maintenance services, service delivery management services, enhancement office services, and ERP system partnership services.\n\nSome of the business objectives that DFAT is seeking to achieve through the RFT include strengthening its performance management framework, having a strategic partner to help optimise its investment and value in the current ERP system, and establishing a technology roadmap to migrate from the current ERP system to a new ERP platform or a centralised whole-of-government ERP arrangement.\n\nThe delivery timeframes for each project are expected to commence in February 2020 before concluding by 31 May 2020.\n\nUpdated at 9.47am AEST, 9 September, 2019 : DFAT has informed ZDNet that Capgemini Australia is its current contractor that provides support, maintenance, and enhancement services for both its SAP and PeopleSoft ERP systems.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nDFAT backs automation of awful manual process for facial verification\n\nA computer could not do a worse job than what the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has in place already, its submission argues.\n\nDFAT enjoying freedom to innovate outside of classified government network\n\nHaving its innovationXchange platform outside of the government network allows the foreign aid team to sneak in innovation on behalf of its other departmental segments.\n\nForeign Affairs and Trade on the hunt for collaboration-as-a-service platform\n\nThe Australian-hosted 'collaboration' platform will be used to work on national security, global economic developments, and international aid policy.", "description": "It currently contracts a single supplier for both ERP systems, but now it wants to separate it.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/04/25/50e0c628-53c9-4a25-94ab-1c56ea592319/thumbnail/770x578/2727bf31a58f7778b849920b61a89869/erp.jpg"}
