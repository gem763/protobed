Charles E. Schumer told the Senate Republicans to drop their \u201csee no evil\u201d approach to the Ukraine corruption saga that is consuming Washington, urging Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to demand a whistleblower complaint that flagged President Trump\u2019s behavior and was deemed credible by a Trump-appointed inspector general.\n\nIn a letter, Mr. Schumer told Mr. McConnell to force Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, and other top officials to testify on events that led to the complaint, which is reportedly tied to Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDemocrats say Mr. Trump appeared to pressure the foreign leader to dig up dirt on his main 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and his son Hunter as $250 million in U.S. aid money to Ukraine hung in the balance.\n\nMichael Atkinson, inspector general for the intelligence community, said the person who blew the whistle on the president\u2019s interactions submitted a complaint that was credible and of \u201curgent concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet in the face of this dire warning and the Trump administration\u2019s effort to cover it up, the Republican-led Senate has remained silent and submissive, shying away from this institution\u2019s constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. The Republican Senate\u2019s \u2018see no evil, hear no evil\u2019 attitude toward such a serious national security concern is unacceptable and must change,\u201d Mr. Schumer wrote to Mr. McConnell.\n\nMr. Trump on Sunday suggested he did bring up Mr. Biden and his son during the call with Mr. Zelensky, though he insists he did nothing wrong and that Mr. Biden should face scrutiny instead.\n\nAs a practical matter, Senate Republicans are Mr. Trump\u2019s main firewall against removal from office, if the situation escalates and House Democrats vote to impeach.\n\nAt least one Senate Republican, Mitt Romney, is sounding the alarm, said it\u2019s \u201ccritical\u201d for the facts to come out.\n\nMr. Schumer said Republicans should subpoena the whistleblower complaint over White House objections and request a transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky.\n\nThe New York Democrat also wants to identify any administration officials involved in holding up the Ukrainian aid money \u2014 it was released Sept. 12 \u2014 and force the Justice Department to offer a legal opinion on its reasons for withholding the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cThis is a whistleblower complaint that has been labeled \u2018urgent\u2019 and \u2018credible\u2019 not by Democrats, but by a senior-level Trump appointee,\u201d Mr. Schumer wrote. \u201cIt is the Senate\u2019s duty to take this national security matter seriously and to take action now.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
