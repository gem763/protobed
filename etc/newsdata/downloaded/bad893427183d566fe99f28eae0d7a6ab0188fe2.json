You don\u2019t have to take my word for that. Just take a look at the results of a survey the market conducted among the people that have that, shall we say, misfortune.\n\nSome 6,000 people responded. One in 12 of them reported having witnessed incidents of sexual harassment during the last 12 months. One in five don\u2019t believe employees have equal opportunities. It should be stated that women\u2019s responses were more negative than those of men.\n\nAnd there's more. Nearly half (45 per cent) said they wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with raising concerns about improper conduct. Some 38 per cent said they didn't even know who they might approach. Two in five of those that did know, and raised concerns, didn\u2019t feel they were listened to.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNearly a quarter said they\u2019d witnessed excessive boozing, two in five per cent said they felt under excessive pressure to perform, more than a fifth reported negative impacts on their health from their work.\n\nThe market's issues were first brought to light through a Bloomberg report in which an atmosphere of \u201cnear persistent harassment\u201d was described by several women who worked or who had worked there. Since then there has been a steady drip feed of negative headlines.\n\nCEO John Neal says that he is determined to tackle the issues the reports, and the survey, have raised.\n\nTo that end, there is a five point action plan, a gender balance plan, which includes targets, standards of business conduct have been outlined for individuals and companies that do business at Lloyd\u2019s. An advisory group charred by one of its directors, Fiona Luck, will hear from \u201cleading experts on different aspects of cultural transformation\u201d. A campaign to encourage people to speak up is underway.\n\nSo lots going on. Busy, busy, busy.\n\nBut the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.\n\nAn institution like Lloyd\u2019s, with a long history and a deeply engrained \u201cold school\u201d City of London culture, is not going to change easily.\n\nA good start would be for miscreants to be jumped on as swiftly as possible, always bearing in mind that the law has to be respected as even Boris Johnson has had to learn.\n\nThis might cause people who are rarely under paid to at least think about the way they conduct themselves.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

They aren't very flattering.\n\nIt found that one in six respondents don\u2019t believe their organisation\u2019s top people take responsibility, especially when things go wrong. More than a fifth have seen bosses turning a blind eye to bad behaviour.\n\nIt has been noted that A$550,000 (\u00a3300,0000) of Neal\u2019s bonus was withheld while he was running Australian insurer QBE as a result of his failure to disclose a romantic relationship with his executive assistant.\n\nThe company\u2019s annual report declared that \u201csome recent personal decisions by the CEO have been inconsistent with the board's expectations\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

More to the point, he also made it clear that his bonus, and those of other senior managers at the market, will take a hit as a result of these findings and if the market doesn't shape up in future.\n\nSo it should.
