I would love to marry him but it\u2019s not even legal. We don\u2019t even want to get engaged yet until it\u2019s legal and then we can do our thing.\n\n\u2018So hopefully, I\u2019ll inspire people and hopefully , one day we\u2019ll be able to get married in our own country.\u2019\n\nBlu had a strong start on Drag Race UK Picture: BBC)\n\nWhile she wants to use Drag Race as a platform, Blu is also feeling the pressure: \u2018Especially when you find out you\u2019re the only queen from a whole island! The other queens are like, I\u2019m repping for Leeds! I\u2019m repping for the whole of Ireland.\u2019\n\nBlu, who describes herself as \u2018queen of the makeup brush\u2019, had a strong star on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK with her Belfast-inspired runway look, which saw her strapping the Harland and Wolff cranes to her back.\n\nShe said: \u2018I\u2019m representing Belfast. The Harland and Wolff cranes helped build the Titanic and also my dad and my grandad worked on them.\u2019\n\nBut that was overshadowed by her Queen Elizabeth realness look, which saw Blu dressed as a pound coin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race continues on Thursday nights at 8pm on BBC Three.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
