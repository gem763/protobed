Haskell will formally step into this role on April 1. He has worked at the company since 2007 in a variety of roles, most recently as editor for business and strategy (since late 2016), shaping the magazine and editing features while also leading editorial strategy for books, film, television, podcasts, and events across the magazine and its digital verticals. He will be the eighth editor-in-chief in the magazine\u2019s 50-year history.\n\n\u201cWhen Adam told me that he\u2019d be stepping down, it was quickly apparent to me that David should be the person to succeed him, and I\u2019m thrilled that he accepted the challenge. He is a brilliant editor, boundlessly creative, and always inventive in the service of our journalism. We have worked closely together, particularly in the last two years, when he has helped us to establish new business ventures that build on our legacy in exciting ways. I know that he will uphold the highest standards of excellence and delight our readers,\u201d said Pam Wasserstein.\n\n\u201cDavid Haskell is a superb editor with wide-ranging curiosity, unerring taste, reverence for talent and mastery at making magazines. Especially useful at this juncture, he is also a natural and proven entrepreneur, and he will be a perfect partner to Pam Wasserstein going forward. I have known David his entire career and I am confident New York Media\u2019s creative future across multiple arenas is in excellent hands,\u201d said Adam Moss.\n\nDavid Haskell has been an editor at New York since 2007, when he was invited by Adam Moss to guest-edit a special issue on London. He has edited almost three hundred features for the magazine, and was the captain or co-captain of 14 special issues, including My New York (the 50th Anniversary Issue), Hope and What Came After (a retrospective of the Obama years), The Apartment and Scandal! (the first two of a series of \u201cyesteryear\u201d anniversary issues), and My First New York (about notable New Yorkers\u2019 arrivals in the city, which he then expanded into a book published by Ecco/HarperCollins). He has edited much of the magazine\u2019s longform political coverage and has played an important role in assembling the magazine\u2019s roster of political writers in print and online. In his current role developing editorial growth projects, he\u2019s worked off of the philosophy that the company\u2019s editorial excellence\u2014what he calls \u201cits intelligence and wit and curiosity, its magazine legacy, its culture of innovation and ambition\u201d\u2014is its greatest business strength. He secured a four-book deal with Simon & Schuster, which began with Highbrow, Lowbrow, Brilliant, Despicable (the story of a half-century of New York City, seen through the lens of New York); and helped launch the Artist Covers project, the Cut on Tuesdays podcast, the How I Get It Done event series, the Cut\u2019s t-shirt line, Vulture\u2019s collaboration with TruTV, the magazine\u2019s collaboration with OnlyNY, and many Hollywood projects. He has also worked closely on the launch and development of the Strategist, helping expand the magazine section into a digital publication whose business success is directly linked to how entertaining and trustworthy it is to read.\n\n\u201cFor almost twelve years, New York Magazine has been my family, Adam my mentor and friend, and the work we publish my favorite to read. It\u2019s hard to imagine New York without Adam, but at the same time, his fingerprints are all over this place\u2014and he is leaving us having built the finest editorial department in our 50-year history. I\u2019m wildly grateful to him for this legacy, and to Pam for trusting me with the future of this very special place,\u201d said Haskell. \u201cWe are living through an extraordinary time in American life, one eerily well suited to New York\u2019s strengths and obsessions. It\u2019s now my job to make sure we cover it all with the intelligence and creativity our readers have come to expect.\u201d\n\nBefore coming to New York, Haskell edited Topic Magazine, which he co-founded as a graduate student at Cambridge University in 2002 and brought to New York City in 2004. He was at Cambridge in the inaugural class of the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, studying architectural history and living partly in Barcelona, where he researched the political use of architecture in the post-Franco years. He graduated from Yale in 2001 and was a Truman Scholar class of 2000.\n\nA testament to his entrepreneurial spirit and creativity, Haskell has two meaningful outside projects. He co-founded Kings County Distillery in 2009 with his college friend Colin Spoelman. It makes award-winning whiskey in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and was the American Distilling Institute\u2019s Distillery of the Year in 2016. Haskell remains a leader and co-owner of the business, with Spoelman the CEO and full-time head. Together, they wrote two books published by Abrams: The Kings County Distillery Guide to Urban Moonshining, and Dead Distillers. Haskell also makes ceramics, mostly wheel-thrown, working out of Sculpture Space in Long Island City. He is represented by Donzella in Tribeca and regularly shows plant-specific work at Coming Soon in the Lower East Side.\n\nHe lives in Chinatown with his husband Esteban Arboleda and turns 40 on April 10th.\n\nWasserstein sent this note to the company\u2019s staff this afternoon:", "description": "He has worked at the company since 2007 in a variety of roles, most recently as editor for business and strategy (since late 2016).", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/press/2019/01/16/DavidHaskell.w1200.h630.jpg"}
