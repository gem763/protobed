Maybe he doesn\u2019t know \u2013 whether due to pharmaceuticals or simply because he\u2019s stupid \u2013 that two Democratic administrations ago, right up the road, the feds sent a bunch of armed men to take the forbidden guns of some people who were minding their own business and it turned out poorly. That debacle resulted in four dead ATF agents and over 70 dead civilians \u2013 including dozens of kids the feds burned alive.\n\nToo bad that ridiculous dwarf George Stephoplatypus didn\u2019t query The Waco Kid on how many Waco reruns he and his fascist friends are willing to accept to show us rubes who\u2019s boss.\n\nAfter all, that\u2019s what this AR-15 immoral panic is all about. There are 20 million scary fake \u201cassault weapons\u201d out there in the safest of all possible hands \u2013 that of American citizens for use in defending themselves, their families, their communities and their Constitution. How many of them were used this year by scumbags to hurt other people in the mass shootings that get exponentially more coverage than the blue city bloodbaths that are exponentially worse?\n\nWe had what? Two recent incidents? Two? In Chicago, two shooting incidents is a slow hour. Two in 20 million \u2013 I like those odds.\n\nThis dream of unleashing the cops (and who knows \u2013 the Army too?) on Normal Americans is designed to arouse the impotent urban libs who desperately want to flex their puny muscles and humiliate us by stripping us of that which makes us citizens and not serfs. Oh, and the fringe benefit is that we could no longer resist the kind of Cuban tyranny these creeps dream of imposing. For the elite left, gun bans are a twofer.\n\nOh, that\u2019s crazy talk that is very crazy, you crazy person of craziness!\n\nReally? As part of Scat Francisco\u2019s continuing campaign to convert my novels into nonfiction, its local Politburo declared that the NRA is a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d and promised all sorts of nasty consequences for firearms dissenters. That\u2019s right \u2013 a government body in a progressive cesspool explicitly outlawed a group of American patriots because the goosesteppers-by-the-Bay dislike these Americans\u2019 political views. Since the Bill of Rights is now the Bill of Suggestions, what other thoughts and opinions will they outlaw? Christianity seems pretty unprogressive \u2013 how about banning that? Everyone but those insufferable pinko Unitarians are terrorists!\n\nBut hey, if we Normals disarm the elite will suddenly do a 180 and start totally respecting our civil rights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d insists my pet unicorn, Chet. \u201cIt\u2019s totally true!\u201d\n\nBeto, as if that\u2019s his real name, got the fussies because someone from Texas named (of course) Briscoe Cain responded to the Fascist Furry\u2019s threats to send armed people to steal his property by observing that his AR-15 would be ready and waiting. Whether or not this was an appropriate thing to say is not the point, which is why Drinky O\u2019Runfromthescene and his media cheerleaders tried to make it the point. The point is that an awful lot of armed people \u2013 many of them vets \u2013 feel really strongly that sending folks with guns to rip away their Constitutional rights is a tyrannical act of war. And that reality has consequences most Americans are unwilling to accept to bring about the nation of defenseless sheep our alleged betters desire.\n\nThe harsh fact is that when you send people with weapons to steal other people\u2019s stuff there\u2019s a huge potential for violence \u2013 especially if 1) the intended victims strongly (and correctly) believe that they have the Constitutional right to do what they are doing, and because 2) by definition, the people being oppressed have guns. Eric Garner was just trying to peddle some loose cigs and the cops killed him \u2013 when you pass a law you resolve to use force to enforce it, and whenever you use force there\u2019s a risk someone ends up in a body bag. Beto is willing to take that risk. Are you?\n\nOf course, the elite and its media lackeys howl \u201cYOU\u2019RE ADVOCATING VIOLENCE\u201d for even raising the manifestly obvious issue of the violence that would almost certainly result from a frontal assault on an actual provision of the Bill of Rights that actually exists, as opposed to some constitutional specter composed of penumbras, emanations and liberal preferences. It\u2019s a lie, like everything liberals and their gimp media say. You are advocating violence when you propose to used armed force to attack American citizens in order to steal their property and freedom. Beto is advocating violence.\n\nThis is no hypothetical. It\u2019s happened before.\n\nLexington and Concord.\n\nWaco.\n\nRuby Ridge.\n\nSee the trend? When governments try to take Americans\u2019 guns, people die. Maybe scary black guns scare you, but is that danger really what you want to sign on to?\n\nGun confiscation leads to violence \u2013 that\u2019s not a hope but an observation, and an objective fact. Of course, the Democratic transcriptionists that comprise the mainstream media will try to drown out this essential critique of their plot with lies. Just wait for how they mischaracterize this column. They really think their own followers are dumb. It\u2019s them accusing you of having a pro-burn agenda when you suggest they not lay their paws on a hot stove. Ditto the useless Fredocons, who will take a break from their multiple failed marriages, from advocating for wars you get to fight for them, and from bellying up to the Lido Deck buffet for their second breakfast carb download to parrot the party line of their liberal donor dommes. Apparently True Conservatism\u2122 means ignoring inconvenient history if it might make people less likely to accept the preferred policy prescriptions of the tech Ernst Pierre Blofelds out in Silicon Valley stroking your checks.\n\nThe fact remains that the plan to take our guns \u2013 you know, the intention the Democrats kept denying having until The Waco Kid got off message in a play to break the one percent ceiling \u2013 will lead to dead Americans. That\u2019s not a wish. That\u2019s a warning. Beto advocates violence, while we say the violence he would inflict is unacceptable.\n\nSo, the question remains \u2013 a question our much-worse betters most definitely do not want you asking because its answer will make every Normal American less likely to support our garbage elite\u2019s scheme. The question, you furry freak and all you bloodthirsty leftist Venezuelaphiles, is how many Americans are you willing to see die to realize your dream of an America composed of disarmed serfs?\n\nMy answer is, \u201cNone.\u201d I am willing to accept precisely zero Wacos.\n\nBut I bet our elite\u2019s answer is, \u201cAs many as it takes.\u201d\n\nWondering what an America where the bloodthirsty Betos of the left ruled would look like? Check out my action-packed yet hilarious novels, People's Republic, Indian Country and Wildfire. The cruise-shilling grifter contingent called these books \u201cappalling,\u201d which is the best blurb I could ask for for Book IV (coming soon).", "description": "The clownish antics of Tex Kennedy, that drunk driving furry .09/16/2019 1:31:24AM EST.", "authors": ["Kurt", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/7ce64a24-268e-4aae-b1e6-70079a6b628f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
