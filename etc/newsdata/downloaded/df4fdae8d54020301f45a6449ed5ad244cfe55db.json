Event coverage video courtesy CNET/Google.\n\nGoogle has confirmed to ZDNet that its Pixel 4 will not be launching in India.\n\n\"Google has a wide range of products that we make available in different regions around the world. We determine availability based on a variety of factors, including local trends and product features,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\n\"We decided not to make Pixel 4 available in India. We remain committed to our current Pixel phones and look forward to bringing future Pixel devices to India.\"\n\nAt the same time, Pixel users in Japan will be unable to use the phone's Motion Sense feature, which allows users to perform actions without touching the device by waving or swiping a hand in front of the device instead. The Motion Sense feature can be used to change the song playing, or reject a phone call, among other functions.\n\nThe device achieves this by using a radar to sense motion which is then processed by its Soli chip.\n\nAt a launch event in Sydney on Wednesday, Google representatives said Motion Sense is disabled in Japan currently due to regulatory concerns. Even an overseas purchased Pixel 4 device will disable the feature when it recognises it is in Japan, the representative added.\n\nWhile the phone in the United States is said to arrive without any headphones or a 3.5mm headphone adapter, boxes sold in Australia will have headphones, Google confirmed to ZDNet.\n\nZDNet has asked what is contained in Pixel 4 boxes throughout Asia-Pacific.\n\nGoogle officially launched its pair of Pixel 4 phones on Tuesday, after months of leaks.\n\nBoth phones run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 with a Pixel Neural Core chip, have 6GB of memory, and storage options of 64GB and 128GB.\n\nThe difference between the Pixel 4 and the Pixel 4 XL is in the screen and battery specs. The smaller Pixel 4 has a 2,800mAh battery, and a 5.7-inch OLED display, while the bigger Pixel 4 XL has a 3,700mAh battery and a 6.3-inch display.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nWhere Google's Pixel 4 and Apple's iPhone 11 fail\n\nHey, smartphone makers, wake up!\n\nPixel 4 specs vs price: Google's new phone is too weak, too late, and too expensive\n\nIs the Pixel 4 an overpriced disappointment when compared with rival devices from Apple and Samsung?\n\nPixel 4 vs iPhone 11: tech specs compared\n\nNow that Apple and Google have both unveiled their flagship smartphones, let's take a tour of the tech specs and see how they stack up against each other.\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 available in Singapore from October 24\n\nPriced from SG$1,119, the latest Pixel range can be purchased directly from Google or local telco StarHub, as well as at electronic retail chains Challenger and Courts from October 24, with pre-orders now open to customers.\n\nGoogle Pixel 4: Cheat sheet (TechRepublic)\n\nRead about the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL's features, specs, price, and all of the most important details that professionals need to know about these Google smartphones.\n\nGoogle Pixel 4 features that business users will need (TechRepublic)\n\nHere's what business users can expect from Google's latest smartphone that was announced on October 15.", "description": "Country by country decisions throughout the Asia-Pacific region means a Pixel 4 in some places is not the same Pixel 4 in others, even if it is the same phone.", "authors": ["Chris Duckett"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/15/42b8b6d9-0c7e-494a-898c-4e449ac7e3de/thumbnail/770x578/0a20739d685f3d75867858e0c8007f97/fdde9226-a0c8-411c-ac18-17698c356219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
