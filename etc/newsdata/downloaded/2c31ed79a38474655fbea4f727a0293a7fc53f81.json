For this week, it is the Packers-Raiders game.\n\nTo mark each Game of the Week, the AP will be reprinting its story of a classic matchup in the rivalry. The following is the story from the 2003 meeting between the teams on the day after Brett Favre\u2019s father passed away, first published on Dec. 23, 2003, and written by AP Sports Writer Greg Beacham.\n\nFavre deals with grief by playing heavy heart out\n\nBy GREG BEACHAM\n\nAP Sports Writer\n\nOAKLAND (AP) - Brett Favre dealt with the grief in the best way he could imagine.\n\nHe played his heavy heart out.\n\nFavre passed for 399 yards and four touchdowns a day after his father\u2019s death, moving into second place in NFL history for career TD passes while leading the Green Bay Packers to a 41-7 victory over the Oakland Raiders on Monday night.\n\nWith one spectacular long pass after another, Favre decimated the Raiders\u2019 patchwork defense with one of the greatest performances in his 13-year career. He finished just 3 yards shy of his career high while sending the Raiders to their worst loss in eight years.\n\nFavre threw for a personal-best 311 yards and four TDs in the first half, quickly turning a crucial game for the Packers\u2019 playoff hopes into a blowout victory - and he did it on one of the saddest days of his life.\n\nIrvin Favre died of a heart attack Sunday night while driving near his son\u2019s hometown of Kiln, Mississippi. Brett decided to stay with the Packers (9-6) long enough to lead a victory that kept them in a tie with Minnesota atop the NFC North.\n\nFavre went 22 of 30, smiling and hugging his teammates throughout the game. In the fourth quarter, he embraced his wife, Deanna, before they headed home to Mississippi.\n\nThough the formula is complicated, Green Bay can all but clinch a playoff berth with a victory over Denver on Sunday - and if the Vikings lose to Arizona, the Packers will win their second straight division title. The Packers also will be in the playoffs if Seattle loses to San Francisco on Saturday.\n\nWith the first of two first-half scoring passes to Javon Walker, Favre passed Fran Tarkenton on the NFL\u2019s career list with his 343rd career TD throw. The three-time MVP finished with 345, trailing only Dan Marino\u2019s 420.\n\nFavre got a respectful ovation from the normally vicious Raider Nation when he was announced as a starter in his 205th consecutive game, an NFL record for quarterbacks. He might have been drowning in emotion, but his performance was almost amazingly poised - and his receiving corps was just as impressive against the befuddled Raiders (4-11).\n\nOn the Packers\u2019 fourth play from scrimmage, Favre threw a breathtaking 47-yard completion to Robert Ferguson - a high-arching ball that traveled at least 55 yards in the air, the kind of throw that only a handful of quarterbacks have ever mastered.\n\nOne play later, tight end Wesley Walls leaped for a 22-yard score in the back of the end zone. Favre jumped into Walls\u2019 arms for a lengthy hug.\n\nFavre completed his first nine passes, including a perfect 23-yard TD pass down the Packers\u2019 sideline to Walker, before throwing an intentional incompletion out of the end zone. He then completed his next three, hitting Walker again when the receiver outmuscled two Oakland defenders for a 43-yard TD catch.\n\nMany of Favre\u2019s throws were into coverage, but the Raiders\u2019 secondary allowed repeated catches: seven of at least 20 yards. Favre capped the half with a 46-yard pass to Walker and a 6-yard TD to David Martin with a minute left.\n\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, Favre\u2019s 311 yards passing were the most in a first half in his career and the most in any first half since Peyton Manning had 324 for Indianapolis on Sept. 23, 2001.\n\nCharlie Garner made a spinning 25-yard TD run in the first quarter, but Oakland\u2019s offense had no chance to keep up with Favre and his receivers. The Raiders will finish their hugely disappointing campaign Sunday in San Diego, where they lost the Super Bowl last season.\n\nFavre\u2019s receivers beat Oakland cornerback Phillip Buchanon for three of the first-half scores, and Buchanon was benched in the second half. So was quarterback Rick Mirer, who went 12 of 23 for 114 yards before Rob Johnson took over late in the third quarter.\n\nGreen Bay defensive lineman Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila had three sacks, giving him 10 for the season to become the first player in franchise history with at least 10 in three straight seasons. Gbaja-Biamila\u2019s brother, Akbar, plays for the Raiders, and two more of their brothers were in attendance at the Coliseum.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As part of its celebration of its 100th season, the NFL is designating a Game of the Week, each chosen to highlight a classic matchup.
