Even his Republican sycophants are furious that he would do this to our allies.\u201d\n\nIn other news Wednesday, former vice-president and Democratic candidate Joe Biden explicitly called for Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cJoe Biden let the world know that if you come after his family, he will wait three weeks, formulate a response, and then he will come after you with guns a-blazin,\u2019\u201d said Kimmel.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a \u201cweird\u201d place for the country to be, where \u201cpoliticians have to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment\u201d, Kimmel continued. \u201cHe\u2019s drawing in Sharpie on weather maps, he\u2019s extorting our allies, he\u2019s in bed with Putin, he\u2019s obstructing Congress \u2013 calling for him to be impeached, it\u2019s like if there was a rat sitting in the middle of your pizza and you call for it to be removed.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nOn the Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed Trump\u2019s penchant for damaging phone calls, from the one with Zelenskiy to his call with Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that preceded US withdrawal from northern Syria. \u201cIn the end, Trump may be defeated by his greatest weakness: his Achilles mouth,\u201d said Colbert. The spiral is \u201call detailed in the epic poem: the Idiod.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just the tip of the dumb-berg,\u201d Colbert continued. Trump\u2019s phone calls with foreign aides have long worried aides, leaving them \u201cgenuinely horrified\u201d, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cSo, these aides were horrified, but they\u2019re just telling us now?\u201d Colbert marveled. \u201cWell it\u2019s like the signs say, if you see something, say something two years after we could do anything about it.\u201d The report characterized one call with Vladimir Putin as \u201cobsequious and fawning\u201d, and revealed another with Chinese President Xi Jinping in which he incessantly discussed chocolate cake.\n\nOne former aide said that during the Obama years, preparation for the calls was taken seriously; under Trump, \u201cit appears to be freestyle and ad-libbed\u201d. Trump is making it up as he goes \u2013 \u201cbasically doing diplomacy like an improv team,\u201d said Colbert, imitating the process: \u201cI\u2019m about to call a foreign leader \u2013 I need a suggestion of a country and something to tariff. Anybody? I heard Switzerland and cuckoo clocks.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers\n\nOn Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at the Trump administration\u2019s continued stonewalling of the House impeachment inquiry. The inquiry isn\u2019t just an investigation into President Trump, Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a test of our system in which Congress is supposed to be a co-equal branch of the government. And yesterday, the Trump administration did its best to undermine that system by declaring itself above the law.\u201d\n\nTrump submitted a scathing letter to Congress in which he questioned the constitutionality of impeachment and refused to comply with the investigation. \u201cThat\u2019s right, President Trump is calling impeachment \u2013 a process which is laid out in the constitution \u2013 unconstitutional,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be so shocked if he ever reads the constitution one day.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on Fox News, a Trump ally told host Jeanine Pirro that in order to stall impeachment, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell should just change the Senate rules so they\u2019re not required to hold an impeachment trial, regardless of the House investigation\u2019s outcome.\n\n\u201cThey literally want to change the rules because they\u2019re losing,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if the Jets were down 45-0 at halftime and said: we want to change the rules to let running backs have SUVs.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts examined the Trump administration\u2019s stonewalling and Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c560caec727823c859e3fb79b056aa8d478c10ef/109_0_1478_887/master/1478.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df662c042e2e73a5080dc74ab781a11e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
