Here\u2019s the tiny hack, as discussed on Reddit a few days ago: When you\u2019re looking for free software around the web, resist the urge to Google (or your search engine of choice) the word \u201cfree.\u201d\n\nWhy\u2019s that? Because when you say you\u2019re looking for, oh, a free photoshop alternative, you\u2019re bound to get a pile of crap as a result: Freeware apps that aren\u2019t actually free, subscription apps that come with a free trial, or other variants that cost you absolutely nothing to use for as long as you want.\n\nAs one Redditor noted:\n\n\u201cThis literally just happened to me. Found a \u2018free\u2019 resume building site. Spent an hour building it and when I got to the end, you had to pay for a trial to even download it.\u201d\n\nInstead what you want to search for is \u201copen-source\u201d plus the general topic of whatever app or service you\u2019re trying to find. This won\u2019t always net you an app that costs you nothing, but you\u2019re likely to have better luck.\n\nYou can also search for \u201calternative to\u201d a conventional app that does something you don\u2019t want to have to pay for (or check out the similarly named website).\n\nIf you want, you can try my favourite search: \u201c[app name] alternatives site:reddit.com,\u201d which is bound to net you some great recommendations (if you don\u2019t mind mucking through comments).", "description": "Props to Lifehacker\u2019s own Nick Douglas for stumbling across this one \u2014 something I\u2019ve always known, but didn\u2019t realise I should articulate to the world.
