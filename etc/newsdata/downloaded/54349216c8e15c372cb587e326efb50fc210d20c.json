But they\u2019re not his contemporaries \u2013 instead Heredero, 75, shares his Madrid home with two refugees. \u201cThe three of us are delighted,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter raising seven children and subsequently living in a mostly empty home, Heredero connected with an organisation which places asylum seekers looking for places to live with people who are willing to open their homes. He\u2019s now sharing his space with refugees from Syria and Senegal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like a family,\u201d says Rabee Aitizeeny, who lives with Heredero. Originally from Syria, he is now studying Spanish every day and getting to know the local community of Pinto (even learning to cook an authentic Spanish paella). \u201cC\u00e9sar is like a father to me.\u201d\n\nHeredero agrees. \u201cMy routine before was very boring. Now it\u2019s the normal liveliness of a house. And this is something I like.\u201d", "description": "Have extra space in your house?
