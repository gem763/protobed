She has been calling them many times. There is a lot of damp because the home is not maintained properly.\n\n\u201cCody\u2019s have done nothing. They just want to take the money and if there are any problems they just don\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of damp everywhere, lots of problems with heating over winter and many more faults need repair and the agency do nothing.\u201d\n\n(Image: Richard Addison/Hull Live)\n\nBad weather in recent weeks has only made the conditions in the house worse, with heavy rain creating a leak in the roof.\n\nMr Kochalski claims that a maintenance call left even more damage too.\n\n\u201cDue to intensive rain her roof badly leaked. It was leaking in the past but it was ignored by the Cody\u2019s staff,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAfter a few attempts Alicja managed to get someone to have a look.\n\n\u201cThe maintenance guy came on Monday and went into the attic to check out what was going on. All her second floor was flooded due to all night dripping water from the ceiling.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, this guy fell through her ceiling making a huge dripping and cold blowing hole.\n\n(Image: Richard Addison/Hull Live)\n\n\u201cHe just tried to cover it up and said it is perfectly safe and then he disappeared.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife and Alicja went to the agency straight away and they said they can\u2019t do anything with it and that it is not up to them.\n\n\u201cThey said they were going to ring the police because my wife was quite loud.\u201d\n\n(Image: Richard Addison/Hull Live)\n\nA spokesperson for Codys says that the agency acted as soon as they were made aware of the leak in the roof, and even appointed a Loss Adjuster after instructions from the private landlord.\n\nThey said: \u201cFirst and foremost, this property is not owned by Codys it is owned by a private landlord who is currently very ill in hospital and who has been ill for some time.\n\n\u201cCodys received an email on Sunday, September 29, to advise that there was a bad leak through the roof at the property. Our offices are closed at that time on a Sunday evening and as we are all aware we have had a spell of prolonged rain.\n\n\u201cThe Codys staff responded at 9.13am on Monday, September 30, by email and a workman was sent within an hour.\n\n(Image: Sarah Washbourn)\n\n\u201cThe workman identified that a section of the ceiling was about to fall down so out of concern for the tenants, he made the section safe.\n\n\u201cHe could see the leak from inside the loft and tried to stem the flow from the inside, but as it was raining heavily at the time, it was too dangerous to go onto the roof.\n\n\u201cHe spent approximately two hours at the property and came back to the office to advise that urgent further works were required and that in his opinion it should be an insured loss.\n\n\u201cBy the time the workman had got to the office, the tenant and her representative had also arrived at Codys office and proceeded to threaten, abuse and swear at the Codys staff, in perfect English although the tenant professes not to be able to speak English.\n\n\u201cThe tenant has been advised of the progress but has continued to be rude and threatening to the Codys staff and I am now very concerned that there is a health and safety issue for the safety of the Codys staff when visiting the property moving forward.\n\n\u201cIf the Loss adjuster feels that temporary accommodation is required then he will authorise that.\n\n\u201cWhile this situation is far from ideal, if the tenant feels that the safety of her children is at risk then it is her responsibility to take them away from that risk and any expenses should be reimbursed if the Loss Adjuster agrees with her.\n\n\u201cThe Landlord has asked the insurer about temporary accommodation and they have said that they cannot authorise that until the Loss Adjuster can attend.\n\n\u201cCodys staff cannot do anything further and they are not to blame for an unforeseen incident, they have acted swiftly and do not deserve to be vilified in this way.\u201d\n\nAlicja claims that all this is affecting her three children, aged between nine and fifteen.\n\nHer brother-in-law added: \u201cAlicja\u2019s youngest daughter is sleeping with her mum all the time. They all sleep in the one room.\n\n\u201cObviously it is quite disturbing for them having to get into the one place because it is very cold.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t go upstairs. The young one, Lara, she is scared because someone came in through the hole and now she does not want to go up there.\n\n(Image: Facebook/Jakub Kochalski)\n\n\u201cEverything is wet up there and there is a lot of water on the ceiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlicja is very upset. She is crying every morning.\n\n\u201cShe comes to our house just to make herself feel warm.\n\n\u201cI am feeling awful. This is not supposed to be happening. It is unacceptable from the agency.", "description": "Alicja Kochalska's family claim they huddle together in single room because of the cold - but letting agents say 'we've done all we can'", "authors": ["Joshua Minchin", "Michael Mutch", "Image", "Richard Addison Hull Live", "Sarah Washbourn", "Facebook Jakub Kochalski"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465461.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Alicja-Kochalska.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
