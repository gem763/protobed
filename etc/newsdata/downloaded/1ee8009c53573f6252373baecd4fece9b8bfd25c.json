Not Halbussi, not Abdel Mahdi. We want to bring down the regime,\u201d the protester said.\n\nWomen were also seen in larger numbers, including a young nurse who said she was protesting \u201cfor the generation that\u2019s coming\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur generation is psychologically tired, but it\u2019s alright as long as this is for the next one,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 Curfews, arrests \u2013\n\nRenewed protests also flooded the streets of Najaf, Hilla, Karbala and Diwaniyah in the south.\n\nIn the oil-rich port city of Basra, police enforced a strict curfew and said it arrested \u201csaboteurs\u201d who had infiltrated the protesters.\n\nThis week\u2019s demonstrations are the sequel to six days of anti-government rallies that erupted October 1.\n\nSparked by outrage at corruption, unemployment and poor services, they evolved into demands for an overhaul of the political system and a new constitution.\n\nOn Saturday, Iraqi President Barham Saleh met with the United Nations\u2019 top representative in the country Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert to discuss electoral reform and amendments to the constitution, which dates back to 2005.\n\nAbdel Mahdi has also proposed a laundry list of reforms including hiring drives, increased pensions and promises to root out corruption.\n\nOil-rich Iraq is the OPEC oil cartel\u2019s second biggest producer, but one in five people live in poverty and youth unemployment stands at 25 percent, according to the World Bank.\n\nBeyond the street, Abdel Mahdi also faces new pressure from parliament, whose largest bloc has been holding an open-ended sit-in since Saturday night to back the rallies.\n\n\u201cThe sit-in is ongoing and open until protester demands are met and the reforms promised by the PM are enacted,\u201d said MP Salam al-Hadi, a member of Saeroon \u2014 an alliance between populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iraq\u2019s Communist Party.\n\nThe move has left Abdel Mahdi more squeezed than ever, as Saeroon was one of the two main sponsors of his government.\n\n\u2013 Elite troops deploy \u2013\n\nThe other was Fatah, the political arm of the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force which said it would continue to back the central government.\n\nThe one-time allies now find themselves on opposite sides of the protest movement.\n\nThe Hashed was founded in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group but its factions have since been ordered to incorporate into state security services.\n\nSeveral of their offices have been torched in recent days in southern Iraqi cities, hinting at a new violent phase.\n\nDozens of protesters have died while storming or setting fire to the offices of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, the Badr Organisation and others, according to medics and police.\n\nHashed commanders have threatened revenge, and its second-in-command Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis said Sunday his force \u201cis ready to stand against discord\u201d.\n\nThe UN has warned \u201carmed spoilers\u201d could derail efforts at peaceful protests in Iraq, saying it was \u201ctragic\u201d to see renewed violence in the country.\n\nA government probe found \u201cexcessive force\u201d was used to quell the first week of protests and in a noticeable change, there have been no reports of live ammunition in Baghdad in recent days.\n\nMost of those killed since Thursday have been shot in the Shiite-majority south, but medics and protesters in the capital have reported trauma wounds from tear gas canisters.\n\nOn Sunday, security forces were positioned on the edges of Tahrir, while elite Counter-Terrorism Service troops and armoured vehicles were seen in surrounding districts.\n\nThe CTS said it had deployed its units to \u201cprotect vital infrastructure,\u201d and its forces were not seen in Tahrir.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Iraqi students joined anti-government protests in Baghdad on Sunday, ramping up the street pressure on Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Iraq-protest-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
