Many people take out a loan to cover the initial cost\n\nWhen making our pick of the loans around we don\u2019t just take the best rates from the comparison tables \u2013 we also scour the market for all-around winners.\n\nFirst things first...are you trying to cut existing credit card debt?\n\nIf so, a loan probably won't be the absolute cheapest option for you - as long as you do not have a large amount of debt and can try to clear it relatively quickly.\n\nThe whole point of balance transfer deals on credit cards are to shift card debts to them at a special cheap rate.\n\nThese rates will almost certainly be cheaper than loans for less than \u00a31,000.\n\nAnd for larger amounts they can still prove more cost effective.\n\nProviding you can transfer to a credit card, and will definitely pay it off before the 0 per cent deal ends, a balance transfer can prove the cheapest option.\n\nIf you can't, you would need to make sure you transfer your balance to another 0 per cent deal, or you will face high interest charges.\n\nIf you don't have the financial firepower or discipline to clear the debt within a 0 per cent balance transfer period then a loan may be the best move. It sets monthly payments and as long as you keep up with them over the course of the loan, you will end up with that debt cleared.\n\n> Use our guide to find the best 0 per cent transfer credit card for you.\n\nWhat effect will your credit rating have?\n\nTerms and conditions apply on all these loans, particularly on how long you borrow for, and rates you are offered will vary depending on your credit history.\n\nWhen you take out a personal loan, as with any borrowing agreement the lender will run a credit check.\n\nThe top rates will of course invite the most loan applications, meaning banks have the pick of the bunch when it comes to who they accept.\n\nIn addition, there are also rules in place that mean that only 51 per cent of borrowers must be offered the rates lenders advertise on their loans for them to do so.\n\nThis means that even if you do get accepted for a loan you may be offered a more expensive rate.\n\nThere are some comparison sites and individual lenders that will run a soft-search first before you officially apply. These won't leave a mark on your credit file and they could give you a better idea of whether you will be accepted, and what rate you could be offered first.\n\nWorried your credit score isn't up to scratch? Consider a soft search tool first\n\nBest buy loan rates at different levels\n\nLoans up to \u00a35,000\n\nZopa and charges the lowest rate at 7.7 per cent on amounts between \u00a33,000-\u00a34,999 on a term of up to five years.\n\nHitachi Personal Finance offer the next cheapest deal at 9.5 per cent on the same bracket. It offers repayment windows of between two and five years.\n\nThe AA offers a rate of 9.9 per cent on amounts on between \u00a33,000 and \u00a35,000 to both members and non members.\n\nCAN I REPAY MY LOAN EARLY? If you are able to repay your loan early or you want to pay off some of it, lenders will let you. However you will have to pay a penalty - there is no set amount but this is usually around one or two months worth of interest, calculated on the remaining amount you owe. This means that the earlier you repay during the life or term of the loan, the higher the interest charge will be.\n\nLoans for \u00a35,000 to \u00a37,499\n\nThe lowest rate currently available on this bracket is offered by Clydesdale Bank at 3.4 per cent on amounts between \u00a35,000 and \u00a37,499 lasting up to five years.\n\nNext is peer-to-peer lender Zopa charging slightly more at 3.5 per cent, you can repay over a two to five year term.\n\nM&S Bank comes in third, charging a rate of 3.6 per cent but it also has the benefit of loan terms of up to seven years. M&S offers the rate on a term of up to seven years - the longest available.\n\nOpen a Nectar card to get a better rate Sainsbury\u2019s Nectar cardholders are also offered a price promise guarantee that states that if you can get a better deal elsewhere, it will beat it by 0.1 per cent. To qualify, successful applicants must provide a written offer from the other lender in the same name as the loan offered by Sainsbury's within 28 days of the Sainsbury's Standard Loan being approved. You must not have accepted the standard loan offer by signing and returning the Sainsbury's Loan agreement. The loans must be compared on a like-for-like basis. However, bear in mind that multiple credit searches impact your credit footprint - if you do sign up to this deal you will have effective applied for two loans.\n\nHitachi Personal Finance follow just behind at 3.7 per cent.\n\nLoans for \u00a37,500 to \u00a315,000\n\nLenders typically offer the best rates to those borrowing between \u00a37,500 and \u00a315,000 as this is the bracket most banks typically advertise.\n\nThere are a handful of banks charging 2.8 per cent, including Sainsbury's Bank, Santander-owned Cahoot (up to \u00a320,000) and M&S Bank.\n\nSainsbury's Bank offers the rate only to those with its Nectar loyalty card, offering up to five years. If not you will pay 3.7 per cent.\n\nM&S Bank charges the same rate on up to \u00a315,000 again it has the advantage of a repayment window of up to seven years.\n\nLewis Finance and both Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks also sit at 2.9 per cent (up to \u00a315,000) repaid over one to five years.\n\nLoans of more than \u00a315,000\n\nIf you need to take out a loan for more than \u00a315,000 there are several options.\n\nSeveral banks have now started extend the typical \u00a37,500 - \u00a315,000 loan bracket to \u00a320,000 or \u00a325,000, meaning the same market-beating rates on slightly larger amounts.\n\nAs listed above, Cahoot lends at the same price on up to \u00a320,000.\n\nFirst Direct 1st Account customers can grab a rate of 3.3 per cent on up to \u00a330,000 over a repayment term of up to seven years.\n\nAnyone with a Tesco Clubcard can take out a loan of between \u00a315,001 and \u00a325,000 for 3 per cent repaying over a term lasting up to five years.\n\nYou can get the same loan for 3.1 per cent over six or seven years, the rate jumps to 5.3 per cent for eight, nine or ten year terms.\n\nBorrow up to \u00a350,000.\n\nHSBC-owned bank, First Direct, charges a headline rate of 6.7 per cent on amounts between \u00a330,000 and \u00a350,000 with repayment terms of between 12 and 84 months. The loan is only available to customers with a First Account.\n\nSainsbury's Bank offers up to \u00a340,000 with a rate of 7.6 per cent for someone needing three years to repay.\n\nNatwest applies interest at 6.9 per cent on amounts between \u00a325,000 and \u00a350,000 offering terms of up to eight years if it's for home improvements.\n\nHalifax charges 5.8 per cent on amounts between \u00a325,000 and \u00a335,000 and 6.8 per cent on up to \u00a350,000 with a repayment term of between one and seven years.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Looking to take out a loan?
