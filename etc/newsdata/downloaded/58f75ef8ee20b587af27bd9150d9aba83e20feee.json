Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for\n\nthe damage, but the U.S. has pointed the finger directly at\n\nIran. The Canadian dollar CAD=D3 rose 0.4% to 1.3233 per dollar.\n\nThe Norwegian krone rose 0.5% to 8.9363 per dollar. Both\n\ncurrencies often move together with the oil price because the\n\ncountries are major oil exporters.\n\nIn India, a major importer of crude, the rupee fell\n\nalmost 0.7%.\n\n\"The natural flow through of higher (oil) prices has seen\n\nthe NOK and the CAD outperform, and we'll probable see a better\n\nfeel towards the (Russian) rouble later on,\" said Chris Weston,\n\nhead of research at brokerage Pepperstone Group in Melbourne.\n\nThe attacks reversed last week's ebullient risk appetite and\n\nprompted U.S. President Donald Trump to tweet that the United\n\nStates was \"locked and loaded\" for a response.\n\n\"We've got a beady eye on this and we're prepared to pile\n\nback in to the Japanese yen after last week's repositioning,\"\n\nWeston said, adding that while trade was calm, the strikes\n\npresented another geopolitical \"what if\" to vex markets.\n\nThe safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc both firmed. The\n\nyen JPY=EBS rose 0.3% to 107.79 per dollar and the franc rose\n\n0.4% to $0.9883. Gold jumped by 1%.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the dollar edged lower\n\nto 98.162.\n\nBeyond oil, currency markets are awaiting the outcome of\n\ncentral bank meetings in the U.S. and Japan this week and\n\neconomic data in Australia and New Zealand that could determine\n\nthe rates outlook in the Antipodes.\n\n\"Geopolitical risks and central bank rhetoric remain key\n\ndrivers of risk this week,\" Australia and New Zealand Banking\n\nGroup analysts said in a note.\n\nOn the Brexit front, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's\n\nconfidence of sealing a deal to leave the European Union by Oct.\n\n31 applied renewed pressure to the pound. Sterling GBP=D3 fell 0.3 from a seven-week high to hit\n\n$1.2486.\n\nWhile much of the risk appetite on display last week was\n\ndriven by signs of a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions, few\n\nfresh indications of progress left sentiment fragile.\n\nData released on Monday showed the slowdown in China's\n\neconomy deepened in August, with industrial production growing\n\nat its weakest pace in 17-1/2 years and retail sales weaker than\n\nanticipated.\n\nThat added to pressure for stimulus and in offshore trade\n\nthe Chinese yuan CNH= weakened 0.25% to 7.0631 per dollar.\n\nIn the United States, investors who had begun trimming\n\nexpectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut on Wednesday\n\nare now certain rates will fall and divided only over how much.\n\nFEDWATCH\n\nAs for the Bank of Japan's policy decision on Thursday, a\n\nthird of economists polled by Reuters expect stimulus to be\n\nramped up. But sources say it may be a close call as\n\npolicymakers wait till the last minute to assess market reaction\n\nto the Fed's decision hours earlier. Japanese markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday.\n\nThe euro EUR=D3 was steady at $1.1073.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Dollar falls, oil-exporter currencies rise after Saudi attacks; yen firms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/forex_800x533_L_1411902780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
