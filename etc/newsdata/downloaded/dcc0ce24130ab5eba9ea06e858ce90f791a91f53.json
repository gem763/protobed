While not necessarily an illegal act, it does run counter to an executive order signed by President Obama in 2009 that says information can\u2019t be classified to \u201cconceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error\u201d or \u201cprevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency,\u201d they said.\n\nPOLITICO first reported last week that the White House began to use the codeword system to restrict the number of officials who had access to these transcripts following leaks in 2017.\n\nAs part of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, lawmakers are interested in learning who was involved in uploading the call records to that system\u2014a stark departure from how the system is typically used and how memos of the president\u2019s exchanges have traditionally been handled, former officials and experts said.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nThe basic concept of logging who went in and out of ultrasecret NSC-wide systems is not unique to the Trump administration, according to three former National Security Council officials.\n\nOne of those officials with direct knowledge of the system also said the ability to log who accessed specific documents in the codeword system \u201cseems consistent with some of the controls in place\u201d on the system under President Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to further tighten controls on the information,\u201d the former official said.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a senior administration official said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to discuss how we handle classified materials.\u201d\n\nBut the administration\u2019s external supporters have defended the move. Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, speaking on Fox News Tuesday morning, said, \u201cI think they were acting responsibly. We have to protect our relationships. We have to be able to communicate with our allies and partners. The president should be able to do that without those classified conversations and exchange maybe of national security information being leaked to the press.\u201d\n\nWhile only a certain number of NSC staffers have the codeword system installed on their workstations, only a subset of those staffers, in turn, has access to specific documents on that system. The former official with knowledge of the system added that he had never seen transcripts put on that codeword system during his time in the Obama administration.\n\nThe changes came months after entire transcripts of President Trump\u2019s calls with the leaders of Australia and Mexico were leaked to the Washington Post, setting off a furious internal search for the source of the unauthorized disclosures and widening the mistrust between the president and his own staff.\n\nBefore the upgrade, the White House began restricting the distribution of the transcripts of the president\u2019s calls with foreign leaders to a narrower group of officials. Previously, the transcripts had been put on a shared drive that all NSC staffers had access to, which made it easier for leaks to happen, according to a former Trump White House official.\n\nOfficials in the NSC\u2019s intelligence directorate had to take the matter up to the principals level because \u201cit was a pretty fundamental change to the system.\u201d John Kelly and H.R. McMaster, the respective chief of staff and national security adviser at the time, signed off on the change.\n\nA former White House official said the upgrade came amid \"a hard look at who had a 'need to know', which is fundamental to managing classified info and highly sensitive documents, conversations, emails, etc.\" This former official characterized the changes as the White House merely adopting the standard classification practices used at the Pentagon and intelligence agencies.\n\nStill, intelligence and national security experts called it \u201chighly unusual\u201d for these kinds of routine calls between world leaders to be placed into a system that\u2019s intended to be used only for information about the nation\u2019s most highly compartmented programs -- for instance, covert actions like the secret raid in Pakistan that led to the assassination of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

The person who most likely put the transcript into NICE would have been one of the NSC staffers responsibility for maintaining this highly compartmentalized system for intelligence storage at the NSC.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no one else who would have been trusted to do it,\u201d said the former official.\n\nPeople who likely had access to the Ukraine call transcript included people like the NSC\u2019s Ukraine country director, the senior director for Europe and Russia, a number of people from the legal office, a couple of West Wing staffers, the staff secretary and several others in the Situation Room, this person said.\n\nCNN and the New York Times reported that transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi leader Mohammed Bin Salman were also placed into that highly classified system to prevent them from being leaked.\n\nThe Russian calls \u201cwere pretty much what you would expect, you can take the first part of the Zelensky call with all of the over the top effusive praise and basically copy and paste onto pretty much any head of state call with Trump, whether it was Emmanuel Macron or Vladimir Putin,\u201d said the former NSC official. \u201cEvery one of them knew to start the call by praising him for the thing that he had just done that week.\u201d\n\nOn his calls with Putin, most of the time Trump talked about wanting to put the relationship between the U.S. and Russia on a friendlier footing, but complained that the media and other people in the government were preventing him from doing so.\n\n\u201cThey were certainly the type of thing that you would not want in public because they were just really embarrassing from the standpoint of just national pride,\u201d said the official.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fc/09/31a5f7444c2a9c88eaa843cb8b1c/20191001-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
