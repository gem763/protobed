Watch him paddle it across a pond", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nAfter a Tennessee farmer grew a nearly 1,000-pound pumpkin, he dug out the seeds and climbed in.\n\nJustin Ownby had broken his own personal record by growing a pumpkin that weighed 910 pounds and then celebrated his achievement by turning it into a boat, according to photos and videos his wife, Christin, posted on Facebook.\n\nThe farmer from Cleveland, Tennessee, had been attempting to grow a 1,000-pound pumpkin for the past four years but this year had a secret weapon that brought him closer to his goal, his wife told CNN.\n\nHis secret weapon was a pumpkin seed taken from another enormous pumpkin grown in the state that weighed more than 1,700 pounds. Ownby planted the seed in May and watched as his prized pumpkin grew.\n\n\u201cHe chose a pot where the water ran off easily, keeping it cool in the heat of the day, keeping it watered and making sure that the squash beetles didn\u2019t overtake it,\u201d Christin told local Chattanooga station WTVC.\n\nAfter the pumpkin was hauled onto a trailer and weighed, Ownby hollowed it out and harvested the seeds, according to CNN. Then on Monday night, he plunged the \"Great Pumpkin\" into the pond, climbed inside and began paddling around.\n\nChristin posted his little adventure on Facebook and even captured the moment he fell off. She told WTVC that the last time she checked, the pumpkin was still floating in the pond.\n\nThe idea wasn\u2019t totally original, as the \"500lb Pumpkin Boat Race\" is hosted every year in Morton, Illinois.\n\nChristin told CNN that their pumpkin would have placed second at the local fair but that they were unable to attend because of a family trip. However, that won\u2019t stop her husband from trying again.\n\n\u201cHe is hoping to break the 1,000-pound mark next year,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/23/tennessee-mans-grows-giant-great-pumpkin-converts-into-boat/4069409002/", "description": "A farmer from Cleveland, Tennessee grew a nearly 1,000-pound pumpkin and decided to celebrate his accomplishment in a very unique way.", "authors": ["Adrianna Rodriguez", "Published A.M.
