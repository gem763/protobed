Some set up flaming barricades in the streets, torching cars and trash cans. They chanted, \u201cThe streets will always be ours!\u201d\n\nCatalan police said protesters threw gasoline bombs, stones, bottles and firecrackers at them.\n\nViolence erupted in Catalonia after Spain\u2019s Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine separatist Catalan leaders to up to 13 years in prison for their part in an October 2017 effort to declare independence for the region.\n\nAfter a surge in separatist sentiment since the global economic crisis that hit Spain particularly hard, around half of Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million residents want to break away from Spain and forge a new European country. The divisive issue has divided families and friends, but demonstrations had largely been peaceful until this week.\n\nOutnumbered police used riot helmets, vests and shields for protection. They fired foam bullets and swung batons to keep away the swarming radicals, most of who covered their faces. Police also drove armored vans at high speeds to scatter the crowds.\n\nWhen police succeeded in dispersing one hot spot, another erupted.\n\nOne police helicopter was hit by five \u201cpyrotechnic\u201d objects similar to fireworks, according to the regional police force. The rare passers-by or tourists caught in the middle of the melees scurried to safety. Some residents tossed water from balconies down on burning trash bins and debris while firefighters tried to keep up with the emergencies.\n\nCentral Barcelona, a leading tourist destination known for its beautiful architecture and relaxed atmosphere, became a no-go territory.\n\n\u201c(This is) shameful. It doesn\u2019t represent me,\u201d architect Gerard Beltri said. \u201cI think the verdict was very bad, but I think this (violence) is by a minority of the independence movement. The real independence movement is not like this. These people only want to do damage and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nHealth services in Catalonia said medics attended to 52 people in the region Wednesday. Police said late Wednesday that they had arrested \u201cat least 20 people\u201d throughout Catalonia for violent acts.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the violent clashes wouldn\u2019t provoke him into taking drastic measures in Catalonia, despite calls by rival parties to crack down on the separatist politicians in power in the region.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, who is an interim prime minister while awaiting national elections Nov. 10, consulted with other national political leaders in Madrid during the day about the trouble in Catalonia.\n\nThe Spanish government will respond with \u201cfirmness, calmness and unity\u201d to the confrontations, S\u00e1nchez said in a televised address.\n\nS\u00e1nchez blamed \u201corganized groups of extremists\u201d for the rioting but said he wouldn\u2019t be drawn into playing their game of an \u201cascending spiral of violence.\u201d\n\nThe protests followed the pattern of previous days as crowds gathered during the day to block roads and hold marches demanding independence. After sunset, marches turned ugly.\n\nPolice also reported clashes in Girona, a town near the French border, and other places.\n\nThe clashes have injured more than 250 people, including police, over the past three days. On Monday police skirmished for hours to keep protesters from entering the Barcelona airport and shutting it down.\n\nAn organization representing Barcelona businesses, called Barcelona Abierta, said the violence had caused \u201csignificant losses\u201d and \u201cdeeply damaged\u201d its image abroad. Tourism is vital to the city\u2019s economy.\n\nPere Ferrer, director of Catalonia\u2019s regional police, said the street violence was \u201cintolerable.\u201d\n\nOther protests are scheduled in the coming days as separatists vow no letup in their secession drive.\n\nMost impromptu protesters have responded to an online campaign by Tsunami Democratic, a shadowy grassroots group that uses encrypted messaging apps to call for peaceful disobedience.\n\nSpanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Cadena SER radio that authorities were investigating the group and \u201cclose to\u201d discovering who is behind it.\n\nOn Wednesday, the group issued a statement appealing for an end to the violence.\n\nDuring a daytime lull in the rioting, thousands of people set off Wednesday on five large peaceful protest marches across Catalonia that aim to converge in Barcelona on Friday.\n\nThey included families with children, elderly and young people, and banners reading \u201cLibertat Presos Politics\u201d (Freedom for political prisoners) \u2014 a reference to the 12 leaders sentenced by the Supreme Court.\n\nCatalan regional president Quim Torra, a fervent separatist who critics have called a xenophobe, joined one of the marches, saying he wanted to be next to the people.\n\nAfter three days of ignoring calls to criticize the street violence in the region he governs, Torra bent to the pressure late Wednesday and called for the unrest to stop.\n\n\u201cI make a call for calm and serenity. We separatists have not been and are not violent,\u201d he said in a brief and hurriedly organized televised statement. \u201cThis must stop right now.\u201d", "description": "Rioting raged in Barcelona and several other Catalan towns for a third straight night Wednesday, with police fighting running street battles with protesters...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT472_spain1_ZG_20191016202837.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
