As defenders, as a team and as a unit we know where to improve and where to work on.\n\n'Some games, it just happens. We will analyse what went wrong and try and make sure it does not happen again.\n\n'Kosovo, really, were an underrated side and we had massive respect for them before the game and we knew they had threats and, luckily for us, were able to outscore them but we were not happy with the goals we conceded and we need to work on it.'\n\nA 5-3 win over Kosovo at Southampton last month did little to paper over cracks in defence\n\nAlexander-Arnold also revealed the players were planning on holding a meeting before the game in Prague and the subsequent trip to Sofia to face Bulgaria three days later.\n\n'As players we analyse our games, we know during the game what's going right and what's not,' he said.\n\n'No, we've not had the meeting yet but we will over the next few days to make sure it doesn't happen again. It's important to look back on our game and see where we need to improve.\n\n'The obvious one is that the amount of goals we conceded was not good. It's about making sure we get that right this time.'\n\nChampions League-winning right-back Alexander-Arnold will battle with Kieran Trippier for a place in Southgate's team on Friday night.\n\nThe pair have, for the time being, seen off the challenge of Kyle Walker - who has missed out on the last two squads.\n\nIt remains to be seen who Southgate opts for in the centre of his defence with uncapped pair Tyrone Mings and Fikayo Tomori pushing more established names such as Harry Maguire, Michael Keane and Joe Gomez for a place in the side.", "description": "While the attacking abilities of the likes of Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho are being heralded, England have had some issues at the back of late.", "authors": ["Mark Mann-Bryans", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19514028-0-image-a-15_1570658504262.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
