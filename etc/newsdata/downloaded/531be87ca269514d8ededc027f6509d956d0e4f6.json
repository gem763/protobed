Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe expedited removal process provides drastically truncated administrative procedures, and virtually no judicial review of purely legal claims, and even of claims that the removal would violate the Constitution,\u201d wrote ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt. \u201cBy comparison, noncitizens placed in regular removal proceedings are afforded a full immigration hearing, an administrative appeal, and judicial review on a petition for review to the federal court of appeals.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration, which wants to expand the expedited removal process to apply to even more undocumented immigrants, asked the Supreme Court to review the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision. The effect of the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco told the court, would be to delay removal of aliens such as Thuraissigiam, \u201cpreventing expedited removal of such aliens from being expedited at all and undermining the government\u2019s ability to control the border.\u201d\n\nThe case does not directly concern the administration\u2019s efforts to enhance the expedited removal program to include aliens who have been in the United States as long as two years and could be anywhere in the country. A federal judge has blocked that initiative while litigation continues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThuraissigiam fled Sri Lanka after he said a gang of men beat him so severely he was hospitalized in 2014. He crossed into the United States near the San Ysidro Port of Entry in California and was almost immediately picked up about 25 yards north of the border. He says he is an ethnic Tamil and would be subject to persecution should he be returned to Sri Lanka.\n\nThe government contends he was unable to show that he was targeted. At an interview with an asylum officer, Thuraissigiam \u201cdid not know who the men were or why they had beaten him, that they had not said anything to him and never identified themselves.\u201d\n\nThe officer said Thuraissigiam \u201cprovided no testimony indicating that he was or will be targeted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Thuraissigiam\u2019s lawyers said he deserved the right to challenge that administrative decision before a federal judge. The 9th Circuit agreed, saying its ruling was consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2008 that gave such a right to those being held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba where those suspected of involvement with terrorism are held.\n\nAfter the court accepted the case Friday, Gelernt said in a statement, \u201cIt is a foundational principle of our Constitution that individuals deprived of their liberty have access to a federal court \u2014 this includes asylum-seekers whose lives are in danger.\u201d\n\nThe case is Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam.\n\nAD", "description": "The Trump administration objects to a lower-court ruling that such undocumented immigrants deserve judicial review.", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3s-UW3darjOlrmj8C8Qh_CaaMSM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VCIETEEX5YI6PAXE6EDW63LBKI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
