USA TODAY\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. \u2014 On the same night Bill Belichick took another step toward solidifying his place among the greatest coaches of all time, Freddie Kitchens again looked as though he\u2019s in over his head.\n\nBelichick earned career win No. 300 \u2014 a feat achieved by only Don Shula and George Halas \u2014 and did so while his defense continued its historic campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, Kitchens remains in search of career win No. 3. As his Cleveland Browns fell to 2-5, they drifted further away from their goal of making the playoffs for the first time in 16 years.\n\nThe fact that Cleveland lost to New England came as no surprise. The Patriots are the gold standard, everything the Browns aspire to become.\n\nBut the way in which Cleveland lost \u2014 and most notably the way a team coming off the bye started the game \u2014 reflected most poorly on Kitchens.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 8 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWeek 8 winners, losers: Drew Brees shined in his return; Browns are total disappointment\n\nA three-turnover, penalty-plagued first quarter set the tone for another defeat in which the Browns failed to live up to their potential and instead exited the stadium with a laundry list of coulda-woulda-shoulda\u2019s and uncertainty over the source of their shortcomings.\n\nThere\u2019s confusion because the Browns know exactly what they\u2019re doing or not doing. They just don\u2019t know why.\n\nCleveland committed a whopping 13 penalties against New England, adding to their league-leading tally of 70 through seven games.\n\nFar too often, offensive players have committed false starts (16 in total) because they forgot the snap count. And egregious misses on blocking assignments led to two of their turnovers as well as more busted plays.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not disciplined: guys not being focused on doing their job,\u201d quarterback Baker Mayfield said. \u201cIt starts first and foremost with me, to be a leader every single down. Get guys lined up, make sure that we\u2019re set, we\u2019re paying attention, because if we can\u2019t use cadence, we\u2019re hurting ourselves. Any time we try to use a double count, it seems like we\u2019re false starting a little bit, but we\u2019ll get the disciplined part fixed, the accountability.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to beat the Patriots even with a near-flawless performance. But with showings like Cleveland\u2019s, it's virtually impossible.\n\n\u201cEverything we said we couldn\u2019t do and win the game, we did,\u201d said Kitchens before dismissing the notion that a return from the bye \u2014 when the coaches had extra time to prepare while the players rested \u2014 made the performance tougher to stomach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing any time it happens. Because you know going in that we can\u2019t continue to jump offsides, we can\u2019t continue to do the things that get you beat. It\u2019s very evident that that\u2019s what is getting us beat. It\u2019s turnovers and penalties. That\u2019s it: turnovers and penalties.\u201d\n\nBecause they know the source of their problems, Kitchens and Mayfield say they still have hope for a turnaround.\n\nKitchens must figure out how to get his players to devote a greater attention to detail. Perhaps he and his assistants need to do the same in their own preparations.\n\nHe must figure out how to help Mayfield get more comfortable in the pocket. The quarterback often has a bad case of happy feet whether there\u2019s pressure coming or not. As a result, Mayfield looks anything but dangerous in this sophomore season.\n\nKitchens also must figure out how to do a better job of consistently getting Pro Bowl receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry involved. Each tends to disappear for extended stretches of games at a frequency that\u2019s way too high.\n\nOne of the biggest questions Kitchens faced when the Browns promoted him from interim offensive coordinator to head coach centered on his lack of experience and his ability to handle directing the offense with the same potency of his seven-game audition in 2018 while also running the team as a whole.\n\nSo far, he\u2019s still looking for answers. His quarterback has not progressed, and his offense lacks the same aggression and creativity of a year ago despite talent upgrades at skill positions.\n\nAnd the Browns as a whole lack the discipline and focus required for a playoff run.\n\nThis is definitely a young team in need of growth and development in multiple departments. And it\u2019s well-known that team officials need and want to upgrade their offensive line.\n\nBut Kitchens knows he can\u2019t use his team's youth as an excuse. He has to keep his group focused, instill greater discipline and carry that over into game days.\n\n\u201cI think 2-5, I don\u2019t know what \u2014 everything\u2019s in front of us. I don\u2019t know what else to say about that. Everything\u2019s in front of us,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, win the games that were supposed to win and we\u2019ll be fine.\"\n\nThe only problem is Kitchens has uttered similar words throughout the season.\n\nAfter each loss, he has stressed that it\u2019s important for the Browns guard against panicking while maintaining their focus, and adds that there are still however many games remaining.\n\nThat\u2019s the mindset Kitchens and his players must maintain while improving their approaches. But, unfortunately for them, the results suggest that\u2019s just talk for now, and the season appears to be slipping away.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones and listen to the Football Jones podcast on iTunes.", "description": "At 2-5, the Browns have fallen far short of the outsized expectations they carried this offseason.
