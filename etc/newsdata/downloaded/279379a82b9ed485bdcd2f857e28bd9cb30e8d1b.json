REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nDuduzane Zuma is a key witness at the so-called \u201cstate capture\u201d inquiry set up by presidential decree last year to test allegations of high-level corruption during Jacob Zuma\u2019s nine years in power.\n\nThe inquiry has shocked South Africans with revelations about the brazen way in which some people close to Jacob Zuma allegedly tried to plunder state resources and influence policymaking.\n\nBut the investigation has struggled to nail down convincing evidence of corruption involving top officials - something analysts say could be a problem for Zuma\u2019s successor Cyril Ramaphosa, who is on a campaign to clean up politics.\n\nDuduzane Zuma was a business partner of the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers accused of using their friendship with the former president to win state contracts in the years leading up to Zuma\u2019s ousting as head of state in February 2018.\n\nFormer deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas told the inquiry last year that a Gupta brother offered him a 600 million rand ($40 million) bribe and the position of finance minister at a meeting arranged by Duduzane in 2015, on the condition that Jonas would assist the Guptas with their business ventures.\n\nDuduzane Zuma said on Monday that he did arrange a meeting involving Jonas at a Gupta residence in Johannesburg in 2015 but his testimony about the meeting differed on almost every other detail.\n\nHe said the meeting was between himself, Jonas and businessman Fana Hlongwane to discuss a rumour that Hlongwane was blackmailing Jonas and that the gathering had not ended acrimoniously, as Jonas had reported.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting everything was cool,\u201d Duduzane Zuma told the inquiry. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned in my affidavit, I\u2019ve bumped into Mr Jonas once or twice subsequent to that meeting and my view was there was no hostility.\u201d\n\nHe said he had held similar informal meetings at the Gupta residence \u201call the time\u201d.\n\nAsked about testimony by an ex-provincial official that he was present at another meeting at the Gupta house where a large bribe was allegedly offered, Duduzane Zuma denied he was present.\n\nHe said he had been \u201cconveniently placed at the crime scene most times\u201d and suggested that the testimony of a third witness was a waste of paper.\n\nIndependent political analyst Ralph Mathekga said Duduzane Zuma appeared to be undermining the corruption inquiry in the same manner as his father, who gave several days of evasive testimony in July and said he was the victim of a decades-old plot.\n\nBut the tactic could backfire, Mathekga said, if the inquiry recommended that further investigations should be conducted and Duduzane\u2019s narrative was found to be false.\n\nThe Guptas, who left South Africa shortly after Jacob Zuma\u2019s removal, have not appeared before the inquiry but have submitted an affidavit in which they denied allegations against them.\n\nJacob Zuma retains some loyal followers in the governing African National Congress (ANC) who view him as a champion of policies seeking to tackle the deep racial inequality that persists over two decades after the end of white minority rule.\n\nBut his critics associate Zuma\u2019s leadership with deeply entrenched corruption and erratic policymaking that deterred investment and held back economic growth.\n\n($1 = 15.1477 rand)", "description": "Ex-South African president Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane denied wrongdoing at a graft inquiry on Monday, dismissing testimony of two witnesses who placed him in the room when friends of his father are alleged to have offered large bribes.", "authors": ["Alexander Winning", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438078825&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960VE", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
