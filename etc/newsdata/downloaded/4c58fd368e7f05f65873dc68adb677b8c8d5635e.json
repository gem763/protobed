Sui\u2019s alleged crimes were first reported by the Los Angeles Times last month.\n\nSui is one of dozens of parents accused of paying Rick Singer\u2014a former private college-admissions consultant and the ringleader of the nation\u2019s largest ever college cheating and bribery scheme\u2014to facilitate her son\u2019s entry into an elite school.\n\nSui allegedly wired Singer $400,000 to gain her son admission at UCLA as a fake soccer recruit. Other parents have been accused of paying their children\u2019s way into Yale, Stanford, and the University of Southern California, among other elite schools.\n\nFelicity Huffman, Full House star Lori Loughlin, and dozens of other prominent parents were arrested in March 2019 over their alleged involvement in the scheme, dubbed \u201cOperation Varsity Blues\u201d by the FBI.\n\nHuffman on Friday became the first of 34 charged parents to be sentenced in the case. A federal judge ordered her to spend 14 days in prison, pay a $30,000 fine, serve one year of probation, and volunteer 250 hours of community service after she pleaded guilty in May to paying a Harvard graduate $15,000 to correct her eldest daughter Sophia\u2019s answers on the SAT. The bribe secured Sophia a 400-point bump on the college entrance exam and, ironically, tanked the 19-year-old\u2019s chances of getting into her dream school.\n\nSinger told Sui in August 2018 that her son could be \u201cguaranteed\u201d admission to UCLA in exchange for $400,000, according to the indictment. He has pleaded guilty to fraud, racketeering, money laundering, and obstruction.\n\nLaura Janke, a former University of Southern California soccer coach who also pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in May, then allegedly created a fake soccer profile for Sui\u2019s son, which \u201cdescribed him as a top player for two private soccer clubs in Canada,\u201d according to a Department of Justice press release.\n\nOnce the profile was fabricated, Sui allegedly wired money to Singer\u2019s sham charity organization, Key Worldwide Foundation, and Sui\u2019s son was admitted to UCLA a few weeks later as a recruited soccer player on a 25-percent scholarship.\n\nSui faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. She is being held in Spain until authorities can seek her extradition to Boston on the charges.", "description": "Xiaoning Sui is one of dozens of parents accused of paying a college-admissions consultant\u2019s sham charity to gain her son entry into an elite university.", "authors": ["Olivia Messer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3780,w_6720,x_0,y_700/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568740663/RTS1K4M3_rleweu", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
