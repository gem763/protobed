He's adopted a divisive and nationalistic campaign style and has sought to parlay his close relationship with President Trump to bolster the impression that he alone can guarantee Israel's security.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amir Levy/Getty Images Amir Levy/Getty Images\n\nLikud with its natural allies could muster 56 seats. That likely puts Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party, projected to secure about 10 seats, in the role of kingmaker.\n\nLieberman, a former top aide to Netanyahu who has since fallen out with the prime minister, campaigned on a pledge to bring Likud and Blue and White and his own party into a government. He told supporters election night that is still his goal.\n\n\"Everything we said before the election, we are also saying after the election,\" he said. \"We have only one option: a broad, liberal, national government made up of Yisrael Beitenu, Likud and Blue and White.\"\n\nEven so, Gantz has declined any coalition with Likud while Netanyahu faces corruption charges.\n\nAlthough the results pointed to no clear victory, Netanyahu said he was ready to work on forming a government based on the right ideology.\n\n\"In the coming days we will convene negotiations to assemble a strong Zionist government and to prevent a dangerous anti-Zionist government,\" he said.\n\nAyman Odeh, the head of Jioint List, an alliance of Arab-dominated parties, said Netanyahu's anti-Arab rhetoric had boosted turnout and increased their numbers in parliament. If Gantz and Netanyahu form a coalition, it would leave Joint List the official opposition party in parliament.\n\n\"There's a heavy price to pay for incitement,\" he told Channel 13 television.", "description": "The preliminary results show yet another near deadlock between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and its main centrist rival.", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/18/ap_19261020149138_wide-2851a6817e8c40e4fd0ee05d8e10aa36da3169d9.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
