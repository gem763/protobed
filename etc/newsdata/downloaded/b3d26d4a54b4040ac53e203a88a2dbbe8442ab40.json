Scenes saw Cain save Moira from underwater before the boat then exploded \u2013 and a lot of work went into the spectacular sequence.\n\nBoss Jane Hudson said: \u2018We are doing a year\u2019s culmination of a big story. We have a boat and there\u2019s going to be explosions!\u2019\n\nShe wasn\u2019t wrong! The cast revealed the tricks of the trade with the camera work to make it seem like they were filming in the centre of the lake while having a fight. The team also showed how drones were used to catch some of the scenes as well \u2013 but not everything went to plan as Jeff at one point fell into the lake by accident.\n\nYou know what they say \u2013 never film with children, animals or lakes!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team then headed with director David Kester and some divers to a tank in Basildon to film underwater \u2013 and they had to be held down with rocks in their pockets. At 31 degrees, it was described as a nice bath \u2013 which we\u2019re not sure if the characters of Cain, Nate and Moira would agree with.\n\nNatalie said: \u2018You can\u2019t see anything in the water!\u2019\n\nTonight\u2019s episode saw all three come away unscathed but there is more drama and heartbreak to come. The prospect of Cain and Moira\u2019s marriage surviving this disaster is pretty slim and then there\u2019s also the matter of Nate\u2019s paternity.\n\nCan Cain get his head around the fact that he is his son \u2013 and will Faith (Sally Dexter) come clean about what she knows?\n\nWith everything out in the open, Cain has a lot to process \u2013 so the explosions, at least the metaphorical ones, might be far from over for this long suffering couple.\n\nRevealing what\u2019s to come, Jane added: \u2018It\u2019s a very messy time for Cain, Moira and Nate and the fallout will be huge!\u2019\n\nJeff added: \u2018Where this goes from here, who knows? This is big stuff for Cain!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "What a stunt!", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91165597_1571855782.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
