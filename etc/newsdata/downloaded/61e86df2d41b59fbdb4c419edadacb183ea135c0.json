If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications.\n\nA Southend Council spokesman said: 'Collectively, we are adopting a precautionary approach to this situation to help interrupt any potential further spread.\n\n'As an immediate priority, and alongside our colleagues at the CCG and Southend Care, we are identifying and contacting those people who may have been directly exposed and are offering those people MMR vaccinations if they are not already immunised.\n\nWHO IS MOST AT RISK OF MEASLES? Everyone has a slight risk of developing measles because being vaccinated does not guarantee full immunity. However, unvaccinated young children are particularly at risk, as well as pregnant women who have not had the jab. Measles is common in many developing countries, particularly parts of Africa and Asia. More than 95 percent of measles deaths occur in countries with low average incomes. Outbreaks can be particularly life-threatening in countries experiencing or recovering from natural disasters or conflict. Damage to health services disrupts routine immunization, while overcrowding greatly increases the risk of infection.

If you are unsure about yourself or loved ones, check with your GP.'\n\nCoverage of the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, fell for the fifth year in a row last year.\n\nChildren and young adults should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine for maximum protection. The target figure is 95 per cent.\n\nBut just 87 per cent of children in England are receiving their second dose of MMR, 92 per cent in Wales and Scotland, and 91 per cent in Northern Ireland.\n\nPublic Health England estimated that one in seven five-year-olds started school this year without being vaccinated against measles.\n\nBritain was declared 'measles free' by the World Health Organisation in 2016 after a 36-month period with no 'endemic' transmission \u2013 meaning the only outbreaks in that time had started abroad and were then passed on.\n\nBut after a spike in cases, and because uptake of the MMR jab has fallen year on year, the WHO revoked the measles-free status this year.\n\nThere were more than 230 cases across England during the first quarter of 2019, and 301 in the second quarter.\n\nStudies have found concerns over an autism link are one of the main reasons parents avoid giving their child the vaccine, the NHS state.\n\nA bogus study by Andrew Wakefield claimed the MMR vaccine can lead to autism in 1998 but the findings have been disproven on numerous occasions.\n\nDr Kapadia said: 'If you think you could have measles, it's also really important to stay away from areas where you could come into contact with lots of other people -especially from vulnerable patients in hospitals, care homes or other settings.\n\n'Measles can be serious for these groups and spreads easily in these places.'", "description": "Health officials said eight people are suspected to have measles in the Southend-on-Sea area.
