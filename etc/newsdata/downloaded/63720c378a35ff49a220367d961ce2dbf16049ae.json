This wave has also disrupted areas where Islamic State prisoners have been held and reports make clear that many have fled as Syrian Kurdish forces have abandoned their positions or been overwhelmed by the force of the attack.\n\nIn all of this, the changing situation on the ground means that we must reassess our responsibilities to British Isis prisoners. It is also a fact that we have turned our backs on Kurdish allies. We devolved our responsibilities for our extremist citizens to the Kurds in Iraq and Syria and stepped back and left them to deal with people who, like it or not, emanated from our country.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

We have to address this issue as a matter of urgency and it can\u2019t wait any longer.\n\nWhich is why even though we cannot bring back people like Shamima Begum at this time, for the risk that people like her may pose, we must ascertain their level of risk, threat or not and through interviews, assess how deeply they were involved in supporting the institutional structures of Islamic State. We must therefore send out a team of investigators who can interview every one of our citizens who was associated with or who supported Islamic State. It is an essential piece of work that needs to take place now.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

We need to draw a line between those young and vulnerable people who are so young that they cannot ultimately be left to fend for themselves. It is a difficult line to set but we need to start somewhere and work from there in order to ensure that we maintain our societal core values by providing the opportunity of redemption for some.\n\nWhich means the question needs to be asked as to how we handle the worst of the Isis ideologues. Public opinion will not support the return of all our extremist citizens in Iraq and Syria. In such a divided country as ours, politicians will be loath to make decisions that cost them political support. Furthermore, the Queen\u2019s speech laid out this Government\u2019s policy wish list for the future and it is clear that law and order and harsher punishments are the direction of travel.\n\nRedemption for the worst of the worst in Syria and Iraq is therefore out of the question. However, the time has come to ask the question as to whether we can bring them to trial in British Overseas Territories. This could be a viable alternative to removing people who emanated from our country and who cannot be left free to roam and damage other lives.\n\nRight now, some out of the box thinking is needed to bring this whole shameful debacle to an end. We must show those who supported Isis that justice will be served by us. On the other hand, the public needs to be kept safe. It is time for us to act within reason and within the law.\n\nFiyaz Mughal OBE is the Founder and Director of Faith Matters", "description": "By now it is clear that a phone call between president Donald Trump to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan suggesting that US special forces and observers were to be withdrawn from Northern Syria.
