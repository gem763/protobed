They said they sought his support for background check legislation passed earlier this year by the Democratic-led House, arguing that any plan that doesn\u2019t include the bill, called H.R. 8, \u201cwill not get the job done.\u201d\n\nTheir message came as the White House is working on a series of policy proposals to respond to mass shootings that have left dozens dead in recent weeks in Ohio and Texas. Amid calls for more gun restrictions, the president has said he wants to take action but hasn\u2019t indicated exactly what he will support. Republicans, for their part, have made clear that they need his clear backing to advance anything.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere described the conversation as cordial, saying Mr. Trump \u201cmade no commitments on H.R. 8, but instead indicated his interest in working to find a bipartisan legislative solution on appropriate responses to the issue of mass gun violence.\u201d\n\nA person close to the White House efforts on gun policy said the president has ruled out supporting the House-backed bill, though he would like to see new gun restrictions on people with mental-health issues or a criminal record. White House aides and the president have been talking with lawmakers from both parties, including Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), who have long urged legislation expanding background checks for gun sales.\n\nCurrently, federal law requires background checks only for sales by federally licensed dealers, though some states have added their own requirements.\n\nMore New Report on Brett Kavanaugh Reopens Debate\n\nThe Manchin-Toomey bill that narrowly failed in the Senate in 2013 would have expanded background checks to all commercial sales. The version passed earlier this year in the House is more sweeping, covering nearly all sales.\n\nIdeas discussed include backing state laws that remove guns temporarily from people considered dangerous, subjecting mass shooters to expedited capital punishment and using the national background check system to alert state law-enforcement officials when a person prohibited from purchasing a firearm tries to buy one.\n\nThere have also been discussions around creating an app or digital mechanism to allow for background checks on private gun sales, said several people familiar with the talks.\n\nLast Thursday, after a briefing with top aides, the president told reporters that \u201ca lot of progress\u201d was made on background checks. But he also said that the prospect for action on background checks \u201cdepends on whether or not the Democrats want to take your guns away\u2014because there\u2019s a possibility that this is just a ploy to take your guns away.\u201d\n\nDemocrats generally maintain that they are not trying to take weapons away from law-abiding gun owners. But Republicans have seized on recent comments by former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke who called for mandatory gun buybacks for assault-style weapons during the Democratic presidential debate last week. Those comments drew criticism from some Democrats, who said those words could be used to bolster the GOP talking point.\n\n\u2014Sadie Gurman and Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com", "description": "Democratic leaders urged President Trump to support a House-passed background check bill, as lawmakers wait to see what measures the White House will endorse to reduce mass shootings.", "authors": ["Catherine Lucey", "Catherine.Lucey Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107302/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
