It also fits your bed like a fitted sheet.\n\nFor most of my adult life, I have put little thought into mattress protectors. I always considered them to be one of those things that you need \u2014 you know, as protection from bacteria and debris \u2014 but really not something you need to invest a whole lot of money in. I would stroll into Target or HomeGoods, and basically pick one out with my eyes closed.\n\nHowever, things changed as I got older. For one, my mattresses got more expensive. When you are sleeping on a mattress that is worth a couple thousand dollars, you want to keep it protected \u2014 especially when you have young children and pets who always seem to end up in your bed.\n\nAnother factor is that my husband and I both seem to overheat during the night. So while it is crucial that we have a waterproof mattress cover on our bed if we want to keep it in tip-top shape, most vinyl covers can add to that heat and sweatiness, which is so not fun. I mean, who wants to change their sheets almost every single night due to serious night sweats? Not me.\n\nWell, according to John Merwin, owner and chief executive officer of Brooklyn Bedding, a good mattress protector can be a game-changer.\n\n\"A mattress purchase can be a significant investment. Mattress protectors promote greater longevity of your investment and ensure a cleaner, more hygienic night's sleep,\" he says. \"Because they actually serve as a barrier \u2014 coming between the sleeper and the sleep surface \u2014 some styles can impact the overall breathability of the bed.\"\n\nMakes sense, right?\n\nSo I decided to try Brooklyn Bedding's Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector. I was skeptical about the company's claims of it providing \"luxurious cooling and protection for ultimate comfort.\" How luxurious can a mattress pad be, after all? Could a good mattress pad really up my sleep game?\n\nAccording to Merwin, the company developed the Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector to \"definitively maintain the benefits of advanced cooling technology found in higher-end beds, and even help enhance the breathability of a standard mattress.\"\n\nThe company decided to treat the Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector as a companion to their newly launched Luxury Cooling Pillow. It features the same premium smooth top knit used in the elite Brooklyn Aurora \u2014 their most popular mattress. The result is a silky-smooth fabric that delivers cooling on contact while elevating the overall sleep experience and protecting the life of the mattress.\n\nThe cover is made out of highly conductive materials, designed to draw heat out and away from the body. It is both hypoallergenic and waterproof and protects against bacteria, bed bugs, and dust mites in addition to all types of fluids and liquids. It covers the mattress snugly, like a fitted sheet, and can be easily removed for frequent laundering. This also helps promote a healthier sleep environment.\n\nMy review of the Brooklyn Bedding Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector\n\nMy husband and I had been sleeping on the All New Purple Mattress for a few nights, sans mattress protector, when I received my Brooklyn Bedding protector in the mail. Though we loved our All New Purple Mattress, my husband complained incessantly that its \"smart comfort grid\" made it feel like we were sleeping on an egg crate. I slipped the mattress protector on it, and as promised, it fit like a glove \u2014 no wrinkles, no bunching up, no awkwardly fitting corners. Next, I placed my sheets on top and rolled around a little. No more egg crate!\n\nAs I mentioned before, my husband and I both tend to sleep hot. There have been nights that I have woken up repeatedly soaking wet for reasons that remain unexplained. But really, can a mattress protector actually prevent this from happening? Apparently so. I have been sleeping on it for several weeks now, and while I might heat up a little during the night, I have yet to get to the point of overheating.\n\nAs for the protector's waterproof claims, I can also attest to that. One evening my toddler had a little accident while she was sleeping in our bed. I tore off the sheets and mattress protector in fear that our new mattress was ruined, but to my relief, it was perfectly dry!\n\nI tossed it in the wash, laundered it in warm water with no bleach added, and then threw it in the dryer on low. It came out just as perfect as before!\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI will never, I repeat NEVER, again sleep with a regular, old cheap mattress protector on my bed. I admit, I was a total skeptic about investing money in a mattress proteor before I tried out Brooklyn Bedding's Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector, but it has made me a total convert.\n\nI can honestly say that this protector has not only kept my mattress from being soaked with urine, but also made my sleeping experience so much cooler and blissful.\n\nInvest in your sleep and do yourself a favor: Try this bad boy out!
