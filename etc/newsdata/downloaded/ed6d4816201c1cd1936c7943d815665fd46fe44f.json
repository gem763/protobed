As a result, only the most focused organisations had completed their GDPR readiness by the time the legislation came into force,\" Chris Cooper, head of cybersecurity practice at Capgemini, told ZDNet.\n\nBusinesses that aren't yet compliant with privacy legislation point to a number of obstacles that prevent them from being so. Chief among those is legacy IT systems, with 38% of those surveyed suggesting that their current IT landscape isn't aligned to the complexities of GDPR.\n\nMeanwhile, 36% believe the requirements of GDPR are too complex and require a lot of general effort to implement, while one third of respondents say that the financial costs of achieving alignment with GDPR are too prohibitive.\n\nNot only are businesses that remain non-compliant putting themselves at risk of falling victim to a data breach and the financial and reputational damage that could create \u2013 alongside the financial cost of a regulator fine \u2013 they're also holding themselves back from the benefits that compliance can bring.\n\nThe Capgemini survey found that of those organisations that are fully GDPR-compliant, 92% of executives from these firms believe that being so has given them a competitive advantage by enabling them to improve customer trust, customer satisfaction and brand image, with all of this helping to boost revenue.\n\nGDPR-compliant organisations also point to benefits behind the scenes, with around four in five of those surveyed of the opinion that being compliant with data protection regulation has helped improve IT systems and cybersecurity practices throughout the organisation.\n\n\"Organisations need to promote a data protection and privacy mindset among employees and integrate advanced technologies to boost data discovery, data management, data quality, cybersecurity, and information security efficiencies,\" said the report.\n\n\"Firms that take these actions proactively \u2013 and view data protection and privacy regulation as an opportunity \u2013 will secure a significant competitive advantage\".\n\nSEE: GDPR one year later: The challenges organizations still face\n\nAn ICO spokesperson also told ZDNet that GDPR can help organisations improve how they operate and the way they're perceived by clients and customers.\n\n\n\n\"We want organisations to focus on how data protection law can help them to get it right and enhance their reputations by earning people's trust and confidence, rather than how they might be punished if they get it wrong.\"\n\nOrganisations should also note that data protection is an ongoing issue that needs to be repeatedly reexamined: just because an organisation was compliant on a certain date, that doesn't mean it shouldn't continue to examine how it handles data \u2013 because complicity could easily result in future trouble.\n\n\"The introduction of GDPR was not a deadline but the start of an ongoing process and there is a lot more work to be done. That said, we will not hesitate to act in the public's best interests when organisations wilfully or negligently break the law,\" said an ICO statement.\n\nMORE ON DATA PROTECTION", "description": "GDPR came into force over a year ago but many organisations are still struggling to comply with data privacy legislation - despite the prospect of fines.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/25/593191a6-95bd-492d-9893-8ddd7f8bc280/thumbnail/770x578/e7c60418e0b6c5f5e8a45309c15f188c/istock-gdpr-image-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
