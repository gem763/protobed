The downside is that she sometimes feels exhausted, as work occupies practically all of her time.\n\nAccording to the report, 80 percent of China's so-called amphibious youth-young people who have one or more additional jobs-work more than 12 hours a day.\n\nRuan Fang, a global partner with Boston Consulting Group, says the millennial generation is quite different from their predecessors, as they don't set obvious boundaries between work and life. \"Work has become an integral part of their lives.\"\n\nShe adds that the internet boom has also provided more opportunities for young people to live double lives in their free time. And they are also more open to making their hobbies profitable.\n\nYuan Chunran, a 29-year-old college teacher in Beijing, started offering online painting courses in 2016. These now generate around 20,000 yuan per month-70 to 80 percent of his monthly income.", "description": "Today's 'amphibious youth' are multitasking millennials, who look to turn hobbies into profitable undertakings that bring them professional fulfillment, Chen Meiling reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/17/5da7b9cca310cf3e97a19747.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
