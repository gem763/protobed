The video has been liked more than 946,000 times.\n\nThe initial response to the video was shock \u2014 and mockery at people who didn\u2019t know Panera\u2019s food came frozen. \u201cMost chain restaurants freeze their foods\u2026 everyone needs to chill, Panera still bomb,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nThe woman, who goes by the username brianneraelenee on TikTok and Bri on Twitter, shared a tweet on Oct. 11 saying that had she lost her job because of the video. She also shared an emotional video of what appeared to be the immediate aftermath of her firing on TikTok.\n\nBefore sharing this update, Bri had also published several videos defending Panera for freezing food, and apologizing. \u201cI like my job, I\u2019m really not trying to get fired,\u201d she said in one. She did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn a statement to TIME, a Panera spokesperson Gina Petraglia says the company does not discuss personnel matters and so couldn\u2019t verify if Bri was let go because of the mac and cheese video.\n\nPetraglia did verify that Panera freezes many of its soups and mac and cheese. Freezing allows the company to \u201cavoid using certain preservatives that do not meet our clean standards,\u201d Petraglia said. \u201cThe way we prepare our mac & cheese ensures that people can walk into any Panera nationwide and get the same delicious, clean mac & cheese that makes it one of our most popular items.\u201d Panera serves at least 3 million servings of mac and cheese monthly, according to the company.\n\nIn a Tweet Monday, Bri said she doesn\u2019t believe she was wrongfully terminated. \u201cHaving such long nails and my phone out is a risk to food safety and health regulations,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEverything was completely justified.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want it to be known that I respect Panera and what the situation is,\u201d she added in a later tweet. \u201cIt was a mistake on my part and there really isn\u2019t a way to take back the video.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jasmine Aguilera at jasmine.aguilera@time.com.", "description": "A woman says she lost her job at Panera Bread because of her viral TikTok video showing that the chain's mac and cheese is delivered frozen", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/panera-mac-cheese-tiktokp-video.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
