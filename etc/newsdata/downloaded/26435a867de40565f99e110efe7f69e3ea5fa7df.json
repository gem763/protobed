Shut them down and start again", "language": "en", "text": "Britain\u2019s biggest police force is now institutionally unjust, and so is not fit for the task we have entrusted to it. The report by Sir Richard Henriques into its \u2018VIP paedophiles\u2019 investigation is one of the most devastating ever published about any official body.\n\nIf any other organisation was involved, we would disband it and start again, as I increasingly believe we should do with the police. This horrible mess is closely linked to their failure to control or deal with the crimes they increasingly regard as petty, of theft and disorder. The same sort of mind that ignores these things is all-too-readily convinced by mad claims that the country is beset with high-level paedophile plots.\n\nThe Met\u2019s Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, did not respond to the report in person, but instead sent her deputy, Sir Stephen House, out on to the doorstep. He gave a sort of railway apology, pungent with insincerity. He was \u2018deeply sorry\u2019 for mistakes that \u2018were made\u2019 \u2013 not mistakes that he had made or the force had made. They had \u2018been made\u2019 passively by somebody or other, not named.\n\nThe Met\u2019s Commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick (pictured yesterday), did not respond to the report in person, but instead sent her deputy, Sir Stephen House, out on to the doorstep\n\nThe force, he explained, did not agree with everything Sir Richard Henriques had said. I\u2019ll bet it doesn\u2019t. People who have been caught bang to rights tend not to agree. And why should they? The officers involved have escaped any serious action against them despite withering criticism.\n\nThe force may have had to fork out a bit of public money in compensation to the innocent men whose reputations it casually besmirched and whose private lives it publicly trampled on. But no deterrent or exemplary punishment has been exacted and, in my view, nobody will change his or her ways. As usual in her magically propelled career, Dame Cressida, Madam Teflon, is wholly unaffected despite her personal involvement at the start of the whole thing.\n\nNor could her underling, Sir Stephen, stop making the same basic, wilful mistake that led to all the other miseries and stupidities that ended with his officers bursting into the home of a wholly innocent war hero in his 90s. Before he vanished back into the warmth of New Scotland Yard, he repeatedly used the word \u2018victim\u2019 to describe sex abuse complainants.\n\nThe Henriques report hammers home the point that those who allege they have been sexually abused just must not be called \u2018victims\u2019 until their alleged assailants have been convicted. The use of the word \u2018victim\u2019 prejudices the whole procedure from the start. It lay behind all the cruel mistakes of this investigation. Some complaints are false and so those complainants are not \u2018victims\u2019.\n\nStephen House, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner, speaks to the media outside New Scotland Yard, London on October 4\n\nBut when I asked the Yard why the Deputy Commissioner had referred to \u2018victims\u2019 in defiance of the report, it responded with a flat refusal to pay any attention. It said the Henriques recommendation that they should stop talking about \u2018victims\u2019 before trial \u2018was not accepted by the Metropolitan Police Service as this is a commonly accepted term across a wide range of guidance, policy and legislation.\n\n\u2018This issue has been widely debated and differing views exist. The use of the word victim is not intrinsically linked to the issue of belief. The Met police continues to support the use of the term \u201cvictim\u201d. This does not confer any judgment on the allegations they make which will always be investigated impartially and with an open mind.\u2019\n\nWhich is pure garbage from start to finish. The word is plainly prejudicial. It is a direct attack on the presumption of innocence, which is all that stands between us and tyranny. Investigated and excoriated by a senior judge of huge experience, the force refuses to punish anybody, claims that plainly wrong actions were fine and continues to defy the most basic rules of justice. I wish I thought this would finish it. But it will not.\n\nWhy were the useless BBC so hard on Naga?\n\nNaga Munchetty, the BBC presenter ludicrously condemned by the Corporation\u2019s \u2018Executive Complaints Unit\u2019\n\nI am sorry for Naga Munchetty, the BBC presenter ludicrously condemned by the Corporation\u2019s \u2018Executive Complaints Unit\u2019 for expressing some perfectly reasonable and unsurprising opinions about Donald Trump.\n\nI have had many dealings with the ECU, which is generally quite incapable of admitting the BBC has done anything wrong, especially when it has. So I am baffled that it should have made such a stern ruling on this.\n\nActually, it would make much more sense if the BBC stopped pretending its presenters did not have any opinions, when it is obvious from their tone of voice, slant of question and facial expressions that they do. They might as well try to pretend that they don\u2019t have any heads.\n\nPerhaps it just doesn\u2019t want to admit almost all of its presenters have the same opinion, a tediously fashionable set of London Left-wing prejudices. If it conceded that, it might have to hire some staff who took a different view.\n\nWhen will people learn that we live in a post-revolutionary society? In the Blair years the last traces of Christian conservatism were removed from law and government, and in the Cameron-May years nobody tried to restore them.\n\nSo Dr David Mackereth really shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when he was sacked as a claim assessor for refusing to bow down to the Trans lobby by saying he would not call a six-foot bearded man \u2018madam\u2019.\n\nThis defiance was described by a tribunal as \u2018lack of belief\u2019 in transgenderism. And so it is. These \u2018isms\u2019 are our new highly intolerant religion. We must all now either get our minds right, or retreat into private life and internal exile. The Tories aren\u2019t going to save us.\n\nThe \u2018right to life\u2019... twisted into the right to kill\n\n\u2018Human rights\u2019 is a very stretchable term, as we all know. But I never saw it stretched so far as it was last week, when the Belfast High Court ruled that a right to life was, in fact, a right to death, and indeed a right to kill.\n\nIt decided that Northern Ireland\u2019s laws restricting abortion breached Europe\u2019s human rights convention.\n\nAbortion is illegal in the province unless there is a direct threat to the mother\u2019s life, or a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health, a position many would regard as a reasonable compromise.\n\nBut the ever-ambitious, ever-liberal \u2018Supreme\u2019 Court in London had already paved the way for this ruling by deciding any limit somehow breaches Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. How? This article says nothing at all about abortion, but simply enshrines \u2018private and family life\u2019.\n\nIt also says the courts can override privacy to intervene \u2018for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u2019. Well, how about the right to life of the baby being aborted? Isn\u2019t that \u2018the rights and freedoms of others\u2019?\n\nArticle 2 actually says \u2018everyone\u2019s right to life shall be protected by law\u2019. Everyone\u2019s. Not just some people\u2019s. How then can it have been interpreted to create a right to abortion?\n\nThe authors of the convention never imagined it was any such thing. This shocking twisting of its meaning is the best argument I can think of against the Rule of Lawyers we now endure.\n\nIf you want to comment on Peter Hitchens click here.", "description": "The report by Sir Richard Henriques into its 'VIP paedophiles' investigation is one of the most devastating ever published about any UK official body.", "authors": ["Peter Hitchens For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/00/19346746-0-image-a-29_1570319407571.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
