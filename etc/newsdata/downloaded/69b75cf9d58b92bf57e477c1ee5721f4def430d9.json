While British lawmakers could reject the pact on Saturday, the possibility of increased government spending in Europe and further U.S. interest-rate cuts may help keep wind in the euro\u2019s sails.\n\nIt will also receive a boost if the European Central Bank looks away from monetary easing and steps up its demands for fiscal stimulus. In recent months, the steady stream of poor economic data out of the region has intensified speculation that the ECB will add to its bond-buying stimulus. Yet its latest wave of quantitative easing faces internal opposition. ECB President Mario Draghi may repeat his call for governments to increase their spending at his final meeting later this month.\n\nThis time round, the plea may not fall on deaf ears.\n\nGerman politicians are coming around to the concept of abandoning the much-heralded \u201cblack zero\u201d -- the country\u2019s long-held commitment to a balanced budget -- in case a downturn requires a powerful response. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government cut its 2020 growth forecast to 1% recently, down from an earlier 1.5%, while China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to levels last seen in the early 1990s.\n\nOn top of this, Draghi\u2019s promise of open-ended quantitative easing is also coming into question. The interest rate for overnight loans between European banks, known as Eonia, has actually risen as banks prepare for the start of ECB\u2019s tiered deposit rate system, which is designed to mitigate the cost of lower rates.\n\nReuters reported last week that the ECB has one year of German debt to buy before reaching its limit, and that policy makers would prefer bending the capital key and buying fewer German bonds instead of changing the issuer limit, also supporting the euro.\n\nOutside the shared currency\u2019s area, add to the mix weak U.S. data, which may force the Federal Reserve to make further cuts, enough in itself to set the euro up for further gains. Production at U.S. factories fell in September by the most in five months, retail sales unexpectedly posted the first decline in seven months, and a gauge of inflation expectations from the New York Fed fell last month to the lowest level since 2013.\n\nCertainly, the euro isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. Dollar liquidity may tighten toward year-end and trade tensions between U.S. and the EU could flare up. As ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane noted, the convergence of inflation toward its aim has recently slowed and partly reversed.\n\nBut as sentiment gets increasingly bullish for the euro -- options traders need to pay a premium to own upside exposure across tenors now -- risks are brewing that technical resistance around $1.12 may not be able to absorb buying pressure for long.\n\nNOTE: Vassilis Karamanis is an FX and rates strategist who writes for Bloomberg.
