In our paper, we present evidence of storage and delayed consumption of bone marrow at Qesem Cave.\u201d\n\nThe remains found in Qesem Cave suggest humans brought the remains of animal carcasses, mostly the limbs and skulls of fallow deer, back to the cave for storage, while the animal was stripped for meat at the hunting site.\n\n\u201cWe found that the deer leg bones, specifically the metapodials, exhibited unique chopping marks on the shafts, which are not characteristic of the marks left from stripping fresh skin to fracture the bone and extract the marrow,\u201d said Jordi Rosell, a professor of archaeology at Rovira i Virgili University in Spain.\n\nResearchers estimate the limbs were left covered in skin to help preserve the marrow for consumption later.\n\nIn the lab, scientists replicated the prehistoric preservation process. Their experiments showed the marrow could be stored without spoilage for up to nine weeks.\n\n\u201cThe bones were used as \u2018cans\u2019 that preserved the bone marrow for a long period until it was time to take off the dry skin, shatter the bone and eat the marrow,\u201d Barkai said.\n\nThe latest findings undermine the view of Paleolithic humans as living exclusively hand-to-mouth, always in search of their next meal and vulnerable to prolonged periods of scarcity.\n\n\u201cWe show for the first time in our study that 420,000 to 200,000 years ago, prehistoric humans at Qesem Cave were sophisticated enough, intelligent enough and talented enough to know that it was possible to preserve particular bones of animals under specific conditions, and, when necessary, remove the skin, crack the bone and eat the bone marrow,\u201d said Tel Aviv archaeologist Avi Gopher.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 Paleolithic humans stored animal bones for as long as two months before eating the marrow.
