(AP Photo/Morry Gash) Associated Press\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) \u2014 American heptathlete Erica Bougard says she wasn\u2019t trying to make an international political statement against Qatar\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policies. She was just wearing her favorite high jump shoes.\n\nShe has worn the shoes, with a rainbow flap across one foot to symbolize gay pride, all season. She didn\u2019t consider how that would be taken in Qatar, a conservative Muslim nation, where homosexual acts are illegal.\n\nBy slipping on the Wednesday night, she stepped into a touchy subject that organizers for the track world championships and the 2022 World Cup here have tried to avoid.\n\nIAAF president Sebastian Coe ducked the issue when asked about anti-LGBTQ laws on the eve of the championships. Dahlan Al Hammad, the head of the local organizing committee, said Qatar would comply with international laws.\n\nBougard said she didn\u2019t know all the background.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not afraid of the consequences,\u201d Bougard said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m well protected.\u201d\n\nIf anything does happen, \u201cI\u2019ll be on the first flight out.\u201d\n\nBritish race walker Tom Bosworth, who came out publicly in 2015 and proposed to his boyfriend at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, has been critical of the anti-LGBTQ laws in Qatar. He put out a saying he would respect the laws of the host country and make no political statements while he was there to compete. He races Friday.\n\nBougard started dating her girlfriend about a year ago and wants to be an advocate for people struggling with sexual identity.\n\n\u201cI feel like we have a voice, us as athletes, because more people look at us to perform,\u201d said the 26-year-old who competed at Mississippi State. \u201cIt\u2019s important because I feel like people hate people for loving who they love. Some people don\u2019t believe in it, which is totally fine. I wanted to show my side and put the symbol on my shoe.\u201d\n\nBougard wasn\u2019t concerned about any sort of fallout after completing the first four of seven heptathlon events in a competition spread out over two days. In fourth place going into Day 2 on Thursday, she\u2019s in striking distance of a medal as she trails teammate Kendell Williams by two points. The long jump, javelin and 800-meter run remain.\n\n\u201cHopefully I do get a lot of praise (on social media),\u201d Bougard said. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t get bashed a lot.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s glad people took notice.\n\n\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think about it because it was already on my shoe,\u201d she said. \u201cI put the flag on my shoe and people noticed it, I guess.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: and", "description": "DOHA, Qatar (AP) \u2014 American heptathlete Erica Bougard says she wasn\u2019t trying to make an international political statement against Qatar\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policies.
