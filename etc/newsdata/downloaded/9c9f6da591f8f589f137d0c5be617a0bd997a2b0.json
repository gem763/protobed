They desired democratic principles, but not a democracy. As Plato decrees above, a democracy can easily be commandeered to establish a totalitarian state. The Founders inherently understand this, and wholly rejected forming a democracy.\n\n\u2026democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.[2]\n\nAnd Madison goes on to splendidly explain how this very same \u201cerroneous\u201d belief held by collectivists destroys property rights, which is foundational to any free society:\n\nTheoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.[3]\n\nMadison reiterates the view of Plato over 2000 years prior when, in The Republic, Plato writes that the loss of principles sends a democracy spiraling into tyranny. \u201c[T]he neglect of other things,\u201d writes Plato, \u201cintroduce the change in democracy, which occasions a demand for tyranny.\u201d Just as Samuel warned the Israelites nearly 3000 years ago as their principles and Faith in God waned, Plato issued a warning which has now befallen the United States. With each Presidential cycle, many Americans demand a powerful strongman to ease their suffering, and falsely and foolishly believe we are a democracy. \u201c[T]he same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy \u2013 the truth being that the excessive increase in anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction,\u201d forewarns Plato, \u201cThe excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only to pass into excess slavery\u2026And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy.\u201d[4]\n\nCincinnatus,[5] in Anti Federalist No. 64, gives a description of a democracy. \u201cA democracy,\u201d declares Cincinnatus, \u201cwhich, thus bereft of its powers, and shorn of its strength, will stand a melancholy monument of popular impotence.\u201d[6] Not a raving support of such governmental structures flowing from the pen of Cincinnatus, disclosing the distain our Founders had for such a political structure.\n\nIn fact, the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d appears nowhere in either the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution, and Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution guarantees \u201cto every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\u201d[7] James Madison, known as the Father of the Constitution, states we are to exist under \u201crepublican constitutions,\u201d[8] referencing both the Federal Constitution and the State Constitutions, not constitutions under a democracy.\n\nThe functional deficiency of a democracy is unprotected majority rule \u2013 or tyranny of the majority. The majority simply cannot rule otherwise, it could, and would, simply vote in advantages and even the theft and destruction of the minority. This is the very reason for a moral compact recognizing Fundamental Right; our Natural Right, rights which are bestowed upon us by our Creator. Therefore, regardless of majority opinion, or vote, these Natural Rights remain always, utterly undisturbed by others; whether government or the majority. The only purpose of a civil government is to protect our Natural Rights. Adam Smith elucidated in 1759 that \u201cAll government is but an imperfect remedy for the deficiency of [wisdom and virtue];\u201d[9] thus acknowledging the fallen nature of man, as did our Forefathers and Founding Fathers.\n\nCalifornia State University professor of political science, Edward Erler, expounds this point, writing, \u201cThe majority cannot invade the rights of the minority\u2026Nor can unanimous consent \u2018rightfully\u2019 do what is intrinsically unjust\u2026Majority rule itself can operate only within certain bounds.\u201d[10] Yes, quite often the voice of the majority is completely irrelevant as even the voice of the majority is bound to the sovereign rights of the individual and those rights which God bequeathed upon each of us at Creation.\n\nAttorney and Professor Jenna Ellis explains, \u201cIt does not matter to Divine Law whether an individual \u201cagrees\u201d with biblical principles \u2013 we are not free under Divine Law to negotiate the fixed, objective scientific and construct of law.\u201d[11] Natural Law, God\u2019s Law, is immutable and immovable. And this is why America is a conscious republic, not a democracy.\n\n[1]Plato, 1999 (Originally published in 360 BC), The Republic, Book VIII, (New York, NY: Barnes & Nobles Book), p. 264.\n\n[2]James Madison, November 22, 1787, Federalist Paper No. 10.
