She forced the issue this week by filing a court injunction against the Canadian organization, but a judge did not rule in her favour.\n\nBCS high-performance director Chris Le Bihan has said he wants her back on the national team. Humphries isn't buying it.\n\n\"I will not be returning to Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton with the administration as it exists at this point,\" Humphries told The Canadian Press in an email Wednesday.\n\n\"It's been made very clear I am not wanted by them, and I do not feel safe psychologically and physically.\"\n\nBCS would not comment Wednesday. A spokesman said Le Bihan made the organization's position clear Tuesday when a judge shot down Humphries' request for an injunction.\n\n\"We believe we have a safe and a high-performing training environment for all athletes,\" Le Bihan said at the courthouse.\n\n\"We want Kaillie in our program.
