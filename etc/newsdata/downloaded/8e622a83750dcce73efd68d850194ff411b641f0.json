Hawley said in a statement. \"That\u2019s a big part of the problem with Washington: they\u2019re too removed from the rest of America. The HIRE Act will move policymakers directly into the communities they serve, creating thousands of jobs for local communities and saving taxpayers billions of dollars along the way.\"\n\nHere's a list of what agencies could potentially be moved out of D.C.:\n\nDepartment of Agriculture -- Missouri Department of Commerce --Pennsylvania Department of Education --Tennessee Department of Energy -- Kentucky Health and Human Services --Indiana Housing and Urban Development -- Ohio Department of Interior -- New Mexico Department of Labor -- West Virginia Department of Transportation -- Michigan Veterans Affairs -- South Carolina\n\n\"Moving agencies outside of Washington, D.C. both boosts local economies and lowers costs \u2013 that\u2019s a winning combination,\" Sen. Blackburn said of the bill. \"This legislation would enable Americans across the country to have greater access to good jobs. Tennesseans would greatly benefit from having portions of the Department of Education in the Volunteer State. It is my hope that the HIRE Act will quickly pass the Senate.\"", "description": ".10/26/2019 7:08:04AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/295/0a1b6a1e-fb99-4043-9c61-6aac75e5b330.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
