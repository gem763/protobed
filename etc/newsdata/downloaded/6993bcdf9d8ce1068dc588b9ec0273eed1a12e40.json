I\u2019ve loved every second, this man has changed my life.\u2019\n\nCatherine and Johannes were up against Mike and Katya (Picture: BBC)\n\nViewers were seething at the panelists\u2019 decision though and raged at Catherine\u2019s exit news on Twitter, with one writing: \u2018What on earth has happened \u2013 ridiculous decision \u2013 is it because he works for the BBC?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEchoing a similar sentiment, another added: \u2018Terrible decision by the judges there. Wrong couple voted off for me.\u2019\n\nStrictly Come Dancing fans aren\u2019t happy with the results of tonight\u2019s elimination\n\nTerrible decision by the judges there.

And my timeline appears to be unanimous on this. This year\u2019s series is not improving. #Strictly \u2014 Annette Hardy (@Annette1Hardy) October 27, 2019\n\nThey\u2019re the fifth couple to be eliminated (Picture: BBC)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time fans have raged over the results from this series.\n\nEarlier this month, viewers kicked off when radio presenter Dev Griffin was booted from the competition.\n\nHead judge Shirley Ballas admitted that she was on the receiving end of death threats after sending Dev home.\n\nTalking on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show, she said: \u2018[Dev\u2019s] marks weren\u2019t low, they were in the middle of the pack, and at the end of the day, you can only go on the dance that is put in front of you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Not past performance, not what you think he is capable of.\u2019\n\nOne member of the Strictly cast to have spoken out in Shirley\u2019s defense is pro dancer AJ Pritchard, who has begged fans to focus on positivity rather than sending abuse to the judges.\n\n\u2018There is no excuse for the trolling and death threats. All the abuse they have been getting is not right,\u2019 the 24-year-old said.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing returns Saturday at 7pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
