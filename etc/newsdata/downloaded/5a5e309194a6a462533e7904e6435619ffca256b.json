The exhibit, titled \u201cHILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails,\u201d was created by artist Kenneth Goldsmith.\n\nFrancesco Urbano Ragazzi, who curated the show, said in a statement that Clinton visited the former movie theater for the exhibit Tuesday. Urbano Ragazzi said that Clinton sat down the exact replica of the resolute desk in the Oval Office, where she spent roughly an hour looking through her emails.\n\nHillary Clinton spent an hour yesterday reading her emails at my exhibition of all 62,000 pages of them in Venice.
