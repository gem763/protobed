Watson died in a horror car crash in August, while Bosasa is in liquidation and at the centre of state capture investigations.\n\nIn his book Basson reveals:\n\nWatson deceived the ANC Women's League when the company was formed. They believed they owned it, while in actual fact Watson took ownership.\n\nWatson had pictures of Basson and Willie Hofmeyr, a former head of the Special Investigations Unit, which he blessed and prayed for. He even had a white cross with a picture of Hofmeyr in his garden.\n\nHow the late Vernie Petersen, a former prisons boss, was hounded from office by then prisons minister Ngconde Balfour and feared for his life when he started questioning the Bosasa tenders. He died a broken man.\n\nThat Nomvula Mokonyane, who was fired by President Cyril Ramaphosa and now works at Luthuli House, was \"like an employee at Bosasa\" and that Watson expected staff \"to drop everything\" when she made demands.\n\nEXTRACT | Blessed by Bosasa: Inside Gavin Watson's 'cult rituals'\n\nIn February, Basson testified at the Zondo judicial commission of inquiry into state capture about being threatened while he and colleague Carien du Plessis were investigating the corrupt tenders Bosasa won from the correctional services department. He also revealed there were plans to \"eliminate\" him and take him to a prison in Zimbabwe or Zambia.\n\nBasson writes that Watson's life was much removed from what he preached, and that among Bosasa employees it was known that he was engaged in an extramarital affair with a \"dark-haired, brown eyed enigma\" - former rag queen Lindie Gouws.\n\nAccording to various interviews with senior Bosasa employees and former Watson colleagues, including whistle-blower Angelo Agrizzi, Gouws had an extraordinary hold over Watson and that he almost never challenged or disagreed with her.\n\nCalling herself \"the bride of Christ\", and often referred to as \"Mrs Watson\" or \"die grootbaas se cherrie\" (the big boss\u2019s girlfriend), she seemingly lived with Watson at a complex in Krugersdorp, with her underwear being spotted on his washing line, her car outside his house while he walked around near-naked in his boxer shorts and doing shopping together. His bathroom was also filled with her cosmetics.\n\nShe denied the affair to Basson, saying that she did not have a sexual relationship with Watson. \"The rumour was purposefully spread on the [Bosasa] campus that we had an affair. People have a perverted image [of our relationship],\" she said.\n\n.\n\nGouws was enormously influential in the company. Watson was described as \"overpowering\", \"dominating\" and \"forceful\", except when it came to Gouws.\n\nDenise Bjorkan, a former senior former Bosasa employee, told Basson: \"She could tell him any crap and he would believe it.\" She was concerned about the \"hold\" Gouws had on Watson and both she and Agrizzi witnessed the loud-mouthed, bullying and botoxed Bosasa CEO cower before her.\n\nBasson details an incident where she threw her car keys at Watson, shouting: \"Where is my f*cking laundry? \" while Agrizzi overheard a telephone conversation where Watson was reduced to saying \"sorry for this and sorry for that\".\n\nAgrizzi then asked him when will he \"stop this sh*t\" and quoted a Bible passage about adultery.\n\nWatson told Agrizzi that he wasn't having an affair. \"I said to him, 'You are having an affair, I'm telling you now. You are the only one who doesn't know you're having an affair. Everybody f*cking knows'.\"\n\nBasson also reveals details of male executives preying on female staff. One executive bought a fridge for every woman he had sex with, while another was caught having sex on a boardroom table. Cleaners also complained of the company's guesthouse on the Bosasa premises in Krugersdorp, with \"all the semen\" staining the desks, floor and beds.\n\nWatson is also portrayed as a bully and bombast who insulted employees who were overweight and wasn't afraid to call black employees and colleagues \"k*****s\".\n\nHe told Agrizzi and senior employee Retief van der Merwe: \"You better get these k*****s in line.\" He also called them \"darkies\", saying: \"Why do you think I employ these k*****s? Because they're stupid. They've got nothing between the ears. They\u2019re thick and I can control them. I can do whatever I want with them; they need the money.\"", "description": "A new book by Adriaan Basson reveals that Gavin Watson, the former CEO of corruption-tainted company Bosasa, led a life much removed from his carefully crafted image of devout Christian and struggle stalwart.
