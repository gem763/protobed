But because \u201cpeople love to help celebrate a wedding,\u201d Keith continues, \u201cwe did one at our parents\u2019 request that was not too over the top.\u201d\n\nBefore the two officially tied the knot in an intimate ceremony at Manhattan\u2019s City Hall, they were \u201ctogether for awhile,\u201d Keith says, and \u201cthere was a lot of stuff that we just had.\u201d But for part of their relationship, they were a long-distance couple, so the registry provided an opportunity to ask for things they could use to cook and entertain guests now that they were living together again. \u201cThat informed a lot of the choices we made,\u201d she says. Below, Keith shares her favorite items from their registry, including the Italian ironing board she says makes doing laundry much more joyful, the pizza stone her husband swears by, and more.\n\nWilliams Sonoma European Ironing Board \u201cThis is probably the item I lusted after most on the whole registry, as insane as that sounds. But hear me out: I legitimately enjoy ironing. It\u2019s both meditative and results-oriented. And every other ironing board on the market is rickety and prone to pinching \u2014 I\u2019ve hated them all. Now I save a big stack of items to iron in my living room in front of the windows with this big-ass wooden board and it is heaven.\u201d $130 at Williams Sonoma Buy\n\nAlessi Dry 24-piece Cutlery Set \u201cWe didn\u2019t go super-traditional with our registry (no towels, no matching dishes). However, flatware is something you\u2019ll pretty much never prioritize for yourself, and my husband and I both wanted to be fully stocked and ready to host a dinner party at a moment\u2019s notice. I bugged a lot of design-y friends for their own picks, and one of them \u2014 who\u2019s worked with Alessi for years \u2014 advocated for Dry, a timeless design that Achille Castiglioni did for the company in 1982. In fact, it was Alessi\u2019s only cutlery pattern for a number of years. This spring during Milan design week, I paid a visit to Castiglioni\u2019s studio and cemented the choice after manhandling Dry prototypes and admiring the designer\u2019s overall genius.\u201d $405 at Y Living Buy\n\nFferrone Design Dearborn Carafe \u201cFelicia Ferrone is a favorite designer of mine to tap when sending gifts to just-married friends. (Case in point: the Margot Champagne coupes I bought for one couple after seeing them on set during a Curbed shopping-guide shoot.) And if an ironing board is a workhorse, this crystal-esque pitcher is a real show pony. It\u2019s mostly kept in its box, inside a credenza, primed to trot out for guests. I\u2019m picturing it more as a vase (fall forsythia!) than something to pour liquid from.\u201d $150 at 2Modern Buy\n\nIittala Nappula Tall Candleholder \u201cI\u2019m constantly on the hunt for (unscented) candles, but totems alone do not a tablescape make! Knowing that Nordic companies have the \u2018unfussy candleholder\u2019 category on lock, I put these sweet, simple holders from Iittala on our registry. The mossy green complements our general color palette of neutrals (black, white, tan) mixed with goldenrod yellow, rust, and pale blue. Of course, now I\u2019m eyeing the other colors available, as well as the shorter, squatter version.\u201d $50 at 2Modern Buy\n\nCarl Durkow Beeswax Candle \u201cNow, if anyone is feeling generous and wants to send some Carl Durkow beeswax candles my way \u2026 I discovered these after making our registry, so they unfortunately didn\u2019t make the cut.\u201d $38 at Of A Kind Buy\n\nJohn Boos & Co. Maple Edge-Grain Cutting Board - 24\" x 18\" $100 (was $150, now 33% off) \u201cThis seemed like the sort of sensible item one might find on an adult\u2019s wedding registry. And it\u2019s nice to have a huge surface \u2014 we got the 24-by-18 inch \u2014 for whatever chopping needs arise. (Me, stone fruit; my husband, preserved lemon.) Only now I\u2019m figuring out the responsibilities of owning a nice cutting board; namely, you have to become a Cutting Board Person who keeps a well-mineral-oiled maintenance routine. Someday!\u201d $100 at Amazon Buy $100 at Amazon Buy\n\nHeath Ceramics Medium Covered Serving Dish \u201cHaving worked at Dwell and getting married to a man who grew up in the Bay Area, it would have been sacrilege to leave Heath off our registry. The Sausalito-based ceramics purveyor has been churning out reliably tasteful, modern porcelain and servingware since 1948. We picked this medium covered serving dish, which delights me every time I use it. The aqua shade is perfect: a soothing, unexpected color that doesn\u2019t overwhelm whatever else you\u2019ve got on the table.\u201d $120 at Heath Ceramics Buy\n\nSolido Rectangular Pizza Stone \u201cAnyone who\u2019s tasted it knows that my husband makes the absolute best pizza. (He starts with a no-knead dough recipe, for the curious.) It\u2019s one of the many ways in which he first wooed me! Anyway, we\u2019ve gone through a few subpar pizza stones and thought we should upgrade to this one, which is very sturdy and very well-reviewed.\u201d $70 at Amazon Buy $70 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe New England Trading Company The Original Colors of Maine Recycled Lobster Rope Doormat \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the latent prep in me who went to college in a coastal town, but I cannot resist these mats. They\u2019re made from recycled Maine float-rope so they\u2019re incredibly durable, and the colors vary for each since they\u2019re handmade from whatever old rope the company has handy.\u201d $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nNoguchi Akari Table Lamp Model 1N \u201cAkari Light Sculptures by Isamu Noguchi are nearly ubiquitous as an accessible design object, and for good reason: They\u2019re relatively well-priced and emit an irresistible glow. Noguchi \u2014 originally inspired by fishermen\u2019s lanterns \u2014 selected a manufacturer in Gifu, Japan, that was known for its umbrellas made of washi paper (which comes from mulberry bark) and bamboo. The lamps have been hand made by that same company since 1951. Appropriately, Curbed\u2019s architecture critic (and Noguchi expert) Alexandra Lange gifted this one to us,\u201d says Keith, who regularly writes about the latest trends and designs catching her eye in a newsletter for Curbed. $175 at The Noguchi Museum Shop Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
