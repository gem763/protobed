Crop tops with dragon motifs; puffa jackets; wide-legged trousers; camo; heavy chains; chokers...and that\u2019s just the clothing section. In homewares, you\u2019ll find disposable cameras, vinyl players, old-fashioned radios and even cassette tapes. As this decade \u2013 the 2010s, not the 90s or early 00s \u2013 draws to a close, looking back at some of mainstream culture\u2019s most defining moments drums up images that are eerily familiar. The generation growing up in the 2010s has chopped up earlier trends from every decade, including more niche styles like grunge, and made them their own. But how much truth is there to the idea that originality has completely died this decade?\n\nWhile all decades see some throwbacks, the 2010s seem unique: many have written about the nostalgic culture of the 2010s, with millennials being dubbed the \u201cnostalgia generation\u201d, and Vogue calling nostalgia the biggest trend in 2018. Culture tends to be cyclical, but what\u2019s perhaps different about the 2010s is that it appears to have had so little of its own \u2013 even the coolest e-girl and boy TikTok teens evoke images of the past, with backcombed coloured hair, and chokers.\n\nAway from fashion, the past decade has been an era of \u201creboot culture\u201d, with a massive uptick in the amount of recycled or spinoff material. In fact, nearly every single one of the highest grossing films this decade has been a remake or part of a franchise. Watching trailers in any given month over the last ten years may have made you feel like you were suffering from serious d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Many draw on older sources, but the MCU only really took off this decade after the success of 2008\u2019s Iron Man. It\u2019s down to $$$: studios know that the best way to get money is to hit an already secured audience. That means adaptations, reboots, and behemoth franchises. While some exceptions, like the recent Hustlers and rare original TV success stories like Fleabag, have proved that audiences still want original material\n\n, it simply isn\u2019t as dependable as churning out the same things audiences loved in the nineties and noughties, content that a new generation will love them just as much.\n\nThe gap between the first iteration of something and its comeback seems to have narrowed, too. For the most surprising example, we can look to alternative culture. The recent adoption of emo and scene by Gen Z kids has seen them picking up the style less than ten years after millennials dropped it. These once alternative trends have been dragged into the mainstream, too, with teenagers perfecting their cat eye and donning chokers to emulate a cleaned up version of the look. New emo bands often look like an uncanny valley version of artists we saw on Myspace a little over a decade ago. More innovative artists, like Lil Peep or Lil Uzi Vert, have chopped up aspects of the genre and melded it with rap and pop to create something new entirely; a controversial sound that older men turn themselves in circles calling \u201cnot real emo\u201d despite being imbued with all the emotion of an early Taking Back Sunday record. But the way new artists transform an old genre isn\u2019t indicative of a lack of originality; it\u2019s the opposite. They\u2019re utilising the internet to make something entirely new and share it for free.\n\nNostalgia is partly to blame, but it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Focusing on millennials, many of us are guilty of revisiting our pasts via 00s throwback nights, band anniversary tours, and \u201cremember this?\u201d posts on Twitter. Media outlets sell nostalgia back to us via anniversary pieces, forcing us to think about Friends over and over again. There\u2019s little room to grow; we don\u2019t need to discover anything new, as long as we can keep enjoying the things we\u2019ve always loved. With the massive shifts in digital culture, we have every era in history at our fingertips: nothing gets left behind.\n\nBut, why then, do teenagers adopt older culture? The answer could lie in that the one thing that has changed beyond recognition is our relationship to the internet. We have immediate access to aspects of culture we might otherwise have forgotten, which means that teenagers can discover eras they weren\u2019t even alive during. Sure, we could borrow our parents\u2019 80s albums or leather jacket, but Gen Z can pick and choose music, films and fashion from any decade they want without limits.\n\nOur past may be accessible, but conversely, it feels more distant because of the massive cultural and political shifts of recent years. Limitless news sources and a constant news cycle reminding us of Brexit, climate change, assault, and everything in-between means that we can consume more news in one day than we previously would in a week. We live in increasingly turbulent times, and it\u2019s no wonder, really, that even teenagers would rather cling to a simpler time before they were even born. Children don\u2019t have the option to remain ignorant to political shifts or climate change, and nostalgia for even the recent past speaks directly to a fear of our non-existent future.\n\nWhen the present is so terrifying and the future so unknowable, it\u2019s completely understandable to want to curl up in the past. Even a seemingly Tumblr-era obsession with film photography and vinyl can be explained this way: when we are so dependent on our phones, constantly told of the dangers and permanent alterations to our psyche that smartphones are having on us, why wouldn\u2019t we try to simplify our lives? A teenager taking a disposable camera on a day out might seem retro or faux-artsy, but dig a little deeper, and in many cases you\u2019re likely to find a fear of their present.\n\nThere are exceptions, of course, and the one thing that has changed is digital culture: through TikTok, Tumblr and Vine, teenagers this decade have completely shaped online culture and humour. Originality still exists, whatever the cynics may say, and the ability to take something old and make it new is a creative skill in itself. Our dependence on the internet is double-edged \u2013 it enables us to create and share new culture, if we choose to, but it also enables us to stay stuck in our pasts. It can amplify the voices of minorities and oppressed people who are rarely given a chance in mainstream media, as in the case of YouTube and Vine. Many of the \u201cnew\u201d cultural products of the 2010s were born directly out of digital culture \u2013 like Broad City, Insecure. How we use the tools we\u2019ve been given is up to us.\n\nPerhaps we are just too busy trying to fix the mistakes of the past to focus on new art. The climate crisis has imbued the latter half of the decade with fatalism; it\u2019s incredibly difficult to consider being creative when we\u2019re being told, daily, that the world is going to end. Young people are more politically engaged than ever. But what\u2019s next? The exhaustion with the internet that\u2019s been teased through the latter half of this decade is likely to reach a peak. More of us are checking our screentime and committing to digital detox breaks. If we manage it, that\u2019s likely to impact culture greatly. The climate crisis is likely to impact culture, too. With pressure being put on the fashion industry to focus on sustainability and crack down on fast fashion, the clothes we wear are likely to be different than in this decade.\n\nI spoke to Tora, aged 22, who works for streetwear website Hypebae. Tora loves to wear vintage clothes like the ones her mum used to wear, and she told me that she believes social media is the biggest reason for the recycling of older trends. \"Fashion spreads so quickly and it is easy to post and browse on apps like Instagram,\" Tora says. \"For example, if you\u2019re seeing your favourite influencer wearing a vintage Dior bag from the \u201890s, you\u2019ll probably look into getting that same bag,\u201d she says, adding that she believes it\u2019s also down to affordability and sustainability. \u201cGen Z is very nifty and have turned to thrift shops, vintage and secondhand places to shop, which has also created a higher demand for old and trendy pieces. Sustainability is a big reason as to why a lot of my friends actually dress very vintage-based, because a lot of Gen Z kids are realising the impact fashion has.\u201d\n\nEleanor, an 18-year-old ethical fashion blogger, agrees. \u201cGen Z are embracing fashion in a way that follows on from the principles and ideals of groups such as Extinction Rebellion. With the conversation of climate change and the rise in eco anxiety within the young, it is not surprising that there has been a rise in interest in sustainable fashion as both a cause and consequence of the activism which is positive,\u201d she tells me. \"It does create more of a sustainable cycle with clothes in the sense that trends are more likely to stem from second-hand clothing opposed to those high-street brands.\"\n\nWhile we have been guilty of recycling and revisiting old trends and cultural products in the 2010s, \u201cthe death of originality\u201d is ultimately a myth. Audre Lorde, who died long before this decade, once said: \u201cThere are no new ideas. There are only new ways of making them felt.\u201d All we can do is keep using the tools we\u2019ve been given to create what we can, while trying to save the world.\n\nPlus, logging off every once in a while won\u2019t hurt.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "As we head into the roaring 2020s, Y2k nostalgia is alive and well.
