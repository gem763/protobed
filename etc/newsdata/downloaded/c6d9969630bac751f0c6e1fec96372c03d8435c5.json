All cheese production must take place in the town of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, where the cheese has been made in the same vein for 1,000 years.\n\nWhile family producers still exist, around 70 per cent of genuine roquefort made according to \u201cprotected designation of origin\u201d, or PDO, rules is produced by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Caves, a brand owned by the world\u2019s biggest dairy group, Lactalis.\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 recently launched a cheese called bleu de brebis (Ewes\u2019 Blue) which uses pasteurised milk, is cheaper and milder in taste. It sports the same brand name and the green packaging is very similar to the original.", "description": "Defenders of genuine roquefort, France\u2019s famed salty blue cheese, have seen red over a cheaper, pasteurised lookalike they say is eating into already dwindling sales and which they want banned.", "authors": ["Henry Samuel", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000118727032-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxTaivgxss3kvj7s3o46ZqqlBLbGE_ZQKV04EIzdftTU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
