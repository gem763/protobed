Toon has worked on nuclear war scenarios for decades, and was part of the team that coined the term \"nuclear winter\" in the 1980s.\n\nThat's the term used to describe a period of extreme cold that could follow a large-scale nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia.\n\nUsing computer simulations, scientists theorized a war that could occur between India and Pakistan in 2025. The two countries, which both place a claim and have waged several wars over the Kashmir territory, could have a combined 400 to 500 nuclear weapons by then, up from about 300 today.\n\nEach weapon detonated could kill as many as 700,000 people, the study said.\n\nThe research also found that fires ignited by exploding nuclear weapons could release up to 36 million tons of soot (black carbon) in smoke that would rise into the upper atmosphere, spreading around the world within weeks.\n\nThis would block out sunlight, cooling the global surface by up to 9 degrees and reducing precipitation by as much as 30%, which would threaten food shortages and mass starvation around the world. The cooling could drop temperatures to levels not seen since the last Ice Age.\n\nThe study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances.\n\nIn a related editorial, Science Advances' deputy editor Kip Hodges said that now, unlike during the Cold War when only a few nations could start a nuclear war, nine countries possess a total of nearly 14,000 nuclear warheads.\n\nHodges said that when it comes to India and Pakistan, the deteriorating relationship between these neighboring countries puts south Asia \u2013 along with the rest of the world \u2013 at risk.\n\n\u201cNuclear weapons cannot be used in any rational scenario but could be used by accident or as a result of hacking, panic or deranged world leaders,\u201d Robock said. \u201cThe only way to prevent this is to eliminate them.\u201d\n\nToon said that \"hopefully, Pakistan and India will take note of this paper. But mostly, I'm concerned that Americans aren't informed about the consequences of nuclear war.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Nuclear war between India and Pakistan could kill up to 125 million", "description": "As many as 125 million people would die within days if India and Pakistan waged a nuclear war, according to a\u00a0scientific study released Wednesday.", "authors": ["Doyle Rice", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
