(Domenic Aquilina/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nTime after time, migrant rescue ships have arrived near the shores of Europe only to be left waiting at sea \u2014 sometimes for several weeks \u2014 as countries tussle over what to do with the people aboard.\n\nBut on Monday, four key European countries said they were trying to hash out a plan to end those standoffs, which have become symbolic of the continent\u2019s failures on migration.\n\nAfter a meeting in Malta, interior ministers from France, Germany, Italy and Malta said they\u2019d reached a temporary arrangement \u2014 a first step, they said \u2014 in which they\u2019d cooperate over the next few weeks to distribute newly arrived migrants. They\u2019d then work with other European countries, starting with an Oct. 8 meeting of the bloc\u2019s interior ministers, to broaden and formalize any deal and encourage more nations to take part.\n\nThere had been talk about each country committing to take in a set portion of migrants. But none of the four interior ministers provided specifics on Monday about how migrants would be distributed.\n\nThe meeting \u201cachieved progress with a blueprint that can serve as basis for redistribution of migrants,\u201d Joseph Muscat, Malta\u2019s prime minister, tweeted. \u201cIt is an important step but albeit just one step. Success depends on widespread endorsement.\u201d\n\nAny eventual deal would offer a workaround for the contentious E.U. requirement that migrants seek asylum in the country in which they arrive \u2014 a rule that places a disproportionate burden on Mediterranean countries. The requirement has contributed to their resistance against allowing boats to come to port while setting the stage for the ad hoc negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue like this,\u201d Dimitris Avramopoulos, a Greek politician and the European commissioner for migration, told reporters in Malta.\n\nBut the discussions about the management of new arrivals have been far from comprehensive. They have centered on new arrivals, not migrants who have already settled. They have not included countries with anti-migrant governments, such as Poland and Hungary, who are sure to resist being involved in any relocation scheme.\n\nAbove all, the discussions have focused on how to manage only one migration route, from Libya to Italy. This past year, though, far more asylum seekers have reached Europe by other sea routes: either departing Morocco for Spain or departing Turkey for Greece. In Greece, the rate of arrivals spiked recently as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to open the gates to more migrant crossings in a bid to gain financial support and political leverage in Syria.\n\nBut among the countries that met Monday in Malta, there has been an increased willingness to work together. Analysts say that is in large part because of political changes in Italy, where the country\u2019s anti-E.U. and migrant-bashing torchbearer, Matteo Salvini, recently lost his place as interior minister after fumbling a bid for more power. Italy\u2019s new governing coalition leans more to the left, and has signaled an interest in softening Salvini\u2019s stance and drawing closer to the European establishment.\n\nBefore Salvini became interior minister in June 2018, Italy had been the default landing spot for migrants rescued from flimsy dinghies in the Mediterranean. But Salvini promptly closed Italian ports to charity boats, and crafted laws to fine ship captains and owners who violated orders and entered territorial waters.\n\nIn the subsequent 16 months, numerous rescue boats have been caught in limbo at sea, sometimes while facing food and water shortages or other health risks. In one case in January, migrants spent 19 days at sea after their rescue. In another case, in June, a vessel was preventing from docking for more than two weeks, before the captain defied Italian orders and docked at the island of Lampedusa.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the fact that some states have decided to at least temporarily consider human rights at the EU\u2019s external border,\u201d a German rescue group, Sea-Watch, tweeted on Monday. \u201cOne thing is clear: The distribution of rescued people must be unconditional and take place ASAP in the nearest port of safety.\u201d\n\nStefano Pitrelli contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nDenied asylum, but not deported, migrants in Europe live in limbo\n\nItaly offers migrant ship passage to island port, softening its closed-door policy\n\nHow an obscure law professor outmaneuvered Italy\u2019s Trump to become prime minister twice\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The E.U. has never had a coordinated plan.", "authors": ["Chico Harlan", "Rome Bureau Chief Covering Southern Europe", "Sometimes Parts Beyond", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/w7c0NpqFe_z9V1MIo9T1vrGyquo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2LMM3AG6FUI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
