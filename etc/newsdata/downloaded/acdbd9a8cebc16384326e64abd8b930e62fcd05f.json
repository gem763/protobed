When the Court granted review, bells rang on both sides of the gun wars, because the justices had not agreed to hear a Second Amendment case in almost a decade. In 2008, the Court held, 5\u20134, that the Second Amendment protects a personal \u201cright to bear arms\u201d; two years later, it held, again 5\u20134, that this right applied against both federal and state governments. After that, the Court refused all pleas to consider gun cases, leaving the lower courts to test different local gun laws. By and large, local and state gun laws\u2014licensing, background checks, assault-weapon and large-capacity-magazine bans\u2014survived those challenges.\n\nBut then Justice Brett Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy. In an opinion while on the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh had proposed a radical approach that might shred most local gun laws. The New York case, it was thought, might be the one in which the new post-Trump Court revealed its Second Amendment cards.\n\nGarrett Epps: The Proud Boys\u2019 real target\n\nNew York\u2019s state and city governments went into overdrive. The City repealed the offending transportation limits; the state legislature passed a statute banning the City from ever adopting them again. New York then told the Court the changes rendered the case \u201cmoot\u201d\u2014that is, in effect over, because the plaintiffs had what they\u2019d asked for. The Court is supposed to dismiss moot cases, because there is no more \u201ccase or controversy\u201d for the Court to resolve.\n\nThe gun-rights advocates were incensed. This response from the Cato Institute in an amicus brief was typical: \u201cAmericans deserve clarity when it comes to abuses of their fundamental rights. This Court should not reward, in any way, Gotham\u2019s bad faith attempt to keep the law unclear at the expense of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoot for real or mootness as gamesmanship?\u201d the legendary Supreme Court correspondent Linda Greenhouse asked in The New York Times. \u201cMoot as in \u2018nothing left to argue about ever again\u2019 or moot as an example of \u2018voluntary cessation\u2019 that can be renounced at some future date?\u201d\n\nThe Court is scheduled to decide whether to go forward with the case on its first conference, on October 1.\n\nEnter five Democratic senators, who on August 12 filed an unusual (shall we say) amicus brief. Written by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, the brief pointed out what everyone already knew\u2014that the plaintiffs care less about out-of-state gun ranges in New York and more about \u201ca [Court] majority\u2019s help with their political \u2018project.\u2019\u201d (The other senators are Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii.)", "description": "A new guns case reveals that the once-noble institution has died, and we\u2019re left working with its corpse.", "authors": ["Garrett Epps", "Professor Of Constitutional Law At The University Of Baltimore"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/AP_19172426852558/facebook.jpg?1567287484"}
