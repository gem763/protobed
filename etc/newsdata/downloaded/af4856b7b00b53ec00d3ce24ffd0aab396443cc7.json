The only problem is her DNA test showed that she could possibly be the whitest person on the planet, and hardly a Native American at all. Turns out, she's a whopping 1/1,024th Cherokee Indian. PJ Media's Jim Treacher published a beautiful write up of this horrendous video Tuesday, wishing the 2020 Democratic hopeful a \"Happy One Year Anniversary\" post. Here's what he said:\n\nIt was Elizabeth Warren's moment of triumph! And it lasted for all of 3-4 hours. Then people actually read what was in the DNA test, and it wasn't at all what she claimed. If that test proved anything, it proved that Warren is white as hell. She's even whiter than me, and I can get a sunburn from watching Baywatch. She's as authentically Native American as a Redskins jersey, without the gravitas. Nevertheless, she persisted, and that enormous lie hasn't hurt Warren. One year later, she's gaining on Biden in the polls. She's still lying about stuff, of course, like whether she was ever fired for being pregnant. But it doesn't matter. The truth rarely does. If the journos decide she should be the Democratic Party's candidate for president in 2020, then they'll rationalize anything she says. They'll change the story from \"Democrat Brazenly Lies\" to \"Republicans Pounce on Democrat's Inadvertent Factual Error.\" They'll try to drag her across the finish line, just like they tried with Hillary. Who knows? Maybe it'll work this time.\n\nOthers like Katie wondered whether she would be questioned about her fake Native American heritage at Tuesday night's debate. She wasn't.\n\nOne year ago today, will anyone ask her about this at the debate tonight in honor of the anniversary? #DemDebate https://t.co/QLkDnpfHE6 \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) October 15, 2019\n\nBut, less than 24 hours after PJMedia's story -- the Warren campaign deleted the tweet!\n\nThe Warren campaign deleted it! ?? https://t.co/G1FzkYioTc \u2014 Huell Babineaux did nothing wrong (@jtLOL) October 16, 2019\n\nI tried looking up the video on YouTube, and it looks her campaign scrubbed it off the internet completely.\n\nI'm sure it exists somewhere. We'll update the story if we find it.\n\nIn the meantime, this Three Stooges episode, \"Whoops, I'm an Indian,\" will have to work to convey Warren's heritage:\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:50:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/151/9d0a40ae-5b68-463a-a49a-40c3aa9d99ed.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
