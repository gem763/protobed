He had spent a week in a municipal shelter without any medical assistance and was unable to walk or eat.\n\nThe poorly pup was also covered in a road rash, and he even carried a bullet in his body for a while after being shot.\n\nHe had been hit by a car and even shot by cruel owners (Picture: DallasDogRRR)\n\nDallas Dog RRR put out a desperate call for somebody to rehome Sandford before he was due to be put down.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t imagine the pain he has been in,\u2019 they wrote on Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But we are going to try to help him. PLEASE! Please help him\u2026 we need your help for this guy.\u2019\n\nIn the photos that the group posted alongside their pleading message, Sandford is slumped on the ground, or propped up against the wall \u2013 looking utterly desolate.\n\nHe was due to be put down unless someone came to his rescue (Picture: DallasDogRRR)\n\nSandford was checked by a vet and, luckily, none of his injuries were life-threatening, but you could still see the pain in his eyes.\n\nThe Facebook post amassed 1,500 shared and hundreds of comments, and finally, someone came forward to take Sandford in. The change in Sandford since then has been incredible.\n\nSandford was treated by a vet and taken to his new foster mom, Karen Velazquez. Since stepping paw into her house, he just hasn\u2019t stopped smiling.\n\nNow, Sandford has a loving foster mum (Picture: DallasDogRRR)\n\nHe is just delighted to be somewhere safe, warm and loving \u2013 and we literally couldn\u2019t be happier for him.\n\nBut, Sandford\u2019s story isn\u2019t quite over because he is still looking for his forever family as his foster mum Karen can only house him temporarily.\n\nHe\u2019s still looking for his forever home \u2013 but right now, he\u2019s very happy (Picture: DallasDogRRR)\n\nBut people commenting on Sandford\u2019s story on Facebook are trying to change her mind.\n\n\u2018I hope he can stay with you forever. He\u2019s a beautiful dog and you make him so happy,\u2019 wrote one person to Karen on Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Keep him. You are the one who made him happy,\u2019 added another.\n\n\u2018What a wonderful dog! I hope he can stay with you to spend his last years! It\u2019s great to see him so happy!\u2019 said someone else.\n\nBut, even if Karen is unable to keep Sandford longterm, it\u2019s fantastic to see that he is happy, healthy and loved right now. Hopefully, someone will come forward soon to give Sandford the forever home he deserves.\n\nMORE: Couple get married in a hospital room after the groom is rushed into brain surgery on their wedding day\n\nMORE: Newlyweds go straight from their wedding to McDonald\u2019s\n\nMORE: This man is running 12km every day to represent the number of men dying from suicide each week\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sandford was hit by a car, shot and left for dead - but his new foster family has turned his life around and helped him find his smile.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88948338_1570520099.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
