That was Trump\u2019s style.\u201d\n\nPence purports to believe that integrity is a function of one\u2019s daily habits and choices, and that character and ideals are the path to national renewal, yet he helped to elevate and continues to extol an erratic liar who insults the appearance of women, spreads conspiracy theories about rivals, and tweets in a manner that dishonors his office almost daily.\n\nThe logic of Trump\u2019s sexist attacks\n\nWhat\u2019s an earnest young Hillsdale undergrad who is even passingly familiar with Trump\u2019s character and past actions to make of Pence\u2019s selection as commencement speaker, his speech, or his broader work trying to elevate, empower, and lavishly extol a flagrantly immoral president?\n\nIf one of Pence\u2019s children or friends behaved as Trump has behaved, the vice president would be praying for the Lord to spare their immortal soul. Yet he still travels the country obsequiously praising the man.\n\nWhat are we to make of that?\n\nThe most charitable explanation is that Pence is engaged in what he believes to be a utilitarian moral compromise, wherein he helps to secure great power for a morally odious man with the expectation that the man will wield power in ways that wind up benefiting the greater good.\n\nIn this telling, Hillsdale students wanting to follow Pence\u2019s moral example might calculate who in their business career or civic life is most likely to bring about outcomes they find desirable and work to ally with and elevate that person\u2014even if he or she regularly lies, slanders rivals with conspiracy theories, praises murderous tyrants, disrespects his spouses and children, and professes religious faith only when it might benefit him or her.
