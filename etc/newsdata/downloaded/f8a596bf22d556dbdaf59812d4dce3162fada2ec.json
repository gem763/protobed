The company provides facial recognition and other AI technology to governments and companies including Alibaba, Ant Financial, Lenovo Group and Huawei.", "description": "Sources had previously told Reuters Megvii Technology's planned listing was scheduled for Hong Kong in the fourth quarter and might raise as much as $1 billion.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106096160-1566789108177gettyimages-1152274387.jpeg?v=1570582535", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
