He returned to the United States one Christmas and spent most of the holiday in bed recovering from malaria.\n\nAD\n\nLater digging in the dirt of San Lorenzo, near the Gulf of Mexico in Veracruz, Dr. Coe unearthed colossal stone heads and monuments left behind by the Olmec, a civilization he helped date, tracing its roots back more than 3,000 years. He also deciphered the meaning of cryptic Maya ceramics and writing symbols, or glyphs, and drew attention to a bark-paper document known as the Grolier Codex, generally considered one of only four surviving Maya manuscripts, or codices.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMike was one of the greatest archaeologists of the 20th century and a peerless popularizer of our field,\u201d said Stephen D. Houston, a fellow Maya scholar and chairman of the Brown University anthropology department.\n\nIn works such as \u201cMexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs\u201d (1962), \u201cThe Maya\u201d (1966) and \u201cBreaking the Maya Code\u201d (1992), Houston said, Dr. Coe \u201ccombined a fluency of expression with real learning and real accomplishment as a first-rank scholar on his own.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBased at Yale University for 34 years before retiring in 1994, Dr. Coe taught thousands of students and wrote for an audience that ranged from academics and armchair historians to archaeological junkies and tourists to Mexico. \u201cBreaking the Maya Code,\u201d which chronicled the years-long effort to crack the Maya script (a mammoth undertaking aided by Dr. Coe and his wife, Sophie D. Coe, a food historian trained as an anthropologist), was adapted into a popular 2008 documentary and inspired a \u201cNova\u201d program on public television.\n\nAD\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Cokie Roberts | Cokie Roberts, a journalist and political commentator who became one of the most prominent Washington broadcasters of her era and championed young women in media during a long career with NPR and ABC News, died Sept. 17 in Washington. She was 75. Read the obituary (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nHis early research also suggested that the Maya may have believed in an apocalyptic event at the end of their 5,125-year calendar cycle, in which \u201cArmageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation,\u201d according to Dr. Coe.\n\nThose lines, from his book \u201cThe Maya,\u201d contributed to a pop-culture sensation in 2012, when New Age mystics spoke of a \u201cMayan prophecy\u201d nearing fruition and hunkered down for the end of the world. Dr. Coe was said to have been mildly annoyed by all the fuss.\n\nAD\n\nComing of age in an era before most scholars were siloed in narrow academic disciplines, his work ranged far beyond the Maya: He was a scholar of Angkor Wat and the Khmer civilization in Southeast Asia, excavated a colonial-era fort near a farm he owned in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, and became a historian of fly-fishing, a hobby he pursued obsessively from Labrador to Siberia.\n\nAD\n\nFor a time, he accompanied his wife on trips to Europe, where she pored over 400-year-old texts while preparing a comprehensive history of chocolate. After Sophie was diagnosed with cancer in March 1994 (she died two months later), Dr. Coe promised to complete what became \u201cThe True History of Chocolate,\u201d and was listed as junior author when it was published in 1996.\n\n\u201cIt was the first book in the contemporary era, in English, that took chocolate as a serious field of study,\u201d said Carla D. Martin , a Harvard lecturer and the founder and executive director of the Fine Cacao and Chocolate Institute.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Coe was perhaps an unlikely candidate for scholarly work. Raised in wealth and privilege on the Gold Coast of Long Island, he was the great-grandson of Standard Oil executive Henry Huttleston Rogers, a builder of the Virginian Railway, where Dr. Coe\u2019s father was vice president.\n\nAD\n\nHe had initially planned to become a writer, studying English at Harvard before a visit to the Maya ruins of Chichen Itza steered him toward anthropology. Then a professor asked if he\u2019d like to \u201cwork for the government in a really interesting capacity\u201d \u2014 a suggestion that launched his brief career in the CIA.\n\nAccording to \u201cLegacy of Ashes,\u201d a history of the agency by journalist Tim Weiner, Dr. Coe adopted a pseudonym selected from a London phone book and was sent to Taiwan to join Western Enterprises, a front organization that aimed to subvert Mao\u2019s communist government in China. \u201cThe whole operation was a waste of time,\u201d Dr. Coe said. Within a few years he was back at Harvard, studying for his doctorate.\n\nAD\n\nIn a phone interview, his former Yale colleague Mary Miller recalled that Dr. Coe \u201cbrought to the table from the very beginning a kind of fearlessness about trying new techniques and looking for new ways to solve problems.\u201d He used a magnetometer to identify new monuments in San Lorenzo and championed an emerging approach known as ecological archaeology, studying the ways in which ancient peoples related to their environment.\n\nAD\n\nHe also risked his career in the 1960s to back the findings of Soviet linguist Yuri Knorozov, who argued \u2014 correctly \u2014 that the Maya writing system had a phonetic component. (Dr. Coe\u2019s wife, the daughter of noted Soviet-born geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky, translated many of Knorozov\u2019s writings from Russian into English.)\n\nIn the face of opposition from preeminent Maya scholar J. Eric S. Thompson, Dr. Coe threw his support to Knorozov and co-wrote a 1968 article in which he translated the glyph for cage, showing how it contained individual syllables.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a crystal-clear example that opened up how patterns could be studied to crack the code,\u201d said Miller, a Mesoamerican art historian and director of the Getty Research Institute.\n\nDr. Coe was also closely identified with the Grolier Codex, which was said to have been found in a cave near Tortuguero, Mexico, before being acquired by a collector and displayed at a 1971 art exhibition organized by the Grolier Club in Manhattan.\n\nAD\n\nScholars questioned its authenticity, with one declaring that its contents \u2014 almanacs of Venus \u2014 were so confusing as to \u201cmake any Maya priest tear his long hair.\u201d In an interview with the New York Times, Dr. Coe acknowledged that the document was \u201ca real hot potato\u201d but proclaimed that he would \u201cstake my professional reputation on it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIts survival, he added, was \u201cnothing less than a miracle.\u201d Three other Maya books were known to have survived through the centuries, and countless texts had been destroyed by conquistadors and Catholic priests.\n\nIn 2016, a team of Mayanists including Dr. Coe conducted an analysis that supported the Grolier Codex\u2019s authenticity. Two years later, researchers from Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology and History reached the same conclusion \u2014 triggering a celebration that Miller described as vindication for Dr. Coe and, in a sense, the ancient Maya.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome of their last words,\u201d she said, \u201cwould now be recognized and heard.\u201d\n\nMichael Douglas Coe was born in Manhattan on May 14, 1929. He grew up in Oyster Bay, N.Y., on a 400-acre family estate known as Planting Fields, now a state park.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Coe studied at St. Paul\u2019s preparatory school in Concord, N.H., before entering Harvard. Working in the anthropology lab one day, he found himself alongside a Radcliffe student, Sophie Dobzhansky, measuring the cranial capacity of skulls by filling them with mustard seeds. They married in 1955.\n\nDr. Coe received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1950 and a doctorate in 1959. For a time, he worked in the field alongside his older brother, archaeologist William R. Coe, who helped dig the Maya city of Tikal out of the Guatemalan jungle.\n\nThey suffered a falling out in the early 1960s and \u201cnever had anything else to do with each other,\u201d Andrew Coe said. The brothers rarely spoke about one another, although one colleague recalled in a tribute that William sometimes discussed an incident in which Dr. Coe \u201cleft him in a deep excavation trench\u201d during a dig in Belize. (William died in 2009.)\n\nAD\n\nDr. Coe joined the Yale faculty in 1960. He later chaired the anthropology department and was a curator at the school\u2019s Peabody Museum of Natural History, in addition to serving as an adviser to Dumbarton Oaks, a Washington research institute affiliated with Harvard.\n\nSurvivors include five children and six grandchildren.\n\nDr. Coe\u2019s many areas of expertise included the collapse of civilizations, and he sometimes noted that most lasted around 600 years \u2014 roughly the length of time since Western civilization flowered during the Renaissance. Environmental destruction and burgeoning population growth helped fell the Maya, he told the Guardian in 2008, and remained serious concerns across the planet.\n\n\u201cThe difference is we have a choice whether to let things get worse or fix them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what science is about. But it takes will on the part of those who govern and those who are being governed. To tell you the truth, I don\u2019t know if we have that.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries:\n\nSol Stein, best-selling author who published James Baldwin and Che Guevara, dies at 92\n\nJoseph C.
