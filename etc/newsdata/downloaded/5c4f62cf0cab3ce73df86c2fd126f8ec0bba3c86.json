Ron DeSantis called on President Donald Trump to include federal cash assistance for the communities that opened shelters as Hurricane Dorian threatened the state, telling POLITICO that leaving local governments to cover those expenses sends the wrong message.\n\n\u201cThat will lead them to say, \u2018next time, maybe we can skimp on that,\u2019\u201d DeSantis said after meeting with state Division of Emergency management employees in Tallahassee to thank them for their work over the past week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe White House has historically been reluctant to agree on covering shelter costs before a hurricane makes landfall but the governor, a staunch Trump ally, said he asked them to amend Florida\u2019s disaster declaration Wednesday night. In a letter to Trump, DeSantis asked the president to defray 75 percent of the shelter costs. He said he also spoke with Trump Wednesday night.\n\n\"He basically said we\u2019re going to help you out in any way you need,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nThe state was largely spared by Hurricane Dorian, but it still led counties and school districts along the Atlantic coast to open 115 shelters after DeSantis issued a disaster declaration on Aug. 28. Under that declaration, local governments are required to open shelters under state law.\n\nThe White House directed FEMA to provide the same limited amount of funding to South Carolina and North Carolina as those states brace for Dorian to hit over the next couple days. A review of the declarations approved by Trump over the past two years shows he later agrees to cover shelter costs after landfall. For instance, Trump expanded the scope of FEMA\u2019s recovery funding the day after Hurricane Michael hit the Panhandle on Oct. 10.\n\nThe difference with Dorian is that the storm never made landfall in Florida. But that should not prevent the White House from agreeing to help cover the shelters.\n\n\"They did what we asked them to do,\" DeSantis said of the local governments that took in evacuees.\n\nThis isn't the first time the White House has been reluctant to provide recovery funding.\n\nTrump all but turned away a request made by DeSantis and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) during a May 5 meeting in the Oval Office to increase recovery funding for Hurricane Michael after it was upgraded to a Category 5 storm. Trump later agreed to approve the increase after meeting with Gaetz and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) aboard Air Force One as they flew to a rally in Panama City a few days later.\n\nFEMA also agreed earlier this week to pick up the pace on approving recovery funding for the state by skipping a rarely used congressional review period. The period can stall funding by up to 40 days and members of Congress can use the time to alert constituents about the approval process.\n\nUnder the new agreement which FEMA finalized with the Florida Division of Emergency Management on Monday, the agency will allow funding requests of less than $1 million to skip the review.", "description": "The White House has historically been reluctant to agree on covering shelter costs before a hurricane makes landfall.", "authors": ["Arek Sarkissian"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/1c/b4baf7a242bbb731b6efaa1b25ea/desantishurricane.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
