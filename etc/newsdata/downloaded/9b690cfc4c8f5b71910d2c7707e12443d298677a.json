Just checked and daughters nativity is the Dec 12? #mummyproblems #politicalreporter #whodhaveguessed.'\n\nWhile another said: 'I had my youngest's Nativity show which will be shifted or cancelled as the school is a polling place.'\n\nAnd Andrew Smith said: 'Just checked - our local primary school, which our girls attended and has been our polling station for 30 years has its reception Nativity play on December 12.'\n\nLabour's sudden decision to back an election came less than 24 hours after Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Boris Johnson's demand to go to the country to resolve the Brexit standoff.\n\nTrying to put a brave face on the humiliating capitulation this morning, the Labour leader insisted his test of ruling out No Deal has been met. 'I can't wait to get out there on the streets,' he said.\n\nJohnson has said he is prepared for a 'tough' general election battle after MPs cleared the way for the first December poll in almost a century.\n\nFed-up voters used the Twitter hashtag #bahhumbug to moan about the political clash coming in middle of the festive season and the lead up to Christmas\n\nFollowing his Commons victory on Tuesday - at the fourth time of asking - the Prime Minister sought to rally Tory MPs telling them it was time to 'get Brexit done'.\n\nThe one-page Bill enabling the election to be held on December 12 now goes to the House of Lords, but it is unlikely to be held up in the unelected upper chamber.\n\nOnce it receives the royal assent, it will pave the way for Parliament to be dissolved on November 6 marking the start of the campaign in earnest.\n\nIn the end, the Bill passed the Commons by 438 votes to 20 - although a vote to alter the date, which Downing Street warned would scupper the whole thing, was much closer with a Government majority of just 20.\n\nThe Conservatives go into the campaign in buoyant mood, with one opinion poll at the weekend putting them 16 points ahead of Labour.\n\nAddressing his MPs at Westminster however, Mr Johnson cautioned against any complacency.\n\nThe Prime Minister's suggested date could clash with a number of already-scheduled nativity plays it has emerged, as disgruntled parents voice their concern online (above and below)\n\nAmong those concerned by the date is Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, who warned that December 12 is the latest possible date or the election would mean turfing pantomimes, parties and nativity plays out of village halls and schools used as polling stations\n\n'It's time for the country to come together, get Brexit done and go forward. It'll be a tough election and we are going to do the best we can,' he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister is aiming to restore the Tories' Commons majority lost by Theresa May in 2107 so he can finally end three years of deadlock and get his Brexit deal through Parliament.\n\nHowever, there are risks in going to the country having failed to deliver on his promise to deliver Brexit by October 31 'do or die' and with Nigel Farage's Brexit Party denouncing his deal with Brussels.\n\nA pre-Christmas poll means voter turnout likely to be depressed on the dark December nights while the Conservatives may also suffer at the ballot box if the NHS is hit by a winter flu crisis.\n\nJeremy Corbyn sought to strike an upbeat note, saying the election offered a 'once-in-generation' chance to transform the country.", "description": "Fed-up voters used the Twitter hashtag #bahhumbug to moan about the political clash coming in midst of Christmas parties and school nativity plays.", "authors": ["Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20370088-0-image-a-28_1572432701626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
