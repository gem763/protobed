Protesters have previously been hit with bean bags rounds and rubber bullets and officers have fired live rounds in the air.\n\nPolice chief Stephen Lo said the firing of live rounds - which were discharged in three places - was lawful and fair.\n\n\u201cPolice lives were under serious threat, that\u2019s why they fired live rounds,\u201d he told reporters, adding that the wounded man was conscious when taken to hospital.\n\nDramatic video footage of the Tsuen Wan shooting shows a chaotic melee with riot police battling protesters wielding metal bars, before an officer fires a shot at close range.\n\nAs the wounded man steps back and falls, someone tries to help, but another policeman tackles him to the ground.\n\nTuesday\u2019s violence was the most widespread since the unrest erupted in early June, plunging the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and posing the most serious popular challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power.\n\nProtesters had vowed to seize the opportunity on China\u2019s National Day to propel their calls for greater democracy onto the international stage, hijacking an occasion Beijing sees as an opportunity to showcase China\u2019s economic and military progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not young, but if we don\u2019t march now, we\u2019ll never have the chance to speak again, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said one marcher near Causeway Bay, a 42-year-old woman with her own logistics company who identified herself as Li.\n\nPOLICE BAN DEFIED\n\nSetting the scene for confrontations, thousands of black-clad protesters, some wearing Guy Fawkes masks, had marched on Admiralty, defying a police ban. Violence escalated across the harbour to Kowloon and beyond to the New Territories.\n\nIn the Admiralty area, police fired water cannon and volley after volley of tear gas to disperse protesters throwing Molotov cocktails outside central government offices and ordered the evacuation of the Legislative Council building next door.\n\nPetrol bombs were also thrown at MTR metro stations, including at Causeway Bay and Admiralty and Sham Shui Po in the New Territories. Many stations were closed to stop protesters moving around.\n\nChinese banks and Chinese-backed businesses were targeted with petrol bombs and anti-China graffiti. Local broadcaster RTHK said it was pulling all its reporters away from the violence after one was hit on the head.\n\nPolice said 31 people had been wounded across the territory, two critically, without giving details.\n\nProtester Jerry, 26, dressed in black and sitting amid the wreckage in Causeway Bay, denounced the police.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong police, they\u2019ve just lost their minds,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThey just follow orders. They say it\u2019s to protect lives, but they see the people as objects.\u201d\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab criticised the use of live ammunition.\n\n\u201cWhilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate, and only risks inflaming the situation,\u201d Raab said in a statement.\n\nRiot police run during a protest on China's National Day in Hong Kong, China October 1, 2019.

Roads to the centre were closed and tightly policed.\n\nHong Kong had benefited from China\u2019s support under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy, Acting Chief Executive Matthew Cheung told the assembly, referring to guarantees of political freedoms after the city\u2019s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nBut he said escalating violence was disrupting social order and hurting the economy.\n\nThe government of embattled leader Carrie Lam has already cancelled an annual Oct. 1 fireworks display over the city\u2019s Victoria Harbour, citing public safety.\n\nLam, who was trapped in a stadium for hours last week after attending the \u201copen dialogue\u201d, left for Beijing on Monday to celebrate China\u2019s birthday on the mainland.\n\nIn contrast to events in Hong Kong, Beijing\u2019s carefully choreographed anniversary festivities included troops marching through part of Tiananmen Square with new missiles and floats celebrating the country\u2019s technological prowess.\n\nLam was shown on television smiling as a float celebrating Hong Kong went past as she sat with Chinese officials.\n\nThe Communist Party leadership is determined to project an image of national strength and unity in the face of challenges including Hong Kong\u2019s unrest.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\n\u201cOn our journey forward, we must uphold the principles of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems; maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau ... and continue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification,\u201d Xi said in a nationally televised speech in Beijing.\n\nThe protests were initially triggered by a contentious extradition bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent from Hong Kong to mainland China for trial, but have since morphed into a much wider campaign.\n\nHong Kong protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in the Asian financial centre.\n\nChina dismisses the accusation and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of fanning anti-China sentiment.", "description": "Hong Kong police shot a teenage protester on Tuesday, the first to be hit by live ammunition in almost four months of unrest in the Chinese-ruled city, amid violent clashes on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435943805&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902RC", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
