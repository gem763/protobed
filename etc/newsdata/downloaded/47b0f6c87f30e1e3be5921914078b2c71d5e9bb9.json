Photo: Dominic Lipinski/PA Images via Getty Images\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have long defied the endless list of bizarre royal etiquette rules, to the extent that both of them have recently made headlines for \u2026 closing their own car doors. (I know.) But ahead of their big royal tour of Africa, the duke and duchess are really throwing caution to the wind, with the Daily Mail reporting that they have \u201cripped up the etiquette rule book.\u201d\n\nGoing into their ten-day trip across the continent, the duke and duchess of Sussex have made it explicitly clear that they don\u2019t want to be treated like, well, royalty, Vanity Fair reports. They want to come off as honorable but chill, in part to improve their popularity. Upon arrival in South Africa on Monday morning, Meghan and Prince Harry didn\u2019t walk down a red carpet, per tradition; instead, they headed straight to visit Justice Desk, an NGO in Cape Town that teaches classes on self-defense and empowerment to young girls. They want the public to know that they\u2019re in Africa to \u201cdo some serious work on the ground,\u201d per a source, and are not on \u201cvacation.\u201d And according to palace aides, Meghan and Prince Harry have even expressed interest in being \u201caddressed on first-name terms,\u201d in lieu of as \u201cyour royal highness,\u201d or sir or ma\u2019am. Speaking of the couple\u2019s rejection of formality, a source told Vanity Fair, \u201cIt\u2019s very much how they want things done.\u201d\n\nMeghan and Harry\u2019s brazen decision to reject formality, however, has made some officials nervous. \u201cI have no idea how to speak to them,\u201d Jacky Poking, secretary of the Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association, told South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times. \u201cWe haven\u2019t received any official brief on etiquette.\u201d To Poking, I would say, do not fret; Meghan and Harry \u2014 we\u2019re respecting their first-name-basis request \u2014 are cool royals.\n\nIt is unclear where baby Archie, who is also on tour, stands on following royal etiquette. We look forward to seeing if he takes after his unruly parents.\n\nStay in touch.
