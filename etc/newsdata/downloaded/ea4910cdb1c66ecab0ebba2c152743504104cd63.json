Major beneficiaries during the same period as the lawsuits included Imperial College London, the University of Sussex and Yale University.\n\nRockefeller University in New York accepted more money from the Sackler Foundation than any other school in recent history, more than $11 million, the bulk of which came from a 2014 gift of $10 million, according to the AP.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to all four universities highlighted in the report for comment.\n\nDr. Andrew Kolodny, a vocal critic of the Sacklers and leader of a Brandeis University program on opioid policy, said the donations represent an effort by the family to restore a reputation as pillars of philanthropy that has been harmed by their association with the crisis.\n\n\u201cMoney from the Sacklers should be understood as blood money,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cUniversities shouldn\u2019t take it, and universities that have taken it should give it back.\u201d\n\nVarious recipients of the Sacklers\u2019s charitable donations have distanced themselves from the family, particularly amid revelations in the lawsuits that many of the Sacklers were aware of the addictive properties of their products.\n\nThis year alone, the Louvre museum in Paris removed a plaque thanking the Sacklers for their donations and renamed the Sackler Wing of Oriental Antiquities, also covering other references to the family with gray tape, while the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York confirmed it will no longer accept donations from the family.\n\nMost of the schools would not tell the AP whether they would accept further donations from the Sacklers, while none said they plan to return the money, according to the AP.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at this through the lens of what people know now,\u201d Ross Cheit, chairman of the Rhode Island Ethics Commission and a professor at Brown University, which has accepted donations from the family, told the AP. \u201cMy sense is, during the time period we\u2019re talking about, people\u2019s views about that source of money changed a lot.\u201d", "description": "A number of colleges and universities have accepted at least $60 million in donations in the last five years from the family that owns OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma, according", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/oxycontin08172015getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
