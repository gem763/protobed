In over nine hours of movies, the only good bit is Smaug the dragon. So what went wrong?\n\nThe Everything In Middle Earth YouTube channel explores some of the reasons The Hobbit failed. In addition to nitpicking the film's artistic flaws (of which there are many) it also shines a light on the poor filmmaking decisions behind the scenes - from Jackson's initial reluctance to direct to the last-minute decision to split two movies into three.\n\nFair warning: the presentation is decidedly low-fi - it's basically a podcast interspersed with movie stills - but it does a pretty good job of explaining why Jackson's return to Middle Earth backfired spectacularly.\n\nFor a slicker and more detailed take, check out Lindsay Ellis' epic two-part evisceration below:", "description": "Last weekend, I attempted to re-watch Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy with my kids.
