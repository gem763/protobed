The online retailer, known for being a place where trendy women can buy anything from a $20 logo tee to a $2,000 Acne jacket, is turning 20 this month. To celebrate two decades in the business, Shopbop is going all out, launching a special clothing capsule and opening a physical pop-up in Soho jammed-packed with daily events for customers.\n\nCalled The Twenty, the capsule is an exclusive collection of 20 off-the-runway pieces from 20 of Shopbop\u2019s most beloved designers. Some of them are obvious Shopbop pieces, like Zimmermann\u2019s signature ruffled minidress in a fall floral print, or a cropped knit from Acne Studios in a decadent shade of blood red. But rounding out the selection are pieces from smaller designers: croc-embossed studded boots from Maryam Nassir Zadeh, crystal crochet earrings from the niche label Area, a leopard fleece from cult favorite brand Sandy Liang.
