He has said he would rather \"die in a ditch\" than do so.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sought to focus MPs' minds, saying Brussels can see no need to prolong the tortuous three-year Brexit process -- although the decision to delay, if requested by London, would be for EU leaders.\n\n\"There is no choice between Brexit or no Brexit: it's a choice between deal or no deal,\" Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said Friday.\n\n- 'This is our chance' -\n\nJohnson took office in July vowing to keep to the October 31 Brexit deadline, deal or no deal.\n\nHe pledged to renegotiate the most contentious elements of a divorce text agreed by his predecessor Theresa May with Brussels last year, which was rejected by MPs three times.\n\nThe compromise deal that was finally struck on Thursday has a new arrangement for keeping open the border between British Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.\n\n\"It looks like we are very close to the final stretch,\" EU Council President Donald Tusk said after the bloc's leaders endorsed the text.\n\nJohnson has assured his European counterparts that he can get the deal through the Commons, where he requires the support of 319 other MPs to guarantee backing.\n\n\"I'm very confident that when my colleagues in parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday, and then in succeeding days,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"This is our chance in the UK as democrats to get Brexit done, and come out on October 31.\"\n\n- Wooing Labour rebels -\n\nHowever, the DUP has said it cannot support the plans, as efforts to avoid checks on the Irish land border would lead to new trade barriers between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.\n\nThe main opposition Labour, Scottish National and Liberal Democrat parties are also against.\n\nThe pound had risen to five-month peaks on news of the deal.\n\nHowever sterling dipped about 0.1 percent against the dollar on Friday as investors continued to fret over Johnson's chances of success.\n\nJohnson will meet with and call MPs to try to win support for his deal throughout Friday, a Downing Street official said.\n\nWith the numbers extremely close, he needs to win over Labour MPs representing Brexit-supporting constituencies.\n\nThe Labour leadership objects to the new deal because it paves the way for looser ties between Britain and the EU than were previously envisaged. The party wants a second referendum on any deal.\n\n\"We should just vote the deal down because it's such a bad deal,\" Labour finance spokesman John McDonnell told BBC radio.\n\n\"It is a sell-out.\"\n\nBritain's eurosceptic newspapers backed Johnson's deal, which comes more than three years after Britons voted narrowly to leave the EU in a referendum that has left the country bitterly divided.\n\n\"Get real... take the deal!\" said The Sun's front page, while the Daily Mail went for \"He's done his duty. Now MPs must do theirs\", and the Daily Express said \"Just do it!\"\n\nMeanwhile the Financial Times called for a second referendum, while the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror said the best thing about Johnson's deal was that it was better than no deal.\n\nThe Times urged lawmakers to back the agreement, while The Daily Telegraph said parliament \"must not scupper this chance\".", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched a charm offensive on Friday to sell his Brexit deal to sceptical MPs, with a looming vote in parliament resting on a knife-edge.
