He can run inside or outside and is a special talent as a pass-catcher as well.\n\nThat being said, this is football \u2014 he can\u2019t do it alone.\n\nGiven the quarterback situation and the fact that the Giants have essentially zero downfield threats, defensive game plans will inevitably be geared towards stopping Saquon. Expect safeties to creep down and load the box.\n\nKoh Knows\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Barkley saw loaded boxes on about 23 percent of his carries last year, ranking around league average. I would expect that number to creep up, most likely north of 30%.\n\nAnd over the last three years, there have been 43 different times RBs saw eight-man boxes on at least 30% of their runs.\n\nOf those 43 instances, only one produced a top-5 RB finish in fantasy. If you\u2019re counting at home, that\u2019s about a 2% rate. Put another way, the numbers say there\u2019s about a 98% chance Saquon doesn\u2019t finish as a top-5 fantasy back.\n\nIn fact, only five out of those 43 times did a runner finish as a top 10 fantasy back, good for just an 11% clip.\n\nNow, I give you that Saquon is more talented. And maybe he somehow bucks this trend. But I\u2019ll gladly let someone else see if that is the case. I think he ends up just outside the top 10 at his position, much to the dismay of all the managers who took him with a top-2 pick.\n\nStory continues\n\nMIKE EVANS FINISHES AS A TOP-2 WR\n\nAs I go through all the numbers, the one player near the top of the draft that continues to stick out to me is Mike Evans.\n\nCurrently drafted in the late portions of the second round, it\u2019s time to give Big Mike some big props.\n\nLast year, Evans racked up 138 targets and the second-most air yards en route to a WR9 finish.\n\nWith DeSean Jackson and Adam Humphries gone, 179 targets and 2,046 air yards have been cleared from the books. Now, obviously a bulk of that will go Chris Godwin\u2019s way but still, I can easily see a scenario where Evans tops 160 targets and once again pushes past 2,000 air yards.\n\nIf we apply a 60% catch rate (career 55.1%, but caught 62.3% last season) and his career average 15.5 yards per reception, we\u2019re looking at a 95-ish catch season with about 1,500 yards. Touchdowns are always fickle but if he\u2019s on the positive side of chance, 10-12 touchdowns is a feasible goal.\n\nTYLER LOCKETT WILL BE A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT\n\nTurn away, Matt Harmon, but all the numbers tell us Lockett will almost assuredly be a bust at his current price in the middle of the fourth round.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Reference, Lockett caught 75% of his deep pass targets. It was the highest percentage among all pass-catchers who saw at least 10 such targets. The league average catch rate on deep passes is just 42.2%. Other notable players like Julio Jones (47.5), Tyreek Hill (44.9), Antonio Brown (38.8), Odell Beckham (45.7) saw catch rates well below Lockett\u2019s when it came to the deep ball.\n\nBottom line: The deep pass catch rate is utterly unsustainable.\n\nThe reason this matters? Well, 63% of his receiving yardage and 80% of his touchdowns came on these deep passes. If he comes back to around league average, a huge chunk of his production goes bye-bye.\n\nAnd I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cDoug Baldwin is gone, Lockett is going to see more volume!\u201d But is he though? How much meat is really on this bone?\n\nLockett saw just 70 targets last year, good for second on the team. The aforementioned Baldwin saw 73 targets, leading the team. As you can tell, this is a low-volume passing attack. The Seahawks threw the fewest pass attempts last year (just 427 attempts) and as you can deduce, they ran the ball a ton. As a matter of fact, as a percentage of their plays, Seattle ran the ball the most of any club.\n\nOf course, it is indeed likely that Lockett will improve on his target totals, but expect David Moore and second-round specimen DK Metcalf to eat into the 73 targets left behind by Baldwin as well.\n\nEven if Lockett pushes 90-100 targets, with his catch rate coming back to Earth this season, it\u2019s hard to see him return top-25 receiver production.\n\nJOSH ALLEN FINISHES AS A TOP-10 FANTASY QB\n\nAt a position that is absolutely loaded, I\u2019ll predict that Josh Allen somehow, someway, finishes as a top 10 signal-caller. I know, I know. It\u2019s the Bills. I get it, but just hear me out.\n\nLast year, Allen was on pace to rush for about 850 yards, providing him with an excellent floor.\n\nThe team also added speed merchant John Brown to the outside. His pairing with Robert Foster will help Allen do what he likes to do and that is chuck it deep.\n\nPer Next Gen Stats, his 11.0 air yards per pass attempt led the entire NFL last year. And similar to how air yards work for receivers, intended air yards for quarterbacks is part of the quarterback volume calculation. Instead of using targets and air yards, we use pass attempts and intended air yards.\n\nOver 11 starts, Allen threw 305 pass attempts, meaning throughout a 16-game slate, that\u2019s roughly 445 pass attempts. Not a ton, but given that he is looking to bomb out at every turn, some of those passes will connect for big yardage and long touchdowns.\n\nHe\u2019s not nearly as accurate, but from a pure volume standpoint, Allen compares favorably to Russell Wilson, who threw 427 pass attempts last year.\n\nWhen you figure in the rushing totals, Allen scored 18.4 fantasy points per game as a starter last year. That was as a rookie and without the services of John Brown, whom I believe will help him greatly.\n\nGuess what \u2026 if he could maintain 18.4 points per game over a 16-game slate, it would have been good enough to have been the QB10 last year.\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "It's the perfect time for some bold fantasy predictions.
