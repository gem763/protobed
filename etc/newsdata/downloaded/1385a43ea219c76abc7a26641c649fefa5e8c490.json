Charles Leclerc starts this race in pole position after an impressive qualifying. The 21-year-old Ferrari driver has now secured four successive poles and will hope for a victory at the Sochi circuit today. But he will likely face some stiff competition from Mercedes, who have won all five of the five races in Russia since in was introduced to the circuit. It was Leclerc's teammate Sebastian Vettel who controversially snatched victory in Singapore last week. Let's hope for a similarly dramatic race today. Advertisement Here's how the Drivers' Championship table looks ahead of this race. Mercedes are still way out in front and will be looking to extend their lead this afternoon. 1. Hamilton (Mercedes) - 296 pts 2. Bottas (Mercedes) - 231 pts 3. Leclerc (Ferrari) - 200 pts 4. Verstappen (Red Bull) - 200 pts 5. Vettel (Ferrari) - 194 pts Lewis Hamilton, who starts today in second, has emphasised the importance of getting off to a good start: \"It is a difficult one,\" he said. \"It is such a long straight. I am second. It is usually a bit dirtier on the right. Will he (Leclerc) cover and give me the tow? If he does, great. \"Will he stay in position and give Seb a tow and they both keep pulling past and we fall back to third? Will I be able to get a better start and then he'll pull away at some point? I don't know. \"There are so many scenarios. That's why starts are so great. It is about being on your toes. It is about picking up whatever ball drops and being the quickest to react.\" Leclerc on his chances of another victory: There is a long way to go and it is a good start. We have been competitive all weekend and the race simulation seems good too. \"It is going to be difficult to keep everyone behind, especially at the start, as it is a very long way to Turn Two but it was a very positive race run in P2 so that is a positive sign already.\" Advertisement Mercedes sack four employees over 'racist bullying' of Muslim colleague Mercedes appear to be approaching this race strategically, opting for the medium tyre, which is likely to prove more durable and last longer. Ferrari, meanwhile, have taken a risk with the soft tyre but, as Hamilton has pointed out, they have the speed advantage. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out. Hamilton is remaining cautious over his chances of another Championship win, despite his significant lead at the top of the standings. Lewis Hamilton: Mercedes will be underdogs for rest of Formula One season Advertisement Qualifying did not go entirely as planned for Red Bull. Verstappen was fourth fastest but a grid penalty for taking additional power unit elements means he's been pushed down to ninth in today's grid. His teammate Alexander Albon, meanwhile, crashed out of the first session and will begin the race way back in 19th. Red Bull, then, have a lot of ground to make up. Leclerc on his way to recording the fastest lap in Sochi yesterday Here's how today's full grid looks: 1. Charles Leclerc 2. Lewis Hamilton 3. Sebastian Vettel 4. Valtterri Bottas 5. Carlos Sainz Jnr 6. Nico Hulkenberg 7. Lando Norris 8. Romain Grosjean 9. Max Verstappen 10. Daniel Ricciardo 11. Sergio Perez 12. Antonio Giovinazzi 13. Kevin Magnussen 14. Lance Stroll 15. Kimi Raikkonnen 16. Pierre Gasly 17. George Russell 18. Robert Kubica 19. Daniil Kvyat - Alexander Albon Advertisement We're just 40 minutes away from lights out now... Leclerc has earned comparisons with Michael Schumacher for his performances of late, becoming the first driver since the legendary German to achieve four pole positions in a row. But the 21-year-old has played down the hype that has followed yesterday's qualifying. \"I don't want to think about those stats for now,\" he said. \"I just want to focus on the job.\" It's a home race for Daniil Kvyat today, but he'll start right at the back in his Toro Rosso.
