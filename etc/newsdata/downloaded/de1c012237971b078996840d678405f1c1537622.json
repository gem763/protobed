USA TODAY\n\nPopeyes made a long-awaited announcement on Monday that it's famed chicken sandwich \u2013 you know, the one that started the great Chicken Sandwich War of 2019 \u2013 is coming back Nov. 3, after selling out the first time in weeks.\n\nAnd the timing is perfect for mom Nidra Cummings and her 2-year-old son Nathan, who have won Halloween with their epic mommy-and-me Popeyes costumes.\n\nThe adorable duo teamed up to be the Popeyes chicken sandwich and Popeyes spokeswoman Annie, and Cummings shared photos to their joint Instagram page.\n\nThe costumes are handmade by crafty mom Cummings.\n\n\"I wanted something to match my son's personality,\" Cummings told USA TODAY, adding that her toddler has a big personality and is also a big fan of snacks and eating.\n\nNathan was in the NICU for a month after he was born and had surgery on his stomach at just 4 days old, the mom shared. She said that it was an \"uphill battle\" trying to get him to eat and that she was always worried he wasn't going to be able to.\n\nNidra Cummings wanted a costume that reflected her son's fun personality. Popeyes was it. (Photo: Courtesy Nidra Cummings)\n\nLuckily, the \"fun and funny\" boy is now a \"really good eater.\"\n\nIn fact, people are always surprised that her son will eat things like roasted broccoli and salmon, she said. So she knew his costume should be food-related.\n\nShe considered pizza, but decided that wasn't special enough, she said. Then the idea just \"popped into\" her head.\n\nThe chicken sandwich came together with help from two actual Popeyes boxes and felt fabric from the craft store for the sandwich elements, which she made \"authentic \u2013 no sesame seeds and just pickles and sauce.\"\n\nThe \"fried chicken\" look is corn flakes, glued on the sleeves of a shirt from Target.\n\nHalloween costumes: Easy and oh-so-adorable last-minute Halloween costumes for kids and babies\n\nIt's back: Popeyes announces return date of its chicken sandwich and takes a dig at Chick-fil-A\n\nCummings said the sleeves have held up well, but she may need to add more for Halloween night.\n\nSo, the big question is, does little Nathan like Popeyes chicken sandwiches?\n\nMom said he actually hasn't tried it because when she got one, it was the spicy version. But she said he does love Popeyes' biscuits.\n\n\"If we pull up to there (Popeyes), he's like, 'Biscuit mama! Biscuit mama!' He really likes their biscuits.\"\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/30/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-mom-and-son-halloween-costume/4095760002/", "description": "Nidra Cummings wanted a costume that reflected her 2-year-old's big personality.
