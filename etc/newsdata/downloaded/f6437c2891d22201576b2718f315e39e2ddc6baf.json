It also has a brand-new RF lens mount to go with it. All of these lenses have a control ring on them that can be customized to settings such as ISO, shutter speed, aperture, and more. But instead of having image stabilization integrated into the camera, like Sony, Canon builds stabilization into the lenses themselves.\n\nThe EOS R uses the same batteries as most of Canon\u2019s DSLR cameras, and it has a super similar button layout to them, too. It\u2019s clear this is Canon\u2019s blueprint for what is to come in a line of many more mirrorless cameras, including the already rumored EOS R series camera with an APS-C sensor. It\u2019s a great start to a pro-level mirrorless system, but its video abilities are lacking. The camera has a 1.8x crop in 4K, is limited to HD when shooting 120p, and there\u2019s lag when triggering the record button.\n\nI\u2019m hopeful this system is only going to get better, but for now I\u2019ll stick with my A7s II.", "description": "Canon has finally gotten serious about the high-end mirrorless camera market, so we had two Verge Video directors put the new EOS R to the test.", "authors": ["Becca Farsace", "Feb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AWI5qI-PNXcsKA_JeqcTW4ORcsU=/0x96:4932x2678/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13744686/eos_r_NO_TEXT__1_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-08"}
