The movement opens a new front in the fight against climate change that could affect everything from heating systems in skyscrapers to stoves in suburban homes.\n\nBerkeley, California, in July became the first U.S. city to pass an ordinance banning gas systems in new buildings, and it may soon be followed by many others, according to interviews with local officials, activists and industry groups. Los Angeles and Seattle are among those considering laws that could drastically reduce natural gas consumption.\n\n\"Berkeley is the opening salvo,\" said Bruce Nilles, managing director of think tank Rocky Mountain Institute\u2019s building electrification program.\n\nLocal officials and environmentalists cite mounting evidence that unburned gas leaking from pipes and compressor stations harms the climate more than carbon dioxide, the byproduct of burned fossil fuels.\n\nMany environmentalists until recently considered natural gas a \"bridge fuel\" to a future of renewable energy because gas burns cleaner than oil or coal. Now local officials are stepping into what they call a federal regulatory void under the administration of President Donald Trump, who argues fossil-fuel restrictions needlessly damage the economy.\n\nThey want buildings switched to electric power from a grid that is increasingly powered by renewable energy. U.S. utilities currently derive about 35% of their electricity from gas but have also nearly doubled their use of renewable fuels in the past decade, from 9% to 17% of all power, according to the EIA.\n\nResidential and commercial buildings account for about 12% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. They are also crucial to natural gas sales: Direct gas consumption amounted to about 8.45 trillion cubic feet in 2018, rivaling the 10.63 tcf used by utilities to power the grid, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n\nIf gas bans in buildings become widespread, they could upend the business models of some of the world's biggest energy companies, which are investing billions of dollars to produce and ship more natural gas on the belief the fuel will play a key role in the transition to a cleaner energy economy. Big gas producers including Exxon Mobil https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/Energy-and-environment/Energy-resources/Natural-gas <XOM.N>, Shell https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/natural-gas/providing-more-and-cleaner-energy.html <RDSa.L>, and BP https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/sustainability/climate-change/natural-gas.html <BP.N>, argue gas improves the environment by replacing dirtier fuels such as coal.\n\nNatural gas companies alarmed by the trend are pushing back with ad campaigns and research promoting gas as a superior cooking fuel and an affordable option in a country that has become the world\u2019s top gas producer.\n\n\"We are trying to get ahead of it,\" said Stuart Saulters, the Director of Government Affairs of the American Public Gas Association. \"We think there is a chance this can domino.\"\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, which represents the U.S. oil-and-gas industry, rejects claims that natural gas is bad for the environment, arguing its increased use has helped cut U.S. carbon emissions. Spokesman Reid Porter said that the industry is also limiting methane emissions with improved leak-prevention technology, citing data https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/ghgrp-petroleum-and-natural-gas-systems#2017-subsector from the Environmental Protection Agency showing a decline in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOS ANGELES, SEATTLE, MINNEAPOLIS RETHINK NATURAL GAS\n\nNilles, of the Rocky Mountain Institute, said some 50 California municipalities are studying new limits on natural gas in buildings, including Silicon Valley-area cities such as Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and San Jose, the nation\u2019s 10th most populous city. Los Angeles set a goal in April of powering all its buildings with renewable energy by 2050, starting with new buildings by 2030.\n\nSan Luis Obispo last week became the second city, after Berkeley, to pass a law limiting gas installations in new buildings. Kate Harrison, the Berkeley council member who spearheaded the city's gas ban, said she has been contacted by dozens of cities studying similar measures in states including Massachusetts and Minnesota.", "description": "WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dozens of cities in liberal-leaning states such as California, Washington, and Massachusetts are studying proposals to ban or limit the use of natural gas in commercial and residential buildings.
