Des Moines Register, Des Moines Register\n\nIn Iowa we will be hosting 2024 presidential candidates by December 2020. Here's one way to end the never-ending campaigns that fuel our divisions.\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Someone asked me the other day how soon potential 2024 presidential candidates would start showing up in Iowa after next year\u2019s election. The depressing answer, based on recent election cycles, is as early as November or December 2020.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida was the first 2016 candidate to set foot in Iowa after the 2012 election. He headlined a fundraiser just weeks after Election Day for then-Gov. Terry Branstad. In December 2016, at least one Democrat considered a potential 2020 presidential candidate attended a progressive interest-group event in Iowa. President-elect Donald Trump and Veep-elect Mike Pence showed up in Iowa for a \u201cthank you\u201d tour that same month.\n\nIowans, whose caucuses launch the national presidential primary season every four years, aren\u2019t alone in experiencing the perpetual campaign. Trump filed for reelection the day he took office and raised millions during his first year. It was one of the first of many departures from common practice: Barack Obama did not file for reelection until he had served two years in office.\n\nLong campaigns feed gridlock\n\nVoters and elected officials alike complain about the never-ending campaign, but we rarely hear anyone proposing to do something specific about it. After all, it benefits incumbents to pad their reelection bankroll before any challenger even thinks about running.\n\nThe length of the campaign also feeds into the hyperpartisanship and gridlock we see in Congress and the overwhelming power of special interest donors. That\u2019s one of the main reasons Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, is proposing a rule that federal elected officials must spend half of their terms actually governing.\n\nMontana Gov.

(Photo: Brian Powers/Des Moines Register)\n\nIn a plan Bullock unveiled last week, the president and members of the House and Senate would have to close their campaign fundraising accounts after each election, and they would be prohibited from raising campaign money for half of their terms.\n\nBullock, now in his second term, argues that elected officials don\u2019t have time to govern because they have to spend an average of four hours every day on the phone, raising money. \u201cThat time could actually be used attending committee hearings and floor sessions, which far too many of our elected members don\u2019t do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat time could be spent listening to concerns of constituents or \u2026 heaven forbid, building relationships with members of Congress, even members of the opposing party.\u201d\n\nMore time for pols to do their jobs\n\nBullock's approach is relatively simple: Require all candidates, win or lose, to close their campaign accounts after the election. Any money left after debts are paid could not be transferred to a new campaign committee. It instead would have to be either refunded or donated to charity or the presidential matching funds program. Or \u2014 get this \u2014 the money could be donated to the government for the purposes of deficit reduction. (Snort.)\n\nThe idea wouldn\u2019t stop would-be presidential candidates from showing up in Iowa years before the caucuses. They can always open their own issue-advocacy committees for travel to places like Iowa, or write a book and come here on tour. But it's likely to encourage elected officials to spend more of their time actually doing their jobs. And maybe we'd have to see fewer campaign ads on TV.\n\nGov. Bullock: I can win back the states Donald Trump took\n\nThe restrictions would also apply to challengers. The proposal would also prevent something that could be a more personal grudge for Bullock. Federal officials could not transfer campaign money for their current office into a campaign for another federal office, as many of Bullock\u2019s opponents for the Democratic presidential nomination have been able to do. You can read more details on Bullock's campaign website,\n\nBullock is among Democratic candidates who have proposed efforts to reverse the effects of the Citizens United ruling that allowed corporate campaign donations. He said that\u2019s also important, and he also wants to shine more light on \u201cdark money\u201d that benefits campaigns. But this plan would theoretically be easier than amending the Constitution and, he argued, might actually come as a relief to many lawmakers.\n\nCandidates are here, put them on spot\n\nBullock counters skepticism that lawmakers would agree to tie their own hands like this. He said some former U.S. senators, asked how they\u2019d like it if they couldn\u2019t raise money for the first few years in office, told him: \u201cBoy, that would change my ability to do my job.\u201d\n\nFundraising, apparently, isn\u2019t a favorite part of Bullock\u2019s job as a presidential candidate. \u201cAny candidate that just absolutely loves that should probably be unpacking that psychological suitcase right there,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nPatriotism contest: Take back the flag, 2020 Democrats. 'Liberty and justice for all' is a patriotic value.\n\nThe proposal comes at a time when Iowa voters can take advantage of their access to candidates. On behalf of the nation, we can press them to commit to closing their campaign committees for the first half of their terms. Because if we think it serves us to have our elected officials spending more time raising money than doing their job, we should be unpacking that psychological suitcase, too.\n\nKathie Obradovich is the Opinion editor for the Des Moines Register, where this column first appeared.
