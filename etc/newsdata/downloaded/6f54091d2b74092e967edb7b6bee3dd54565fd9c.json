I had a family history of diabetes and that was something I saw for myself if I continued on the path I was on. I really felt that I needed to address my diet, my exercise.\n\n\u201cAfter the death of my mum, because it was related to diabetes, it was really important to get myself sorted and not go down that same track. The way that I have dealt with my grief, this has given me a real focus, to focus on myself and get myself healthy rather than focusing on grief.\n\n\u201cBeing overweight made me feel that I had lost myself. I felt like a big person had eaten a small person. I started noticing results within two weeks. The weight started coming off, and once that happens you really get the motivation to keep going.\u201d\n\nThe family joined the Ultimate Performance gym in Manchester where former Emmerdale actress trains with \u201cEvil Steve\u201d - the man she credits with giving her her killer body.\n\n(Image: UP fitness)\n\nAs well as gruelling workouts, the McGillivray family\u2019s trainer Anthony Paulhe gave them nutrition plans and meal ideas which completed changed their attitude to food - and encouraged them to change their lifestyles for good.\n\nDad Roy, managing director of a dental firm, says: \u201cMy diet and lifestyle was probably pretty average. I was working hard. I wouldn\u2019t eat breakfast in the morning, I would have something mid-miring at work, fatty food, bacon and egg sandwich, sometimes I would take lunch, sometimes I wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIn the evening I would find myself eating takeaway food because I was too tired to prepare something. You may go to the pub after work for tea, but then you would end up having two or three drinks, so then you were consuming more alcohol. That was the lifestyle.\n\n\u201cI never realised how unhealthy I was until I had my measurements done. I had never considered myself to be obese - but I was obese.\n\n\u201cThat has got a bearing on your life. You reach a certain age, and if you allow your fitness levels to be poor and your diet to be unhealthy then you have to pay a price for that. If you look after yourself then age really is just a number.\n\n(Image: UP fitness)\n\n\u201cWhy would you not want to look in the mirror and see that person looking back is fit and healthy?\n\n\u201cI did this for myself and my family. But when people start to notice your transformation and make comments, you feel 10ft tall. When you go shopping and buy new clothes and they fit nice you feel good about yourself.\n\n\u201cI think the life-changing thing for me personally is taking the numbers away. I feel no different today at 56 than I did at 36, I probably feel better than I did at 36. To be able to say that is incredible. I think it has given me longevity, energy and focus.\u201d\n\nSue has lost so much weight that people who hadn\u2019t seen her for a while barely recognised her.\n\nAnd they all want to know the secret to her success.\n\n(Image: UP fitness)\n\n\u201cThe difference in me now compared to how I first started, I feel like a different person.,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel so much more confident, I feel like I have got back to who I am. I feel great. When you get dressed and people give you compliments it is nice, but ultimately it is how you feel in yourself, being able to look in the mirror and liking what you see. I am happy.\u201d\n\nAnd sons Ben and Simon are so proud of the changes their parents have made - and say training together brought out their competitive streaks and helped keep them all on track.\n\nSimon explains: \u201cThere has been competitiveness between us which I think gives you additional motivation. We have always done things together as a family but tow we have found healthier things to do - go for a healthy meal, or go bowling together. We still have quality time, but we make healthier choices.\n\n\u201cTraining together as a family has definitely brought us closer together. We have supported each other, there have been challenges along the way but we kept each other on track.\n\n\u201cThe change in my mum has been unbelievable. I hadn\u2019t realised how down she was. But the change in her over the course of the last six months has been incredible. I look at how she is now - she is enjoying life and that rubs off on the rest of the family.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Ultimate Performance visit upfitness.co.uk", "description": "The McGillivray family ditched pub visits and takeaways in favour of family gym sessions - with staggering results", "authors": ["Amanda Killelea", "Image", "Up Fitness"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584771.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_151019Slug_10933JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
