Strong or happy markets tend to have many common attributes while weak or 'unhappy' markets tend to have unique circumstances.\n\nThis general phenomenon has come to be known as the Anna Karenina Principle. The theory is that a successful endeavor or market is one that has avoided all major deficiencies. That is a common trait and is why all strong markets are somewhat similar.\n\nThe current unhappy market is unique in a number of ways. It is particularly unusual that the number of economists predicting a recession is at record levels. Normally when such a view is so well anticipated it is already discounted to a great degree, but in this market, the corrective action is still quite narrow.\n\nWhat is also different this time is the role of the central banks. It is unprecedented that interest rates were already so low as recessionary pressures become more apparent. The concern of the bears is that after a decade of interest-rate cuts the central bankers will be incapable of stopping the economic cycle this time.\n\nThere are many other unique circumstances about this unhappy market right now such as the U.S.-China trade issue, valuations, and the technical patterns. What I find particularly irksome about the market right now is the lack of good opportunities. Stocks are not beaten up enough for bargain hunting but the potential for bounce action is high.\n\nThe important issue right now is that this is clearly an unhappy market and it is struggling to find something to be happy about. It is not like other markets we have dealt with in the past and that means we need to proceed with a higher level of caution.", "description": "Why the current 'unhappy' stock market is unique in a number of ways.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "The Stock Market", "The Anna Karenina Principle", "Why The Current 'Unhappy' Market Is Unique In A Number Of Ways.", "Kevin Curran", "Bruce Kamich", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/d9ad4e43-ccd3-11e9-848d-f19313a5920c.jpg"}
