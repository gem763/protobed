Today is not that day.\u201d\n\nPerry\u2019s travels to Ukraine have drawn him into Democrats\u2019 focus in the impeachment inquiry, with Sen. Bob Menendez writing him a letter this week requesting information on his travels there, including a trip he led in May for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration.\n\n\"Given your role as the leader of the official United States delegation to the inauguration, and the White House\u2019s recent release of evidence that President Trump requested that Ukraine\u2019s government investigate his domestic political opponent, your insight into the U.S. delegation\u2019s trip is of particular interest to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,\" Menendez wrote.\n\nPerry frequently traveled to Eastern Europe to promote U.S. energy exports and was successful in pitching liquefied natural gas exports.\n\nPolitico\u2019s sources said Perry\u2019s decision had nothing to do with Ukraine, and had been in the works for months.\n\nDeputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who has reportedly been sitting in for Perry at Cabinet meetings lately, is expected to replace him, according to Politico.", "description": ".10/04/2019 8:29:12AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/256/d823031b-5353-4656-99d3-974a99f6461b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
