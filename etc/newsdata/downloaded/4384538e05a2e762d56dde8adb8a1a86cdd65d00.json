It\u2019s exciting,\u201d Mr. Spirk, also a Marine veteran, told reporter Hope Hodge Seck for an interview published Thursday.\n\nMr. Spirk was on hand at a Special Operations Policy Forum hosted by the New America think tank.\n\n\u201cWe want the machine to do the regression backward for us, and so it might pick up something extremely unique, [such as the made-up example] that we didn\u2019t realize every Marine Raider is from Arkansas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it would allow us to do is allow the machine to say, this is actually the series of things, that, when they come together, make this Marine Raider who made it all the way through successful.\u201d\n\nOfficials want to abandon the cumbersome and costly alternative of \u201cshowing up at a gym with a bunch of pamphlets and saying, \u2018Who wants to be a Raider today,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThe A.I., machine-learning and automation expert added that U.S. Army Special Operations Command is conducting similar experiments.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
