Paul Cook's seat will likely stay in GOP hands because of its conservative lean. | Pete Marovich/Getty Images 2020 elections California Republican Rep. Paul Cook won't seek reelection\n\nRepublican Rep. Paul Cook of California will not seek reelection in 2020, joining a parade of GOP retirements that has rattled the party over the last few weeks.\n\nCook, who represents one of California\u2019s most conservative congressional districts, will instead run for a seat on the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, his chief of staff said. The news was first reported by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe announcement comes the same day that President Donald Trump is making a fundraising swing through the state, with stops scheduled in Palo Alto, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nCook, a fourth-term lawmaker who serves on the House Armed Services and Natural Resources committees, was backed by Trump in his race last year against former Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a tea party favorite and co-founder of an anti-illegal immigration group that monitors the border\n\nThe GOP\u2019s once powerful California delegation has seen its ranks decimated in recent years.

Obernolte quickly rolled out a website announcing his run for Congress and touting the endorsements of a range of elected California Republicans, including Cook himself.\n\nDonnelly, the hard-line conservative who challenged Cook last cycle, is also another possible contender. Trump\u2019s decision to endorse Cook over Donnelly angered some conservative activists.\n\nWhile the district has long been Republican territory, Democrats are hoping they can add it to their list of competitive House races given that the GOP has a relatively slim four-point registration margin there.\n\nDemocrat Chris Bubser had already launched a campaign for the seat and outraised Cook in the second quarter of this year.\n\n", "description": "It's the latest GOP lawmaker to retire and another sign Republicans are not optimistic about taking back the House next year.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona", "Jeremy B.
