The U.K. is due to leave the EU on Oct. 31, but that date now looks uncertain after a majority of lawmakers voted to pass a law forcing the government to request a delay if a deal isn\u2019t struck with the EU.\n\nMuch of the predicted chaos stems from a huge traffic jam at ports on either side of the English Channel that would build up from day one, when the flow of trucks would drop by as much as 60%.\n\nThe document said significant disruption at ports in Dover, in the U.K., and Calais, France, could last up to six months. Trucks could face delays of up to 2\u00bd days as they line up for customs checks before boarding boats to cross the Channel. That could affect the flow of medicines into the country and spark panic buying of fuel. It could also push up the price of certain foods, the report said. Three-quarters of British medicines are imported through the narrow strait.\n\nBusinesses and households also would face higher electricity prices, the report said.\n\nRelated Video In the last two weeks, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suspended Parliament, unsuccessfully called for elections, and lost his majority.

The scenario the government describes is only if the government doesn\u2019t strike deals with individual EU countries to mitigate the effects of leaving the bloc and that the relationship with the EU is \u201cas a whole unsympathetic.\u201d\n\nThe report by the government\u2019s cabinet office warned that the impact of disruption would hit Britain\u2019s poorest hardest. It warned that \u201clow income groups will be disproportionately affected by any price rises in food and fuel.\u201d\n\nThe government has repeatedly delayed the publication of the report on the no-deal preparations known by the code name \u201cProject Yellow Hammer.\u201d\n\nBusinesses and economists have long warned of the threat to the British economy of suddenly breaking with the EU. Many businesses have stockpiled goods to prepare for any disruption to decades-old trade links with the rest of Europe.\n\nMr. Johnson has repeatedly said the U.K. must be able to threaten leaving without a deal to get improved divorce terms from the EU. He has tried to call an election to resolve the Brexit impasse, but his minority government doesn\u2019t have the votes to force a poll.\n\nBritain has already spent years preparing for a no-deal exit. The Bank of England recently softened its estimates over the effect of no-deal, saying it would shrink the economy by 5.5%, adding that preparation by the government has mitigated some of the worst effects.\n\nUnder the government\u2019s worst-case scenario, the country would overnight sever ties with the trade bloc, which would impose tariffs, animal-safety checks and other controls at borders for the first time in more than four decades.\n\nA major worry is that businesses and individuals aren\u2019t taking steps to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. The report estimated that between 50% and 85% of exporters using the Channel wouldn\u2019t be ready for customs checks on day one.\n\nBrexit has already been delayed twice and some businesses have expressed apathy at having to prepare yet again. The government has launched a large-scale ad campaign to raise awareness of the steps British people and companies need to take.\n\nFears of a no-deal Brexit, along with sluggish economic data, have weakened the pound, which has been trading around two-year lows against the dollar.\n\nThe government is looking to strike a deal with the EU at a summit in October, though there is skepticism that it has time to negotiate a revised deal and secure its passage through Parliament.\n\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com", "description": "The British government described potential shortages of fuel and medicines, long traffic jams at ports and rising food prices in a report.", "authors": ["Max Colchester", "Stephen Fidler", "Max.Colchester Wsj.Com", "Stephen.Fidler Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106312/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
