For the record I visit 4 states a week. In the last two it\u2019s been Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Massachusetts, Illinois, New York, and Georgia. If my columns stink it\u2019s not from lack of contact with Trump voters. \u2014 David Brooks (@nytdavidbrooks) October 5, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s your terrible opinions. \u2014 A.R. Moxon (Julius Goat) (@JuliusGoat) October 5, 2019\n\nEvergreen \ud83d\udc46 \u2014 Lisa Glass (@LMplusG) October 6, 2019\n\nIts your lack of talent and moral compass \u2014 homosexual rat fanta (@girlfoog) October 5, 2019\n\nwait you actually WORK to make content this bad Jesus Christ man \u2014 Patrick Blanchfield (@PatBlanchfield) October 5, 2019\n\nMaybe people have a hard time believing you because you make things up every other week and make many basic errors of interpretation on things we have all witnessed. \u2014 LiterallyAnscombe, Banquo of Your Online History (@LitAnscombe) October 5, 2019\n\nThat's a lot of traveling to still be extremely terrible at writing dude \u2014 Original Recipe Scrub (@ScrubOriginal) October 5, 2019\n\nStates aren't people. Land is not a person. \u2014 Randbrick (@HitherToFore) October 5, 2019\n\nDude, changing planes in Atlanta isn't visiting Georgia. \u2014 Nick (@getyrtrouserson) October 5, 2019\n\nHave you tried speaking to the Trump voters in Manhattan? Go to one of the buildings with his name on it. Or a bank. \u2014 Meghan McCain, Viewish American Princess (@norm_dagaire) October 5, 2019\n\nDavid I can assure you no one thinks that\u2019s why your columns stink. \u2014 Patrick Monahan (@pattymo) October 5, 2019\n\nit's true, that's not why your columns stink \u2014 i bless the rains down in castamere (@Chinchillazllla) October 5, 2019\n\nit's possible they stink because he's a bad writer \u2014 satanic panic! at the disco (@bendyhud) October 5, 2019\n\nSo instead of writing about the people you meet, you make up stories about us hicks in \"Flyover\" country. \u2014 Komrad Kowboy of the Iron Range (@Komrad_Iron) October 5, 2019\n\nSo why didn't you actually quote them? \u2014 Jon, but spooooooky (@JonIsAwesomest) October 5, 2019\n\nHis responses are so funny \u2013 like he's not willing to lie or directly engage with any critics, so he has to keep gently writing around the fact that he didn't interview any voters who said Flyover Man stuff. \u2014 Aaron Huertas (@aaronhuertas) October 5, 2019\n\nYour last column was an argument between two strawmen that posits people of color don\u2019t exist in \u201cflyover states\u201d and if they do, that their opinions matter less than whites. Resign your post and let someone with talent take it. \u2014 Premium Steve (@Premium_Steve) October 5, 2019\n\nIt was a parody of a terrible Brooks column. \u2014 Grudge of Whales (@grudging1) October 5, 2019\n\nI would have enjoyed the column more if you'd sat a ventriloquist dummy on your knee and acted out both parts. Or if you had a bunch of different dummies to represent Texas guy, Massachusetts guy, etc. Lot of accent work but you could take a class. \u2014 Bob Powers (@bobpowers1) October 5, 2019\n\nPlease stop. \u2014 Michael A. Brodeur (@MBrodeur) October 5, 2019\n\nDude you are the legit worst \u2014 Avery Wendell (@awendell98) October 5, 2019\n\nKeep digging, David. Curious to see how deep that hole can get \u2014 Matthew Hermann (@MatthewHermann) October 5, 2019\n\nHave you considered visiting either 3 or 5 states a week, perhaps that would provide you with the perfect balance of states for future columns \u2014 Andrew Rose Gregory (@arosegregory) October 5, 2019\n\nhow much can you learn about a state in 1.5 days? \u2014 Rebecca Schoenkopf, Wonkette Editrix, King Of You (@commiegirl1) October 7, 2019\n\nZero. He said he has *contact*, Rebecca, not that he listens, absorbs, or understands any of what he hears during his contact. If his column stinks, it's because every word of it was inapt, including \"and\" & \"the\". It was a David Brooks column after all. \u2014 Eliot Kieval (@kievaliant) October 7, 2019\n\nThat's not it, chief. \u2014 David Wiebe (@dwiebe99) October 5, 2019\n\nSurprised your recent spiritual awakening did not lead you to develop a less offensive name than Flyover Man for your dialogue partner. So insulting to so many \u2014 Mary Lee Brock (@MaryLee_Brock) October 5, 2019\n\nYou're right, there's plenty of other reasons they stink \u2014 A Frightening Amount of Mayo (@Dollop_of_Mayo) October 5, 2019\n\nIs it because you're just making things up? \u2014 Null_Nomenclature (@null_convention) October 5, 2019\n\nYou can admit it stunk. Everybody's saying it. join in. \u2014 Malcolm Willoughby (@MalcWilloughby) October 5, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "David Brooks visits four states a week, so that can't be why his columns stink.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/david-brooks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
