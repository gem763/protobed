If left untreated, the cancer will spread and symptoms are likely to worsen and have a greater impact on daily life.\n\nVictims include mother-of-three Joy Knott, who was initially treated for a chest infection \u2013 when in fact her lung had collapsed due to a tumour. She said: \u2018At no point in the year it took me to be diagnosed did anyone mention a possible link between my symptoms and my breast cancer having spread.\u2019\n\nThe study found four in ten felt their symptoms \u2013 including lumps, nausea, weight loss and severe pain \u2013 were not taken seriously when they first spoke to a doctor or nurse (stock image)\n\nJo Myatt, 44, was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in August 2016 following a number of visits to her GP over three years.\n\nShe said: \u2018It took at least five appointments with my GP before a blood test was arranged. I also saw a number of different specialists about these symptoms.\n\n\u2018By the time the cancer was found it had spread significantly... there were extensive tumours in my bones and liver, which had now started to fail. Had my secondary breast cancer been diagnosed sooner, I could have been able to access less invasive treatments and have more options. Throughout this ordeal, I was made to feel like a hypochondriac.\u2019\n\nCampaigners said women with primary breast cancer must be aware of potential symptoms of the disease returning and are calling for new resources for GPs to improve diagnosis.\n\nBaroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said the delays are \u2018completely unacceptable\u2019, adding: \u2018It is clear we need to provide better support to GPs and do much more to raise awareness of what secondary breast cancer is. We cannot let those with secondary breast cancer be written off.\u2019\n\nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u2018We understand the importance of timely diagnosis and are highly-trained to identify possible symptoms of cancer and its recurrence.\u2019\n\nThe NHS said: \u2018Breast cancer survival is at a record high and, thanks to huge advances in NHS care, the number of people dying from the disease is falling faster in this country than the rest of Europe.\u2019", "description": "Breast Cancer Now found patients with the disease have to battle 'avoidable' and 'unacceptable' delays to get a diagnosis.
