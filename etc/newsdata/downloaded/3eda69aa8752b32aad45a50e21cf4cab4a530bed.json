The company\u2019s quarterly results are expected to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.\n\n\n\nIn the last reported quarter, this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 2.52% in terms of FFO per share. Results mirrored growth in same-store net operating income (NOI). Further, it witnessed higher rental rates for both new and existing customers.\n\n\n\nOver the trailing four quarters, Extra Space Storage beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average positive beat being 1.70%. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nExtra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise\n\n\n\nExtra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise More\n\nExtra Space Storage Inc price-eps-surprise | Extra Space Storage Inc Quote\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\n\n\nFactors to Consider\n\n\n\nThe self-storage real estate industry is expected to have remained healthy in the quarter with stable demand. This is likely to have been backed by favorable demographic changes, the downsizing trend and an encouraging labor market. Moreover, increase in the number of people renting homes has escalated the needs of consumers to rent space at a storage facility to park their possessions.\n\n\n\nAmid these, with strategic presence in key cities, Extra Space Storage\u2019s efforts to expand its geographical footprint through accretive acquisitions and third-party management are anticipated to have been beneficial for its third-quarter results.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the self-storage sector remains an attractive asset class as it is basically need-based and recession-resilient in nature. The asset class\u2019 low capital-expenditure requirements and ability to generate high operating margins is anticipated to have buoyed the company\u2019s quarterly results.\n\n\n\nIn fact, management and franchise fees for the quarter are estimated to be around $11.87 million, indicating year-on-year growth of 17.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $282 million for property rental revenues suggests an improvement of 5.6% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure of $267 million.\n\n\n\nThese, in turn, will likely be conducive to the year-over-year revenue growth by 8.4%, with the top line pegged at $332.7 million for the quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, Extra Space Storage operates in a highly fragmented market in the United States, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. Further, with attractive opportunities in the industry, developers have flocked to this asset class, prompting a surge in development activity. This high supply is likely to have fueled competition for the company during the quarter, curbing its power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.\n\n\n\nAmid these, Extra Space Storage\u2019s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts\u2019 confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter FFO per share remained unchanged at $1.24 in a month\u2019s time. However, it indicates improvement of 3.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\n\n\nHere is what our quantitative model predicts:\n\n\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict a positive surprise in terms of FFO per share for Extra Space Storage this season.
