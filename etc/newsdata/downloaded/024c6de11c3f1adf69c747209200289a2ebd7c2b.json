This meaning doesn\u2019t match the facts in the landmark Federal Court decision against Myer. Back in 2014, former CEO Bernie Brooks told The Australian Financial Review\u2019s retail writer Sue Mitchell that Myer\u2019s profits would exceed the previous year\u2019s result. Myer has now been found guilty of breaching its disclosure obligations for failing to issue an update immediately it knew the forecast result would not be achieved. But here\u2019s the rub. Investors suffered no loss because the beady-eyed analysts discounted the talking-up of Myer\u2019s rosy outlook.\n\nThe wisdom of the market \u2013 which refused to be led by the nose \u2013 looks like it will save Myer from paying significant damages to litigious shareholders for losses that didn\u2019t happen. Nevertheless the Myer decision is significant because the courts have for the first time endorsed the so-called theory of market-based causation. Because the market efficiently prices information, market consensus is assumed to simplistically follow the release of information by companies such as profit projections.\n\nThe Federal Court decision makes class actions easier to run by ruling that plaintiffs therefore do not need to prove that individual shareholders relied on misleading information to make investment decisions. Market causation means that falls in share prices alone may be enough to find companies strictly liable for any losses suffered by any class action member who simply bought shares.\n\nThe Myer decision will further entrench the ambulance-chasing style litigation industry \u2013 an industry that since 2003 has generated 34 class actions settled at a cost to shareholders of more than $1.8 billion. The big winners will be the litigation funders and plaintiff law firms that will have a better chance of extracting favourable settlements. The big losers will be the shareholders forced to pay for the legal and settlement expenses of new claims, and for the anticipated jump in the already sky-high cost of liability insurance.\n\nStrong disclosure rules\n\nDeceptive corporate behaviour that deliberately misleads or manipulates the market must of course be punished. Australia already has very strong disclosure rules compared to equivalent US and UK laws that provide greater protections for market representations. But companies may now be less willing to be transparent and make forward-looking statements to avoid the risk of class actions. Will the market be better informed if the risk of shareholder-on-shareholder lawsuits increases? Director elections and remuneration report strikes already arm shareholders with the power to hold company management responsible for poor performance. Perhaps now is time to revisit the Australian Law Reform Commission review into shareholder class actions, which canvassed relaxing continuous disclosures to clip the ambulance-chasers\u2019 wings.\n\nMarket-solutions are generally preferable to legal ones. The motives of short-selling analysts that blindside companies may be questionable, as in the JCap ambush on the stretched market valuation of software company WiseTech. However, short sellers play an important corrective role in pricking the bubble of inflated prices before they get too far out of hand. Shorters also have real financial skin in the game, unlike lawyers who feed off the market. Robust market mechanisms are the best way to keep companies honest, not a litigious culture of second-guessing in hindsight by the courts.", "description": "The Federal Court's decision in the Myer case will make successful class actions far easier to run against companies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5539%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_49%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/380cc29770b6b74e3eea1a8f092728d900a20554", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
