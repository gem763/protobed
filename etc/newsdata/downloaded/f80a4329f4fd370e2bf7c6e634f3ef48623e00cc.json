I watched devoutly for several years as a kid, during the heyday of Hulkamania, and then I graduated elementary school and moved on. I hadn\u2019t seen so much as a single match in 20 years, not since my friends and I snuck a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon into the New Haven Coliseum to watch \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin, the Rock, and the rest of the gang tape the very first episode of WWE\u2019s Smackdown on my 21st birthday in 1999.\n\nNow it\u2019s September 2019, and I watch six hours of wrestling a week, easy \u2014 more if WWE or its newly minted rival AEW put on a special weekend pay-per-view event, and more still if I step into the time machine of the Internet and watch old rivalries I missed long ago. I recently spent a long Saturday night watching Ric Flair and Ricky \u201cThe Dragon\u201d Steamboat battle each other into oblivion in three separate matches from 1989, just because I\u2019d exhausted that week\u2019s options and wanted more, dammit.\n\nAnd more is what we\u2019ll all soon be getting.\n\nFor 20 years, the wrestling industry has been dominated by one person: Vince McMahon, CEO of WWE, by an order of magnitude the biggest player in the business. But now this 800-pound gorilla is facing genuine competition here in the States in the form of a new company, All Elite Wrestling.\n\nFunded by the billionaire owners of the Jacksonville Jaguars, AEW is run by a quartet of the world\u2019s best working wrestlers \u2014 including Cody Rhodes, son of WWE rival turned WWE employee Dusty Rhodes. Cody, an ex-WWE star himself, never got a fair shake in McMahonland; his colleagues at the top of AEW\u2019s pyramid \u2014 Kenny Omega and brothers Nick and Matt Jackson, collectively known as the Elite \u2014 have never worked for the industry behemoth at all, splitting their time between Japan and the American independent scene. We\u2019re talking bona fide new blood here.\n\nStarting this week, the two tribes go to war. Tonight marks the debut of NXT, WWE\u2019s acclaimed indie-flavored program, on the USA Network. It\u2019s the company\u2019s way of getting a jump on the competition: AEW launches its first-ever weekly show on TNT two weeks from now, on Wednesday, October 2. And two days after that, WWE\u2019s Smackdown debuts on its new network, Fox, bookending each weekend with the company\u2019s Raw broadcast Monday nights on USA.\n\nFans are calling this new burst of competition the Wednesday Night Wars \u2014 a return to the so-called \u201cMonday Night Wars\u201d of the \u201990s and early aughts, in which WWE slugged it out with the Ted Turner-backed wrestling promotion WCW for ratings and pop-culture supremacy. In fact, McMahon has hired two of his old rivals from the period, WCW honcho Eric Bischoff and \u201cExtreme Championship Wrestling\u201d visionary Paul Heyman, to oversee Smackdown and Raw respectively. Meanwhile, wrestlers themselves have begun routinely exchanging fire in interviews and in running Twitter battles between brands. It\u2019s like watching the Marvel versus DC war play out in miniature, with Spidey and Superman taking part in the hostilities directly \u2014 and I can\u2019t get enough.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re thinking what I would have thought if you\u2019d told me this just two years ago: What the hell?\n\nI mean, I\u2019ve got my media-consumption hands full. I\u2019m a full-time freelance critic who spends pretty much every free moment watching some show or movie or listening to some album or reading some comic I\u2019m getting paid to write about. I\u2019m a parent of two kids who have their own faves, for which I come along for the ride. My partner, the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met, is a cartoonist and aesthete, adding another set of artistic reference points for me to follow. I don\u2019t watch \u201creal\u201d sports, admittedly, but I play the occasional video game while high, and I think that counts.\n\nWhich is why I can tell you without fear of contradiction that wrestling \u2014 freaking professional wrestling \u2014 is as exciting and engrossing and life-affirming and generally excellent as all of the above. I enjoy it with a purity I didn\u2019t think possible. I think you might, too. Because here\u2019s the thing about being a wrestling fan today: 20 years\u2019 worth of advances in technology, representation, and pure athleticism have made the sport smarter, better, and more fun than ever before.\n\nLet\u2019s start in the ring, where wrestling ain\u2019t what it used to be \u2014 it\u2019s better than I ever imagined it could be. When I was a little kid in the \u201980s, watching Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant lumber around, whomping on each other, was the height of the wrestling experience for me. Today, dudes Hogan and Andre\u2019s size move with a speed and agility I didn\u2019t think possible, to the point where a random Monday-night fight between the towering \u201cMonster Among Men\u201d Braun Strowman and the musclebound Bobby Lashley would have been the stuff of elementary-school legend 30 years ago. They\u2019re not considered especially strong workers either, compared to the likes of the all-around masters like Kazuchika Okada or Will Ospreay or, well, literally dozens of other men and women in the field.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s been tremendous cross-pollination between different regional styles of wrestling, leading to an in-ring product that\u2019s more dynamic and offers more intriguing possibilities. Japan\u2019s hard-hitting \u201cstrong style\u201d and its British and European counterparts, the high-flying precision of Mexico\u2019s lucha libre and Japan\u2019s joshi women\u2019s style, the death-defying, anything-goes ethos of the American independent scene, WWE\u2019s sense of spectacle and showmanship: It\u2019s all gotten mixed up, along with the wrestlers themselves.\n\nThrow in the internet and companies\u2019 individual streaming services, and great match-ups between wrestlers the world over are more accessible than ever. If you want to watch former WWE star turned AEW rebel leader Jon Moxley terrorize his way through the peerless competitors of New Japan, or see highflying Irish heartthrob Finn B\u00e1lor tangle with (equally hot) Mexican heel Andrade in WWE, or watch AEW\u2019s \u201cElite\u201d core of Kenny Omega and the Young Bucks engage in synchronized aerial combat with masked men Pentagon, Rey Fenix, and the Laredo Kid, it\u2019s all at your fingertips.\n\nWhat you\u2019re looking at in the ring essentially shows the same jaw-dropping advances in athleticism as any other sport has over the past few decades. From basketball to track to figure skating, records keep getting broken and feats that would have once seemed superhuman are now routine. Watch Ricochet flip 630 degrees off the top rope to land on his opponent. Watch Kenny Omega and Kazuchika Okada wrestle an entire series of matches, including an hour-long draw and an hour-plus best-two-out-of-three-falls blockbuster, in which their energy level and ability to execute fast, high-risk maneuvers seemingly never flags. Watch Kairi Sane drop her \u201cInsane Elbow\u201d on her enemies from a height that would put even the great \u201cMacho Man\u201d Randy Savage to shame. It\u2019s fun to marvel at what the disciplined human body can accomplish, and that\u2019s as true in the squared circle as it is on the court or the ice.\n\nAnd if you want to move beyond the ring and get meta, a whole cottage industry awaits you. Say you like the industry gossip part of entertainment journalism \u2014 news about hirings, firings, changes in creative direction, studio rivalries, and so on. With pro wrestling, that\u2019s practically a sport unto itself, and the sheer quantity of information available on the internet has made playing along easy for everyone. Attempts to analyze the actions of McMahon, WWE\u2019s mercurial, politically conservative chief executive \u2014 who runs a multi-billion-dollar business but is still present at virtually every taping, micromanaging the shows and changing scripts on the fly \u2014 have risen to the level of kremlinology. And since the place leaks like a sieve, reports about backstage goings-on, like the level of creative control exerted by former rival promoters turned on-again off-again employees Heyman and Bischoff in their new top creative positions, flow like sweet, sweet wine. Ever tried to read the tea leaves of a Netflix press release, or figure out how AT&T is going to change HBO, or follow the escalating content wars between the megastudios\u2019 new streaming services? Get ready to flex those mental muscles on the daily.\n\nSpeaking of which, let\u2019s say you\u2019re the type of fan who\u2019s as into what hasn\u2019t happened in your favorite show or franchise yet as what has. You know the deal: You spent a year after Infinity War making predictions about Endgame; you\u2019ve been unraveling Big Little Lies since they were just normal-size lies; that sort of thing. Now normally, as a critic, that\u2019s the kind of stuff I try to stay away from; it\u2019s my job to talk about the stuff that\u2019s actually on screen, not the stories playing out in my head. In wrestling? All of that goes out the window. Just as it has with film and television, the rise of YouTube, podcasts, and social media have made speculation about wrestling a full-time obsession.\n\nI\u2019m not just talking about speculating as to whether the wrestler you\u2019re rooting for will win a given match or feud, either. Theories and predictions are the stuff of life in the grappling game, as fans and commentators (the lines between the two are blurrier than ever) take to Twitter, Reddit, and their podcast mics and feverishly try to determine which outcomes make the most sense for building up characters, pleasing the crowds, making faces look good and heels look scary or sleazy, and so on. It\u2019s not just who should win this match or this feud, it\u2019s who each combatant\u2019s next feud should be against, and who should win those, and what effect a win or loss might have on merchandise sales, and what the company in question ought to do to strengthen a particular character or build to a special pay-per-view event. It\u2019s a combination of the Westworld subreddit and fantasy football, in which what\u2019s likely to happen, what ought to happen, and what you wish would happen are all rolled into one.\n\nThen there\u2019s wrestling jargon, which has evolved into something of an art form unto itself. I\u2019ve already used a bunch of it in this piece, stuff that\u2019s become commonplace, as it\u2019s been passed down from the carnival circuit where \u201cprofessional wrestling\u201d originated \u2014 back when \u201ckayfabe,\u201d or the refusal to break character and admit this is a performance art in any way, was sometimes violently enforced \u2014 through our understanding of how all good-versus-evil narratives work. Faces, or babyfaces, are the good guys. Heels, their opposite, are the bad guys. Face turns and heel turns happen when one becomes the other.\n\nWhen heels get booed, they have heat; when faces get cheered, they get a pop; when they do something really easy to get either, it\u2019s cheap heat or a cheap pop. When you\u2019re really popular, or really hated if that\u2019s what your job is, you\u2019re over. A story beat is an angle. When something looks real but isn\u2019t, that\u2019s a work. When something looks real and is, that\u2019s a shoot. When something\u2019s supposed to look like a shoot but it\u2019s actually a work, that\u2019s a worked shoot. Rabid fans are marks. Rabid fans who think their knowledge of the stuff in this paragraph makes them better than the rest of the marks are smarks, or smart marks. Needless to say, the applications for this subcultural language in everything from pop music (Kanye turned heel!) to politics (when Republicans talk about civility it\u2019s a work, when Democrats talk about civility it is, sadly, a shoot) are endless.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve got a rooting interest in advancing social justice through the arts \u2014 which, by the way, you should \u2014 the endemic sexism and racism that plagued wrestling all the way through its boom years in the \u201980s and \u201990s is now largely a thing of the past. The two biggest stars in WWE right now are the Ghana-born daredevil Kofi Kingson, the company\u2019s second-ever black WWE Champion after Duane \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, and Becky Lynch, a hugely charismatic Irish woman. Both wrestlers made it to the top through sheer force of personality and fan goodwill, forcing their employer to adjust plans on the fly to accommodate their talent.\n\nGaybaiting gimmicks? Gone. Sexually fluid, Prince-referencing star the Velveteen Dream is hugely beloved in WWE\u2019s indie-style NXT brand, while lesbian wrester Sonya Deville fights her way up the women\u2019s roster with a rainbow flag in her back pocket. Transgender woman Nyla Rose is the top heel in AEW\u2019s women\u2019s division because of her furious physicality and for no other reason. When an old-school commentator took a shot at openly gay wrestler Sonny Kiss, the wrestling community had the performer\u2019s back, though if you can dance like this you probably have no problem holding things down on your own. Even xenophobic \u201cforeign menace\u201d heels are a thing of the past. No more Iron Shiek and Mr. Fuji \u2014 today wrestlers like Asuka and Shinsuke Nakamura are greeted like rock stars, and have their names pronounced correctly to boot.\n\nObviously billionaire-backed companies never have clean hands, and some of those hands are dirtier than others. But representation does matter, not only for wrestlers from marginalized groups who now have opportunities they\u2019ve been too long denied, but also for fans who want to enjoy the show without feeling actively insulted. In that regard, wrestling is no longer stuck in the past.\n\nWhich leads us to the biggest obstacle, both past and present, facing the appreciation of this art form: Is it fake? Well, yes \u2014 in the same sense that the ballerinas performing Swan Lake aren\u2019t really swans, or that no one on Game of Thrones actually ever rode a dragon. The difference between then and now is that the artifice is okay to talk about. You suspend your belief in order to get swept along by the story and the spectacle; then you step back and analyze that spectacle the way you would any art form. The skill involved, the stuff that makes a great dancer or great actor or great wrestler great, is very real, even if their pain, anger, grief, lust, and triumphs are largely feigned. A good storyline and a talented performer can induce you to suspend your disbelief way up past that top rope.\n\nNo, the combatants in a wrestling match aren\u2019t really trying to hurt each other. On the contrary: For a wrestling match to really work, the competitors must work together to make their rivalry look real. There\u2019s something beautiful in that, something I\u2019ve had a hard time articulating in my newfound ardor for the sport. But at the heart of it all, when I watch good wrestling, I see men and women who love their bodies, who love each other\u2019s bodies, and who love what they can do with them together. It\u2019s exactly like watching actors or dancers operate at peak condition. It\u2019s moving, sumptuous, often very silly, and just as often, absolutely glorious.", "description": "Twenty years\u2019 worth of advances have made professional wrestling smarter, better, and more fun than ever before \u2014 and with the upcoming Wednesday Night Wars between WWE and new rival AEW, fans are about to get more of it than ever.", "authors": ["Sean T.
