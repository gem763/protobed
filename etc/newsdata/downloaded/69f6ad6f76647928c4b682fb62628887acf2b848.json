By year's end, nearly every good imported from China will be taxed by the U.S. government \u2014 about $550 billion worth of total goods \u2014 paid for by American companies. Mr. Trump hiked the tariffs last month after China raised duties on $75 billion in U.S. goods amid an escalating trade war between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nU.S. employers hired 130,000 workers in August amid signs of slowing job-creation, leaving the jobless rate at 3.7%.\n\nTariffs on imported Chinese goods are paid for by U.S. companies, not China as President Donald Trump has erroneously claimed. In July alone, tariffs cost American businesses $6.8 billion, according to figures released Wednesday by Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a coalition of companies and trade associations that oppose the taxes. Rising trade uncertainty can hurt companies' ability to plan and hold back spending, which in turn can slow economic growth.\n\nU.S. economic growth, in the midst of a record expansion that has lasted for more than a decade, is starting to slow. The Congressional Budget Office this week forecast GDP of 2.3% for 2019, compared with 2.9% last year. The agency projects growth to slow to 1.8% in 2020, below historic averages.", "description": "Economist says the world's two biggest economies are engaged in a \"dangerous game of economic chicken\"", "authors": ["Rachel Layne"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/02/20/54fe12c7-a645-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/thumbnail/1200x630/a85087d09edf64d43bb1b47f7e1294df/china_US_flags_AP711544347140.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
