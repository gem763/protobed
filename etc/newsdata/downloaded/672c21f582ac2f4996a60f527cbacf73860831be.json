He became the first rookie with at least 300 yards passing, two touchdowns passing and two TDs rushing in a game since 1970 in the New York Giants\u2019 32-31 win at Tampa Bay.\n\nHis rushing scores may have been most impressive. Manning never had more than one rushing TD in any season and only had seven in 234 games.\n\nThe last quarterback for the Giants with at least two passing and two rushing touchdowns in a game was Charlie Conerly. He did it against the Boston Yankees on Nov. 28, 1948.\n\nJones isn\u2019t going to turn into Cam Newton or Michael Vick, but he\u2019s already shown more mobility than Manning.\n\nHere\u2019s a look inside more numbers entering Week 4:\n\nWORST TO FIRST: Four teams that missed the playoffs in 2018 are undefeated after three games. The Bills, Packers and 49ers are 3-0. The Lions are 2-0-1.\n\nMAGNIFICENT MAHOMES: Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is the first player with at least 350 yards passing, three TD passes and no interceptions in three consecutive games in NFL history.\n\nALL ABOUT THE D: The Patriots are the first team to not allow a TD passing or rushing in each of their first three games of a season in the Super Bowl era. They\u2019ve held their opponent scoreless in the first half in five straight games, including playoffs.\n\nNO OFFENSE: The Jets have scored two TDs on defense, one on special teams and only one on offense in the first three games.\n\nSACK MASTER: Buccaneers linebacker Shaquil Barrett had four sacks in a loss to the Giants. He has eight sacks already, tied with Mark Gastineau (1984) for the most by a player in his team\u2019s first three games of a season since 1982.\n\nDYNAMIC DALVIN: Vikings running back Dalvin Cook has recorded at least 100 yards rushing and a TD in each of his first three games of the season. His 375 yards rushing lead the league.\n\nCAM\u2019S BACKUP: Filling in for Newton, Panthers quarterback Kyle Allen tossed four TDs and posted a 144.4 passer rating in a win at Arizona. Allen had a 111.3 rating in his first career start in Week 17 last season.\n\nVERSATILTITY: Saints running back Alvin Kamara (23 TDs rushing and 10 TDs receiving) is the fifth player in league history with at least 20 and 10 in his first three seasons and Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey is the fourth player with at least 185 scrimmage yards and a TD in two of his team\u2019s first three games of a season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Call him Dual-Threat Danny.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/aptopix_giants_buccaneers_football_15487_c0-227-4687-2959_s1770x1032.jpg?6c7d2145b0edd3ef6ecaef5879bc17add0582189", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
