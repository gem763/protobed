It seemed an understanding had been reached between Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister), Leo Varadkar.\n\nNow there's lots of speculation, smoke and mirrors - but no sign of white smoke that a new Brexit deal is nigh.\n\n\"We felt last week that things would now move very quickly,\" one northern European diplomat told me. \"Now we realise we're still pretty far apart.\"\n\nImage copyright Press Association Image caption Realistically there is no time this week to work out a painstaking middle ground between the EU and UK positions\n\nReplacing the Irish backstop guarantee remains the main stumbling block in ongoing negotiations, particularly when it comes to customs.\n\nThe EU's dual priorities complicate things. Brussels wants:\n\nTo protect the Northern Ireland peace process - and big EU powers Germany and France say they're delighted the UK and Ireland are now talking about solutions To protect the EU's single market on the island of Ireland after Brexit, and here EU leaders think Boris Johnson's Brexit proposals don't go far enough\n\nThe European Commission says both sides - the EU and UK - are negotiating in good faith, but the not so secret EU hope right now is that time pressure and political pressure will build on Mr Johnson to such an extent this week, that he might yet blur some more of his red lines.\n\nThe EU thinking is that the UK prime minister is running out of options. He promised to do his best to deliver a new Brexit deal this week and he promised not to ask for another Brexit extension.\n\nWith so little time to go before the EU summit, Brussels believes the only option for a deal is for Mr Johnson to pivot towards an already set-to-go replacement for the current UK-wide Irish border backstop.\n\nAnd this is the EU's preferred option: a backstop that would see only Northern Ireland, not the rest of the UK, following EU customs rules after Brexit, while not affecting its territorial identity as part of the UK.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.\n\nNow for those who've followed the twists and turns of the Brexit process, you'll recognise the EU proposal as what was formally known as the Northern Ireland-only backstop.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson's offer is reminiscent of his predecessor Theresa May's Chequers plan for two customs systems (one EU, one UK) on the island of Ireland.\n\nEach proposal was roundly rejected by the other side.\n\nThe difference now is the political will to get a deal done. And not just in Downing Street.\n\nThose in the UK who claim the EU wants another Brexit extension to keep the UK in the bloc as long as possible are mistaken.\n\nEU leaders are fed up with the Brexit process. They want a deal.\n\nRealistically there is no time this week to work out a painstaking middle ground between the EU and UK positions.\n\nAnd EU leaders are adamant that they won't be negotiating directly with Boris Johnson at the summit.\n\nGermany, France and others say they want a Brexit deal they can live with, rather than something cobbled together in a rush to \"get it over with\" that could leave problems for the Northern Ireland peace process and/or the single market for years to come.\n\nWhile the technical details need to be ironed out (and that cannot be taken for granted), the EU political mood is determinedly more can-do now.\n\nIf the prime minister balks at doing a U-turn on a Northern Ireland-only backstop, despite being encouraged by still-to-be revealed EU sweeteners, then negotiations towards a hybrid solution will likely pick up again next week.\n\nFirst, though, all EU eyes would be on Westminster and the extraordinary session of Parliament on Saturday to see if another Brexit extension will be requested, or not.", "description": "EU leaders want a new deal, but it's hard to see how this can be agreed before this week's summit.", "authors": ["Katya Adler", "Europe Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5C5B/production/_109234632_a4880f19-d9b5-4a7f-8b7f-e0f716c1364a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
