The cases in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County are Rad et al v IAC/InterActiveCorp et al, No. 654038/2018, and Match Group Inc et al v Rad, No. 650287/2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown)", "description": "A New York state appeals court on Tuesday rejected IAC/InterActiveCorp's  bid to dismiss a $2 billion lawsuit by a group of Tinder founders, executives and early employees who said it undervalued the dating app to avoid paying them billions of dollars.
