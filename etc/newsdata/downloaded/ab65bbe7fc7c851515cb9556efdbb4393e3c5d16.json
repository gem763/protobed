In the fall of 2017, there were 16.8 million students enrolled in undergraduate programs, a 7% decrease from the total enrollment of 18.1 million in 2010.\n\nThe decline in college enrollment is attributable to a wide range of factors, including climbing tuition costs and the threat of a lifetime paying off student loans. The downward trend in interest in attending school is not universal, however, and some colleges and universities are reporting a surge in applicants.\n\nUsing data from the National Center for Education Statistics, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed five-year changes in the number of applications submitted to nearly 600 four-year post-secondary institutions to identify the 100 colleges where applications climbed the most.\n\n100.

Also from the NCES came annual price per school, which represents the cost of attendance, including in-district tuition and fees, books and supplies, on-campus room and board, and other campus expenses, for full-time, first-time degree-seeking undergraduate students living on campus. Acceptance rates were also calculated using NCES data. Total undergraduate enrollment also came from the NCES and is for the most recent available year.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
