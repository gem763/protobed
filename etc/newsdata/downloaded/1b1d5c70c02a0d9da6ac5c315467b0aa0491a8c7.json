That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re outraged, or motivated to Make a Difference. They\u2019re just tired. You can live inside the right-wing bubble in a state of depression, resigned to the fact that, yeah, every five minutes or so, the president is probably going to do something norm-shattering or potentially impeachable, and no, you probably won\u2019t or can\u2019t do anything to change that. Sad!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally bored by the story,\u201d one person who speaks regularly with the president told me. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to it. I already know all the details.\u201d This person is bored more generally, too \u2014 with the topic of Donald Trump. When we talk about what it would take for the president\u2019s defenders to turn on him, this crucial piece is missing: You can\u2019t feel outraged if you can no longer feel anything at all.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t that much different than the other crazy shit he\u2019s done in the last three years,\u201d the senior Republican Senate aide said. \u201cIn some ways, people are both pissed off about it but then it\u2019s also like, Are we gonna go crazy over this incident when we\u2019ve seen so much other stuff? Not to minimize the seriousness here, but what came out in the call transcript is not exactly shocking. If I were to describe Republicans one way, it would be weary.\n\nWeary and numb. It\u2019s been a long three years for Republicans on the Hill. Not to say we\u2019re the real victims \u2014 Yeah, start passing around the collection plate for us!\u201d\n\nFor the White House, impeachment is just another example of how it\u2019s been \u201cunder siege\u201d since day one. Early in the administration, in the golden age of the backbiting leakers, you were more likely to find dissent quietly simmering in the West Wing. But something shifted in year two, and whatever anyone thinks about the merits of the Ukraine story is almost beside the point. The point is the White House is a bunker and what Trump says goes. The White House and the Trump campaign have distributed what they\u2019re calling \u201cTEAM TRUMP TALKERS\u201d to congressional Republicans and surrogates, or to the people who go on cable TV to spin a story in favor of the president, and it\u2019s all par for the course: \u201cImpeachment has been the goal of Democrats before President Trump took office\u201d; \u201cSince Democrats have no chance at beating President Trump in 2020, they plan to undermine Democracy at the expense of the American people\u201d; \u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry is illegitimate and unconstitutional\u201d; \u201cPresident Trump made the unprecedented decision to release the transcript of the phone call with the Ukrainian President because he is the most transparent President in history\u201d; \u201cWe already know that the first whistleblower is a registered Democrat\u201d; \u201cThe whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge of the call between President Trump and the Ukrainian President.\u201d And, my personal favorite bullet point: \u201cThis is a total witch hunt scam.\u201d\n\nPhoto-Illustration: Joe Darrow.

I called up Newt Gingrich the other day, and it was like he was just reading directly from these emails, which suggest a strategy of partisan bullying and obfuscation. In other words, no real counterargument or legal defense to speak of.\n\n\u201cMy take is the White House ought to stonewall them totally, because they have no official standing,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cThis is clearly not an official action of the House. This is a partisan witch hunt by left-wing Democrats and, by the way \u2014 the first article about impeachment is Vanity Fair on December 15, 2016! The day that Trump was sworn in, on January 20, 2017, the Washington Post has an article on the efforts to begin the impeachment drive. So, any of us who are conservative think this whole thing is a partisan witch hunt and has no legal bearing and it\u2019s being handled very badly and it\u2019s going to lead to a fiasco when we get to the Senate.\u201d Before our conversation got derailed by his complaints about media bias, Gingrich, changing the subject from the quasi-legal matter of impeachment to the landscape of political futures, said, \u201cI think Trump will win potentially a landslide on a scale you can\u2019t imagine.\u201d And then he texted me at 2:21 a.m. to suggest I read a column by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Kimberley Strassel, whom the president loves.\n\n\u201cThe White House is just like, \u2018Oh, Trump will handle everything.\u2019 Which is crazy \u2014 but it seems like that\u2019s their strategy,\u201d the senior Repubican Senate aide told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a depressing time.\u201d\n\nI asked if anything would change for conservatives, if there was any significance in those predictable reports, like the one I\u2019m writing here, about how, privately, some of them feel bad, even if they never pipe up publicly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all bullshit until it\u2019s not. At this point, it is bullshit. Obviously it could change, but it hasn\u2019t. So who cares?\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
