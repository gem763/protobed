When I came to [consciousness] in the car, I noticed the windscreen was gone. I'd lost my glasses in the crash so everything was pretty blurry,' Mr Shannon told the Daily Telegraph.\n\nThe adrenaline kicked in immediately and Thomas quickly went into first-responder mode which he had learned through his volunteering in the Windellama Rural Fire Service.\n\nHe called out to his mother who didn't respond straight away but was heard murmuring moments later.\n\n'My neck was pinned between the roof of the car and the seat. I came to because Thomas was calling me,' Mrs Shannon recalled.\n\nThomas worked quickly to remove himself and his mother from the car after he smelled what he believed was petrol and burnt plastic.\n\n'He got out of the car, came to my side and managed to get the door open. He had to push on the seat hard to break it back so he could get me out,' Mrs Shannon said.\n\nThomas, who was a learner driver at the time, didn't see the oncoming danger and the car was sent smashing into a fence post and rolling on the ground\n\nThere was no phone reception in the remote location so Thomas requested a passing driver to stay with his mother while he went and got his father for help.\n\nMrs Shannon suffered knee, foot and facial injuries including the loss of 10 teeth and a huge gash on the top of her head.\n\nThomas suffered a fractured T11 vertebrae, something he only realised hours later when paramedics were assisting his mother.\n\nHis grandmother, Margaret Shannon, nominated Thomas for a Pride of Australia Award for his heroic act.\n\n'Thomas... is a very quite achiever showing care for everyone he helps and carries out his RFS duties with great thought well beyond his years. All the while doing his TAFE Course. He goes beyond the call of duty to protect the community he lives in,' she said.", "description": "Thomas Shannon and his mother Linda were driving home from the cinema in\u00a0Windellama in the Southern Tablelands of NSW, when they were suddenly confronted by flood water.", "authors": ["Mahnaz Angury For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/15/19334498-0-image-a-6_1570285068645.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
