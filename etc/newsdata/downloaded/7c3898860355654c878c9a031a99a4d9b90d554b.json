It trades at $1.2850 GBP=D3.\n\nGraphic: Sterling still cheap - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7712/7643/gbp.png\n\nYet any euphoria may not last beyond a few months, given the reality of navigating life outside the EU will soon set in especially against a backdrop of trade wars and slowing world growth.\n\nFocus will also likely turn to future trade ties with the EU once the transition period expires in Dec. 2020.\n\nBut for the time being investors seem ready to bet that the worst of the turmoil in the world's No.5 economy is drawing to a close.\n\nGraphic: UK stock market valuations cheap versus peers - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7672/7603/valuations.png\n\nUK-exposed shares are under-owned in portfolios and undervalued relative to peers - allocations to UK equities hit record lows of 7.46% last month, according to Copley Fund Research, which tracks more than 400 funds managing $800 billion in assets.\n\nBefore the referendum, allocations were around 9.2%.\n\nCompare also the amount of shares in the .FTMC that are out on loan, probably for shorting purposes - IHS Markit calculates the short loan value for the FTSE 250 at 1.63%, double the level for the .FTSE, an index with more exporters and international firms.\n\nThat's down however from highs around 2%, hit in early-2019 when no-deal Brexit looked plausible.\n\nGraphic: Short positions on UK stocks fall as Brexit nears - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7681/7612/shorts.png\n\nA 5% rise in the FTSE 250 is likely once the path and timing of Brexit is clarified, analysts canvassed by Reuters broadly expect, especially given earnings expectations for domestic firms have recovered from a near-decade lows earlier this year.\n\nBarclays (LON: ) advised clients to increase exposure to domestic companies, predicting they would benefit disproportionately. It also last week closed its long-held preference for UK-listed exporters.\n\nGraphic: FTSE 250 versus FTSE 100 earnings - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/7718/7649/Capture.png", "description": "Receding Brexit risks start to wash out billions of pounds of bearish bets against UK plc", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9M1EX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
