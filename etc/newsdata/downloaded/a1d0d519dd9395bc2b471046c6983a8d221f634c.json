(Baz Ratner/Reuters)\n\nThe World Health Organization accused Tanzanian authorities of withholding information about multiple suspected Ebola cases in that country over the course of this month, potentially hampering the containment of the deadly virus.\n\nThe statement was the international health body\u2019s most pointed rebuke toward any government yet during the current outbreak, which has ravaged nearby eastern Congo for more than a year and killed more than 2,000 people.\n\nThe WHO was made aware of the suspected cases of the virus shortly after one appeared in the east African country\u2019s massive capital city, Dar es Salaam, earlier this month. After that, however, the international health body was shut out of the testing of any blood samples and told by the Tanzanian government that Ebola had been ruled out.\n\nTanzanian authorities have not offered alternative diagnoses for the sickened patients.\n\n\u201cThe limited available official information from Tanzanian authorities represents a challenge,\u201d the WHO said in the statement. \u201cClinical data, results of the investigations, possible contacts and potential laboratory tests performed ... have not been communicated to WHO.\u201d\n\n[Ebola has spread for nearly a year in Congo. Officials are scrambling to \u2018reset\u2019 the response. ]\n\nThe WHO\u2019s statement refers in particular to a 34-year-old female doctor who was studying in central Uganda and returned to her native Tanzania with Ebola-like symptoms before dying in Dar es Salaam, Africa\u2019s fifth most populous city, on Sept. 8. Her illness was apparently contagious as numerous contacts of hers also become ill.\n\nThe WHO said it had received \u201cunofficial reports\u201d that the woman had tested positive for Ebola but that one of her contacts in a different city had not. The WHO had received no information on a third possible case, also in the capital.\n\nThe ongoing Ebola outbreak is the world\u2019s second-worst but has largely remained confined to two provinces in eastern Congo since it began last August. Days with dozens of new cases have been regular over the past few months.\n\nA small number of Congolese who sought treatment in neighboring Uganda were confirmed to have the virus in that country, but otherwise the outbreak has not left Congo\u2019s borders.\n\nNevertheless, Ebola is a virus that can travel far before its symptoms \u2014 which include extreme fever, the vomiting of blood and bloody diarrhea \u2014 become apparent. The WHO has already followed up on potential cases in the current outbreak that traveled as far as Dubai and China. Contacts of any suspected cases must be quarantined to effectively prevent the virus\u2019 spread.\n\n[WHO declares Ebola in Congo to be emergency of \u2018international concern\u2019 ]\n\nTanzania has never had a case of Ebola. Tourism makes up a significant portion of the country\u2019s economy, and Ebola\u2019s presence there would likely lead to widespread trip cancellations.\n\nThe U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was in Congo last week to survey the Ebola response and prior to the WHO statement had urged Tanzania to meet its international obligations for transparency.\n\n\u201cWe call upon the government of Tanzania to comply with its obligation under the International Health Regulations immediately with transparent disclosure of information and full cooperation with the international health community to allow for independent verification as to the circumstances of that individual\u2019s death,\u201d Azar told reporters during a briefing.\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The World Health Organization pleaded for cooperation from the Tanzanian government and expressed particular concern about a doctor who died after falling sick with Ebola-like symptoms.", "authors": ["Max Bearak", "Africa Bureau Chief Based In Nairobi", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NfS6SLqjLtl2R8nHj_gRHQdpvTU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZRXVC7W5EEI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
