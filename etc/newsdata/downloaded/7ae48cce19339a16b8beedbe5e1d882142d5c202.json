Still others have an even more novel rationale for preferring America\u2019s government-owned rail monopoly over other, more reliable conveyances: the food.\n\nIt turns out, you see, that Amtrak doesn\u2019t only dish up the microwaved Hebrew National hot dogs and burnt coffee familiar to those of us who frequent the Northeast Corridor service that traverses the Boston to Washington megalopolis.\n\nOn longer routes \u2014 the Chicago to New Orleans line, for instance, and the New York to Miami node \u2014 Amtrak still offers a proper dining car, replete with white tablecloths, family-style dining, and steak cooked to order. But not for long. As of this week, Amtrak will end proper dining car service on several long-distance routes and instead offer pre-packaged meals. Passengers on higher fare tickets will still have access to a separate dining car, but gone will be the white linen tablecloths and general air of decadence.\n\nOn Twitter, Amtrak\u2019s few fans bemoaned the decision. Author Neil Gaiman said the dining car is \u201cpart of what [makes Amtrak] magical.\u201d Journalist Megan Messerly reported that the dining car was her \u201cfavorite part\u201d of a recent rail journey. (Though come to think of it, Ms. Messerly\u2019s comment could be interpreted in multiple ways: The Hebrew National hot dog was actually my favorite part of the 14-hour journey from Washington to New York!)\n\nAmtrak blames changing consumer tastes \u2014 and particularly those millennials \u2014 for the shift.\n\nThe rail service wants to \u201clure a younger generation of new riders \u2014 chiefly, millennials known to be always on the run,\u201d Washington\u2019s other newspaper reported.\n\nBut that\u2019s ludicrous: Nobody \u201con the run\u201d takes a multiday Amtrak journey.\n\nIn reality, Amtrak\u2019s decision is based on costs; kiboshing the dining car will save some $2 million a year, the rail service reckons. So what others see as a tragedy is in fact something altogether different: a good start.\n\nRichard Anderson took over as Amtrak\u2019s CEO in 2017. This was a very good sign for the ill-managed, money losing rail network. Mr. Anderson had just come off a remarkably successful tenure at Delta Air Lines. In Atlanta, he turned Delta from a perennial money loser into a highly profitable, operational dynamo. By the time he left, Delta was by far the country\u2019s most reliable airline, lapping the field with far fewer cancellations and delays than the competition. It also offers far better service than other U.S. carriers. Oh, and Mr. Anderson made a bunch of money for shareholders too, no easy feat in the famously cutthroat aviation industry.\n\nNow ensconced at Amtrak, Mr. Anderson is right to focus on paring back losses.\n\n\u201cAmtrak says it is profitable on the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston, where adjusted earnings were $524.1 million in fiscal 2018, including $318.8 million from the Acela express train. But the company lost more than $540 million on its 15 long-distance trains, which cover routes of 750 miles or more,\u201d The Wall Street Journal reported this year. In fact, in its near 50-year history, Amtrak has not once turned a profit.\n\nGiven Amtrak\u2019s high ticket prices, that means U.S. taxpayers have for decades subsidized what amounts to a luxury good accessible only to a small sliver of the U.S. population. Indeed, Mr. Anderson should consider going further than merely eliminating perks on money-losing long-distance routes, and considering ending some of them altogether.\n\nSure, Amtrak partisans will carp about such reforms; union leaders have already been vocal in their complaints that Mr. Anderson wants to \u201crun Amtrak like an airline.\u201d (Um, yes, that\u2019s the point.) But oddly enough, the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential front-runner, Joseph R. Biden, who famously loves Amtrak and used to commute on it daily between Washington and Wilmington, has been silent on the subject. Mr. Biden, of course, is running a largely content-free campaign, and his campaign ignored questions as to whether the former vice president will ever release a rail policy.\n\nThat\u2019s doubly odd considering rail policy is urgent at the moment. \u201cOverall Amtrak ridership has stagnated. At the same time, infrastructure challenges loom large, especially the stalemate around rebuilding Amtrak\u2019s North Hudson River tunnels into and out of New York City \u2026 In addition, a large portion of Amtrak\u2019s assets,\u201d says Robert Puentes, president and CEO of the Eno Center for Transportation, a think tank.\n\nIn other words, Richard Anderson is right to cut back unnecessary spending \u2014 especially with big challenges looming. Sorry, Neil Gaiman, but I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to eat hot dogs along with the rest of us.\n\n\u2022 Ethan Epstein is deputy opinion editor of The Washington Times.
