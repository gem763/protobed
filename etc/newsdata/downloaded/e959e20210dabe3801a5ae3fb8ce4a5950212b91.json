On Wednesday, the government refused.\n\nMPs had demanded emails and messages between nine government advisers, among them Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s top aide, and Nikki da Costa, the prime minister\u2019s head of legislative affairs.\n\nThey were trying to prove that Boris Johnson\u2019s reason for suspending parliament was to stop MPs debating Brexit \u2013 and was not, as ministers say, simply a routine move ahead of a Queen\u2019s Speech next month.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It would prove that Boris Johnson lied to MPs and the public about his real reason for proroguing parliament. But perhaps more seriously still, it would suggest he misled the Queen when he asked her to order the suspension.\n\nNo wonder, then, that ministers decried the attempt to have the messages published. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told those behind the move that it was \u201cunprecedented, inappropriate, and disproportionate\u201d. Releasing the correspondence would, he said, be illegal under data protection and human rights laws, and against the \u201cbasic principles of fairness\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The \u201chumble address\u201d motion passed by the Commons is legally binding, meaning ministers face being found in contempt of parliament if they do not comply with it. But parliament has, of course, already been suspended, meaning any contempt proceedings cannot be brought until MPs return \u2013 currently due to be in early October.\n\nA similar series of events played out last December, when Theresa May\u2019s government refused to publish the full legal advice given to ministers on the Brexit deal she had negotiated with Brussels. After the Commons decided that her government had acted in contempt of parliament, May eventually backed down.\n\nIt is safe to assume that Johnson will not. His government has already ridden roughshod over the constitution, suspending parliament, questioning the impartiality of judges, threatening to \u201csabotage\u201d legislation, and providing wildly contradictory information about crucial government documents on the risks of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn normal times, a government would fear being found to have acted in contempt of parliament \u2013 it would be a major blow, undermining the prime minister\u2019s credibility, the legitimacy of the government and the very constitutional norms by which the UK political system works. Now, it would be just another bump in the road.\n\nSo will the messages ever see the light of day? It looks highly unlikely. The government is adamant that it will not release them. Cummings himself has previously been found to be in contempt of parliament after refusing to give evidence to a select committee. The charge does not appear to be one that particularly bothers this administration.\n\nMPs could try to launch a legal challenge, but the courts are unlikely to intervene to adjudicate on a matter relating to parliamentary affairs rather than the law. Judges have previously been clear that questions of internal parliamentary processes are an issue for parliament, not the courts.\n\nMany in Westminster believe that this is all part of a No 10 strategy ahead of the election that is expected to take place later this year. The more Johnson is seen to take on the so-called establishment \u2013 especially parliament and the courts \u2013 the more he can portray himself as standing on the side of the public against an elite that, he will claim, is intent on trying to frustrate Brexit.\n\nWith many voters increasingly angry over parliament\u2019s failure to approve a Brexit deal, the prime minister\u2019s latest battle with MPs will not come as a concern to Tory strategists.\n\nMPs will inevitably continue to push for the correspondence to be released in a bid to reveal the discussions that led to Johnson taking the extraordinary step of suspending parliament. For all their efforts, we may simply never know for sure why he did so.", "description": "On Monday, the House of Commons passed a binding resolution ordering the government to release a tranche of internal messages relating to Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament.
