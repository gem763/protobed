It's perfect for a child's bedroom or playroom.\n\nWith fairytale-inspired, hand-drawn illustrations, and an inventive magnetic lining, Sian\u2019s dinosaur wallpaper wowed the celebrity panel of judges. Winners were chosen based on quality, creativity, utility, wow factor, personal story and branding.\n\n'The magnetic Dino wallpaper by Sian Zeng stood out for me as a clear winner as it\u2019s so original and imaginative,' said interior designer and fellow Etsy Design Awards judge, Sophie Robinson. 'It mixes surface pattern with play in a really clever way.'\n\nThe unique magnetic wallpaper is created in four stages. First you have to paste the magnet receptive liner to the wall, followed by the white lining paper, then the patterned wallpaper. Leave sufficient drying time between each stage and then finish up by sealing with varnish to protect your magnetic wallpaper.\n\n'Our paper encourages people to tell their own stories,' Sian explains. 'I really want them to interact with the wall and see what they come up with.'\n\nBUY NOW Magnetic Dino Wallpaper\n\nPhoto credit: Etsy More\n\nPhoto credit: Etsy More\n\nOther category winners, with sellers from the US, Greece, and Israel, were:\n\n\u2022 Creative Collaborations Winner: Custom mid-century doghouse by Alejandro and Sara Piju\u00e1n of Piju\u00e1n Design Workshop\n\n\u2022 Festive Celebrations Winner: Papercut wedding vow art by Naomi Shiek of Woodland Papercuts\n\n\u2022 Earth-Friendly Winner: Upcycled interchangeable sliders by Vicky Moudilou and Stam Guinis of Eating The Goober\n\n\u2022 Signature Style Winner: \u2018Rainbows and Butterflies\u2019 coat by Molly Goodall of Little Goodall\n\n\u2022 Inventive Decor Winner: \u2018The Sling\u2019 walnut and leather chair by Justin Nelson of Fernweh Woodworking\n\n'The creative heart of Etsy has always been our community of the most talented craftspeople and curators and with these awards we set out to find and recognise the very best of Etsy,' said Etsy Trend Expert and Etsy Design Awards judge, Dayna Isom Johnson.
