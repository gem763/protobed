Retail has been tough for investors in 2019. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (ticker: XRT) is up just over 6% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen nearly 19%. However, continuing issues for the sector, from fierce competition to the trade war, have done little to slow Costco \u2019s rise: The shares have jumped almost 46% in 2019. Last week, the company reported better-than-expected sales for August.\n\nWhat\u2019s new. That success comes with a price, and in the case of Costco , it is reflected in its valuation. The stock price is closing in on 35 times forward earnings.\n\nThat\u2019s at the crux of Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh\u2019s downgrade of the shares. He cut his rating from Outperform to Perform, although he added $5 to his price target, to $300. He now sees \u201cless upside for shares driven by the now even more premium valuation, potentially aggressive Street forecasts, and difficult compares especially in the second quarter.\u201d\n\nHe writes that on a forward price-to-earnings basis, as well as in terms of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, Costco (COST) is trading above prior peaks. His estimates for earnings per share for fiscal 2020 and 2021 are below the consensus among Wall Street analysts.\n\nLooking ahead. Parikh may have downgraded the shares, seeing less room for Costco to rise following its big 2019 rally, but he\u2019s still a fan of the stock. It has been a top pick for him since he assumed coverage just over a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe continue to view Costco as best positioned within our entire consumer staples/food retailing coverage,\u201d Parikh wrote. \u201cWhile we continue to view shares as a core holding for investors, we now find it difficult to put new money to work at these levels.\u201d\n\nHe writes that he\u2019s still upbeat about Costco\u2019s longer-term prospects, and believes a $10 to $15 special dividend could still be in the works. That leaves him closely watching for any declines in the stock, which would make him more upbeat once again.\n\nParikh isn\u2019t the only analyst concerned about Costco\u2019s valuation. Yet successful growth stories in retailing have been so scarce that plenty of investors have kept ponying up for the stock. The question is how high a price they\u2019re willing to pay for a company that has become a master discounter and safety play.\n\nStill, as he notes, pullbacks do happen, perhaps leading some to hope for another good but not good enough quarter on Oct. 3.\n\nWrite to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com", "description": "Costco is the best-positioned company in the world of consumer staples and food retailing, yet it is getting harder for the stock to make gains, according to Oppenheimer.", "authors": ["Teresa Rivas"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-78993/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
