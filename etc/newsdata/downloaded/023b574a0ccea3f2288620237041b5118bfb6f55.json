He is like any teenage boy and embarrasses easily so he just didn't visit the house,\" said the insider.\n\n\"He still saw his mum but wouldn't stay overnight because he just couldn't stand the mess.\n\n\"Junior also needed to get to school and Katie not driving meant it was more difficult to get around.\"\n\n(Image: mirror.co.uk)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nOn a previous episode of Katie's reality show, My Crazy Life, Junior was seen telling off his mum for being inappropriate.\n\nWhile Katie and her then-husband Kieran Hayler were clearing out two massive containers full of old stuff, Junior wasn't keen on some of the things he overheard.\n\nAs Kieran announced the container was full of \"plastic\" that would \"have to go in the skip\", Katie rubbed her body up and down, saying: \"Plastic but fantastic\", and Kieran squeezed her boobs.\n\nHe asked his mum: \"Do any parents do that in front of their children?\"\n\nKatie asked: \"Junior, what's weird?\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAnd he sarcastically responded: \"Oh, yeah, it's just normal for Kieran to go up to you and then just squeeze your boobs and go honk honk honk!\"\n\n\"Well, everyone squeezes my boobs,\" she said in her defence.\n\nKatie was this month handed a two-year driving ban for failing to tell police who was behind the wheel of her bright pink Range Rover when it was found crashed in a hedge after a boozy night out in October 2018.\n\nShe claimed in court a mystery male friend had been driving when they crashed but had sprinted off with the car key in his pocket before police arrived.\n\nThe mum of five was cleared of drink-driving but convicted of being drunk in charge of a motor car, banned for three months and told to pay a fine.", "description": "Junior Andre, son of Katie Price and Peter Andre, told fans he's been targeted by someone pretending to be him for nefarious purposes", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Instagram", "Mirror.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20632785.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Peter-Andre-whisks-Junior-and-Princess-off-on-luxury-holiday-to-Universal-Studios-in-Florida-as-Kati.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
