The piece, based on a book planned for publication this week, asserts that others including fellow classmates recalled hearing contemporary accounts of the incident and alleges there might have been another similar episode.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal hasn\u2019t independently confirmed the reporting. Justice Kavanaugh has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh declined to comment.\n\nFrom the Archives Demonstrators gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court to protest the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

During the confirmation process last year, the Ramirez allegation surfaced just ahead of a closely watched Senate hearing featuring a woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Justice Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when they were in high school. That accusation led to a one-week delay in Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation vote while the FBI investigated; he ultimately was confirmed by the Senate, 50-48.\n\nIn tweets Sunday, Mr. Trump called the latest report about Justice Kavanaugh \u201cmade up\u201d and said the \u201clies being told about him are unbelievable.\u201d He added: \u201cFalse Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201dd\n\nMeanwhile, a number of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates pointed to the new report to argue Justice Kavanaugh should be removed from office.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.), who drew national attention for her questioning of Justice Kavanaugh during the hearings, tweeted Sunday that Justice Kavanaugh \u201clied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people.\u201d She asserted that Justice Kavanaugh \u201cwas put on the Court through a sham process,\u201d declaring that \u201che must be impeached.\u201d\n\nIn her own tweet, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who also backs impeachment of Mr. Trump, said the Kavanaugh nomination \u201cwas rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him\u201d and called the new report disturbing. \u201cLike the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached,\u201d she said.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in a tweet about Justice Kavanaugh that he supports \u201cany appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the Democrats had tried to deny Justice Kavanaugh due process and the presumption of innocence. \u201cThe far left\u2019s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year\u2019s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate,\u201d he tweeted. He added: \u201cI look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nRemoving a justice from the Supreme Court would require impeachment by the Democratic-run House, followed by a conviction, by a supermajority vote, in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nMr. Trump and Mr. McConnell have made judicial nominations a top issue in this administration, seeing the courts as central to conservative priorities such as gun rights and issues such as religious freedom and abortion.\n\nWrite to Catherine Lucey at catherine.lucey@wsj.com", "description": "Political sparring over Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s October 2018 confirmation to the Supreme Court flared up Sunday following a fresh news report, with some Democratic candidates calling for his removal from the bench and President Trump defending his court pick.", "authors": ["Catherine Lucey", "Catherine.Lucey Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-95317/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
