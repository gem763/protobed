Photo: Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday, Gucci closed Milan Fashion Week with the crack of a whip.\n\nA sign at the entrance of the company\u2019s Milan headquarters, known as the Gucci Hub, hinted at what was to come: \u201cGucci Orgasmique.\u201d What could it mean? (Besides exactly what it means.) Nothing is ever simple when it comes to the mind of creative director Alessandro Michele. His notes \u2014 written by his professor boyfriend, Giovanni \u201cVanni\u201d Attili \u2014 often make heady references to Foucault, and his previous spring collection included dragons and severed heads. You wouldn\u2019t be blamed for letting your imagination wander. \u201cOrgasmique\u201d also isn\u2019t a word I would immediately use to describe Michele\u2019s aesthetic. We\u2019re talking about a guy who made librarian glasses cool. Could it really be that the era of sexy Gucci G-strings \u2014 last seen under Tom Ford in the \u201990s \u2014 is back?\n\nGucci spring 2020.

As the notes explained, this display was meant to illustrate the \u201cmicrophysics of powers\u201d that control our society, from institutions to devices to, yes, even brands like Gucci. We must resist, the notes continued. (One model in the show, Ayesha Tan-Jones, took this quite literally, scrawling \u201cmental health is not fashion\u201d on her hands in protest and displaying the words to the audience.)\n\nGucci recognized its own power in the notes, asking if brands enlightened their customers, or were really just a \u201crefined device of neoliberal government that ends up imposing a new normativity, turning freedom into a commodity and emancipation into a broken promise?\u201d Hmm! A lot for guests like Harmony Korine, Jared Leto, Sienna Miller, A$AP Rocky, Iggy Pop, Gucci Mane, and his wife, Keyshia Ka\u2019Oir, to chew on.\n\nThe opening of the Gucci spring 2020 show.

In the past, that might have meant buying a loud print or a furry loafer, but for spring 2020, the look was less about deliberate bad taste and more about kink, with leather whips and latex choker necklaces. Like last season, when Michele showed Hannibal Lecter masks, he\u2019s letting his darker, more twisted side show.\n\nAfter a full 20 straightjacket looks, the lights suddenly went out, as if there were a power outage at the Gucci Hub, and models scurried off. Then, the real show began. The first look was a long black maxi dress with a deep sheer neckline, expressing modesty and nudity at the same time. This was followed by librarian glasses with thick chain croakies, bedazzled lace slips, revealing cutouts, and even a cheeky leather pillow case for last-minute sleepovers. A$AP Rocky and Lou Doillon seemed pleased at the sight.\n\nGucci spring 2020.

There were still ruffled blouses and Mennonite shoulders, only this time they were fashioned out of see-through fabric and leather straps. Even the beauty looks were perverse, like fake eyelashes applied as eyebrows. In other words, it was not Tom Ford\u2013era Gucci, which was a more textbook definition of sexy \u2014 although, there was a G-string in the collection. Michele told Business of Fashion that he was inspired by the freedom enjoyed by designers like Ford and Miuccia Prada in the \u201990s. \u201cThe way Tom looked at sex was ambiguous,\u201d Michele said. \u201cIt was more like something pagan, and I was drawn to that perversity.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for us, sexuality is still considered a provocation in 2019, but for Michele, it was a genuinely new direction. Personally, I found the straightjacket opener to be clich\u00e9 and unnecessary, but enjoyed the collection overall. It read as both straightforward and freaky, and will no doubt sell just as well as his previous collections, if not better. Sales are not something Gucci has to worry about, but too much success can lead to over-saturation, and Michele himself was probably starting to get a bit bored. Maybe, as the show notes hinted, he\u2019s feeling choked by the demands of capitalism himself. Either way, a little kick in butt doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nPhoto: Jacopo Raule/Getty Images for Gucci", "description": "On Sunday, Gucci closed Milan Fashion Week with the crack of a whip. \u201cGucci Orgasmique\u201d read a sign at the entrance.
