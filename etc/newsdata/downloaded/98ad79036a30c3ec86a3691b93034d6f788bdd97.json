The Trump administration has approved work requirements in 10 states to date, and seven more are waiting that approval.\n\nMedicaid work requirements are atop the administration\u2019s health care agenda. Under ObamaCare, states were given the option to expand Medicaid to childless low-income adults who didn\u2019t previously qualify for the program.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults should work instead, and that Medicaid should be reserved for children, people who are pregnant, adults who are disabled and very-low income residents.\n\nOpponents of work requirements say the new rules don\u2019t do anything to improve public health and are instead designed to kick people out of the program.\n\nAccording to administration attorney Alisa Klein, conserving a state\u2019s \u201cfinite resources\u201d by having people get coverage from an employer or from the ObamaCare marketplace fulfills the objectives of the Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cIf you free up state Medicaid money, there\u2019s no question\u201d you have the option of providing additional coverage because of the savings, Klein said.\n\nDistrict Judge James Boasberg previously rejected the administration\u2019s approval of Kentucky\u2019s program, and blocked the implementation of the Arkansas program, after he said the administration ignored the fact that work requirements would result in tens or hundreds of thousands of people losing Medicaid coverage.\n\nThe appeals panel referred back to Boasberg\u2019s opinion numerous times. Judge Harry Edwards, who was appointed by President Carter, said Klein never addressed the central issue.\n\n\u201cThere are adverse effects. People are going to lose coverage. You haven\u2019t addressed that,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cYou can\u2019t point to other objectives. The principal objective [of Medicaid] is coverage.\u201d\n\nKlein said the objective is to help people get the education and job training they need to be self sufficient. She argued that people leaving the states\u2019 Medicaid programs are not necessarily losing coverage, because they could gain other sources of coverage later on.\n\n\u201cAny loss of coverage as a result of non-compliance must be weighed against the benefits Kentucky hopes to achieve,\u201d Klein argued.\n\nOver 18,000 people lost their Medicaid coverage in Arkansas in the five months the requirements were in effect before they were blocked by the court. Kentucky, meanwhile, estimated 95,000 adults would lose coverage.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it a priority to approve work requirements, and plaintiff\u2019s attorney Ian Gershengorn said that is a problem.\n\nThe objectives cited by the administration \u2014 like saving states money and helping improve quality of life \u2014 are \u201cnowhere to be found in the Medicaid statute,\u201d Gershengorn said.\n\nHe said administration officials have admitted they want to transform and restructure Medicaid to make it more like a welfare program.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t implement [work requirements] without considering the massive coverage losses,\u201d Gershengorn said. \u201cCoverage is the focus of the [law] and the government hasn\u2019t wrestled with that at all.\u201d", "description": "A federal appeals court on Friday repeatedly pressed a Trump administration attorney on whether the Department of Health and Human Services considered how many people would lose coverage if they were subjected to Me", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/healthcare_medicaid_022113getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
