Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2019\n\nMcAleenan\u2019s fit with the Trump administration was reportedly rocky from the start. He was quoted by The Washington Post in a story early this month that he was struggling to control the department among Trump\u2019s political appointees in senior roles.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,\u201d McAleenan told the Post. \u201cThat\u2019s uncomfortable, as the accountable senior figure.\u201d\n\nThe Post described him as increasingly isolated and overshadowed by others more \u201ceffusive\u201d in their praise of Trump.\n\nHe was never formally nominated for the job.\n\nMcAleenan thanked the president in a tweet Friday for the \u201copportunity to serve alongside the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d He said with Trump\u2019s support, \u201cwe have made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis we faced this year.\u201d\n\nIn a longer attached statement, he cited success in reducing unlawful crossings, partnering with other governments to \u201ccounter\u201d human smugglers and \u201caddress the causes of migration.\u201d He vowed to cooperate in a \u201csmooth transition.\u201d\n\nI want to thank the President for the opportunity to serve alongside the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security.
