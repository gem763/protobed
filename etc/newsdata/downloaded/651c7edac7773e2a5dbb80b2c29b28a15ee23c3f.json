Unbelievably, I wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d he wrote.\n\n(1/4) Ten weeks ago I said on here that I\u2019d started writing a disco concept album about Brexit. Unbelievably, I wasn\u2019t joking. Even more unbelievably, it\u2019s finished, and it\u2019s released today.

We can go WTO!\u201d from Let\u2019s Go WTO, and \u201cCan we have another plus? It would be so great for us\u201d from Canada Plus.\n\nBut which tracks are people playing on repeat?\n\n\u201cEveryone seems to really like Canada Plus, and I appreciate how it\u2019s probably the most absurd thing on there,\u201d said the musician.\n\n\u201cWe got to a point a couple of years back where if you wanted this Canada-style deal to sound a bit more attractive, you just bunged another plus on the end.\n\n\u201cIt may be that each of those pluses stands for something very specific, but for those of us watching at home it just sounded like very weak marketing.\u201d\n\n(Rhodri Marsden)\n\nAnd while a lofty chart position is the aim of many artists, for Marsden the positive reaction he has received so far appears to be enough.\n\n\u201cI did it for a laugh with a dozen of my great pals and there you go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad that the fun we had doing it seems to have seeped out into the music.\n\n\u201cI was just delighted with the reaction \u2026 it was overwhelmingly positive, and in the sphere of Brexit that\u2019s quite unusual.\u201d", "description": "The record includes such tracks as Backstop, Canada Plus and Let\u00b4s Go WTO.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/wire-19544490-1570718927-967_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
