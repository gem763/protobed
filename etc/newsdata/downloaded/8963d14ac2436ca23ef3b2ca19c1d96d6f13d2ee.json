In a trailer for HBO\u2019s expensive-looking period drama Catherine the Great, Helen Mirren\u2019s 18th-century Russian empress molds her country into a future world power alongside lover and military commander (emphasis on the lover, based on this trailer) Grigory Potemkin, played by a scarred, mustachioed Jason Clarke. This is the kind of woman who would slap Mary Louise\u2019s cross necklace right off her chin. Catherine the Great premieres October 21.\n\nRelated", "description": "Helen Mirren stars in HBO\u2019s Catherine The Great trailer in the network\u2019s upcoming drama about the queen, airing fall 2020.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/06/06-catherine-the-great.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
