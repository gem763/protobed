I\u2019m told that police have stopped arresting rebels \u201cbecause they\u2019ve run out of space in the cells\u201d.'\n\nThe Met Police told MailOnline this morning that this is 'not accurate' but was unable to say how many of the 800 arrested were still detained. A spokesman for the force said: 'The Met has not reached cell capacity.'\n\nThe Government took the extraordinary step of drafting in 500 officers from 43 other police forces in England and Wales as they try to round up the mob bringing chaos to the capital.\n\nThose arrested include 91-year-old veteran campaigner John Lynes. Illegal sites in Whitehall and Horseferry Road remain closed while police spend hours dislodging the demonstrators without injuring them and sparking potential compensation claims.\n\nCircus performers joined the demonstrations last night, draping themselves in red robes to resemble blood. Invisible Circus - a street performance group from Bristol - joined their ranks today, adding their painted faces to the throngs descending on Downing Street\n\nWith faces painted white, they wore clothing designed to remind everyone present of the blood that binds humanity together as police admitted they were being forced to neglect crime victims to patrol the protests.\n\nThe Red Brigade (pictured) has hit the streets of London it the Extinction Rebellion protests. The Invisible Circus group from Bristol has its street performers dress in red drapes to symbolise the blood that binds humanity together and its members are pictured at Trafalgar Square in central London on Wednesday night\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch is the latest famous face to have shown up at the Extinction Rebellion protests that are clogging up central London\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch is pictured speaking with protesters demonstrating for Extinction Rebellion in central London\n\nThe protest group says its members intend to 'peacefully occupy and shut down' the airport's terminal building from 9am on Thursday.\n\nActivists say they will achieve this by lying, sitting or gluing themselves in front of the departure and arrival gates at the east London airport.\n\nIf they do not make it into the building, they plan to occupy the airport's access road and DLR station.\n\nThe latest protest is against the climate impact of flying and the Government's ongoing support of airport expansion.\n\nExtinction Rebellion spokesperson Rupert Read said: 'By non-violently shutting down this airport, in homage to the style of the Hong Kong democracy protesters, we are demonstrating the utter frailty of the transport systems that countries such as ours, unwisely, have come to depend upon.'\n\nThe group said hundreds of people have already signed up to take part in the protest, which will seem them 'non-violently use their bodies' to close the airport.\n\nIt said those taking part are willing to risk being arrested to achieve their aim.\n\nHundreds of police officers are being drafted in from across England and Wales to help the Metropolitan Police with the protests, which are now in their third day.\n\nActivists have been camped on rounds around Parliament Square and Whitehall since Monday calling for urgent action on climate change and wildlife.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed that 800 people had been arrested since Monday, with another 220 detained on Wednesday.\n\nMetropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Laurence Taylor said there are plans in place to intervene and 'deal proactively' with anyone who has the intention of shutting down the airport.\n\nA London City Airport spokesman said they were working with the Met Police to prepare for the protests and all passengers would be required to show their boarding pass to access the terminal.\n\nMet Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said yesterday that the scale of operation was having a big impact on policing in other areas of the capital.\n\nHe said: 'We haven't stopped policing, we never will, but it does mean that some activities beyond the normal responses are affected.\n\n'We cannot spent the amount of time with victims we would normally because we have to make sure we are dealing with the protests. We are not at the level we would want to be... and police officers should be working in their communities.'", "description": "Travellers face mayhem at the airport in east London, as demonstrators look set to emulate protesters who cancelled more than 1,000 flights as they railed against police brutality in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/02/19520032-0-image-a-23_1570670357138.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
