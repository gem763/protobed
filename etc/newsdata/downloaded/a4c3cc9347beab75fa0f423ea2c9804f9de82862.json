There was many groups that are not under control at all and they all have guns.\"\n\nThe hospital \u2014 the only one in the region that provides free health care to all parties \u2014 took in 51 patients in the span of 12 hours on Wednesday, including 10 who were dead on arrival.\n\nSome were fighters from the various factions, Seguin said, but the majority were civilians, including some children.\n\nWho's fighting who?\n\nThe outbreak of hostilities between the two sides is the latest twist in a complex and multi-faceted war in Yemen.\n\nThe central conflict in Yemen revolves around the Iran-aligned Houthis fighting the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.\n\nHaid's government forces are backed by a Western-armed, Sunni Muslim coalition, led by Saudi Arabia. That coalition includes the separatist STC, backed by the United Arab Emirates.\n\nBut the UAE has fallen out with Hadi and withdrawn many of its ground forces in Yemen, prompting the STC to try to gain control of Aden.\n\nThe separatists aim ultimately to restore the South Yemen republic which merged with the north in 1990. They had clashed occasionally with government forces for several years before major new hostilities erupted this month.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aden?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Aden</a>:51 wounded casualties have been admitted to the MSF hospital in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aden?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Aden</a> .10 were dead on arrival.

So they were separated from their families while they were managing these casualties,\" she said.\n\n\"Everybody worked like crazy without complaint, but when I spoke one by one with my colleagues, they were very worried for their families that were alone at home.\"\n\nSouthern separatist fighters are pictured during clashes with government forces in Aden on Thursday.
