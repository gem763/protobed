[Banks] are plainly having a very challenging time,'' he said.\n\nDr Morgan, who was a Treasury official when the economy was deregulated in the 1980s, also warned of the impacts of ultra-low interest rates, saying \"extreme quantitative easing\" \u2013 in the form of the direct financing of government deficits \u2013 was a taboo that could destroy the independence of the central bank.\n\nMore broadly, \u201cQE has contributed to asset price inflation, it has contributed to inequality, it has probably contributed to potentially excessive risk-taking\".\n\nA dangerous line to cross\n\nDr Morgan, who is now the chairman of Chi-X, said policymakers risked curtailing one of Australia's most renowned industries.\n\n\u201cBy world standards, we have a world class banking system. There are few big sectors where [Australia] can genuinely say we are in the first tier and fully globally competitive. Banking is one of them; it is a large sector, and we should make sure we don\u2019t overcorrect here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is only one thing worse than a profitable banking system \u2013 that\u2019s an unprofitable one,\" said Dr Morgan, who is working with banks in Germany, the Netherlands and Japan which are struggling under the weight of government and central bank policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe frank comments come after revelations Treasury is considering unusual monetary policies, such as buying bank bonds or mortgage securitisations to support bank lending to businesses.\n\nDr Morgan said while this form of quantitative easing was manageable and had offshore precedents, it would be a dangerous line to cross if the central bank considered financing government deficits.\n\n\"That\u2019s a very different proposition that really mingles monetary and fiscal policy and really calls into question the independence of central banks,\" he said.\n\nDr Morgan described such a measure as \"taboo\" and a policy adopted by the Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe and Argentina. \"It\u2019s a taboo most have avoided, and when that taboo is broken it is quite difficult to get that genie back into the bottle.\u201d\n\nGrowing power of regulators\n\nThe pressures on banks of ultra-low low rates will be on display on Thursday, when ANZ is expected to deliver flat cash earnings of around $6.5 billion for the full year, and potentially lower revenue growth.\n\nDr Morgan said official rates \"are not necessarily at the bottom, they could go to zero, and retail deposit margins will really get hit\u201d.\n\nA senior deputy secretary of Treasury during the Hawke-Keating government, where he worked on floating of the Australian dollar, financial deregulation and the dismantling of tariff protection, Dr Morgan also addressed the growing power of regulators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said it was important bank CEOs had a \u201ctrusted, non-legalistic relationship\u201d with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Frank conversations were crucial \u201cwithout having your legal counsel at your right arm\u201d.\n\nThe ACCC mortgage pricing inquiry reflected the banking industry's \"poor relationship with the current government\", which he said felt it had not been supported effectively after fighting against the royal commission on behalf of the banks before it was ultimately called.\n\nWith ASIC launching an appeal against a Federal Court decision that found Westpac had adhered to responsible lending laws, Dr Morgan described the laws, originally introduced by Labor, as \u201cwrong-headed legislation''.\n\n\"There is no misalignment between banks and customers. Banks have no possible interest in lending to you if you can\u2019t repay,'' he said.\n\nDespite the pressures on the banks, Australia was performing relatively well against its own history \u2013 including the \"economic vandalism of the Whitlam years and the do-nothingness of the Fraser years until the dying years of fiscal carnage\u201d \u2013 compared with other nations.\n\nThe US had unsustainable debt, and a president undermining the independence of the Federal Reserve, protectionism and an increase in inequity, while Europe \"is really faltering''.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, I have been in no country that would not happily swap their economic problems for Australia's,\" he said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let the best be the enemy of the good. We should have some balanced perspective on this.\u201d", "description": "Former Westpac boss David Morgan says the effect of regulatory scrutiny and low interest rates could cripple the banking sector.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4057%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_658%2C$y_103/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/42d072b75be15e05208718e42da051016343d456", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
