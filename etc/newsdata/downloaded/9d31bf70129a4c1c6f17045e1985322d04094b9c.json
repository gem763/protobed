If real data show that most people will be fine in retirement, that\u2019s great news. I\u2019ll spend more time in Tuscany.\n\nBut from everything I know, the financial aspect of retirement will be a challenge for a lot of households. So I\u2019m really interested in data that show the contrary. Biggs breaks his argument into two parts: 1) retirees are doing increasingly well, and 2) retirees recognize that things are improving. Because the subjective data were more readily accessible, I started there.\n\nUsing data from the Health and Retirement Study, Biggs reports that \u201c93% of seniors described their retirement as \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018moderately\u2019 satisfying in 2016 versus only 77% in 1992.\u201d\n\nI (or at least my colleague Anqi Chen) can duplicate those numbers, and they are shown in the figure below. Indeed, adding together \u201cvery satisfied\u201d and \u201cmoderately satisfied\u201d produces 77% in 1992 and 93% in 2016. But those 1992 numbers look weird. It turns out that the sample consisted of only 300 households, and some categories had less than 25 households. So 1992 should not be the starting point for any comparison.\n\nIn fact the sample size remained small until 1998, so it makes more sense to start there. If I were in a snarky mode, I might be tempted to say between 1998 and 2016, the percentage \u201cnot at all satisfied\u201d increased from 6.0% to 7.2%, and the percentage \u201cvery satisfied\u201d declined from 62.6% to 53.4% (see figure below). That would suggest that things were getting worse.\n\nBut my main point is that, once the sample size got large enough, the numbers have held steady. They do not show any upward trend in satisfaction. Moreover, the question relates to all aspects of retirement, not just finances. I posed this interpretation of the data to Biggs.\n\n\u201cThe HRS [Health and Retirement Study] correction rebuts about half of maybe 15 points I made in the article (only half, because the number of dissatisfied retirees is low throughout),\u201d he said. \u201cMy point is that there\u2019s no crisis today, and models like MINT don\u2019t project a crisis in the future.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to look at all the data, but so far I\u2019m not persuaded.", "description": "The data don\u2019t really speak for themselves.", "authors": ["Alicia H.
