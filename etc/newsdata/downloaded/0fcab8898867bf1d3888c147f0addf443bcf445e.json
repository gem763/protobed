GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares up as Brexit, Hong Kong progress lifts mood\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\n* Brexit vote boosts global shares\n\n* HK tension eases for now, but concerns remain\n\n* Oil pulls back in Asia after strong rally overnight\n\nBy Stanley White\n\nTOKYO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Asian stocks perked up on\n\nThursday, as apparent progress in the political crises in\n\nBritain and Hong Kong gave investor confidence a shot in the\n\narm, with easing fears of a hard Brexit lifting the battered\n\npound.\n\nSterling held onto gains against the dollar in Asia after\n\nrallying by its most in more than five months on Wednesday as\n\nlawmakers voted to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson taking\n\nBritain out of the European Union without a deal on Oct.\n\n31. Risk appetite also rose on news that Hong Kong leader Carrie\n\nLam was withdrawing an extradition bill that had triggered\n\nmonths of often violent protests in the Asian financial\n\nhub. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nwas up 0.24%. U.S. Treasury yields extended\n\ngains in Asia and the yield curve steepened, both signs that\n\ninvestors were willing to take on riskier assets.\n\nStill, there was scepticism over how long the positive mood\n\nwould last with Britain's divorce from the EU and political\n\nunrest in Hong Kong not yet completely resolved.\n\n\"In a world of negative news, a bunch of things came\n\ntogether and we had something positive,\" said Shane Oliver, head\n\nof investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital\n\nInvestors in Sydney.\n\n\"We should see some follow through in Asia. There is reduced\n\nrisk of a no-deal Brexit, but Brexit is still all over the\n\nplace. Some protesters in Hong Kong say they're still not\n\nsatisfied.\"\n\nShares rallied on Wednesday in New York, with the S&P 500\n\ngaining 1.08%.\n\nU.S. stock futures fell 0.03% in early Asian trade,\n\nbut a 1.09% increase in Japan's Nikkei and 0.33%\n\nincrease in Australian shares highlighted the\n\nimprovement in market sentiment.\n\nThe 10-year yield rose to 1.4758%, while\n\ntwo-year yields rose to 1.4519%.\n\nThe spread between two- and 10-year Treasury yields\n\nUS2US10=TWEB , the most commonly used measure of the yield\n\ncurve, rose to its highest since Aug. 21 on Wednesday but\n\nnarrowed slightly in Asian trade.\n\nThe curve inverted on Aug. 14 for the first time since 2007\n\nwhen long-term yields traded below short-term yields, which is a\n\nwidely accepted indicator of coming recession.\n\nMore than three years since the United Kingdom voted 52-48%\n\nto leave the EU, it is still unclear on what terms, or indeed\n\nwhether, Brexit will take place on the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nThe global economy is already struggling with the threat of\n\nrecession due to a bruising trade war between the United States\n\nand China.\n\nBlocking the path to a no-deal Brexit relieves concern about\n\nanother potential drag on global growth, but Britain is still\n\nheaded for a snap election, which could introduce more political\n\nuncertainty about who will lead Britain out of the EU.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday withdrew an\n\nextradition bill that had triggered months of often violent\n\nprotests in the Chinese-ruled city, sparking a late rally in\n\nHong Kong stocks. Traders will watch closely to see whether shares in Hong\n\nKong are able to extend those gains or whether they fall\n\non concerns about relations with Beijing.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 0.34% to\n\n$56.07 per barrel in Asia on Thursday. Crude futures surged 4.3%\n\non Wednesday, the biggest daily gain since July 10, due to\n\npositive economic data from China and easing geopolitical\n\nconcerns.\n\n(Editing by Sam Holmes)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares up as Brexit, Hong Kong progress lifts mood", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0E0NI_L.jpg"}
