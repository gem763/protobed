(Photo: ROB CARR, AP)\n\nPaul Barrere, guitarist and singer for the long-running rock group Little Feat, has died at 71, the band announced.\n\nIn a blog post shared Saturday and signed by Little Feat members Bill Payne, Sam Clayton, Fred Tackett, Kenny Gradney and Gabe Ford on the band's official website, they announced the death of \"our brother guitarist, Paul Barrere\" on Saturday morning at the UCLA Hospital amid \"ongoing treatment for liver disease.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to a Little Feat representative for comment.\n\nLittle Feat originally formed in 1969. Barrere auditioned at the time as a bassist but eventually joined the band three years later as a guitarist. \"As a bassist, I make an excellent guitarist,\" group members recalled him saying. He stuck with the band since joining in 1972 but sat on the sideline for Little Feat's current tour, which is scheduled to end Sunday in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, for medical treatment.\n\nBarrere performs during the 2019 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.

It says Barrere advised fans, \u201c \"Keep your sailin\u2019 shoes close by \u2026 if I have my way, you\u2019re going to need them!' \u201d\n\nBarrere also recorded and performed with Bonnie Raitt, Carly Simon and Robert Palmer, according to his official bio.\n\nRaitt mourned the musician's death early Sunday on Twitter, calling Barrere a \"brilliant guitarist, singer and songwriter\" and a \"cornerstone of one of the greatest bands of all time.\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm glad he is free of pain and may he rest in peace. I send my deep love and condolences to his family, bandmates and friends. We will hold him in our hearts and celebrate his life and music always.\"\n\n(2/2) I'm glad he is free of pain and may he rest in peace.
