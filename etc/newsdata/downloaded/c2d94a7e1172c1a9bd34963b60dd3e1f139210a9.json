Ramos Miranda\n\nDemonstrators gather during a protest against Chile's state economic model in Santiago, Chile October 25, 2019. REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - As many as a million Chileans protested on Friday in the capital Santiago in the biggest demonstrations yet since violence broke out a week ago over entrenched inequality in the South American nation.\n\nDemonstrators waving national flags, blowing whistles and horns, wafting incense and bearing placards urging political and social change streamed through the streets, walking for miles from around Santiago to converge on Plaza Italia.\n\nThe scenes were replicated in cities around the country. Traffic already hobbled by truck and taxi drivers adding their own protest over road tolls ground to a standstill in Santiago as roads were closed and public transport shut down early ahead of marches that built throughout the afternoon.\n\nSantiago governor Karla Rubilar said almost a million people marched in the capital - more than five percent of the country\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cToday is a historic day,\u201d Rubilar wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Metropolitan Region is host to a peaceful march of almost one million people who represent a dream for a new Chile.\u201d\n\nClotilde Soto, a retired teacher aged 82, said she was marching because she did not want to die without seeing change.\n\n\u201cAbove all we need better salaries and better pensions, she said.\n\nProtests that started over a hike in public transport fares boiled into riots, arson and looting that have killed at least 17 people, injured hundreds, brought more than 7,000 arrests and caused more than $1.4 billion of losses to Chilean businesses.\n\nChile\u2019s military has taken over security in Santiago, a city of 6 million people now under a state of emergency with night-time curfews.\n\nOn Friday morning, trucks, cars and taxis had slowed to a crawl on major roads, honking horns and waving Chilean flags. \u201cNo more tolls! Enough with the abuse!\u201d read bright yellow-and-red signs plastered to the front of vehicles.\n\nChile\u2019s unrest is the latest in a flare-up of protests in South America and round the world - from Beirut to Barcelona - each with local triggers but also sharing underlying anger at social disparities and ruling elites.\n\nChile\u2019s two-term President Sebastian Pinera trounced the opposition in the most recent 2017 election, dealing the center-left ruling coalition its biggest loss since the end of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship in 1990.\n\nBut now many protest placards and graffiti scrawled on buildings around the city call for his exit.\n\nRelated Coverage Chile protesters block access to lithium operations: local leader\n\nMULTICOLORED CROWD\n\nAs crowds of colorful demonstrators stretched along Santiago\u2019s thoroughfares as far as the eye could see, the noise of pots and pans being clanged with spoons, a clamor that has become the soundtrack for the popular uprising, was ear-splitting.\n\n\u201cThe people, united, will never be defeated,\u201d the crowds chanted over the din.\n\nBy early evening there had been no signs of violence or clashes with the security forces, who maintained a significant but low-key presence inside paint-spattered and stone-dented armored vehicles parked in side streets.\n\nBeatriz Demur, 42, a yoga teacher from the suburb of Barrio Brazil, joined a stream of demonstrators shuffling toward Plaza Italia with her daughter Tabatha, 22.\n\n\u201cWe want Chile to be a better place,\u201d said Demur. \u201cThe most powerful have privatized everything. It\u2019s been that way for 30 years.\u201dEyeing the crowds packing the square, her daughter said: \u201cI have waited for this a long time ... It\u2019s not scary, it\u2019s exciting. It means change.\u201d\n\nAnali Parra, 26, a street hawker, was with her daughter Catalina, 9, and five-month-old son Gideon Jesus, his buggy decked in streamers and a flag of the indigenous Mapuche flag.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to go away,\u201d Parra said. \u201cPinera should just go now.\u201d\n\n\u2018URGENT\u2019 REFORMS\n\nMany bus drivers in Santiago also staged a walk-off on Friday after one of their number was shot.\n\nWhile much of wealthy east Santiago has remained calm under evening lockdown, the poorer side of the city has seen widespread vandalism and looting.\n\nPinera, a billionaire businessman, told the nation on Thursday he had heard the demands of Chileans \u201cloud and clear.\u201d\n\nHe has sent lawmakers legislation to overturn a recent hike in electricity rates, and called for reforms to guarantee a minimum wage of $480 a month and introduce state medical insurance for catastrophes.\n\nSeated with a group of elderly Chileans over lunch on Friday, Pinera put finishing touches on a bill to hike minimum pensions by 20%. \u201cWe must approve these projects with the urgency that Chileans demand,\u201d Pinera said.\n\nSlideshow (35 Images)\n\nAn online poll conducted by local company Activa Research of 2,090 people between Oct. 22-23 found 83% of respondents said they supported the goals of the demonstrators, but 72.5% opposed violence as a method of protest.\n\nThe principal causes of the protests were low salaries, high utility prices, poor pensions and economic inequality, it said.", "description": "As many as a million Chileans protested on Friday in the capital Santiago in the biggest demonstrations yet since violence broke out a week ago over entrenched inequality in the South American nation.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445040640&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P01D", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
