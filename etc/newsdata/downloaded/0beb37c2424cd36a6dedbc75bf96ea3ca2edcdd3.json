Maybe he missed it but the Left has spent the last three years pretending Putin voted for Trump and magically made him our president.\n\nTake a look:\n\nIt also obvious that with this Biden attack, @realDonaldTrump is trying to launch and give life to another conspiracy theory, like Birtherism, Uranium One and other phony memes that jave always been a go-to in his political toolbox and reliable red meat for right-wing media. \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) September 21, 2019\n\nRed-meat for the right-wing media.\n\nRIGHT DAVE. It\u2019s SO obvious.\n\nNick Searcy unloaded on him:\n\nBiden bragged about it, @davidaxelrod. You corrupt losers are utterly shameless. https://t.co/kLpVVZBjtq \u2014 Nick Searcy, INTERNATIONAL FILM & TELEVISION STAR (@yesnicksearcy) September 21, 2019\n\nThere is a video of Biden bragging about it but yeah, the right totally made this whole thing up.\n\nThere is video of Joe Biden admitting what you are calling a conspiracy. \u2014 Ginny (@ginkates) September 21, 2019\n\nSee, we didn\u2019t even make that up.\n\nTold him.\n\nBiden BRAGGED about it and the timeframe is a textbook quid pro quo. \u2014 Jim (@Ifitsthisname) September 21, 2019\n\nBiden bragged about bullying the company that fired his son from his no-show job. Just how is #UraniumOne a conspiracy theory? It is fact. \u2014 Gary HokieHawk (@grsvt81) September 21, 2019\n\nThis Biden thing is not birtherism. That's actually rather repugnant to suggest. This whole Hunter / Dad thing smells. Is it worse than a stink, I don't know, but there is substance to this. \u2014 Dog guy (@Catsorange1) September 21, 2019\n\nHe openly admitted to committing a felony, on the record. If that's what you consider a conspiracy theory, then you're a partisan hack. So\u2026 Since you're so hip to blame the right for this, who on the right forced Joe Biden to extort the Ukraine? I'll wait. \u2014 Conservative Welder \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@jvonmuenster) September 21, 2019\n\nYou mean like the phony Russia conspiracy theory? \u2014 Seriously Dog (@SrslyDog) September 21, 2019\n\nHello pot, have you met our friend kettle?\n\nHey Fredo (@ChrisCuomo) @RudyGiuliani is right.
