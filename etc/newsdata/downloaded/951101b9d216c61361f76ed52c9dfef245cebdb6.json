We will oppose them and we will use our votes to defeat them. Let me say clearly from this platform today that we want to support a deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom and which does not leave Northern Ireland behind.\n\n\u201cBut without change, we will not vote for the prime minister\u2019s agreement. It would be bad for Northern Ireland economically and will weaken the foundations of this great United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nEarlier the party\u2019s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, referenced Boris Johnson\u2019s speech at the same event last year when he pledged not to erect economic barriers in the Irish sea.\n\nJohnson had said: \u201cIf we wanted to vary our regulation, then we would have to leave Northern Ireland behind as an economic semi-colony of the EU. We would be damaging the fabric of the union.\u201d\n\nDodds told delegates: \u201cStick to your word, prime minister.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis party has always made clear that we want a deal. A deal that works for the whole of the United Kingdom and for the European Union. A deal that recognises Northern Ireland\u2019s unique history and geography.\n\n\u201cA deal that supports our business community and families across this province. But, this party will only support a deal that ensures Northern Ireland leaves the European Union in a way that protects both the economic and constitutional integrity of our United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe current deal provided the \u201cworst of both worlds\u201d, he concluded, saying that although the party wanted to deliver Brexit it would not do so at \u201cany price\u201d.\n\nJohnson and his negotiating team agreed a new deal with the EU last week, which included special arrangements for the region, allowing the UK to leave the customs union while Northern Ireland continues to follow some of the bloc\u2019s customs laws.\n\nIf sitting, the devolved Northern Ireland assembly would be able to vote in 2024 on whether to keep following the rules.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe conference speeches come after Jonathan Powell, the government\u2019s chief negotiator during the talks that led to the Good Friday agreement, accused Johnson of \u201cplaying games\u201d with the peace process this week.", "description": "Arlene Foster highlights importance of party\u2019s 10 parliamentary votes in propping up government", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c9d29a19114bcf81e8ecc7a342d2e946a5dad18/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0bc5ee4147a908dc11ef5e9f57d95752", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
