PPP is facilitating JUI-F for its \u2018Azadi March\u2019 in Sindh and JUI-F is getting all possible help from the Sindh government for its march but is campaigning against the PPP in the by-election,\u201d said Khuhro.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "", "authors": ["Web Desk", "Shakoor Nizamani"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/nayyar-bukhari.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
