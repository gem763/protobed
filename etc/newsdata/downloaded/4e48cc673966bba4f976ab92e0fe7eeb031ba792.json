The rest has already been lost \u2014 everything from 1920 until now,\u201d Fischer, of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Mountain Research in Innsbruck, said of her work seeking Austria\u2019s oldest ice at the top of the Weisseespitze, a peak more than 11,000 feet high.\n\n\u201cIn the next two years we will lose another 70 years (of ice and data),\u201d she added, describing ice at the top of the glacier.\n\nThe cabin of a cable car makes its way uphill to the Sonnblick Observatory at 3,106 meters above sea level, in the Hohe Tauern mountain range near Rauris, Austria.

Her samples are going through lab testing to date them.\n\nThe lower layers are more densely packed than those at the top, meaning that one meter of ice could include thousands of years of data.\n\n\u201cThe ice is only a few meters thick. In a few years, this summit will be completely ice-free,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Pasterze Glacier, Austria's largest, is seen below Johannisberg summit located in the Hohe Tauern mountain range, in the province of Carinthia.

That is what we are determining with this drilling of the ice.\u201d (Reuters)\n\nPhotography by Lisi Niesner/Reuters\n\nPhotos taken November 2018 and July 2019\n\nSee more news-related photo galleries and follow us on Yahoo News Photo Twitter and Tumblr.\n\nMeteorologist Elke Ludewig from the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics ZAMG, looks up an ice load scale at the Sonnblick Observatory.
