(Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nIf, like me, you claim unofficial membership in the League of Enthusiastic Americans with Slightly Overactive Imaginations, the past few weeks have brought both exciting and weird news. Here\u2019s the exciting: The United States Navy has basically admitted that UFOs are real. Here\u2019s the weird: Very few people seem to care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps you\u2019ve seen the video evidence, which has floated around the Internet since 2017, after being leaked to the New York Times and \u2014 wait for it, because this is awesome \u2014 the To the Stars Academy of Arts & Sciences, a UFO-curious organization founded by a former member of the pop-punk band Blink-182. In the footage, recorded by Navy pilots, you can see mysterious unidentified aircraft, some surrounded by an enveloping glow, prompting various incredulous comments, such as \u201cLook at that thing, dude!\u201d and \u201cWow, what is that, man?\u201d\n\nThese objects \u2014 the Navy prefers we call them \u201cunexplained aerial phenomena\u201d instead of \u201cUFOs,\u201d but come on, whom are they kidding? \u2014 \u201cundertook aerial maneuvers that aren\u2019t possible with current aviation technology,\u201d Popular Mechanics reports. \u201cIn the 2004 incident, according to the New York Times, the objects \u2018appeared suddenly at 80,000 feet, and then hurtled toward the sea, eventually stopping at 20,000 feet and hovering. Then they either dropped out of radar range or shot straight back up.\u2019\u201d\n\nCommander David Fravor, who piloted an F/A-18F Super Hornet that day over airspace near San Diego, told the Times of an object that hovered over the ocean, \u201caround 40 feet long and oval in shape,\u201d jolting around above a churning marine \u201cdisturbance\u201d that \u201clooked like frothy waves and foam, as if the water were boiling.\u201d As he headed for the object, it fled, accelerating \u201clike nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d In the end, this whole bizarre ball of aeronautical wax left Commander Fravor, as he told the Times, \u201cpretty weirded out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo kidding. Me too! But don\u2019t worry: The Navy would also like you to know, as Popular Mechanics helpfully adds, that the video clips \u201cshould have never been released to the public in the first place.\u201d Ah. Here\u2019s my no-bologna translation for that, folks: Remember the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, where some anonymous elderly government worker in a newsboy cap slowly wheels the Ark of the Covenant into a giant warehouse undoubtedly full of other mystical and legendary treasures, never to meet the public eye? There\u2019s almost definitely something like that for videos of UFOs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, to be fair, because these unidentified flying objects are, well, unidentified, we can\u2019t declare them the work of a band of extraterrestrial alien explorers just yet. Nor can we jump the gun and storm Area 51, as approximately 3,000 fun-loving Americans pretended to attempt to do \u2014 most of them were pretending, at least, I think \u2014 on Friday, September 20.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe potential explanations are countless, really: Perhaps the UFOs are part of a secret Russian spy operation. (In 2019, it\u2019s always the Russians, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s like the 1980 and 1984 Olympics combined.) Perhaps the UFOs are part of a top-secret United States Air Force project so top-secret that the United States Navy knows nothing about it. Perhaps there\u2019s even some smart-aleck high-I.Q. kid in La Jolla laughing his rear end off right now because he just fooled us all with his army of souped-up garage-built drones.\n\nBut regardless, isn\u2019t it rather mind-boggling that this story \u2014 a true-life tale that touches on pretty much every high-drama topic in the world, including spycraft, metaphysics, theology, military intrigue, and the question of whether we are alone in the universe \u2014 has not become a massive multiweek front-page affair, garnished with deep-dive follow-ups and an engaged cadre of Earthlings clamoring for the truth?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, despite my aforementioned slightly overactive imagination \u2014 a predisposition that leads me to devour news stories about things like haunted houses and the North American Sasquatch and possessed dolls named Annabelle and, well, UFOs \u2014 I completely missed this story\u2019s first go-round two years ago. Somehow, the Great UFO Video Leakage of 2017 managed to waft away in a small cloud of news-cycle pixie dust, lost amid Russiagate (there they are again!) and Twitter kerfuffles and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and that fascinating category of people who consistently lose their minds over the very existence of the rather mild-mannered Mike Pence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, UFOs, schmoo-eff-ohs. Nobody cared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no delusions: I suppose the story\u2019s second go-round, with U.S. Navy confirmation and all, will meet a similar destiny. After all, we have other things to worry about, or at least so I am told. For starters, there\u2019s the suggestion that \u201cwe are in the beginning of a mass extinction\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly on September 23. On the same day, to halt this impending catastrophe, climate activists clogged up the streets of D.C., armed with a bunch of high-carbon-footprint props. Next, they threw a bunch of confetti on the ground, lit a dumpster on fire, and had one very enthusiastic young man in alarmingly short jean shorts twerking in front of a banner that said \u201cCapitalism is killing the planet.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not your cup of tea, I understand. You can always worry about the herd of Democrats currently running for president, who seem on the verge of losing their collective mind. There they are, loud and clear, hollering about things like socialism and national rent control and seizing guns and taxing meat and supporting abortion until birth and stealing everyone\u2019s money \u2014 or, if you\u2019re Joe Biden, offering a variation on these themes while regularly veering off into random rants about things like the sexual identities of prisoners and how Americans should \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmm. Who knows? Maybe we\u2019ll never see the UFOs again. Perhaps we managed to scare them all away.", "description": "The United States Navy has basically admitted that UFOs are real.
