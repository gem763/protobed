Christians were scattered from the metropolis and the nearby Nineveh Plain, as ISIS imposed Sharia law. Even after Mosul was liberated, Christians wondered if they could return. Would the city ever be safe again? Could they trust their neighbors, who in many cases took over the properties they had to leave?\n\nISIS fighters have been said to be lying low and ready to regroup if the opportunity presents itself. The United States\u2019 recent pullback from neighboring Syria, withdrawing support from their Kurdish allies, who were guarding prisons full of the Islamist fighters, was not encouraging news for still-vulnerable Christian communities.\n\nBut the United Arab Emirates and UNESCO, the United Nations\u2019 cultural organization, seem to be casting a vote of confidence for Iraq\u2019s Christians. A partnership announced October 10 will help rebuild two Catholic churches in Mosul that were destroyed in the ISIS rampage of 2014.\n\nThe partnership is part of the UAE\u2019s \u201cYear of Tolerance\u201d initiative, which began with a $50.4 million agreement signed in April 2018 to help rebuild historical landmarks in Mosul, according to Catholic News Agency. The October 10 announcement is an addition to UNESCO\u2019s Revive the Spirit of Mosul Initiative, which UNESCO called an \u201cimportant step for the Christians of the East who are part of Mosul history and future.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s signing is a pioneering partnership that sends a message of light, in seemingly darker times,\u201d Noura Al Kaabi, UAE Minister for Culture and Knowledge Development, said at UNESCO headquarters in Paris. She was accompanied by UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay; the Ambassador of Iraq to France, Abdulrahman Hamid al-Husseini; and Dominican Brothers Nicolas Tixier and Olivier Poquillon.\n\nAl-Saa\u2019a is a Dominican church that was built between 1866 and 1873, and is often referred to as \u201cClock Church,\u201d due to the clock lodged in its tower, a gift from Empress Eugenie of France to the Dominican Fathers of Mosul. Once rehabilitated, its convent will serve both as place of worship and as a community center for all of Mosul\u2019s residents, UNESCO said.\n\nAl-Tahera is a Syriac Catholic church built in 1862.\n\nIn January 2019 I visited this Church with the College of Archaeology / Mosul University. pic.twitter.com/22WCgEbrqA \u2014 \u0645\u0647\u064a\u0627\u0631 (@Mehiyar) August 16, 2019\n\nUniversity of Mosul students\u2014from the departments of archaeology, architecture and engineering\u2014are expected to take part in the process of restoration of landmark buildings, according to UNESCO.\n\n\u201cBy rebuilding a fraction of the past, Iraq can shape its future as an inclusive, tolerant and open society which has always found a tangible manifestation in Mosul\u2019s rich historical sites,\u201d Al Kaabi said.\n\nDuring the signing ceremony, the international partners described the rehabilitation of the churches as \u201cimportant not only because of their value as cultural heritage, but also as testimonies to the diversity that has been the historic hallmark of the city, a proud crossroads of cultures and a peaceful haven for different religious communities over the centuries,\u201d according to a UNESCO press release.\n\nBrothers Tixier and Poquillon thanked UNESCO in the name of the order and reiterated their attachment to Mosul, where Dominicans have built bridges among all communities since the 18th century.\n\nCNA noted that the Islamic State destroyed at least 28 sites of religious significance in the city after taking control of it in June 2014, including the Tomb of Jonah, Iraq\u2019s oldest monastery of the Assyrian Church of the East.\n\nInter-religious teams have already been cooperating to rebuild parts of the city, the news agency reported. In April, Syriac Catholic Archbishop Youhanna Boutros Moshe of Mosul told Aid to the Church in Need that \u201cthere are very clear and concrete signs of progress\u201d in the Mosul area.\n\n\u201cCredit belongs to the faith-based and humanitarian organizations that rushed in to support us,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we still lack the funds to complete the reconstruction of all the homes that were very badly damaged or completely destroyed; we are waiting and hoping that governments, like those of the United Kingdom and Hungary, will step in and help us on this front.\u201d", "description": "Move seen as solidifying diverse nature of Iraq's second city, after ISIS tried to run it according to strict Islamic law", "authors": ["John Burger"], "top_image": "https://aleteiaen.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/screen-shot-2019-10-23-at-11.56.38-am-e1571846373908.png?w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
