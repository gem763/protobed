Under New Employment Bill, Restaurants Now Have To Give Tips To All Workers\n\nAs part of a new bill announced today by the Queen, all the workers in restaurants, pubs and hotels will receive 100% of their tips. \"My government will take steps to make work fairer, introducing measures that will support those working hard,\" she said.\n\nCurrently, companies are following a system that has no legal obligation to pass service charge to the staff. The new bill will now let the employees take advantage of the tips given to them and this will apply to companies in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nTIME\n\nThe new Employment Bill will ensure that the cash (tip) is given to the staff; that means restaurateurs will have to 'pass on all tips, gratuities and service charges to workers without deductions'.\n\nA lot of the time, servers and waiters miss out on tips simply because there are no rules with regard to this. Tips are not meant for restaurants, they are meant for individual workers.\n\nDon't Miss 130 SHARES 374 SHARES 1.8 K SHARES\n\nFinally, now the system will be transparent.\n\nWe all wish we get full appreciation, wherever we work!
