When these bacteria reach large numbers, infection is more likely.\n\n\u201cI recommend paying careful attention to the symbol on the bottle (usually says 3M or 6M with an egg timer or open jar symbol) and discarding the bottle after the manufacturer\u2019s recommended period.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cNot all eye infections are immediately obvious, so don\u2019t be tempted to lend someone your mascara wand just because they don\u2019t have a sticky, red eye.\n\n\u201cDemodex mites live in many people\u2019s eyelash follicles and can be transferred by sharing mascara.\n\n\u201cThese cause gradual inflammation and irritation of the lid margin (blepharitis) and are tough to get rid of.\n\n\u201cSerious infections of the cornea are rare but are more likely if you accidentally scratch your eye with the mascara wand. So, make sure you\u2019re somewhere steady and don\u2019t be tempted to apply your mascara on a moving train or in the car.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that oil-based eye make-up removers can also disrupt your tear film and are normally needed when the mascara is water-proof.\u201d\n\nIt comes after one woman was almost left blind after 25 years of falling asleep with her eye make-up on \u2013 causing solid black lumps to become embedded in her eye.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nTheresa Lynch, 51, saw a doctor suffering with heavy, painful eyelids and her eyes were irritated and weepy.\n\nThis story originally appeared on The Sun.
