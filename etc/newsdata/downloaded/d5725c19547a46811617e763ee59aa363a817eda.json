In three key battleground races, a Democratic challenger brought in more than the senator against whom they\u2019re running: Mark Kelly beating out Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), Theresa Greenfield outraising Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Sara Gideon outraising Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). And in one of the top GOP targets, John James outraised Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.).\n\nThey weren\u2019t the only challengers who outraised sitting senators \u2014 independent Al Gross brought in more than Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Democrat Amy McGrath swamped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky \u2014 but the four battleground races are particularly important, as early signs point toward both parties having the resources to compete. However, incumbents broadly have one crucial advantage: With the exception of McSally, they all have more money in the bank. Pros can read more on the exact numbers in our fundraising roundup.\n\nThe Senate fundraising reports also help clear up how some primaries will break down. On the Democratic side, Theresa Greenfield, Sara Gideon, North Carolina\u2019s Cal Cunningham and Colorado\u2019s John Hickenlooper all put a lot of distance between themselves and other primary hopefuls in the money race. That\u2019s not the case for the Texas Democratic primary, though. While MJ Hegar raised the most, it probably isn\u2019t enough to chase other competitors like Royce West, Amanda Edwards, Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez or Chris Bell.\n\nTwo battleground Republican primaries where we didn\u2019t get complete clarity: Alabama and New Hampshire. There\u2019s no clear frontrunner in the Alabama primary between Rep. Bradley Byrne, Tommy Tuberville, John Merrill and Arnold Mooney \u2014 Byrne has a significant cash on hand advantage, but he\u2019s facing one self-funder and another who took out a loan to fund his campaign (and don\u2019t forget about Roy Moore, who barely raised anything but is still in the water). And none of the Republicans in New Hampshire \u2014 Corky Messner, Don Bolduc or Bill O\u2019Brien \u2014 posted particularly inspiring quarters, as Corey Lewandowski still teases a potential bid.\n\nPresidential Big Board\n\nTHE CASH DASH \u2014 Biden spent more than $2 million more than he raised and has a cash on hand total well below other top tier candidates, leading some Democrats to wonder about the long-term viability of his campaign. \u201cIf he stumbles at all, he\u2019s in big trouble. Is it enough to make it through Iowa and New Hampshire? Probably. But if he comes in third in Iowa, I don\u2019t see how he recovers,\u201d Democratic strategist Joe Trippi told POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo and Natasha Korecki. \u201cBiden and his campaign have insisted for months that he\u2019s got a plan and he\u2019s sticking to it. \u2018I am confident,\u2019 Biden told reporters on Wednesday after his financial reports revealed his precarious condition. He also said he isn\u2019t changing anything, and then took a veiled shot at Warren for transferring money from her Senate account before entering the presidential race.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Candidates are broaching a subject in fundraising that they dared not touch before: impeachment. \u201cTrump and the Democratic presidential candidates are joined by a legion of congressional candidates and party committees who have similarly sought to make money off the specter of impeachment, peppering prospective donors with endless asks for money,\u201d The Center for Public Integrity\u2019s Dave Levinthal and Chris Zubak-Skees wrote. \u201cI would not have felt comfortable doing that \u2014 fundraising on impeachment,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.), who chaired the NRCC right after House Republicans lost seats following the Clinton impeachment. \u201cImpeachment \u2014 it\u2019s very sobering. It\u2019s not a pleasant task.\u201d\n\nTHE PROCESS \u2014 Colorado is asking the Supreme Court to weigh in on if states can legally bind their Electoral College electors\u2019 votes. \u201cThe case stems from the 2016 election, when three Democratic Party electors \u2026 were told by then-Secretary of State Wayne Williams that state law required them to vote for Hillary Clinton because she won Colorado\u2019s popular vote,\u201d The Denver Post\u2019s Anna Staver reported. Ultimately, the three electors sued and the 10th circuit ruled that the state\u2019s removal of one of the electors \u201cand nullification of his vote were unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nSTAFFING UP \u2014 The Trump reelection bid continues to grow: Stephanie Alexander, Jason Simmons and Elissa-Ann Voccola were all hired as regional political directors for Trump Victory. Campaign Pro\u2019s Daniel Strauss has more in his regularly-scheduled staff tracker for Pros.\n\nENDORSEMENT CORNER \u2014 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-N.Y.) soon-to-be endorsement of Bernie Sanders could provide a jolt to his campaign. POLITICO\u2019s Alex Thompson and Holly Otterbein have the details of how it came together: \u201cAs the 78-year-old Sanders laid in a hospital bed in Nevada after a heart attack, with his presidential campaign in jeopardy, his campaign manager Faiz Shakir received a call and passed his phone to the Vermont senator. It was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She told Sanders she was coming aboard his campaign, months before she was expected to issue an endorsement.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said that she hasn\u2019t made an endorsement yet after CNN reported she was expected to back Sanders, but noted Sanders will visit her district later this month, per The Detroit News\u2019 Beth LeBlanc.\n\nDown the Ballot\n\nTHE CASH DASH \u2014 ActBlue, the Democratic online fundraising platform, continues to be a difference maker for Democrats. More than $297 million flowed through the platform during the third quarter, the company announced. The platform is still growing, as well: One million new unique donors used the platform in the quarter. Mobile phones are also increasingly important: 58 percent of donations were made via mobile device, the highest percentage of donations made via mobile in a single quarter, ever. In addition, some more odds-and-ends from the filing deadline:\n\n\u2014 Primary challengers to several prominent New York City Democrats raised significant amounts of cash in the third quarter, POLITICO New York\u2019s Erin Durkin reported.\n\n\u2014 Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) raised $573,000 for his Senate run and has $1.9 million on hand (filing).\n\n\u2014 GOP Rep. David Schweikert in AZ-06 raised $136,000 and had $144,000 in cash on hand (filing).\n\nTHE HOUSE MAP \u2014 Chelsea Clinton won\u2019t run in NY-17 for retiring Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey\u2019s seat. \u201cI\u2019m not considering running,\u201d she said on \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cI understand why people are asking \u2026 [but] I think it is a question that shouldn\u2019t just be asked of people whose last name is Clinton on Huntsman.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Democrat Ralph Kaehler, a farmer and businessman, said he\u2019d run against freshman GOP Rep. Jim Hagedorn in MN-01, per the Post Bulletin\u2019s Matthew Stolle. Democrat Dan Feehan, who narrowly lost to Hagedorn in 2018, is also running.\n\n\u2014 Democrat Cort VanOstran, who narrowly lost to GOP Rep. Ann Wagner in MO-02, will not run again, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\u2019s Kurt Erickson reported.\n\n\u2014 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy endorsed Republican Lisa Scheller\u2019s bid to challenge freshman Democratic Rep. Susan Wild in PA-07.\n\nTHE SENATE MAP \u2014 Barbara Bollier, a Democratic state senator and a doctor, announced she\u2019d run for the Senate in Kansas. Bollier was a former Republican state senator who switched parties last year, saying \u201cas the party turned its back on Kansas values, I turned away from that party,\u201d in her launch video.\n\n\u2014 A spokesperson for Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said she will make a decision on a Senate run after the end of the year, per KPVI\u2019s Nick Reynolds.\n\nAD WARS \u2014 Republican Woody Thrasher, who is primarying West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, released a new ad taking a shot at Justice, saying \u201cwe want our children to stay in West Virginia,\u201d while hitting on a classic grievance: paving the roads.\n\n\u2014 Louisiana Republican Eddie Rispone released a pair of ads featuring Trump\u2019s rally in the state last week. The first ad says Louisiana needs to vote out Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, and the second ad features Trump praising Rispone.\n\nHELLO FROM THE OUTSIDE \u2014 Senate Leadership Fund and One Nation are planning for an absolutely massive cycle. The GOP-aligned outside groups \u201chave budgeted approximately $190 million to protect McConnell\u2019s most endangered incumbents:\u201d Sens. Collins, Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), McSally and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Sens. Ernst and David Perdue (R-Ga.), if necessary, The Washington Examiner\u2019s David Drucker reported.\n\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cImagine Bernie now with 100 percent blood flow,\u201d Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver on his expected return to the trail to POLITICO.\n\nFollow us on Twitter Steven Shepard @politico_steve\n\n\n\nZach Montellaro @zachmontellaro\n\n\n\nJames Arkin @jamesarkin\n\n\n\nLaura Barron-Lopez @lbarronlopez\n\n\n\nDaniel Strauss @danielstrauss4\n\n\n\nAlly Mutnick @allymutnick", "description": "Biden\u2019s cash crunch \u2014 ActBlue comes through again for Democrats", "authors": ["Follow Us On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
