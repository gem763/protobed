Police made the grisly discovery after responding to reports of numerous dead males observed on a roadway in the pacific coast state of Guerrero.\n\nPolice in the municipality of Zitala, located in the remote mountain communities northeast of Chilpancingo, responded to emergency calls regarding several deceased males lying in the roadway along the Zitlala-Pochahuizco highway. The road is situated in the town of Pochahuitzuco adjacent to Chilapa.\n\nUpon arrival, police discovered nine dead males who suffered multiple gunshot wounds lying in the roadway. Investigators from the state attorney general\u2019s office responded to the crime scene and found more than 50 spent shell cashing from numerous rifles and various calibers scattered around the crime scene, according to a local media report.\n\nPreliminary information released by investigators indicated that the nine murder victims are members of Los Rojos, a criminal gang that operates in the state of Guerrero and Morelos with a home base in Chilpancingo.\n\nThe nine victims are believed to be cartel gunmen for the current leader of Los Rojos Zenen Nava S\u00e1nchez. In August of this year, Mexican security elements in the state of Guerrero captured Los Rojos former leader Santiago Mazari Hern\u00e1ndez, alias \u201cEl Carrete,\u201d one of Mexico\u2019s most sought after fugitives. \u201cEl Carrete\u201d and his criminal gang are believed to be responsible for much of the violence generated in Guerrero and the neighboring state of Morelos.\n\nLos Rojos, under the leadership of \u201cEl Carrete,\u201d were also implicated in the assassination of Temixco, Morelos, Mayor Gisela Mota Ocampo in January of 2016. Mayor Mota Ocampo was murdered the day after being sworn in as mayor when cartel shooters stormed her residence and shot her to death. Two of the killers were later captured and two others were killed in an ensuing chase and gun battle with police.\n\nLos Rojos are also suspected in the disappearance and murder of 43 students from Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers\u2019 College in Iguala, Guerrero, in 2014. Police rounded up the 43 students and handed them over to Los Rojo\u2019s operatives who later murdered them\u2013the case is known as the Iguala Massacre.\n\nRobert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs.
