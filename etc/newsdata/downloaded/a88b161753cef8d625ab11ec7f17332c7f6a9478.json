I\u2019ll not look at it some other time.\u201d\n\nBleacher Report declined to make the animator of the weekly series available for an interview, but several Lions players shared their dislike for the piece on social media.\n\n\u201cWtf is this\u201d? running back Kerryon Johnson tweeted.\n\n\u201cJust some lowlife who has nothing better to do,\u201d responded safety Tracy Walker.\n\nStafford is off to a nice start this season after a disappointing 2018.\n\nHe has a career-high 102.6 passer rating and nine touchdowns against two interceptions, and the Lions are 2-1-1 and in second place in the NFC North.\n\nStafford said the hip injury he played through in a Week 4 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs \u201cfeels good\u201d and \u201cfeels better\u201d after last week\u2019s bye, and he said \u201chope not\u201d when asked if he expects it to be an issue going forward.\n\n\u201cTough to say (how much it affected me against the Chiefs),\u201d he said. \u201cI just, I was out there, I\u2019m going to be out there as much as I possibly can, you guys know that, so I was just out there playing. Felt good enough to go out and play and execute at a decent level.\u201d\n\nFor the Lions to beat the Packers for the third straight time at Lambeau Field, something that hasn\u2019t happened since 1986-88, they\u2019ll need Stafford to play at an even higher level than he has through the season\u2019s first four weeks.\n\nThe Packers rank among the NFL leaders in scoring defense and are tied for the NFL lead in turnover margin. They have seven interceptions and four fumble recoveries this season, and have done a good job forcing quarterback fumbles with their pass rush.\n\n\u201cI think their front four or front five, however many guys they want to rush, do a great job of affecting the quarterback\u2019s pocket,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been stripping the ball from the quarterback, they\u2019ve also been getting interceptions in the back end. That\u2019s both scheme and players.\u201d\n\nLions offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell called the Packers' defense one \u201cthat really thrives\u201d on creating turnovers, and said limiting turnovers has been an emphasis for his offense this week.\n\nStafford, who has lost two fumbles and has thrown two interceptions this season, said that is a personal focus for the next 12 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely important,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery single game you go play in, turnovers are the No. 1 leading stat in determining the outcome of the game. The more that we can retain the ball and then get it back from their offense, the better we\u2019re going to be.\u201d\n\nFollow Dave Birkett on Twitter @davebirkett", "description": "Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford ignored video spoofing him as Joker, and says his hip injury feels better after a week of rest.", "authors": ["Dave Birkett", "Published A.M.
