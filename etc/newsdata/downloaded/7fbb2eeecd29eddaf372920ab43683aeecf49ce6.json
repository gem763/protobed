California investigators didn't give up on her case", "language": "en", "text": "Southern California investigators have solved the murder of an 11-year-old girl, nearly five decades after her Thanksgiving Day kidnapping.\n\nGenetic genealogy identified Jake Edward Brown, who died in 2003, as the man responsible for the disappearance and death of Terri Lynn Hollis, authorities said Wednesday. She vanished from her family's home in Torrance, near Los Angeles, on Nov. 23, 1972. Fishermen found Hollis, wearing only a T-shirt, on a cliff below the Pacific Coast Highway in Oxnard the next day.\n\n\u201cThis crime is what nightmares are made of, and no family should ever have to go through such a tragedy,\u201d Torrance Police Chief Eve Irvine said at a news conference.\n\nAfter 2,000 interviews over nearly half a century, Irvine said an analysis of public databases by Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs Inc. led them to a relative of Brown. Police had preserved a DNA sample from Hollis' body, and it matched. Authorities then dug up Brown's body in Arizona to confirm the connection.\n\nEvidence: Here's how one yellow sock helped solve a 28-year-old cold case murder\n\nThe same DNA investigation technique has helped investigators crack numerous cold cases, from California to Pennsylvania, with evidence from old socks to razors.\n\nBrown had been arrested in two rape cases after Hollis' death, Irvine said, and police are investigating whether he may be responsible for other unsolved crimes. He also had multiple addresses and went by an alias.\n\nRandy Hollis, who was 16 when his younger sister was killed, teared up as he thanked police and urged families searching for answers not to lose hope. He said he still mourns his sister every Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it, 47 years, it\u2019s amazing that we\u2019ve come to this day,\u201d he said. \u201cI only wish that my parents were still alive to see this.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: California cold case: DNA solves Terri Lynn Hollis' 1972 murder", "description": "Investigators solved the killing of an 11-year-old girl in Southern California 47 years after her kidnapping through DNA evidence, authorities said.", "authors": ["Kristin Lam", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/91lqrmUvNQFe_60NmeXhww--~B/aD0zODE3O3c9NTU4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/6f1c39ec9fae5c195bbbe9930520ae6f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
