At the same time, Abe gave a cold shoulder to South Korea amid tensions over wartime history.\n\nInterested in Japan? Add Japan as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Japan news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn a policy speech opening the parliamentary session, Abe said he will take any chance to meet Kim.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m determined to face Chairman Kim Jong Un, without attaching any preconditions,\u201d Abe said, after changing his policy earlier this year. \u201cBased on a level-headed analysis, I will act decisively so that I won\u2019t miss any chance.\u201d\n\nAbe used to say he would meet Kim only when there is progress on denuclearization and the decades-old issue of Japanese citizens abducted to North Korea. But he changed his tune after other regional leaders, including those in China, South Korea and Russia, choose to meet Kim.\n\nNorth Korea has resumed missile tests following the February collapse of its summit with the United States. The latest was a test-firing Wednesday of an underwater-launched missile, parts of which fell inside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone. The U.S. talks resume Saturday in Stockholm.\n\n\u201cRegarding the current North Korea situation, we will do the utmost to protect the safety of the people as we will closely cooperate with the U.S. and the international community,\u201d Abe said.\n\nWhile maintaining its alliance with the U.S. as a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of diplomacy and security, Japan will also \u201cjoin hands with countries that it shares fundamental values, such as Britain, France, Australia and India, to achieve free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d Abe said.\n\nUnlike in the past, Abe did not mention South Korea in the context of cooperation on North Korean missile and nuclear threats.\n\nHe only repeated that South Korea must withdraw demands for Japanese wartime compensation beyond what was already paid under the peace treaty. \u201cSouth Korea is an important neighbor. I urge (South Korea) to keep promises between countries under the international law,\u201d he said.\n\nRelations between the U.S. allies deteriorated rapidly since July over the issue of Korean laborers abused by Japanese companies during World War II, as well as Japan\u2019s export controls for materials crucial for South Korean industries. It prompted Seoul to announce in late August it would terminate a bilateral military intelligence pact.\n\nAbe said economy is also his policy priority. Japan will take a leadership to promote \u201cfree, fair and rule-based trade zones across the world,\u201d he said.\n\nAt home, Abe is pushing harder to amend Japan\u2019s war-renouncing constitution.\n\nAbe and his right-wing supporters have long campaigned to revise the U.S.-drafted war-renouncing constitution, as they see it as a legacy of Japan's World War II defeat and humiliation during the U.S. occupation.\n\nHis constitution campaign, however, has struggled amid voter concern about the economy and social security. Hurdles to achieve his long-cherished goal are high \u2014 two-thirds approval in both houses of the parliament to propose a revision before a national referendum. Abe\u2019s party and supporters of a revision have two-thirds in the lower house, but lost the benchmark in the other chamber in the July election.\n\nAbe\u2019s current term ends in September 2021, unless his party revises its rule again to allow him to seek a fourth term.\n\nAbe now proposes a revision to Article 9 by specifying Japan's Self-Defense Force as the country's legitimate military as a way to gain broader support. He says opposition lawmakers should at least join discussion of a change.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
