Around 50 doctors are on call for those with health problems and there's a special security area where women can find protection from harassment, dpa reported.\n\nE-scooters, which were legalized in Germany earlier this year, are banned inside and around the Oktoberfest grounds and plenty of traffic controls were established outside to prevent drunken driving after the party's over.\n\nAs in previous years, beer prices were up again, with a liter mug costing up to 11.80 euros ($13) \u2014 a 30-cent increase over last year.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
