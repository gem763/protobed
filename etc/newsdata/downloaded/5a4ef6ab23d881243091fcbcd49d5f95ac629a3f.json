We do think there's a good way forward. We do think there's a good solution.\"\n\nIrish politicians have come out against the reported plan for customers clearance centers back from the border. Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee told Irish radio station Newstalk the proposals were unacceptable. \"If this is what is being proposed next week it won\u2019t be acceptable ... This will never be acceptable to people on this island \u2026 It will completely disrupt the flow of our economy,\" she said.\n\nJohnson said Brussels and Dublin were \"not talking about the proposals that we're actually going to be taking, they're talking about some stuff that went in previously.\"\n\nIreland's Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney called the idea a \"non-starter.\"\n\nJohnson told Today that the U.K. would bring forward its full, formal proposal for replacing the Northern Ireland backstop element of the Brexit deal \"shortly.\"\n\nHe confirmed U.K. plans to permit Northern Ireland to operate under EU rules affecting agriculture to enable the continuation of the all-island economy in this area, and insisted the U.K. and the EU were making headway in talks.\n\n\"We\u2019ve made progress since the beginning of August \u2026 I don\u2019t want to anticipate where the talks are going to go now. I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll get there,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe prime minister also denied that the U.K. was urging EU leaders to insist, if a deal is struck, that there could be no further extensions. But he said that the U.K. being kept in the bloc against the will of his government would be bad for both sides, and refused to deny that Britain could act as a spoiler should it be forced to stay in the EU.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of common observation that the U.K. wants to come out \u2026 I don\u2019t think that any purpose is served by corralling the U.K. against its will in the EU,\" he said.\n\nEmilio Casalicchio contributed to this report.", "description": "British prime minister refuses to deny that Britain could act as a spoiler should it be forced to stay in the EU against his government\u2019s will.", "authors": ["Annabelle Dickson", "Charlie Cooper", "Jack Blanchard", "Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1172700054-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
