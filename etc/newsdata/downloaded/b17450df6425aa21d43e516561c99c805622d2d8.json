The holding, owned directly and through emerging market exchange-traded funds, would be worth $24 million at that share count.\n\nThe New York State Teachers Retirement System also owned Hikvision, reporting 81,802 shares at the end of June, up from 26,402 shares at the end of 2018, fund disclosures show.\n\n\u201cOur holdings are primarily held according to their weights in passive portfolios matching the MSCI ACWI ex-U.S. index, our policy benchmark. We are monitoring the situation,\u201d said a spokesman for the teachers' fund. The ex-U.S. All Country World Index includes stocks from 22 developed and emerging markets.\n\nThe blacklisting means Hikvision and the other companies will not be able to buy U.S. technology, such as software and microchips, without specific U.S. government approval. It does not prevent U.S. investors from buying the companies' shares.\n\nIn August, Hikvision had been banned from selling to U.S. federal agencies because the government said its products could allow access to sensitive systems.\n\nHikvision's General Manager Hu Yangzhong told Reuters on Wednesday it has been talking to the U.S. government about Xinjiang and has hired human rights lawyers to defend itself against the blacklisting.\n\nA spokeswoman for law firm Sidley Austin LLP, which has lobbied for Hikvision this year, declined to comment.\n\nAnother major fund investing in Hikvision shares is the Florida Retirement System (FRS), with 1.8 million shares at the end of June.\n\nA spokesman for the fund said it was working closely with external money managers \"related to the issue in order to meet all regulatory and fiduciary requirements.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPOSTER CHILD\n\nRisk consultants say the ease with which money used for the retirements of tens of millions of Americans is being invested in such companies should concern U.S. authorities at every level, as well as Americans generally.\n\n\"Hikvision has emerged as the corporate poster child for enabling Chinese human rights abuses, with its surveillance cameras visible atop the walls of detention camps incarcerating some one million or more Uighurs in Xinjiang,\" said Roger Robinson, president and CEO of Washington DC-based risk consultancy RWR Advisory Group.\n\nBeijing denies any mistreatment of people at the camps, which it says provide vocational training to help stamp out religious extremism and teach new work skills.\n\nRobinson said that many Americans are unwittingly owning shares in such companies because they are in index funds. \"They are picked up by the index providers in sizable numbers and sluiced into U.S. investor portfolios with seemingly very little, if any, due diligence or disclosure in the categories of national security and human rights.\"\n\nMSCI Inc, whose products are designed for global investors, added Hikvision to its benchmark emerging markets index last year. MSCI declined to comment.\n\nOne other company among the blacklisted eight that is owned by some of the big pension funds is iFlytek Co Ltd, a speech-recognition firm. Its shares were owned by funds in Florida, New York State as well as CalSTRS and the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) indirectly through the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF at their last disclosure dates. IShares, a top ETF provider owned by BlackRock Inc , declined to comment.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Some of the biggest public pensions funds in the United States have invested in one of the world's largest purveyors of video surveillance systems that the U.S. government claims are used in wide-scale repression of the Muslim population of western China.
