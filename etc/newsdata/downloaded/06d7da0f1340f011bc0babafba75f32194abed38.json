No. You\u2019d probably wash it off with water. And it\u2019s for similar reasons that people worldwide use bidets to clean themselves after using the bathroom. In western Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. They\u2019re cleaner and more environmentally friendly than just plain old toilet paper. But there\u2019s one place where bidets are not so welcome, which made us wonder: Why haven\u2019t they caught on in the US?\n\nThe word bidet actually means \u201cpony\u201d or \u201csmall horse\u201d in French, since using a bidet is similar to straddling a pony. And it\u2019s in France that the first known bidet appeared, in the 1700s. But using water for cleansing had been around long before that. The Middle East, South Asia, and other regions had been using small vessels of water \u2013 called lotas or tabo \u2013 for cleansing for centuries before bidets appeared.\n\nPeople would scoop the water with their hands to wash themselves off. At first, it was mostly for the upper class, but by the 19th century, indoor plumbing led to the bidets we have today. You might describe it as a really low sink next to the toilet. Its popularity spread from France to all across Europe and other parts of the world, except for America.\n\nPart of the reason is that bidets got a bad reputation. Americans first saw them in World War II in European brothels, so, many associated them with sex work. By the time Arnold Cohen tried to introduce them to America in the 1960s, it was too late. He couldn\u2019t seem to defeat the stigma, and he quickly discovered that no one really wanted \u201cto hear about Tushy Washing 101.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Japan was taking bidets to the next level. Toto, a Japanese company, made some of its bidets electric. So, why hasn\u2019t America embraced the bidet? Well, bathrooms in the US aren\u2019t really built for bidets. There\u2019s no space or additional plumbing setup for bidet fixtures. But the biggest reason it hasn\u2019t caught on comes down to habit. Most Americans grew up using toilet paper. And many might not even know there\u2019s an alternative way to stay clean.\n\nBut using a bidet actually makes a huge difference. For one, it\u2019s more environmentally friendly. The bidet uses only one-eighth of a gallon of water, while it takes about 37 gallons of water to make a single roll of toilet paper. Americans spend $US40 to $US70 a year on average for toilet paper and use approximately 34 million rolls of toilet paper a day. Investing in a bidet seat or bidet attachment can lower your spending on toilet paper by 75% or more. You\u2019ll also be saving some of the 384 trees that are cut down to make a single person\u2019s lifetime toilet-paper supply.\n\nBy now, you might be wondering about wet wipes. Don\u2019t they do pretty much the same thing? Well, no. Constantly wiping can irritate the skin and give you rashes. And it can still leave residue, because you\u2019re really just smearing with paper. Not only that, but wet wipes are actually harmful to the ocean and can cause sewer damage.\n\nBut washing yourself with a bidet can help with cleanliness, which may lead to fewer instances of rashes, hemorrhoids, urinary tract infections, and other medical issues. And if you\u2019re worried about using toilet water to clean your back end, you shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s tap water. Just like the water from your sink.\n\nSo give the bidet a try. Maybe start off with a toilet-seat attachment. Because, in the end, it\u2019s just washing yourself without hopping into the shower!\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
