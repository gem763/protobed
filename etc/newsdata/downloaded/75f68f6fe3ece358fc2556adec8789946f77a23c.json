He hired his campaign aides to run the entity, which pushed his agenda \u2014 namely expanding pre-kindergarten to all 4-year-olds \u2014 on a budget fueled by contributions that circumvented electoral campaign donation limits.\n\nBrookfield Financial Properties \u2014 which gave Campaign for One New York $50,000 on May 22, 2015 while it was also lobbying the city \u2014 agreed to pay $30,000. \u201cEvidence indicates that the donation was made subsequent to a recommendation made by or on behalf of the mayor to an executive associated with\u201d Brookfield, the commission determined.\n\nToll Brothers and a subsidiary agreed to pay $15,000. The company was lobbying the city at the time it gave $25,000 after a personal request from de Blasio in March of 2015, according to the commission.\n\nGreenpoint Landing Developers, a company affiliated with Park Tower Group, also was lobbying the city at the time an executive donated $50,000 to the Campaign for One New York at the request of a mayoral fundraiser. The company agreed to pay $20,000.\n\n\"Fundraising for the now-defunct Campaign for One New York has been thoroughly investigated by JCOPE,\" said mayoral spokesperson Freddi Goldstein in an emailed statement. \"JCOPE has never found that the Mayor violated the law.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the development firms did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDe Blasio shut down the organization in 2016, after the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan had begun investigating whether it had taken donations from entities with business before the city. He transferred remaining funds to another nonprofit set up to bolster his housing agenda.\n\nThe mayor's campaign finance issues have continued into his bid for the White House. At least two complaints have been filed with the Federal Election Commission requesting it look into de Blasio's use of a state political action committee that doubled as a presidential exploratory committee, potentially in violation of FEC rules.\n\nThe mayor and his staff were not charged in the 2016 probe, but prosecutors declared de Blasio had sought donations from people looking for favors from his administration, and concluded \"the mayor made or directed inquiries to relevant city agencies on behalf of those donors.\"\n\nThe state commission said its investigation is ongoing.", "description": "And the mayor's campaign finance issues have continued into his bid for the White House.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3a/83/e354a047438a94757b10986b9961/0919deblas.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
