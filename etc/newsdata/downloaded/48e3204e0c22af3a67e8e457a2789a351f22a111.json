The co-founder of Grovehouse and owner of Brooklyn restaurants Lilia and Mis, recently joined Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Final Round to discuss his switch.\n\n\u201cMy thirteen years in finance, from 2003 until 2016, I measured my professional success base on a finite set of goals I set myself...and sometimes if I didn\u2019t hit those goals I would reflect and I would always come to the same conclusion of you\u2019re in this too deep you can\u2019t get out. And even if you wanted to try to start over, what could you possibly do. And finally when the restaurant did open up I realized that \u2018well I can do something else actually,\u2019\u201d Feeney said.\n\nA photo of the Sheeps Milk Cheese Filled Agnolotti at Lilia in Brooklyn More\n\nBefore working full time at Lilia and Misi, Feeney worked on Wall Street at big firms including Cantor Fitzgerald, Goldman Sachs, and Anchorage Capital. He said he credits his career change to a belief in his business partner Missy Robbins.\n\n\u201cWhen I decided to do this restaurant thing it started with a belief in somebody else, my partner Missy Robbins. I did not think at that time when she finally said yes to become my partner that it was going change my life the way it did,\u201d Feeney said.\n\nFeeney said his goal in the industry has always been to find the perfect balance between art and commerce. Feeney said finding the balance \u201cis not necessarily to eek out the most profit margins \u2014 it\u2019s essentially to make it as efficient an operation as possible and [Missy Robbins] has the greatest canvas in front of her to paint on.\u201d\n\nReservations for Lilia and Misi are able to be made on the restaurant reservation site, Resy. But, tables at these spots are in high demand so expect to wait up to a month to feast on Feeney and Robbins\u2019 pasta.\n\nFor everyone that asks Feeney why anyone would leave finance for the unpredictable work of restaurants, he simply says, \u201cthe margins in pasta are incredible.\u201d\n\nSara Dramer is an associate producer at Yahoo Finance.
