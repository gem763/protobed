Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nWhat Apple's latest product unveiling event lacked in surprises \u2013 as most of the news about new iPhones was leaked online ahead of Tuesday\u2019s media gathering \u2013 it made up for it with a host of impressive devices.\n\nYou no doubt heard about the just-unveiled iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro (and larger iPhone 11 Pro Max) \u2013 and be sure to read Ed Baig\u2019s coverage of the event here \u2013 but you might have missed some of the iPhone 11\u2019s lesser-known (but still intriguing) features, as well as info on other devices and services.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at five things you should know about Apple\u2019s new lineup.\n\nA way better battery\n\nWhile it might not be the sexiest of features to look for, any iPhone user will tell you battery performance is incredibly important.\n\nThe new 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro (from $999) and larger 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max (from $1,099) have a battery that lasts up to 4 hours longer than 2018\u2019s iPhone Xs and up to 5 hours longer than the iPhone Xs Max, respectively.\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\nAnd available on Sept. 20, iPhone 11 (from $699) also outperforms the battery in last year\u2019s iPhone XR by about an hour, the device maker says, getting through an \u201centire day\u201d on a single charge.\n\niPhone 11: Are Apple's latest iPhones worth the money?\n\nAirpods, 5G and binging Apple TV+: What Apple didn't talk about at its event\n\niPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro are also said to have the \u201ctoughest glass ever in a smartphone,\u201d says Apple, plus it\u2019s IP68 for water resistance up to 6.5 feet for up to 30 minutes.\n\nNight mode\n\nCatching up to other smartphone makers, Apple\u2019s Night mode dramatically improves the quality of photos in dimly-lit environments. (Photo: 2019 Apple Inc. All Rights Reserved.)\n\nYes, it\u2019s cool to have an ultrawide-angle lens to capture more detail on the iPhone 11 \u2013and the addition of a telephoto lens on the iPhone 11 Pro \u2013 but Apple needed to up its game in the low-light photography department. Google Pixel, Huawei and Samsung all excel here.\n\nWell, Apple now does, too, with its Night mode feature.\n\nA new wide-angle sensor enables much brighter images, with more natural colors and reduced noise (\u201cgrainy\u201d photos), Apple says, and offering up to three times faster autofocus in low light.\n\nEven better, you don\u2019t need to turn on this mode, which comes on all three new models. Apple says Night mode will be enabled automatically if the phone senses the photo is being taken in a dimly-lit environment, indoors or outdoors.\n\nAn \u201calways on\u201d Apple Watch\n\nApple Watch Series 5 is the first Apple Watch to offer an \u201calways on\u201d Retina display \u2013 without it impacting the battery. (Photo: 2019 Apple Inc. All Rights Reserved.)\n\nAs author of the book \"Apple Watch For Dummies\" (shameless plug, sorry), a common complaint from readers is wishing Apple Watch\u2019s display would always stay on, instead of turning to black after a few seconds, to help preserve battery life.\n\nUsers will now get that perk as Apple Watch Series 5 (from $399, available Sept. 20) is the first to have an always-on Retina display, therefore the watch face is always visible, to glance at the time and personalized \u201ccomplications\u201d (such as activity levels, weather, UV index, and more).\n\nOffering up to 18 hours of battery life, the Apple Watch screen intelligently dims when your wrist is down and returns to full brightness with a raise or a tap.\n\nMade from a wider range of materials (including aluminum, stainless steel, ceramic and titanium), Apple Watch Series 5 also introduces a built-in compass, so you can see which way you\u2019re facing when looking at maps, and get additional information in a Compass app.\n\nFor world travelers, those with the cellular versions of the watch can now complete international calls to emergency services, regardless of where the device was originally purchased (or if the cellular plan has been activated).\n\nInexpensive gaming, video services\n\nFor $4.99/month, Apple Arcade (launching Sept. 19) offers access to more than 100 exclusive games, including \"Skate City\" (shown here), playable on a number of Apple devices, with no ads or in-app purchases. (Photo: 2019 Apple Inc. All Rights Reserved.)\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t get as much coverage as the new hardware, Apple spent considerable time talking about new services \u2013 that won\u2019t break the bank.\n\nA gaming service called Apple Arcade will be available on the App Store beginning Sept. 19, with a subscription cost of $4.99 per month (after a one-month free trial). It gives gamers unlimited access to more than 100 new, exclusive games \u2013 all playable across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple TV \u2013 and all without in-app purchases or advertisements.\n\nApple TV+, the company's exclusive video streaming service, launches Nov. 1 with movies, documentaries and several original TV shows including 'Dickinson,' starring Hailee Steinfeld, shown here, as poet Emily Dickinson. (Photo: 2019 Apple Inc. All Rights Reserved.)\n\nAlso for $4.99 per month, Apple TV+ is a new video subscription service with all original shows, movies and documentaries, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d \u201cDickinson,\u201d \u201cThe Elephant Queen,\u201d and \u201cSee\u201d (with an extended trailer shown at the Apple event). Starting November 1, the service will be available on the Apple TV app on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod touch, Mac and other platforms.\n\nWhat\u2019s a slofie?\n\nWhile it made a splash among attendees at the Steve Jobs Theater, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much coverage of a fun new way to take slow-motion selfies \u2013 or \u201cslofies,\u201d for short.\n\nBy activating iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s Slo-Mo mode on the front-facing TrueDepth camera, you can shoot at 120 frames per second \u2013 perhaps while tossing your hair, making a funny face or capturing movement with your friends.\n\nWhat do you get when you cross a slow-motion video with a selfie? The answer is a \u2018slofie,\u2019 an Apple-coined term. This fun feature is available on all new iPhone 11 models. (Photo: 2019 Apple Inc.
