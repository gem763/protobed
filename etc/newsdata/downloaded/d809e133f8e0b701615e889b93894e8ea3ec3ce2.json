Don\u2019t believe everything you hear.\u201d\n\nHaving seen that summer move fail to materialise, Bale has made a handful of appearances for Los Blancos this season.\n\nAnd manager Zinedine Zidane maintains there are no underlying issues with the 30-year-old, who has also struggled with fitness issues since returning from international duty.\n\n\"He went to London on a personal matter and with the permission of the club. He talked to the club because he has a right to personal things,\" the Real Madrid coach said.\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\n\"You have to ask the club for permission, which is the most important thing. He also went because he's not available.\n\n\"It's a very simple matter. He asked the club for permission and the club gave it to him.\n\n\"We think that Bale is a player who puts in a lot of effort and trains well. He's important for this squad and for the club.\n\n\"When he's not available, he's not available because he's got something and that's it.\n\n\"There's a lot of talk and a lot of things said. When he's ready and 100 per cent, we'll see. He's focused on playing well for the team.\"", "description": "Having seen a China summer move fail to materialise, Bale has made a handful of appearances for Real Madrid this season", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Juan Carlos Hidalgo Epa-Efe Rex", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751140.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Real-Madrid-vs-Granada-Spain-05-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
