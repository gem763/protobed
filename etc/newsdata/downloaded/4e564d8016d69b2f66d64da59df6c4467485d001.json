Trump said he told Erdo\u011fan back then, \"Bullshit, a justice system. You own the justice system.\"\n\nThis time it's harder for Trump, though, because his initial statement effectively cleared the way for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s invasion.\n\nAnd Trump has doubled down and defended his decision to withdraw the U.S. from northern Syria on the grounds of ending \"endless wars.\" In other words, he\u2019s trying to sanction the cat after he let it out of the bag.\n\nThe state of play: Erdo\u011fan says he will only agree to a ceasefire when the Kurdish militia, whom he views as a terrorist group, surrenders and leaves the Turkish controlled areas in Syria, reports the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhat's next: Erdo\u011fan and Trump are set to meet in D.C. next month, but Erdo\u011fan told reporters that he is still weighing the visit because he feels the \"arguments, debates, conversations being held in Congress regarding my person, my family and my minister friends are a very big disrespect,\" per Reuters.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has also extended an invitation to Erdo\u011fan to visit in the next few days, reports Reuters.\n\nGo deeper: Pelosi and Graham team up to oppose Trump's Syria decision\n\nEditor's note: This story and headline have been updated to include the tweet from Erdo\u011fan's communications director.", "description": "\"When Trump comes here, I will talk to him.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/RGbW1giN75TwkV64eGyN6yPdTaY=/0x367:2835x1962/1920x1080/2019/10/16/1571226270772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
