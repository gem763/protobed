It lost its glacier status in 2014, when the ice became too thin to move.\n\nBut the problem of glacier loss caused by climate change is a global issue. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report warned that smaller glaciers in Europe, Africa, the Andes and Indonesia were projected to lose more than 80% of their current ice mass by 2100 if carbon emissions were high.\n\nThe resulting rise in sea level could have huge consequences for millions of people, the UN panel warned.\n\nImage copyright National Land Survey of Iceland Image caption This image of the Heinabergsj\u00f6kull glacier was taken in 1989\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The 2019 drone image shows that extent that the glacier has lowered over 30 years\n\nFollow Rebecca on Twitter.\n\nImages courtesy of National Land Survey of Iceland and Dr Kieran Baxter, University of Dundee", "description": "A photography project has highlighted the extent of ice loss from Iceland\u2019s largest glaciers.", "authors": ["Rebecca Morelle", "Science Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13D7B/production/_109357218_iceland_glaciers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
