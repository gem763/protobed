(Picture: AFP)\n\nBoris Johnson has made a last-minute plea to MPs to pass his new Brexit deal ahead of a historic showdown in the House of Commons.\n\nThe knife-edge vote is set to take place this afternoon \u2013 but there\u2019s a chance it may not go ahead at all.\n\nThe government announced this morning that they will send MPs home before the main Brexit deal vote if it the Letwin amendment passes.\n\nPut forward by former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin, this would try to force a delay to Brexit until all the legislation implementing the new deal has been passed.\n\nThis keeps the Benn Act extension in place until all the legal boxes are ticked and would prevent an \u2018accidental no-deal departure.\u2019\n\nThe Benn Act was passed by MPs earlier this year, and forced the government to seek a three month extension to the EU deadline if no new withdrawal agreement was made before October 31st.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAnalysts say the Letwin amendment looks likely to pass, with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour and other opposition parties set to back it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTory rebels Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Nick Boles are some prominent politicians who have signaled they will back it too.\n\nSupporters argue that were Parliament to approve the deal today, there might be a danger that the subsequent legislation to enact it might be somehow derailed, resulting in a no-deal exit on 31 October.\n\nIf the amendment does go through, the government will have to ask the EU for an extension tonight, following the provisions of the Benn Act.\n\nThat means the Prime Minister wouldn\u2019t be able to put his deal directly to MPs as a binary choice between his deal and a no-deal Brexit.\n\nLetwin said the amendment offers an \u2018insurance policy\u2019 that ensures there is an extension in the case the Brexit deal doesn\u2019t go through in time.\n\nHe argues it will prevent the UK unintentionally crashing out without a deal.\n\nLetwin says his amendment is an \u2018insurance policy\u2019 (Picture: AFP)\n\nEarlier today, a number 10 source said if the Letwin amendment passes, EU Council President Donald Tusk will be given a copy of Parliament\u2019s letter, but the government will continue to say to European leaders they want to get Brexit done on 31 October with the new deal.\n\nBBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg tweeted that if it passes, the government will try to bring meaningful vote on the whole withdrawal bill on Tuesday.\n\nThe Letwin amendment also invites the government to put forward a bill to implement their deal but with the opportunity for MPs to amend the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf passed, it means MPs could try and amend it to make it harder or, more likely, softer.\n\nIn theory, it\u2019s even possible that MPs could tweak it to make the deal dependent on a second referendum.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
