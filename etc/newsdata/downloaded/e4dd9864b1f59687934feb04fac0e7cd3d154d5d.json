Hospital doctors were baffled, until one cardiologist made a crucial link.\n\n\"He told me to squeeze his hand if I remembered having a red liquid during chemotherapy treatment,\" Kreena recalls.\n\nShe did. The diagnosis was acute heart failure and she was rushed to intensive care.\n\nHeart damage risk\n\nThanks to advances in treatments, more patients than ever are surviving cancer - but one in 10 are developing serious heart conditions, sometimes soon after finishing treatment, others years later.\n\nThe problem is caused by chemotherapy drugs damaging the heart muscle, meaning it can no longer pump properly - and this can lead to heart failure.\n\nIt's even given rise to a new medical specialty called cardio-oncology, which focuses on delivering cancer treatments safely.\n\nBut working out which patients will get heart damage, and which won't, has proved really tricky up until now.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Chemotherapy can be toxic to the heart muscle - but not everyone is affected\n\nScientists knew that the very young and the elderly were at high risk, but they've now found out that faulty genes also play a role in increasing risk in other people.\n\n\"Some have a gene to cause heart failure and they get a second hit from the chemo,\" explains Dr Alex Lyon, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College London.\n\n\"Most patients are told there's a small risk of heart problems.\"\n\nA study of 200 cancer patients with cancer-therapy-induced cardiomyopathy, or CCM, has pinpointed the genetic risk factors, paving the way for testing of patients before they start chemotherapy to find out who is at risk.\n\nThe good news is that drug treatments can reduce the risk of heart damage in these patients and close monitoring can pick up potential problems early, Dr Lyon says.\n\n'Pregnancy too dangerous'\n\nEven patients like Kreena, who were left fighting for breath, can return to live a normal life.\n\n\"My recovery is incredible,\" she says. \"I didn't think I'd be coming home.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nDuring two weeks in a Canadian hospital, she sent voice messages back to relatives, preparing them for the worst.\n\nAfter a two-month stay in the country on a no-salt diet and being cared for by her husband, her heart function had improved from 6% to 12%.\n\nIt was enough to allow Kreena to fly back to the UK, but that was just the start of her journey to recovery.\n\nMedication and intense rehab followed, which allowed her heart to creep back into a normal range of function.\n\nBut there was one thing she was told was too dangerous - having a baby would put too much strain on her heart.\n\n\"So we started to look at other options,\" she says.\n\n'I'm very grateful'\n\nA surrogate was found, and using her own embryos, her daughter was born and is now 16 months old.\n\n\"Next month, I'm climbing in the Himalayas. I'm living an extraordinary life and I'm very grateful,\" Kreena says.\n\n\"I thought I wouldn't see my 40th birthday, but now it's just two weeks away.\"\n\nHer expedition is part of of push to raise awareness of breast cancer in young women from the charity Coppa Feel, a cause that's important to her.\n\n\"More people are surviving cancer after chemo and more are getting secondary diseases.\n\n\"There's work to do educating patients and doctors.\"", "description": "Kreena developed heart failure after being treated for cancer - but has made a remarkable recovery.", "authors": ["Philippa Roxby", "Health Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BB42/production/_108883974_kreenadhiman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
