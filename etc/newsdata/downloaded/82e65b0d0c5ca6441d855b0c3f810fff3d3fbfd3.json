They plan to offer a broad portfolio of gambling products including online sports betting, fantasy sports, online poker, horse racing, free-to-play and casino games.\n\nFlutter and Stars \u2014 headquartered in Ireland and Canada respectively \u2014 racked up a combined $4.7 billion in revenue last year. Together, they boast around 4 million active users across more than 100 countries.\n\nThe two companies expect the merger to generate around $170 million in annual, pre-tax cost savings, and open up cross-selling opportunities. Flutter, which will own 55% of the combined group, expects the tie-up to boost its underlying earnings per share by 50% the year after the deal closes. It also anticipates a six-fold increase in its international sales.\n\nThe proposed merger gives Fox Sports, which partnered with Stars in May to provide sports betting in the US, the right to acquire an 18.5% stake in FanDuel in 2021. The option is an incentive for Fox to use its national media platform to grow the fantasy sports business, which Paddy Power bought for $465 million last year.\n\nRead more: Fantasy sports site DraftKings is looking to raise new funding at a $2 billion valuation", "description": "The owners of FanDuel and PokerStars have struck a $12 billion deal to create the world's biggest online betting group.
