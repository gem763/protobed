The band broke up the following year.\n\nStars are also said to be put under huge amounts of pressure to look good, according to Kim Min-seok, a former trainer with one of K-Pop's top three agencies, YG Entertainment.\n\nBack in 2016, Kim told Vice stars often face daily weigh-ins, strictly controlled diets and even cosmetic surgery.\n\nKim explained: \"If a girl has a bad face and a good body, the problem can be fixed with plastic surgery.\"\n\nCho Shin, assistant manager of international marketing at Warner Music Korea, added: \"Rather than natural looks and talents, K-pop is about being furnished - it's a product.\n\n\"That product could be molded into something impeccable.\"\n\nJenna Park, who runs S K-pop Entertainment, added that \"there's a bright side but also a really dark side to K-pop.\n\nShe alleged some music industry bosses are aggressively changing girl idols' appearances to make them look more Western.\n\nIn 2017, Oh My Girl star JinE confirmed she was taking a break from the girl group to seek treatment for anorexia.\n\nA statement from the band's management company explained: \"We will wholeheartedly support JinE while she rests and receives treatment.\n\n\"We apologize once more for bringing this sudden news to fans and ask that you continue to show Oh My Girl unchanging love and interest.\"\n\nJinE's permanent exit was confirmed weeks later.\n\n(Image: AFP)\n\nJust weeks ago, boyband superstars BTS rocked the industry by announcing they are taking an \"extended period of rest and relaxation.\"\n\nThe seven-piece group's management, Big Hit Entertainment, said the singers will use the time to \"recharge\" while members of the band have said they are looking forward to \"leading a normal ifel\".\n\n\"We would like to announce that for the first time since their debut, BTS will be going on an official and extended period of rest and relaxation...\n\n\"This period of rest will be an opportunity for the members of BTS, who have relentlessly driven themselves towards their goal since their debut, to recharge and prepare to present themselves anew as musicians and creators.\n\n\"This will also provide them with a chance to enjoy the ordinary lives of young people in their 20s, albeit briefly.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"During this time, the members will rest and recharge in their own personal ways.\n\n\"Should you have a chance encounter with a member of BTS while they are on vacation, we ask that you show consideration for their need to rest and enjoy their private time off.\n\n\"BTS will return refreshed and recharged to return all the love you have an continue to show them. Thank you.\"\n\n* Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.
