They feel like they're not really going to be heard.\n\n\"I do understand the NHS need to get their funding from somewhere, but I don't think that charging staff is really the answer.\"\n\nMedway NHS Trust has launched a new parking system at the hospital which has led to a two month delay for permits to arrive.\n\nThe costs are then deducted from their monthly pay packet.\n\nThere is also a park and ride scheme for staff, which Claire says she can't use because the last bus runs before she's finished a late shift.\n\n(Image: David Anstiss /Geograph)\n\nGary Lupton, Executive Director of Estates and Facilities, said: \u201cWe recently reviewed our staff car parking arrangements to allow us to better utilise our parking provision at the hospital and create a fairer system for all staff.\n\n\u201cThe new on-site parking eligibility criteria was created jointly by our staff and takes into account a number of factors, including the distance between staff members\u2019 home and the hospital.\n\n\"Obviously many of our staff work unsociable hours so parking permit options include night only permits which start from 4pm until 8am the following morning and weekend permits.\n\n\"The distance criteria does not apply to these applications. New staff members who apply for a permit are informed that the process can take up to four weeks and are offered a space at our offsite parking facility while their application is being processed.\n\n\u201cThe new parking permits came into effect in August and we had a settling in period where enforcement measures were not issued to staff who parked without valid permits.\n\n\"However, due to the large numbers of staff and some local residents who continued to park on site without permits, last week we introduced enforcement measures to enable staff with valid permits to be able to park onsite.\n\n\"This move was supported by staff who are paying for permits but unable to park due to non-compliant parking and the date of when these measures would begin was communicated widely across the Trust.\n\n\"In this particular case, we have cancelled the parking tickets that the staff member received.\u201d", "description": "Claire Maloney was fined \u00a3120 while she was under the knife at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent", "authors": ["Henry Goodwin", "Matt Leclere", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Swns", "Getty Images", "David Anstiss", "Geograph"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559270.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Parking-ticket.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
