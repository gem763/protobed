had previously pushed the mark close in a similar attempt at the Monza Formula One racetrack near MIlan in 2017.\n\nKipchoge ran 2:00:25 on that occasion, but added extra pacemakers and allowed fans to line the streets for this attempt.\n\nThe tweaks worked, with Kipchoge holding a consistent pace throughout the run, consistently tracking at about ten seconds below the two-hour barrier, bettering his previous mark to make history.\n\nKipchoge is the holder of the official marathon World Record, a time of 2:01:39 set at the Berlin Marathon last year.\n\nHe has won eight World Marathon Majors, and took marathon gold in Rio at the 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nWhereas Kipchoge lost steam in Italy and fell 25 seconds short despite a final kick, here he was on track right from the outset, aided by an all-star team of pacemakers and a pacing car.\n\nAnd the Kenyan completed his remarkable achievement with a flourish, charging over the finish line while pointing at the clock, safe in the knowledge that the achievement was his.\n\nKipchoge praised all those who supported him through the race, and also his family, who were in the crowd to watch on as Kipchoge broke the two hour mark.\n\n\u201cThey (my wife and kids) have given me so much support, I\u2019m happy they came here to witness history,\u201d Kipchoge said at the finish.\n\n\u201cThe positivity of sport, I want it
