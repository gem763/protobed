Even Jessica Biel, who executive produces and stars in the television adaptation of the hit 2015 podcast, was initially convinced that it was real.\n\n\u201cI just thought I missed it because our world is so insane that anything is possible really, right?\u201d Biel told Variety at the premiere screening at the Hollywood Athletic Club on Tuesday night. \u201cIt was definitely a swift learning curve of okay, this is not real, but it\u2019s so fascinating. And we are right at the cusp of maybe this could be real. The technology that we are talking about could possibly happen, so we should tell this story and we should talk about connectivity and how far do you go and what\u2019s too far? Those sorts of bigger themes are part of the reason why I was really interested in doing this thing.\u201d\n\nMore from Variety\n\nBiel plays the central character of Lia Haddock, a journalist and podcast host, who sets out to investigate why 326 residents of a neuroscience research facility vanished without a trace. The series explores larger issues surrounding the downsides of advanced technology and its impact on human interaction, issues that Biel explained are particularly concerning to her.\n\n\u201cEspecially because I have a child and children are growing up and iPads and tablets are part of their world,\u201d Biel said. \u201cThey know how to use these things; they get obsessed with these things and I think that scares me more than anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously a part of social media and I\u2019m trying to always find a good balance of that with my life,\u201d Biel continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m much more of a dinosaur. I\u2019d rather have a conversation over the phone or take someone to lunch or do something kind of old school like that. But it\u2019s scary, I really do think because of these young people and how easily it can be very isolating.\u201d\n\nFans of Biel\u2019s Emmy-nominated turn as Cora Tannetti in USA\u2019s \u201cThe Sinner\u201d shouldn\u2019t be surprised at the actress\u2019s ability to embrace darker material but showrunner Josh Applebaum revealed that some of her edgier story contributions even stunned him and podcast creators Skip Bronkie and Zack Ackers.\n\n\u201cShe had ideas that literally made me, Skip and Zack say, we\u2019re just going to step out of the room right now,\u201d Applebaum told Variety. \u201cThe boys were often shocked by her, Michelle [Purple, executive producer] and Rebecca [Thomas, director]\u2019s ideas. It was like, \u2018We\u2019re not taking credit for this!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that\u2019s really dark and morbid really came from her brain,\u201d added Biel\u2019s producing partner Michelle Purple.\n\nPurple told Variety that Biel was drawn to the intrigue of the story and Lia\u2019s complicated character. \u201cI think it\u2019s exciting for her to try something different and to push herself and to scare herself and to see if she can go there and that\u2019s sort of the parts she looks for and wants to create for herself.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately, Bronkie and Ackers think that fans of the podcast \u2014 which hit No. 1 on iTunes within two months of its debut \u2014 will be pleased with its on-screen adaptation.\n\n\u201cI think they are going to love seeing Lia come to life,\u201d Akers told Variety. \u201cWhen you are listening to the podcast, it\u2019s just Lia\u2019s broadcast so you are only getting a sliver of her life and the world around her but with the show, we got to build that world and see what\u2019s happening and fill in the gaps from episode to episode that you couldn\u2019t see in the podcast.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I also think that people like the show because it\u2019s dark and it\u2019s interesting and it\u2019s scary and I think the television show is all of those things in ways that even people who are fans of the podcast won\u2019t expect,\u201d Bronkie added. \u201cI think they will like the DNA of our show if they are a fan of the podcast.\u201d\n\n\u201cLimetown\u201d is now available on .\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
