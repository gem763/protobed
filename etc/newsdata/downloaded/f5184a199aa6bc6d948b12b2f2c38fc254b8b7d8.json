The issue was whether the Trump campaign was working with Russian officials to acquire and disseminate information about her that could be used to tilt the 2016 election.\n\nDavid Rowe\n\nThe Downer revelations provided no evidence of collusion. In any case, Downer himself was never interviewed by the Mueller inquiry and the name Downer is confined to a few brief references in the final report.\n\nHow then to account for the FBI\u2019s decision during the Obama administration to open a counterintelligence operation against the Trump campaign?\n\nThat\u2019s an entirely legitimate question. As the Wall Street Journal has editorialised: \u201cAmericans need to know the real story, not merely the one leaked to a sympathetic media by former FBI and Obama administration officials.\u201d\n\nDo the answers lie in understanding more about Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that Democrats used to flog dirt about Trump and Russia?\n\nOr what about former British spy Christopher Steele\u2019s notorious dossier, supposedly based on Russian sources, which drove media hoopla about Trump-Russia collusion? It formed the basis for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, yet it was eventually shown to be full of wild, discredited and unsubstantiated claims about Trump\u2019s ties to the Kremlin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould there have been any surveillance warrants and ambush interviews for Trump aides if the dodgy Steele dossier had never existed?\n\nDid the FBI, led by a small number of officials under former director James Comey, take sides in a presidential election based on foreign propaganda sexed up by the opponents of Trump? What was the nature of the relationship between the FBI and former CIA Director John Brennan and the Obama White House?\n\nThe Mueller report shied away from these questions, but it is legitimate for some body in government to investigate the investigators. Indeed, it\u2019s been well known for months that the Justice Department has been bent on investigating what happened in 2016.\n\nIt is also standard practice for US prosecutors to seek help from foreign governments. So, for Attorney General Barr to consult the Australian or any other government or Trump talking to Morrison about these matters is not a problem.\n\nHowever, Trump putting the strong arm on the Ukrainian president to help him win in 2020 is a different matter altogether. It was poor judgment, perhaps illegal, and very different from the conversations regarding the origins of the Russia probe.\n\nThe problem is such distinctions are difficult to make in Washington\u2019s super-heated political environment.\n\nThe sad reality is that many Democrats and their media mates have never accepted Trump\u2019s shock election victory in 2016. By trying to blend the 2016 Russia probe and the 2019 Ukrainian call together, Trump\u2019s opponents are showing their motivated bias. That just makes the polarisation that engulfs Washington even more toxic.", "description": "Just why was the US government spying on the Trump campaign?
