It was called Isaac.\n\nKasbar, 19, did not get far with the animal, that is native to Madagascar. Perhaps overcome with regret, or else no longer in need of a primate companion, he left the animal in a plastic box outside of a hotel in Newport Beach. He wrote a note that said: \u201cThis belongs to the Santa Ana Zoo it was taken last night. Please bring it to police.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He was also ordered to pay $8,486 (\u00a36,598.69) in restitution to the zoo.\n\n\u201cHe broke into the Santa Ana Zoo on July 27, 2018 after it had closed for the day,\u201d said a statement issued by prosecutors in California. \u201cHe then used bolt cutters to cut a hole in the zoo\u2019s enclosures for lemurs and capuchin monkeys, which enabled several of the animals to escape, though they were later recovered.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They are endangered, in part, because of the illegal pet trade, according to court papers.\n\nEarlier this year, a lawyer for Kasbar, Brian Gurwitz, told NBC News his client had intended to keep the lemur as a pet and then was struck by what he had done.\n\n\u201cHe quickly realised it was a bad decision, and he took steps that night to ensure that it would be returned safely to the zoo,\u201d said Mr Gurwitz. \u201cIt was a poor youthful decision made by a high school student.\u201d", "description": "When Aquinas Kasbar used bolt cutters to snip through a cage at Santa Ana Zoo and remove a lemur, he did not steal any old primate.
