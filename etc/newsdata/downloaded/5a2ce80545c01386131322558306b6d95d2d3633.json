It\u2019s the Australian Football League\u2019s grand final championship.\n\nMillions more will watch on television in Australia for the mid-afternoon start between the favored Richmond Tigers and the upstart Greater Western Sydney Giants. Expatriate fans around the world may have to stay up half the night or get up early to watch it. On the east coast of the United States, it\u2019ll kick off at 12:30 a.m., in London at 5:30 a.m.\n\nHere are a few other things to know about the AFL\u2019s title match:\n\nTRADITION VS. THE (RELATIVELY) NEW GUYS\n\nRichmond will be attempting to win its second grand final in three years after beating Adelaide in 2017, the Tigers\u2019 first championship since 1980. Richmond has won 11 titles in the AFL or its predecessor, the Victorian Football League, the first in 1920. The Giants, meanwhile, have only been in the league since 2012, when they won only two matches and lost by more than 100 points five times. But they\u2019ve made steady improvements, making the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year this season.\n\nVARYING ROUTES\n\nThe Tigers dropped as low as ninth but finished in third place and have won 11 consecutive games, the second-best streak in club history. Greater Western Sydney has done it the hard way, finishing sixth and defeating the Western Bulldogs, Brisbane and Collingwood in elimination matches in the playoffs.\n\nThis season, they split their two matches, each winning at home. The Giants beat Richmond 19.11 (125) to 10.16 (76) in the third round and Richmond defeated Greater Western Sydney 13.16 (94) to 9.13 (67) in the 17th. For those not familiar with the scoring system in Australian rules football, the first figure refers to a six-point goal which is kicked between the uprights, the second figure a one-point behind.\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nRichmond: Shane Edwards is a 30-year-old midfielder/forward who has played 252 games for the Tigers, kicking 160 goals. He is also known as a strong playmaker, setting up his teammates with flicks and handballs. Richmond\u2019s forward line, with one of Tom Lynch, Jack Riewoldt or Dustin Martin as the deepest forward, often catches opposition defenses off-guard.\n\nGreater Western Sydney: Phil Davis, Nick Haynes, Sam Taylor and Heath Shaw are part of the Giants\u2019 defensive unit and are known for their ability to intercept kicks and passes. Full forward Jeremy Cameron has had a strong recent record against Richmond, booting 10 goals in their two matches this year.\n\nWHO WILL WIN?\n\nA preview on the Australian Football League\u2019s website says Richmond will win by 14 points. Most Melbourne media are also predicting a win for the inner-city Richmond club - they don\u2019t like it when a team from outside the \u201chome\u201d city of Australian rules football wins. Last year, the Perth-based West Coast Eagles beat another Melbourne side, Collingwood, in the grand final. Two in a row from outside Melbourne would not sit well.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Up to 100,000 spectators are expected to cram the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday for a match that never fails to cause flutters in the hearts of Aussie rules football fans.
