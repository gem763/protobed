There\u2019s only one brother, Charles, still active in politics now, after David died this summer.\n\nOver their lives, the brothers and their network have spent hundreds of millions of dollars backing interests such as the fossil fuel industry, and trying to keep government out of areas such as healthcare. In the 2016 cycle, they spent an estimated $1bn \u2013 the same as the Republican and Democratic parties each did.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just on the right where big money buys a seat at the table.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAmong the 12 Democrats taking part in the party\u2019s fifth debate was Tom Steyer, the 62-year-old hedge funder said to be worth $1.6bn.\n\nSteyer has spent around $30m of his own money to boost his name recognition. By contrast, his campaign raised just $2m in the year\u2019s third quarter \u2013 a paltry sum compared to Bernie Sanders\u2019s $25m, and less than half the $4.8m collected by long shot Amy Klobuchar.\n\nThe spending was enough to get Steyer through the Democratic National Committee\u2019s qualification rules \u2013 a score of at least two per cent in two recognised polls, and 130,000 unique donors from 20 states. Essentially, he bought his way onto the stage.\n\nThis has not escaped the notice of his rivals. \u201cHis ability to spend millions of his personal wealth has helped him gain in the polls like no one else,\u201d senator Cory Booker said in an email to supporters.\n\nMost Americans will tell you they don\u2019t think big money should have such a place in politics, and for a long time, members of both parties worked to regulate it. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 sought to drive so-called \u201csoft money\u201d out of campaigns; it also included the so-called \u201dstand by your ad provision\u201d, which is why official campaign ads contain the words \u201cI\u2019m [insert name of candidate here] and I support this advert\u201d.\n\nYet the guts of the bill were ripped out in 2010 by the Supreme Court, which found that the free speech clause of the first amendment prohibits the government from regulating how much money can be spent on politics.\n\nSince then, the taps have been open on both sides, though most of the Democratic candidates have declared they will not take corporate money. At the same time, another billionaire, Michael Bloomberg, has said he is reconsidering his decision not to run.\n\nEveryone who watched Tuesday night\u2019s debate will have their own views on Steyer\u2019s merits as a candidate. What\u2019s not a matter of opinion is whether the way he got to the stage was fair. It was not.\n\nYours,\n\nAndrew Buncombe\n\nChief US correspondent", "description": "For as long as anyone can remember, progressives have loved to complain about the pernicious influence of the billionaire Koch brothers.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/16/steyer-letter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
