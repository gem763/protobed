Timed tickets control the crush inside, but the place is still packed. The strain on the museum\u2019s online reservation site is such that the Louvre is apologizing for the delays, and it\u2019s difficult to get tickets before December.\n\nAD\n\nIn the months leading up to last week\u2019s public opening, the exhibition was engulfed in the din of what Saul Bellow called \u201cevent glamour.\u201d Thirteen years in the making, the show was plagued by obstacles and all but suffocated by intrigue and hype.\n\nAD\n\n(You want to mount a Leonardo exhibition? Knock yourself out. Understand first, though, that you\u2019ll have to beg to borrow works from a Saudi despot, the Queen of England, Bill Gates, and the U.S. and Russian governments; defeat a bunch of Italian nationalists in court; and placate a gang of Leonardo experts as vicious and territorial as stoats.)\n\nThe result is nonetheless magnificent. It may be decades before anything like \u201cL\u00e9onard de Vinci\u201d is staged again. So, for all the hype surrounding it, the exhibition offers a precious opportunity to find a bit of focus in the fog, to draw something substantial out of the sfumato. Who was this elusive genius? How did his mind work? What, among the things he left behind, still presses in on us today?\n\nAD\n\nIn Paris, in a state of high anticipatory excitement, I had plenty of time to ponder these questions. Standing with the crowds outside the Louvre\u2019s Pyramid and then, inside the exhibition, craning to see over the curling locks and bald pates of fellow patrons, I remembered a passage Leonardo penned about the dynamics of crowds.\n\n\u201cAll the bystanders at an event worthy of note adopt various gestures of admiration,\u201d he wrote in his treatise on painting, the Codex Urbinas. \u201cAnd if the event is of a devotional kind all the onlookers direct their eyes with various expressions of devotion toward [it].\u201d\n\nWith this in mind, I found myself inside the dark, devotional galleries paying special attention to the gestures, expressions and looks of blinking astonishment on the faces of my fellow patrons. All of us together seemed to be sharing unaccountable things, our inner lives linked by invisible filaments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWriting in 1869, the English essayist and art critic Walter Pater pictured Leonardo \u201ctracking the sources of expression to their subtlest retreats.\u201d He had it right, I think. For all his exemplary curiosity about the external world, Leonardo\u2019s deepest concern was to express the idea \u2014 the fact \u2014 of inner life, to stake a claim on the soul\u2019s inherent beauty.\n\nOne of the show\u2019s finest moments occurs in the very first gallery. At the center of the room stands a monumental bronze sculpture by Leonardo\u2019s teacher, Verrocchio, showing St. Thomas poking doubtfully at the wound in the risen Christ\u2019s torso. Both Jesus and Thomas wear flowing garments and are well beyond life-size. They are surrounded by a sweeping arc of Leonardo\u2019s drapery studies (in distemper brushed on primed linen).\n\nA subtler, more involving way to kick off the show is hard to imagine. It\u2019s as if we\u2019ve been deposited in a life drawing class, as students around a model. Like St. Thomas, we see up close the young Leonardo\u2019s studies, each one capturing in two dimensions a palpable, three-dimensional reality: the very same folds we can see in Verrocchio\u2019s sculpture.\n\nThe claim is often made that Leonardo\u2019s mind was too supple, active and curious to be contained by any single art form \u2014 even painting. This isn\u2019t true, according to the show\u2019s curators, Vincent Delieuvin and Louis Frank. They want us to let go of the idea of Leonardo as a freakish and fatally distracted polymath \u2014 inventor, naturalist, mathematician and so on \u2014 and recognize that painting was at the heart of all his endeavors. If they are right, as I\u2019m ready to believe they are, the question is only why he painted so little.\n\nWe are almost halfway into the exhibition before we see the first painting by Leonardo \u2014 the \u201cBenois Madonna\u201d from St. Petersburg. By the show\u2019s end, we have seen only six others. (The Mona Lisa would have taken the total to eight \u2014 out of a known total of about 14 or 15 \u2014 but in the interests of crowd control she has remained upstairs in the Louvre\u2019s Salle des Etats.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t other great things to see. The \u201cVitruvian Man,\u201d Leonardo\u2019s drawing of the body\u2019s ideal proportions, is here, a late arrival (after an Italian court order preventing its traveling was overturned). Alas, it will be in the show for only eight weeks. It\u2019s thrilling to be in the presence of one of the world\u2019s most reproduced art works (NASA even used a version of it as a patch on astronauts\u2019 space suits). The curators have placed it, almost insouciantly, at the back of a room full of Leonardo\u2019s scientific sketches and mathematical speculations.\n\nThere are also, among other wondrous things, an early landscape sketch; a marvelously animated study for the Madonna with the Fruit Bowl; one of Leonardo\u2019s beloved grotesque heads; two studies of yelling men for the lost painting, \u201cThe Battle of Anghiari;\u201d and a stupendous late drawing of the deluge.\n\nBut this show\u2019s explicit thesis is that, for Leonardo, what really counted was painting. It\u2019s well known that he carried a chip on his shoulder about his illegitimate birth, which cost him the chance to get a formal education. In a culture that had similarly failed to \u201clegitimate\u201d painting, he also resented the special pleading he had to do on the medium\u2019s behalf. Lacking a recognized niche in the hierarchy of the arts, painting \u201cwas left without advocates,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo why did he leave so few paintings behind? Was it indecisiveness? Distraction? A species of perfectionism that was always threatening to paralyze him?\n\nScientific analyses of the paintings, using infrared reflectology (full-scale images pepper the exhibition), show how heavily worked his paintings were. Oil paint was still relatively new in Italy, and Leonardo, who had seen what the great Flemish and Venetian artists \u2014 Jan van Eyck, Antonello da Messina and Giovanni Bellini \u2014 had done with it, loved the stuff. He was constantly revising compositions. And, as he came into his maturity and developed his famous \u201csfumato\u201d technique, he brushed on paint with increasing freedom.\n\nEvidence of his searching, intuitive approach is at odds with the image of a man who was too caught up in his own intellectual speculations to bother getting his hands dirty. But, of course, there are different kinds of fastidiousness. What stymied Leonardo more than anything, perhaps, was also the source of his originality: Simply put, he was allergic to cliche. Inherited subjects and traditional approaches failed to satisfy him. He was always looking for ways to make it new.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe was hardly alone in this. Restlessness in relation to tradition was a hallmark of the Renaissance. But the quality Leonardo brought to his restlessness was deeply peculiar. His centrality to the Renaissance is indisputable, but in front of much of his work \u2014 the \u201cSaint John the Baptist,\u201d the Mona Lisa, and both versions of the \u201cVirgin of the Rocks\u201d \u2014 you feel a strange eclipse obscuring the period\u2019s bright daylight.\n\nHis paintings in particular can produce a feeling analogous to what roboticists call \u201cthe uncanny valley\u201d \u2014 that charged, disturbing gap between the actually human and a convincing robotic stand-in. You could say this tension undergirds all great portraits. (No painting is a real person, after all.) And yet, in Leonardo the quality is different. The double whammy of naturalistic intensity and abstracted idealization does weird things to his subjects \u2014 and to their smiles in particular. Stare at the results \u2014 a painting like the \u201cBenois Madonna,\u201d for instance, or the late \u201cSaint John the Baptist\u201d \u2014 and you begin to fear that a bunch of internal wiring is about to start fizzing and snarling.\n\nApart from the Louvre\u2019s \u201cThe Virgin of the Rocks,\u201d Leonardo\u2019s greatest paintings were all portraits of women: the Mona Lisa, \u201cLa Belle Ferronni\u00e8re\u201d and \u201cLady with an Ermine.\u201d The best of the three, the fabulously erotic \u201cLady with an Ermine,\u201d has not traveled from its home in Krakow. So, with the Mona Lisa in her upstairs confinement, \u201cLa Belle Ferronni\u00e8re\u201d is left to be the show\u2019s singular star.\n\nGod, she is beautiful. Emerging like a weirdly solid specter from behind a stone parapet, her stillness is accentuated by the way her arms hang decorously down at her side, by the sharp clarity of her costume and by Leonardo\u2019s subtle idealizing of her features.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Leonardo\u2019s signature obsession was movement. And in \u201cLa Belle Ferronni\u00e8re,\u201d despite her physical stillness, this feeling for flux, though subtle, is on full display. Her face is animated not only by the fluttering play of shadow but by the movement of her eyes. Because she is turning to her left, one eye is slightly closer and therefore larger. And as her pupils turn into the shadowy sfumato at the corners of their almond-shaped apertures, Leonardo exposes the whites. The larger of the two is tinged pink. With a slightly queasy shock, you register its full roundedness as it turns in its socket.\n\nThe greatness of Leonardo\u2019s portraits of women can\u2019t, finally, be explained away. There is something more enigmatic going on. Pater wrote that his women \u201cseem to be subject to exceptional conditions, to feel powers at work in the common air unfelt by others,\u201d powers they passed on to us \u201cin a chain of secret influences.\u201d\n\nPater may have been a creature of 19th century spiritualism and aestheticism, his sensibility as alien to the Renaissance as to our own era of metrics and algorithms. But I like his take on Leonardo because it grapples openly with an idea that was of fundamental importance to the artist himself (an idea that warrants reviving today): that there are chains of hidden influence and a secret rapport between all things, living and dead.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci Through Feb 24 at the Louvre Museum, Paris. louvre.fr/en.\n\nAD", "description": "Why the art show that everyone is talking about cries out for a bit of silence.", "authors": ["Sebastian Smee", "Art Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fehpK1CcIFQSSnKDpJhX1awWifM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GNUELOXZWYI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
