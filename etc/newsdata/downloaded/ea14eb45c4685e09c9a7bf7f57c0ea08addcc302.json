The utility warned that it could take several days to restore power.\n\nIt was the second precautionary shutoff this week. Power was cut to 24,000 customers in Butte, Nevada and Yuba counties on Monday evening, lasting into Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Southern California Edison on Tuesday cut power to fewer than 100 people but warned that it was considering shutoffs to more than 140,000 customers in seven counties, depending on weather.\n\nStrong winds, low humidity and warm temperatures were forecast in the state through Wednesday, and authorities issued an extreme fire danger warning for some areas, including the Northern California interior.\n\nSome of the most destructive blazes in the state in the past two years were started by PG&E power lines, including a November blaze that killed 86 people and virtually leveled the Butte County town of Paradise.\n\nIn January, PG&E sought bankruptcy protection, saying it could not afford an estimated $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits stemming from catastrophic wildfires.\n\nEarlier this month, PG&E agreed to pay $11 billion to insurance companies holding 85% of the claims from fires that include the Paradise blaze.\n\nThe settlement, confirmed Monday, is subject to bankruptcy court approval.\n\nIt's important for PG&E to pull itself from bankruptcy protection because it will be a big part of a wildfire fund set up to help California's major utilities pay future claims as climate change makes wildfires more frequent and severe.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
