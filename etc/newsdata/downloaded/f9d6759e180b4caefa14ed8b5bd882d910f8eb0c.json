The region at risk happens to include Craig Shirley, a presidential historian and veteran public-relations adviser living in Essex County, who immediately launched an opinion poll on behalf of Citizens for Responsible Solar, a local grassroots group.\n\nThe survey revealed fierce local opposition to the giant solar complex. Op-eds and radio interviews followed, as did a public petition, press releases, letters to newspapers and much social media. The local folks emerged as the victors, the farmland and battlefields were saved, as was the Rapidan River.\n\nMr. Shirley and his team also recruited acclaimed film director Ron Maxwell \u2014 think \u201cGettysburg\u201d and \u201cGods and Generals\u201d \u2014 to advocate for preserving the beloved and sacred ground.\n\n\u201cThe history we share in Virginia is at risk. We are in danger of erasing the history that attracted many of us to call Virginia home,\u201d Mr. Maxwell noted in a letter to local officials.\n\nThe take-away: Canny public-affairs outreach and D.C.-style tactics work just as well across the rolling green countryside as it does in the hair-raising environment of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cWhen fertile and historically significant land is threatened, the amplified and unified voice of the people must be heard,\u201d declares Kevin McVicker, vice president of Shirley & Banister Public Affairs, which ultimately coordinated the efforts.\n\nWHO\u2019S IN CHARGE HERE?\n\nWho\u2019s really running things in the nation\u2019s capital? Is it President Trump, political insiders, Democrats, Republicans? The reality: One-third of Americans do not know who sets the \u201cagenda\u201d in Washington, this according to a new Economist/YouGov poll.\n\nThat includes 26% of Republicans, 44% of independents and 27% of Democrats.\n\nThe percentage rises to 40% among millennials and 39% among both black people and women.\n\nSome relief for Mr. Trump\u2019s fans, though. Among eight choices of powerful D.C. entities in the survey, Mr. Trump is considered to be in charge of the agenda by the largest percentage of respondents. See the numbers in the Poll du Jour at column\u2019s end. Then ask yourself: Who\u2019s in charge here?\n\nFAKE FOX FIGHT?\n\nThere has been a skirmish between President Trump and Fox News in recent weeks, to the delight of the hostile news media. Some say, however, that it is a \u201cfake feud\u201d similar to what is found brewing between pro wrestling rivals who stay in character and appear to be in a real fight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that Trump is once again laying the groundwork to start his own, Foxier than Fox TV channel or conservative news website. But it\u2019s far likelier that this is all make-believe,\u201d writes Jack Shafer, senior media analyst for Politico.\n\nThere is a motive behind it all, he says.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s faux-fight with Fox is designed 1) to add drama and excitement to where there is none; 2) make him the primary focus of events; and 3) temporarily complicate the storyline so viewers keep watching. Fox benefits from Trump\u2019s periodic attacks (remember when he boycotted one of Fox\u2019s 2016 presidential debates because it wouldn\u2019t dump Megyn Kelly from the broadcast). They make the channel look like it\u2019s standing up to the president, and Fox ends up looking more independent and credible,\u201d Mr. Shafer reasons.\n\nMEANWHILE IN FLORIDA\n\nRepublican and Democratic strategists eye one another constantly, searching for political minutiae which could benefit their respective causes. Case in point: NRCC vs. DCCC \u2014 the rivalry between the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Today\u2019s topic: pushback in Florida over the reelection campaign of state Rep. Margaret Good, a Democrat.\n\n\u201cThe DCCC is officially meddling in the Florida-16 primary, throwing their support behind Margaret Good. Talk about a kiss of death. Good will now be forced to own the Washington Democrats\u2019 entire socialist agenda which includes eliminating employer-based health insurance for government run health care \u2014 all in a district President Trump won by over 10 points,\u201d the GOP organization notes in an analysis.\n\nYes, well. This scenario could be repeated elsewhere.\n\n\u201cNow that Margaret Good has the backing of the Washington political machine, there will be no way for her to run away from their extreme socialist agenda in a district President Trump won by double digits,\u201d advises Camille Gallo, spokeswoman for the NRCC.\n\nHERE COMES THE ALMANAC\n\nThe annual arrival of the bodacious Almanac of American Politics is such a big deal in certain circles that it warrants a fancy launch party with the publication\u2019s high-profile authors, who include Charlie Cook, Michael Barone and Rich Cohen.\n\nThe almanac remains \u201cthe gold standard of accessible political information\u201d and includes profiles of every governor and lawmaker, campaign finance data, analysis of voter turnout and registration data. Among many, many things.
