According to the Jackson estate, Leaving Neverland violated a non-disparagement agreement from 1992, when the network aired Jackson\u2019s Dangerous tour doc. HBO argued the 26-year-old contract was no longer applicable. They moved to dismiss the case under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute, which discourages frivolous lawsuits designed to chill free speech on public issues. \u201cIt was filed to chill speech,\u201d HBO attorney Theodore Boutrous argued in court, as reported by Variety. \u201cIt was filed to tell the world, \u2018Don\u2019t talk about child sex abuse.\u2019\u2026 A company like HBO may be able to fight back and move forward. Others might not be able to do that.\u201d For now, Judge Wu has ruled that since the suit asks to go into arbitration, the anti-SLAPP statute doesn\u2019t apply. His final ruling is expected by month\u2019s end. He acknowledges that whatever he decides will most likely be appealed: \u201cYou\u2019re a big company, they\u2019re a wealthy estate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clash of the titans.\u201d", "description": "A Judge has Tentatively Sided with the Michael Jackson Estate in its lawsuit against HBO.
