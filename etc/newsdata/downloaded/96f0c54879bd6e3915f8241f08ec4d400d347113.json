For seven months he lied to us,\" the first woman insisted.\n\nThe ad blitz did not go as planned.\n\n\"What turned out and what I didn't know would happen and I'm not sure anybody did, was that the impeachment move by the Republicans backfired,\" said Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume in the Fox Nation show.\n\nOn election night, Democrats picked up five House seats and the balance of power in the Senate remained unchanged.\n\nHume continued, \"Times were good. You know Clinton had done the things that got him re-elected and they were still in place and the economy was doing as well as ever. And this story did not offend the country the way we all -- more or less -- assumed it would. It just didn't.\"\n\nJUDGE NAPOLITANO RECALLS CLINTON IMPEACHMENT, WARNS AMERICANS TO BRACE FOR TURBULENT TIMES\n\nFox News contributor Mara Liasson added, \"Bill Clinton's presidency was a period of peace and prosperity. That's the bottom line for presidents... You could draw a comparison between Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, people understand their faults, they like them anyway.\"\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham R-Sc., also reflected on those turbulent times, saying that he believes the Republicans were seen as overreaching and the American people were not behind them.\n\n\"People saw us as a majority that kind of got out of control. Impeachment is a political exercise as much as it is a legal exercise, and it changed the standing of the Republican majority,\" said Graham.\n\nA new poll from Quinnipiac University, which was conducted in the days leading up to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement of an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, found that 37% of the public supports the impeachment and removal of the president, while 57% oppose it.\n\nTo see all of the \"Scandalous: The Clintons,\" visit Fox Nation and join today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.
