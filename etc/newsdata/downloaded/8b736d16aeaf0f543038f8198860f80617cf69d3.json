Everyone saw on the pitch when he landed that it wasn't a good situation.\"\n\nHe added: \"Of course it affected the game. We cannot take the credit from Brighton, but the team suffered a massive impact from that action.\n\n\"We tried to find a different way to play in the second half and we didn't have much luck.\n\n\"At 3-0 you could see the game was over. I want to say sorry to the fans and thank them for their massive effort.\"\n\nTottenham, still seemingly scarred by the result in midweek, offered little resistance after falling behind as they limped to a first defeat to Brighton in 36 years.\n\nIrish forward Connolly was particularly impressive, marking his maiden Premier League start with two well-taken goals either side of half-time.\n\nStory continues\n\nGraham Potter praised the 19-year-old as he celebrated a pressure-relieving first victory since the opening weekend of the season.\n\n\"He's been knocking on the door,\" Potter told BT Sport when asked about Connolly.\n\n\"He's had some substitute appearances and been unlucky not to score. He gives us an extra dimension. I'm delighted for him.\n\n\"He's a young lad with a big future and we're delighted we've got him with us.\"", "description": "Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino gave an update on Hugo Lloris and apologised to the club's fans following Saturday's loss.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Yh2v80efsuZoSWFY5wwXLQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L.OjHGnrJos4SvDdQTFTUQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/68ea2be65dbefac5361fc311971df423", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
