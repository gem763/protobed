They don\u2019t get too many credits, but they should get credit for driving tier-two development. It\u2019s great for the game.\u201d\n\nA complaint often levelled at the sport\u2019s powerhouses is that they do not play their less established rivals frequently enough.\n\n\u201cWorld rugby is like having a little brother \u2013 they always want more. There\u2019s always only so much you can do, but just look at how competitive they\u2019ve been at the World Cup,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had better preparation and there\u2019s more organisation put into their structure.\n\n\u201cTheir players are better prepared physically and there are young players coming through. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s certainly moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s players have been given the weekend off to spend time with family before heading to Tokyo on Sunday to begin preparations for the clash with Argentina.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll review the game against the USA and look at the 23 we need to play against Argentina,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll consider the conditions because Tokyo will be 27 degrees and 80 per cent humidity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a wet-weather game, so we\u2019ll pick a side to play wet-weather rugby. The sun might be shining but it will be wet weather.\n\n\u201cThis World Cup is unique because of the conditions \u2013 it\u2019s never been played in these conditions before.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Eddie Jones has signalled a ceasefire in his feud with World Rugby after praising its success in raising the standards of tier-two nations competing at the World Cup.
