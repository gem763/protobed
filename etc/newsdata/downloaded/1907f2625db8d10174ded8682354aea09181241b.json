Stefan Crichton (1-0) pitched the ninth for his first major league win.\n\nMatt Strahm (6-11) gave up three hits and the decisive run for the loss.\n\nWalker, reinstated from the 60-day injured list earlier Sunday, made his first start for the Diamondbacks since April 14, 2018 and pitched a scoreless inning. He missed almost two full seasons after Tommy John surgery.\n\nAfter striking out the Padres\u2019 Eric Hosmer to end the first, he walked back into the dugout to embraces from every teammate.\n\nThe Padres\u2019 Manny Machado, who signed a 10-year, $300 million contract before the season, was 2 for 4 including a hustle double to left-center in the ninth inning. He finished the season with a .256 batting average, the lowest in his career, and 150 hits, also a career low for a full season.\n\nThe Diamondbacks finished 85-77, a three-game improvement from 2018 and good for second place in the NL West. The Padres (70-92) ended on a six-game losing streak after firing manager Andy Green. They made a four-game improvement from last season\u2019s 66-96 record.\n\nThe Padres loaded the bases with one out in the fifth against Alex Young, who relieved Walker. Young escaped and ended his outing with four scoreless innings.\n\nThe Diamondbacks had runners on first and third in the sixth after Urias\u2019 throwing error and Eduardo Escobar\u2019s single. Walker grounded into the double play to end the inning.\n\nBefore the bottom of the fifth inning, the Diamondbacks doffed their caps and applauded the crowd in appreciation of the fan support this season.\n\nMAKE IT ANOTHER 2-MIL\n\nThe Diamondbacks finished over the 2 million mark in total attendance at Chase Field for the 22nd straight season, the club\u2019s entire existence. With Sunday\u2019s crowd of 45,446, Arizona\u2019s final attendance count was 2,135,510 for the season, a decrease of more than 100,000 from last season.\n\nWORLD CUP WINNER\n\nJessica McDonald, a Phoenix area native and member of the U.S. Women\u2019s National soccer team that won this year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Diamondbacks outfielder Adam Jones caught it, wearing his USWNT jersey.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: Jones sat out Sunday after feeling hamstring tightness during Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Taijuan Walker returned from Tommy John surgery on the final day of the regular season, Tim Locastro beat out an infield grounder to drive home the winning run in the ninth inning and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the San Diego Padres 1-0 Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jose M.
