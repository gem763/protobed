And if her catering is anything to go by, it\u2019s a winner, writes Grethe Kemp.\n\nThe first time I tried Chef Nti\u2019s cooking was at a media event for Love Beets. The focus, of course, was beetroot and using the sometimes-overbearing ingredient must have been a challenge. But Nti pulled it off with ease, pushing out sumptuous salads, plush purple cakes and beautiful cordials to the hungry guests.\n\nThe beetroot was beautifully showcased, but at no point overpowering.\n\nNow Nti has graced us with her first cookbook. Called My Modern African Kitchen, it\u2019s among a host of cookbooks by black chefs who highlight traditional ingredients.\n\n\u201cIt is inspired by my life\u2019s story, where I grew up in Tladi, Soweto, with my mother, whom we call Mama D, and my grandmother,\u201d says Nti about the book.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s with this heritage of mine and our shared South African heritage that I would like to use this\u2018love letter\u2019 of mine to speak to a new generation by reinventing the flavours we grew up with in a fresh, innovative way \u2013 celebrating food that is proudly South African.\u201d\n\nA distinctive element in the book is an entire chapter dedicated to one of Africa\u2019s food staples \u2013 mealie meal.\n\n\u201cFrom the rural villages to urban townships, mealie meal porridge and pap complete the food experience of many families in our country,\u201d says Nti. \u201cI grew up in a small family in Soweto and we ate pap at least five times a week, like many families in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important for me to use this book to celebrate this part of our shared, diverse heritage and show you exciting modern twists you can play around with using traditional foodstuffs.\u201d\n\nNti shared these recipes with us:\n\nAmasi Cheesecake\n\nThis cheesecake looks so delicious, you don\u2019t have to convince anybody.\n\nIt\u2019s a must!\n\nIt\u2019s a recipe from Nti\u2019s live TV days \u2013 an unbaked cheesecake made with fermented milk and jelly.\n\nIngredients\n\n100g butter, plus extra for greasing\n\n225g (1 packet) Oreos or any chocolate biscuits of your choice\n\n1 packet strawberry jelly powder\n\n1 cup rich and creamy amasi (very cold)\n\nZest of 1 lemon\n\n1 cup fresh berries, sliced (optional, for decorating)\n\nServes: 8\n\nMethod\n\nGrease the inside of a springform cake tin with butter and line it with cling wrap.\n\nMelt the butter and crush the biscuits finely.\n\nMix the biscuits with the warm butter and spread this over the base of the cake tin.\n\nMix the jelly powder with a cup of hot water (or follow package instructions).\n\nWhip the amasi with lemon zest until smooth and add to the warm jelly liquid.\n\nPour the mixture over the crushed biscuit base.\n\nPut the cheesecake in the fridge to set, preferably overnight or for a few hours at least.\n\nRemove it 15 minutes before serving.\n\nDecorate with fresh seasonal berries, if you like.\n\nPhutu Tabbouleh\n\nThis Middle Eastern salad normally uses bulgur wheat. Nti likes to use everyday ingredients to make special meals, so for this recipe she substituted the bulgur wheat with uphuthu. Mealie meal is a staple in South Africa.\n\nTabbouleh is a vegetarian dish, but Nti always serves hers with a topping of fish or lean meat like ostrich. It\u2019s such a generous salad, and Nti uses it often when she\u2019s hosting.\n\nIngredients\n\n\u00bd cup boiling water\n\n1\u00bd cups mealie meal\n\n1 cucumber, unpeeled but\n\nseeded and finely chopped\n\n2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved\n\n\u00bc cup finely chopped spring onion\n\n\u00bd tsp ground cumin\n\n\u00bc tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley\n\n2 tbsp chopped mint\n\nJuice of 2 lemons\n\n4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n\nSalt and pepper\n\nLettuce for plating\n\n(Nti uses romaine)\n\nServes: 4\n\nMethod\n\nPour a little salt and the hot water into a pot with a thick base and bring to the boil. Add the mealie meal (don\u2019t stir) and close the lid.\n\nReduce heat and simmer gently for five minutes. Fluff with a fork during cooking until it\u2019s crumbly.\n\nSet aside to cool completely, then crumble using your hands for a super-fine texture.\n\nMix in the spring onion first, then add the cucumber, tomatoes, cumin, parsley, mint, lemon juice and oil, and season to taste.\n\nArrange a bed of lettuce on a serving platter and heap the tabbouleh on to it. Drizzle with more olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice, and serve.\n\nLemongrass Ginger Beer\n\nThis is the in-house drink at Taste Kitchen, and Nti\u2019s mum would always politely suggest that it be finished with pineapple as a garnish and for flavour.\n\nOf course, Nti ignored her. Oh, until she did try it with pineapple. Magic! Treat your own guests to some homemade goodness.\n\nIngredients\n\n4 litres water\n\n150g lemongrass, chopped\n\n250g ginger, chopped\n\n625g sugar\n\nJuice and zest of 2 lemons\n\n2 tsp yeast\n\n1 pineapple, cubed\n\nServes: 16\n\nMethod\n\nBring one litre of water to the boil in a large pot.\n\nAdd the lemongrass, ginger and sugar, and allow the sugar to dissolve.\n\nAdd the rest of the water, with the lemon juice, zest and yeast. Stir well. Leave to rest for 10 to 12 hours, then strain the ginger beer and refrigerate.\n\nAdd pineapple just before serving.\n\nIt can be served cold with ice, or slightly warm in winter. Add slices of fresh ginger at the end for another dimension.", "description": "Multitalented TV chef, emcee, fashionista and entrepreneur Nthabiseng Nti Ramaboa \u2013 AKA Chef Nti \u2013 has her first cookbook out.
