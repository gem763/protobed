REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nWhile dismissing some claims, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said users could try to hold Facebook liable under various federal and state laws for letting app developers and business partners harvest their personal data without their consent on a \u201cwidespread\u201d basis.\n\nHe rejected Facebook\u2019s arguments that users suffered no \u201ctangible\u201d harm and had no legitimate privacy interest in information they shared with friends on social media.\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s motion to dismiss is littered with assumptions about the degree to which social media users can reasonably expect their personal information and communications to remain private,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cFacebook\u2019s view is so wrong.\u201d\n\nNeither Facebook nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nLesley Weaver and Derek Loeser, two of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, said in a joint statement that they were pleased with the decision, and \u201cespecially gratified that the court is respecting Facebook users\u2019 right to privacy.\u201d\n\nThe litigation followed a series of data privacy issues involving Menlo Park, California-based Facebook.\n\nThese included the 2015 breach that allowed Cambridge Analytics, a British political consulting firm, to access data for an estimated 87 million Facebook users. That breach was not revealed until March 2018.\n\nIn their 414-page complaint, users said Facebook misled them into thinking they could keep control over personal data, when in fact it let thousands of \u201cpreferred\u201d outsiders such as Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix gain access.\n\nChhabria faulted Facebook for treating privacy as an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d proposition, where users would forfeit their privacy by sharing data even in a \u201climited\u201d fashion.\n\nHe said Facebook had taken different positions elsewhere, including in a California case where it likened information kept on social media accounts to information stored on smartphones, where privacy concerns might be greater.\n\nThat position is \u201ccloser to the truth than the company\u2019s assertions in this case,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cSharing information with your social media friends does not categorically eliminate your privacy interest in that information.\u201d\n\nThe litigation covers Facebook users in the United States and United Kingdom whose information was shared with third parties without their consent since 2007.\n\nThe case is In re Facebook Inc Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-md-02843.", "description": "A federal judge on Monday ordered Facebook Inc to face most of a nationwide lawsuit seeking damages for letting third parties such as Cambridge Analytica access users' private data, calling the social media company's views on privacy \"so wrong.\"", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428102552&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881WZ", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
