China\u2019s proposal for major infrastructure building in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as part of its Belt and Road programme has faced strong Indian opposition.\n\nChina is in turn sensitive to India letting the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama keep his base in northern India.\n\nBut most of the disagreements were pushed to one side so they did not become a summit dispute.\n\nKashmir was not raised in the two days of talks, Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said.\n\nThey did however agree to step up their efforts so \u201cthat the international community strengthens the framework against training, financing and supporting terrorist groups throughout the world,\u201d said the Indian statement.\n\nModern rivalry between the world\u2019s two most populous countries dates back decades.\n\nThey went to war in 1962 over disputed Himalayan territory and other border standoffs remain. In 2017, the Indian and Chinese armies faced each other down for more than two months on a high altitude border plateau claimed by China and India\u2019s tiny Himalayan ally Bhutan.\n\nModi and Xi \u201creiterated their understanding that efforts will continue to be made to ensure peace and tranquility in the border areas, and that both sides will continue to work on additional confidence building measures,\u201d said the Indian statement.\n\nOn commerce, India and China are both facing a protectionist US and want greater access to each other\u2019s markets. India in particular is concerned by China\u2019s $57 billion surplus in their joint trade.\n\nIndia\u2019s summit statement said high level talks would start on ways to \u201cbetter balance\u201d trade between the countries. Modi and Xi also agreed to \u201cencourage\u201d more cross-border investment.\n\nNo mention was made however of China\u2019s campaign for New Delhi to give Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a key part of India\u2019s transformation to 5G communications.\n\nThe United States has been lobbying strongly against letting Huawei spread its influence because of its alleged close links to the Beijing government.\n\nChina made no immediate comment on the summit. The official Xinhua news agency said Xi received a \u201cwarm welcome\u201d from Modi and they agreed their countries \u201cshould respect and learn from each other so as to jointly achieve common development and prosperity.\u201d\n\nXi flew off to Nepal for a one-day stopover on his way home in a country that India has traditionally considered within its sphere of influence. China is pressing for a greater share of Nepal\u2019s infrastructure projects.\n\nNepalese authorities detained at least 18 Tibetan activists in a bid to head off protests during the visit, the International Campaign for Tibet said.", "description": "MAHABALIPURAM (India) (AFP) \u2013 India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Saturday for a \u201cnew era\u201d in relations with China as he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/29a97f_india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-told-chinese-president-xi-jinping-summit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
