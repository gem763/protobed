He Just Done Wrong\u201d", "language": "en", "text": "Click here to read the full article.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that as the reports surfaced that President Donald Trump had asked the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, it was a clarifying moment that convinced her to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell if he knows right from wrong. He just done wrong,\u201d Pelosi said of Trump\u2019s July 17 call, which is now at the center of the Democratic-led investigation.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nPelosi announced the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, but speaking at the New Yorker Festival, moderator Jane Mayer asked her what led her to favor launching the impeachment process after earlier opposing it.\n\n\u201cThere was plenty the president had done, evidenced in the Mueller report, that were impeachable offenses,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nNoting that \u201ctiming is everything,\u201d she said that the Ukraine scandal gave a moment of \u201cclarity\u201d: An easier to understand example of how Trump may have abused his power.\n\n\u201cThis had a story. This had clarity,\u201d she said of her decision.\n\nPelosi spoke to by phone Trump earlier in the day on Sept. 24. At first, the president wanted to talk about gun violence measures and background checks, but he switched the subject to the story that was dominating the news cycle \u2014 the July 17 phone call he had with Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump told her the call was \u201cperfect,\u201d Pelosi said, but she told him, \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nShe said that Trump insisted that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d but didn\u2019t seem to get that asking a foreign leader to investigate a potential political opponent was problematic.\n\n\u201cHis insistence that it was so \u2018right\u2019 made it imperative that we proceed,\u201d she said.\n\nPelosi did not say whether they would hold a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry, not just the impeachment itself, as some Republicans have said is needed to make the investigation legitimate.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in the Constitution that says we have to take that vote,\u201d she said, although she did not rule it out. \u201cWhen the time is right\u2026we may take it.\u201d\n\nShe emphasized that even though they are conducting an impeachment inquiry, they have not yet decided to \u201cgo down that path\u201d of impeachment itself.\n\n\u201cThis has to be done strategically, fairly, prayerfully, solemnly,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also cautioned Democrats not to \u201cgloat\u201d during the process.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sad time, when the truth and the facts and the data show that the President has violated his oath of office.\u201d\n\nPelosi tried to talk about other issues during the 90-minute session, including Democrats legislative efforts on issues like lowering the cost of prescription drugs and gun reform legislation, but it is all but inevitable that the media focus for the foreseeable future will be on Trump and impeachment.\n\nShe said that the Trump\u2019s ability to dominate a news cycle \u2014- even with an outrageous tweets sent at 3 a.m. \u2014- may be enabled by the media and come at the expense of coverage of other issues.\n\n\u201cThe press is the guardian of our democracy,\u201d but Trump is a \u201cmaster of diversion,\u201d she said. She said that he\u2019s shown he can get attention for \u201cthe next 24 hours\u201d and then \u201cwe don\u2019t hear what else is going on.\u201d\n\nThose tweets have included biting nicknames that Trump has given to rivals and opponents. Mayer asked Pelosi about some of Trump\u2019s nicknames for her. In contrast to those he has given to other figures, the ones he has directed at Pelosi have been relatively soft.\n\n\u201cEverything he says is a projection of himself,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWhen he says, \u2018nervous Nancy,\u2019 it means he is nervous himself.\u201d\n\nPelosi did reveal that she recently got a meme from Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead.\n\nIt read: \u201cDonald, you own a casino. You know the House always wins.\u201d\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
