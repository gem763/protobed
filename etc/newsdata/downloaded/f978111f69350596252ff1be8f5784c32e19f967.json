News out late Sunday provides the answer.\n\nAn unconfirmed report by the Financial Times said that Flint\u2019s replacement, Noel Quinn, is preparing to cut another 10,000 jobs from the lender. Given that Quinn is only in the position on an interim basis, that\u2019s a powerful statement.\n\nIt also adds substance to the narrative around Flint\u2019s departure \u2013 the board was too polite to spell it out explicitly at the time \u2013 namely, that the HSBC lifer was too tender-hearted to make the sort of cuts that the board felt were necessary to shore up profits.\n\nThe FT\u2019s report indicates where those cuts might be felt. The bank\u2019s global retail operations are set to bear the brunt, especially in the euro zone, where sub-zero interest rates have crushed profitability. With many expecting more aggressive quantitative easing and even lower interest rates from the European Central Bank when Christine Lagarde takes over next month, the logic of hanging on and waiting for things to get better has worn thin. HSBC\u2019s network in France is reported to be under particular scrutiny.\n\nHSBC is far from alone in facing an unmanageable two-way squeeze of costs and revenues \u2013 the infamous \u2018Jaws\u2019 that Flint and his cohorts have had to talk about in recent years. Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) unveiled 18,000 job cuts earlier this year in a major strategic rethink, the big difference being that its problems were most acute in the U.S., the one major developed market where banking is still reasonably profitable. Societe Generale (PA:SOGN) and Barclays (LON:BARC) have also been trying hard to prune staff.\n\nHSBC hopes that the cuts will create some space for it to hire more people in Asia, where the opportunities are greater. However, 10,000 is still barely 4% of the bank\u2019s workforce. Given the long-term pressure on profits (the home market of the U.K. is also edging closer to cutting interest rates, increasing the squeeze on what is already a mortgage-heavy, low-margin franchise), it would be a surprise if Quinn\u2019s successor, whoever he or she may be, turns out to have plenty of work still to do.\n\nDeutsche has yet to reap much reward from its boldness (the external circumstances having moved against it in the meantime), but HSBC outperformed its peers slightly on Monday in an otherwise directionless market. The shares were down 0.4% by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), while the FTSE 100 was down less than 0.1%. The broader Stoxx 600 index was effectively unchanged. Germany\u2019s DAX was down 0.1% after another decline \u2013 albeit a gentler one \u2013 in factory orders in August.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSoftBank-backed Oyo to raise $1.5 billion led by founder, other existing investors\n\nGlobal stocks hover as weak European data, trade anxiety offsets U.S. jobs boost\n\nExclusive: IKEA to face EU order to pay Dutch back taxes - sources", "description": "By Geoffrey Smith", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
