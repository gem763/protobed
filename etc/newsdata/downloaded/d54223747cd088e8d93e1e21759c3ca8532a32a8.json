Scientists believe that birds, which use agricultural environments as habitats or foraging stopovers during migration, are routinely exposed to these pesticides.\n\n\u201cWe saw these effects using doses well within the range of what a bird could realistically consume in the wild \u2013 equivalent to eating just a few treated seeds,\u201d said Margaret Eng, a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Saskatchewan Toxicology Centre and lead author on the study which looked at white-crowned sparrows who consumed small doses of imidacloprid.\n\nIn the experiment, researchers exposed individual sparrows to small doses of the pesticide in southern Ontario during a stopover on their spring migration.\n\nEach bird\u2019s body was measured before and after exposure. A lightweight radio transmitter was attached to the bird\u2019s back.\n\nThey found birds given a higher dose of the pesticide lost 6 per cent of their body mass within just six hours. One dose caused birds to stay 3.5 days longer at the stopover site before resuming their migration, scientists found.\n\n\u201cBoth of these results seem to be associated with the appetite suppression effect of imidacloprid. The dosed birds ate less food, and it\u2019s likely that they delayed their flight because they needed more time to recover and regain their fuel stores,\u201d said Dr Eng.\n\nIn North America, three-quarters of bird species rely on agricultural land that has significantly declined since 1966. This study shows pesticides could be directly contributing to catastrophic declines in birds.\n\n\u201cMigration is a critical period for birds, and timing matters. Any delays can seriously hinder their success in finding mates and nesting, so this may help explain, in part, why migrant and farmland bird species are declining so dramatically worldwide,\u201d said study author Christy Morrissey, an ecotoxicologist from the University of Saskatchewan.", "description": "Songbirds\u00a0exposed to the world\u2019s most widely used insecticide\u00a0exhibit \u201canorexic behaviour\u201d and delay\u00a0their migration because they needed more time to feed, according to new research.\u00a0 This is likely to severely harm their chances of surviving and reproducing, scientists said, adding that\u00a0imidacloprid\u00a0could be driving dramatic declines in global songbird populations.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/14/istock-173946954.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
