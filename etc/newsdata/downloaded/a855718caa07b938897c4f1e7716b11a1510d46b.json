That would add a stake of at least 20.5% to the 49.99% it already controls.\n\nHowever, the deal faces challenges. Russian regulators have so far capped Fortum's ownership in Uniper at 49.99% due to a strategic water licence operated by the German firm's local subsidiary Unipro.\n\nThe Finnish company needs the help of Uniper's management to try to address that issue.\n\nState-controlled Fortum has been seeking control of the energy firm since 2017, but Uniper's management had opposed a full takeover, warning it could result in a break-up and threaten the firm's credit rating.
