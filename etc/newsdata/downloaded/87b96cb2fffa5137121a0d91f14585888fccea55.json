This is what [Joseph] Stalin dreamt about but never achieved. You are on the frontlines of the war against communism coming back to America under the guise of Democratic socialism,\u201d he told his audience.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhile the Soviet Union was indeed opposed to the vulgar excesses of materialistic US consumer-capitalism during the Cold War, Mr Gorka linking Ms Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow \u201cblue wave\u201d idealists to the Russian dictator\u2019s reign of terror is as obvious a piece of scaremongering as it is hysterical and disingenuous.\n\nHe is also incorrect in singling out the humble hamburger as an emblem of Bolshevik disapproval. At one time, the regime positively envied the all-American lunch option and considered it a model meal: simple, affordable and nutritious.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Gene Russell / United States Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nAnastas Mikoyan, a long-serving Minister of Foreign Trade, visited the US on a diplomatic mission in 1936 where he observed the American economic system at close quarters, studying its food industry, meeting with auto tycoon Henry Ford and visiting Macy\u2019s department store in New York City with a view to improving efficiency at home.\n\nMikoyan - recently portrayed on screen by Paul Whitehouse in Armando Ianucci\u2019s satire The Death of Stalin (2017) \u2013 had already introduced canning to modernise Soviet food plants, his efforts hailed (or satirised, depending on your point-of-view) in Boris Pilnyak\u2019s socialist-realist novel Meat (1936), a Soviet answer to The Jungle (1907) by Upton Sinclair.\n\nHe returned from his trip with a number of souvenirs of American goods he felt had virtue and should be introduced at home. His haul included ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice and hamburgers.\n\n\u201cYou, Anastas, care more about ice cream, than about communism,\u201d Stalin joked when Mikoyan encouraged the manufacture of the dessert in the USSR.\n\nThe food commissar would commission The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food in 1939, a state cookbook intended to encourage homecooking and quell interest in restaurant dining and its associated service culture. It was read by one-sixth of the world\u2019s population at the time.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Kremlin, of course, preferred gourmet sausages.\n\nThe New York Times wrote about the dish in a profile of Mikoyan, \u201cthe man who introduced Eskimo Pie to the Soviet Union\u201d, in November 1964: \u201cThe \u2018Mikoyan cutlet\u2019 \u2013 nobody knows whether it is pork or beef or perhaps fish or fowl \u2013 is still the cheapest, most popular if not most revered piece of meat a few kopecks can buy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Mikoyan generally, the Times said: \u201cIf he had emigrated to the United States he would now be a multi\u2010millionaire with a Park Avenue penthouse.\u201d\n\nToday, the biggest McDonald\u2019s in Europe stands in Pushkin Square in Moscow, the fast-food chain being one of the first American businesses to enter the new Russian Federation when it opened on 31 January 1990 in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nGiven that President Trump is such a fan of McDonald\u2019s \u2013 appearing in an advert alongside its mascot Grimace in 2002, devouring Big Macs on Air Force One and serving 300 \u201chamberders\u201d to the Clemson Tigers at the White House during the recent shutdown \u2013 Republicans can surely rest easy about any threat to their lunches from malevolent outside forces.
