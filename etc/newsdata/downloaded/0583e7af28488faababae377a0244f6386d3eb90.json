It is poverty.\n\nDecades after the end of legalized segregation, and the funding disparities that accompanied it, minority students remain disproportionately concentrated in high-poverty areas. Academically, they trail students in more affluent areas, and they fall increasingly behind as the years pass. The result is an achievement gap that limits the educational and career opportunities of nonwhite children.\n\nBut the gap narrows, according to the research, when school districts are integrated, exposing poor minority students to the same opportunities as their richer peers.\n\nSeparate, Not Equal School districts with bigger gaps in poverty rates between white and black students\u2019 schools also show bigger gaps between their test scores. U.S. school districts by poverty and test-score gaps In Washington, D.C., black students attend schools with 55% higher poverty rates than white students and score an average of 5.1 grades lower on achievement tests. +6 grade levels +5 +4 Test score gap +3 +2 +1 0 No gap \u20131 No gap \u20132 \u201325% 0 25 50 75 poverty Gap\n\nThe findings represent the work of researchers at Stanford, Penn State and St. John\u2019s universities. To arrive at their conclusions, the researchers examined eight years of standardized test scores for grades three through eight for all public school districts in the U.S.\u2014a total of 350 million scores.\n\nAn accompanying website maps learning rates, test scores and trend data across every public school district in the U.S., allowing policy makers, educators and others to explore the data.\n\nAmong other things, the study suggests the goal of creating first-rate schools in every neighborhood regardless of race or socioeconomic composition\u2014an approach that supplanted busing efforts\u2014hasn\u2019t worked.\n\n\u201cIf it were possible to create equal educational opportunity under conditions of segregation and economic inequality, some community\u2014among the thousands of districts in the country\u2014would have done so,\u201d the researchers write in their paper. \u201cNone have. Separate is still unequal.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion is noteworthy because desegregation efforts of the past are being slowly reversed as dozens of wealthy white enclaves secede from larger, more diverse and less affluent school districts to form their own systems.\n\nTypically, the result is greater racial and socioeconomic segregation. The majority of districts left behind after secessions have a higher number of nonwhite students and students living in poverty than the newly formed districts, and the trend appears to be accelerating, according to EdBuild, a New-Jersey based nonprofit that advocates for equitable school funding.\n\nSince 2000, at least 128 communities in the U.S. have attempted to secede from their school districts, EdBuild has documented. Of that number, 73 have succeeded, and 17 more are pending.\n\nThe numbers, as a portion of all school districts, are small. In total, roughly 13,200 school districts serve grades three through eight in the U.S. But the trend is widespread. Secessions, or attempted secessions, have occurred in every region of the country, from California to Maine.\n\nEdBuild notes that there are often legitimate reasons to reorganize school districts, such as shifting enrollment, but cautions that decisions to do so might intensify socioeconomic and racial divides. Of the 30 states that have explicit secession policies, only nine require a study of the funding impact of a proposed split, and only six require consideration of the effects on racial and socioeconomic diversity.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What benefits or drawbacks do you see from integrating school districts? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe problem is that when affluent communities secede, they don\u2019t merely remove their children from a larger school district. They strip that district of their wealth and influence, and perhaps even school facilities that fall within new boundaries.\n\nWhen Gardendale, Ala., tried to secede from the Jefferson County school district\u2014a move that was blocked last year\u2014the community planned to take over a new $46 million high school that had been funded by a special school-construction tax paid by all county residents.\n\nNearly half of all education funding comes from local sources found within a school district\u2019s boundaries. That includes property taxes, so when communities with higher property values leave less affluent areas, they take a disproportionate amount of funding with them.\n\nIn an extreme example, EdBuild found that in 2014, six largely white and wealthy Tennessee suburbs all broke off from the Shelby County school district, where Memphis is located. Afterward, the new districts had an average student poverty rate of 11%. The rate for what remained of the county district was triple that.\n\nAccording to the Stanford study, the results of such disparities show up in test scores.\n\nOn average, white students score 1.5 to two grade levels higher than black students, and in the nation\u2019s most segregated districts, the gaps are much larger. Nearly five grade levels separate black and white children in Atlanta and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe findings are part of a body of work suggesting that success depends less on who you are than on where you are\u2014a concept Mark Twain described in his 1881 novel \u201cThe Prince and the Pauper\u201d and Hollywood adapted a century later in the movie \u201cTrading Places.\u201d In each tale, a poor person plucked from a life of hardship thrives after landing in the lap of luxury.\n\nHarvard economists Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren have found real-life parallels to those fictional accounts.\n\nIn a paper published last year, they examined seven million families who moved across commuting zones and counties in the U.S. and found that relocating to a better area increased a child\u2019s expected income by 4% for each year lived in the new neighborhood. Moving to a worse community decreased the child\u2019s expected income by the same percentage. And the rates of marriage, teenage birth and college attendance followed similar patterns.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an argument that people want more neighborhood schools,\u201d said Sean Reardon, the lead author of the Stanford study. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you? It makes lots of sense.\u201d\n\nUnless, he said, having a neighborhood school means systematically assigning low-income students to lower-quality schools.\n\nWrite to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com", "description": "Educational disparities among minority students are largely driven by their concentration in high-poverty areas, a new study finds.", "authors": ["Jo Craven Mcginty", "Jo.Mcginty Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-113166/social", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
