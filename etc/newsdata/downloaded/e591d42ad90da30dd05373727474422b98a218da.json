'You approached Josh Hanson who was standing with his girlfriend and you slashed him using a razor sharp Stanley knife from his left ear across his neck causing a wound 37cm long that gaped to about 85cm wide. 'You had asked him what was his problem. The wound caused bleeding to his neck, you cut his windpipe and as a result he died as blood entered his airways. 'He died in effect from drowning in his own blood. You walked away and left Josh Hanson to die in front of his shocked and traumatised friends. 'Josh Hanson did not know you, he had done nothing to provoke any reaction form you let alone violence of this sort. 'Your account that he had threatened you with looks and gestures was, even if true, incapable of amounting to any justification for the way you acted. 'Your assertion that the injuries were caused by accident was rejected by the jury. [Josh Hanson] had not seen you holding the knife in your hand, he can have had no idea what you were about to do. 'This was a grotesque, violent and totally unnecessary attack on an innocent man. The reason why you behaved such a way may never be explained. You however know why you did. 'It is clear from when you looked up at the CCTV camera you had formed the intention to stab Josh Hanson. 'Josh Hanson did not react to your question, you then raised your hand and cut him across his body in one downward, rapid and forceful action. 'Having injured Josh you walked calmly away folding the knife as you left. You showed no feeling for Josh Hanson or anyone else you left behind. You knew you had killed him. 'Thereafter you were looked after and supported, you were driven to Camber Sands by a friend. You bought new clothes and left the UK in a private aircraft. You stayed away from the UK using false identity documents til earlier this year. 'You lived life as a fugitive, funded and supported no doubt. 'You went to extreme lengths to alter your appearance disguising a tattoo of your children's names by a new tattoo of a skull and a bird when you were in the Czech Republic. 'Josh Hanson was a popular man, he loved life and was loved and he had his entire life ahead of him. He was generous and supportive, he excelled in his work the court has heard from people who loved Josh Hanson. 'They spoke of how they struggled with realisation that Josh was killed by you for no reason at all. His mother, sister and grandmother have spoken with great dignity in these difficult circumstances. 'Words cannot express the hurt and damage you have caused. You murdered Josh Hanson in front of people who were enjoying their night out. One witness, an off-duty nurse who had been dancing with friends went to help. 'This death was particularly unpleasant and distinguishes it from other deaths caused by knives. It amounts to a random attack on an otherwise pleasant evening. 'Josh Hanson stood up and was acting unusually in confusion because of he was injured. One witness was too traumatised to give evidence in person. 'You evaded the criminal justice system and... you prolonged their suffering. You remained at large and an international police manhunt was launched to try and find you.'\n\nShe received a call to say he had been stabbed in the early hours and was 10 minutes away when he died.\n\nShe told the court: 'He was taken from us in the most horrific way possible - suddenly, abruptly, viciously and violently.'\n\nMs Hanson said she had been unable to grieve for him without justice.\n\nBrooke Hanson said: 'Josh was not just my brother, he was my best friend.' She said his smile was 'infectious' and his presence 'magical'.\n\nShe told the court she suffered from anxiety and post-traumatic stress, always wondering if she could have protected him from the 'evil' that took him away.\n\nGrandmother Mary Hanson said in a statement read on her behalf that at the age of 80, she did not want to carry on when her grandson died.\n\nShe wrote: 'There is not a day when I don't think about my grandson. I cry for him every day, what he went through and how he suffered.'\n\nMr Hanson had only glanced at O'Brien and had not even spoken to him, but the killer claimed he was 'intimidated' when he saw the victim standing at the bar, talking to his his friends.\n\nHe approached Mr Hanson and slashed him from his ear to his chest before calmly leaving the club as the victim died by drowning in his own blood.\n\nThe next day he bought some designer clothes and a suitcase from Factory Store before flying to the Netherlands from Biggin Hill Airport in Kent.\n\nPolice later found the blood-stained Canada Goose jacket he wore when he killed Mr Hanson in a caravan at the Camber Sands Holiday Park.\n\nThey put up a \u00a350,000 reward for information leading to his arrest as O'Brien changed his appearance by growing a beard and getting a huge tattoo of a skull and an owl on his back to cover his daughter's name.\n\nHe used false identity documents to travel to countries including Germany, Belgium and the Czech Republic but was finally arrested in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in March this year and extradited to the UK after three and half years on the run.\n\nAn Old Bailey jury took just 55 minutes to unanimously convict O'Brien of murdering Mr Hanson after a two-week trial.\n\nO'Brien sat stony-faced in the dock and showed no emotion as he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 26 years.\n\nJudge Nigel Lickley, QC, sentencing, told the killer: 'On October 11, 2015 you murdered Josh Hanson at about 1am in the RE bar in Eastcote in front of people you knew those that knew Josh Hanson and others.\n\n'You approached Josh Hanson who was standing with his girlfriend and you slashed him using a razor sharp Stanley knife from his left ear across his neck causing a wound 37cm long that gaped to about 85cm wide.\n\n'You had asked him what was his problem.

The reason why you behaved such a way may never be explained.

You bought new clothes and left the UK in a private aircraft.\n\nAfter the stabbing in London, 1 on the map, O'Brien fled to Kent, 2, and flew to the Netherlands, 3, before visiting Germany, 4, Belgium, 5, and being arrested in the Czech Republic, 6. He then headed for Romania, 7, before being sent back to the UK\n\n'You stayed away from the UK using false identity documents til earlier this year. You lived life as a fugitive, funded and supported no doubt.\n\n'You went to extreme lengths to alter your appearance disguising a tattoo of your children's names by a new tattoo of a skull and a bird when you were in the Czech Republic.\n\n'Josh Hanson was a popular man, he loved life and was loved and he had his entire life ahead of him.\n\n'He was generous and supportive, he excelled in his work the court has heard from people who loved Josh Hanson.\n\nThe RE bar in Hillingdon, West London, is pictured in October 2015 after Mr Hanson's death\n\n'They spoke of how they struggled with realisation that Josh was killed by you for no reason at all.\n\n'His mother, sister and grandmother have spoken with great dignity in these difficult circumstances.\n\n'Words cannot express the hurt and damage you have caused.

'You evaded the criminal justice system and... you prolonged their suffering.\n\n'You remained at large and an international police manhunt was launched to try and find you.'\n\nThe public gallery was packed with 36 friends and family members of the victim, with one man screaming: 'F***ing kill yourself you f***ing little c**t, I'll smash your f***ing face in' as O'Brien was led away.\n\nThe victim's family released photos of Mr Hanson in his youth and before his tragic death\n\nMark Heywood, QC, prosecuting, said: 'Their paths crossed only briefly and for a period of seconds or a few minutes at most.\n\nMr Hanson (pictured) had glanced at O'Brien and had not even spoken to him, the court heard\n\n'As they spoke briefly, with others around them, the defendant reached for his blade and with a single, slashing downward motion, he used it. He quite simply cut the throat of the man he was facing.\n\n'The prosecution will describe it as an act of pitiless savagery.'\n\nO'Brien claimed his group went to the RE bar, after watching England play Uruguay in the Rugby World Cup and Mr Hanson immediately became hostile towards him.\n\n'From his posture I would describe him as raring to go, I felt he was ready to attack me. It kept getting worse and worse. It just seemed like something was going to happen.\n\n'He was smirking at me in a way what I would describe as, 'If only you knew what is about to happen to you.' That's what I would describe it as - looks, discreet aggressive conversations directed at us.\n\nMr Hanson's sister Brooke (left) and mother Tracey (right) outside the Old Bailey\n\n'Josh did not take his eyes off me. The whole time he's focused on me very aggressively.'\n\nO'Brien told how he took out a Stanley knife he bought that day to open cardboard boxes and claimed he only meant to scare Mr Hanson with it.\n\n'I approached him, in that split second it felt like it froze, that moment froze for a second when I made that action, I didn't mean to connect in any way, I meant to scare him off.'\n\nGraham Trembath, QC, defending O'Brien, said: 'It must be hard to imagine what on earth was going on in Shane O'Brien's head that night because there was no suggestion that he and Josh had ever met before.\n\nO'Brien grabbed the knife from the right pocket of his designer Canada Goose jacket before slashing Mr Hanson's throat, neck and chest in a single motion\n\n'To say the red mist came down is an understatement - it is simply incredible. But we do submit that it must be difficult to say there was an intent to kill.'\n\nO'Brien, of no fixed address, denied but was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 26 years.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh, from Scotland Yard, described the hunt for O'Brien as 'hugely challenging'.\n\nHe said: 'He was funded, provided with false documents, encrypted mobile phones, well beyond the capability of the ordinary criminal.'\n\n'This felt different from other murders': DCI Noel McHugh details the extraordinary globe-trotting three-year hunt to nail O'Brien\n\nDCI Noel McHugh, pictured at a separate murder scene, said his team had been determined to track down O'Brien\n\nThe detective who helped capture Britain's most wanted man, Shane O'Brien, today told the incredible inside story of how the Met tracked down the fugitive.\n\nDCI Noel McHugh said the four-year investigation has been 'heart-breaking, overwhelming and all-consuming' for his team of officers.\n\nHe said: 'The impact on Josh\u2019s mum Tracey and sister Brooke has been incomprehensible. But I am incredibly proud of what my team have achieved, working alongside Josh\u2019s family, and the extraordinary and outstanding work that has taken place to convict O\u2019Brien.'\n\nWriting of the start of the investigation, DCI McHugh said: 'Seizing CCTV from the bar was so crucial to our investigation we raced our engineer across London on blues and twos \u2013 we know attempts were being made to destroy it.\n\n'This fast response meant we could quickly prove O\u2019Brien\u2019s identity as the man we sought via fingerprint work on the cups he drank from that night.\n\n'At that stage we didn\u2019t know a great deal about him but, call it instinct if you like, somehow this felt different from other murders.'\n\nO'Brien's image was quickly publicised and detectives got the lead which took them to the Camber Sands caravan park where O'Brien had been hiding out.\n\nHe continued: 'There followed painstaking and time-consuming work to examine CCTV in and around the caravan park and try to work out if he was there, what car he had travelled in. We found a black VW Golf that fitted.\n\n'That enabled us to track its movements and then what O\u2019Brien did in the time following his attack on Josh.\n\n'What we saw was astounding; you would never know this man had just killed another in cold blood.\n\n'O\u2019Brien was seen casually enjoying a curry with a friend, posing in front of a mirror, even getting the left-overs in a bag to go and then spending a couple of hours at Ashford Designer Outlet.\n\n'You\u2019d think a man in his position might quickly grab the first thing on the shelf and make off, but no, as CCTV shows, he carefully selected and tried on trousers and shirts, even asking a shop assistant for help with collar sizing at one point. Always paying in cash \u2013 he was careful about that!'\n\nHe said police were just 12 hours behind him as he shopped at Ashford, but his 'connections and criminal links' allowed him to hire a plane to the continent.\n\nDCI McHugh: 'It was a theme throughout the investigation, O\u2019Brien\u2019s ability to travel on false documentation and undetected through countries, using private planes and highly encrypted phones costing \u00a33,000 apiece.\n\n'He had no job in the UK, no bank account; he spent his summers in Ibiza and had returned home just a couple of weeks before Josh\u2019s murder. Most of our manhunts last a few weeks or months, and the suspect might flee to another county in the UK, relying on family and limited funds \u2013 not O\u2019Brien.\n\n'The hunt was on and we followed up every single potential sighting, you just never knew. Some were frustratingly intended to distract and mislead the investigation, by tying up our resources to follow a line of enquiry that came to nothing.\n\n'But they were far outweighed by the many many well-intentioned calls and lots were very credible \u2013 Xmas 2017 we had news he was at a tanning shop in west London. It sounded unbelievable he could be so close to home but CCTV showed a man who looked very similar to O\u2019Brien. Extensive work would discount him.\n\n'As we know, in Prague his temper boiled up, leading to his arrest for a scuffle in a nightclub, a mistake on his part, or maybe not.\n\n'He was so confident and arrogant when arrested, it was clear this was no big deal for him. He was bailed \u2013 it was a low level offence \u2013 but fingerprints were taken and later proactive computer searches we requested revealed his true identity.\n\n'While frustrating we were so close, we had new images we could publicise and they showed a man who looked really fit and strong. He had boxing gloves on him when arrested and this gave us leads to follow up in local gyms plus we traced a barber who had cut O\u2019Brien\u2019s hair several times \u2013 O\u2019Brien said he was Australian but didn\u2019t have the accent to match.\n\n'We also found the tattooist he had visited to cover up his existing tattoos. We still hadn\u2019t got our hands on O\u2019Brien but it was progress and it was hope. Every little bit of information we obtained helped us build up a picture and was another piece of the puzzle towards finding him.\n\n'There were several arrests along the way. The man who chartered the plane and accompanied O\u2019Brien out of the UK was later convicted of importing 100kg of heroin and cocaine, along with 30 of those encrypted phones.\n\n'The pilots were convicted in the Netherlands of importing more than 90kg of heroin. O\u2019Brien had some interesting friends.'\n\nDCI McHugh continued: 'Late on Thursday 21 March this year I was called by O\u2019Brien\u2019s brief, based in the UK, saying O\u2019Brien was considering handing himself in and wanted me to travel to Budapest to personally meet him.\n\n'My immediate thought was why? - really, he could have walked into any police station and handed himself in as one of the world\u2019s most wanted men. Was this a trick to waste our time and resources getting out there only to find he was long gone somewhere else?\n\n'Then it changed and we were told the meet location was now Romania. We were then able to alert the Romanian authorities who did some brilliant work and they got him \u2013 detained with three mobile phones and counterfeit documentation.'\n\nDCI McHugh was there in person to watch the plane land when O'Brien was flown back to Britain.\n\nHe added: 'For me those three-and-a-half years until we got him were a lens into the pain a family without justice can suffer.\n\n'O'Brien was taken to Heathrow police station and I personally charged him, not something a DCI would normally do but I had to complete the story. He didn\u2019t react, didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n'It\u2019s been a long and complex investigation and we feel it. During the last almost four years, officers have joined my team, been promoted, retired \u2013 and two DCs died suddenly of cancer within six weeks of each other, DC Vennart who had taken that initial break-through call, and DC Bernie Looney, another hugely valued colleague and friend. So during the trial I had a lump in my throat as I heard evidence gathered by amazing officers who are no longer with us.\n\n'The Met, you have all been amazing and this success is down to your brilliance. It was a tough period but we got through it because every officer and member of staff in the Met is committed to solving crime and getting justice for grieving families.'", "description": "Shane O'Brien, 31, slashed the neck of Josh Hanson, 21, in an act of 'pitiless savagery' at a bar in Hillingdon, West London, before fleeing the UK in a private plane.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/12/20080752-0-image-a-31_1571830097797.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
