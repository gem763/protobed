Here we look at the rare earth elements required to power mass adoption, while future articles will explore infrastructure and supply chain requirements, as well shine a light on the work of the scientists striving to improve battery technology.\n\nAn hour\u2019s drive from Las Vegas, surrounded by scrub forest and Joshua trees, lies an open pit that holds the key to the future of the electric car.\n\nMountain Pass rare-earth mine is a rich source of neodymium and praseodymium, two metals which are used to make the magnets in the powertrain of an electric vehicle.\n\nIt is the only rare-earth mine in North America, and one of only a handful of active mines outside China.\n\nThe desert-bound mine, which reopened in 2018 after its previous owner went bankrupt, is seeking to challenge the overwhelming dominance of China in rare earth elements \u2013 a group of 17 minerals that are embedded in everything from electric cars to consumer gadgets.\n\nThe implications of this dominance, says James Litinsky, chief executive of the mine-owner JHL Capital Group, are \"pretty powerful\".\n\n\"Although rare earths is a few billion dollar industry, the ramifications for the global economy are quite large, with trillions in GDP and tens of millions of jobs,\" he says.", "description": "Part 1 of our week-long series exploring the global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) asked if EV technology had outstripped global readiness for the switch.", "authors": ["Tom Rees", "Vinjeru Mkandawire", "Olivia Rudgard", "Us Technology Reporter", "Hannah Betts", "Tom Hoggins", "James Titcomb"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/28/Capture-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2MfxYBFyJ_71J1uDNKnZO6fauVOnkS1JOfNnUyPyeeE.PNG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
