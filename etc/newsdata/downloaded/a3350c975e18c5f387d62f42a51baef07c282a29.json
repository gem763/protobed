He abandoned realist figurative painting \u2013 as Davie had \u2013 and moved to London to create vibrant abstract work.\n\nHockney poses in front of his painting 'Fred and Marcia Weisman' during a photo session at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, on June 16 in 2017\n\nThe letters were found in the archives of the gallery, during research for an exhibition of Hockney's work (pictured)\n\nSimon Wallis, director of The Hepworth Wakefield, said the exhibition would \u2018explore the creative journeys of two of the most remarkable British painters through a selection of their early works\u2019.\n\nHe claimed it would \u2018shine a light on the ambitious curatorial foresight of Wakefield Art Gallery\u2019, adding: \u2018The gallery helped boost Davie\u2019s career by organising a pivotal show that played a part in motivating a young David Hockney to develop his artistic voice.\u2019", "description": "David Hockney's invitation to Wakefield Art Gallery curator Helen Kapp to come to his show in Skipton, North Yorkshire, in 1960 was rejected in letters of excuses saying she had no car.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/22/19666748-0-image-a-19_1571000902128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
