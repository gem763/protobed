But the highest we'd like to have is a cap at around $10,\" Singh said.\n\nCare costing $10 per day would see a family spend about $200 per month per child.\n\nSingh repeatedly attacked the record of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, who he said \"walked away\" from families in need of child-care support.\n\nThe National's face-to-face interviews\n\nCBC is hosting a series of face-to-face interviews between undecided voters and federal leaders campaigning for next month's election.\n\nHow to watch:\n\nWatch the interviews on CBC News Network starting at 8 p.m. ET\n\nWatch on the CBC News App or CBC Gem at 8 p.m. ET\n\nWatch on The National at 10 p.m. on CBC TV across the country.\n\nSingh said Liberals had made a promise to help Canadians access affordable child-care even longer ago than their commitments on pharmacare, but nothing has materialized.\n\nChildren born when that first Liberal promise was made are now in need of child-care support for their own children, Singh said.\n\nIt was the NDP campaign's seventh straight day in British Columbia, where Singh has made several regionally focused announcements.\n\nSingh said B.C. is important to him because of its national importance, large population and his own seat in the area. But he said the campaign will move back east soon to Quebec and Ontario.", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is promising to spend $10 billion over the next four years to create 500,000 new child-care spaces in Canada.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302900.1569863240!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/fedelxn-ndp-20190929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
