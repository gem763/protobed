Can He Take the Hits?", "language": "en", "text": "Could Joe Biden lose it at Thursday\u2019s debate in Houston in a way that confirms he\u2019s too old, too old-fashioned, too tired, too \u201cget off my lawn\u201d for a party that\u2019s skewing young and moving left?\n\nSpoiler: Yes, and that\u2019s the anticipated plot of Thursday\u2019s debate. It will ostensibly be about health care, climate change, guns, gender issues, and education. But in reality all eyes will be on Biden to see if he can take a punch, or a dozen of them. It\u2019s not just Sen. Elizabeth Warren who\u2019s aiming for him, podium to podium for the first time with the leading candidate. All nine of the other Democrats on stage are poised for that moment when Biden\u2019s hair catches on fire. Each is \u201ca\u201d Biden vying to replace \u201cthe\u201d Biden.\n\nSo far Biden\u2019s faltered, but not enough to knock him out of first place. He wasn\u2019t ready for the left jab from Sen. Kamala Harris about how she was \u201cthat girl\u201d who was in a later class of children to be sent to a desegregated school because of his opposition to busing. It was more complicated than that, but the trusted vice president of the first black president seemed to think he was at a church picnic, and couldn\u2019t have been more stunned by the frontal attack. In his performances, he\u2019s been low energy. Who runs out of things to say and yields back their time?", "description": "I\u2019ll be watching him at the debate as I do a child at a piano recital: my fists clenched, braced for the first wrong note.", "authors": ["Margaret Carlson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568165498/190910-Carlson-Biden-tease_mvogks", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
