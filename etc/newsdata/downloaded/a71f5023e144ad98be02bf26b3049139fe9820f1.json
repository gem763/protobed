While the administration has tried to blunt the pain with two rounds of financial assistance, farmers have increasingly pleaded with the White House to end the trade war, saying the handouts are not enough to make up for the lost sales.\n\nThat pain was set to get worse next week. Until Friday\u2019s truce, Mr. Trump had planned to increase tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods to 30 percent from 25 percent, a hike that would likely have been met with further retaliation by China and been particularly burdensome for consumers and businesses going into the holiday season.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Trump-Trade-Deal-China.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
