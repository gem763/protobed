But Rountree added a short plunge for a 35-14 lead with a minute left in the third.\n\nPlumlee dashed in on a 9-yard quarterback draw and then on a 40-yard sprint, but McCann kicked his third field goal, a 38-yarder, in between to account for all the scoring in the fourth quarter.\n\nBoth teams continue conference play next Saturday as Missouri travels to Nashville, Tenn., to face Vanderbilt while Ole Miss hosts Texas A&M.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "Missouri's Larry Rountree III rushed for 126 yards and two touchdowns as the  Tigers stayed unbeaten in the SEC by defeating the Ole Miss Rebels, 38-27, in ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
