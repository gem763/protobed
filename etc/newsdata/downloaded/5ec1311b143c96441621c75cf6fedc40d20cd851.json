Tucker Carlson might need medical intervention.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump Trump awaits instructions from his Saudi masters. Having our country act as Saudi Arabia's bitch is not \"America First.\" https://t.co/kJOCpqwaQS \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) September 16, 2019\n\nNot the first time she\u2019s accused the president of being someone\u2019s \u201cbitch.\u201d She did it last November too in the context of \u2026 Saudi Arabia.\n\nHey @realdonaldtrump: being Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitch is not \u201cAmerica First.\u201d \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) November 21, 2018\n\nOn the one hand, I understand her objection. This Trump tweet makes it sound like the United States is taking foreign policy dictation from the Saudis. When did Mohammed bin Salman become National Security Advisor? On the other hand, it\u2019s awfully \u201con brand,\u201d shall we say, for Gabbard to be going to bat for Shiite interests. Nothing gets Assad\u2019s favorite candidate exercised to the point of calling the president of the United States a \u201cbitch\u201d like watching him take sides with Sunnis against Iran.\n\nPresumably Trump will reply later today by tweeting that Gabbard is \u201cAssad\u2019s bitch\u201d and then we\u2019ll have a dreary 24-hour news cycle of whether that\u2019s (a) sexist in context and (b) deserved. And then of course there\u2019ll be some Romneyesque reconciliation between the two in Trump\u2019s second term and she\u2019ll end up as Secretary of Defense, before being fired after six months once Trump realizes belatedly a la Bolton that her views on certain matters \u2014 like Iran vs. the Saudis \u2014 are diametrically opposed to his.\n\nThe irony of Gabbard demagoging him as the Saudis\u2019 bitch is that Trump has been remarkably open to diplomacy with Iran. This is the thanks he gets from her, apparently, for canceling a bombing run on Iran earlier this year that was endorsed by the hawks in his administration. Trump\u2019s willingness to consider suspending sanctions against Iran as a precondition to talks was reportedly the final straw for Bolton before he quit, in fact. In fairness to Gabbard, though, Trump has sounded more bellicose towards Iran in the past 48 hours, since that mysterious strike on Saudi oil facilities. And not just in the tweet she flagged him for:\n\nThe Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u201cNo Conditions.\u201d That is an incorrect statement (as usual!). \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s simply a lie. Trump has offered publicly to meet with Iran without preconditions more than once in the past 15 months, and as recently as June. Steve Mnuchin affirmed that Trump would meet without conditions just last week. Now suddenly POTUS is trying to gaslight people on that. Why? Has he shifted to a war footing with Iran and is trying to erase history, or is he just miffed that the Iranians have rejected his offers of presidential diplomacy unless and until the U.S. offers sanctions relief?\n\nThe big question: Why did Iran attack the Saudis now, and in particular why did they choose the manner that they did? Tehran\u2019s usual M.O. when hitting a rival is to create plausible deniability by blaming it on a proxy. Iran, you see, is a mature power and a responsible international actor; it\u2019s those darned woolly clients of theirs, like Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen, who occasionally get a little big for their britches. The wrinkle in that logic with the attack on the Saudi facility is that it appears to have been too comprehensive and sophisticated to have been carried out by the Houthis, who claimed responsibility. The missiles that struck the facility didn\u2019t even come from the direction of Yemen, reportedly. Iran\u2019s barely denying its role here, in other words, and by choosing Saudi oil capacity as its target it\u2019s not guilty of a minor attack that might otherwise be ignored in the name of keeping the peace internationally either. This was a gut punch to world energy markets. It\u2019s a big deal and their fingerprints are on it. Why would they do that at a moment when Trump\u2019s hawkish NSA just got fired and the president is thinking about easing sanctions in order to get Iran to talk?\n\nMaybe they\u2019re looking to drive up the price of their own oil by suddenly cutting the Saudis\u2019 supply. Or maybe it\u2019s as simple as them testing Trump to see how he\u2019ll react now that his most bellicose advisor is gone. Do they think he\u2019s so reluctant to go to war lest it screw up his reelection message that he\u2019ll let them slide on this and agree to talk anyway? It could be that Iran has decided to take him up on his offer to talk but the regime is worried that it\u2019ll be berated by hardliners at home for doing so. The only way to make talks acceptable to that group is to look tough first, such as by punching the Saudis in the face. Now if they extend an olive branch to Trump, they don\u2019t lose face. We\u2019ll see if he accepts it.\n\nExit quotation:", "description": "Given how heavily Trump fans and Tulsi fans seem to overlap, the cognitive dissonance caused by this tweet should be amazing to watch.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tg-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
