Since then, Alexa has spread out to countless devices, including many other models of Echo speakers within Amazon\u2019s own product lineup.\n\nThat makes the new $99.99 third-generation Echo speaker a curious beast. It is not the best-sounding Alexa speaker from Amazon (that would be the forthcoming Echo Studio), nor is it the least expensive Echo speaker (that\u2019s the Echo Dot). It isn\u2019t the most capable Echo speaker, either (both the Echo Plus and Echo Dot with clock technically do more).\n\nIt is, however, a relatively inexpensive smart speaker that sounds better than the small, hockey-puck-like Echo Dot or Google\u2019s Nest Home Mini, but doesn\u2019t take up as much space (or as much of your budget) as the Echo Studio. For an everyday smart speaker that you might use to listen to music, get weather reports, manage smart home devices, and add things to a shopping list, the latest Echo is more than capable.\n\nOur review of Amazon Echo (3rd Gen) Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Good volume and bass response\n\nMicrophones are excellent at picking up voice commands\n\nCosts less than high-end smart speakers Bad Stuff You can get the basics done for half the price with an Echo Dot\n\nSound can be muddy at times Buy for $99.99 from Amazon\n\nDesign-wise, the latest Echo is in fact exactly the same as the Echo Plus that came out last year. It\u2019s just under six inches tall, about four inches in diameter, and has a three-inch woofer and 0.8-inch tweeter inside of it. Put it next to the Echo Plus and you won\u2019t be able to visually tell them apart \u2014 the only difference between them is the Plus\u2019 ability to act as a hub for smart home devices, thanks to its built-in Zigbee radio.\n\nThat difference knocks $50 off the price and brings the new Echo in line with the price of the 2nd-gen model that came out in 2017. But the newer model has better sound and improved aesthetics, with a fabric wrap that matches the aesthetic of the Echo Dot. (The one thing you lose is the ability to change the look of the speaker with customizable shells, though I have a feeling few people actually took advantage of that and that\u2019s why Amazon dropped it.)\n\nJust like the Echo Plus, the new Echo sounds remarkably good, especially when you consider where Amazon was with the original model five years ago. It gets plenty loud enough to fill a medium size room with sound, the bass has an audible punch that was completely lacking in earlier models, and it has the ability to work in stereo with a second unit. It also has an excellent microphone array that hears my voice commands without requiring me to raise my voice, even when there\u2019s music playing. It\u2019s notable how far Amazon\u2019s Echo products have come in terms of design and performance in just a few short years.\n\nThe new Echo does not sound as good as a Sonos One, but it is half the price (and you can probably pick it up for even less, considering how often Amazon runs promotions on Echo hardware). It does lack the clarity and crispness of a more expensive speaker, with mid-tones getting lost in the mix. And its bass punch doesn\u2019t match what the Sonos offers. But I don\u2019t think most people paying less than $100 for a smart speaker will have an issue with its sound, and it is considerably better-sounding than Google\u2019s more expensive Home speaker.\n\nIf you own one of the first-gen Echo speakers, you will find this one sounds considerably better, with much better bass response. Compared to a 2nd-gen model however, the difference is less noticeable, and probably not worth the upgrade.\n\nThe other thing to consider here is the Echo Dot, which is half the price of the Echo and takes up even less space on a shelf. The Echo Dot does sound remarkably good for its size and price, but the larger Echo has better bass response and a louder top volume. There is something you get when you spend a little more.\n\nAgree to Continue: Amazon Echo (3rd gen) Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. In order to use the Amazon Echo, you\u2019ll need to download the Alexa app for iOS and Android. An Amazon account is required to sign in. By signing up for one of those, you must agree to its conditions of use. After that, the Alexa app will ask what sort of device you want to connect with. Just know that once you click on the device, you agree to a whole host of mandatory terms. In Amazon\u2019s own words: \u201cBy proceeding, you agree to Amazon\u2019s conditions of use and all of the terms found here.\u201d You can explore the documentation at that link, but below, we\u2019ve listed the 12 terms that you must agree to. Alexa Terms of Use\n\nAmazon Conditions of Use\n\nAmazon Privacy Policy\n\nChildren\u2019s Privacy Disclosure\n\nAmazon Prime Terms\n\nAmazon Music Terms of Use\n\nKindle Store Terms of Use\n\nAudible Service Conditions of Use\n\nAmazon Dash Replenishment Terms of Use\n\nAmazon FreeTime Unlimited Terms & Conditions, and Kindle FreeTime Unlimited T&C\n\nAmazon Photos Terms of Use\n\nAmazon Device Terms of Use Final tally: 13 mandatory agreements\n\nAll of these things make the Echo a bit of a middle child in Amazon\u2019s lineup. If you\u2019re looking for a competent smart speaker that will sound good for most everything you need it to, but don\u2019t want to spend more than a Benjamin, it is perhaps the best option available right now.", "description": "Amazon\u2019s latest Echo speaker sounds better than ever, but has a lot of competition within Amazon\u2019s own lineup, not to mention from other smart speakers.", "authors": ["Dan Seifert", "Oct", "Photography Chris Welch", "The Verge"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_NLPWwmB9Yi1_4fRCXT-_kggabE=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19298919/cwelch_191016_3739_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
