That\u2019s the pedestrian conclusion at which I arrived after recently re-reading the address given by one of the nineteenth century\u2019s greatest theologians, Blessed John Henry Newman, when Pope Leo XIII made him a cardinal on May 12, 1879.\n\nKnown as the Biglietto Speech (after the formal letter given to cardinals on such occasions), its 1720 words constitute a systematic indictment of what Newman called that \u201cone great mischief\u201d against which he had set his face \u201cfrom the first.\u201d Today, I suspect, the sheer force of Newman\u2019s critique of what he called \u201cliberalism in religion\u201d would make him persona non grata in most Northern European theology faculties.\n\nWhen reflecting upon Newman\u2019s remarks, it\u2019s hard not to notice how much of the Christian world in the West has drifted in the directions against which he warned. Under the banner of \u201cliberalism in religion,\u201d Newman listed several propositions. These included (1) \u201cthe doctrine that there is no positive truth in religion,\u201d (2) \u201cthat one creed is as good as another,\u201d (3) that no religion can be recognized as true for \u201call are matter of opinion,\u201d (4) that \u201crevealed religion is not a truth, but a sentiment and a taste; not an objective faith, not miraculous,\u201d and (5) \u201cit is the right of each individual to make it say just what strikes his fancy.\u201d\n\nCan anyone doubt that such ideas are widespread today among some Christians? Exhibit A are the rapidly-collapsing liberal Protestant confessions. Another instance is that fair number of Catholic clergy and laity of a certain age who shy away from the word \u201ctruth\u201d and who regard any doctrine that conflicts with the post-1960s Western world\u2019s expectations as far from settled. Yet Newman\u2019s description of liberal religion also accurately summarizes the essentially secular I\u2019m-spiritual-not-religious mindset.\n\nAt the time, the directness of Newman\u2019s assault on liberal religion surprised people. It wasn\u2019t for idle reasons that the speech was reprinted in full in The London Times on 13 May, and then translated into Italian so that it could appear in the Holy See\u2019s own newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano on 14 May. Everyone recognized that Newman\u2019s words were of immense significance.\n\nThe newly-minted cardinal had hitherto been seen as someone ill-at-ease with the Church\u2019s direction during Pius IX\u2019s pontificate. Newman\u2019s apprehensions about the opportuneness of the First Vatican Council formally defining papal infallibility were well-known. Not well-understood was that concerns about Catholics being misled into thinking they must assent to a pope\u2019s firm belief that, for example, the optimal upper-tax rate is 25.63 percent, didn\u2019t mean that you regarded religious belief as a type of theological smorgasbord.\n\nThose who had followed the trajectory of Newman\u2019s thought over the previous fifty years would have recognized that the Biglietto Speech harkened back to a younger Newman and a consistent record of fierce opposition to liberal religion. In 1848, for instance, Newman had lampooned liberal religion in his novel Loss and Gain (1848). One character in the book, the Dean of Nottingham, is portrayed as someone who believes that \u201cthere was no truth or falsehood in received dogmas of theology; that they were modes, neither good nor bad in themselves, but personal, national, or periodic.\u201d\n\nSuch opinions mirror the views of those today who primarily regard Scripture, the Church and Christian faith as essentially human historical constructs: a notion that invariably goes hand-in-hand with a barely-disguised insistence that the Church always requires wholesale adaptation to whatever happens to be the zeitgeist. The end-result is chronic doctrinal instability (and thus incoherence) and the degeneration of churches into mere NGO-ism: precisely the situation which characterizes contemporary Catholicism in the German-speaking world.\n\nAnother of the novel\u2019s characters is Mr. Batts, the director of the Truth Society. This organization is founded on two principles. First, it is uncertain whether truth exists. Second, it is certain that it cannot be found. Welcome to the world of philosophical skepticism which, Newman understood, is based on the contradiction of holding that we know the truth that humans really cannot know truth.\n\nNewman\u2019s antagonism towards liberal religion, however, also reflected another side of his thought that, I suspect, some today would also prefer to ignore. This concerns Newman\u2019s critical view of liberalism as a social philosophy.\n\nNewman was fully aware of the ambiguity surrounding terms like \u201cconservatism\u201d and \u201cliberalism.\u201d In his Apologia Pro Sua Vita (1864), Newman specified that his criticism of liberalism shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as slighting French Catholics such as Charles de Montalembert and the Dominican priest Henri-Dominique Lacordaire\u2014\u201ctwo men whom I so highly admire\u201d\u2014who embraced the liberal label but in the context of post-Revolutionary France: a world which differed greatly from the Oxford and England of Newman\u2019s time.\n\nWe get closer to the \u201cliberalism\u201d against which Newman protested when we consider a letter to his mother dated 13 March 1829. Here Newman condemns, among others, \u201cthe Utilitarians\u201d and \u201cuseful knowledge men\u201d whose ideas were propagated by philosophical Radical periodicals such as the Westminster Review. These beliefs and publications were clearly associated with utilitarian thinkers and political radicals such as Jeremy Bentham (the Westminster Review\u2019s founder), James Mill and, later, John Stuart Mill. In this sense, liberalism was Newman\u2019s way of describing what we today call doctrinaire secularism.\n\nThis is borne out by the Biglietto Speech\u2019s portrayal of a society\u2019s fate as it gradually abandons its Christian character, invariably at the behest of those Newman calls \u201cPhilosophers and Politicians.\u201d Newman begins by referencing their imposition of \u201ca universal and a thoroughly secular education, calculated to bring home to every individual that to be orderly, industrious, and sober, is his personal interest.\u201d\n\nRecognizing, however, that utility, pragmatism and self-interest aren\u2019t enough to glue society together, liberals promote, according to Newman, an alternative to revealed religion. This, he says, is made up of an amalgam of \u201cbroad fundamental ethical truths, of justice, benevolence, veracity, and the like; proved experience; and those natural laws which exist and act spontaneously in society, and in social matters, whether physical or psychological; for instance, in government, trade, finance, sanitary experiments, and the intercourse of nations.\u201d But while liberals uphold this mixture of particular moral principles, matter-of-factness and science, Newman points out that they simultaneously insist that religion is \u201ca private luxury, which a man may have if he will; but which of course he must pay for, and which he must not obtrude upon others, or indulge in to their annoyance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not, Newman says, that things like \u201cthe precepts of justice, truthfulness, sobriety, self-command, benevolence\u201d etc. are bad in themselves. In fact, Newman adds, \u201cthere is much in the liberalistic theory which is good and true.\u201d Nor did Newman adopt an \u201canti-science\u201d view at a time when some Christians worried about how to reconcile the Scriptures with the tremendous expansion in knowledge of the natural world which marked the nineteenth century. Newman wasn\u2019t, for example, especially troubled by Darwin\u2019s Origin of the Species. As he wrote to the biologist and Catholic convert St George Jackson Mivart in 1871, \u201cyou must not suppose I have personally any great dislike or dread of his theory.\u201d\n\nWhat Newman opposed was a problem with which we are all too familiar today. This consists of (1) absolutizing the natural sciences as the only objective form of knowledge and (2) using the empirical method to answer theological and moral questions that the natural sciences cannot answer.\n\nIn such cases, Newman wrote in his Idea of a University (1852), \u201cthey exceed their proper bounds, and intrude where they have no right.\u201d It also fosters a mentality which has seeped into the minds of those Christians who prioritize sociology, psychology, opinion-polls, and what they imagine to be the \u201cestablished scientific position\u201d when discussing what the Catholic position on any subject should be.\n\nMore generally, Newman argued that it\u2019s precisely because these principles are un-objectionable in themselves that they become dangerous when liberals include them in the \u201carray of principles\u201d they use \u201cto supersede, to block out, religion.\u201d In these circumstances, those who maintain that religion, in the sense of divinely-revealed truths about God and man, cannot be relegated to the status of football teams competing in a private league are dismissed as unreasonable, intolerant, lacking benevolence, unscientific, and reflective of (to use the curious words employed in a recent L\u2019Osservatore Romano opinion piece) a \u201cmodest cultural level.\u201d In a word\u2014illiberal.\n\nNewman well-understood the ultimate stakes involved in the advance of liberal religion and the nihilism it concealed under a veneer of progressive Western European bourgeois morality. It was nothing less, he said, than \u201cthe ruin of many souls.\u201d For Newman, there was always the serious possibility that error at the level of belief can contribute to people making the type of free choices which lead to the eternal separation from God we call hell.\n\nThe good news is that Newman had \u201cno fear at all that [liberal religion] can really do aught of serious harm to the Word of God, to Holy Church.\u201d For Newman, the Church was essentially indestructible. That didn\u2019t mean it would be free of disputation or disruption. Newman himself spent his life immersed in theological controversies. But Newman\u2019s deep knowledge of the Church Fathers made him conscious that orthodoxy had been under assault since Christianity\u2019s earliest centuries.\n\nNewman believed, however, in Christ\u2019s promises to his Church. Moreover, Newman ended his Biglietto Speech by stating that \u201cwhat is commonly a great surprise\u201d is \u201cthe particular mode by which . . . Providence rescues and saves his elect inheritance.\u201d Even in times where serious theological and moral error seems rampant, God raises up courageous bishops and priests, clear-thinking popes, new religious orders and movements, lay people who reject liberal Christianity\u2019s mediocrity and soft-nihilism, and, above all, great saints and martyrs.\n\nAgainst such things, Newman knew\u2014and we should have confidence\u2014liberal religion doesn\u2019t have a chance.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article was originally posted on July 30, 2017; it is reposted in light of news that Newman will be canonized on October 13 in Rome.", "description": "", "authors": ["About Dr. Samuel Gregg", "Robert J Amann", "Mrscracker", "Robert J Amann On", "Mrscracker On", "Pat On"], "top_image": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files.catholicworldreport.com/2018/04/jhnewman_painting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-02"}
