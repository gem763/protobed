Bush, mentioned Vindman\u2019s qualifications and achievements, which include serving in Iraq and earning a Purple Heart. She went in for the kill by mentioning that Vindman joined the National Security Council last year after passing an extensive background check, \u201cunlike some other West Wing advisers we know.\u201d\n\nThat appeared to be a dig at Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, who only received a security clearance in May 2018 after longstanding scrutiny over his alleged meetings with foreign officials.\n\nWallace then went after Ingraham, Yoo and former Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.), who suggested on CNN that Vindman\u2019s loyalty might be suspect because he was born in Ukraine before his family moved to the United States.\n\nShe didn\u2019t mince words, either.\n\nAfter playing a clip of Yoo saying \u201csome people\u201d might call Vindman\u2019s work \u201cespionage,\u201d she jumped in.\n\n\u201cExcept those people aren\u2019t chickenshit like the three of you,\u201d Wallace said, \u201cand they know he passed a background check that the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYou can see the segment in the tweet below:\n\nNicole Wallace hits back at Laura Ingraham, John Yoo and Sean Duffy for their attacks on Vindman's patriotism: \"except those people aren't chickenshit like the three of you and they know that he passed a background check that the President's daughter and son-in-law didn't.\" pic.twitter.com/2tiQPw8lsb \u2014 Amee Vanderpool (@girlsreallyrule) October 29, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, Wallace\u2019s burn has made her a hot topic on Twitter.\n\nShe didn\u2019t hit back at them. She ran them over with a zamboni of truth. \u2014 Stuart Parsons (@weallscrewed) October 29, 2019\n\nNicole Wallace calling Laura Ingraham \u201cchickenshit\u201d is better for my soul than any cute kitten video ever. pic.twitter.com/1QrpqCTsaJ \u2014 SeanKentComedy (@seankent) October 29, 2019\n\nNicole Wallace was like\n\nI get paid enough I don\u2019t mind taking a penalty just to call Laura Ingraham a chickenshit in a close crop lookin like pic.twitter.com/qwxZDOeq9I \u2014 elseedubya (@elseedubya) October 29, 2019\n\nMashup of a sports bar cheering and Nicolle Wallace calling Laura Ingraham chicken shit pic.twitter.com/H3P6fEdACK \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) October 29, 2019", "description": "Wallace also threw shade at Jared Kushner by pointing out that Alexander Vindman was at least able to pass a background check.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db8ca0c2000009933507286.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
