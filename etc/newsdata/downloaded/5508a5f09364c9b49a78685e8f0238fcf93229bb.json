Assuming that paying on time is enough for a good score\n\nIf you\u2019re routinely charging a large chunk of your credit limit on a card, paying your bill in full every month may not help your credit score as much as you think it will.\n\nPaying on time is just one of two major influences on your score. The other is \u201ccredit utilization,\u201d the portion of your credit card limits you\u2019re using. Experts suggest using no more than 30% of the limit on any card, and lower is better.\n\nUsing credit lightly demonstrates responsible borrowing to lenders, explains Amy Thomann, head of consumer credit education at TransUnion, a credit bureau. But high credit utilization is \u201cpredictive of risk,\u201d Ulzheimer says, and hurts your score.\n\nWhat to do instead: Make sure your credit utilization stays below 30% throughout the billing cycle. You can make multiple small payments throughout the month to keep the balance consistently low relative to your limit.\n\n2. Closing a credit card\n\nYou may think a credit card that sits in a drawer unused is just clutter and decide to close it. But it can still help your credit. And the higher its credit limit, the more it helps. That\u2019s because your total credit utilization matters as well as per-card credit usage.\n\nRelated: 4 biggest mistakes most people make with credit-card rewards\n\nClosing a credit card reduces your overall credit limit, which can send your overall utilization up, hurting your score.\n\nWhat to do instead: Keep credit cards open, unless you have a compelling reason to close them. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need a credit card, but it has a high credit limit or has been open a long time, you might want to keep it open and use it to make small purchases that you pay off on time,\u201d Thomann says. Regular use guards against the issuer closing the account for inactivity.\n\n3. Paying off a loan early\n\nIf you can pay off your loan and get it done early, what\u2019s not to like about you as a credit customer? But don\u2019t expect the credit gods to cheer.\n\nPaying a loan early has no effect on your credit score. But having fewer credit accounts can hurt by reducing the overall age and mix of your accounts.\n\nRead: The $3 billion mistake Americans are making with their credit cards\n\nWhat to do instead: Focus on what\u2019s best for your finances. If you have a 0% loan, there\u2019s not a lot of incentive to pay early. If you have a loan charging 29% interest, though, there is. The potential for a dip in your score from having fewer credit accounts is not a good reason to continue to pay a lot of interest if you can avoid it.\n\n4. Sending in a partial payment\n\nThere is a persistent myth that paying something \u2014 even if you cannot pay the minimum \u2014 will keep you from being sent to collections. It makes sense to believe a creditor would rather have a partial payment than nothing.\n\nBut that strategy won\u2019t keep you out of collections. It won\u2019t even keep you from being reported late. If you don\u2019t pay at least the minimum by 30 days past the due date, the creditor can report your account as delinquent to the credit bureaus.\n\nWhat to do instead: If you are unable to pay even the minimums, talk with a nonprofit credit counselor.\n\n5. Rejecting a higher credit limit\n\nThe more available credit you have, the more likely you are to go into debt, right? That\u2019s not what the data shows, and credit scores are all about statistics and probability. A higher credit limit is generally a good thing unless you\u2019re sure it will tempt you to overspend.\n\nNext up: Why you should have an international credit card\n\nWhat to do instead: Accept the higher limit and keep your spending steady. That will lower your credit utilization.\n\nThree simple rules\n\nBuilding credit can sound complicated because there are several factors, and they interact. But knowing what\u2019s important, and acting accordingly, can get you a good score.\n\nJust follow three rules:\n\nPay on time, every time.\n\nUse less than 30% of your credit limits.\n\nKeep an eye on everything else.\n\n\u201cEverything else\u201d means the accuracy of your credit reports, the age of your credit, whether you have both credit cards and loans, and how many. But those factors matter much less than paying on time and keeping credit utilization low.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Here are 5 reasonable-sounding credit moves that could lead to trouble \u2014 and what to do instead.", "authors": ["Bev O Shea"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ152_nerd_c_ZG_20190826134336.jpg"}
