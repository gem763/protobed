Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d He quickly deleted it and apologized, saying he \u201cdid not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China.\u201d\n\nHowever, backlash toward Morey and the NBA has continued. Chinese fans and the team\u2019s partners in Beijing have expressed outrage at the NBA executive for backing the Chinese-ruled region, where protesters have for months been holding pro-democracy demonstrations that have led to violent clashes with police.\n\nMeanwhile, others, including a bipartisan group of lawmakers, have bashed the NBA for caving to China rather than defending freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous that the NBA has caved to Chinese government demands for contrition,\u201d Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and a handful of others wrote in a letter addressed to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver last week.\n\nJames later clarified in a tweet that he was not commenting on Morey\u2019s tweet itself \u2015 or \u201cthe substance\u201d of the tweet \u2015 but rather on the coach\u2019s act of tweeting something political without thinking about the consequences.\n\n\u201cI believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen,\u201d James said in a two-part tweet. \u201cCould have waited a week to send it... I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet.\u201d\n\nMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nLet me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 15, 2019\n\nWhen asked by reporters about Morey\u2019s tweet before the game, James said it\u2019s important for players to \u201cjust be careful what we tweet and say and we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d\n\nAfter a video of James\u2019 comments surfaced on social media, many criticized the player for his take.\n\nAlways been a Lebron fan but he\u2019s off on this one. pic.twitter.com/9v5w4Q3vwP \u2014 Bryan Greenberg (@bryangreenberg) October 15, 2019\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure LeBron just undid four years of takes in an hour. \u2014 Jack Dickey (@jackdickey) October 15, 2019\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called James\u2019 statement \u201cunbelievable\u201d in a tweet.\n\nHaving just been in Hong Kong - on the streets & with the protestors - this kind of garbage is hard to take. LeBron, are YOU educated on \u201cthe situation\u201d? Why don\u2019t you go to Hong Kong? Why don\u2019t you meet the people there risking their lives for their most basic liberties https://t.co/KvphH9RiAl \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cNews flash: people ARE being harmed - shot, beaten, gassed - right now in Hong Kong. By China,\u201d Hawley added. \u201cBy the Communist Party the NBA is so eager to appease.\u201d\n\nThis statement is unbelievable. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed\u201d? By Daryl Morey daring to express sympathy for democracy? News flash: people ARE being harmed - shot, beaten, gassed - right now in Hong Kong. By China. By the Communist Party the NBA is so eager to appease \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 15, 2019\n\nSasse accused James of \u201cparroting communist propaganda.\u201d\n\n.@KingJames \u2014 you\u2019re parroting communist propaganda. China is running torture camps and you know it. #GoogleUyghurs https://t.co/BExRpi02EB \u2014 Senator Ben Sasse (@SenSasse) October 15, 2019\n\nJames reportedly raised concerns regarding how the players should handle questions while playing overseas in a meeting with the Lakers, the Brooklyn Nets and Silver last week.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, which first reported news of the meeting, James expressed that \u201che believed that Silver and the NBA needed to explain and articulate the situation first, before the players would have to.\u201d\n\nMany in the NBA, including Golden State star Stephen Curry and his coach Steve Kerr, have been reluctant to voice their thoughts on the situation amid escalating tension between the NBA and China.\n\nLast week, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV announced it would end its current broadcast arrangement to air the NBA\u2019s preseason games in China.", "description": "The Lakers forward shared his thoughts on the Houston Rockets general manager's tweet in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da52d77210000510facdd31.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
