Things that he'd bought me, places we'd been, things I was wearing were popping up in the newspapers.\n\n\"It is heartbreaking to think that someone so close to you would sell stories and leak things like that so I totally get where [Coleen's] coming from.\"\n\nHost Victoria then asked Chantelle if she ever found out who the culprit was.\n\n\"I've got a good idea but if I had the proof and hard evidence like Coleen has, where its come from, hard evidence, then I'd probably out them as well,\" added Chantelle.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nDerbyshire then asked Chantelle if she thought Coleen had done the right thing by making the row so public.\n\n\"There's only so much you can take and and Coleen's a very private person,\" said Chantelle.\n\n\"Why not go public it might bring whoever it was out of the woodwork sooner,\" she added.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)\n\npoll loading Was Coleen right to publicly name Vardy as leak? 500+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO\n\nYesterday, Coleen told how she had planted fake stories on her private Instagram and only allowed the account belonging to Rebekah Vardy to view them to see if they got leaked to the press.\n\n\"And you know what, what they did!\" Coleen told her followers, adding that she has screen shotted proof of her claims.\n\nA spokesperson for Rebekah told the Victoria Derbysire Show that she'd been left very upset by Coleen's accusations and had instructed lawyers to do a forensic investigation to find who has been accessing her Instagram account.\n\nRebekah said in a statement to Coleen: \"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself. I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\"\n\n(Image: coleem_rooney/Instagram)\n\nColeen had gone public with her accusations earlier on Wednesday.\n\nShe told her followers: \"For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing [a national newspaper] of my private posts and stories.\n\n\"There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n\"After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\"\n\nColeen then revealed how she formulated a plan to catch who was responsible.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nTo try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\"Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into [the newspaper].\n\n\"And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\"It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have ben leaked, however I had to. \"Now I know for certain which account / individual it's come from.\n\n\"I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's..........Rebekah Vardy's account.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n37-year-old Rebekah, who is pregnant with her fifth child, tweeted out: \"As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n\"I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n\"If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n\"Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself. \"I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\n\"I liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\n\"I'm disgusted that I'm even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\"", "description": "Chantelle Heskey said she would have taken Coleen Rooney's name and shame approach if she'd had the same 'hard evidence'", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Bbc", "Daily Mirror", "Internet Unknown", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images", "Coleem_Rooney Instagram", "Getty Images", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551536.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Emile-Heskys-wife-Chantelle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
