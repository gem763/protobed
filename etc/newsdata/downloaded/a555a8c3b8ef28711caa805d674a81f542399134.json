Well, here's your chance.\n\nFT, the publisher of the daily business newspaper, created a game that makes you CEO and founder of tech startup FlexBird. Your job is to take the company public in an IPO and to guide the business to success. Along the way, you can choose how you allocate resources to growth and social issues, but make sure you keep stakeholders and investors happy!\n\nYou'll also have to deal with other events as they come up, like protests over government contracts and a recession. Do you have what it takes?\n\nHere's what happened when I played.\n\nThe game starts by giving you the basics: you're the CEO of FlexBird, and you have to make it through the next 4 years.\n\nYou have to keep stakeholders and investors happy.\n\nBefore the IPO, you have a chance to set up what kind of company you will run.\n\nYou have 10 resources to allocate to 4 possible areas.\n\nI spread my resources pretty evenly. I decided to focus on meeting growth targets and social responsibility, because it seemed like it had something for both groups I was trying to win over.\n\nLet's see how my picks played out.\n\nGrowth targets didn't do so well, even though I gave 3 resources.\n\nSocial responsibility is off to a good start.\n\nSeems like I didn't pay enough attention to environmental sustainability.\n\nLong term growth is decent, and we're off!\n\nQuestions about a startup with government contracts sound familiar.\n\nThis could be inspired by many real-life startups. IT automation firm Chef declined to renew its contract with ICE in September. More than 1,200 students around the country pledged not to work with data company Palantir unless it stopped working with ICE.\n\nThe majority of players made the same choice as me and dropped the contract.\n\nA trade war is not good news for me.\n\nThis year I only have 8 resources, so I gave 2 to each sector.\n\nShort term growth isn't going so well.\n\nNeither is environmental responsibility.\n\nIn a very gig-economy move, I hired freelancers to avoid paying for benefits.\n\nAnd now I have echoes of WeWork, renting out space to other startups.\n\nNow I have to decide whether I should fire the company barista. So many tough calls!\n\nMost players agreed with me and fired the barista, and it worked!\n\nFlexBird needs a little help, so we brought in investor Purposework Capital. Could this be our SoftBank?\n\nSoftBank backed companies like WeWork and Uber, which have faced a failed IPO and a drop in valuation.\n\nThis time, I decided to focus more on growth and social responsibility.\n\nBanning meat from company functions is definitely a Neumann reference.\n\nThe WeWork founder reportedly ate a giant lamb shank at a company dinner after banning meat.\n\nSome of my earlier investment are paying off.\n\nI didn't put many resources toward environmental responsibility, but I can at least let my employees join the global climate strike.\n\nInvestors didn't like it, but stakeholders did.\n\nFor my last year, I get to set the tone for my legacy.\n\nI think I won. Investors aren't thrilled with me, but I ended with slightly higher than average investor approval, and more than double average stakeholder approval.", "description": "As CEO, you must keep stakeholders and investors happy by choosing how to use your resources effectively.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2874/a24211febd4a4d9d954760d4e8ed3d3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
