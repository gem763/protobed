Few men take it.\n\nThe case highlights the challenge of bolstering the role of women in the workplace, championed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s \u201cWomenomics\u201d programme, in a society where social norms discourage men from taking on child rearing or housework.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of people who want to take childcare leave, as it\u2019s their right, but they cannot because their workplace makes it difficult. Someone had to speak up,\u201d the Asics employee said.\n\nThe man says he was transferred to a warehouse operated by an Asics subsidiary after he returned from his first paternity leave.\n\nIt was not an official demotion or a pay cut, but the job involved carrying and unloading heavy boxes \u2014 a big change from his previous role in Asics\u2019 personnel department.\n\nHe hired a lawyer and complained to his bosses. Asics allowed him to return to a desk job, but gave him what he said were meaningless tasks, such as translating company guidelines into English.\n\nThat situation has continued since the end of his second parental leave earlier this year, he said.\n\nAsics said it had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with the worker\u2019s legal and union representatives, and \u201clooks forward to making the truth clear\u201d in court.\n\nA Gold Partner sponsor for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, the company bills itself as a socially progressive and inclusive company.\n\n\u201cWe put effort into fostering diversity, and we will continue to make greater efforts to ensure our work environment and policies allow people to remain active through pregnancy, birth and childcare,\u201d Asics said in a statement to Reuters.\n\n\u201cPATAHARA\u201d\n\nThe Asics case follows other similar disputes.\n\nGlen Wood, a former equity sales manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, is suing the brokerage for harassment after he returned from paternity leave. The company has denied the allegations.\n\nChemical firm Kaneka Corp was criticised in June after an employee\u2019s wife said on social media her husband was told to move from Tokyo to the company\u2019s Osaka office after taking a month of parental leave and denied his request for a postponement.\n\nKaneka has said the relocation was appropriate and not punishment for taking paternity leave. The worker has since quit.\n\nThe cases have given rise to a new phrase, \u201cpatahara\u201d, short for paternity harassment and modelled on the more common term \u201cmatahara\u201d, or maternity harassment, used to describe abuse experienced by working mothers.\n\nLabour lawyer Yoshitatsu Imaizumi, who is representing Wood, said such lawsuits are rare because few male workers feel they can take action.\n\n\u201cYou could say we\u2019re seeing the tip of the iceberg in that there are many more people who want to take childcare leave, but feel they can\u2019t, or run into trouble when they try,\u201d he said.\n\nOnly 6 percent of eligible fathers took childcare leave last year, and most of them took less than a week off, according to government data.\n\nWhile the take-up is double the 3 percent rate of a few years ago, it is far short of the 13 percent target set by the government for 2020.\n\nThe government is struggling to meet other gender equality targets, such as women occupying a third of corporate and public sector leadership roles by next year. Women currently hold just 4% of corporate board seats, according to Tokyo Shoko Research.\n\nNiki Harada, president of the Tokyo Youth Union which represents young workers, said men were beginning to grapple with some of the same issues faced by women for decades.\n\n\u201cAs more men take part in rearing children, the disadvantages that women have been experiencing, around having children and taking childcare leave, are now being experienced by men,\u201d he said.\n\n($1 = 105.3900 yen)", "description": "A male employee is suing sportswear maker Asics Corp for alleged mistreatment after taking paternity leave, a case that has shone a spotlight on gender equality and workers' rights in Japan.", "authors": ["Ritsuko Ando", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
