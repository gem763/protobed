A national-record winning streak of 14 matches. A place atop the world rankings for the first time in the rugby-mad country\u2019s history, even if only for a week.\n\nThrow in his success as head coach of the British and Irish Lions - a series win in Australia in 2013 followed by a drawn series against the All Blacks in 2017 - and there\u2019s only really one major feat that has proved beyond Gatland since taking the reins in December 2007.\n\nWinning the Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe 2019 edition in Japan offers the New Zealander one last chance before he returns home to Hamilton to coach the Chiefs in Super Rugby. And it might be Wales\u2018 best opportunity since the inception of the World Cup in 1987.\n\nForget about a couple of warmup losses to England and Ireland this past month; the Welsh are heading to Asia in great shape, mentally as much as physically.\n\nOK, they didn\u2019t beat New Zealand in that 14-match winning run from March 2018 to March 2019 which bounced them from No. 8 in the rankings to No. 1. Yet they took down South Africa twice, Australia, England, Ireland, and Argentina.\n\nA team that didn\u2019t know how to get over the line in big, tight matches suddenly forgot how to lose. For that, they can largely thank Gatland.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a really special place in my heart for Wales,\u201d Gatland said after his last home test in charge of Wales, which unfortunately proved to be a 22-17 loss to Ireland after fielding a weakened lineup.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve massively overachieved in the last 12 years. And we\u2019re not finished yet.\u201d\n\nIn World Cups under Gatland, the Welsh reached the semifinals in 2011, where they lost to France after playing more than an hour with 14 men following the contentious sending-off of Sam Warburton for a tip tackle. In 2015, Wales got out of a pool containing Australia and ousted host nation England before losing 23-19 to South Africa in the quarterfinals.\n\nWales\u2018 last game before Gatland took over as coach was a humiliating 38-34 loss to Fiji in Nantes in the 2007 World Cup, which eliminated the Dragons in the pool stage.\n\nSo much has changed since then, especially the strength in depth in the squad which should leave Wales fans\u2019 confident the team can overcome injuries to No. 8 Taulupe Faletau and flyhalf Gareth Anscombe that have ruled them out of the World Cup.\n\nRoss Moriarty provides strong cover for Faletau at No. 8, while Dan Biggar now takes on a huge role at No. 10.\n\nWales and Australia are the favorites to advance from Pool D, which also includes Fiji, Georgia and Uruguay.\n\nThe mercurial Fijians stand out as the other danger, with the Welsh no doubt wary of a repeat of 2007 but also because Fiji is now in the top 10 of the world rankings and seemingly a more cohesive unit than ahead of previous World Cups.\n\nPerhaps crucially, Wales will have 10 days to prepare for Fiji on Oct. 9, which will be the third pool game for Gatland\u2019s squad. It will be Fiji\u2019s final pool game, coming just six days after a meeting with Georgia.\n\nGet through what could be a grueling pool and Wales will be hardened for the knockout stage, and Gatland\u2019s final days at the helm.\n\nHow fitting if he goes out as the first Wales coach to win the World Cup.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Warren Gatland has achieved almost everything during his tenure as Wales coach over the last 12 years.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
