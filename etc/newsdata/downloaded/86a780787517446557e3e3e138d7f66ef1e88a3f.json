His signature character, Companion, now bobs gently in the water, arms stretched out and facing the sky.\n\n\"I wanted to create a work that was really about just relaxing -- taking time for yourself and just laying down and looking up,\" said Brian Donnelly -- also known as KAWS -- ahead of its launch.\n\nThe 37-meter-long (121-foot) sculpture weighs more than 40 tons, thanks largely to the steel pontoon it's affixed to.\n\nKAWS' new work lowered gently into the sea at the shipyards in Tsing Yi, Hong Kong.

While Hofman's duck sat on a simple, circular pontoon weighing about 5 tons, Companion rests on a diamond-shaped one weighing eight times that.\n\nThen there was the matter of transporting it from the shipyard to Victoria Harbour.\n\n\"(We had to make) all these different kind of arrangements because the artwork cannot (simply) float to location, you need two tugboats to pull it from Tsing Yi to Central,\" Lam said, adding that the process took around eight hours.\n\nSlightly smaller versions of the project, named \"KAWS: Holiday,\" have appeared in front of Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and in Seoul's Seokchon Lake.

The artwork, titled \"KAWS: Holiday,\" seems destined to become an Instagram favorite and a talking point among locals.\n\nA diver helping with the project, Chan Kwok Yung, described it as \"a cute, dead body,\" while a shipyard worker likened the sculpture to Hello Kitty. \"When people see it, they will feel relaxed,\" said Cheung Shu Fook, the captain of a small boat.\n\n\"That's really the beauty of public art,\" Donnelly said of the varying reactions he expects the work to attract. \"You get people from all different backgrounds coming in and encountering it (and) taking from it what they will. I don't try to say exactly what they need to feel when they see a work. It's just what it is to them, what their history is and their associations.\"", "description": "A 37-meter-long (121-foot) inflatable sculpture will be one of the most visible works of art during the city's arts month.", "authors": ["Stephy Chung", "Hong Kong", "Herbert Chow", "Daniel Campisi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190325102137-kaws-hong-kong-1-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-25"}
