Not only is Marion Logan trying to take custody of Max Turner (Harry McDermott) from them but David is not looking at a much longer prison sentence as he has been set up for the attempted murder of Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton).\n\nAfter Josh was stabbed in the melee of a prison riot, Abe ensured that David took the fall for it and the police certainly think they have their man. Even David\u2019s own loved ones doubt his innocence, with Gail Rodwell (Helen Worth) so sure that he won\u2019t be released in time for the wedding that she cancels it on Shona\u2019s behalf! You can imagine how that goes down\u2026\n\nThings look even more bleak when a remorseless Josh once again decides to look out for himself and lies to the police about who stabbed him, implicating David. Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) is caught posing as his solicitor as he makes an attempt to try and talk him round but Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank) then makes an attempt to get Josh to do the right thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJosh isn\u2019t budging though and makes it clear that he is only interested in his own safety \u2013 he won\u2019t be taking back his statement. As Billy is left crushed at being so helpless, he confides in Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) about the situation and Paul decides that perhaps he can do something.\n\nAs a helpless Shona starts to accept that the wedding can\u2019t go ahead, fresh evidence comes to light which could exonerate David and see him released in time to say \u2018I do\u2019. Dare he and Shona hope that something might at last go right for them?\n\nAs the guests gather in the bistro, David faces a race against time and all Shona can do is hope that her husband to be will be home.\n\nOne to watch: Thursday 7th October at 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Can the Corrie couple make it?", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ShonaDavid0036a-90b7-e1571658608558_1571658715.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
