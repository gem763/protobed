The updated software works with Apple\u2019s new Music app, which replaced iTunes in Apple\u2019s latest desktop OS refresh, and libraries in Music can automatically load in the updated Serato DJ Pro and DJ Lite.\n\nAlong with updating its DJ software, Serato has also released a new version of its beat-making software Serato Studio that\u2019s supported in Catalina. However, not all Serato products are in the clear. Serato Sample and Pitch \u2019n Time Pro and LE are still not compatible with Catalina, but the company says it\u2019s actively working on updates. Additionally, Serato warns there is still some DJ hardware from partners that doesn\u2019t work with the new OS and the status on that is \u201cout of Serato\u2019s control.\u201d\n\nno need to manually export your music library\n\nUpgrading to Catalina has proved to be a pain for a lot of DJs who relied on iTunes as a part of their workflow. Many use it to organize their music into playlists and then automatically sync them with DJ apps using an XML feature, now no longer available, that shares the necessary database file with third-party apps.\n\nAccording to Apple, the new Music app removes support for automatically syncing playlists with third-party apps using XML. This has caused complications with DJ software that hadn\u2019t updated to support Apple\u2019s new method. XML files can still be manually extracted from Music, but it takes a bit more effort and results in a static file, meaning you have to export a new one every time you want to update a playlist.\n\nCatalina\u2019s Music app does support automatic library syncing with other apps, but some companies are still playing catch up to make sure their software supports the new method. Some apps, like Algoriddim\u2019s Djay, were already optimized for Catalina at launch, but others, like Rekordbox, have yet to release a compatible update.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re a Serato DJ Pro or DJ Lite user that has updated to Catalina, everything should work just fine, and your Music playlists will load automatically in the software with no need for manual exporting.", "description": "Music software company Serato has released new official versions of its DJ Pro and DJ Lite software that are fully supported in macOS Catalina.
