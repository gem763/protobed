He has owned a mansion in Cheyne Walk for many years, while Clapton lives in a Georgian terrace house near the church when he's not at his Surrey estate with his family.\n\nThe organ has been handmade by a team of master craftsmen at the Devon headquarters of William Drake Ltd, organ makers by appointment to the Queen. The firm has previously built organs for St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe organ will be christened at a series of concerts in the coming weeks \u2014 although it is not known if Jagger or Clapton will be in attendance.\n\nParishioner Rob McGibbon, who was part of the fundraising committee, said: 'It has been a huge effort by the local community to raise the money, but to get the support of Mick and Eric was a wonderful bonus.\n\n'We reached out to them and they both responded immediately and generously.

'Everyone was evacuated.'\n\nGuests at Theo Randall, breakfasting on roast organic pork sausage, mashed avocado and goats' curd on sourdough toast, were directed to the exits.\n\nIt is not known if the couple, who were believed to be members of Extinction Rebellion, paid for the meal. 'There was an Oil & Money conference at the hotel, so it was full of gas guzzlers,' adds my source.\n\nA hotel spokesman tells me: 'They caused quite a bit of chaos as everyone had to vacate the building, but luckily the issue was resolved and we weren't out of business for long.'\n\nDame Joan Collins says her granddaughter Miel \u2014 by daughter Tara Newley \u2014 is a chip off the old block when it comes to fending off unwanted male advances.\n\n'I think we have a long way to go still,' says Dame Joan, 'but I'm glad to see that younger women won't put up with any of that.\n\n'My granddaughter, who's 21, works in a restaurant.
