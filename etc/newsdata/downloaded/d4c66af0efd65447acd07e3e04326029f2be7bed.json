(Physician has topped the list since 2015, when Glassdoor began releasing the report.)\n\nAmanda Stansell, Glassdoor senior economic research analyst, tells MarketWatch that physician tops the list because it requires highly specialized skills and there is high demand for the jobs thanks in part to the high numbers of aging boomers.\n\nPhysician is just one of the many health care roles rounding out the top 10 \u2014 with pharmacy manager taking the No. 2 spot at $144,768 and dentist the No. 3 spot at $142,478. And if you\u2019re considering a job in the health care field, Stansell points out that nurse practitioners (who make $109,481 and land on the No. 11 spot on this list) have an extremely high number of job openings, which signals \u201ca strong need\u201d for these professionals in the health care field.\n\nGlassdoor\u2019s report looks at the annual median base salary of jobs (controlling for factors such as location and seniority) that have at least 100 salary reports on the site from U.S.-based employees in the past year; C-suite jobs are excluded.\n\n10 highest paying jobs in the U.S. for 2019:\n\n1. Physician: Median Base Salary: $193,415\n\n2. Pharmacy Manager: $144,768\n\n3. Dentist: $142,478\n\n4. Pharmacist: $126,438\n\n5. Enterprise Architect: $122,585\n\n6. Corporate Counsel: $117,588\n\n7. Software Engineering Manager: $114,163\n\n8. Physician Assistant: $113,855\n\n9. Corporate Controller: $113,368\n\n10. Software Development Manager: $109,809\n\nTech jobs also made a strong showing in the top 10, with enterprise architects (they help ensure that a company\u2019s IT systems align with its priorities and strategies) landing the No. 5 spot at $122,585 and software engineers at No. 7 with $114,163.\n\n\u201cA large contributor to this is the fierce fight for talent among tech companies,\u201d Stansell says. \u201cIn our healthy labor market, tech workers are in the driver\u2019s seat and companies have to offer competitive salaries.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s reflected in the fact that tech companies dominate the list of the highest-paying companies in America. Palo Alto Networks and NVIDIA both pay a median of more than $170,000 to workers, Glassdoor found, while Twitter and Google top $160,000.\n\n10 highest paying companies in the U.S. for 2019:\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks: Median Total Compensation: $170,929\n\n2. NVIDIA: $170,068\n\n3. Twitter: $162,852\n\n4. Gilead Sciences: $162,210\n\n5. Google: $161,254\n\n6. VMware: $158,063\n\n7. LinkedIn: $157,402\n\n8. Facebook: $152,962\n\n9. Salesforce: $150,379\n\n10. Microsoft: $148,068\n\nWhile many of these best-paying jobs in America, like doctor and dentist, require years of education beyond just a bachelor\u2019s degree, some \u2014 in particular some of the tech jobs \u2014 may not, Stansell points out. Indeed, some software engineering managers and software development managers simply get their experience through work experience, rather than needing an advanced degree, she adds.", "description": "Health care and tech jobs dominate the list of careers where you can make bank", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR477_doctor_ZG_20190917161049.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
