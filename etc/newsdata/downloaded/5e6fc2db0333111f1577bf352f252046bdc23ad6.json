Making products out of used aluminum is now a way for companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Apple to show a commitment to greening their manufacturing. Customers are supposed to be able to sleep a little better at night knowing that the shiny thing they bought did some good for the planet. But is aluminum\u2019s future as bright as the hype suggests?\n\nThe man formerly known as Aquaman sure thinks so. Jason Momoa announced in April that he\u2019s partnering with Ball Corporation to produce a line of canned water, called Mananalu. Saying goodbye to Aquaman and the other bearded characters he\u2019s played, the action star caused a buzz when he shaved off his beard on camera to promote aluminum as the cure to Earth\u2019s giant plastics problem. \u201cPlastics are killing our planet. And I think I have a solution,\u201d Momoa says in the video, clippers in hand. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that can really help our planet and save our planet, as long as we recycle, and that\u2019s aluminum.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not alone. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo announced this year that they\u2019re working to roll out water packaged in aluminum as part of their efforts to cut down on plastic waste. There\u2019s also the line of Liquid Death drinks that claims to \u201cmurder your thirst\u201d with mountain water in \u201ceco-friendly cans.\u201d\n\nNow THIS is how you sell water!

During this month\u2019s Apple event, the tech giant announced that its new iPads and Apple Watches would feature components fashioned from 100 percent recycled aluminum. The announcement builds on the commitment it made last year to make the enclosures of its MacBook Air and Mac mini out of the recycled material. \u201cWe\u2019re pioneering a future where we no longer need to mine precious materials from the Earth to make our products,\u201d Apple said in its 2019 environmental responsibility report.\n\nAluminum can be recycled indefinitely\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why so many companies fall for aluminum\u2019s environmental appeal. It can be recycled indefinitely. An aluminum can can become yet another aluminum can pretty much without losing anything in the process. Most food-grade plastics, in contrast, are \u201cdowncycled,\u201d their quality degrading each time they\u2019re rehashed.\n\nThe Aluminum Association, an industry group, says that almost 75 percent of all the aluminum ever produced to date is still in use today. On the other hand, only 9 percent of all plastics ever made have been recycled, according to a study published in the journal Science Advances in 2017. It found that 6.3 billion of the 8.3 billion metric tons of all the plastic ever made has become waste. What to do with all that plastic became an even bigger dilemma for the United States last year after China announced that it\u2019s no longer accepting low-grade plastics for recycling.\n\nRecycling aluminum saves about 90 percent of the energy it takes to make new aluminum, which is great since mining bauxite ore and turning it into aluminum is pretty environmentally destructive and energy-intensive. It takes about twice as much energy to produce new aluminum as it does to produce new plastic.\n\n\u201cThey could put water in solid gold containers (very easy to recycle), but that wouldn\u2019t be best, right?\u201d\n\nSo to reap the most environmental rewards of using aluminum, companies and individuals ought to make sure they\u2019re sinking their money into recycled aluminum, not virgin aluminum. It\u2019s unclear from PepsiCo\u2019s announcements whether it\u2019ll use new or rehashed aluminum in its new line of products. PepsiCo didn\u2019t immediately respond to The Verge to clarify. A spokesperson for Coca-Cola told The Verge in an email that its aluminum packaging \u201cwill be made of up to 70% recycled content.\u201d\n\nSwitching over to aluminum from plastic \u201cpartly solves one problem (less plastic) but creates a new problem (more aluminum),\u201d Thomas Kinnaman, a professor of economics at Bucknell University who researches global recycling trends, told The Verge in an email. \u201cThey could put water in solid gold containers (very easy to recycle), but that wouldn\u2019t be best, right?\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the question of cutting down waste versus just making a different type of litter. Humans are far from perfect, and while some of the new aluminum cans will get recycled, others could easily end up in the trash. The Aluminum Association says that each year, Americans send more than $700 million worth of aluminum cans to landfills. What if instead of buying either a plastic bottle or aluminum can to quench our thirst, we took a trip to the water fountain or refilled a reusable thermos?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no easy answer. Each \u2018solution\u2019 has its own challenges.\u201d\n\nWood Mackenzie, an energy research company, looked into the pros and cons of aluminum versus plastic to forecast what might win \u201cthe water bottle war.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no easy answer. Each \u2018solution\u2019 has its own challenges,\u201d it wrote in its initial findings. There hasn\u2019t been as much incentive to can water in the past because plastic is cheaper. The added cost of aluminum might have made more sense for pricier drinks like beer and soda that could also benefit from the added shelf life that canning provides. But the use of aluminum for beverage packaging has been on the decline as people started to turn to less sugary drinks over soda. Uday Patel, senior research manager at Wood Mackenzie, tells The Verge that this trend could change as a result of the bad reputation that plastic bottles seem to be getting. And the plastics industry, he believes, is \u201cconcerned.\u201d\n\nThe aluminum fad isn\u2019t just taking over the beverage industry. When it comes to electronics, Apple making its products with 100 percent recycled aluminum might set a promising precedent, but the net environmental benefits aren\u2019t totally clear yet.\n\nIn 2017, aluminum was responsible for about a quarter of the company\u2019s carbon footprint from manufacturing, according to its environmental responsibility report. The following year, the company said that it reduced emissions from aluminum in its products by 45 percent. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is, is quite difficult, quite complicated. And in many ways, I think they should be lauded for their use of recycled aluminum,\u201d says Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University who maps the international movement of electronic waste.\n\nthe net environmental benefits aren\u2019t totally clear\n\n\u201cThe actual nitty gritty of whether there\u2019s a genuine energy and material savings when it comes to Apple\u2019s processes is really difficult to say for sure\u201d based on the information they make public, Lepawsky tells The Verge. There may be added emissions from transportation, for example, that come from sourcing recycled aluminum. Lepawsky also points to a phenomenon called the Jevons paradox. In the 19th century, William Jevons found that increased efficiency in using coal for energy led to using more coal, not less of it. The same could happen for aluminum as its popularity rises, leading to not only more aluminum waste but potentially more mining for its raw materials as well.\n\nSo, the aluminum shift is complicated. It could pay off for the planet, but only if products made with recycled materials replace those made with new aluminum and plastics \u2014 and if consumers worry more about cutting down on their waste than they do about which type of bottle to buy. But perhaps the bright spot in considering these questions is that it puts the spotlight on all of those environmental impacts of manufacturing, versus focusing mostly on what happens at the end of a product\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cAll too often, the concern around the environmental impact of electronics focuses almost obsessively on what happens to consumer\u2019s devices after they supposedly throw them away,\u201d says Lepawsky. \u201cThe amount of pollution and waste that occurs on the manufacturing side of things is hugely larger than the weight of materials that consumers get rid of, in the aggregate, after they stop using their devices.\u201d\n\nCorrection: This sorry has been updated to reflect that Wood Mackenzie is an energy research company.
