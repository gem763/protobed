The rider of the motorcycle, 19-year-old Harry Dunn, was taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Oxford, where he died soon after, according to press releases from Northamptonshire Police.\n\nThe crash scene was less than a mile down the road from Royal Air Force Croughton, commonly known as RAF Croughton, which is a British military station that houses an intelligence-gathering base operated by the United States Air Force.\n\nOver the weekend, Northamptonshire Police superintendent Sarah Johnson revealed that a 42-year-old American woman who is \"being treated as a suspect\" in the investigation has left the nation after allegedly telling investigators she had no plans to do so. Police intended to arrest and formally interview the woman, who has not been officially named.\n\n\"Northamptonshire Police followed all of its usual procedures following the incident, including liaising closely with the suspect, who engaged fully with us at the time and had previously confirmed to us that she had no plans to leave the country in the near future,\" Johnson said in a statement Saturday. \"Due process was also followed in seeking the necessary documentation to allow for the arrest and formal interview of the suspect, and the force is now exploring all opportunities through diplomatic channels to ensure that the investigation continues to progress.\"\n\nNorthamptonshire Police are also \"working closely\" with the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office \"in an effort to come to a resolution regarding this matter,\" according to Johnson.\n\n\u201cHarry Dunn\u2019s family deserve justice,\" she added, \"and in order to achieve this, a full and thorough investigation, with the assistance of all parties involved, needs to take place.\"\n\nPHOTO: A general view of flowers left in remembrance of Harry Dunn on the B4031 near RAF Croughton on Oct. 7, 2019 near Brackley, England.
