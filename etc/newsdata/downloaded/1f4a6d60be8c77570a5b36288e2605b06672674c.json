If the government can help here, even better. But first it needs to do no harm.\u201d\n\nSpecial interest groups block innovation\n\nArmstrong also explained that \u201cinnovation often looks counter-intuitive and disruptive,\u201d but \u201cthe best first step is often just to stay out of the way.\u201d He also noted that governments are often influenced by special interest groups which \u201cwill play on fears and try to block innovation here.\u201d\n\nAs if echoing Armstrong\u2019s sentiment, payment processor PayPal has recently left the Libra Association, reportedly due to concerns over potentially excessive regulatory scrutiny that could follow.\n\nAt the same time, China\u2019s Central Bank has said \u2014 contradicting previous statements \u2014 that there is no specific launch date in mind for its digital currency.\n\nStill, as Cointelegraph reported on Sept. 27, Chinese Fintech Theme Index has risen over 50% in 2019, outperforming the broader market after the Chinese national digital currency was announced.", "description": "The U.S. government reacted to Facebook\u2019s Libra \u201clike they almost want to be left behind,\u201d says Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZDg3M2Y2YzJkYzY4N2U4YjlhZjYxNTM0ZjYwODliYmEuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
