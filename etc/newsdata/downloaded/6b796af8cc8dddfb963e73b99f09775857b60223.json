The basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president. We begin tonight with a series of admissions by the president that all but assures his impeachment in the House of Representatives. It\u2019s a moment of truth for Republicans and they\u2019ve been largely silent on what we\u2019ve seen from the president. Today, he publicly called on two foreign governments to interfere in the election by investigating his chief 2020 political rival\u2026\n\nWhat you just heard is a public admission of the allegations of the heart of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and at the heart of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. That the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump is using the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election while doing it relying on a debunked conspiracy theory or two.\n\nBy the way, this is not hearsay, this is not a leak, this is not a whistleblower complaint. It\u2019s not a memorandum of a phone conversation. You heard the president did it on the White House lawn. This moment should arguably be a national emergency. The Founding Fathers would have considered it a national emergency if the president publicly lobbied multiple foreign governments to interfere in the next election.", "description": "", "authors": ["Realclearpolitics.Com Video Chuck_Todd_A_National_Emergency_Is_Upon_Us_Democracy_Under_Attack_From_Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
