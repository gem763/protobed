I absolutely love my stairs.\"\n\nAnd since revealing her work of art, the mum from Gloucestershire's post has amassed more than 18,000 likes and 1,600 comments from fans desperate to replicate the look in their own homes.\n\n(Image: MirrorPix)\n\n(Image: MirrorPix)\n\n(Image: MirrorPix)\n\nOne group member, Lana, wrote: \"Love this. I've got the same wall paper as my feature wall in my bedroom - absolutely love it.\"\n\nAnother responded: \"Omg this is so beautiful, perfect how you got the match like right on! Love it x.\"\n\nSpeaking to Mirror Money, Emma has now revealed the secrets to her bargain renovation.\n\nAnd it's all to do with a \u00a313.99 roll of wallpaper that you can buy on eBay.\n\nHave you got any home renovation secrets to share?

I used some mod podge over the paper on the steps to keep it safe from the kids - I have eight children altogether,\" she said.\n\n\"In total, I would say it cost me no more than \u00a340, the wallpaper was from eBay for \u00a310.49 a roll - I used two in total, including one along with the satinwood.\n\n\"Altogether it took me six weeks to do though as I didn't have work,\" Emma, who works as a cleaner at a local school, said.\n\n\"It's not completely finished yet as we are waiting for some fallen tree branches to dry out to become the handrail,\" the creative mum added.\n\n\"I also need to add the finishing touches of photos to the walls.\n\n(Image: MirrorPix)\n\n(Image: MirrorPix)\n\n\"The gate is just an old one that we got from Facebook for free. We upcycled it and fitted it to the stairs, much better than a child's safety gate,\" she explained.\n\nAs for the basket - she said she picked it up for just \u00a32 at a local car boot.\n\n\"Looks great. Where did you get the basket from?\" one interested member of the group asked - to which Emma replied, \"a car boot, \u00a32 total bargain\".\n\nResponding to the incredible response on the back of her post, Emma said she's been left \"overwhelmed\".\n\n\"Thank you everyone! I am completely shocked and overwhelmed with the number of likes and comments!,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen this many likes on a post before.\"", "description": "Thrifty mum of eight Emma took matters into her own hands, using finds from her local car boot sale and online wallpaper to give her staircase a new lease of life", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708546.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bargain-loving-mum-transforms-her-stairs-for-just-\u00a330-using-simple-trick.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
