Duvall finds the victim, a college student named Amber, processing in the stairwell of her apartment building in Golden, Colorado, one morning in 2011. Duvall already knows the outline of the crime \u2013 breaking and entering, a rape that lasted for hours \u2013 but she starts at the beginning, smoothly guiding Amber through an interview step by step, checking her comfort level with each question. Her voice is disarming and pillowy, couching sentences with \u201cif it\u2019s all right with you\u201d, \u201cif you\u2019re comfortable\u201d and \u201ctake your time\u201d. Yet she builds a case, detail by detail. When she visits Amber at the hospital after her physical exam, she requests the nurse on duty to \u201cask her if she wants me to come in, but make it clear that if she doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s absolutely fine.\u201d Then she immediately calls the station to block off conference room three for her investigation.\n\nUnbelievable review \u2013 grimly credible story of trauma, power and injustice Read more\n\nIn other words: she does good work. The whole episode is a portrait in how things should be \u2013 how serious sexual assault cases should be taken, how crucial it is to listen to victims, how memory lapses and scattered details should be considered part and parcel of trauma memory, not a strike against it. It just so happens in this case, what should be is also what was \u2013 the episode, written by Susannah Grant, the series co-creator with Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, is based on the true story outlined in An Unbelievable Story of Rape, a 2015 article by T Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong co-published by ProPublica and the Marshall Project. Karen Duvall is inspired by the real detective Stacy Galbraith, also of Golden, who said in the article that her one rule of investigations is to \u201clisten and verify\u201d.\n\nIn the show, as in real life, Duvall/Galbraith and the detective Grace Rasmussen (based on the real Edna Hendershot) of neighboring Westminster, Colorado, partner up to pursue what they soon realize is a serial rapist evading justice, in part, by exploiting the police\u2019s lack of communication between departments, especially on cold rape cases. Their process is diligent \u2013 late nights, meticulous lists of all cars captured in one recovered security video, data sets on data sets \u2013 and crackling, in the way watching two people consistently level each other up can be; inspiring, in their empathy and doggedness; refreshing, in a way more visceral than intellectual \u2013 it holds my frustratingly short attention span, without draining it.\n\nThis part of the show transcends so-called \u201ccompetence porn\u201d (as in, the thrill of watching talented, smart people work together to solve problems) in part because it acts as the corrective to its other, far more brutal half. Duvall and Rasmussen aren\u2019t even introduced until the second episode; the first belongs to Marie Adler (Kaitlyn Dever), an 18-year-old on the brink of self-sufficiency after a string of foster homes when she calls 911 in Lynwood, Washington, in August 2008. She reports an hours-long rape by a masked stranger, but the police take the opposite tack than Duvall. They elevate minor inconsistencies in Marie\u2019s story into major discrepancies, play her precarious housing situation as leverage, corner her \u2013 both in practice and Lisa Cholodenko\u2019s camera \u2013 into vertiginous doubt. She fearfully recants, and is charged with false reporting.\n\nMarie\u2019s report and its aftermath splices Duvall and Rasmussen\u2019s investigation of eerily similar rapes three years later, though neither know it. The stories are two sides of the same coin \u2013 on one, the system failing; on the other, the system working \u2013 and listening \u2013 as it should. It illustrates two truths at the same time: law enforcement fails victims routinely, banally, devastatingly; there are also good actors who do the work. Unbelievable balances the two without veering into the salacious or exploitative \u2013 the assaults cast in brief memory flashes rather than scenes \u2013 or outrage-inducing. There\u2019s certainly a place for outrage \u2013 Roll Red Roll, a documentary about the Steubenville, Ohio, high school gang rape from a year after the events in Unbelievable, and Chanel Miller\u2019s upcoming book Know My Name, on the Brock Turner case, remind us that there are shockingly few consequences for assailants deemed \u201cpromising\u201d or when a shard of doubt on the victim\u2019s credibility can paint an assault as \u201cgrey area\u201d.\n\nBut Unbelievable doesn\u2019t focus on opposition, on uncovering incompetence or bad attitudes in law enforcement or the community. It takes as a given what most of its likely audience already knows: that these obstacles exist, that they must be known and considered, that the conversation moving forward starts from here. Instead, the focus is on getting the job done \u2013 in this case, finding and locking up the serial rapist, giving the victims space and recognition to heal, unwittingly correcting the devastating mistake on Marie\u2019s record three years before.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kaitlyn Dever in Unbelievable.

I\u2019m usually drawn to the self-sabotaging or self-negating \u2013 Amy Adams careening through a vodka-soaked and glaringly unethical journalism venture in Sharp Objects, or the melancholic True Detectives. I enjoy the quick hits of resolution in episodic procedurals such as Law & Order SVU, in which the victims usually have crazy backstories and, at most, a few scenes in an episode or two. But there\u2019s something refreshing about seeing two women do their job free of dramatic embellishment \u2013 tackle their case and then go home to their families, to complicated yet stable marriages.\n\nIt helps that Unbelievable boasts a next-level cast given several episodes to grow. If Dever didn\u2019t already arrive with her scene-stealing turn in Booksmart, then she\u2019s here now as Marie. Wever can convey more feeling with a head-tilt and a \u201chmm\u201d than many could do with a whole monologue. And Collette fills Rasmussen\u2019s steely, guy\u2019s gal shell with a visceral sense of responsibility and faith in her work.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s that disciplined responsibility that floored me, that made Unbelievable so watchable, despite its grim subject. The unveiling of #MeToo stories the past few years have pummeled me, taught me to mostly doubt justice, to sometimes value trauma as the most publicly interesting and formative thing about women; given this, to see two female detectives do their work well, grind on the job and struggle with the usual work/life balance confounds expectations. Listen. Verify.\n\nBack at the hospital in Colorado, Duvall reassures: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain any of your decisions to me,\u201d she says when Amber tries to justify why she hasn\u2019t called anyone \u2013 a concern clearly rooted in the knowledge that reporting sexual assault and harassment almost always means reporting on your credibility, too.\n\nLater, Duvall walks Amber to a friend\u2019s apartment, gives her number, says she\u2019ll be in touch. She lingers a moment at the closed door, pondering, soaking it in. Then she gets back to work.", "description": "The series, focused on two rape investigations - one gone awry, one dogged and empathetic - shows the refreshing power of depicting hard, sensitive work", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948fd323ebf4ceac2d8d6fa581bf31edaefe70e9/0_52_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13f55f0076a075f9467984910d8367c1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
