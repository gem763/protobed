All three phones are available to order starting September 13 ahead of their official launch on September 20.\n\nThe cameras on Apple\u2019s newly launched iPhones are undoubtedly the main attraction. The $700 iPhone 11 features a two-lens camera setup, while the pricier $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro and $1,100 Pro Max include triple-lens cameras.\n\nI spent a few minutes with Apple\u2019s new iPhones after the company\u2019s press event. Here\u2019s a brief look at the features and characteristics that stood out to me the most.\n\nThe camera is going to be the main reason people buy these phones.\n\nsource Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider\n\nThe iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max bring improvements when it comes to general performance, battery life, and durability.\n\nBut it\u2019s the camera that really stands out.\n\nBoth phones come with a slew of new photography-oriented features, like a new 120-degree ultrawide camera that can capture wider scenes, Night Mode for taking better photos in the dark, slow-motion video capture for selfies, and Deep Fusion, which processes photos pixel by pixel. That feature is coming later this fall.\n\nThe camera is a noticeable part of the design too.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nIf you\u2019re ever having trouble spotting the difference between an iPhone XS and an iPhone 11, the camera sensors will be a dead giveaway. All of Apple\u2019s iPhones have a larger new cutout for the camera sensor that resembles a square with rounded edges. The camera lenses themselves are also larger than the ones on Apple\u2019s previous-generation iPhones.\n\nMake no mistake: The camera is more noticeable on the iPhone 11 lineup than on any other iPhone, or perhaps any smartphone I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s definitely a departure from Apple\u2019s usually sleek and minimalist style. But it also screams that this phone is known for its cameras, which is also probably exactly what Apple wants.\n\nThe usefulness behind Apple\u2019s new ultrawide lens isn\u2019t just about the camera but also the software that goes with it.\n\nsource Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider\n\nDuring my time using Apple\u2019s new iPhones, it was the tiny details in Apple\u2019s camera software that impressed me the most.\n\nThe camera will automatically switch to its ultrawide-angle camera if the phone is tilted from portrait to landscape mode, for example. That\u2019s because the software assumes that you\u2019re probably trying to capture a wider shot, since you changed the phone\u2019s orientation. In my experience, this worked just about instantly, with no noticeable lag.\n\nThe iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max also come with a new feature that lets you switch between camera and video mode just by holding down the shutter button. But when you do this, you\u2019ll notice that a tiny lock symbol appears to the right of the button, signaling that you should slide the button over to keep recording.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle software flourish that feels classically Apple. It\u2019s reminiscent of the way the slide-to-unlock logo on the iPhone\u2019s old lock screen used to illuminate in the same direction in which you needed to swipe to unlock the phone, guiding you along the way.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s new matte finish will probably make it easier to use your phone without a case.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max also come with a new matte finish in four colors: a new midnight green, space gray, gold, and silver.\n\nThe matte finish represents a noticeable shift from the glossy backs on Apple\u2019s iPhone XS family of smartphones. The new texture makes it easier to grip the phone, which could prevent accidental drops, and the matte look also seems like it would be less susceptible to fingerprint smudges. That could make the iPhone 11 Pro all the more tempting to use without a case, especially considering Apple says these phones have the toughest glass ever in a smartphone.\n\nBut at the same time, the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max are also a bit heavier than their predecessors, and you can certainly tell.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s screen is brighter, and it\u2019s immediately noticeable.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max\u2019s screen can reach 800 nits at max brightness, while the iPhone XS Max\u2019s display reaches only 625 nits. Those may just sound like arbitrary numbers to many people, but when you look at the two phones side by side, it becomes very noticeable. The iPhone 11 Pro Max\u2019s screen looked much brighter and punchier alongside my iPhone XS Max, which will likely make the 11 Pro Max\u2019s screen easier to view in sunny outdoor conditions.\n\nThe iPhone 11\u2019s colors will be a big draw for many people.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nLike the iPhone XR, Apple\u2019s new iPhone 11 comes in a variety of colorful choices, including purple, yellow, green, black, white, and Product Red.\n\nBut unlike the iPhone XR, the iPhone 11\u2019s colors feel more pastellike, particularly the new purple and green choices. The finish is also glossy, unlike the iPhone 11 Pro, once again echoing the iPhone XR.\n\nIt feels like Apple learned a lot from the iPhone XR and used that to inspire the iPhone 11.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nIt feels like Apple is positioning the iPhone 11 as the new flagship iPhone and the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max as the professional-grade models geared toward power users. And given the iPhone 11\u2019s $700 price point and colorful design, there\u2019s no doubt that it feels like a successor to the iPhone XR.\n\nThat indicates Apple has learned a lot from the iPhone XR\u2019s success. For example, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners reported that nearly half of Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in the third quarter of 2019 were from the iPhone XR. That\u2019s even despite the fact that Apple was widely expected to launch new iPhones following its third quarter.\n\nWith the iPhone 11, it feels like Apple is leaning into the characteristics that made the iPhone XR successful: offering important features like a decent camera, an all-screen design, and long battery life at an affordable price point.\n\nInstead of positioning this as a low-cost version of the flagship iPhone, it feels like this is the flagship iPhone. The Pro models, meanwhile, seem to be geared toward people that use their phones for professional photography and need longer battery life and a better OLED screen.\n\nNow tell us what you think!", "description": "Business Insider - Apple just announced its new iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max.
