From bridal suits to groups of bridesmen, nothing is off the table when it comes to celebrating the big day except, of course, stringent rules.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cFor 2020, couples will seek to create unique days, or even weekends, which truly reflect them as people,\u201d says venue styling and prop hire company This Will Be Forever. \u201cThis extends across every aspect from food to the dress, decor and even entertainment.\u201d\n\nSo what are the biggest trends due to take hold next year? From wedding planners and makeup artists to caterers and dress designers, The Independent spoke to some of the leading experts in the world of weddings to reveal the nuptial mood for 2020.\n\nThe wedding dress\n\nWhile many women dream of wearing a big white gown on their wedding day, for some it can feel a little too restrictive a choice.\n\nLuckily, wedding dress trends for 2020 mean that brides-to-be can get the best of both worlds, with designs that fit the bill while allowing the wearer to express their own personal style.\n\nAccording to Gemma Green, company director of bridal boutique Bow\u2019s Bride, the boho trend that reigned supreme in 2019 weddings is going nowhere.\n\n\u201cAs we all know wedding dress trends come and go but we have seen so much love for the boho look this year and we feel this will continue into 2020,\u201d Green says.\n\nFor others, Green expects more dramatic styles to come to the fore next year.\n\n\u201cStyles like ruffles, fringing, pearls, earthy colours and sleeves will be everywhere. We are definitely finding less of a demand for the traditional wedding dress, with a carefree, romantic look.\u201d\n\nThis shift towards more contemporary silhouettes is felt across the board, with London-based fashion label Ghost extolling the virtues of gowns which carry subtle nods to of-the-moment fashion trends.\n\n\u201cThe key details for dresses are statement necklines and attention to sleeve details,\u201d says Sameera Azeem, creative director of Ghost.\n\n\u201cThis could be the Bardot necklines and long or puff sleeves, much like the current ready-to-wear trends.\u201d\n\nAzeem adds that bridal tailoring is also on the rise with many modern brides opting for trouser suits and jumpsuits instead of traditional gowns.\n\nFor wedding dress designer Catherine Deane, one of the biggest shifts in trends for next year will be colour, with more and more brides opting for softer hues and metallic finishes.\n\n\u201cSpring/Summer 2020 is going to be an exciting time for Bridal,\u201d Deane says.\n\n\u201cExpect combinations of metallic and glitter detailing added to sheer fabrics, which will have more of a subtle sultriness than the traditional sweetness associated with a little sparkle\u201d.\n\nHair and makeup\n\nYour wedding day is likely to be the most photographed day of your life and while it can be tempting to go for a bold new look, renowned makeup artist (MUA) Nicola Chapman Haste insists that bridal makeup should never follow trends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about you being the best version of yourself,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf your signature look is a red lip, go for a red lip but if you have never worn one before and are thinking about wearing it on your wedding day, I wouldn\u2019t. Your wedding day is not the time to test out something new.\u201d\n\nBridal hair and makeup artist Gemma Sutton agrees, adding that the styles you choose should \u201cenhance your natural beauty rather than masking it\u201d.\n\nBoth MUAs suggest starting early with skin prep to get the most out of your bridal look, while Sutton reveals that many of her 2020 brides have been opting for looks that consists of natural, dewy skin and deep pink lips.\n\nWhen it comes to hair, accessories are a key component with celebrity hair stylist Larry King encouraging 2020 brides to \u201cthink out the box\u201d.\n\nThe salon owner created a number of hair looks for the latest Ralph & Russo Couture show, which included intricate braiding, soft finishes and entwined strings of pearls.\n\nSimilarly, King also created a total of five different hair looks for fashion blogger Victoria McGrath, aka inthefrow, to complement each of her different outfits at her wedding earlier this year, including a swishy power dressing ponytail and 50\u2019s-inspired beehive.\n\nThe National Wedding Show agrees, adding that a number of its makeup and hair exhibitors have showcased everything from diamante-filled fishtail plaits and glittering hair vines.\n\nFood and drink\n\nOne of the biggest wedding menu trends set to skyrocket next year is the concept of grazing tables, says Hattie Mauleverer, founder of luxury boutique catering company Top Hat.\n\n\u201cThe painful process of table planning could well become something of the past, as grazing tables are now the 'in' way to dine at weddings,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cGrazing tables are areas filled with a mix of sweet and savoury snack options, to encourage your guests to come back for more.\u201d\n\nMauleverer adds that more and more couples are also turning to sustainable options with the trend for environmentally friendly living trickling down into weddings.\n\n\u201cFrom recycled paper for the invitations, to the sourcing of the lamb for your main course, caterers are increasingly being more and more challenged to source local and organic produce for their ingredients as well as coming up with innovative ways to utilise \u2018ugly\u2019 veg and anything from fish skin to chicken bones.\u201d\n\nAlex Head, the founder of Social Pantry, a London-based catering company that has fed everyone from Gigi Hadid to Hillary Clinton, agrees, adding that \u201cfarm to table\u201d food is fast-becoming a staple for contemporary nuptials.\n\n\u201cClients are increasingly asking us to create menus that include home grown produce from their parents\u2019 gardens, their own products and to support nearby farms and their favourite local suppliers when designing menus,\u201d Head says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got three weddings next year that are using home-grown produce, these include using home-grown vegetables for chutneys, sourcing summer berries locally, a \u2018Sussex Cheese board\u2019 and for one wedding we are even curing locally sourced salmon in family-made Limoncello!\"\n\nThe d\u00e9cor\n\nThe endeavour to remain as sustainable as possible doesn\u2019t have to end with your celebratory feast.\n\nAccording to This Will Be Forever, couples are choosing statement d\u00e9cor pieces for their wedding which they can go on to repurpose for their homes afterwards.\n\n\u201cNeon lights and bold signs will be huge in 2020, particularly with hand painted typography and patterns,\u201d the company says.\n\n\u201cThis extends onto flowers, with dried flowers becoming increasingly popular and being used throughout the decor, bouquets and even in hair pieces.\u201d\n\nLeah Stageman, founder of Boho & Bloom Prop Hire, agrees, adding that an increasing fascination with 1970s bohemia has championed the return of sustainable, locally grown wild flowers and dramatic dried offerings.\n\n\u201cDried palms, pampas plumes and unusual grasses will be used to create lush bohemian backdrops and wild bouquets,\u201d Stageman predicts.\n\n\u201cFrom vibrant wedding stationery and disco balls to retro peacock chairs and macrame, the 70s are back.\u201d\n\nWedding planner Helaina Storey has also witnessed a growing trend for nearly-weds opting for dry hire venue options for complete flexibility and a blank canvas.\n\nShe explains that the appeal lies in couples having the ability to put their own individual stamp on their big day.\n\n\u201cWe are also noticing a rise in weddings taking place at couples\u2019 family homes when the space allows, and expect this to continue through 2020 and beyond,\u201d Storey says.\n\nThe bridesmaids\n\nThe way you choose to dress your bridal party has evolved, with many modern brides choosing to eschew matchy-matchy pastel looks for outfits that incorporate their friends\u2019 personalities into their big day.\n\nFrances Cookson and Katie Arnott, co-founders of fashion label Rewritten London, say that it is important to remember that bridesmaid dresses are \u201cdefinitely not one style suits all\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur brides come to us because they want a modern, mismatched look with 99 per cent of our bridal parties combining dresses, jumpsuits and separates,\u201d says Cookson and Arnott.\n\n\u201cBrides are getting bolder in their colour choices too. We are seeing vivid coral getting more and more attention and our Soho jumpsuit that launched in Spring has since become a best-seller.\u201d\n\nAzeem agrees, adding that bridesmaids no longer feel the need to wear one uniform colour or style.\n\n\u201cThere has been a shift and it is now more about mix and match styles in contrasting colours and shapes,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThis trend is much more personal and allows each individual to express their personality.\u201d\n\nAzeem adds that Ghost designs its range of bridesmaid dresses so that they have dual purpose, meaning they can be worn again after the wedding.\n\n\u201cWeddings are expensive and so we as a brand have reduced our retail price points on our occasion wear collections,\u201d Azeem says.\n\n\u201cOur collections also have more of a nod to our ready-to-wear ranges, so they less formal and more wearable.\u201d", "description": "In an age of aspirational Instagram\u00a0feeds and Pinterest\u00a0boards, betrothed couples today are faced with an overwhelming amount of choice when it comes to starting to plan their big day.\u00a0 In recent years, cookie cutter traditions are increasingly being replaced with personal touches that represent the couple about to exchange their \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/15/tropical-wedding.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
