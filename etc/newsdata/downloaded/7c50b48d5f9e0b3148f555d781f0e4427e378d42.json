Toyota and Kimura declined comment on the issue Tuesday.\n\nGhosn meanwhile is out on bail in Tokyo, awaiting a trial that reports have suggested could start next April on charges of under-reporting millions of dollars in salary and of using company funds for personal expenses.\n\nHe denies any wrongdoing.", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Crisis-hit Japanese automaker Nissan on Tuesday named Makoto Uchida as new chief executive, elevating the insider currently", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/42b6ad_nissan-motor-chairman-yasushi-kimura-left-chairman-nomination-committee-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
