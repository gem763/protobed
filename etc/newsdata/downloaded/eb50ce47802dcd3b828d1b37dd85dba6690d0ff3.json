Most often, I find myself agreeing with the arguments presented in his twice-weekly columns for The Washington Post. When I don\u2019t, I have to wrack my brains to figure out why, and how I might frame a cogent dissent.\n\nHe\u2019s recently published \u201cThe Conservative Sensibility\u201d \u2014 no subtitle \u2014 a 538-page reflection on Western political philosophy and tradition, and the specifically American vision of the Founders.\n\n\u201cA sensibility,\u201d he writes, \u201cis more than an attitude but less than an agenda.\u201d The American conservative sensibility, he adds, includes \u201can unsentimental, almost bleak realism,\u201d while applying \u201cgeneral principles to untidy realities.\u201d\n\nAmerican conservatives in the current era, he argues, have no higher obligation than to defend the \u201cclassical liberal tradition\u201d upon which the United States was founded. For more than a century, that tradition has been under attack by progressivism which \u201cbegan as a forthright rejection of the Founders\u2019 philosophy.\u201d Today\u2019s progressives seek nothing less than \u201cthe overthrow of the Founders\u2019 classical liberalism.\u201d\n\nOf the 10 chapters in this volume, all worth reading, only one grapples with foreign policy. But that single chapter is packed with ideas, a few of which I\u2019ll attempt to unpack here.\n\nMr. Will, who received a Ph.D. is from Princeton decades before America\u2019s elite universities were debased by political correctness, begins by suggesting that in \u201cforeign policy, as elsewhere, one of conservatism\u2019s functions is to say things that people do not want to hear, such as this: War, which has always been part of the human story, always will be.\u201d More than that: \u201cHistory is, to a significant extent, a story of hostilities between groups \u2014 tribes, clans, cities, nations.\u201d\n\nWoodrow Wilson, the most consequential progressive president (so far), rejected this reality, believing that peace conferences, transnational organizations and \u201cthe power of understanding\u201d could end wars once and for all. This approach led to the League of Nations, a failed experiment as everyone knows, and the United Nations, a no less a failed experiment as everyone should know.\n\nThe fiction that there is a \u201ccommunity of nations\u201d underlies these failures. \u201cNothing can be properly called a \u2018community\u2019 if it jumbles together entities as different as Saudi Arabia, and New Zealand, Japan and Sudan, Italy and Iran, Norway and North Korea,\u201d Mr. Will points out. \u201cThe phrase \u2018community of nations\u2019 may seem harmless, if hackneyed, but it is a symptom of a blinding sentimentality.\u201d\n\nHe tells the story, perhaps apocryphal, of President Wilson asking Georges Clemenceau if all men are not brothers. The French statesman\u2019s reply: \u201cYes, all men are brothers \u2014 Cain and Abel! Cain and Abel!\u201d\n\nThe most disastrous political calamities of the past 100 years, Mr. Will notes, have been tied to the progressive belief that both nations and human nature \u201care much more malleable than they actually are.\u201d More than 100 million people have been killed due to \u201cambitious attempts at social engineering-attempts to create racial purity or a classless society or the New Soviet Man.\u201d\n\nMost Americans, he writes, are \u201cnatural\u201d isolationists, which is to say that they prefer \u201cto think as little as possible about the rest of the world.\u201d But most also believe \u201cthat the nation does have some sort of mission.\u201d\n\nIn particular, there is the Founders\u2019 belief in natural rights, meaning rights that governments do not create but \u2014 if they are good governments \u2014 do secure for their citizens. This leads to his assertion that the Declaration of Independence\u2019s \u201cdeclaration that rights, being natural, are universal must in some way inform this nation\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Will favorably quotes John Quincy Adams\u2019 admonition that America \u201cgoes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy,\u201d he recognizes that in the present era \u2014 an era in which the Atlantic and Pacific no longer function as moats safeguarding the castle \u2014 it is necessary \u201cto make prudent departures from Adams\u2019 ideal.\u201d\n\nOf course, prudence is in the eye of the beholder. As Mr. Will sees it, liberating Iraq from Saddam Hussein\u2019s clutches was not prudent. Making clear that the United States will not abandon Taiwan to China\u2019s tender mercies would be.\n\n\u201cU.S. practices should respond to Beijing\u2019s pressure on Taiwan with a reciprocal defiance worthy of a great nation friendly to a small nation that has few friends,\u201d he wrote in a column last month.\n\nSupporting democrats abroad should not be confused with exporting democracy abroad, also known as nation-building, a task requiring skills Americans haven\u2019t mastered, and based on this faulty premise: \u201cIf everyone yearns for freedom, and freedom is understood identically everywhere, how hard can building a democratic nation be?\u201d\n\nThe truth, Mr. Will writes \u2014 political incorrectness alert! \u2014 is that \u201csome cultures lack the requisite aptitudes for democracy.\u201d A democratic society \u201crequires talents and aptitudes that do not appear spontaneously, and are not distributed democratically, meaning evenly, across the globe.\u201d\n\nDoes that imply that Americans should turn a blind eye and a cold shoulder to such cultures?\n\nNo. His argument instead is that U.S. foreign policy should \u201ccreate incentives for the slow, incremental modification of certain national characters to bring them more into conformity with the universalism of the American creed. Pressure can come from the United States by the constant support \u2014 rhetorical, financial, diplomatic \u2014 of people in those countries who are asserting natural rights that have been denied recognition.\u201d\n\nDo you disagree? If so, I suspect you\u2019ll need to wrack your brains to figure why, and to frame a cogent dissent. I\u2019ll be eager to hear what you come up with.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
