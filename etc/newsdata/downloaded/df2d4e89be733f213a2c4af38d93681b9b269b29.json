If you want to watch the talent pack into the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, CA, the pre-show coverage on the red carpet begins an hour earlier, at 7PM ET (4PM PT).\n\nWill your favorite TV shows, actors, and writers take home an award? In order to be the first to find out, you\u2019ll have to watch along. For everything you want to know about the Emmys, we\u2019ll get into it below.\n\nWho\u2019s hosting the Emmys?\n\nTechnically, there will be no hosts. But, there will be a slate of previous Emmy Award-winning actors, and currently nominated actors, presenting awards throughout the three-hour show.\n\nTo name a few, Jon Hamm, Cherry Jones, James Corden, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jharrel Jerome, Bradley Whitford, Marisa Tomei, Hugh Laurie, and many more will make an appearance.\n\nHow do I watch the Emmys?\n\nThis year, Fox will broadcast the Emmys. So, you can watch the show on your local Fox affiliate channel, which is channel 5 in NYC or channel 11 in Los Angeles. Fox has a handy sheet containing all of its affiliates, in case you\u2019re not sure which channel it\u2019s on in your region.\n\nAs we say each year, and with each event that\u2019s broadcasted on TV, this stream will be the closest to being in real-time with the event. So, if you\u2019re worried about seeing spoilers on Twitter or Facebook before you see things unfold, watch the Emmys on your TV.\n\nIf you\u2019re a cable subscriber with credentials handy, the Fox Now app for all major streaming devices (Chromecast, Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV) is another option you have for easily tuning into the show.\n\nHow do I watch it online, and without paying?\n\nThere are plenty of options for watching the Emmys if you don\u2019t have a cable subscription. Whether you want to watch on your internet browser, or through a streaming device (Apple TV, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, Roku) connected to your television, here are a few suggestions.\n\nAlso, all of the services below are paid cable streaming services, but they offer free trials. So, unless you want to keep your subscription, just remember to cancel before the trial ends so you don\u2019t get charged.\n\nIf you live outside of the US, Fox has put together a list of providers that will be broadcasting the Emmys.\n\nWho\u2019s up to win an award?\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a fun night, and hopefully, there will be a few surprises.\n\nStreaming services continue to grow, and they continue to increase their presence on the list of nominees. HBO, in total, has 137 nominations, 32 nominations of which are for Game of Thrones alone. That beats the previous record set by NYPD Blue in 1994 by six nominations. Barry and Chernobyl have quite a few nominations of their own: 17 and 19, respectively.\n\nNetflix isn\u2019t far behind with 117 nominations, but it drops off from there in terms of services and networks. NBC has 58 nominations, while Amazon Prime Video has 47.\n\nHere is the full list of nominees:\n\nOUTSTANDING DRAMA\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nBodyguard\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nKilling Eve\n\nOzark\n\nPose\n\nSuccession\n\nThis Is Us\n\nLEAD ACTOR IN A DRAMA\n\nJason Bateman, Ozark\n\nSterling K.
