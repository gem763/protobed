They'll all whinge online and be abusive and they you ask, 'Did you vote?'\n\n\"[They say] 'Oh no, I didn't vote.' So if you're that worried about it, vote.\"\n\nDespite his strong words, he hinted that Catherine's departure wasn't something he relished.\n\nCraig lamented earlier: \"You know generally when you get down to this stage because people are very equal in talent and ability, you know?\n\n\"At the moment I think on Strictly it's becoming obvious that there are people that are really becoming fantastic and they're leaving some of the rest behind so it's quite split in that way.\n\n\"But we do always get the dilemma of two really good ones being in the bottom two.\"\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nJamie was straight to the point with Craig, asking: \"Do you think that the worst dancer was eliminated?\"\n\n\"I don't think that's the question,\" sharp-tongued Craig shot back.\n\n\"That was my question,\" said Jamie.\n\nCraig, readying up for a rant, brushed aside Jamie's query.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nHe said: \"It might be your question but it's not actually the question.\n\n\"For us, the judges, we have to judge the dance-off only, not what happened previously or what is to come, and you can only judge what you see in that one minute thirty.\n\n\"In my opinion, Mike had the cleaner dance. It's quite simple and you know, if it was another day or if Catherine was doing a Rumba, for instance, against his Tango, then she would have won it.\n\n\"But, you know, it's what happens on the day.\"\n\nAfter Dev and Dianne's departure from the show, the judges faced disgusting threats and abuse from online trolls.\n\nHead judge Shirley Ballas detailed on The Jonathan Ross Show a death threat she had received including a doctored image of her digging her own grave.", "description": "Craig was chatting with Amanda Holden and Jamie Theakston about the controversial axing when he blamed the people who didn't vote for her leaving the show", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Pa", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741569.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_CRAIG-REVEL-HORWOOD-DISCUSSES-LAST-NIGHTS-EVICTION-AND-BLAMES-THE-VIEWERS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
