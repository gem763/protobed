Braun Strowman is a massive guy. What happens if the cut reopens? What happens if you get injured shoulders or legs or whatever?'\n\n'If we lived our lives on \u2018what if\u2019 we would never do anything in our lives.\n\n'I think you gotta take the bull by the horns and get up there and enjoy it because, like I say, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.'\n\nFury tried to go after his arch rival but hobbled as a result of his apparent ankle injury\n\nWhile Warren is less than impressed, former WWE star and executive of the company, Triple H, has been taken aback by the 31-year-old British boxer's skills as a pro wrestler.\n\nSpeaking to ESPN, he said: 'He is a showman first and foremost, and it's really what he does.\n\n'But it's not an act; it's not a show. It's just who he is. He's charisma. He's the X-factor. He walks into a room, and you look at him.\n\nThe rivalry between the pair has intensified this month and they will fight in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe Gypsy King was a surprise guest ringsideat Smackdown and was called out by Strowman\n\nFury demanded an apology at Monday Night Raw but things escalated out of control\n\nThe following week, the pair signed a contract to end their feud in Saudi Arabia in Crown Jewel\n\n'He is the guy that your eyes are attracted to from a standpoint of just who he is. So [in] that aspect of it, he's custom-built for us.\n\n'I was blown away. I sent Vince (McMahon) a video of him about 45 minutes after the first day he was at the Performance Centre, and I said, \"You're not going to believe this, look at what he's already doing.\"\n\n'He picks it up so quickly because he's so laser-focused on it. He wants to put on this epic show.'", "description": "Tyson Fury took a heavy blow to the ankle (right) in training from arch rival Braun Strowman (left) ahead of the pair's highly-anticipated grudge fight in Saudi Arabia at the end of the month.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/09/20074974-0-image-a-4_1571820825461.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
