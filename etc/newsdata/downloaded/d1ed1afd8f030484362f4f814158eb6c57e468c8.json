We have.", "language": "en", "text": "What the NBA\u2019s demoralized boosters have largely overlooked, however, is a critical truth about its reinvention: Its liberal attitude isn\u2019t just good for its fans\u2019 consciences, it\u2019s good for business.\n\nThe sports world, or at least the NBA, hasn\u2019t changed its fundamental motive: profit. We\u2019ve changed in what we demand as consumers. Over the past decade, Americans have come to expect an unprecedented level of political transparency from our entertainment, whether it\u2019s the endless Trump-era boycotts of insufficiently ethical corporations, the emergence of identifiably partisan dairy products or the baffling furor over the lack of a 2016 presidential endorsement from Taylor Swift (for our purposes, a corporate empire unto herself).\n\nIn the past, multibillion-dollar industries like the NBA have played it safe, conservatively pitching themselves toward as wide an audience as possible. Now, they\u2019ve inadvertently fueled that metastasizing culture war simply by acting in their own economic interest. For the NBA, that\u2019s meant playing up their activism to an increasingly diverse, liberal American majority. By pushing the limits of the league\u2019s tolerance for actual protest, Daryl Morey has inadvertently forced us to confront some uncomfortable truths about what we\u2019ve come to ask from\u2014and the compromises we may have to make with\u2014our corporate and cultural behemoths.", "description": "", "authors": ["Derek Robertson", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
