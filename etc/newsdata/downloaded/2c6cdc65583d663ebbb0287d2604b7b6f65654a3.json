Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) asked the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, to investigate the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok to determine if it poses \u201cnational security risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore,\u201d wrote Schumer and Cotton, who currently sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \u201cGiven these concerns, we ask that the Intelligence Community conduct an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other China-based content platforms operating in the U.S. and brief Congress on these findings.\u201d\n\nTikTok published a response to this in an unsigned blog post in which the company stressed its independence from China. The firm stated that it is not \u201csubject to Chinese law,\u201d and stressed that it has \u201cnever been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked.\u201d\n\nThe senators stated that they feared that TikTok would be forced to adhere to Chinese laws which would \u201ccompel Chinese companies to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d Schumer and Cotton worried that TikTok could be a \u201cpotential target of foreign influence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on U.S.-based social media platforms.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) recently called on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review the acquisition of social media app Musical.ly by TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co. over claims that TikTok is used by the Chinese government to censor certain political content.\n\nRubio stated in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that Chinese-owned apps \u201care increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party.\u201d The Treasury secretary heads the CFIUS, which reviews mergers such as that of Musical.ly and TikTok to ensure that they do not damage national security.\n\nRubio stated that there was evidence that TikTok in the United States was censoring political content that was \u201cnot in line\u201d with the Chinese government. Rubio stated that China \u201cis using these apps to advance their foreign policy and globally suppress freedom of speech, expression, and other freedoms that we as Americans so deeply cherish.\u201d In one example, TikTok has blacklisted popular Christian app pray.com from advertising on its app.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
