He led the Toronto Raptors to their first championship in June, triggering celebrations all over Canada. He returned to play in front of the country\u2019s fans in the Clippers\u2019 preseason finale against the Dallas Mavericks in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\n\u201cThey should be excited,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said before the game. \u201cHe did something very special for this country.
