After a nearly three-year hiatus, it\u2019s coming back, with a nifty trailer.\n\nYouTuber Zisteau said in his very first episode of his Minecraft Let\u2019s Play that it was a little weird how much Minecraft he plays on his channel, given that he\u2019s never done a Let\u2019s Play of the game in single-player mode. He\u2019s played community-made challenge maps and plays on the server Mindcrack, but at the time he\u2019d been making Minecraft videos for over three and a half years without playing the game single player.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something a little different, because I\u2019ve been playing for that long and I\u2019ve never had a single-player series,\u201d he said in the video, which came out in August 2014. \u201cI wanted to go back to where it began, as close as I could anyway, to the patch I started playing on.\u201d\n\nThis Minecraft Let\u2019s Play begins in the game\u2019s Alpha 1.1 version, which originally released in September 2010. It\u2019s a very different game than the Minecraft that people play today. As Zisteau grabs resources, he goes over everything the game doesn\u2019t have yet: cakes, biomes, beds. All of these are things that I now take for granted on the rare occasion I play Minecraft.\n\nBut Zistaeu wasn\u2019t planning on staying in Alpha 1.1 forever. By the time he finishes exploring what each update adds to the game, he transitions into the next update, usually with some kind of narrative flourish. The world has exploded, forcing his character into the Nether, he\u2019s gotten shipwrecked, and he\u2019s created magical contraptions to transport his character back home.\n\nAs fascinating as it is to watch Zisteau show how Minecraft has changed over the years, it\u2019s his goofy sense of humour that kept me watching for 87 episodes. Zisteau made it all the way to Beta 1.7 before he took a years-long, unannounced break from the series. There hasn\u2019t been a new episode since November 2016.\n\nOn Friday, he released a trailer for episode 88.\n\nThe voiceovers heard in the trailer are compiled from pre-existing film trailers. Zisteau even released a \u201csource version\u201d of the trailer, which shows all the trailers he compiled the audio from, like Lawnmower Man and Rocky IV.\n\nMost amusingly for me, he creates the name \u201cZisteau\u201d by combining a clip from the trailer for To Wong Foo and the last name of actress Madeleine Stowe as said in the trailer for China Moon. It\u2019s as accurate a representation of his goofiness as all the times he\u2019s shot a cow with an arrow for looking at him funny.\n\nWhen he paused his series in 2016, Zisteau still had a lot of ground to cover if he was going to get up to Minecraft\u2019s current release. After almost three years of further updates, now he has even more of a trek in front of him. Hopefully he came back from his hiatus with a game plan, and a couple wacky hijinks to get in the way.", "description": "Five years ago, one YouTuber began a Minecraft Let\u2019s Play unlike any other, one that spanned all the different versions of the game and examined how it changed over time.
