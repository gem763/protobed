Sign up for the Balance of Power newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on Twitter and Facebook for more.\n\nAs the impeachment crisis worsens for U.S. President Donald Trump, it seems all roads lead to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who is now embroiled in scandals stretching from Ukraine to Iran.\n\nIn northeastern Syria, terrified civilians are trying to work out the safest way to flee as Turkish forces entered towns along the frontier between the two countries, just days after Trump said U.S. troops in the area wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of Ankara\u2019s military offensive.\n\nAnother conflict causing ripples throughout the world \u2014 the trade war \u2014 is showing a flicker of hope. After months of escalation, Trump offered a tacit embrace of something he has resisted for months: A partial deal.\n\nDig deeper into these issues and take a look at some of Bloomberg\u2019s most compelling political photos from the past seven days.\n\nTrump Urged Top Aide to Help Giuliani Client Facing DOJ ChargesFueling long-standing concerns about Trump\u2019s governing style, it\u2019s emerged he pressed then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to persuade the Justice Department to drop a case against an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was a client of Giuliani. Tillerson refused, while others were shocked by the request, Nick Wadhams, Saleha Mohsin, Stephanie Baker and Jennifer Jacobs report.\n\nTurkey Gears for High-Risk War Against a Familiar Foe in SyriaTurkey\u2019s armed forces face a familiar opponent as they launch a major offensive in northeastern Syria. As Selcan Hacaoglu and Marc Champion write, they\u2019ve been fighting versions of the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG, for 35 years.\n\nTrump Mines Weak Spots in Foreign Leaders for Battles at HomeHe might be working to salvage his presidency, but Trump can still smell weakness in others. In his efforts to discredit his domestic enemies, he\u2019s solicited help from Ukraine\u2019s rookie president, a collapsing Italian government, an Australian battling China and Boris Johnson of Brexit-divided Britain, John Follain, Volodymyr Verbyany and Jason Scott report.\n\nWhen This $2 Trillion Market Turns, Start Worrying About BrexitFor post-Brexit Britain, the kindness of strangers and their money will be more vital than ever, Anooja Debnath and John Ainger write. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has amped up his rhetoric that the U.K. will leave the European Union at the end of this month \u2014 even if there is no basis for a future relationship.\n\nThe Plane Crash That Helped a European Leader Take Over a NationThe news that a Polish air force plane had crashed in dense fog in April 2010 transfixed a nation. Among the dead were Poland\u2019s president, his wife and dozens of top officials. The repercussions from that transformed the country from one of Europe\u2019s great successes into one of its biggest renegades. Marek Strzelecki and Rodney Jefferson report.\n\nTrump\u2019s China Deal Yields Plenty of Questions, and CriticsWith the partial agreement with China he announced yesterday, Trump is back in dealmaker mode after months of escalation. But as Shawn Donnan reports, that doesn\u2019t mean the new grand bargain he once promised with Beijing is any more than a small step closer to reality, or that a curtain is being drawn on the uncertainty his trade wars have brought to the global economy.\n\nMoment of Truth on China Is Coming for Rest of Corporate AmericaLong before Daryl Morey\u2019s fateful tweet \u2014 the one that set the NBA on a collision course with China \u2014 the nation had a history of employing economic might to twist corporate arms in Asia. As Matt Townsend reports, it was one of China\u2019s most aggressive efforts yet to bend a western company to its will.\n\nStay Radical or Get Pragmatic? AMLO\u2019s Party Has to Decide For most of its five short years in existence, Mexico\u2019s Morena party has revolved around one politician: Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. AMLO, as he\u2019s known, was elected president in a landslide last July. Now his leadership is at a crossroads, Eric Martin writes.\n\nGM\u2019s Electric Future Means Prosperity for One Michigan Town, Disaster for AnotherEvery decade or so, GM undergoes a transformation to ensure the company\u2019s long-term survival, write Bryan Gruley and David Welch. Invariably, these makeovers turn some communities into winners and others into losers \u2014 in this case, they\u2019re separated by just 35 miles.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for the\u00a0Balance of Power\u00a0newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for more.As the impeachment crisis worsens for U.S. President Donald Trump, it seems all roads lead to his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani", "authors": ["Ruth Pollard"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HYdGavFhlOLAYxJs96HqxA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/f6de7b92eb67094e68af40d893b95759", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
