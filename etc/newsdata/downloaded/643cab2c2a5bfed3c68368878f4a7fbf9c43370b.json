I just wanted to say thank you to Chas and to The Independent for this.\n\nCan you now follow up with articles about chicken and beef please (he doesn\u2019t eat lamb), then we might be a vegetarian household before the end of the year!\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Do we really still have racism, bigotry, discrimination, antisemitism, anti-Muslim prejudices, hatred, intolerance, religious marginalisation and social ostracism in our midst?\n\nWorse is the fact that this could sometimes be practised by academic staff at British universities, places of knowledge and openness.\n\nA few weeks ago, a damning report found that black and minority ethnic students feel victimised and unsafe at Goldsmiths, University of London. This could be the same elsewhere and could be accentuated in post-Brexit times. It is time to build a fairer society.\n\nDr Munjed Farid Al Qutob\n\nLondon NW2\n\nBad deal\n\nWe can only hope that MPs will not vote before actually reading and debating the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson has brought back from Brussels.\n\nComparing it to May\u2019s deal, it\u2019s much worse. Gone are the legal safeguards against international tax evasion (I wonder why?) and for rules to ensure access to trade in the single market.\n\nGone too are genuine guarantees on rights for workers and environmental standards. And if your job depends on selling services into Europe, you don\u2019t get a mention.\n\nIn comes a one way ticket to an Irish border poll, which may explain why nobody in Northern Ireland is keen to vote for it.\n\nIn fact, it opens the path to a disastrous no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020. I didn\u2019t see that option on the ballot paper in 2016.\n\nAnd all this with a promise for a \u201cgood deal\u201d to unite the country? This isn\u2019t a deal for a United Kingdom, but the surest way of breaking up the Union.\n\nMagdalena Williams\n\nLondon\n\nPrincess and the plea\n\nMany people will feel sympathy for Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, in connection with the revelation of her unhappiness over press exposure. However, this story, along with the humiliation of the Queen over the prorogation scandal, should make us all give some thought to the role of the monarchy in modern British life.\n\nNo one would deny that the Queen has worked hard to discharge her role. Equally many will respect the good works that Princes William and Harry have engaged in.\n\nOne has to wonder, however, if monarchy \u2013 looked at in cool, logical terms \u2013 really has any place in the modern world. In fact its very existence may well encourage old fashioned habits of deference, snobbery and privilege.\n\nMany changes in the British constitution are currently clearly required. Along with these we should be looking at the example of flourishing, up-to-date countries like France or Germany where the Head of State is elected, not given the job because of the circumstances of their birth.\n\nThe Rev Andrew McLuskey\n\nMiddlesex\n\nPornography protection\n\nGiven the destructive power of pornography on lives, especially of young people, it is surprising the government has decided to drop plans for age verification checks on pornography sites.\n\nNicky Morgan, the digital secretary, has insisted the government\u2019s commitment to protecting children is unwavering, so why the failure to implement the Bill designed to protect children?\n\nHas she succumbed to The Adam Smith Institute\u2019s claim that the Bill would infringe freedom? Often infringing the freedom of young children is what every responsible adult should do to prevent them permanently damaging themselves.\n\nJonathan Longstaff\n\nEast Sussex\n\nBeware far-right \u201cpinkwashing\u201d\n\nAs lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBT+) activists, academics and community members, we oppose fascism in all its forms. While often the far right is blatantly oppressive of LGBT+ people as well as women, occasionally it uses the tactic of \u201cpinkwashing\u201d, pretending that mistreating other minorities somehow makes us freer and safer.\n\nReligious and racial minorities may be portrayed as \u201cbackward\u201d, so that LGBT+ people and women need to be \u201crescued\u201d by the forces of the extreme right. But no rainbow flag can long conceal the macho violence and abuse of power which lies behind this.\n\nFor example, a meeting on resisting fascism and building solidarities in India and Kashmir at SOAS, University of London, was recently disrupted by masked right-wing extremists claiming to be LGBT+ and trying to justify the seizure of Kashmir in August. The Indian Supreme Court decriminalised gay sex in 2018 and legal experts advised, soon after, that this applied to then-autonomous Kashmir too, though this was not as widely publicised as it might have been.\n\nDecriminalisation was largely due to the work of human rights advocates now under attack by fascists, not the efforts of ruling party politicians such as Subramanian Swamy, who believe that homosexuality is a genetic disorder and threat to national security. Military rule and a social media shutdown have now left LGBT+ Kashmiris isolated and afraid, yet the grim situation is being spun as in their interests.\n\nWe urge people of goodwill not to be taken in by \u201cpinkwashing\u201d wherever it occurs but rather to support LGBT+ struggles for justice, democracy and human rights for all.\n\nSavitri Hensman, Founder, London Black Lesbian and Gay Centre, writer and activist\n\nProfessor Dibyesh Anand, University of Westminster\n\nTrustees, Imaan Muslim LGBTQI group\n\nMeghna Mehra, Founder, All India Queer Association\n\nRafiul Alom Rahman, Founder, The Queer Muslim Project, Delhi\n\nKaushal Bodwal, Hasratein: a queer collective\n\nTaranjit Chana, Campaigner for LGBT+ and race equality\n\nRohit K Dasgupta, Councillor, London Borough of Newham and senior lecturer at Loughborough University\n\nDr Sandeep Bakshi, Senior lecturer in postcolonial and queer literatures and literary translation, University of Paris Diderot\n\nDev Desai, Social activist, ANHAD, Ahmedabad, Gujarat\n\nGee Imaan Semmalar, Trans activist, India\n\nRuth Chawngthu, Founder, Nazariya: A Grassroots LGBT-Straight Alliance\n\nDr Shakuntala Banaji, LSE\n\nDr Polly Withers, LSE media and communications & Middle East centre\n\nAnjum Mouj, LQBTQI activist and campaigner\n\nDavid Landau\n\nRuth Bashall, Human Rights activist\n\nDr Suhraiya Jivraj, Director of the Centre for Sexuality, Race & Gender Justice, Kent Law School, University of Kent\n\nNishant Upadhyay, University of Colorado Boulder\n\nYasmine Kherfi, Projects Assistant, Middle East Centre\n\nJack McGinn, LSE Middle East Centre\n\nSanaz Raji, Independent Scholar & Organiser, Unis Resist Border Controls\n\nNila Gupta\n\nSushmita Verma, Researcher, IIST, University of Erasmus, Rotterdam\n\nDev Desai, Social activist, ANHAD, Ahmedabad, Gujarat\n\nBittu Kondaiah, Telangana Hijra Intersex Transgender Samiti\n\nShambhavi Saxena, Writer, Queer Feminist, New Delhi\n\nPoulomi Desai\n\nMumtaz Karimjee\n\nAbha Bhaiya\n\nDr Stan Papoulias, King\u2019s College London\n\nDimple Oberoi Vahali\n\nBob Cant\n\nRahul Rao, Senior lecturer in politics, SOAS, University of London\n\nDr Gabriel Varghese, Associate research fellow, Kenyon Institute (Council for British Research in the Levant), Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem\n\nAlessandra Mezzadri, Senior lecturer, development studies, SOAS\n\nAkriti Mehta, King\u2019s College London\n\nAkanksha Mehta, Goldsmith\u2019s, University of London\n\nReshna Begum, Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP) Social Worker\n\nDr Ameet Mukherjee\n\nNazmia Jamal\n\nSahed Ali, Photographic Technician in East London\n\nFeyzi Ismail, SOAS, University of London\n\nDr Shanon Shah, King\u2019s College London\n\nDr Silvia Posocco, Birkbeck, University of London\n\nDecolonizing Sexualities Network\n\nDr Manjeet Ramgotra, Lecturer in political theory, Department of Politics and International Studies, SOAS, University of London\n\nSita Balani, King\u2019s College London\n\nAlastair Hendy, Photographer, writer, shop owner\n\nDr Humaira Saeed\n\nMichael Etheridge, Unison Official\n\nCamille Kumar, Anti-violence campaigner\n\nTabitha Benjamin, Butch, Please!", "description": "I have been a vegetarian for 19 years however my husband is not despite my best efforts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/12/pigs-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
