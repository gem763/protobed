Hunt Transport Services Inc. (NASDAQ: JBHT) reported third quarter 2019 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.40, a nickel less than consensus estimates.\n\nThe Lowell, Arkansas-based company reported an 8.6% year-over-year increase in revenue excluding fuel surcharges. Total revenue was nearly $2.4 billion in the period.\n\nIntegrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) revenue through Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 increased 36% year-over-year to $205 million. Further, the company reported that $46 million of third-party dray costs and $16 million of its independent contractor costs were processed through the platform in the quarter. Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360, a digital marketplace for carriers and shippers to match loads, is now on a $1 billion annual run rate.\n\nA good portion of the company's conference call centered on questions around Marketplace and the initiatives within Marketplace. Management said that the platform is still in the infancy stage and that there is still a good deal of data science work to do. However, one of the big initiatives for the platform is addressing the 7 to 11 million shipments on the road that could move via intermodal.\n\nThe thought is that if shippers have access to the data and real-time monitoring load availability, these loads are ripe for conversion to intermodal. Management also seemed emboldened by the intermodal growth plans at the eastern railroads, which have stated that they would like to grow volumes by 10% in 2020. While intermodal conversion is still subject to normal market conditions/fundamentals like fuel prices, service costs and overall rail service, the company sees many digital growth opportunities available to it.\n\nIntermodal\n\nIntermodal revenue increased 2% to $1.24 billion as volumes were flat year-over-year. Transcontinental loads were up 7% as loads in the company's eastern network declined by 11%. Intermodal revenue per load increased 2% year-over-year (+5% excluding fuel), which was attributed to rates, freight mix and fuel surcharges. The division reported a 10% decline in operating income, excluding one-offs like arbitration, legal claims and a customer bankruptcy, due to increased purchased transportation costs, higher container repositioning costs, lower container turns and driver recruiting/retention efforts.\n\nManagement said that intermodal bid season is just getting underway and it's really too early to determine how revenue per load will shake out. That said, they did say that if costs are up they expect to get positive pricing to at least cover these cost increases. Further, management said that bid compliance is improving and that intermodal pricing could improve next year even if truckload (TL) pricing moves lower. They expect rail service to continue to improve, especially as other rail commodities remain weak. J.B. Hunt is expecting intermodal margins to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nJ.B. Hunt Key Performance Indicators\n\nDedicated\n\nDedicated revenue increased 28% to $696 million. Revenue per truck per week increased by 9% year-over-year (+11% excluding fuel) to $4,927. Management cited a prior acquisition, rate increases and improved fluidity as the reasons for the increase. The division had nearly 1,300 additional revenue-producing trucks in the quarter compared to the same period in 2018. Dedicated operating income increased 80% year-over-year, excluding charges, to $78 million.\n\nStory continues", "description": "J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc.
