His articles have appeared in the New York Times, The Atlantic and the BBC, among others.\n\nAt Liberty University, all anyone can talk about is Jerry Falwell Jr. Just not in public.\n\n\u201cWhen he does stupid stuff, people will mention it to others they consider confidants and not keep it totally secret,\u201d a trusted adviser to Falwell, the school\u2019s president and chancellor, told me. \u201cBut they won\u2019t rat him out.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat\u2019s beginning to change.\n\nOver the past year, Falwell, a prominent evangelical leader and supporter of President Donald Trump, has come under increasing scrutiny. News outlets have reported on business deals by Liberty University benefiting Falwell\u2019s friends. Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen claimed that he had helped Falwell clean up racy \u201cpersonal\u201d photographs.\n\nBased on scores of new interviews and documents obtained for this article, concerns about Falwell\u2019s behavior go well beyond that\u2014and it\u2019s causing longtime, loyal Liberty University officials to rapidly lose faith in him.\n\nMore than two dozen current and former high-ranking Liberty University officials and close associates of Falwell spoke to me or provided documents for this article, opening up\u2014for the first time at an institution so intimately associated with the Falwell family\u2014about what they\u2019ve experienced and why they don\u2019t think he\u2019s the right man to lead Liberty University or serve as a figurehead in the Christian conservative movement.\n\nIn interviews over the past eight months, they depicted how Falwell and his wife, Becki, consolidated power at Liberty University and how Falwell presides over a culture of self-dealing, directing university resources into projects and real estate deals in which his friends and family have stood to make personal financial gains. Among the previously unreported revelations are Falwell\u2019s decision to hire his son Trey\u2019s company to manage a shopping center owned by the university, Falwell\u2019s advocacy for loans given by the university to his friends, and Falwell\u2019s awarding university contracts to businesses owned by his friends.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a school; we\u2019re a real estate hedge fund,\u201d said a senior university official with inside knowledge of Liberty\u2019s finances. \u201cWe\u2019re not educating; we\u2019re buying real estate every year and taking students\u2019 money to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nLiberty employees detailed other instances of Falwell\u2019s behavior that they see as falling short of the standard of conduct they expect from conservative Christian leaders, from partying at nightclubs, to graphically discussing his sex life with employees, to electioneering that makes uneasy even those who fondly remember the heyday of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr., the school\u2019s founder and Falwell Jr.\u2019s father, and his Moral Majority.\n\nIn January, the Wall Street Journal reported that in the run-up to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Cohen hired John Gauger, a Liberty University employee who runs a private consulting firm, to manipulate online polls in Trump\u2019s favor. Not previously reported is the fact that, according to a half-dozen high-level Liberty University sources, when Gauger traveled to New York to collect payment from Cohen, he was joined by Trey Falwell, a vice president at Liberty. During that trip, Trey posted a now-deleted photo to Instagram of around $12,000 in cash spread on a hotel bed, raising questions about his knowledge of Gauger\u2019s poll-rigging work. Trey did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nJerry Falwell Jr. responded to more than two dozen written questions, defending his actions and criticizing the reporting of this article. \u201cI fear that the true information I am sharing in good faith will simply not make any difference. And will only result in more questions,\u201d Falwell said. He declined to answer subsequent questions.\n\nThe string of news articles over the past several months has had a minimal effect on Falwell\u2019s leadership of Liberty University. As the namesake of the school\u2019s founder, Falwell has never had his position seriously challenged. Liberty is thriving financially. Its enrollment has surged past 110,000 students\u2014the vast majority of whom are enrolled online\u2014and across its campus in the foothills of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains, the hum of backhoes and bulldozers is omnipresent as construction crews work to keep pace with the university\u2019s swelling ambitions.\n\nBut these new revelations speak to rising discontent with Falwell\u2019s stewardship. The people interviewed for this article include members of Liberty\u2019s board of trustees, senior university officials, and rank-and-file staff members who work closely with Falwell. They are reluctant to speak out\u2014there\u2019s no organized, open dissent to Falwell on campus\u2014but they said they see it as necessary to save Liberty University and the values it once stood for. They said they believe in the Christian tradition and in the conservative politics at the heart of Liberty\u2019s mission. Many knew Jerry Falwell Sr. and remember him with clear affection. \u201cThe day that man died was the day I lost a father,\u201d one current university official said. All count themselves as conservatives. Many are strong supporters of Trump.\n\n\n\nJerry Falwell Jr. gestures while speaking as his wife, Becki, listens during a town hall at Liberty University on Nov. 28, 2018. | AP Photo/Steve Helber\n\nI am a graduate of Liberty University, and my time there overlapped the tenures of both Falwell Sr. and his son. Over the course of my years of reporting on the university, the Falwells have granted me considerable access, including sit-down interviews in the offices of both Falwell Jr. and his brother, the Rev. Jonathan Falwell, who leads Thomas Road Baptist Church. I\u2019ve written candidly about my time there as a student, reported about political divisions on campus and revealed that Trey co-owns a gay-friendly hostel in Miami.\n\nMembers of the Liberty University community are generally reluctant to go on the record. The school uses nondisclosure agreements to prohibit many university employees or board members from openly discussing what they\u2019ve seen Falwell do. (\u201cAll trustees sign a confidentiality agreement that does not expire at the close of Board service,\u201d Liberty\u2019s attorney told board members in an email that was sent earlier this month after the school received inquiries from reporters on some of the issues outlined in this article.) Tenure and its protections are not available to Liberty faculty members outside the law school. If you teach or work at Liberty, you must get approval from Falwell\u2019s office before you speak to the media. Talk to reporters without his approval\u2014or publicly criticize him, even obliquely\u2014and you could lose your job. If you\u2019re a board member and do the same, you could get forced out, even if you have unimpeachable credentials in the Christian conservative movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dictatorship,\u201d one current high-level employee of the school said. \u201cNobody craps at the university without Jerry\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody is scared for their life. Everybody walks around in fear,\u201d said a current university employee who agreed to speak for this article only after purchasing a burner phone, fearing that Falwell was monitoring their communications. The fear is not limited to Liberty\u2019s campus. Several people who lack any tie to Liberty but live in the school\u2019s hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia, refused to go on the record for this story, fearing Falwell would take revenge upon them and their families. \u201cFear is probably his most powerful weapon,\u201d a former senior university official said.\n\nBut even those who fear have their breaking points.\n\nIn speaking out, said one longtime current university employee with close ties to the school\u2019s first family, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m betraying them in some way. But someone\u2019s gotta tell the freakin\u2019 truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the difference between right and wrong,\u201d a current high-ranking university official said. \u201cNot even \u2018being a Christian,\u2019 but being a good person, versus people who manipulate the system\u201d\n\nRev. Jerry Falwell Sr. looks around the inside of an auxiliary sanctuary at the new Thomas Road Baptist Church in June 2006. | AP Photo/Steve Helber\n\nPART I: The Kingdom\n\nLong before his May 2007 death, the Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr.\u2014the Baptist preacher who founded Liberty University and whose creation of the Moral Majority marked the emergence of white evangelical conservatives as a national political force\u2014made clear how he wanted the empire he\u2019d built to be divided when the time came.\n\nHis two sons, Jerry Jr. and Jonathan, had each inherited different aspects of their father\u2019s persona. For Jerry Jr., the elder of the two by four years, it was the stomach for partisan politics, ability to throw an elbow and the savvy to court influential friends. For Jonathan, it was the calling to ministry, his easy way with people and charisma as a public speaker. Jerry Jr. would preside over Liberty University, and Jonathan would lead Thomas Road Baptist Church. Each son had worked under their father at the respective institutions; each knew well what those positions would require.\n\nA bigger question remained: Who would step into Falwell Sr.\u2019s unique role as a national figurehead at the crossroads of evangelical Christianity and conservative politics\u2014a man who counted presidents and senators as friends, a public figure whose outspoken statements riled critics and endeared him to conservatives, and whose endorsement carried real weight with a certain segment of voters?\n\nLeft: Jerry Falwell Jr. speaks at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

Jonathan Falwell introduces then-presidential candidate Mike Huckabee in Feb. 2008. | AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, AP PHOTO/The News & Advance, Jill Nance\n\nAfter the death of Falwell Sr., many within his tight-knit community expected Jonathan to pick up the mantle. A preacher by training, Jonathan had pastoral sensitivities and a personable nature that his brother Jerry lacked.\n\n\u201cJonathan\u2019s a great speaker and orator, a people person,\u201d one current top Liberty employee close to the Falwell family told me. \u201cJerry can\u2019t complete a sentence in person. \u2026 He\u2019s nervous. It\u2019s just not him, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d\n\nBut Jerry had a passion for politics, a talent for riling up a certain type of cultural conservative and a spouse, Becki, who, while publicly playing the role of the quiet, supportive, Baptist housewife, knew how to get her way.\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s a head of every family,\u201d said a former university employee who worked closely with Becki Falwell for many years. \u201cBut what turns the head? The neck. She\u2019s the neck that turns the head wherever she wants it.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil Big Jerry died, you wouldn\u2019t have known [Becki] if she walked up and slapped you,\u201d said a former longtime Liberty official. \u201cBig Jerry dies, and all of a sudden, [if] you\u2019re walking down the hall and you didn\u2019t greet her right, you\u2019re fired.\u201d As if to underline this point, one longtime university employee shared a 2012 email in which Becki contacted four school executives at 7:06 p.m. to complain that a low-level university employee had posted a Facebook status on her personal account criticizing a lack of adequate parking on campus. \u201cSomeone needs to talk to this girl. I don\u2019t think that we allow employees to post negative remarks about Liberty,\u201d Becki wrote to the school officials in a message that included a screenshot of the employee\u2019s post. Shortly before 9:00 p.m., one senior official replied, \u201cWe are attempting to call her at home right now.\u201d The woman in question did not respond to requests for comment, but according to her Facebook profile, she is no longer an employee of Liberty University.\n\nIn an email obtained for this article, Becki Falwell tells several high-level Liberty officials that \"someone needs to talk to\" a low-level university employee who complained about parking availability on campus in a post on her personal Facebook feed. (Email addresses and surname of employee have been redacted.) | Obtained by Brandon Ambrosino\n\nA half-dozen people with inside knowledge of the Falwell family said that, after Falwell\u2019s death, Becki pushed to shrink Jonathan\u2019s role at the university\u2014a move current and former Liberty officials described as the start of Jerry and Becki consolidating power.\n\nRight after his father died, Jonathan held a position with Liberty University that was limited but which allowed him \u201cto make sure [Liberty] kept its compass,\u201d as one former longtime Liberty official put it. According to a 2008 statement announcing Jonathan\u2019s appointment as the school\u2019s vice chancellor for spiritual affairs, his responsibilities would include upholding the \u201cdoctrinal integrity of the university\u201d and advising his brother on \u201cmatters of faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure \u2026 that we never go in any direction that we as a university shouldn\u2019t go,\u201d Jonathan said in the statement at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s the area that I\u2019m going to focus on and do everything I can to ensure that my dad\u2019s life\u2019s work stays continuing to fulfill the mission that he had in 1971,\u201d the year the university was formed.\n\nBut now, top Liberty officials say Jonathan doesn\u2019t hold any sway\u2014spiritual or otherwise\u2014over the university that grew out of the church he leads. \u201cAs a general rule,\u201d said a former high-ranking university official with longstanding ties to Liberty and the Falwell family, Falwell Sr. \u201cspoke every Wednesday in [convocation] all year long. His desire was that whoever was the pastor of Thomas Road would [continue the tradition and] speak at Liberty. I think Jonathan speaks \u2026 maybe a few times per year.\u201d\n\n\u201cJerry never removed Jonathan,\u201d a former top Liberty official said. \u201cHe just kind of pushed him aside.\u201d For one, Jerry used Liberty\u2019s abundant resources to bring his father\u2019s diffuse properties under his control. \u201cHe bought all the [Thomas Road Baptist Church] properties, [Liberty Christian Academy], Jonathan\u2019s building at the airport, and a couple of others. Jonathan complained but never stood up to [Jerry] because he knew [Jerry] controlled the purse strings,\u201d the former top official said. Jonathan did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhile longtime confidants of the Falwell family make clear that Becki loves Jonathan\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re family after all,\u201d said one former longtime Liberty employee\u2014many feel that she worked hard to make sure that everyone knew it was her husband, and not her brother-in-law, who would assume the elder Falwell\u2019s mantle as a leading figurehead in the conservative evangelical movement. Becki\u2019s message to Jerry, one high-ranking university official said, was simple: You are Jerry Falwell Junior.\n\nAs in: the new Jerry Falwell\u2014the new leader of the Religious Right.\n\nA Liberty student prays during convocation at the university in February 2013. | AP/Norm Shafer\n\nLiberty University has transformed under Jerry Falwell Jr.\u2019s leadership. When he took over as president in 2007, the school, which is a nonprofit, had listed assets of just over $259 million on its then most recent IRS Form 990; in its filing for the fiscal year ending in June 2017, its assets surpassed $2.5 billion. That number is now more than $3 billion, according to public statements Falwell made in 2018.\n\nThat growth is driven largely by a vast increase in the number of online students at the school, who now number some 95,000. Many Falwell confidants are concerned with where they see that university tuition money going: into university-funded construction and real estate projects that enrich the Falwell family and their friends.\n\nAmong these projects is a Lynchburg shopping center that is owned by Liberty University but which members of the Falwell family have a personal financial stake in operating, according to emails obtained by me.\n\nIn an email dated July 18, 2012, Falwell informed several university executives that his son, Trey Falwell, was \u201cstarting a new company to do the management\u201d of properties owned by the school, including the shopping center. Trey Falwell, whose given name is Jerry Falwell III, is now a vice president of Liberty University. On August 7, 2012, Trey registered that privately owned company, JF Management LLC, with Campbell County, Virginia. As the address of its principal office, he gave the location of a house where he and his wife, Sarah, resided.\n\nIn a July 2012 email obtained for this article, Jerry Falwell Jr. tells several high-ranking Liberty University officials that his son, Trey, is starting a new company to manage a property owned by the school. (Email addresses, phone number and names of cc-ed employees have been redacted by Politico.) | Obtained by Brandon Ambrosino\n\nExperts on tax law and nonprofit organizations said that having the president of a nonprofit university directing university business to a company led by his son would be troubling.\n\n\u201cIt raises red flags to have your kids being able to profit off the activities of the organization,\u201d said Philip Hackney, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh Law School who specializes in taxation and nonprofit management. As a general matter of law, \u201ca nonprofit director or officer owes a \u2018duty of loyalty\u2019 to the nonprofit. What this means is he cannot take unfair advantage of the nonprofit he controls to his advantage.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the responsibility of nonprofit leaders to look out for the best interests of their organization, Hackney said, and as a standard practice, those leaders should be able to show how their financial transactions further the nonprofit\u2019s mission in some way.\n\nAsked how the property-management arrangement furthers Liberty\u2019s mission, Falwell said the shopping center was donated to the school in poor condition. \u201cFrankly, there are fewer professional property managers who would be interested in running it for us.\u201d\n\nA stone\u2019s throw from the shopping center is a LaQuinta Inn whose ownership also raises questions about whether Falwell is directing business to family and friends.\n\nThe LaQuinta is owned by Comeback Inn LLC, which is registered to Chris Doyle, who manages real estate for the university. In a December 2018 affidavit, Falwell Jr. described Doyle as his \u201cpartner in \u2026 real estate ventures in Virginia.\u201d Multiple current and former university officials with knowledge of the LaQuinta arrangement said Trey Falwell is a silent shareholder in Comeback Inn.\n\nIn an email responding to questions, Doyle declined to discuss the issue. \u201cIf my personal and business relationships are of value and interest to the public, I should write a book and [see] no reason to comment at this time,\u201d Doyle said.\n\nEmails obtained for this article show that on at least one occasion, university employees were asked to promote the LaQuinta on the school\u2019s website\u2014what several current and former high-ranking Liberty officials and employees described as part of a process where the school \u201cfunnels business\u201d to the hotel.\n\nFalwell denied having a financial interest in Comeback Inn. \u201cI have not financially benefitted from Comeback Inn\u2019s business and I have never owned any interest in Comeback Inn, LLC,\u201d Falwell said in a statement. He did not answer for his son. \u201cI will let Trey Falwell respond separately on his own behalf if he has any comment regarding your question.\u201d Trey Falwell did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cWhat I have found over the years is if something doesn\u2019t make sense and Jerry really wants it to happen, he in some form or fashion has a personal interest,\u201d said a current high-ranking Liberty employee with knowledge of Falwell\u2019s financial dealings.\n\n\n\nAP\n\nThe line between where the Falwell family\u2019s wealth begins and Liberty\u2019s finances end is blurry.\n\nUniversity officials describe Liberty loaning money to the Falwells\u2019 friends, even when these loans arguably are not in the school\u2019s financial interests. According to emails and loan documents obtained for this article, in 2014, the university gave loans of at least $200,000 to Prototype Tourism LLC, a \u201cdestination marketing\u201d company founded by Liberty graduate Josh Oppenheimer, whom Jerry Falwell Jr. described to me as \u201ca friendly supporter.\u201d According to emails I\u2019ve reviewed, several high-ranking Liberty officials knew about the loan, including Vice President Trey Falwell. The graduate had difficulty repaying the loan\u2014\u201cnot surprised,\u201d Trey wrote in an email.\n\nWhen asked about the loan, Jerry Falwell Jr. clarified the school\u2019s role with Prototype Tourism. \u201cLiberty University was not simply a lender, but was a minority investor in Prototype Tourism, LLC,\u201d he wrote. Falwell described the company\u2019s goal as promoting tourism to Lynchburg. \u201cDue diligence was performed by multiple individuals who discussed the pros and cons and the consensus was that it was worthwhile to proceed,\u201d Falwell wrote. \u201cIn the end, I reluctantly agreed with the recommendation and allowed the transaction to proceed. In hindsight, it was not a good decision. \u2026 LU lost its investment and the loan portion of the deal was only partially paid back.\u201d\n\nOther loans were precursors to massive contracts. In 2013, Robert Moon, a friend of Falwell\u2019s with deep family ties to the Falwells, founded Construction Management Associates Inc., a construction company devoted to work on and around campus. Previously unreported is the fact that Liberty gave Moon a loan of $750,000 to form the company before awarding it more than $130 million in contracts and selling it land owned by the university.\n\nWhen I described this arrangement to Hackney, the associate professor at Pitt Law, he said: \u201cThis is not standard or good practice. \u2026 A nonprofit that is not in the business of loaning money has little reason to be conducting such activity. It raises issues of whether these are in fact charitable activities that further the nonprofit\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nAsked whether such loans were a common practice for the university, Falwell wrote in an email that \u201cLiberty has considered investments in other local start-up businesses that would help the University\u2019s business model and the local economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d Falwell continued, \u201cLiberty University has one of the largest unrestricted endowments in the nation and frequently invests in hundreds, if not thousands, of companies across the world purely for the return on investment whether the company has any nexus to Liberty\u2019s mission or not. The same is true of every major university.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Falwell continued, \u201cI have not personally benefited financially from CMA\u2019s or any other contractor\u2019s work for Liberty University nor has any member of my family.\u201d\n\nAt the outset, some in Falwell\u2019s inner circle were not so confident in the arrangement with Moon. Before his CMA Inc. became Liberty\u2019s go-to contractor, the school bid out its construction work through an office on campus. (\u201cFree enterprise tends to do pretty well,\u201d one high-ranking university official said.) The prospect of changing that\u2014giving CMA control over campus construction and its associated costs\u2014rankled some senior university officials.\n\nEarly on in the CMA partnership, before CMA became the university\u2019s single-largest contractor, Charles Spence, the school\u2019s then-vice president of planning and construction, expressed unease about the high costs Moon was quoting for certain school projects. \u201cJerry I am very concerned about cost control on all the projects,\u201d he wrote to Falwell in a November 2014 email. \u201cOver the last couple of weeks we have had a lot of meetings and conversations on cost and cost overruns. We are just seeing the information begin to trickle in and there really don\u2019t seem to be good answers just a response that the cost we are seeing are fair, and being handled appropriately.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that I am over reacting,\u201d Spence continued, \u201cbut I assure you I am concerned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am fine with going back to bidding every project out if CMA can\u2019t run with the big dogs!\u201d Falwell replied. \u201cLet\u2019s hold their feet to the fire!\u201d\n\nIn each of the two years that followed, Liberty paid CMA more than $62 million, part of at least $138 million in contracts from Liberty since the company was formed, according to publicly available tax documents.\n\nSenior Liberty officials might whisper about the propriety of these business deals, but they told me that Falwell\u2019s decisions on campus are rarely ever challenged by the school\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cThere\u2019s no accountability,\u201d a former high-ranking university officer said. \u201cJerry\u2019s got pretty free reign to wheel and deal professionally and personally. The board will approve an annual budget, but beyond that \u2026 he doesn\u2019t go to the board to get approval. \u2026 It simply doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Falwell said he and Moon \u201care on friendly terms and [have] interacted socially in past years but neither of us would list the other on their list of close friends and associates. It is completely a typical arms-length business relationship.\u201d\n\nBut there is evidence to the contrary\u2014much of it documented on the Falwells\u2019 own social media accounts.\n\nIn June 2013, for instance, the year CMA was formed, Falwell shared a photo on Instagram showing him, Becki and Trey joining Moon for a cruise down the James River on Moon\u2019s private boat. When asked about the photographs, Falwell admitted to joining Moon on his boat \u201cabout five or six times.\u201d \u201cThese afternoon outings did not cause me to lose my negotiation skills or abandon my fiduciary duties to enter into deals in the interest of the University,\u201d Falwell wrote.\n\nIn this June 2013 Instagram post by Jerry Falwell Jr,.

Falwell said in his statement that he recalls \u201cdiscussing University business\u201d on the trip.\n\nDuring the trip, photos were taken of Jerry and Trey Falwell partying at a Miami nightclub\u2014photos that multiple Liberty University officials said Jerry Falwell tried to make disappear.\n\nIn this July 19, 2014, photo from Miami Beach's WALL nightclub, Jerry Falwell Jr. (circled here in red) can be seen among the clubgoers. | Seth Browarnik/WorldRedEye.com\n\nPART II: The Fixer\n\nOn July 19, 2014, popular Swedish DJ John Dahlb\u00e4ck performed at Wall, a nightclub in Miami Beach, Fla. That night, the club happened to have a photographer on-site to grab candid shots of the revelry. The photos were shared online by World Red Eye, an outlet that documents Miami\u2019s nightlife scene, and Jerry and Trey Falwell were visible in some of the pictures\u2014the outlet identified Trey by name.\n\nIn a statement on August 21, Jerry Falwell denied the existence of any photo of him at the club. \u201cThere was no picture snapped of me at WALL nightclub or any other nightclub,\u201d Falwell wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sure you already knew that though.\u201d\n\nWhen told that I had obtained a photo of him for this article, Falwell said I was \u201cterribly mistaken.\u201d \u201cIf you show me the picture, I can probably help you out,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think you are making some incorrect assumptions, or have been told false things or are seeing something that was photo--shopped.\u201d\n\nAfter I sent him the photo, as well as a photo of Trey at Wall, Falwell responded: \u201cI never asked anyone to get rid of any pictures on the internet of me and I never have seen the picture you claim is of me below. If the person in the picture is me, it was likely photo-shopped.\u201d In a second email sent 23 minutes later, Falwell wrote: \u201cBut the bigger question, Brandon, is why would I want a picture like that taken down if I had seen it?\u201d\n\nLeft: A zoomed-in close-up of Jerry Falwell Jr. in the crowd at WALL nightclub in Miami Beach, taken from the photo at the start of this section.

To remedy the situation, multiple Liberty staffers said Falwell went to John Gauger, whom they characterized as his \u201cIT guy,\u201d and asked him to downgrade the photos\u2019 prominence on Google searches. Gauger did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGauger has worked at Liberty since earning his MBA from the school in 2009. In 2016, he was promoted to become the school\u2019s chief information officer about a year and a half after he was named deputy CIO. To several university sources, his rapid rise to the C-suite was shocking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being disrespectful, but John was a nobody,\u201d one longtime Liberty official said. \u201cAnd the next thing you know, he\u2019s high up in IT.\u201d\n\nLongtime Liberty officials describe Gauger as a sort of fixer for Falwell, a man promoted because he would do what Falwell asked of him without complaint. But Gauger is more than just a university employee: Since 2009, Gauger has also run RedFinch LLC, an online business he founded that specializes in search-engine marketing and does lucrative contract work for Liberty. Tax records show Liberty paid RedFinch $123,950 during 2016, for what sources described as search-engine recruitment of online students for the university. Gauger did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRedFinch\u2019s online work for the school goes beyond typical SEO marketing. In an email from August 2013 obtained for this article, Falwell asked Gauger to defend him in the comments section of a local news article that Falwell felt reflected too negatively on him. Falwell even emailed Gauger the exact wording to post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having my RedFinch guys blow this up right away,\u201d Gauger responded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how it goes.\u201d\n\nWhen Falwell told Gauger a different employee already chimed into the conversation, Gauger insisted that he\u2019d \u201chave a few accounts turn the conversation elsewhere just for good measure.\u201d\n\nAccording to several longtime Liberty employees, it\u2019s extremely unusual for university employees to be allowed to own side businesses that do contract work for the school. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a problem with RedFinch because there never was any clear and distinct lines,\u201d one former Liberty employee told me. \u201cYou can\u2019t work at Liberty 8-5 on the clock and get paid from somebody else for the same hours.\u201d\n\nMultiple university officials said Gauger is very close, both personally and professionally, with the Falwells, especially Trey. At Liberty, Gauger reports to Trey, and Trey answers only to his dad.\n\nIn January, the Wall Street Journal reported that in 2014 and 2015, Michael Cohen hired Gauger\u2019s side business, RedFinch LLC, to rig online polls in Donald Trump\u2019s favor while he considered a run for the presidency. Gauger\u2019s work consisted of writing a computer script to repeatedly vote for Trump in two online polls; his company would get paid $50,000 in return. Instead, Gauger told the Journal that after a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Cohen paid Gauger roughly one-fourth of that amount\u2014between $12,000 and $13,000 in cash\u2014and gave him a boxing glove worn by a mixed martial arts fighter.\n\nThrough his lawyer, Cohen, who is serving a three-year prison sentence for tax fraud, making false statements to Congress and violating campaign finance laws, declined a request to comment for this article.\n\nPreviously unreported about this incident is that Trey joined Gauger on the January 2015 trip to New York, and posted a photo to Instagram showing a large amount of cash spread atop a bed in a hotel room. Liberty officials who saw the since-deleted post and described its contents said it raised questions about Trey\u2019s involvement in the pro-Trump poll-rigging effort.\n\n\u201cThe idiot posted [a picture of] money on a bed?!\u201d one current senior Liberty official said. \u201cWhy do that if you\u2019re not involved with it?\u201d\n\nLiberty officials also pointed to a tweet sent out by the university\u2019s Twitter account on January 23, 2014, linking to one of the polls that the Wall Street Journal reported Gauger had rigged. The poll was conducted by CNBC and asked readers to vote for the top American business leaders.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 2014, Liberty University's official Twitter account asked its followers to vote for Donald Trump in an online poll hosted by CNBC. The online poll was among those Michael Cohen, Trump's attorney, paid John Gauger, a Liberty employee and owner of RedFinch Solutions LLC, to manipulate. | Twitter\n\nAs a nonprofit, Liberty University is legally prohibited from engaging in \u201cpolitical campaign activity,\u201d to use the IRS\u2019 phrase, at the risk of losing its nonprofit status.\n\nWhen asked about the tweet, Falwell told me he authorized the university\u2019s marketing department to send it as way of thanking Trump for speaking at Liberty. \u201cA representative of the Trump business organization asked for Liberty University to use Twitter to encourage followers to vote for Donald Trump in the annual CNBC poll. We often get requests from Convocation speakers to promote their books, movies, music and other projects. And we do it all the time,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cAfter speaking for free at [a 2012 Liberty] Convocation and being so complimentary to our University in his remarks, I considered Donald Trump to be a friend of Liberty University and was happy to publicize the poll in hopes that Liberty followers would be willing to vote for him on the heels of his very positive recent campus appearance.\u201d\n\nFalwell noted that at the time the tweet was sent, \u201cDonald Trump was not a candidate for president and no one at Liberty even knew he would run for President.\u201d However, as the Wall Street Journal reported\u2014and as several sources independently confirmed in the course of my reporting for this article\u2014Cohen had hired Gauger, a Liberty employee, to rig the poll in Trump\u2019s favor for the purposes of garnering support ahead of his presidential bid.\n\n\u201cA 501(c)(3) organization trying to influence a poll so that a candidate\u2019s fortunes are promoted or demoted is not permitted,\u201d said Eve Borenstein, an attorney and tax expert known as the \u201cQueen of the 990,\u201d a moniker used to introduce her ahead of congressional testimony she gave about the IRS Form 990 in 2012.\n\nWhile 501(c)(3) organizations are permitted to \u201cdo objective analysis of [an] electoral horse race,\u201d said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor at Stetson University College of Law, \u201ctweeting out a rigged poll if Liberty knew it was rigged probably does not fall into that safe harbor.\u201d\n\nLiberty officials said that the arrangement is characteristic of how Falwell wields power. \u201cThis paints a picture of how Jerry operates,\u201d one former high-ranking university official said. \u201cGauger gets promoted, [Liberty] contracts for RedFinch for online recruitment \u2026 and [Gauger] gets hooked up with people like Cohen to make more money via RedFinch.\u201d And in the end, Falwell gets what he really wants: \u201cA guy that will do whatever he is told.\u201d\n\nMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer, leaves federal court in Dec. 2018. | AP\n\nMichael Cohen\u2019s connection to Jerry Falwell Jr., veers into deeply personal territory.\n\nIn May 2019, Reuters reported that Cohen helped Falwell contain the fallout from some racy \u201cpersonal\u201d photos. Later that month, Falwell took to Todd Starnes\u2019 radio talk show to rebut the claims.\n\n\u201cThis report is not accurate,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cThere are no compromising or embarrassing photos of me.\u201d\n\nMembers of Falwell\u2019s inner circle took note of the phrasing.\n\n\u201cIf you read how Jerry is framing his response, you can see he is being very selective,\u201d one of Falwell\u2019s confidants said. Racy photos do exist, but at least some of the photos are of his wife, Becki, as the Miami Herald confirmed in June.\n\nLongtime Liberty officials close to Falwell told me the university president has shown or texted his male confidants\u2014including at least one employee who worked for him at Liberty\u2014photos of his wife in provocative and sexual poses.\n\nAt Liberty, Falwell is \u201cvery, very vocal\u201d about his \u201csex life,\u201d in the words of one Liberty official\u2014a characterization multiple current and former university officials and employees interviewed for this story support. In a car ride about a decade ago with a senior university official who has since left Liberty, \u201call he wanted to talk about was how he would nail his wife, how she couldn\u2019t handle [his penis size], and stuff of that sort,\u201d this former official recalled. Falwell did not respond to questions about this incident.\n\nMore than simply talking with employees about his wife in a sexual manner, on at least one occasion, Falwell shared a photo of his wife wearing what appeared to be a French maid costume, according to a longtime Liberty employee with firsthand knowledge of the image and the fallout that followed.\n\nFalwell intended to send the image to his and Becki\u2019s personal trainer, Ben Crosswhite, as a \u201cthank you\u201d for helping his wife achieve her fitness goals, the employee said. In the course of texting, Falwell accidentally sent the message to several other people, necessitating a cleanup.\n\nIn a statement, Falwell denied this. \u201cI never had any picture of Becki Falwell dressed in a French maid uniform, and never sent such a non-existent photo to Ben Crosswhite.\u201d\n\nCrosswhite did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Falwells\u2019 close relationship with Crosswhite is the source of consternation for some of Liberty\u2019s top brass because of what they characterize as a sweetheart business deal Falwell had the university offer Crosswhite.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Liberty University began renting space to Crosswhite for use as a fitness center. \u201cThe facility was specifically built into the old Racket Club for Jerry and Becki to train privately\u201d with Crosswhite, a longtime university official familiar with the arrangement said. Over the course of the Falwells' private training, Liberty began to pay for expensive upgrades to the facility, according to documents reviewed for this article. Eventually, in 2015, Falwell had a university executive draft a proposal for Liberty to sell the property to Crosswhite at a discount, paying him up front for Liberty\u2019s use of the facility for the next seven years.\n\n\u201cWe raised his rent some to cover the investment. LU then sold it to Ben,\u201d one senior university official said. \u201cNobody else was allowed to bid on it.\u201d\n\nIn a Dec. 10, 2013, Instagram post, Becki Falwell and Michael Cohen pose for a photograph during a visit to New York City. \"Wonderful seeing my great friend @michaelcohen84 in NY,\" Falwell wrote. \"He's the best.\" | Instagram\n\nIn a September 2015 email, Liberty University Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Randy Smith wrote Crosswhite to let him know the terms of the deal. The university would sell Crosswhite \u201cthe club and all real estate associated with it\u201d for $1,216,000. Liberty employees would be allowed to use the facility, Crosswhite could decide what the value of that was\u2014roughly $82,000 per year, he decided\u2014and the school would pay in advance for seven years of use.\n\nAt closing, per Falwell\u2019s approval, Liberty would pay Crosswhite approximately $575,000, which effectively cut Crosswhite\u2019s total cost for the $1.2 million property in half. \u201cThe net amount that you would need at closing is $641,062 more or less,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cAfter reviewing, if the terms are acceptable to you, then I will get final approval from Jerry to proceed,\u201d Smith wrote Crosswhite.\n\n\u201cHell of a deal,\u201d a former high-ranking Liberty official told me. \u201cWe gave Ben everything he asked for.\u201d\n\nIn emails obtained for this article, David Corry, lead counsel for Liberty University, expressed concerns about the appearance of the deal. \u201cPlease note, though, that Ben Crosswhite enjoys a close working relationship with several LU administrators, including the President, so I suggest whatever course of action is taken, it is done cordially and professionally with knowledge ahead of time that it may be second guessed,\u201d Corry wrote in a September 2017 email to top Liberty staff.\n\nWhen asked for comment on August 22, Corry four times asked me to turn over to him the email thread. When Corry was provided the exact wording along with the date he sent the email, he replied that he wasn\u2019t shown his \u201csignature block,\u201d perhaps suggesting he had not sent the email in question. When Corry was presented with a screen shot of his email, including his signature block, he said his comment was taken out of context and alleged the sources for this article \u201care intentionally feeding you partial facts in hopes you will do their dirty work in a very public way.\u201d On August 27, Reuters broke the news of Liberty\u2019s property sale to Crosswhite.\n\nIn a statement for this article, Falwell wrote that the athletic facility had been donated to Liberty University and was \u201ca drain on University resources that was disproportionate to its value.\u201d \u201cI wanted to reverse that and allow the University to get what it needed from the facility but eliminate the annual costs of maintenance, staffing and operations,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cSince Ben Crosswhite would not be receiving full use of the entire property\u201d given the university\u2019s continued use of the facility, Liberty decided \u201cCrosswhite never received full value of the whole property and thus should not pay full price.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless you are approaching this with some sort of pre-determined outcome, the transaction is very easy to understand,\u201d Liberty COO Smith wrote in an email responding to questions for this article. \u201cIt is VERY common practice for the university to dispose of an asset that is in financial and operational distress \u2026 especially if it can do it in a fashion that is advantageous to the university. To accomplish that while still making the facility available for the university to use is what most would consider to be a win-win situation.\u201d\n\nSmith said the idea for the financial arrangement used to sell the athletic facility to Crosswhite was his. \u201cI proposed that the university commit to renting \u2026 from him for a number of years and we could pay that in the form of a credit at closing,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cTo answer your question, yes, creative deals are commonplace at Liberty University.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I hear the laundry list of interested transactions and the questionable use of Liberty University\u2019s assets \u2026 I hear a nonprofit that is not well-governed in a sense that I would hope and expect from a sizable nonprofit,\u201d Pitt Law\u2019s Hackney said. \u201cIt has the sense of being managed for a charismatic leader and his family and friends rather than for the mission of Liberty.\u201d\n\nLiberty University graduates celebrate after the school's May 2007 commencement ceremony. | Getty Images\n\nPART III: The Power and the glory\n\nIt will surprise no one that Jerry Falwell Jr. is a Republican. He has that in common with the vast majority of people connected to Liberty. But sometimes his partisan allegiances manifest in ways that directly influence the governance of the school\u2014which, as a nonprofit, must not endorse or oppose candidates for public office.\n\nJust days after the 2008 election of Barack Obama, top university officials were already considering ways to ensure that Liberty students voted in 2010 local elections in Lynchburg. Falwell and university officials weren\u2019t simply talking about the sort of voter-registration drives common at many college campuses; they wanted students to tilt the balance of the election.\n\nIn emails obtained for this article, top school officials shared a local newspaper article documenting \u201cconcerns in some quarters [of Lynchburg] about the overwhelmingly conservative LU students and the possibility they could alter the balance of power on council and change the course of the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cFYI - The challenge we will have in 2010 is [Lynchburg\u2019s local Election Day] is finals week,\u201d a top Liberty official wrote in a November 9, 2008, email to Falwell and other school leaders. \u201cWe would either need to get a polling station at LU or try and make this a reading day to get the kids out to vote.\u201d\n\nFalwell responded to the message just under four hours later, announcing that the problem was now solved: \u201cWe changed the calendar by one week. School will now let out on May 14 instead of\" May 7.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a fluke. According to a former high-ranking university official who participated in some of these discussions, Falwell often takes \u201caggressive efforts \u2026 to register students in an effort to gain political influence.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in a 2014 email exchange, Falwell complained that Liberty\u2019s commencement date meant that most students would be gone for the summer by the time voting began for Lynchburg\u2019s local elections. \u201cWhy did we schedule commencement a week earlier this year?\u201d he wrote in an email to several school executives. When one replied that commencement usually happened during the same weekend each year, Falwell pushed back. \u201cWe need to get that corrected for the 2018 graduation or else we will have no students in town to vote in local elections again,\u201d Falwell wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s work on it.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Falwell has defended any political actions he\u2019s made as personal stances disconnected from his leadership of Liberty University. \u201cI think our community is mature enough that they understand that all the administrators and faculty have their own personal political views,\u201d he told the Washington Post after endorsing Trump. But it is as the president and chancellor of Liberty that Falwell changed the academic calendar to influence local politics.\n\nIn a statement, Falwell admitted to amending the academic calendar \u201cso that students would not be prevented from voting in local municipal elections that used to be scheduled after their spring term exams.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey and their parents pay some of the highest taxes in the nation when it comes to the City meal and hotel taxes,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair that they have some say about who is elected to represent them.\u201d\n\nWhen I shared my reporting on the school\u2019s date changes, legal experts reached different conclusions as to its propriety.\n\n\u201cThis paints a picture of an organization that is intervening on campaigns more than it should,\u201d said Pitt Law\u2019s Hackney, although he added that other universities have \u201cpresumably\u201d taken student voting into consideration when creating their schedules.\n\n\u201cDoing anything with the resources of a 501(c)(3) organization to promote or oppose candidates for elective public office is not a permitted operation by a 501(c)(3)-qualified organization under federal tax law,\u201d Borenstein, the tax attorney specializing in nonprofit organizations, wrote in an email.\n\nStill, Falwell\u2019s actions here are \u201clikely fine,\u201d said Torres-Spelliscy, the law professor at Stetson University. \u201cMany schools try to cancel classes or hold no classes on Election Day to encourage students to vote or be poll workers or engage in election protection activities. Though the IRS might consider Falwell\u2019s stated partisan motivation if the IRS investigated Liberty to challenge its 501(c)(3) status, this type of investigation is highly unlikely.\u201d In fact, according to Ellen April, a professor of tax law at Loyola Law School, a very small number of 990 Forms are ever investigated. \u201cThe IRS is able to do very little enforcement of the rules applicable to 501(c)(3) because of their limited\" resources.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Jerry Falwell Jr. onstage during Liberty's May 2017 commencement ceremony. | Getty Images\n\nObservers snickered when Donald Trump visited Liberty\u2019s campus in 2016, veered off script and infamously referred to the Bible's Second Corinthians as \u201ctwo Corinthians\u201d\u2014making it appear as if he were learning of the biblical book for the first time. But his promises to religious conservatives\u2014chief among them, his guarantee that he would fill Antonin Scalia\u2019s Supreme Court empty seat with a justice who opposed abortion rights\u2014and his choice of Mike Pence as his running mate mobilized evangelicals to support him in 2016. In CNN\u2019s exit poll from that November, 26 percent of the electorate described themselves as white born-again or evangelical Christians; 80 percent of them voted for Trump.\n\nIn 2017, with Trump in office and evangelicals strongly supporting him, the Falwells saw a branding opportunity, according to emails obtained for this article.\n\nThat spring, after Trump was invited to deliver the school\u2019s commencement address, Becki Falwell asked university counsel Corry to look into whether Liberty could \u201cpermit third-party vendors to sell t-shirts and hats [on campus] during commencement weekend.\u201d Corry advised that because of a contract between the university and Barnes & Noble, which had the exclusive right to sell \u201cclothing, including any and all such items bearing Liberty University emblem, logo, insignia, or other identifying mark\u201d on campus, the answer \u201cdepends upon who is selling them and whether Barnes & Noble consents.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that we have a lot of options available to purchase,\u201d Becki Falwell replied, adding additional Liberty officials to the email thread. \u201cIt\u2019s great advertising for Liberty to be on products with Trumps name.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up email to the Liberty officials, Becki wrote, \u201cI spoke to Michael Cohen and he said to make sure any shirts we buy are made in America! He loved the designs!\u201d\n\nThe school ended up printing and selling Trump T-shirts and hats. The shirts, in MAGA red with white type, read \u201cTRUMP\u201d in large block letters and \u201cLiberty University Commencement 2017\u201d in a much smaller font size. Another design, used on both hats and T-shirts, borrowed Trump\u2019s campaign slogan and signature style: an all-caps \u201cMaking America Great Again,\u201d then in a script font: \u201cOne degree at a time.\u201d\n\nAhead of Trump\u2019s speech at Liberty\u2019s 2017 commencement, Becki Falwell wrote an email to several high-ranking Liberty officials: \u201cIt\u2019s great advertising for Liberty to be on products with Trumps name.\u201d The school ended up printing and selling Trump t-shirts and hats. The shirts, in MAGA red with white type, read \u201cTRUMP\u201d in large block letters, with \u201cLiberty University Commencement 2017\u201d in a much smaller typeface. Another design, used on both hats and t-shirts, borrowed Trump\u2019s campaign slogan and signature style: an all-caps \u201cMaking America Great Again,\u201d then in a script font: \u201cOne degree at a time.\u201d | Obtained by Brandon Ambrosino\n\n\u201cLiberty University actually benefited by having President Donald Trump speak at commencement and by associating his brand with the University\u2019s brand,\u201d Jerry Falwell said in a statement, expressing his disappointment that the emails were shared. \u201cBecause Donald Trump is conservative, there is a benefit for a conservative Christian school to be associated with him, so long as the association does not cross the legal line set by the federal government.\u201d\n\nTold about the merchandise, experts suggested that the Trump-Liberty T-shirts might cross that line. \u201cA 501(c)(3) organization cannot be selling those shirts or gifting space to someone selling t-shirts with a candidate\u2019s name on it, since that is advertising for a candidate,\u201d Borenstein said.\n\nEver since Falwell endorsed Trump ahead of the 2016 Iowa caucuses, political pundits have speculated that Trump was simply using Falwell to achieve his own political ends. That might be true: From his regular appearances at evangelical events to his claim that he single-handedly brought back the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Trump seems to be keen on shoring up his evangelical base. What better way to do that than to cultivate a very public relationship with the late Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr.\u2019s son?\n\nBut multiple associates of Jerry Falwell Jr. said the popular narrative is backward: It\u2019s not Trump who has the most to gain from the relationship, it\u2019s Falwell. Trump just went along with the arrangement.\n\nFalwell has become known as a Trump loyalist who is willing to put his\u2014and his school\u2019s\u2014reputation on the line to defend the president from any critic. In Trump, Falwell said in 2017, \u201cevangelicals have found their dream president.\u201d When asked by the Washington Post late in 2018 if there were \u201canything President Trump could do that would endanger that support from you or other evangelical leaders,\u201d Falwell said \u201cNo.\u201d In a May 2019 tweet about the Mueller investigation, Falwell appropriated the language of reparations for descendants of slaves to argue Trump\u2019s term should be lengthened: \u201cI now support reparations. Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup.\u201d\n\nIn Trump, Falwell has found the opportunity to secure his own status as one of America\u2019s preeminent Christian political leaders\u2014the chance to finally obtain the national relevance of his father. Now, Falwell is a national figure\u2014a friend to a president, a man prone to outspoken statements that rile critics and endear him to supporters, a major leader on the religious right despite not being a pastor. He is closer than ever before to the kind of status the Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr. wielded.\n\nBut for those at Liberty who know both Falwell Jr. and his late father, there\u2019s no comparing the men.\n\nJerry\u2019sdaddy was a respectable, honest, decent, hardworking man,\u201d said a longtime Liberty official who worked for both father and son. \u201cBig Jerry hired people that were smart and capable and put them around himself. He made sure you knew you were appreciated. There was never an ego involved. You knew you were working for a higher calling. Jerry\u2019s father was very generous and promoted all of us in an enlightening way.\u201d\n\nWith Falwell Sr., \"you could feel his passion and love for the Lord and others. He knew everyone\u2019s names, their stories and struggles. He was genuine and loving. And that love bled from the campus,\u201d a former longtime university official said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold place now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith [Jerry\u2019s] dad, there were never questions about his business dealings or whether he was profiting from a business deal,\u201d said still another former longtime high-ranking Liberty official who worked closely with both men. \u201cThere was never a hint or suspicion of that because Falwell Sr. was only doing things that were for the benefit of the university or church\u2014not for himself.\u201d\n\nThe feeling is different with Junior in charge.\n\nOne source pointed to a tweet Jerry Falwell Jr. sent out in June 2019 criticizing David Platt, an evangelical Virginia pastor who apologized for welcoming Trump to his church. \u201cI only want to lead us with God\u2019s Word in a way that transcends political party and position, heals the hurts of racial division and injustice, and honors every man and woman made in the image of God,\u201d Platt said. \u201cSorry to be crude,\u201d wrote Falwell in a since-deleted tweet, \u201cbut pastors like [David Platt] need to grow a pair.\u201d\n\nAfter Falwell came under criticism for his tweet about Platt, he responded to critics with a two-part Twitter thread, which, in the words of one current high-ranking Liberty official, \u201ca lot of people found troubling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never been a minister,\u201d Falwell tweeted. \u201cUVA-trained lawyer and commercial real estate developer for 20 yrs. Univ president for last 12 years-student body tripled to 100000+/endowment from 0 to $2 billion and $1.6B new construction in those 12 years. The faculty, students and campus pastor @davidnasser of @LibertyU are the ones who keep LU strong spiritually as the best Christian univ in the world. While I am proud to be a conservative Christian, my job is to keep LU successful academically, financially and in athletics.\u201d\n\nTo those who worked for Liberty under the late Rev.
