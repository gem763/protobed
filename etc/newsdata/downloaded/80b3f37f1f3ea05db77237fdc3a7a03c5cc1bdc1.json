REUTERS/Shamil Zhumatov/File Photo\n\nItaly, the top arms exporter to Turkey last year, said it would join a ban on selling weapons and ammunition to Ankara after a weekend decision by France and Germany to suspend sales, and Spain signalled it was ready to do so.\n\nWith a host of other countries including the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden halting such exports, the EU\u2019s collective position was mainly aimed at avoiding a legally-binding embargo on Turkey, a longtime candidate to join the bloc.\n\nA full embargo would have grouped Turkey with Venezuela and Russia, countries the EU views as hostile and on whom it has a formal ban. Diplomats said ministers were not ready for an embargo despite anger at President Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cWe do not wish to support this war and do not want to make arms available,\u201d German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters.\n\nForeign ministers also agreed to draw up economic sanctions on Ankara over Turkish oil-and-gas drilling near Cyprus, although names will come at a later stage.\n\nThe Turkish government said it \u201cfully rejected and condemned\u201d the decisions taken and calls made by the EU on the two issues.\n\n\u201cWe will seriously review our cooperation with the EU on certain areas due to its unlawful and biased attitude,\u201d Turkey\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nTurkey\u2019s presidency said later that Erdogan had discussed the aims of its operations in Syria to French President Emmanuel Macron in a phone call, arguing it would contribute to regional and global peace and stability.\n\nARMS EXPORTS BAN\n\nIn their statement after a four-hour-long debate in Luxembourg, ministers agreed to \u201ccommit to strong national positions regarding their arms export policy to Turkey\u201d.\n\nVia Facebook, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said on the sidelines of the meeting: \u201cIn the next few hours, Italy too will sign a ban on the export of arms to Turkey\u201d.\n\nBelgium also said it backed stopping arms exports.\n\nThe Turkish lira slid 0.8% on Monday in the face of U.S. and European threats of sanctions, though sceptical traders said it would weaken much further if Western allies turned words into action.\n\nTurkey\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Sadik Arslan, an former Erdogan adviser, dismissed the EU measures as \u201ca joke.\u201d He told reporters: \u201cWe have enough of an industrial base to substitute them with our much better systems.\u201d\n\nThe EU exported 45 million euros ($50 million) worth of arms and ammunition to Turkey last year, including missiles, according to EU statistics office Eurostat, with Italy the main vendor, followed by Spain, Britain and Germany.\n\nSales of aircraft to Turkey, although not all military, amounted to 1.4 billion euros last year, according to Eurostat, led by France. The EU is the top foreign investor in Turkey.\n\nSpeaking in the Azeri capital of Baku, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said sanctions would not yield results.\n\nSANCTIONS ON MEDITERRANEAN DRILLING\n\nEU ministers issued a statement condemning Turkey\u2019s offensive, which aims to neutralize the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, a former U.S. ally seen by Ankara as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish insurgents in Turkey.\n\nThat statement was seen as progress for the bloc, given early resistance from Hungary. While not a major arms exporter to Turkey, Budapest is wary of doing anything to anger Erdogan, who last week warned that he would \u201copen the gates\u201d and send 3.6 million refugees to Europe if it did not back him.\n\nHungary has refused to take in people fleeing Syria\u2019s eight-year-old civil war and blocked an EU statement last week criticising Turkey, two diplomats said.\n\nEU member Cyprus and Turkey have also argued for years regarding the ownership of fossil fuels in the eastern Mediterranean, where Ankara says Turkish Cypriots are entitled to a share of the resources.\n\nTurkey has sent oil-and-gas drilling ships to waters off southern Cyprus where Greek Cypriot authorities have already awarded hydrocarbon exploration rights to Italian and French companies. Cyprus and Greece have pushed for sanctions against Ankara, diplomats said.\n\nThe EU asset freezes and travel bans are likely to target the Turkish military and captains of the drilling ships, two EU diplomats said.", "description": "European Union countries agreed on Monday to limit arms exports to Turkey over its offensive in northern Syria, prompting condemnation from Ankara, even as they stopped short of a bloc-wide embargo against a NATO ally.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440661159&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0HT", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
