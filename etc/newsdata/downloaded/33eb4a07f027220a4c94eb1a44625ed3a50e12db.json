I know I speak for many when I say enough is enough! Happily, cooler weather is on the way Friday. It\u2019ll come along with a lot of clouds. First, we\u2019ll see some showers and storms roll by into this evening.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Any showers or storms should be isolated to widely scattered. Given the high heat and humidity, any can be locally intense. In addition to the risk of briefly heavy rain and frequent lightning, there\u2019s a small chance of isolated wind damage. Rain odds wind down in the hours after dark, but clouds may remain numerous. Lows settle to the upper 60s and lower 70s. Winds turn to come out of the northeast around 5 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Friday): A wind off the ocean acts as natural air conditioning. It\u2019ll feel cool, especially after today. Highs could be as much as 20 to 25 degrees lower than this afternoon, with readings mainly heading for the low and mid-70s. Northeast winds around 10 mph keep that marine air flowing. Humidity is down, but still moderate. Not a big deal given the lower temperatures.\n\n\n\nA mix of clouds and sun on a warm summer day.

Records were set in numerous locations east of the Mississippi River as strong high pressure dominates the region.\n\n\n\nRecord and near-record highs today.
