Enjoy yourself. Be smart. We got more to go, baby.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMahomes did not look overly worried about the injury, laughing and smiling in the locker room, while, according to FOX touchline reporter Erin Andrews, he told Andy Reid, \u2018I\u2019m going to be fine, coach\u2019 at half-time.\n\nHe later posted on Twitter: \u2018Awesome team win! Love my brothers! Thank you for all the prayers! Everything looking good so far!\u2019\n\nMahomes had his leg in a brace and was limping around in the locker room, having had his kneecap popped back into place on the field by a member of the team\u2019s medical staff.\n\nWhile a full injury timeline will not be known until the Chiefs have got the MRI scans, ESPN report that the best-case scenario would be just three weeks out of action if he has not suffered ligament damage.\n\nICYMI: Mahomes in Locker Room after the game. #Chiefs pic.twitter.com/EvJQL1PF8W \u2014 Harold R.

Nobody really understood what he meant at that time and then we saw it. That\u2019s when we started panicking.
