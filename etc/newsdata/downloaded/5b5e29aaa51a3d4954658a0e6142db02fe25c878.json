Montreal's religious side was highlighted in the publication. (Laura Marchand/CBC)\n\n\"'Je me Souviens,' the motto of the province, is no meaningless phrase,\" declares the 20th page of the booklet.\n\nIt said that Montrealers kept in touch with \"the good old days\" unlike anywhere else in North America.\n\nA bustling metropolis\n\nAt the time, Montreal was Canada's largest city \u2014 the only one with a population of more than one million people \u2014 as well as the \"industrial, commercial and financial centre of the Dominion.\"\n\nBut like the rest of North America, Montreal was also reeling from the Great Depression \u2014 something that may have led to the tourism push.\n\nThe booklet recommends Montreal baseball as a \"relief to the sightseer.\" (Laura Marchand/CBC)\n\n\"[In the 1920s] Americans were really flooding into Montreal to come to drink,\" said Paul-Andr\u00e9 Linteau, professor emeritus of history with the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\n\n\"With the effect of the Depression and the end of the Prohibition, there would have been fewer Americans coming to Montreal than there used to be \u2026 I can imagine that people in the tourist industry were trying to revive that sector.\"\n\nA view of Old Montreal from \"Montreal: The Paris of the New World.\" (Laura Marchand/CBC)\n\nBaseball, bobsledding and a place for Francophiles\n\nDescribed as the place where \"history rubs shoulders with modernity,\" Montreal was hailed as both \"a city of fine buildings\" and the place for \"ancient ceremonies,\" growing from \"a lonely fort in the forests hundreds of miles from any other colonist's settlement.\"\n\nBut what were the recommended activities for a tourist in 1937?\n\nAn afternoon at the baseball park, the \"famous battle-scarred Forum\" for a hockey match or the Blue Bonnets racetrack \u2014 later named the Hippodrome de Montr\u00e9al (it closed in 2009 and was bulldozed in 2018).\n\n\"A French-Canadian audience roaring the teams to victory \u2014 or defeat \u2014 is an unforgettable experience. Don't miss it,\" the booklet said.\n\nIt also recommends the Bonsecours Market, where \"the quaint vehicles of the 'habitant'\" can still be seen. The market, located in Old Montreal, is still going strong with events, stores and restaurants.\n\nTourisme Montreal spokesperson Andr\u00e9e-Anne Pelletier looks through the old publication. (Laura Marchand/CBC)\n\nThe French connection was often played up to appeal to Americans, explained Andr\u00e9e-Anne Pelletier, a spokesperson for Tourisme Montreal.\n\nThat was partly because Montreal struggled to find an identity of its own, she said.\n\n\"We were comparing [Montreal] to big cities and like Paris. 'The Paris of the New World,' 'The Paris of North America' \u2014we notice that they were promoting the Francophone side of the city.\"\n\nIn the opening pages of the booklet \u2014 after one dedicated to hockey \u2014 is a list of parks tourists should visit.\n\nThe Mount Royal Lookout is noted as a popular spot, as well as Jeanne-Mance Park.\n\nThe booklet's take on La Fontaine Park is more downturned and calls it \"less spectacular,\" although still worthwhile.\n\nAdh\u00e9mar Raynault served as the mayor of Montreal in the late 1930s and early 1940s. (City of Montreal)\n\nAs for getting visitors to come in the winter, it praises Montreal's \"ideal winter weather in which sunshiny skies, clear invigorating air and equable temperatures mark a majority of the days.\"\n\nSkiing is recommended as \"the most exhilarating sport in the world \u2014 when you can't play golf, perhaps!\" and tobogganing, hockey and snowshoeing, among other winter sports get honourable mentions.\n\n\"Life, naturally, moves here at no slow pace,\" then-mayor Adh\u00e9mar Raynault wrote in the foreword.\n\nRaynault served as mayor from 1936 to 1938 and from 1940 to 1944.\n\n\"No matter what the tourist seeks to make his stay away from home memorable, he will find it in Montreal: historical background, thriving industry, sports, both summer and winter, gorgeous scenery, and a heart-warming hospitality,\" he said.\n\nHe also appeals to Americans by mentioning that the founders of Louisiana, New Orleans and Detroit all came from Montreal.\n\nLet's take a little trip back in time to a place once known as the \"Metropolis of Canada\" and \"The Paris of the New World.\" It's Montreal\u2014way back in the year 1937. Daybreak's Laura Marchand tells us about a strange booklet she found in a cabin, and what it tells us about how Americans would have seen Montreal. 12:12\n\nA city struggling to recover\n\nBut away from the glitz and glamour of downtown, not all was well in Montreal, according to history professor Linteau.\n\nThe cover of the booklet shouted the tagline, \"Montreal: The Paris of the New World.\" (Laura Marchand/CBC)\n\nIn 1937, the Depression, coupled with droughts on the farms out West, meant wheat exports were down, hitting the city's transportation sector, Linteau said. Meanwhile, citizens didn't have money to buy the goods Montreal manufacturers were churning out.\n\n\"There was a ripple effect in all the areas,\" Linteau said, estimating that a third of the city's population was unemployed at the height of the depression.\n\nThe City of Montreal itself was also deeply in debt, he added.\n\n\"By the end of the decade, Montreal \u2014 and Canada in general \u2014 had not completely recovered,\" he said.\n\n\"The gross domestic product [in 1939] was not even at the level it had attained 1929. So it was a very long, very difficult depression.\"\n\nBut Linteau said most tourists likely never saw that side of Montreal. The worst of it was felt in the working-class areas \u2014 far from where the booklet recommended.\n\n\"If they stayed only in the downtown area\u2026 they might have seen a bustling city.\"\n\nA view of downtown Montreal and the port in 1937, complete with the newly built Jacques Cartier Bridge in the distance. (Laura Marchand/CBC)\n\nPelletier said that, while they can't know exactly how many people came to Montreal in 1937, they do know that 18,000 tourists crossed the Quebec border in 1919.\n\nToday, that number exceeds 11 million, annually.\n\n\"The difference [today] is that Montreal is no longer just the 'Paris of the New World,'\" she said. \"Montreal has an identity... as a cultural metropolis, and the culture of Montreal is unique.\"\n\nTourism Montreal is celebrating its 100th anniversary in October.
