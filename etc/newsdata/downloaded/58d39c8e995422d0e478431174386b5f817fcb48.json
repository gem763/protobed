Arabsat had denied the pirated broadcasts were being carried by its satellites, but broadcaster beIN Sports claims it has been left billions of pounds out of pockets by the operation.\n\nAl-Obaidly had previously told Telegraph Sport that beIN could be forced to walk away from its deal with the Premier League unless the situation is resolved. Up to \u00a3650million of rights packages for UK sports - the majority of which ends up in Premier League clubs' pockets - could eventually be at \"significant risk\", he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, addressing delegates at the Leaders Week London 2019, he warned of the knock-on impacts of clubs heavily reliant on TV deals.", "description": "Bournemouth and Watford have been warned they face financial disaster if a Saudi Arabia-backed broadcaster continues to steal hundreds of millions of pounds in Premier League TV rights.", "authors": ["Tom Morgan", "Sports News Correspondent", "Jim White"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000184648842-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBWJxyI8ATefE-LyMi7SXsN8wLlaqpeJsPuEbt3760AI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
