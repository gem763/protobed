But when it did happen, when the monkey chants towards Tyrone Mings started from a section of the Bulgaria support, there could only be shock and revulsion.\n\nMings, who ought to have revelled in the thrill of wearing the England shirt for the first time, was not the only black player to be targeted. Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford also heard the disgusting noises, meaning England\u2019s victory was quickly relegated to a footnote.\n\nSofia\u2019s vile, disturbing and toxic spectacle will live long in sporting infamy | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe idea for Gareth Southgate and his players was to show their capacity to bounce back from Friday\u2019s 2-1 defeat by the Czech Republic in Prague and they did that in style. But this was an altogether different kind of psychological test in front of a crowd in which Nazi salutes were performed and the 50-strong group of black-clad ultras who were behind some of the worst abuses were ejected. The mindless minority brought shame on Bulgaria.\n\nIt was deeply distressing simply to watch, to feel the skin crawl whenever one of England\u2019s black players had the ball in anticipation of what might happen and so goodness knows how Mings, Sterling and Rashford were able to continue. After the chants had started to ring out with greater clarity, Sterling gilded the scoreline with two smart finishes. \u201cWho put the ball in the racists\u2019 net? Raheem Sterling,\u201d chanted the England support.\n\nSouthgate had made it plain he and his players would follow Uefa\u2019s three-step protocol and so they did. First, there was an announcement over the PA system to urge the chants to stop and, when they did not, the referee, Ivan Bebek, halted the game just before the interval and asked Southgate whether he wanted to take his players off to the dressing room.\n\nSouthgate said he wanted to get to half-time, talk to the players and take stock. There was the option for England not to return but, according to the Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, the players wanted to resume; they did not want the racists to win.\n\nPlay Video 0:55 Bulgaria v England Euro 2020 qualifier halted after racist chanting by home fans \u2013 video\n\nEngland\u2019s last visit to this stadium in 2011 for a European qualifier had been scarred by monkey chants towards Ashley Cole, Ashley Young and Theo Walcott. So much for the progress the Bulgarian Football Union president, Borislav Mihaylov, had trumpeted last week. After half-time, there were more audible monkey chants but England were able to battle on. They wanted to battle on.\n\nThe one hope had been for nothing unsavoury to happen but with tensions simmering in a half-empty stadium \u2013 and sounds carrying \u2013 that hope quickly disintegrated.\n\nMings heard the abuse during the warm-up but there were 24 minutes on the clock when Harry Kane, the England captain, began a conversation with Bebek \u2013 in line with Uefa\u2019s protocol \u2013 and Southgate did likewise with the Uefa official on the sideline. Moments later, an announcer pleaded for the chants to stop or the game would \u201cbe suspended and may be abandoned\u201d.\n\nIt was not difficult to pick out the monkey chants after Mings had played a pass out of defence and it was clear the England debutant had heard them because he turned towards a section of the crowd, stood still for a moment and stared.\n\nThe stadium holds 44,000 but the capacity was reduced by 5,000 as a punishment by Uefa for the behaviour of the Bulgaria support in the June qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Kosovo, which was ruled to have been racist. The cordoned off area behind one of the goals was adorned by anti-racism banners. But there were further large swathes of empty seats, giving a curious backdrop to the spectacle.\n\nFrom the moment Mings effectively confronted the home fans, the game ceased to be a spectacle. It was horribly edgy. At that point, England were 2-0 up and playing well, even though the action came to feel incidental.\n\nBulgaria v England: Euro 2020 qualifier \u2013 live! Read more\n\nRashford scored the opener with a fizzing shot from an angle and the second was laid on by Sterling, who swapped passes with Kane and crossed for Ross Barkley to tap home. The England fans directed a bellowed chant to their Bulgarian rivals. \u201cYou racist bastards, you know what you are.\u201d\n\nMings heard further taunts on at least two occasions before half-time and the only wonder was that the England players did not leave the pitch. During the stoppage in the 41st minute, the Bulgaria captain, Ivelin Popov, appeared to urge the home fans to calm down. England scored twice more before half-time and it was a pity their imposing football rang so hollow. Kane picked out Barkley to head past Plamen Iliev, while Kieran Trippier and Kane ushered in Sterling. By then, onlookers were wondering how much worse the situation would get and whether the game would finish.\n\nEngland were quite prepared to walk off in the second half and they might have done so because there were further racist chants. It was, according to Southgate, an impossible situation. Sterling took his second goal nicely, Kane rounded off the rout with the sixth and it would have been double figures but for Iliev\u2019s resistance. The only mercy was the full-time whistle.", "description": "Racist abuse marred England\u2019s 6-0 Euro 2020 qualifying win in Sofia in which Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling both scored twice", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb288c53b69ab5b9e19c746344318e94c14c7e6f/0_96_2484_1490/master/2484.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e16115dcb7e7e065e500db253066f95c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
