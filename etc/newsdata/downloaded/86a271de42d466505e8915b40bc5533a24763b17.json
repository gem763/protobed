(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe fallout from Rockets GM Daryl Morey's pro-Hong Kong tweet continued, as LeBron James shared his feelings about the situation. USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken says it was the most disgraceful moment of LBJ's career. It's too early to know whether LeBron's comments will hurt his image or bottom line, but some experts believe the controversy will be short-lived. And commissioner Adam Silver revealed later that the Chinese government asked him to fire Morey. Silver's response? No way.\n\nLittle guy, big bat\n\nJose Altuve celebrates his walk-off home run with Justin Verlander. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Houston Astros are in the World Series for the second time in three years thanks to Jose Altuve, who launched a walk-off homer late Saturday night off Aroldis Chapman to defeat the New York Yankees in Game 6 of the ALCS.\n\nThe moment proved that Altuve is \"everything that's right about the Astros.\"\n\nWhile Houston revels in another pennant, the Bronx Bombers are forced to reckon with a historic failure for their franchise: the Yankees did not win a pennant in the 2010s, the first time they have not advanced to the World Series in a decade since the 1910s.\n\nThe Talkers: Quick reads you need\n\nBryce Harper is totally not upset\n\nThe Washington Nationals celebrate after winning the National League pennant. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Astros' opponent in the World Series is the Washington Nationals, just as no one predicted. Last season, Washington let superstar outfielder Bryce Harper walk, and he signed with the division-rival Phillies. Harper, who is now quite the villain in D.C., says he's happy for his former team.\n\n\"I\u2019m so happy for them. You know how hard it is to get into the postseason and win games. For them to be able to put it together this year the way they have, it\u2019s an amazing thing.\"\n\nFor the Nationals, Tuesday's series-sweeping win vs. the Cardinals was a moment of celebration. Not only are the Nats in the World Series for the first time in their franchise history, this is the first D.C. baseball team by any name to make the Fall Classic since 1933.\n\nGet ready to hear a lot of \"Baby Shark.\"\n\n#EQUALPAY\n\nA girls soccer team in Vermont is on a mission. The Burlington Seahorses are making a stand for pay equity, joining the World Cup-winning U.S. women's national soccer team in advocating for gender equality. They've been spreading the #EQUALPAY message, and on Friday, following a goal, several girls removed their jerseys to reveal T-shirts with #EQUALPAY emblazoned on them. The players got a yellow card, but it seems that it was worth it.\n\nNFL MVP gets major scare\n\nKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes lays on the turf following an injury in the second quarter against the Denver Broncos.

So imagine how Chiefs fans felt watching Mahomes go down with a knee injury Thursday in Denver. Mahomes underwent an MRI on Friday, and it appears that the star QB should only miss three to four weeks with a dislocated kneecap.\n\nPickle juice, anyone?\n\nDallas Cowboys wide receiver Amari Cooper catches the game-winning pass in overtime against the Philadelphia Eagles in their 2018 matchup.

So why not relive the nine best Eagles-Cowboys games?!

(Photo: Vasha Hunt, AP)\n\nAnother strange day in college football \u2013 No. 6 Wisconsin lost at Illinois, somehow \u2013 ended with the nation's No. 1 team holding its breath as star Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was knocked out of the Crimson Tide's game against rival Tennessee with an ankle injury.\n\nEarly returns say he should be back for the LSU game at the beginning of November, but no doubt college football fans across the nation will have their eyes peeled for updates on the Heisman contender.\n\nHere are the other highlights from Week 8:\n\nR.I.P.
