She campaigned for Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts during his 2004 presidential run and was among the chorus of celebrities to speak out against President George W. Bush. She has talked openly about her anxiety disorder, revealed on her podcast that she had two abortions in her 20s and might say she\u2019s not above using her celebrity for the good of a cause \u2014 once leaking a \u201csex tape\u201d of herself that was actually a video about the bloodshed in Syria.\n\n\u201cThere could be a new cause tonight,\u201d joked her husband of a decade, the talent agent David Bugliari.\n\nShe says that\u2019s exactly right \u2014 she is \u201cmulti-issue focused,\u201d particularly right now, when there\u2019s \u201cso much to fight for.\u201d\n\nBut it was #MeToo that galvanized her. Lying in bed late one night, about a week after the revelations about Harvey Weinstein hit, she was encouraged by a friend \u2014 the transgender activist Charlotte Clymer \u2014 to send a tweet: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write \u2018me too\u2019 as a reply to this tweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI closed my computer, went to sleep, and woke up to 35,000 replies,\u201d Ms. Milano said .\n\nThe rest of the story we now know: The hashtag went viral. Terms like \u201creckoning\u201d were used by the media to describe the cultural ricochet. Tarana Burke, the activist who founded the MeToo movement in 2006, and Ms. Milano soon met \u2014 the actress did not know about Ms. Burke\u2019s work at the time of her tweet \u2014 and were named, alongside other influencers, Time\u2019s person of the year (dubbed \u201cThe Silence Breakers\u201d).\n\nSince then, it\u2019s been a pretty consistent staccato of Ms. Milano\u2019s topknot popping up where you least expect it: As a background fixture to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 \u201cI could see the sweat on the back of his neck,\u201d she said \u2014 which was later parodied on an episode of Saturday Night Live with her depicted as a cardboard cutout.\n\n\u201cYou just want to humiliate me in front of my wife and my parents and Alyssa frickin\u2019 Milano!\u201d Matt Damon, playing Kavanaugh, exclaims.", "description": "The actress is trying to stay just famous enough to still get invited to Washington.", "authors": ["Jessica Bennett"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/fashion/00milanoa/00milanoa-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
