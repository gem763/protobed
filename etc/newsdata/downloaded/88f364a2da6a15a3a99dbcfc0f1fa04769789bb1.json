The accord was also meant to mark a thaw in decades of cool relations between the two neighbors.\n\nBut the gas never started flowing as complications arose surrounding the pipeline connecting the two countries and other aspects of the deal. Israeli officials blame bureaucratic setbacks at home for the delay and say the project could start as early as January. Egyptian officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nA man passes by the site of a militant attack on a gas pipeline outside Egypt\u2019s northern Sinai town of Al Arish in 2012.

Cairo aims to liquefy Israeli and other natural gas and re-export it to Europe or sell it domestically.\n\nAnalysts and people close to the project point to other obstacles, including security concerns.\n\nTroubled Link Israel and Egypt plan to revive use of an existing natural-gas pipeline between the two countries whose overland portion in the Sinai Desert has been attacked by militants.

The group claims to have killed more than 300 people in Egypt during the first half of 2019, including numerous attacks on military convoys in North Sinai.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t protect themselves and their own infrastructure, it will be a struggle for them to protect this gas-line infrastructure,\u201d said Zack Gold, an expert on the Sinai insurgency at CNA, a security consulting firm that works with the U.S. government.\n\nSecurity forces and other mourners carried a coffin containing the body of an Egyptian military officer killed in a clash with militants in North Sinai, during his funeral in Cairo in February.

Join the conversation below.\n\nThailand\u2019s state-owned PTT Energy Resources Co., a stakeholder in the pipeline operator, Eastern Mediterranean Gas Co., is suing Egypt in a Cairo court, saying it was deprived of revenue when the gas stopped flowing. The lawsuit names Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, other Egyptian officials, and Egypt\u2019s state oil-and-gas companies. A trial is set to begin on Tuesday.\n\nThe suit could result in years of litigation, drawing continued attention to the collapse of the previous gas deal. In that agreement, Egypt agreed in 2005 to sell $2.5 billion worth of gas to Israel over the same pipeline.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi is named in a Thai lawsuit seeking damages for a failed Egyptian-Israeli gas deal.

In 2012, a former Egyptian oil minister, a former chairman of the state gas company and a prominent businessman were all sentenced to jail terms for squandering public funds in the deal. It also stirred opposition from Egyptians who remain skeptical about their country\u2019s ties with Israel.\n\nEgyptian officials have said they wouldn\u2019t import gas from Israel until they resolved international arbitration cases stemming from the 2012 shutdown. But an Eastern Mediterranean Gas executive said the litigation can\u2019t legally jeopardize the flow of gas. Israel\u2019s energy minister Yuval Steinitz also said he doesn\u2019t expect the Thai lawsuit to pose a significant obstacle.\n\nIsrael and Egypt now plan to test the pipeline this month, with commercially available gas flowing in January, according to Israel\u2019s energy minister and an Egyptian energy executive.\n\n\u201cThere were some bureaucratic delays, but I think most of them are already over by now,\u201d Mr. Steinitz said.\n\nAn Egyptian security official took position on a sand dune during an operation in the northern Sinai Peninsula in 2012.
