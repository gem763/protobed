REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\n\nHELSINKI (Reuters) - It is better to be safe than sorry before shifting the policy gear back to normalisation, Finnish policymaker Olli Rehn said on Thursday, in defence of the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to raise stimulus.\n\nThe ECB eased its monetary policy further last month to lift growth and inflation, a divisive decision which has sparked an unusual public spat between the majority doves, with Rehn among them, and more conservative policymakers from the north of the euro zone.\n\n\u201cAs long as the synchronized slowdown continues, there is no economically meaningful alternative to unconventional monetary policies \u2013 and it is better to be safe than sorry before shifting the policy gear back to normalization,\u201d Rehn said at an economic policy panel in Helsinki.\n\nHe dismissed arguments that there would have not been danger of a deflationary spiral previously in the euro area.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the European Commission in 2013-14 was very concerned about the spectre of deflation, and expressed that also publicly,\u201d said Rehn, who was the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro between 2010 and 2014.\n\nRehn repeated his previous warning that \u201cthe declining inflation expectations can become permanently stuck at low levels,\u201d similar to what has happened in Japan. [L5N26O1NY]\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in the midst of a deflationary spiral until we take action. This is also one of the key lessons of the Japanese experience,\u201d he said.", "description": "It is better to be safe than sorry before shifting the policy gear back to normalisation, Finnish policymaker Olli Rehn said on Thursday, in defence of the European Central Bank's decision to raise stimulus.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439298052&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991G1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
