After thousands of people were killed in the decades-long conflict between Turkey and the PKK, Erdogan vowed to stem the Kurdish influence near his border.\n\nDetails of the phone call are not public; however, the White House claimed Trump did not approve of Erdogan's military campaign to confront Kurdish forces in Syria. According to an Axios report, sources close to the White House said Erdogan finally called Trump's bluff and embarked on his incursion into Syria.\n\nRead more: The general who led the fight against ISIS says Trump's new policy 'breaks that trust' after years of hard fighting\n\nErdogan, who faces increasing domestic pressure amid a flailing economy, received the symbolic green light to do just that as Trump withdrew about two dozen US special operations forces from the immediate area of the invasion. Trump eventually followed up by withdrawing an additional 1,000 troops from the country, leaving a small undisclosed number of them stationed near Syria's border with Iraq.\n\nNumerous reports of atrocities followed newsbreaks from Turkey's assault. At least a dozen Kurds, including a female politician, were killed, according to Foreign Policy.\n\nThe perpetrators are not limited to Turkish forces. In addition to pressure from Turkey, the Kurds are under assault by the Free Syrian Army, a Turkish-backed militia that is killing civilians and freeing ISIS prisoners who were detained by the Kurds, according to Foreign Policy.", "description": "The Islamic State, Russia, Iran, and Syria are all poised to strengthen their positions amid the chaos triggered by Trump's abrupt withdrawal.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_4O2y8VwXf7wNhHxWTerow--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/67e58240c17cd115bd4fe71786043223", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
