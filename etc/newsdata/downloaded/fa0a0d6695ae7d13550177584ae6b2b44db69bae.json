We also know many of its words. We are approaching the moment when the great dictionaries pick those that sum up our times, following on from last year\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary), \u201cjustice\u201d (Merriam Webster) \u201csingle use\u201d (Collins) and \u201cme too\u201d (Macquarie). The words might not have been coined in 2019, but will have acquired new meaning, risen to prominence, or somehow distil our preoccupations. In advance of the lexicographers\u2019 big reveal, here are my top 10 candidates.\n\nPeople\n\nA pretty ordinary word \u2013 and one with a long history (its origins are murky once you get past Latin, where populus meant a community or nation). But the way the idea of \u201cthe people\u201d has been used over the past year, often cynically, makes it thoroughly contemporary. Supporters of Brexit constantly invoke the \u201cwill\u201d of the people, likening the nation to an individual with desires and motives. Their opponents agitate for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Trump makes it a proper noun: \u201cI am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People.\u201d Back in Britain we nervously await a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, with Boris Johnson eager to paint MPs who oppose his strategy as anti-democrats at odds with the popular mood.\n\nProrogue\n\nLike one of the aged vellum documents stowed in parliament\u2019s Victoria tower, this word was unfurled in August to widespread incomprehension. But it is an important part of the creaking apparatus of the British constitution and refers to the act of ending a parliamentary session. It comes from the Latin verb to extend and contains the element rogare (to ask). As it turned out, there wasn\u2019t much asking involved \u2013 Johnson\u2019s government, in the vampiric form of Jacob Rees-Mogg, told the Queen that parliament needed to be suspended and she complied. But, as the supreme court concluded, this instruction was unlawful. As MPs re-entered the chamber on 25 September, the only trace of the prorogation was the imprint of its lugubrious syllables in our minds.\n\nFemtech\n\nStartup culture hasn\u2019t always seemed like the most welcoming place for women, so the idea of femtech might seem like a breath of fresh air. Investment in digital technology designed to improve women\u2019s health and wellbeing \u2013 like Bluetooth enabled pelvic-floor training devices or fertility apps \u2013 has been steadily building. In the first quarter of 2019, $241m (\u00a3190m) was ploughed into femtech companies, leading some to predict the sector\u2019s first billion-dollar year. But the term isn\u2019t without controversy. \u201cWhen it\u2019s about men and men\u2019s health, it\u2019s not mentech, right?\u201d one analyst recently told the BBC. \u201cWelcome to the world of 21st-century technological advancements, where brand new innovations give us the chance to \u2026 create exactly the same stupid sexist divides all over again,\u201d wrote Quartz\u2019s Olivia Goldhill. It\u2019s a good question: why are products aimed at half the population deemed niche?\n\nSadfishing\n\nOne of those rare words whose origin can be precisely pinpointed to an opinion piece \u2013 in Metro in January. \u201cSadfishing,\u201d wrote Rebecca Reid, \u201cis when someone uses their emotional problems to hook an audience on the internet\u201d. She was attacking an Instagram post by Kris Jenner that teased followers with the promise of a confession about some personal trauma: in fact, it was a marketing campaign for a skincare range. Sadfishing roared back into the news in September after a report commissioned by British headteachers suggested children who posted about their problems on social media were having the word thrown at them by bullies. It takes its place next to a series of terms relating to online behaviour that uses the suffix \u201cfishing\u201d, including blackfishing and catfishing.\n\nOpioid\n\nSynthetic molecules that mimic the effects of natural opiates \u2013 chemicals derived from the opium poppy \u2013 are called opioids and they include now-familiar names such as oxycodone and fentanyl. They can be 100 times stronger than morphine and have rarely been out of the news in 2019 because of an explosion in the number of people killed by them, particularly in the US. Fatal overdoses now occur at a rate of 130 a day, making the \u201copioid crisis\u201d or \u201copioid epidemic\u201d America\u2019s great contemporary public health crisis. It has also led to the fall of one of its richest families \u2013 the Sacklers, whose company Purdue Pharma produced OxyContin. Use of the search term \u201copioid\u201d spiked in August, when Purdue agreed to settle lawsuits against it to the tune of $10-$12bn.\n\nPronoun\n\nPreviously an innocuous piece of linguistic plumbing, the pronoun \u2013 a grammatical device used to refer back to a noun you have already mentioned \u2013 is having a moment. The word itself has become a signifier of the new gender politics: it is now not unusual to see the note \u201cpronouns: he/him\u201d or \u201cshe/her\u201d alongside job title and address at the end of emails or on social media profiles. In September, the singer Sam Smith told his Instagram followers \u201cMy pronouns are they/them\u201d, adding: \u201cAfter a lifetime of being at war with my gender, I\u2019ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out.\u201d The use of \u201cthey\u201d to refer to a singular noun, although it has a long history, has traditionally been discouraged by grammarians. The most recent edition of the famed Chicago Manual of Style, however, says: \u201cWhen referring specifically to a person who does not identify with a gender-specific pronoun ... they and its forms are often preferred.\u201d\n\nWoke\n\nWoke, meaning \u201cwell-informed\u201d, first appeared in print in a glossary of \u201cwords you might hear in Harlem\u201d in 1962. It finally entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017, with the definition \u201calert to racial or social discrimination and injustice\u201d. So what makes it a potential word of the year 2019? Put simply, woke has gone mainstream and in doing so has been subject to a bizarre transformation. At the end of 2018, African American broadcaster Sam Sanders made a plea \u201cto put woke to sleep\u201d. He argued that any authenticity it once had was being lost due to overuse by white liberals, leading to its co-option by businesses keen to burnish their progressive credentials \u2013 so-called \u201cwokewashing\u201d \u2013 and ultimately to a backlash. A new ironic use of woke has exploded and two books published this year exemplify the boomerang effect: Woke by comedian Andrew Doyle, writing as the PC parody Titania McGrath and Anti-Woke by professional contrarian Brendan O\u2019Neill. Woke is dead; \u201cwoke\u201d is alive and kicking.\n\nNanoinfluencer\n\nOver the past few years a new economy has sprung up, its workers \u201crelatable\u201d personalities who are ostensibly letting you peek into their private lives, its products whatever they pose with on Instagram. It has proved fertile ground for new words, including \u201cinfluencer\u201d for the people involved and \u201csponcon\u201d, for sponsored content they post (a label seen more frequently since watchdogs cracked down on stealth ads in 2017). Subcategories of influencer have been delineated: the \u201cunfluencer\u201d, the \u201coutfluencer\u201d the \u201cmicroinfluencer\u201d. The latest is nanoinfluencer \u2013 someone who may have only a thousand or so followers. They are supposed to be like you and me (and their endorsements come cheap for the brands that target them). As the digital economy penetrates deeper, some people you know might already fall into this category: maybe next year, you will too.\n\nCancelled\n\nThe fear that most preoccupies modern-day public figures is that of cancellation: being dumped in the basket of deplorables after a trial by a jury of millions of strangers. Notable cancellees this year included the beauty YouTuber James Charles, whose followers turned against him for reasons too arcane for most outsiders to understand, and Justin Trudeau, whose offences in blackface are a bit easier to discern. Redemption can only be achieved through (ideally multiple rounds of) rehab, as satirised by Lolly Adefope in this year\u2019s BBC comedy short Sorry, in which an imperious actress on the brink of superstardom is felled by a 12-year-old tweet. If you are concerned about your own status, a new website, Am I Cancelled?, uses an algorithm to determine whether you are still fit to show your face on social media.\n\nCrisis\n\nEvery age has predicted that the end of the world is nigh. But it increasingly feels as though inhabitants of early-21st century Earth may be on to something. From the environmental to the political and the economic, our times are defined by a worsening of conditions to the point of emergency. This year Britain and the US\u2019s serial constitutional crises have dominated the news, but a far bigger catastrophe, the climate crisis, has begun to seem more and more real, too. In May, the Guardian changed the language it uses to describe the situation, preferring climate crisis or breakdown to the less-urgent seeming climate change. In some of its earliest-recorded uses, the word referred to a \u201cturning point in a disease, that change which indicates recovery or death\u201d. It remains to be seen what course our own crisis will take.\n\nDavid Shariatmadari is the author of Don\u2019t Believe a Word: The Surprising Truth About Language", "description": "From people becoming a proper noun to woke\u2019s use as an insult, we pick our key words of the year", "authors": ["David Shariatmadari"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917bbf561f0afb01fd1ab81bf278c56c8737c0e6/2_0_8885_5333/master/8885.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7fcf1e66907e974206a11f810a5d07db", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
