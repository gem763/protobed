When those students graduate, they pay the college a certain percentage of their future income.\n\nIt\u2019s a way \u201cfor the school to say to students, \u2018You\u2019re only going to pay us if we help you succeed\u2019,\u201d explains Beth Akers, co-author of the book \u201cGame of Loans.\u201d\n\nAndrew Hoyler was thrilled when Purdue University got him an ISA loan. Now he\u2019s a professional pilot, and he\u2019ll pay Purdue 8% of his income for 104 months.\n\n\u201cAfter that 104-month term ends, if you still owe money, it\u2019s forgiven, forgotten, you don\u2019t owe another penny,\u201d he says in my latest video. \u201cNow, if I find myself in a six-figure job tomorrow, there\u2019s a chance that I\u2019ll pay back far more than I took out.\u201d\n\nCOLLEGE DEBT IS THE HIGHEST IN ONE VERY SPECIFIC REGION\n\nHoyler wouldn\u2019t mind that, he says, because of \u201cthe security of knowing that I\u2019ll never (have to) pay back more than I can afford.\u201d\n\nWhat students pay depends partly on what they study.\n\nOn a $10,000 ISA, English majors must pay 4.58% of their income for 116 months. Math majors, because they are more likely to get higher-paying jobs, pay just 3.96% for 96 months.\n\n\u201cIt conveys information to the student about how lucrative a different major\u2019s going to be,\u201d says Akers. \u201cSome think that\u2019s unfair, but really that\u2019s just a way (investors) can recapture the money that they\u2019ve put up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may also sway students away from majors that don\u2019t have job prospects,\u201d says Hoyler. ISA recipients learn \u201cnot only what a career may pay, but how stable it may be, what the future is like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should invest in students the same way that we invest in startups,\u201c says Akers. \u201cShare equity.\u201d\n\nWith one difference: The college picks the student, so investors don\u2019t have a direct relationship with the student.\n\nPurdue ISA recipient Paul Larora told me, \u201cWe don\u2019t know who the investor is, but I\u2019d love to give him a hug or buy him a beer!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe institutions are saying, \u2018If I\u2019m operating as the middleman, I can make sure that no one\u2019s taking advantage of my students,\u2019\u201d explains Akers.\n\nSadly, many politicians would rather have the government handle student loans and charge all students the same rate.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed a student debt relief bill that he claimed would \u201ccut out private middlemen,\u201d meaning banks. He said that \u201cwould save taxpayers $68 billion!\u201d It didn\u2019t. Costs to taxpayers increased.\n\nSome politicians are so clueless that they still blame banks.\n\nIn one hearing, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chair of the House Financial Services Committee, demanded JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon tell her, \u201cWhat are you guys doing to help us with this student loan debt?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stopped doing all student lending,\u201d responded Dimon, pointing out that \u201cthe government took over student lending in 2010.\u201d\n\nInstead of forcing banks out of the loan business, we should get government out of it. Banks are in the business of assessing loan risk.\n\nIf actual private lenders, people with skin in the game, made loans, then they\u2019d care about being paid back.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThey\u2019d tell students which majors might lead to higher-paying careers and warn them that studying sociology, art history or gender studies may make it tough to get out of debt.\n\nBut with the government charging the same rate to everyone, students don\u2019t have much incentive to think about that.\n\nThe Brookings Institution found that 28% of students don\u2019t even know they have a loan.\n\nThe market would make better judgments and stop students from starting their adult lives under a burden they may never escape.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nYet some people still call ISAs \u201cpredatory\u201d because investors hope for profit. They say ISA makes students \u201cindentured servants.\u201d\n\nLarora had a good answer to that, which is also serious advice: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a job, you\u2019re not paying anything! Where\u2019s the servitude in that?\u201d", "description": "Student loan debt keeps growing.
