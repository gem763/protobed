(Rick Wilking/Reuters)\n\nHillary Clinton said that Donald Trump is an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d during a Wednesday appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nThe former presidential candidate made the comment after host Joy Behar asked what she made of Trump leading \u201clock her up!\u201d chants at campaign rallies.\n\n\u201cI do think that [Trump] knows that he\u2019s an illegitimate president,\u201d said Clinton to applause from the studio audience. \u201cBecause of that, he\u2019s very insecure about it.\u201d\n\n\"He knows that he\u2019s an illegitimate president and because of that \u2014 he\u2019s very insecure about it.\" \u2014@HillaryClinton on @realDonaldTrump \"He's obsessed with the fact that he was helped a lot,\" in 2016. pic.twitter.com/jxlj6UePyf \u2014 Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 2, 2019\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign met with harsh public backlash after she was accused of using a private home server to receive classified emails from the State Department in violation of federal laws governing the handling of classified information. After an F.B.I. investigation, then director James Comey announced that the agency would not press charges against Clinton, but referred to her actions as \u201cextremely careless.\u201d\n\nThe investigation into her use of a private server for classified emails became a key issue in the 2016 elections, with Trump and supporters shouting \u201clock her up!\u201d at rallies and alleging that Clinton had overstepped the bounds of the law.\n\nThe State Department is continuing its own investigation into the matter.\n\nDuring the 2016 election season, Trump hinted that he would not accept the election results if he were to lose. Clinton herself went on to question the legitimacy of the results in a 2017 interview with in Mother Jones.\n\nLater in the Wednesday interview, Clinton accused Trump of \u201cbeing helped a lot\u201d in the 2016 elections, presumably referring to the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to sway the election in his favor.\n\nTrump has been fighting accusations that his campaign conspired with Russian government officials to obtain dirt on Clinton, which allegedly helped him to become president.\n\nThe allegations that Trump colluded with Russian operatives touched off a nearly two-year FBI counterintelligence operation into the Trump campaign. The probe began after the FBI received reports from the Australian government that a Trump campaign official, George Papadopoulos, had bragged to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that the campaign had obtained incriminating documents on Hillary Clinton from Russian intelligence.\n\nAn investigation into the matter by special counsel Robert Mueller cleared the Trump campaign of colluding with Russian operatives.\n\nIn May of this year, Trump tasked U.S. Attorney General William Barr with looking into the origins of the Mueller report. It was revealed on Monday that Barr had asked Trump to request aid from the Australian government pertaining to Barr\u2019s investigation. Australian ambassador to the U.S. Joe Hockey had also offered to aid the investigation in May.", "description": "Hillary Clinton said that Donald Trump is an \"illegitimate president\" during a Wednesday appearance on ABC's \"The View.\"", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
