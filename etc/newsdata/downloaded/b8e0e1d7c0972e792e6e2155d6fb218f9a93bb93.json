On top of that, she wants to keep the kid which I am very against.\n\n\"She\u2019s very f***ing ecstatic which shocked me cause obviously she\u2019s against having kids too.\n\n\"I feel so damn betrayed in this situation, she knows I\u2019m very against kids.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"I really don\u2019t want to have a kid. So much so that I\u2019m thinking of divorcing her if she\u2019s not willing to get rid of it, and to be honest I might divorce her anyways cause of the crap she pulled with the birth control.\n\n\"Would I be the a**hole for possibly divorcing her over this, or asking her to get an abortion?\"\n\nThe post has attracted a huge amount of comments, with many users telling him his has every right to leave his wife but can't dictate what she does with the baby.\n\nOne says: \"This is a pretty life-changing level of deceit on your wife's part and doesn't say much for her or her character, honestly.\n\n\"Obviously the choice is ultimately hers regarding the baby. But the choice regarding the future of the relationship belongs to both of you.\"\n\nAnother says: \"Not the a**hole. She seems to have tricked you into becoming a dad.\"", "description": "He says he feels 'betrayed' as the two had a long-standing agreement not to have children", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16665359.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Couple-having-a-quarrel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
