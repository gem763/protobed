Guilt-free forage or enough to put you off your dinner?\n\nDeer oh deer: is Janet Street-Porter right to eat roadkill?\n\nName: Janet Street-Porter.\n\nAge: 72.\n\nAppearance: Striking.\n\nI know who you mean. There\u2019s only one Janet Street-Porter. But what a varied CV: producer, editor, author, broadcaster, journalist \u2026\n\nI\u2019m aware \u2026 committed rambler, roadkill enthusiast, Loose Women regular \u2026\n\nWait. What was that? You know, that ITV daytime show; they talk about the royals, cellulite, that kind of thing.\n\nNo, before that: roadkill enthusiast?! Indeed.\n\nYou mean she enjoys hitting animals with her car? No, but if someone else happens to, she gets pretty excited.\n\nWhy? Because it means supper is sorted.\n\nI am not sure I would have much of an appetite after seeing a dead animal. Street-Porter is made of stronger stuff, as she has explained to her fellow Loose Women.\n\nShe did not. She said: \u201cIf you see a deer by the side of the road that\u2019s been hit by a lorry or another car, what are you gonna do?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going to not eat it. \u201cVenison is a free-range meat that lives on grain and I think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s very healthy,\u201d she added.\n\nWhat did the other Loose Women think? They were shocked, but they shouldn\u2019t have been. Street-Porter had previously revealed her diet in a newspaper column in June. \u201cI\u2019m a convert to roadkill cuisine,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand I can\u2019t wait to try the deer I found on the A1.\u201d\n\nHow do you even cook a dead deer? Don\u2019t you have to get its outside off first? According to Street-Porter, her partner found a tutorial on YouTube.\n\nCan you name any other roadkill-eating celebrities? It\u2019s not as common as you might think.\n\nI didn\u2019t imagine it was very common at all. In that case it\u2019s exactly as common as you think: wildlife presenter Chris Packham collects roadkill, but only to feed to foxes; Phillip Schofield once ate a road-killed fox on This Morning, but there\u2019s no suggestion he\u2019s stuck with the practice.\n\nNot quite a trend, then. Not yet, but roadkill is considered by many to be a guilt-free addition to an otherwise vegan diet.\n\nWhat else is good, besides deer and foxes? Pheasant, squirrel, hedgehog, weasel, badger - it\u2019s all fair game, as long as it was dead when you got there.\n\nDo say: \u201cHere\u2019s a little delicacy from my favourite stretch of the M6.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say: \u201cCould you do me a favour and run over this hedgehog for me?\u201d", "description": "The Loose Women regular has revealed a taste for animals found by the side of the road.
