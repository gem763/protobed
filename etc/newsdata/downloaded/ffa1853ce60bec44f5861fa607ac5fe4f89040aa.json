These will be turned into \u201cagro-forests\u201d under the control of international companies including Olam Cocoa and Siat. National parks and forests that are considered relatively intact will remain protected, according to the law, while a middle category will be gradually restored.\n\nCampaigners say it is crucial to preserve the remaining parts of these already ravaged forests. \u201cWe are opposed to further deforestation of these areas,\u201d said Youssouf Doumbia, president of the Ivorian Observatory for the Sustainable Management of Natural Resources, a civil society organisation consulted on the proposals.\n\n\u201cPoliticians have authorised the construction of infrastructure in these agro-forests \u2013 but if we do that, it\u2019s an open door for the pure and simple disappearance of our forests. They will be wiped out.\u201d\n\nThere are fears that the process will result in a loss of property rights for indigenous communities and create a monopoly for foreign companies in what is the world\u2019s largest cocoa producing nation. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk of a massive land grab situation,\u201d said Julia Christian, forest campaigner at Fern, a Brussels-based organisation working with cocoa growers. \u201cThey\u2019re lands currently run by independent, small-scale farmers \u2013 but it\u2019s going to become a monopoly with companies given exclusive rights to buy cacao.\u201d\n\nThe purported aim of the government is to protect other forests by improving cocoa farming productivity in already deforested areas. Research has found that the least productive quarter of farms in the Ivory Coast had yields four times smaller than the most productive, usually due to diseases and pests.\n\nBy giving excessive power to industrial companies in concessions that will last up to 24 years, however, campaigners say that farmers will be disempowered. \u201cThis law is a good opportunity in principle,\u201d said Gerome Tokpa, Africa lead for the Earthworm Foundation. \u201cWe could improve efficiency and give power to the local farmers. The problem is that the customary landowners who are trying to preserve the forest in alignment [with] the law will be punished. So much money is being earned, but nothing is coming down.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cocoa farming accounts for 10% of the the Ivory Coast\u2019s GDP, but this comes at a huge cost to its forests.

According to Fern, growers receive only 6% of a chocolate bar\u2019s sale price compared with the 80% taken by manufacturers and retailers. The Ivory Coast has repeatedly struggled to establish a price floor for cocoa produce.\n\nTraor\u00e9 Ousmane, a 41-year-old cocoa farmer and workers\u2019 cooperative member in western Ivory Coast, doubted that working conditions would improve. \u201cWe simply aren\u2019t paid enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to have a minimum price for producers because these companies do not care about us. They are looking to maximise profits.\u201d\n\nCritics have also lambasted the decision to forcibly evict all occupants of protected forests, who could number up to a million, as part of the law. Around 40% of the country\u2019s cocoa crop is grown illegally in national parks and 230 supposedly protected government-owned forests, and Human Rights Watch has documented previous brutal government evictions of communities.\n\nFofana Souleymane, of human rights charity RAIDH, said the heavy-handed evictions had created a humanitarian crisis for indigenous communities deprived of healthcare, security and education. \u201cIt\u2019s a very precarious situation,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people have lived in these parks for more than 10 years. Throwing them out is a huge problem \u2013 it destroys their means of living.\u201d\n\nDemand for chocolate is driving deforestation in the Ivory Coast, which produces more than a third of the world\u2019s cocoa. Around 90% of the country\u2019s forests have been destroyed since independence in 1960, forcing species like forest elephants and chimpanzees to near-extinction.\n\nA Global Forest Watch report this year revealed the Ivory Coast had the second highest increase in deforestation rates in the world. If deforestation continues the Cavally Forest will disappear entirely by 2061 and the Goin Debe forest by 2071, according to a report by Mighty Earth.\n\nStudies estimate that there are more than 2 million children working in west Africa\u2019s cocoa fields, and trafficking and slavery is widespread.\n\nStop biodiversity loss or we could face our own extinction, warns UN Read more\n\nEtelle Higonnet of Mighty Earth, a United States-based environmental group, believes the law could improve accountability. \u201cIt\u2019s a wild west free-for-all at the moment, run by what are essentially mafiosos who are often working closely logging companies,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chocolate companies have no responsibility for anything, they have a supply chain that they are not responsible for. There\u2019s all this plausible deniability for these minuscule prices; it is a form of modern slavery.\u201d\n\nOlam Cocoa and Siat did not respond to a request for comment, but Richard Scobey, president of the World Cocoa Foundation, said the drivers of deforestation were \u201ccomplex\u201d and that the industry was working to develop \u201cfull traceability\u201d of farms to tackle illegal cocoa farming.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe government\u2019s new forest law does not promote the lease of large tracts of land to companies for large-scale commercial plantation development. Its strategy is to promote agroforestry concessions based on smallholder farming and community-based natural resource management.\u201d\n\nLast year Alain-Richard Donwahi, the Ivory Coast\u2019s minister for water and forests, committed to restoring a fifth of the forest cover the country had lost by 2030.\n\nThe minister did not respond to repeated requests from the Guardian to comment for this article.", "description": "Critics condemn move placing thousands of square miles of rainforest under control of international companies", "authors": ["Peter Yeung"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/828d238a179590302683d10b09cfc56912d8e78a/0_32_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c7b69b325daeaa4c89b0fd7ee4d44abb", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
