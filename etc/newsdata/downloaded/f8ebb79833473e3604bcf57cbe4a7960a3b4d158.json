His group will be the third-largest bloc in the next Knesset. (Ariel Schalit/AP)\n\nHenriette Chacar is an editor at +972 Magazine\n\nJAFFA, Israel \u2014 As polling in Israel came to a close Tuesday night, my family turned on the news to watch the results trickle in. Flashes of blue and white fired from the screen onto my brother\u2019s face, revealing a sense of relief and confusion. Despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rampant racist rhetoric in recent weeks, around 60 percent of eligible Palestinian voters participated in the elections, up by 10 percentage points over turnout in the April elections, which left no party able to form a government. The Joint List, the slate uniting non-Zionist Palestinian and Jewish candidates, will be the third-largest party in the Knesset, with 13 seats.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, no?\u201d my brother asked.\n\nWell, it\u2019s complicated.\n\nIn the obscure political map still taking shape after a second election in less than six months, in which the right still reigns but is now fragmented, Palestinian voters proved they are a force to be reckoned with, which is impressive. Theoretically, this could grant the Joint List, headed by Ayman Odeh, the ability to determine who ends up serving as prime minister; it would be the first time Palestinians could realistically consider joining the governing coalition or leading the opposition.\n\nBut in the shadow of an ostensible Palestinian electoral victory looms a truth as old as Israel itself: In a system built on Jewish supremacy, on one group\u2019s unequivocal abuse of power over others, those who demand full equality have negligible political weight. The Joint List amassing more members in the next Knesset is a fleeting, even misleading success \u2014 no matter the turnout rate, no matter who ends up forming a new government. After all, last year, the Knesset passed the Jewish Nation-State Law, a racist bill that enshrines Jewish superiority by claiming only Jewish people have a right to self-determination in Israel and the Palestinian territories, promoting Jewish settlement also on occupied territory, and abolishing Arabic as an official language of the state \u2014 even with the most ever Palestinian representatives sitting in Parliament.\n\nUpon Israel\u2019s establishment, and then after its 1967 occupation of the West Bank and Jerusalem, the state invented different legal classifications for Palestinians. Palestinian citizens, the 20 percent of Israel\u2019s population whom the government labels as \u201cIsraeli Arabs,\u201d are considered separate from Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and refugees in the diaspora. We hold Israeli identification cards and passports, while West Bank and Gaza, and East Jerusalem residents, are subject to Israel\u2019s intricate yet arbitrary permit regime. As far as Israel is concerned, Palestinian refugees, many of whom forcefully fled their homes in the 1948 war, have no connection to this land.\n\n[What my Palestinian family lost at Israel\u2019s founding \u2014 and what it means for me]\n\nThrough this false stratification, Israel can continue referring to us as a minority, even though Palestinians are a demographic majority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. By giving only a certain class of Palestinians the right vote, Israel maintains a veneer of democracy, even though more than 75 percent of Palestinians who live under varying degrees of its rule are disenfranchised.\n\nDespite this hierarchy of status, the state views all Palestinians as a threat, both collectively and as individuals. It treats Palestinians with similar policies of discrimination and dispossession, including home demolitions, confiscation of Palestinian land and police brutality \u2014 regardless of whether we are citizens.\n\nThis is how Netanyahu\u2019s baseless warnings of Palestinian citizens \u201cstealing\u201d the elections last week can largely go unquestioned, or how a voter intimidation campaign exclusively targeting Palestinian citizens in April, when a settler-aligned public relations firm and Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party sent 1,300 activists wearing hidden cameras to \u201cmonitor\u201d elections in exclusively Palestinian or Palestinian-majority areas, can be spun as an attempt to prevent voter fraud.\n\nHours before election day, Facebook temporarily suspended Netanyahu\u2019s chatbot on his official page for violating the company\u2019s hate speech policy, after sending a message to his followers claiming \u201cArabs want to annihilate us all.\u201d He later chalked it off as a staffer\u2019s mistake, but the message had already been sent, and the existential fear of Palestinians resonates with many Jewish Israelis.\n\nThe alternative to Likud\u2019s Netanyahu, the Blue and White party led by former Army chief of staff Benny Gantz, isn\u2019t really any different on most questions that matter to Palestinians\u2019 daily lives. Gantz\u2019s party has no intention of ending the occupation, of stopping settlement expansion, of granting full rights to Palestinian citizens, of considering the repatriation of Palestinian refugees. Many of Blue and White\u2019s members have either worked with Netanyahu or support his party\u2019s policies. The differences between them are nominal: Whereas Netanyahu openly declares his intention to annex the Jordan Valley, perhaps emboldened by more than a decade of holding the premiership, Gantz minces words and says he is \u201cin favor of leaving the valley in Israeli hands in any possible scenario.\u201d\n\nFor Gantz, boasting about bombing Gaza \u201cback to the stone age\u201d is more politically expedient than even paying lip service to equality, revealing the extent to which Jewish supremacy has been normalized. Gantz has repeatedly said he does not see the Joint List as a viable political partner, as have other Jewish-majority parties. For them, even Odeh\u2019s watered-down campaign, made to appeal to Jewish voters, calling for a shared Jewish-Arab partnership is viewed as radical. To consider Odeh\u2019s conditions for joining a coalition, which involve repealing the Jewish Nation-State law and ending the occupation, is out of the question.\n\n[Israel lets Jews protest the occupation. It doesn\u2019t let Palestinians.]\n\nEven if the Joint List did lead the opposition, which is highly unlikely given the politics, as the only party interested in ending the occupation, all it offers is the two-state solution \u2014 an outdated, irrelevant vision which ignores years of Israel\u2019s de facto annexation and apartheid policies.\n\nIn modern nation-states, citizenship is a privilege, and the right to vote in democratic elections even more so. Millions of stateless Palestinians can attest to that. But without disputing the power imbalance and challenging Jewish supremacy, participating in the legislature could lead to very limited and narrow improvements at best. Only once the international community holds Israel to the standards of international law will a step in the direction of justice and full equality be possible.\n\nParliament has rarely, if ever, been the place where the powerful voluntarily cede their superiority. It\u2019s time Palestinian citizens see beyond the confines of our second-class citizenship and break from the shackles of Israel\u2019s engineered separation, to imagine a future in which we are free in practice, not just in appearance.", "description": "Whether Netanyahu or Gantz forms the next government, the right-wing policies will remain the same.", "authors": ["Henriette Chacar", "Henriette Chacar Is An Editor At", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7yxyRLVmXY0Eiv2Syj2iV_htCD4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NLJJZCG2CQI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
