J.B. Pritzker last month issued a pardon for Mr. Perez\u2019s crime, and American border officials allowed him into the U.S. on Monday.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection \u201chas granted him parole for 14 days so that he may attend his citizenship appointment scheduled for Wednesday,\u201d Sara Walker, an immigrant rights activist, announced in a statement.\n\nMr. Perez is the latest in a string of migrants who have had their immigration cases bolstered by pardons from Democratic governors, who say they are trying to blunt the sharpest edges of President Trump\u2019s illegal immigration crackdown.\n\nMr. Perez was born in Mexico and came to the U.S. as a youth. He had legal status as a green card holder and could have applied for citizenship in the 1990s but didn\u2019t do so.\n\nHe joined the U.S. Army and was deployed to Afghanistan where he developed the PTSD he says contributed to his later criminal behavior back home. He was charged with manufacturing cocaine, pleaded guilty to one drug trafficking charge and served more than seven years in prison.\n\nThe drug crime negated his legal status in the U.S. Upon his release in 2016, he was turned over to ICE, which began deportation proceedings against him. He battled for a year and a half, enlisting support of high-powered congressional Democrats, but ICE rejected his plea.\n\nNow he\u2019s rushing to try to win citizenship, with the drug conviction erased from his record. His application will be heard by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nMr. Perez\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t respond to a message seeking comment about his client\u2019s chances.\n\nMatthew O\u2019Brien, research director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform and a former USCIS official, said those applying for naturalization are required to show good moral character and a criminal record is a severe black mark.\n\nHe said the agency has generally given a pass to applicants who received a pardon, even though the agency\u2019s own regulations say applicants are supposed to prove they rehabilitated themselves well before they apply for citizenship.\n\nHe said it will be interesting to see whether the agency, now under a new hard-charging acting director in Ken Cuccinelli, will take a more skeptical look.\n\n\u201cI suspect that the Trump administration, under acting Director Cuccinelli\u2019s leadership, will require that the showings mandated by the regulation are actually made, and will not hesitate to deny naturalization if those showings cannot be made,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. O\u2019Brien said Mr. Perez\u2019s situation raises questions about how much military service should be used as a shield in immigration.\n\nHe said immigration officials should take into account PTSD developed during the military that could play a role in later criminal activities and drug use. But it\u2019s not an automatic excuse.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re out of the military and have consistently engaged in a pattern of criminal behavior and haven\u2019t bothered to become a citizen, I don\u2019t believe that should be a catch-all to excuse your criminal behavior,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said.\n\nMr. Perez says his PTSD did contribute to his criminal behavior.\n\nHe said he received treatment in prison and was planning to use Veterans Affairs clinics after he was released \u2014 but when he was deported to Mexico that option disappeared.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
