The employee later recused himself, left the department and returned to AWS.\n\nAmazon is reportedly considering options for appealing against the decision, according to a Reuters source.\n\nThe Jedi contract is important because the Pentagon\u2019s information technology has been described as woefully inadequate by officials, despite the US boasting the world\u2019s most powerful fighting force.\n\nOfficials have complained of outdated computers systems and difficulties accessing files or sharing information as quickly as they might be able to in the private sector.\n\nDuring the contracting process, some companies raised concerns that a single award would give an unfair advantage to the winner for follow-on work, prompting the Pentagon to say it plans to award future cloud deals to multiple contractors.\n\nThis week, Mark Esper, the US defence secretary, removed himself from reviewing the deal due to his son\u2019s employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM Corp. However, IBM had already been eliminated from the competition before the final stages.\n\nIBM and Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters, while Microsoft said it is working on a comment.\n\nAccording to an upcoming book by a former Trump administration official, Mr Trump called James Mattis, the former defence secretary, and told him to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d by preventing it from bidding on the Jedi contract.\n\nGuy Snodgrass, a former speech writer to Mr Mattis, said the then-defence secretary told other Pentagon officials: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that ...This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\u201d\n\nMr Snodgrass declined to comment ahead of the release of his book.\n\nIn a statement announcing the decision to award the contract to Microsoft, the Pentagon has insisted that the competition was conducted fairly and legally.\n\n\u201cAll [offers] were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation's stated evaluation criteria,\u201d the organisation said.\n\n\u201cPrior to the award, the department conferred with the DOD Inspector General, which informed the decision to proceed.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft shares were up 3 per cent to $144.98 in after-hours trading after the news. Meanwhile, Amazon shares were down 0.92 per cent to $1,745.12.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters\n\nRead more\n\nAmazon could face heightened scrutiny from Trump administration\n\nPentagon official set to testify in Trump impeachment probe\n\nNew account details Trump outburst during his first Pentagon briefing\n\nUS faces \u2018risk of exploding planes' due to border wall funding\n\nPentagon\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \u2018higher than Sweden or Portugal\u2019\n\nThird of Pentagon money Trump plans to use for wall already spent", "description": "Microsoft has beaten Amazon to a $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) cloud computer contract after an intensely scrutinised bidding process which drew criticism from Donald Trump.The Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure Cloud (Jedi) contract is aimed at modernising the Pentagon and making it more technologically agile", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V4hfpxTTsFDqwnNnnm3uhw--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/27bd452a06bd3e5eea7f1809b9655a62", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
