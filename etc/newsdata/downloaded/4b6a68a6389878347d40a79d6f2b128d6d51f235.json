Eja has two sons Azibo and Ayubu, eight, and they together with their mother's support made Bili's life hell from the start.\"\n\nBonobo mothers protect their sons even as adults.\n\nBut because Bili was rejected by his and moved to Germany to be raised by hand, it made life very difficult for him.\n\n(Image: CEN/Der Gr\u00c3\u00bcne Zoo Wuppertal)\n\n(Image: CEN/Der Gr\u00c3\u00bcne Zoo Wuppertal)\n\nBili has now been separated from Eja, and her two sons now spend some time with the Brit chimp with no issues.\n\nAnd Bili has also formed a close bond with two females Mahdeblu, 18, and Kichele, 30, who are BOTH his girlfriends.\n\nDr Dressen said: \"Bili mates with both of them. Sex seems to be really important to Bili. They seem to get on well and Bili is accepted.\"\n\nBili is also close to Mahdeblu's daughter, five-year-old Akeena, and is often seen hugging her\n\nBili even has some male camaraderie as the troop's grandfather Mato, 55, has also accepted him and plays with him in the enclosure.\n\n(Image: CEN/Zoo Wuppertal)\n\nA zoo spokesman said: \"Bili looks much more relaxed overall. We could no longer observe any aggression against him lately.\"\n\nWuppertal Zoo director Dr Arne Lawrenz said people have a romanticised image of nature.\n\nDr Lawrenz added: \"This is why there must be zoos, where we can show what nature really looks like.\n\n\"That is our mission and that's why we, as zoos, might be at a crossroads here.\n\n\"For example, in the US there is a tendency to not exhibit bonobos because they are politically incorrect in terms of their sexual behaviour and aggression.\n\n\"I believe that zoos need to show people that nature is not all about peace, love and harmony, and that it's also about rivalry and that the animals are subject to different laws to humans.\"\n\nBili's mum, Maringa, failed to care for him when he was born in Twycross Zoo, Leicestershire, in October, 2008.\n\nBecause she didn't protect him when he was growing up, Bili was moved to Frankfurt, where he was adopted by two female chimps\n\nBili was adopted by loving female chimps in Frankfurt who have experience dealing with unwanted youngsters.\n\nHe was then sent to Wuppertal Zoo on the recommendation of the Specialist Group of the European Zoological Community and the European Conservation Breeding Programme.", "description": "Heartbreaking footage emerged earlier this year of Bili the bonobo chimp being repeatedly being beaten up by other primates at Wuppertal Zoo", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Image", "Cen", "Cen Der Gr\u00e3\u00bcNe Zoo Wuppertal", "Cen Zoo Wuppertal"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586875.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-CEN-AttackedChimp-01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
