The Opposition is livid. It has taken offence at the fact that the Centre is facilitating a \u2018guided\u2019 tour for a group of foreign parliamentarians but didn\u2019t allow Indian parliamentarians an opportunity to visit the state. Selectiveness aside, the Opposition has also drawn attention to the composition of the EU MPs team. The Opposition has pointed out that the 27 MPs are mostly drawn from extreme right-wing parties that subscribe to a decidedly fascist-Islamophobic world view. It is reported that one of the MPs was \u2018\u2019sacked from the EU vice-president\u2019s post for making a slur with Nazi connotations\u2019\u2019. Another MP tweeted \u201cwhy there are so many Jews among abortionists despite the Holocaust?\u2019\u2019. A cursory reading of the resumes of the \u2018controversial\u2019 27 point towards an aversion towards immigration and multi-culturalism.\n\nMoral undesirability apart, it is also the Opposition\u2019s view that the invitation adds a 3rd party dimension to the Kashmir dispute. India has always abjured any talk of 3rd party meddling in the state and as such any move to seek a certificate of approval from foreign powers undermines this well- established convention. Remember, successive ruling regimes at the Centre have even gone to the extent of declaring that the UN resolutions on Kashmir have outlived their utility and are irrelevant after the Simla Agreement of 1972.\n\nBut despite the reservations and contradictions the NDA has defended the move to invite the EU MPs for an \u2018unofficial tour and briefing\u2019 to counter Pakistan\u2019s fake propaganda within the European community.\n\nThe NDA\u2019s intractability doesn\u2019t surprise. First, the NDA has already signaled that it won\u2019t be guided by convention in outlining its policy on Kashmir. The decisions to share power with Mehbooba Mufti\u2019s PDP, appointing an interlocutor to engage all stakeholders, crossing the LoC to avenge Pakistan sponsored terror attacks and most recently diluting Article 370 are at one with this penchant for upending the status quo.\n\nSecond, the Opposition\u2019s reasons for protesting the tour \u2013 that the MPs are from a far right bigoted persuasion and opens Kashmir to 3rd party mediation \u2013 are entirely self-serving. As Hillary Clinton once said, \u2018\u2019part of diplomacy is to open different definitions of self-interest.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt is in India\u2019s self-interest today to fight the fake narrative peddled by Pakistan, sections of the international liberal media and opportunists among the Opposition at home. New Delhi must not hesitate to engage any and every ideological persuasion internationally to ensure that its side of the story is heard over and beyond the propaganda of ideological and political opponents.\n\nIn the 60s, Pakistan saw advantage in cultivating a strategic relationship with Communist China despite sitting deep within the liberal-democratic-capitalist arc of the West. Even though it was a member of the US-led CENTO and SEATO opposition parties and liberal intellectuals in Pakistan did not bat an eye-lid when Islamabad\u2019s strategists thwarted India on Kashmir by doing business with Mao\u2019s China. The move may have reeked of moral subterfuge but it was a master stroke that strategic analysts will readily agree is still bearing diplomatic fruit for Pakistan.\n\nAgain, if ideological persuasions were always to be the guiding principles of foreign policy will Modi critics in India give up their obsession about pushing New Delhi to make concessions to \u2018Islamo-fascist\u2019 Pakistan and its \u2018Communist cohort\u2019 China?\n\nOn the question of 3rd party mediation, if elements within our own anti-Modi camp were to have their way New Delhi ought to be apologetic about roping in the UN in its fight against Pak sponsored terror. Hasn\u2019t India lobbied the UN to proscribe Pakistan sponsored terror organizations that ply their deadly trade across the LoC in the perennial quest of liberating Kashmir? How isn\u2019t that taking the Kashmir issue to an international forum?\n\nPakistan, it must be remembered, is an equal signatory to the Shimla agreement of 1972 but that has never stopped it from internationalizing the Kashmir dispute, even today, when it has a lot more to hide than India.\n\nPragmatism dictates, if anything, that the government\u2019s move to invite the 27 European MPs to Kashmir should mark the end of the facile diffidence in India\u2019s strategic community over internationalizing the Kashmir Issue. India has nothing to hide. It only has territory to gain in Kashmir and it should look to build strong alliances in the international community to help undo the greatest wrong in Independent India\u2019s history: the forced vivisection of Kashmir.", "description": "The NDA\u2019s decision to roll out the red-carpet for a group of 27 European Members of Parliament has quickly turned controversial.
