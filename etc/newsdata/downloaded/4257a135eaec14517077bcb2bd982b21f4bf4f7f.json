And you know, they have a majestic presence, they are the iconic symbol of this part of the world. You know you're someplace different when you're in a saguaro forest.\"\n\nThe species in the park are protected by federal law, so crews are moving saguaros technically within a 60-foot strip of land called the Roosevelt Reservation that the government has access to for border protection, according to Earther.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers released a video last month saying that the saguaros and other types of cacti were being relocated to another area considered part of their natural habitat.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSUIT OVER SOW: Workers are suing over a new U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rule that allows pork processing plants to speed up production lines, something their union says could endanger employees.\n\nThe USDA rule, announced in September, would remove a cap on the speed that inspection lines can run and also reduce the number of food inspectors who look over pork products.\n\nUnited Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), which filed the suit on behalf of 30,000 pork plant workers nationwide, noted that meatpacking workers are injured more than twice the average for all private industries.\n\n\"Thousands of our members work hard every day in America's pork plants to help families across the country put food on the table. Increasing pork plant line speeds not only is a reckless giveaway to giant corporations, it will put thousands of workers in harm's way,\" said Marc Perrone, president of UFCW. \"This new rule also would dramatically weaken critical protections that Americans depend on to be able to select safe, healthy food to feed their families every day.\"\n\nThe USDA rule would give plants more power in overseeing the inspection of meat. The agency said reducing the number of USDA inspectors would save them $8.7 million.\n\n\"This regulatory change allows us to ensure food safety while eliminating outdated rules and allowing for companies to innovate,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueGOP Senate candidate Tommy Tuberville says Trump has 'put a noose' around farmers' necks with trade war Trump agriculture chief: No guarantee small farms can survive On The Money: Trump blames Fed as manufacturing falters | US to join Trump lawsuit over NY subpoena for tax returns | Ex-Rep.
