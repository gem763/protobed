I chose to run a marathon while I was still in college, which resulted in some additional costs, and overall the experience ended up being more expensive than I thought it\u2019d be.\n\nRead more: Everyone says running is the cheapest sport \u2013 but it still costs me over $500 a year\n\nWhile I picked a marathon with a relatively low entry fee, additional costs ranged from financial fees like expensive running sneakers to non-monetary ones like losing free time on weekends. Additionally, small purchases \u2013 including extra granola bars and boxes of Band-Aids \u2013 spread out over six months of training definitely added up.\n\nKeep reading for a look at some unexpected costs I encountered while training for a marathon.\n\nNew sneakers cost more than I unexpected.\n\nsource Brooks\n\nThis was an item I knew I needed to invest in from the beginning, but I was surprised by how much a decent pair of running shoes actually costs. I wanted to make sure I used the same pair I\u2019d wear for race day during my training and went to a running store soon after signing up to get properly fitted for a new pair.\n\nWhile some people always splurge on sneakers, I typically bought running shoes on sale for around $50 to $60, which was really all I needed to spend for the light running I was doing prior to the marathon. After visiting a legitimate running store, getting my feet measured, and talking with seasoned runners, I quickly realized the unexpected cost of sneakers.\n\nSources recommend replacing your running shoes roughly every six months or every 300 miles \u2013 both of these metrics correspond with training for a marathon, so it\u2019s worth investing in a new pair soon after signing up.\n\nAt specialty running shops, sales associates observe how you run and examine your current pair of sneakers to help you pick which new pair will work best. I run on the outsides of my feet and had worn down the heels of my last pair of sneakers. I ended getting fitted for a pair of Asics, which retail for around $100 \u2013 a good $30 more than I was planning on spending. I could have easily spent even more money, but I drew the line at $100.\n\nAdditional running gear, including quality shirts and running socks, added up.\n\nsource lzf/Shutterstock\n\nWhile this certainly wasn\u2019t a necessary purchase, I decided to spring for some new running clothes for race day. Sources advise not running in \u201csuffocating\u201d cotton T-shirts \u2013 which, prior to running a marathon, was my usual go-to. As a college student, I usually ran outside or frequented the gym in one of many T-shirts I had gotten for free in freshman orientation.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how cold it would be come late October, so I bought performance sports shirts in both long-sleeved and short-sleeved versions. I saved money by buying cheaper items from Target, but costs for a new running outfit can quickly add up. I ended up wearing an older pair of leggings since they had pockets on the sides \u2013 great for holding food \u2013 but a new pair would have added at least $40 to my running total.\n\nI also opted to wear thick Nike running socks. Thankfully I received these as a gift, because $18 is way more than I\u2019d typically spend on a pair. However, I can confirm these were worth the money, as running for 26.2 miles with blisters can ruin a race.\n\nFood and drinks quickly added up, too.\n\nsource Shutterstock\n\nThe schedule I followed required a few short runs during the week and then one long, slow run on the weekend, typical of most basic marathon training plans.\n\nThese long runs also required a lot of refueling. Unlike a quick two-mile jog, running over 10 miles regularly prompted me to stock up on granola bars and Gatorade. These small purchases, spread out over six months of training, definitely added up. That semester, I noticed I was spending more than usual with all the extra trips to the campus market to grab handfuls of overpriced Clif Bars.\n\nIn addition to the race entry fee, I had to find a way to get there.\n\nWhile buses or cars are typically cheaper options to travel, due to my class and work schedule I was forced to fly to make it to the race with time to spare. I didn\u2019t want to be stuck on a bus until 10 p.m. the night before the race, so I purchased a round-trip plane ticket from Pittsburgh to Washington, DC \u2013 a more than $200 transaction.\n\nWhile this hefty additional cost was definitely avoidable, if I were to ever run another marathon outside my home city, I\u2019d still have to pay for the cost of transportation, whether by bus, car, or train. Initially, I had only accounted for the entry fee, which at around $120 in 2015 (now it\u2019s $180) was cheaper than most. (The NYC marathon, for example, costs $295 for non-New York Road Runner Club members). Despite this saving, I soon realized that I would need to factor in the cost to get there.\n\nI stayed with family in Arlington, Virginia, but for those without friends or family in the area, additional costs to consider before running also include a hotel and restaurant meals for the day before and the day after the race.\n\nA small investment was an armband to hold my phone while listening to music.\n\nA new armband was a last-minute purchase just a day before the race, but I realized it was something I should have invested in from the beginning. I usually held my phone while running, especially since I oftentimes used it as a GPS or would need to answer a phone call. However, during the race, there was no need to hold it, and I was advised to purchase an armband to attach the phone to my arm while I listened to music.\n\nI ended up using an old pair of headphones that plugged directly into my phone \u2013 mainly because I had a ridiculous fear that wireless headphones would die and I\u2019d be left music-less for the last 13 miles. Looking back, I should have invested in a quality pair of wireless headphones, which would have been an additional charge of at least $100.\n\nFor casual joggers-turned-race-runners, investing in quality phone accessories for listening to music and tracking runs is important, but this unexpected cost could total a couple hundred dollars. Regardless, I still think it\u2019s worth the investment if you\u2019ll be running often.\n\nAnd another small, but still unexpected, cost was first-aid supplies.\n\nsource Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nAnother small, but still unexpected, cost of my marathon was medical supplies. I ended up buying Band-Aids for blisters, along with an Ace bandage and ice packs to wrap my knees after running. I later purchased a compression knee brace which I wore for the last few weeks of training.\n\nLike food, these small purchases quickly added up over the months. While none of these drugstore items broke the bank, I did splurge on higher-quality Band-Aids to make sure my new shoes weren\u2019t rubbing. At over $4 a box, this was certainly more than I\u2019d typically spend on a box of Band-Aids. However, like the running socks, they paid off in the long run, but this still didn\u2019t change the fact that they were an unforeseen cost.\n\nThen were some non-monetary costs. During training, for example, I lost free time on the weekends.\n\nsource Studio Romantic/Shutterstock\n\nThe schedule I followed required a few short runs during the week and then one long, slow run on the weekend, typical of most basic marathon training plans. This long weekend run began as only three or four miles, which took less than 45 minutes. However, as it got closer and closer to the race, I was running up to 15 or 20 miles on weekends, which ate up hours of the day.\n\nEspecially during my sophomore year of college, those hours were time my friends spent together in the library, the dining hall, or the dorm lounge. My part-time job in the athletic department also required me to work sporting events many weekends, and I had to squeeze in runs around this schedule. As a result, I missed out on social activities while I was training. This was something I didn\u2019t realize until after race day had passed \u2013 I suddenly had way more free time than I\u2019d had before.\n\nAnd training for the marathon also impacted my other athletic activities.\n\nI had signed up for a cycling class the semester I ran the race, and I didn\u2019t consider the impact marathon training would have on the regular athletic activities I wasn\u2019t willing to give up. The cycling class proved beneficial, as it kept me active during the week if I ever had to skip a run, but there were definitely many days when I showed up with extremely sore legs. Compared to my roommates who took the class with me, their regular gym routine was way more compatible with the class compared to my irregular running schedule.\n\nI also played club field hockey at the time, and marathon running definitely took a toll. Practice was only once or twice a week, but when these days aligned with my running days, I felt an extra strain than I usually did for quick pick-up games and drills. As it got closer to marathon weekend, I even skipped practices to avoid injury just days before the race.\n\nLastly, running a marathon might put you out of commission for a time. I had to deal with the costs of missing class and work the weekend of the race.\n\nsource PeopleImages/Getty\n\nEven with flying to save time, I still missed the Monday after the Sunday race, which cost me a day\u2019s hourly wages plus class attendance for that day. I was able to make up the work, but I originally hadn\u2019t accounted for missing a full day\u2019s schedule when I signed up months before.\n\nOverall, this is something important to keep in mind, as you typically sign up for a marathon six months before, and sometimes more. It\u2019s almost impossible to know your work schedule for an hourly part-time job, meetings you\u2019ll miss at a salaried full-time position, and for those in college, you sometimes haven\u2019t even signed up for classes yet to know what lectures you\u2019ll have to skip. Most of these calendar events are hopefully adjustable, but you\u2019ll still have to make sacrifices to make it an event you paid for months in advance.", "description": "Business Insider - Running a marathon will cost you way more than just the entry fee.
