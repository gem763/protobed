He would almost be happy if the judge said 'you can't call it that'.\"\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said today: \u201cThe Prime Minister has been clear throughout that we will obey the law. We are leaving on October 31. The manner in which this policy is lawfully achieved is a matter for the government.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson will not have to write the delay letter if he manages to secure a Brexit deal at an EU summit on October 17.\n\nBut hopes of any deal are fading fast after EU sources rejected his new proposal for \"two borders\" in Northern Ireland.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron gave the UK a deadline of this Friday to compromise - as the PM ramped up his no-deal Brexit rhetoric.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIn a phone call last night, the French President signalled EU chiefs would decide this week whether the UK had moved enough to strike a deal.\n\nThe PM was talking to more EU leaders today while his top Brexit advisor David Frost and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will spend the week on a whirlwind tour of European capitals.\n\nA senior No 10 source said: \u201cThe UK has made a big, important offer but it\u2019s time for the Commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not the UK will leave with no deal\u201d.\n\n(Image: Hollie Adams)\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\nThe petitioners launched today's legal case in the belief that Downing Street cannot be trusted to abide by the law.\n\nThe 'Benn Act', passed by Westminster last month, requires the Prime Minister to ask the EU for a Brexit extension to January 31 if Parliament does not agree to any withdrawal deal by October 19.\n\nLegal action - led by businessman and founder of the firm Ecotricity Vince Dale, SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC - was launched at the Outer House of Edinburgh's Court of Session.\n\nIt sought to create an order which would force Mr Johnson to send the letter and prohibits him from frustrating the Act's purpose.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThis included banning him from asking EU member states to deny the letter's request or by sending an additional letter which contradicts it.\n\nAidan O'Neill QC, representing the campaigners behind the legal action, claimed Mr Johnson's previous statements go against what he has said to the court through the documents.\n\nHe referred to promises made by the Prime Minister that he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than send a letter requesting an extension, and that the UK will leave on October 31 \"do or die\".", "description": "Edinburgh's Court of Session ruled against the bid for two court orders - as the PM considers forcing the issue to a Supreme Court showdown", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images", "Hollie Adams", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529550.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Cabinet-meeting-in-Downing-Street-in-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
