Hurricane-force winds extended 70 miles out from the storm center.\n\nForecasters warned the storm would approach the coast of South Carolina Wednesday night, move near or over the coast of South Carolina on Thursday and then near or over North Carolina\u2019s coast on Thursday night and Friday. Surging waters could cause severe flooding in some areas, but the storm isn\u2019t expected to intensify, they said.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said the state has experienced deadly hurricanes in the past, but he warned that complacency could be deadly. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let familiarity get in the way of good judgment,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Cooper said Dorian continued to be a very dangerous storm, with the possibility of dumping heavy rain along the coast for well over 24 hours starting Thursday morning. Forecasters expect storm surge could raise water levels on the North Carolina coast by as much as 4 to 7 feet above normal tide.\n\nSchools in North Carolina were canceled ahead of the storm as far inland as Raleigh, more than two hours\u2019 drive from the coast. In Wilmington, downtown businesses had placed sandbags by their doors and windows in expectation that the Cape Fear River would flood downtown streets, as it did during Hurricane Florence last year.\n\nVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam also has declared an emergency in anticipation of the storm striking his state\u2019s coast. The hurricane center on Wednesday issued tropical-storm and storm-surge warnings for the parts of the state.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp told a news conference in Atlanta the storm\u2019s slow movement was \u201cunheard of\u201d and prolonged its disruption of people\u2019s lives, as governments worked to coordinate emergency responses, issue evacuation orders and manage roadways to and from the coast.\n\nPhotos: Bahamas Reel From Dorian\u2019s Devastation The path of the powerful storm was highly unpredictable Residents look through debris on Wednesday from Hurricane Dorian on Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas. joe skipper/Reuters 1 of 18 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 of 18 Show Caption Residents look through debris on Wednesday from Hurricane Dorian on Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas. joe skipper/Reuters\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s frustrating for our people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been through way too much of this. But we\u2019ve got to hunker down and chop some wood and get through one more.\u201d\n\nFlorida was spared the brunt of the storm, leaving residents breathing a sigh of relief. By Wednesday afternoon, traffic returned to streets, and supermarkets, shops and other businesses began reopening in the central, coastal part of the state.\n\nIn Volusia County, home to Daytona Beach, fire crews inspected structures and found no major damage, and power outages were minimal, said George Recktenwald, the county manager.\n\n\u201cTo say we dodged a bullet for the storm would be an understatement,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we dodged a missile.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, who approved emergency declarations in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, expressed relief Wednesday that the storm didn\u2019t batter Florida as feared. He cautioned that the Carolinas and other states were still threatened.\n\nAppearing before reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office, the president held up a previously published hurricane projection showing a path through Florida. It contained a black line extending the path into Alabama. Mr. Trump had tweeted over the weekend that Alabama could be among the states in the path, which forecasters said wasn\u2019t true.\n\nAt an event later in the day, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI know Alabama was in the original forecast.\u201d Asked about the black line on the map, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina issued mandatory evacuation orders for coastal counties. Mr. Cooper ordered a mandatory evacuation of all of North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands.\n\nDorian\u2019s Path 5-day probable track area Va. 2 p.m. Fri. N.C. 2 a.m. Fri. S.C. 2 p.m. Thurs.

With additional shelters opening in North Carolina, the group said it could temporarily house as many as 60,000 people. In Georgia, state shelters were housing 5,600 people and could handle more, according to officials. Animal shelters were housing dogs, cats and about 300 horses, officials said.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What should authorities be doing to ensure the safety of those in the path of Dorian?

As of late Tuesday, rescuers had successfully airlifted 61 people from affected areas, it said.\n\nThe death toll from Dorian rose to seven, Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said Tuesday evening. \u201cWe can expect more deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us as a people have compassion for the families of those who lost their lives.\u201d\n\nDebris and destruction on the island Great Abaco in the northern Bahamas, photographed Tuesday during a government reconnaissance mission.

But the agency cautioned people to be careful of downed power lines, severe flooding, fallen trees and other debris.\n\nWorkers place boards over a business on King Street ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Charleston, S.C., on Tuesday.
