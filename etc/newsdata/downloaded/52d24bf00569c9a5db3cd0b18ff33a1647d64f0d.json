(AP) \u2014 The California Supreme Court refused Wednesday to block death penalty cases from proceeding during Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s moratorium on executions.\n\nThe justices rejected defense attorneys\u2019 arguments that jurors can\u2019t realistically gauge the seriousness of imposing a death sentence if they think it\u2019s never actually going to be carried out.\n\nNewsom halted executions in March for as long as he remains governor, but the death penalty remains on the books and courts have been proceeding on the assumption that executions may one day resume.\n\nAttorneys for two men separately facing trials in multiple slayings say it\u2019s unfair to ask jurors to consider what for now would be hypothetical sentences.\n\n\u201cIn light of this paradigm shift, a California jury in a capital case cannot be expected to provide a fair and reasoned penalty phase determination free from speculation,\u201d defense attorney Robert Sanger wrote on behalf of his client, Cleamon Demone Johnson.\n\nHe is awaiting trial on five counts of capital murder and one of attempted murder. An appeals court said they were \u201csix casualties of the gang wars between the Bloods and the Crips in the early 1990s.\u201d\n\nCalifornia hasn\u2019t executed anyone since 2006. Still, Los Angeles County prosecutors contend that barring jurors from considering death sentences would be \u201ctantamount to judicial abolition of the death penalty in violation of the wishes of California voters.\u201d\n\nVoters have repeatedly, if narrowly, supported executions and in 2016 approved a ballot measure to speed them up. Lawmakers backed by the governor are considering putting another measure on the November 2020 ballot to repeal the death penalty.\n\nIn July, the justices temporarily halted the case against Jade Douglas Harris. He could face a death sentence if convicted of charges that he killed three people and wounded a 13-year-old boy while stealing a car in 2012.", "description": "California Gov.
