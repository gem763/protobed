(Reuters) - President Donald Trump vowed at a rally in New Mexico on Monday to win the longtime Democratic stronghold state in the November 2020 U.S. election.\n\nThe last time New Mexico supported a Republican in a presidential race was 2004. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton beat Trump there by 8 percentage points in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because we really think we\u2019re going to turn this state and make it a Republican state,\u201d Trump told cheering supporters. \u201cWe will campaign for every vote, and we will win the great state of New Mexico in 2020.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign sees an opening in the state with Latinos, who it believes will swing his way despite tough immigration policies criticized by Democrats, including a crackdown on migrants from Central America and a push to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nTrump told the rally in Rio Rancho that his support was rising among Hispanics.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want criminals coming across the border. They don\u2019t want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security and they want the wall,\u201d he said.\n\nAhead of the trip, Trump tweeted: \u201cBig crowd expected in New Mexico tonight, where we will WIN. Your Border Wall is getting stronger each and every day \u2014 see you in a few hours!\u201d\n\nNew Mexico is rich in oil and natural gas, and Trump touted his support for the fossil fuel industry while assailing Democrats for their policies of promoting renewable energy production.\n\n\u201cEvery major Democrat running for president - they want to abolish all production of oil and natural gas. In other words the Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico\u2019s economy,\u201d the Republican president said.\n\nTrump won the White House in 2016 with electoral votes from traditional Republican-leaning states and some surprise Democratic-leaning ones.\n\nThe Trump campaign says it wants New Mexico\u2019s five electoral votes to augment the 306 electoral votes the president received in his first election, not create a separate path for victory. A candidate must get 270 electoral votes nationally to win.\n\nDemocrats, who did well in New Mexico during the 2018 mid-term elections, are skeptical.\n\n\u201cLast cycle, Democrats crushed Republicans in New Mexico because voters are fed up with President Trump\u2019s toxic healthcare agenda and broken promises,\u201d said David Bergstein, a communications director for the Democratic National Committee focused on battleground states.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\n\u201cWe take nothing for granted, but this GOP strategy looks like they\u2019re concerned about a realistic pathway to 270 electoral votes,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump won electoral-vote-rich swing states such as Ohio and Florida in 2016, while also picking up Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania from Democrats.\n\nThe campaign says it is eyeing more pickups in 2020, including Colorado, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Nevada.", "description": "President Donald Trump vowed at a rally in New Mexico on Monday to win the longtime Democratic stronghold state in the November 2020 U.S. election.", "authors": ["Jeff Mason", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430680265&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G05O", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
