That dispute may finally reach its resolution Saturday, when the imposing monolith known as Uluru will be closed permanently to climbers.\n\nThe approaching closure has been celebrated by the indigenous Anangu people, who consider the site sacred \u2014 and who have long looked on in anguish as tens of thousands of visitors each year try their hand at scaling it.\n\n\"It is an extremely important place, not a playground or theme park like Disneyland,\" Sammy Wilson, then chairman of the board that manages Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, said before the board voted unanimously in 2017 to formally close Uluru to climbers. \"We want you to come, hear us and learn. We've been thinking about this for a very long time.\"\n\nAt the time, the board \u2014 which comprises both national parks officials and traditional indigenous owners such as Wilson \u2014 elected to hold off on implementing the ban until Oct. 26, 2019, an auspicious date in the history of the park. It was precisely 34 years earlier, on Oct. 26, 1985, that Australian authorities handed the title deeds to the land back to the traditional owners.\n\nThis year, with the ban looming, park authorities say they've seen a substantial spike in visitors, a number of whom have sought out the dangerous climb while they can still undertake it \u2014 walking past the signs at its base warning, in several different languages, against doing so. In recent months, images of immensely crowded paths have circulated on social media.\n\n\"The feeling you get from standing at the top is just indescribable,\" one recent climber, who asked not to be identified, explained to the BBC. \"I felt a sense of reverence for the rock afterwards.\"\n\nLocal Aboriginal leaders wish that instead, they would feel and express that reverence for the UNESCO World Heritage site without feeling the need to climb it.\n\n\"If I travel to another country and there is a sacred site, an area of restricted access, I don't enter or climb it, I respect it. It is the same here for Anangu,\" Wilson said. \"We welcome tourists here. We are not stopping tourism, just this activity.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images\n\nIt's not just the sanctity of the site that has persuaded officials to block climbing; it's the deceptive danger of the activity, as well.\n\nIn a fact sheet pointedly titled \"Please Don't Climb,\" Parks Australia said that since record keeping began in the 1950s, at least 35 people have died trying to scale the monolith, which is roughly 95 stories high, steep, slippery and subject to heavy gusts. Every year rescue teams find their hands full with climbers stricken with injuries, heat exhaustion or dehydration.\n\nJust last week, in fact, a 12-year-old girl nearly died after falling more than 65 feet during a climb with her family. She survived with only minor injuries, but only after being airlifted out to a medical clinic the nearest town, Alice Springs.\n\nAfter the closure on Saturday, parks authorities plan to remove a chain that had been installed to help climbers, and anyone found climbing the monolith will be hit with a hefty fine.", "description": "For decades, Uluru's indigenous keepers have watched as visitors tried to scale the massive rock formation that they consider holy.
