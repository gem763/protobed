As with the previous three debates, patient and dedicated viewers had a chance to learn a lot about the candidates \u2014 and to see, once again, the striking diversity of a field that includes multiple women and people of color and a gay man.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it could have been so much better. Here\u2019s my Wednesday-morning quarterbacking of what would have helped both in the debate planning and execution.\n\n1. Including questions about climate change and voting rights. Granted, the time was limited (though hardly short), but these are two of the most crucial issues of our time. And they are sorely underexplored on the debate stage in this political season. Did the rehashing of Medicare-for-all and gun control really need \u2014 again \u2014 to take up so much time at the expense of so much that needs to be fully aired? Binyamin Appelbaum, a Times editorial writer, expressed the exasperation of many: \u201cNo questions about climate change. Zero. Zip. Nada.\u201d The absence was appalling.\n\n2. Framing the (apparently unavoidable) question about universal health care and how to fund it in a non-gotcha way. Journalists are kindly doing President Trump\u2019s work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), the new front-runner, to declare she\u2019d raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-all. Of course, it\u2019s legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad, and misses the larger lens of overall costs. (Warren, notably, refused to take the bait.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n3. Having fewer candidates onstage. It was a relief to have the field tightened from the last round \u2014 as my 20-something daughter drolly acknowledged when she asked me, mid-debate, if I was missing John Hickenlooper. (No, I did not pine for the former Colorado governor, nor former Maryland congressman John Delaney, and couldn\u2019t shed a tear for Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, either.)\n\nStill: 12? At one debate? That never had a chance of being workable, and it wasn\u2019t. One third fewer (just like the calories in light food) would have brought it down to a far more manageable eight, and this viewer could have done without \u2014 for example \u2014 hearing Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard repeat \u201cregime change war\u201d a dozen times during the foreign-policy discussion.\n\nHaving businessman Andrew Yang onstage, however, was delightful if only because of his MATH (Make America Think Harder) lapel pin. Billionaire Tom Steyer? Please.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n4. Making it a tight two hours instead of a mind-numbing three. \u201cThis debate is so long that it contained an entire vaccine news cycle,\u201d quipped BuzzFeed News Editor in Chief Ben Smith sometime in the final hour, tweeting a news story about the publicity around \u2014 and cancellation of \u2014 a Harlem event hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s civil rights organization that would have given credence to anti-vaccine viewpoints.\n\n5. Eliminating the cringe-inducing last question. It was good, this time, not to have dull opening statements and closing statements. But the substitution, in the final minutes, of \u201ctell us about a friendship that you\u2019ve had that would surprise us\u201d was flat-out embarrassing.\n\nA couple of candidates expounded on the late Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), well-known for reaching across the aisle \u2014 thus making the revelations something less than surprising. Others talked about someone they met on the campaign trail, which hardly seemed to amount to a friendship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the question was inspired by the recently hyped, thoroughly self-serving celebrity pseudo-friendship between comedian Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W. Bush.\n\nPerhaps recognizing the hollowness at the heart of the question, many used their last-gasp moments more cannily: to remind viewers how to find their campaign websites.\n\nOn balance, the debate was reasonably substantive and useful. I\u2019d even call it a public service, if a flawed one.\n\nLuckily \u2014 if that\u2019s the right word \u2014 there are eight more chances to get it right.\n\nMORE ON THE DEBATE\n\nFor more by Margaret Sullivan visit wapo.st/sullivan\n\nAD", "description": "Overpopulated and mindbendingly long, the TV spectacle had plenty of merits and some serious flaws.", "authors": ["Margaret Sullivan", "Media Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e5k_w0UT3a0X5UGJ8IAykQBPfn8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T5DNXQXPZUI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
