Comey fueled the adulation with his memoir, \u201cA Higher loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership.\u201d But today\u2019s report by the Justice Department Inspector General should obliterate whatever halo Comey still possesses.\n\nComey wrote seven memos summarizing his interactions with Donald Trump. After he was fired, Comey sent one of those memos to a personal friend and lawyer and directed him to leak the contents to a specific New York Times reporter. The leak achieved the result Comey sought \u2014 the appointment of a special counsel to investigate President Trump.\n\nJames Comey's decision that he was above FBI policy\n\nToday's report documents how Comey brazenly violated federal and FBI policies regarding with his disclosures. Top FBI officials told the IG that they were \"shocked,\" \"stunned,\" and \"surprised\u2019 that Comey would leak the contents of one of the memos to a reporter. The IG concluded: \u201cThe unauthorized disclosure of this information \u2014 information that Comey knew only by virtue of his position as FBI Director \u2014 violated the terms of his FBI Employment Agreement and the FBI's Prepublication Review Policy.\u201d\n\nWhere's our apology:James Comey is back to remind us how Donald Trump got elected\n\nComey claimed that most of the memos he wrote while FBI chief regarding his dealings with Trump were \u201cpersonal documents\u201d like his will or his passport. That defense cannot even pass the laugh test. The IG concluded that the memos were \u201cofficial FBI records\u201d and that Comey violated FBI rules by \u201cfailing to either surrender his copies of Memos 2, 4, 6, and 7 to the FBI or seek authorization to retain them; by releasing official FBI information and records to third parties without authorization; and by failing to immediately alert the FBI about his disclosures to his personal attorneys once he became aware in June 2017 that Memo 2 contained\u201d information \u201cthat the FBI had determined were classified at the \u2018CONFIDENTIAL\u2019 level.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why he violated FBI policy on leaking the memo to the media, Comey declared that the issue was of \u201cincredible importance to the Nation, as a whole\u201d and that he leaked because it was \u201csomething I [had] to do if I love this country\u2026and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI.\u201d Comey apparently believed that his affection exempted him from the rules that all other current and former FBI officials must follow.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey testifying before Congress in 2016. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nThe IG found it \u201cparticularly concerning\u201d that Comey failed to disclose to the FBI that he retained copies of his official memos in his personal safe at home even after FBI officials visited his house to remove all FBI property. \"Comey took for himself the 'carte blanche authority' expressly denied by the courts\" to FBI officials, the report complained.\n\nThe IG concluded that by using sensitive information \u201cto create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees \u2014 and the many thousands more former FBI employees \u2014 who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information.\u201d The IG report warned that \"the civil liberties of every individual who may fall within the scope of the FBI's investigative authorities depend on FBI's ability to protect sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure.\"\n\nThis is true but it ignores the FBI\u2019s long record of violating Americans\u2019 liberties and covert political interventions. As Yale University historian Beverly Gage noted, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover \u201cinsisted that investigative files be kept secret, waging repeated battles to keep them away from the courts and Congress. But he also became a master of the leak, parceling out choice tidbits to reporters at strategic moments.\u201d Hoover\u2019s FBI covertly intervened in the presidential elections of 1948 (seeking to sabotage Henry Wallace\u2019s campaign), 1952 (smearing Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson as gay), and 1964 (spying on the campaign of Republican nominee Barry Goldwater).\n\nThis misconduct rings similar to what was allowed from Hillary Clinton\n\nComey\u2019s abuse of power to undermine President Trump should be viewed in light of last year\u2019s Inspector General report on the FBI\u2019s kowtowing in their investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. The FBI chose to exonerate Secretary Clinton despite her violations of federal laws on the handling of confidential information and despite the destruction of evidence and false statements by her aides and associates. The FBI intended to absolve her \u201cabsent a confession from Clinton\u201d when they finally interviewed her in July 2016. Comey assured the IG that \u201cby her demeanor, she was credible and open and all that kind of stuff\u201d in that interview \u2014 even though FBI agents there believed Clinton had lied to them about not realizing she received confidential information.\n\nLack of accountability:Trump wants to strike fear in anyone who might investigate or expose him, and it's working\n\nThe Justice Department, choosing not to prosecute the former FBI chief for the violations disclosed Thursday, awarded Comey the same \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card that the FBI granted to Hillary Clinton. Other FBI officials who have been investigated were not so lucky. Fourteen FBI officials have been referred to the bureau\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility for leaks or unauthorized disclosures in recent years, and several of them were fired, suspended, or censured, according to internal FBI documents disclosed by Judicial Watch. Though Comey\u2019s leaks had far greater impact and propelled a lengthy investigation that eventually concluded that there was no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, his lofty former position may have insulated him from legal perils.\n\nThursday's report is a reminder that Trump\u2019s frequent falsehoods do not automatically make his opponents trustworthy. Americans have yet to learn the full extent of illegitimate and/or tawdry political and bureaucratic meddling during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. There is at least one more Inspector General report pending on the FBI's conduct regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretaps of the Trump campaign \u2014 a report that may prove far more troublesome to plenty of former FBI officials.\n\nJames Bovard, author of \"Attention Deficit Democracy,\" is a member of USA TODAY\u2019s Board of Contributors.
