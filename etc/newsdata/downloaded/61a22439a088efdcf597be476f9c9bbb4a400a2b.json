The way they beat them was comprehensive so they are the favourites, but we have a foot in the door and anything can happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very physical. The only way we know is fighting fire with fire. We base our game on physicality and they\u2019re a very physical side at the moment. It\u2019s going to be the team that dominates the gainline that wins the game.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

unstoppable power game, welcomed the challenge from the South Africa camp.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa are a similar threat to New Zealand and as you saw on Sunday they are very big people, but then again we have a few big blokes on our team,\u201d Vunipola said on Tuesday. \u201cThey have already come out and said they want to fight fire with fire and I guess we return it by saying bring it on.\n\n\u201cIt is a final, and it\u2019s one of those things you have to front up to and it\u2019s one of their biggest assets, bit it\u2019s something we have been working on. Like Eddie [Jones] has mentioned they have many different threats and one is their forward pack.\n\n\u201cWhen coaches throw words like brutality at you, you kind of have to back it up. We have been challenged again to bring the same intensity this weekend.\n\n\u201cThey have some big players on their team. None more so probably than their second rowers and Duane [Vermeulen], those guys are great players and it is a challenge for us up front to give people like Elliot [Daly] and everyone else around him that time and space with the ball to do what they do.\u201d\n\nEngland seemed to dominate every collision against the All Blacks in what proved to be one of the great all-time World Cup performances, led by the supremely combative Underhill and Curry.\n\nWith ball-carriers such as Vunipola, his brother Mako and Manu Tuilagi complementing the two flankers\u2019 phenomenal defensive effort, the players appear to be spurring each other on collision after collision, which could help them to make the difference this weekend against a South African side that also relishes that physical confrontation.\n\n\u201cIt's something that you probably can't measure, but I think the best way to explain it is that it's quite contagious,\u201d Vunipola added. \u201cIt shows everyone it can be done, so everyone else tries to follow in the slipstreams of Underhill, Curry, Maro [Itoje].\n\n\u201cIt's very easy when you see it. A lot of people talk about it and it's easy to sit here and say we want to be brutal, but you have to back those words up and those guys are probably the best at leading that area.\u201d", "description": "Billy Vunipola told the Springboks to \u201cbring it on\u201d after they stated their desire to \u201cfight fire with fire\u201d in an effort to stop England\u00a0from winning Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup final.
