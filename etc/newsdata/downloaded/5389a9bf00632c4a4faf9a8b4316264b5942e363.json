Even the newly minted league MVP.\n\nMeesseman tied a career high with 30 points in her second consecutive exceptional performance, and the Washington Mystics beat the Las Vegas Aces 103-91 on Thursday night to take a 2-0 lead in their WNBA semifinal series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to take my shot when it goes in,\u201d said Meesseman, who hit 5 of 7 attempts from 3-point range. \u201cI know that when you kind of have the hot hand, just keep shooting. That\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nNatasha Cloud added 18 points and 11 assists for Washington, while Elena Delle Donne scored 14 points and grabbed 10 rebounds on the day she received her second MVP award.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, this kind of epitomized it,\u201d Mystics coach Mike Thibault said of Delle Donne\u2019s honor. \u201cBecause she didn\u2019t have a good shooting game, and yet, people are running to double-team her and she\u2019s finding somebody else.\u201d\n\nThe Mystics can wrap up the best-of-five series and seal a return to the WNBA Finals on Sunday in Las Vegas.\n\nLiz Cambage had 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Aces, who have lost four of five meetings against the Mystics this year between the regular season and playoffs.\n\nKelsey Plum added 19 points and 10 assists for Las Vegas, which fought back from an 11-point second-quarter deficit to take a brief lead in the third, only to fade late.\n\n\u201cThey capitalize on everything that you do, mistakes that you make,\u201d Plum said. \u201cCoach (Bill Laimbeer) always says, \u2018If you relax for a second, before you know it you\u2019re going to be down 10.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Mystics were swept by Seattle in the 2018 finals. Meesseman didn\u2019t play at all that season, taking a summer hiatus to focus on playing for the Belgian national team after helping Washington to the 2017 conference finals.\n\nIn her second time reaching this stage of the postseason, she scored what was a playoff career high of 27 points in the opener before surpassing that Thursday, when her late 3-pointer stretched the Mystics\u2019 lead to double digits for good at 98-86.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of Emma, because if you would\u2019ve looked at Emma two years ago in the Minnesota (conference final) series, we were yelling at her to shoot the ball, yelling at her to be aggressive,\u201d Cloud said. \u201cEmma is the missing piece for us. From last year to this year\u2019s team, she\u2019s the difference-maker.\u201d\n\nWashington took control with a 10-0 run in the third quarter.\n\nMeesseman hit a 3-pointer on Cloud\u2019s kickout, then fed LaToya Sanders for a layup that resulted in a three-point play. Cloud then found Kristi Toliver for another 3, before Delle Donne hit a free throw to make it 75-64. The Aces got no closer than eight afterward.\n\n\u201cWashington did what they were supposed to do, win their home games,\u201d Laimbeer said. \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nAces: Committed six first-quarter turnovers for a second consecutive game. \u2026 Plum started Game 2 after scoring 16 points and playing 31 minutes off the bench in Game 1. \u2026 Cambage picked up a technical foul with 8:06 to play.\n\nMystics: With five turnovers by halftime, exceeded their total from Game 1. \u2026 Started the same five (Delle Donne, Meesseman, Cloud, Sanders, Ariel Atkins) for a sixth consecutive game. \u2026 Delle Donne\u2019s third-quarter miss from the foul line was her first since she made 4 of 5 from the line on Aug. 8. She sank 114 of her 117 free throws (97.4 during the regular season.\n\nMVP\n\nDelle Donne accepted her MVP trophy from league commissioner Cathy Engelbert at halfcourt prior to tip-off.\n\nDuring the 2019 season, Delle Donne became the first player in WNBA history to shoot over 50% from the field, over 40% from 3-point territory and over 90% from the free throw line.\n\nSTAR POWER\n\nWashington Wizards guards John Wall and Bradley Beal and Washington Capitals right winger Tom Wilson were honorary co-captains for the Mystics. Beal wore a No. 20 Toliver jersey. The three teams share an owner, Ted Leonsis.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe best-of-five series shifts to Las Vegas Sunday for Game 3.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-Sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "So far this postseason, Emma Meesseman is outshining everyone.
