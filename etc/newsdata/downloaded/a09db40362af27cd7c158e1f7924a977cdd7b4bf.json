And surprisingly, none of them have been complete shit. So obviously, I lost my fucking mind when I saw that the official short-film \u2018Battle At Big Rock\u2018 dropped today, and so should you.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking, any film/tv franchise that\u2019s been going this long is bound to have been completely ruined for the sake of making a quick buck, but the Jurassic franchise somehow manages to avoid that every single time. They\u2019re not always cinematic masterpieces, but you never walk out of a Jurassic film regretting it.\n\nThe 8-minute short film is set a year after the events of the last film, and seems like it\u2019s a bit of a teaser for the final instalment of the film series that has consumed my life. Obviously, they weren\u2019t just going to set a bunch of killer dinosaurs free in the middle of America and not tell us what happens, right?\n\nWe\u2019re introduced to two brand spankin\u2019 new dinosaurs and get our first taste of what it\u2019s like when the dinosaurs are forced to co-exist with humans on the mainland.\n\nThe film was shot by Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow on a next-to-nothing budget in the middle of Ireland, but even on a shoestring budget, it still manages to remind you exactly how much of a fucking terrible idea it is to set a bunch of man-eating prehistoric predators loose in the middle of the US.\n\nThe final instalment in the film series, tentatively titled Jurassic World 3, is set for release sometime in 2021, so I guess this short-film will just have to satisfy your needs for the next two years.\n\nThis bad boy is only 8-minutes long, so you\u2019ve got absolutely no excuse NOT to watch it. You\u2019ve probably spent longer than that on the toilet.", "description": "Jurassic World director Colin Trevarrow just dropped a new short-film 'Battle At Big Rock' to get you excited for the third film.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Battle-at-Big-Rock-released-Allosaurus-Nasuto.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
