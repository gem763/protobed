NerdWallet has gathered what you need to know about the Black Friday shopping period.\n\nAll month: November\n\nThe start of November signals the launch of the Black Friday retail season. In the days and weeks leading up to the hyped-up shopping day, retailers try to lure customers in with teaser deals.\n\nFor example, last year, Amazon AMZN, +0.00% offered some discounts a week before Black Friday.\n\nRead: Think it\u2019s cheaper to shop online? Think again\n\nThis year, anticipate pre-Black Friday discount promotions throughout the entire month.\n\nThanksgiving: Nov. 28\n\nStill, many stores reserve their most coveted deals (the ones plastered in Black Friday ads and distributed via mass emails) for later in November.\n\nThe major players in the Black Friday arena generally don\u2019t wait until Black Friday itself to unleash their key deals. Instead, Thanksgiving Day has become the popular starting date.\n\nIn 2018, many major retailers, including Walmart, WMT, +0.57% Target TGT, +0.19% and Best Buy, BBY, +1.57% were open to shoppers on Thanksgiving. It was common for doors to open around 5 p.m.\n\nThis year, Thanksgiving is on Nov. 28. If you want a shot at the big deals, you\u2019ll need to get in line early at stores or be online by starting time.\n\nBlack Friday: Nov. 29\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving still has some heft. Last year, many stores relaunched their Black Friday sales on Black Friday itself.\n\nIf the trend continues this year, shoppers should be prepared for round two of sales on Nov. 29. Expect retailers to open during the evening on Thanksgiving, close in the early morning of Black Friday and open again later that day.\n\nCyber Monday: Dec. 2\n\nFinally, the third round of sales will launch on Cyber Monday, which falls on Dec. 2 this year. Rooted in the ease of online shopping, Cyber Monday offers discounts for consumers who want to shop from home or work.\n\nAlso see: The best time to book your holiday flights... is right now\n\nAnd in recent years, Cyber Monday has become an extension of the Black Friday shopping period with deals rolling throughout the weekend or picking up where previous sales ended.\n\nSo when is Black Friday 2019? Not just on Black Friday, but before and after, as well.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "There are several sale opportunities.
