It was a part of the monthly budget to snake the toilet once a month. They replaced the kitchen floor four times over the last 10 years, Mr. Elvarat said.\n\nLast year, Mr. Vlotnicki decided he wanted to retire and sell the Silver Spring restaurant to someone willing to continue operating the Woodside Deli.\n\nThe owners began renegotiating the lease last year, but the landlord was unwilling to bear the cost of maintenance, which Mr. Elvarat said would be nearly a half-million dollars to comply with building codes.\n\nAfter continuing the lease on two-week increments since July, the cost of legal fees, future maintenance and the short-term leases became unsustainable and the owners notified the landlord of their intention to close the business.\n\n\u201cI am not sour with the landlord, he is doing his job and covering his interests, I understand where he comes from,\u201d Mr. Elvarat said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame we couldn\u2019t come to an agreement.\u201d\n\nGaithersburg resident Lori Shell said she had gone to the deli since she was a kid, but had been a regular customer for the last 16 years.\n\n\u201cIt was a landmark here. It had been around for so long, it was more like a \u2018Cheers\u2019 environment where everybody knows your name,\u201d Mrs. Shell said.\n\nMrs. Elvarat said her father wanted to create a business culture to express gratitude to the customers and the community.\n\n\u201cHe came here from Israel and he was given such an opportunity, and he always wanted to give back and say thank you to America and the community in Silver Spring,\u201d Mrs. Elvarat said.\n\nMr. Elvarat said they regularly donated canceled catering orders and hot meals to shelters in the area and gave food and money to events at local schools, the police and fire departments, and fundraising events.\n\nMr. Vlotnicki expanded the business to a Rockville location at 4 N. Washington St., and Ms. Elvarat and her husband opened a Germantown location, which they no longer own.\n\n\u201cThank God we still have the Rockville location,\u201d Ms. Elvarat said, adding that they will operate the catering business there.\n\nOf the 21 employees who worked at Silver Spring, four now work at Rockville and five others will join them after the hours of operation are extended to 9 p.m. starting Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cMy wife is crying about it, she grew up in this business,\u201d Mr. Elvarat said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
