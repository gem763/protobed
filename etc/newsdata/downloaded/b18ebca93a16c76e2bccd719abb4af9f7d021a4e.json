Jean, who was 26 when he died, would have turned 28 last Sunday.\n\nIn extraordinary scenes in the courtroom a few minutes after the sentence was handed out, the victim\u2019s brother, Brandt, said he forgave Guyger.\n\n\u201cI love you just like anyone else, I\u2019m not going to say I hope you rot and die just like my brother did, but I personally want the best for you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ever say this in front of my family or anyone but I don\u2019t even want you to go to jail, I want the best for you because I know that\u2019s exactly what Botham would want \u2026 and the best would be, give your life to Christ.\u201d\n\nAfter asking permission from Judge Tammy Kemp, Brandt Jean walked across the room to hug Guyger. Kemp also hugged her, after speaking with and embracing Jean\u2019s family members.\n\nAfter Brandt Jean\u2019s gesture, Kemp herself went over to where Guyger sat and, opening a Bible to John 3:16, said: \u201cThis is where you start.\u201d Then they hugged.\n\nIn a press conference, John Creuzot, the Dallas county district attorney, described the embraces as an \u201camazing act of healing\u201d. He said of the sentence: \u201cPersonally I expected perhaps longer but I respect what [the jury] did \u2026 they reached what they thought was a just verdict.\u201d\n\nI love you just like anyone else, I\u2019m not going to say I hope you rot and die just like my brother did Brandt Jean\n\nGuyger was convicted on Tuesday of murdering the accountant, who was watching television on his couch and eating vanilla ice cream when she shot him on the night of 6 September 2018. Lawyers for Jean\u2019s family described the unanimous verdict as a landmark in the national fight to hold police accountable for the killings of unarmed black people.\n\nThe trial then moved to the sentencing phase. Prosecutors showed the jury derisive text messages Guyger sent about working a Martin Luther King Day parade in 2018. Responding to a message that asked \u201cWhen does this end lol,\u201d she wrote: \u201cWhen MLK is dead\u2026 oh wait\u2026\u201d\n\nShe also suggested that the crowd could be pushed or pepper-sprayed because she felt the parade was lengthy.\n\nMartin Rivera, her former partner on the force and former lover, texted her in March, 2018, writing: \u201cDamn I was at this area with 5 different black officers !!! Not racist but damn.\u201d Guyger responded: \u201cNot racist but just have a different way of working and it shows.\u201d In another conversation two days before the shooting, a friend discusses a dog that \u201cmay be racist\u201d. Guyger replies: \u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026 I\u2019m the same\u2026 I hate everything and everyone but y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nThe 12-person jury was shown memes and quotations she saved on a social media account, such as \u201cI wear all black to remind you not to mess with me, because I\u2019m already dressed for your funeral\u201d, and an image of a Minion character from the Despicable Me films with the text: \u201cPeople are so ungrateful. No one ever thanks me for having the patience not to kill them.\u201d\n\nThe jury deliberated for about an hour before returning their sentence. In marked contrast with the cheers that followed the guilty verdict on Tuesday, community activists reacted with anger outside the courtroom after the sentence, telling reporters that it was far too lenient.\n\nI never wanted to take an innocent person\u2019s life. And I\u2019m so sorry Amber Guyger\n\nThe 31-year-old faced up to 99 years in prison. She claimed she was tired after a long work day and mistakenly went to the apartment directly above her own at the complex in central Dallas, then killed Jean because she thought he was a dangerous intruder.\n\nGuyger denied she is racist. When she fired two shots from her service weapon while off-duty but in uniform, hitting Jean once in the chest, she said she was acting in self-defence because she thought her life was under immediate threat from a burglar.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to take an innocent person\u2019s life. And I\u2019m so sorry. This is not about hate. It\u2019s about being scared that night,\u201d she testified last week.\n\nShe was fired from the Dallas police department. Friends and members of Guyger\u2019s family testified on Wednesday that she is a kind person who feels profoundly guilty and remorseful. Her defence team argued that the text messages and posts did not reflect her true character.\n\nJean\u2019s mother testified that she has endured \u201cthe most terrible time\u201d.\n\n\u201cI cannot sleep. I cannot eat,\u201d Allison Jean said. She was dressed in red, her son\u2019s favourite colour.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Allison Jean, the mother of Botham Jean, speaks during a news conference. Photograph: Tony Gutierrez/AP\n\nEchoing critics who alleged that police gave Guyger preferential treatment in the aftermath of the shooting, Allison accused law enforcement of \u201ccorruption\u201d in the way they handled the crime scene. \u201cThat 10 years in prison is for her reflection and for her to change her life, but there is much more to be done by the city of Dallas,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nShe also criticised the department\u2019s training standards. \u201cIf Amber Guyger was trained not to shoot in the heart, my son would be standing here today. He was no threat to her. He had no reason to cause a threat to her because he was in his own apartment, in his sanctuary,\u201d she said. \u201cHis privacy was violated, she intruded on him, and that was not enough \u2013 she killed him.\u201d\n\nRenee Hall, the Dallas police chief, told reporters: \u201cSworn testimony revealed things during this trial that gave me concern,\u201d adding, \u201cI acknowledge that there are things that we need to change.\u201d\n\nA close friend, Alexis Stossel, told the court Jean would text her basketball news and that he was a \u201cnatural leader\u201d who led worship as a student at Harding University, a Christian institution in Arkansas. He landed a job with PwC in Dallas.\n\n\u201cPeople gravitated towards him. You just felt welcomed by his presence,\u201d Stossel said. She wept as she recalled receiving a call on the morning after his death and slumping to the floor screaming \u201cwait, wait, wait\u201d at the news he had been fatally shot.\n\n\u201cI had never lost someone this close in my life and the feeling is just unexplainable,\u201d she said. In disbelief, she \u201ccalled him seven times and there was no answer\u201d.\n\nBertrum Jean described a deep father-son bond and how they communicated via WhatsApp once Botham moved to the US from his native St Lucia. They talked every Sunday after Botham attended church. Now, his father said, \u201cSundays are not a good day for me, because I\u2019m not hearing his voice.\u201d\n\nWiping away tears, he added: \u201cI\u2019ll never see him again and I still want to see him.\u201d He said his son was \u201cSuch a sweet boy. He tried his best to live a good honest life. He loved God, he loved everyone. How could this happen to him?\u201d", "description": "After sentence handed down, brother of Botham Jean hugs woman who killed him", "authors": ["Tom Dart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc64742a3d3f9dcfdf9ed2cf9036603ab16e521a/52_25_2023_1213/master/2023.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eb0cafab0b7198f676f5842bdbf33efe"}
