But everyone should feel responsible. Arsenal lose 12 to 15 points per season by set pieces. That should stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If you want to play for the first couple of places you have to sort it out, you have to find a way.\u2019\n\n\"I don't think Emery really connects with his players.\" Are Arsenal improving under Unai Emery? \ud83e\udd14 Robin van @Persie_Official doesn't think so and tells us exactly why\u2026 pic.twitter.com/GmbLwNimr4 \u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) October 24, 2019\n\nVan Persie expanded on his point, suggesting that Emery is not a \u2018strong coach\u2019 which leads to players not putting in enough effort in games.\n\n\u2018As a player you want to have that feeling, you have to sprint back, now I see a couple of players jogging back, and there\u2019s danger there,\u2019 said Van Persie. \u2018I don\u2019t feel that in the team.\n\n\u2018If you have a very strong coach, and you are in midfield and you see danger somewhere, you sprint for your life, because you know if you don\u2019t do it you get punished.\u2019\n\nVan Persie had a good relationship with Arsene Wenger at Arsenal (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe Dutchman\u2019s final criticism came for Emery\u2019s lack of clarity, citing a training ground video which was published, showing the Spaniard shouting instructions at his players.\n\nVan Persie admitted that he couldn\u2019t understand what the Arsenal boss was saying, and that compared to other great managers he has played under, this will leave Emery falling short.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had [Arsene] Wenger, Louis van Gaal, [Alex] Ferguson, I had so many coaches, and their main quality was to be clear,\u2019 said the 36-year-old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If I\u2019m really honest\u2026someone sent me a video last week of him [Emery] trying to explain something, and I couldn\u2019t really figure out if he was saying, \u2018calm, calm\u2019 or \u2018come, come.\u2019\n\n\u2018That is very important, you have to be clear, you have to be the leader and the leader needs to be clear towards his players.\u2019\n\nEmery: \u201c\u00d6zil doesn\u2019t work hard in training\u201d Emery\u2019s training sessions: pic.twitter.com/S5sIjHcSpY \u2014 Sai Descoteaux (@knickthoughts) October 21, 2019\n\nThe late Pepe double has eased pressure on Emery for now, but failure to beat Crystal Palace in the Premier League this weekend would raise questions over his leadership again.\n\nBT Sport provided the statistic on the broadcast that Arsenal\u2019s last 47 games under Wenger produced 26 wins, while the first 47 under Emery produced 25 wins.\n\nIf results continue to be inconsistent then the question of whether they are an improving side will be difficult to answer for the Spaniard.\n\nMORE: Nicolas Pepe saves the day for Arsenal with two stunning free-kicks in late win over Vitoria Guimaraes\n\nMORE: Ainsley Maitland-Niles is \u2018wasting his talent,\u2019 says Arsenal legend Martin Keown", "description": "Robin van Persie has heavily criticised Arsenal manager Unai Emery, saying he does not connect with his players and cannot give them clear instructions.
