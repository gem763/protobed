On the one hand, the bill has the support of President Trump Donald John TrumpKey witness in impeachment investigation asks federal judge to rule on testifying Pompeo voices support for work of diplomat criticized by Trump Biden, Sanders defend themselves over questions of age MORE, and lowering drug prices is a popular issue with voters. But on the other hand, supporting the bill breaks with GOP orthodoxy and invites a backlash from both conservatives and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe most controversial provision for Republicans requires drug companies to pay money back to Medicare if their prices rise faster than inflation, something some Republicans view as too close to a \u201cprice control.\u201d\n\nTillis told The Hill that he has \u201cconcerns\u201d with the bill, saying that he wants to focus on middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers and other parts of the supply chain, not just pharmaceutical companies themselves to lower drug prices.\n\n\u201cI think we need to make progress on [the bill],\u201d Tillis said, while adding he has not made a final decision on how he would vote if the bill came to the floor.\n\nMcSally has also expressed concerns, declining to say if she would support the bill in an interview with The Arizona Republic in August.\n\n\"There are a lot of really good things in that legislation and we're making sure there's not any unintended consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we appreciate the intent. We definitely support the intent.\"\n\nA McSally aide said Friday that the senator \u201chas been in close discussions\u201d with Grassley, but did not give a firm position on the measure either way.\n\nGardner\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether he supports the bill.\n\nErnst, Grassley\u2019s fellow Iowan, has also so far declined to endorse the bill.\n\n\u201cSenator Grassley and Senator Ernst share the same goal of lowering the cost of prescription drugs for their fellow Iowans, and on this particular bill, Senator Ernst generally supports the intent of the package and is still reviewing the specifics of the proposal,\u201d said Ernst spokeswoman Kelsi Daniell.\n\nThe wavering from GOP senators comes despite support from Trump, who frequently rails against high drug prices.\n\n\u201cI like Sen. Grassley\u2019s drug pricing bill very much,\u201d Trump tweeted last month.\n\nBecause of my Administration, drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years \u2014 but the American people need Congress to help. I like Sen. Grassley\u2019s drug pricing bill very much, and it\u2019s great to see Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill today. Let\u2019s get it done in a bipartisan way! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019\n\nLowering drug prices is also a major issue for voters. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in September found that 70 percent of the public said lowering drug prices should be a \u201ctop priority.\u201d\n\nBut conservative groups have attacked the bill for its limits on price increases in Medicare, and FreedomWorks called the idea \u201cprice controls\u201d in July.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to put our nation on the slippery slope towards socialized medicine,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Adam Brandon, said at the time.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry \u2014 a powerful force in Washington and a major source of campaign contributions \u2014 is also staunchly opposed to the bill.\n\nSome vulnerable Republican senators are pointing to smaller, less controversial bills to show their commitment to lowering drug prices.\n\nErnst and McSally, for example, point to their support for the Creates Act, a smaller bipartisan measure aimed at lowering drug prices by cracking down on delay tactics that drug companies use to fend off competition from cheaper generic drugs.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry also supports that measure, helping make it less controversial than the Grassley-Wyden bill.\n\nGrassley last month publicly called on McConnell to support his bill, arguing that it would help Republicans keep control of the Senate in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nHe's pitched his bill to Republicans as the \u201cmoderate\u201d alternative to Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi: Court ruling 'another blow' to President Trump Elijah Cummings, native son of Baltimore, gets emotional send-off from Democratic luminaries Cummings' staff honor him in op-ed: He brought 'moral clarity' MORE\u2019s (D-Calif.) drug pricing measure in the House, which is far more sweeping but has at least some chance of receiving Trump's support given his focus on drug costs.\n\n\u201cThere's a great deal of disgust with the rapidly increasing price of drugs, and every Republican up for election's going to have to have a place to land,\u201d Grassley told reporters in September.\n\n\u201cAnd this is the place to land, because they're surely not going to land with what Pelosi's [doing],\" he continued. \"If McConnell wants to keep the Republican majority, then this drug pricing bill is part of that plan.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGrassley spokesman Michael Zona said Friday that support is growing, and more Republican supporters will be announced \u201cin the coming days.\u201d\n\nAsked about the path forward for Grassley\u2019s bill and whether it would get a vote, McConnell\u2019s office referred back to the Leader\u2019s comments to Politico last month, where he said the path forward is still \u201cunder discussion\u201d and the Senate is still \u201clooking at doing something on drug pricing.\u201d\n\nHowever, given the bill's ability to divide McConnell's caucus, he could be hesitant to give it a vote.\n\nMany lobbyists expect that Grassley\u2019s bill will not come up for a vote as a standalone measure, and that its only chance is to have sections included in a larger package, such as a government funding deal. However, that could be a more likely scenario for smaller measures like the Creates Act.\n\nWith the election ahead, both sides are already throwing jabs over the issue.\n\n\u201cVoters are worried about prescription drugs getting more expensive, but many Republican incumbents on the ballot haven't taken meaningful steps to bring down prices and are now dodging questions about legislation,\u201d said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss.\n\nJesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, countered that Republicans \u201care firmly committed to addressing the rising cost of prescription drugs through a variety of different measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese attacks from Democrats are nothing more than an effort to distract voters from their Party\u2019s embrace of plans that would eliminate employer-based health care coverage,\u201d he added.", "description": "Vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection next year are giving the cold shoulder to a bipartisan bill aimed at lowering drug prices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/drugprices_102519istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
