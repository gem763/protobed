I needed to get some energy going but you can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t play any good shots and Nick was playing very well.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to stay focused. If you can turn the momentum, the crowd gets back into it and I need some earplugs next time, it was just phenomenal.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nadal and doubles partner Stefanos Tsitsipas were beaten 6-4 3-6 10-6 by Kyrgios and Jack Sock in the final match of the day as Team World narrowed Europe\u2019s lead to 7-5.\n\nThe first team to reach 13 points will be crowned champions, with each win worth three points on Sunday.\n\nJohn Isner scored a 6-7(2) 6-4 10-1 win over German Alexander Zverev in the opening match of day two to help Team World draw level with Team Europe at three points apiece.\n\nWith two points up for grabs for victories on the second day of the tournament in Geneva, Zverev looked on course to extend Europe\u2019s 3-1 lead from Friday after edging a tight first set in the tiebreak.\n\nHowever, the towering Isner battled back in the second set and broke to go ahead 5-4 with a lunging volley, then dragged the contest into a decider which he dominated.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t making any inroads on his serve at all and he was the better player for 85% of that match,\u201d American Isner said.\n\n\u201cOf course, I got a little lucky at 4-4 but once I got up 5-4, I had a lot of momentum, and I think I showed that in the tiebreaker.\u201d", "description": "Roger Federer maintained his 100% Laver Cup record against Nick Kyrgios on Saturday with a thrilling 6-7(5) 7-5 10-7 win over the Australian but Team World hit back in the doubles match later on to stay in contention for the title.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432366744&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0LJ", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
