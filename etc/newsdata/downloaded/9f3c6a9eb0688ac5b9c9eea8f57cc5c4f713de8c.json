That, in turn, led to the postponement Saturday of a vote on the Brexit deal that Johnson agreed upon with EU leaders on Thursday.\n\nStarmer says what Labour is seeking now is that \u201cthis deal in particular but any deal is put up against remain in a referendum.\u201d\n\nHundreds of thousands of people marched through London on Saturday demanding a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d on Brexit.\n\n___\n\n10:40 a.m.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has met with EU ambassadors to discuss the consequences of the letter sent by British Prime minister Boris Johnson asking for a Brexit extension.\n\nAsked Sunday after the meeting in Brussels whether EU leaders would be open to granting a new Brexit delay, Barnier just said EU Council President Donald Tusk would hold consultations \u201cin the next days.\u201d\n\nBarnier said it was \u201ca very short and normal meeting\u201d to \u201claunch the next steps of the EU ratification of the agreement.\u201d\n\nJohnson sent an unsigned letter to the European Union late Saturday seeking a delay to Britain\u2019s impending Oct. 31 departure from the bloc, as required by British law. But he followed it with a signed letter indicating that he does not favor another Brexit extension.\n\nJohnson very much wants Britain to leave the bloc on Oct. 31 but British lawmakers have not yet voted on his new Brexit plan.\n\n___\n\n10:20 a.m.\n\nA German minister is calling on British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek a cross-party solution to the Brexit standoff and says he wouldn\u2019t have a problem with delaying Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union for a few weeks.\n\nEconomy Minister Peter Altmaier, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s party, was quoted Sunday as telling German daily Bild that \u201ca good and orderly solution is still possible if Boris Johnson now reaches out to Parliament and seeks a cross-party solution.\u201d\n\nHe says Britain\u2019s continued political \u201cpower poker\u201d game over Brexit endangers jobs and prosperity, and \u201cif an extension by a few weeks is necessary, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d\n\nThe European Union has not yet responded to Johnson\u2019s grudging request late Saturday to extend the looming Oct. 31 deadline for Britain to leave the bloc.\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing a legal challenge from opponents over his Brexit plan.\n\nJohnson sent an unsigned letter to the European Union late Saturday seeking a delay to Britain\u2019s impending departure from the bloc, as required by law. But he followed it with a signed letter indicating that he does not favor another Brexit extension.\n\nEU officials have not responded to the request and say consultations are underway.\n\nOpponents feel that sending the second letter was done specifically to frustrate the will of Parliament, which has not approved Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan but does want a Brexit deal.\n\nThe Court of Session in Scotland is already considering the matter, and it may end up being decided in the British Supreme Court, which in September ruled that Johnson had acted unlawfully when he suspended Parliament for five weeks as the Brexit deadline crept closer.\n\nScottish National Party legislator Joanna Cherry said the legal battle over Brexit resumes Monday to see \u201cif the prime minister has flouted the law and the promises he gave to the court.\u201d\n\n___\n\n9 a.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pressing ahead to try to win parliamentary backing for his new Brexit deal even as the European Union considers his grudging request to extend the looming Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nJohnson sent an unsigned letter to the EU late Saturday seeking a delay to Britain\u2019s impending departure from the bloc, as required by law. But he followed it with a signed letter indicating that he does not favor another Brexit extension.\n\nEU officials have not responded to the request and say consultations are underway. The formal granting or denial of an extension by the bloc may not be made until the Brexit deadline is just a few days away, but most signs indicate the EU would prefer an extension to an abrupt U.K. departure from the bloc without a deal in place.\n\nJohnson has been determined to take the country out of the 28-nation bloc on Oct. 31, but lawmakers are trying to avoid a no-deal Brexit, which economists say would wreak damage on the U.K. economy.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Britain's impending departure from the European Union (all times local): 11:10 a.m. The opposition Labour Party's Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/20/06d8c2_aptopix-britain-brexit-00858-anti-brexit-remain-in-european-union-supporters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
