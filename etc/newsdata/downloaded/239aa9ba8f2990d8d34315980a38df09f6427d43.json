It wasn't like they played through us or anything like that.\n\n\"We go back to the drawing board. The international break (is) now time for us to regroup. We believe in what we're doing, in time it will come.\n\n\"Now it's just that tough phase. The next game we look forward to is Liverpool. We definitely want to get a result in that game.\n\n\"It's always a big game. Through my academy stages, Liverpool is a must-win. It's a brutal game. It wasn't a tippy-tappy game, no matter what age group.\n\n\"Obviously coming here to the first team, I expect more of the same. It will be a game where we need to grind it out and stick together and produce a result.\"\n\nLiverpool will be a huge challenge for Solskjaer's side.\n\nTop of the table and 15 points ahead of United after just eight matches, Jurgen Klopp's men will head to Old Trafford looking for a record-equalling 18th successive Premier League win.\n\nSolskjaer will be hoping his injury issues ease ahead of that match, given Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw were ruled out at Newcastle.\n\n\"Obviously, we're waiting for players to come back and that will be a positive to strengthen the squad again,\" Tuanzebe told MUTV.\n\n\"(It) gives us time to reflect and build on our game because again we're having a lot of possession, but we need to have that penetration in the final third (to) give us chances to win games.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Axel Tuanzebe says Manchester United need to \"go back to the drawing board\" after Sunday's chastening loss at Newcastle United.", "authors": ["Simon Peach"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/10/axel-tuanzebe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
