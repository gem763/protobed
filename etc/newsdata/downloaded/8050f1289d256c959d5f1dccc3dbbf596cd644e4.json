The United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that on the one hand you are trying to seek to have a trade deal, on the other hand you are making use of any issues, especially human rights issues, to blame the others,\" China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters.\n\nHe said there was \"progress\" in the trade talks. But he said of the US criticism of China at the United Nations: \"I do not think its helpful for having a good solution to the issue of trade talks.\"\n\nUS and Chinese negotiators are working to complete the text of an interim trade agreement for US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile in mid-November.\n\nA US administration official said on Wednesday (AEDT) it might not be completed in time for signing in Chile, but that does not mean the accord is falling apart.", "description": "China has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in remote Xinjiang that it describes as 'vocational training centres' to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f14cc10c0cc1d6a514eb7e1dc6e6b30605a9cd72", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
