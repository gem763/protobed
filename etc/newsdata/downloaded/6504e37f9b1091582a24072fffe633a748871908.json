Here are five charts that shed more light on the granular impact.\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nBrent futures soared as much as $11.73 a barrel in intraday trading, the biggest increase since the contract launched in 1988. The global benchmark surged as much as 19.48% in percentage terms, the biggest jump since the first Gulf War in 1991.\n\nScale of Disruption\n\nThe estimated 5.7 million barrels a day of lost Saudi production is the single biggest sudden disruption on record. It surpasses the loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi supply during the Gulf War in August 1990, and the hit to Iranian output in 1979 from the Islamic Revolution, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nTiming is Everything\n\nBecause the loss of oil is sudden, the impact is being felt more heavily in contracts for near-term delivery than further down the curve. The price gap between Brent for delivery this November and December 2020 doubled from $3.57 a barrel at the close of trading Friday to more than $7 on Monday.\n\nProtection Money\n\nThe options market shows traders are still nervous that prices will risen even further, and are now paying up to protect against it. Calls on West Texas Intermediate crude futures are pricier than puts for the first time since 2018.\n\nLocation, Location, Location\n\nGlobal oil prices are feeling the impact of the attack more intensely than those in the U.S., where the benchmark is slightly buffered by being delivered to a land-locked oil hub in Oklahoma. Brent\u2019s premium to West Texas Intermediate widened as much as 37% to $7.40 a barrel, the biggest gap since July.\n\n--With assistance from Javier Blas and David Marino.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Dan Murtaugh in Singapore at dmurtaugh@bloomberg.net;Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ramsey Al-Rikabi at ralrikabi@bloomberg.net, Andrew Janes\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The record surge in Brent crude futures on Monday only tells part of the story of how the oil market is reacting to a strike on a Saudi Arabian oil facility that\u2019s removed about 5% of global supplies.
