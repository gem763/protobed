In addition, the company \u2014 formerly known has Lending Express \u2014 has raised $2.5 million in venture debt.\n\nThe round is led by Benson Oak Ventures and Magenta Venture, with participation from RIO Ventures Holdings, iAngels, and Entr\u00e9e Capital. The debt funding is provided by Viola Credit.\n\nClaiming that the small business lending landscape is \u201cfundamentally flawed,\u201d with 58% of SMBs denied access to funding, Become\u2019s platform uses technology to give each business a \u201cLendingScore\u201d based on how fundable its algorithms think it is. This is supported by a personalised plan and monitoring system to help SMBs become more transparent and therefore viable to lenders.\n\nThe Become marketplace then allows multiple lenders to offer tailored offers to the businesses registered on the platform and compete for an SMB\u2019s custom. \u201cThis gives each SMB the power to compare and choose the loan that\u2019s right for them, directly from Become\u2019s platform,\u201d says the fintech.\n\n\u201cThe lending sector is fundamentally flawed, with many SMBs unable to get loans,\u201d explains Become founder and CEO Eden Amirav. \u201cThe process of applying for a loan is often time consuming and confusing, and big bank approval rating sits at just 27.5%\u201d.\n\nTo compound this, he says that the lending market is fragmented, consisting of hundreds of alternative lenders, and SMBs don\u2019t know which to choose. \u201cWithout the tools to navigate, many end up contacting the wrong lender. There may be some lenders, for example, that have a better loan product or rate that better suits their business.\n\nFinally, the lack of transparency throughout the process leaves SMBs completely in the dark. If denied funding, SMBs don\u2019t know exactly why or how to qualify\u201d.\n\nTo remedy this, Become lets SMBs view all of funding options in a single place so that they can make a \u201cfinancially savvy\u201d decision after careful comparison. The entire process is online from start to finish, with Amirav claiming that funding is made possible in as little as 3 hours. \u201cBecome\u2019s LendingScore improves business\u2019s fundability in order to help them qualify for more and better funding options,\u201d he adds.\n\nWith regards to competitors, Become competes with both lending marketplaces and business profiling products. The former includes Fundera and Lendio, while Nav is a competitor in the business credit profiling space.\n\n\u201cWhat sets Become apart is that [we are the] only truly online marketplace from start to finish,\u201d says Amirav. \u201cFor the first time, the whole process from application to funding can be completed entirely online, using [our] API, and without the need for offline activity. Become\u2019s technology continues to search for optimal funding options and notifies customers if more suitable, better options are available\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Become says it will use the funds to scale its operations in the U.S. and Australia.\n\nIt claims 200,000 business owners registered on its platform, supported by an ecosystem of more than 50 lenders and partners including Paypal, OnDeck and Kabbage. The fintech, which has offices in San Francisco and Tel Aviv, has facilitated over $165 million in business loans to date.", "description": "Become, the Israeli startup that operates a business lending marketplace to give SMBs more funding options, has closed $10 million in Series A investment.
