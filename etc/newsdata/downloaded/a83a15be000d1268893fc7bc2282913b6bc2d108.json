That can be true even if they find the device.\n\nWhether it's nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oil, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, or both, teens need to quit. That's far easier said than done.\n\nPediatric pulmonologist Dr. Sunil Kapoor saw firsthand the pull of vaping both substances when an an asthmatic teen patient was back in his office this month, a year after he spent a week in the hospital for his vaping. The boy's school told his father the 16-year-old was vaping nicotine in the bathroom, but he was vaping THC as well.\n\nSketchy THC vape products. Sneaky teens. How patchwork regulations on e-cigarettes led to health crisis\n\n\"You\u2019re driving me a little bit crazy,\" Kapoor, chief of pediatric pulmonology at Inova Children\u2019s Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia, recalls telling him. \"You were in the intensive care unit. Why?\"\n\nHere are tips for parents worried about their kids and vaping:\n\nWhat is vaping?\n\nElectronic cigarettes and Juuls, the most popular brand name for young people, have a battery, a heating element and a place to hold a liquid, known as e-liquid or vape juice, which is typically flavored. The heat creates a vapor, or aerosol, that users inhale. These devices can also be used with THC or cannabidiol (CBD), which can legally contain .03% of THC to be sold in stores or higher levels if sold in dispensaries. While e-cigarette cartridges can be purchased with a wide variety of nicotine levels down to 0%, Juuls have a high level of nicotine \u2013 as much as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes.\n\nHow do I know if my child is vaping? Are there symptoms?\n\nShort of finding the device or catching kids in the act, you may not. But some key signs include frequently stepping away from family, leaving to go outside or to the bathroom in school and anywhere else they could sneak a vape, says Carol Riccio, the nurse leader for the Newburyport, Massachusetts, school district.\n\nIrritability is another key indicator, although teasing out when it's attributable to vaping versus simply being teens can be difficult, Kapoor says. Excessive coughing, shortness of breath and increasing intolerance to exercise should raise suspicion as well, he says.\n\nSome children show up in school nurses' offices suffering from \"nicotine toxicity\" because of near-constant puffing on the devices, says Laurie Combe, president of the National Association of School Nurses. Signs that kids may have ingested too much nicotine include nausea, vomiting and fluctuating blood pressure, she says.\n\nI found a vape device. How do I know what's in it?\n\nIt can be very difficult to tell the difference between nicotine e-liquid and THC or a CBD-based oil. A legally purchased cartridge with THC or CBD oil or nicotine would have some sort of packaging or labeling saying what it is. But even Juul-brand cartridges, which are supposed to be \"closed loop\" so nothing can be added, are often tampered with and filled with THC-based oils.\n\nGregory Conley, founder of the American Vaping Association, shows the tobacco vaping cartridge he uses to highlight the difference between it and THC vape pens. The e-liquid is thinner than THC oil. More\n\nNarrow cylinder-shaped vials are more likely to contain THC oil; nicotine ones tend to be wider and bigger, as American Vapor Association President Gregory Conley demonstrated Friday with his Njoy device. THC is thick and oil based so may not appear to move in the cartridge while nicotine e-liquid would flow freely in the cartridge.", "description": "If you find your teen is vaping, what should you do?
