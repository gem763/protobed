That's lower than the extremely profitable first quarter hospitals had, but above average for the entire group.\n\n17 of the 55 companies in the analysis that had net margins of at least 10% in Q2 were not-for-profit hospital systems.\n\nThe big picture: The profits don't just lead to hefty paydays. They allow the industry to amass a war chest to fend off piecemeal reforms and larger-scale overhauls like Medicare for All.", "description": "Relatedly, people are still mad about drug prices and surprise bills.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Gfm4MoHaZDbLPRMfz9g-VbvFXic=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/18/1568832487077.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
