(Christophe Genty/Christophe Genty Photography)\n\nVirginia will no longer require couples to identify by race on their marriage licenses, the state\u2019s attorney general announced this week.\n\nUnder a new policy \u2014 which Attorney General Mark Herring detailed in emails to court clerks and members of the media late Friday \u2014 people getting married will be able to select \u201cDeclined to Answer\u201d in a box asking about race. Herring also told clerks they must issue a marriage license \u201cregardless of an applicant\u2019s answer or non-answer to that inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe new guidance comes about a week after three couples filed a federal lawsuit alleging the required disclosure of race is unconstitutional because it violates the First, 13th and 14th amendments.\n\n\u201cWe were happy to help quickly resolve this issue and get these couples what they asked for,\u201d Herring said in his statement. \u201cThese changes will ensure that no Virginian will be forced to label themselves to get married.\u201d\n\n[\u2018Aryan\u2019 and \u2018Octoroon\u2019: Couples challenge racial labels to get married in Virginia]\n\nThe plaintiffs, however, said in interviews Saturday that they do not see the issue as \u201cresolved.\u201d Though appreciative of the new guidance, the couples and their lawyer said they plan to continue pressing the case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good first step, but as far as we know the case is still going to go forward and we\u2019re hoping the judge doesn\u2019t declare it moot,\u201d said Ashley Ramkishun, one of the plaintiffs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t resolve the fact that there\u2019s still a law in place in Virginia \u2014 the state could change its mind at any point in regards to whether the race question is optional or not.\u201d\n\nVictor Glasberg, the couples\u2019 lawyer, said in an interview Saturday that he thinks it unlikely the judge, Rossie D. Alston Jr., will seek to dismiss the suit. But if he does, Glasberg will appeal the dismissal. Glasberg discussed Herring\u2019s new instructions with the plaintiffs over the weekend, and none of them want to back out, he said.\n\nGlasberg quoted verbatim the text of the Virginia statute, still on the books, that mandates the disclosure of race. It declares in part that, \u201cfor each marriage performed in the Commonwealth, a record showing personal data, including but not limited to age and race of the married parties . . . shall be filed with the State Registrar.\u201d\n\nGlasberg vowed to continue with the litigation until that law is ruled unconstitutional and stricken from the record.\n\nHerring\u2019s guidance \u201cis welcome, it\u2019s much appreciated, and it\u2019s the right thing to do as an initial response,\u201d Glasberg said. \u201cBut the statute is obnoxious and . . . we need to get rid of the statute.\u201d\n\nAlthough marriage license forms in Virginia can vary by county, the majority offer five options for racial identification: white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Some also include the denominations \u201cother\u201d or \u201cmixed.\u201d Filling out the form with false information counts as a felony.\n\nThe mandated disclosure of race is a legacy of Virginia\u2019s ban on interracial marriage, established almost 100 years ago and struck down by the Supreme Court in the famous case Loving v. Virginia. Glasberg and the couples argue the law is a racist holdover and a lingering symbol of segregation that has no place in today\u2019s society.\n\n[He helped make legal history in Loving v. Virginia. At 80, he\u2019s still fighting for justice.]\n\nWhile people should be free to identify by race, they should not be forced to do so, the couples say.\n\n\u201cThe requirement to identify by \u2018race\u2019 uses terms grounded in ignorance and bigotry, not in science,\u201d reads the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Alexandria. \u201cWe are free to define ourselves as we wish.\u201d\n\nGlasberg previously told The Washington Post that he believes his suit is the first to allege the collection of racial data on marriage licenses is unconstitutional. Though the Supreme Court has ruled against laws that discriminate based on race in the past, it has never judged racial categories to be in violation of the constitution.\n\nBrandyn Churchill, another plaintiff, said he is just as determined as Ramkishun to proceed with the lawsuit. But Churchill added that the new policy \u2014 its release happened to coincide with his fiancee Sophie Roger\u2019s 23rd birthday Friday \u2014 came as a big relief.\n\nChurchill and Rogers are planning to wed on Oct. 19. The couple hit a serious roadblock when they applied for a marriage license in Rockbridge County and were told they could not say \u201cI do\u201d unless both selected their races from a list that included the labels \u201cAryan\u201d and \u201cOctoroon.\u201d Unwilling to obey, Churchill and Rogers decided to join the lawsuit instead, leaving the fate of their wedding in limbo.\n\n\u201cWe will still continue to fight, but this was a welcome first step, in part because now we can get married,\u201d Churchill said Saturday. \u201cIn that sense, the Commonwealth just gave Sophie a little bit of a birthday present.\u201d", "description": "The new guidance comes about a week after three couples filed a federal lawsuit alleging the required disclosure of race is unconstitutional.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
