Let me tell you something, black transwomen are dying! Our lives matter! I am an extraordinary black transwoman, and I deserve to be here!\" activist Blossom Brown said on Thursday.\n\n\"My black transsisters that are here. I am so tired of \u2014 it\u2019s not just my black transwomen and black transbrothers too. I\u2019m going to say what I\u2019m going to say,\" she added.\n\nBrown continued her rant even after moderator Don Lemon asked for the microphone,\"Black trans women are being killed in this country! Black trans women are dying and our lives matter! Not one black trans woman or man has been given the mic tonight.\"\n\nLemon assured Brown that the network and the audience wanted to hear from people like her.\n\nEarlier in the evening, trans rights activists interrupted candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg right as he was being asked his first question.\n\n\"Let me just \u2014 let me just point out there is a long and proud tradition in history in the gay and lesbian and transgendered community of protest, and we applaud them for their protest,\" moderator Anderson Cooper said to the protesters. \"And they are absolutely right to be angry and upset at the lack of attention, particularly in the media on the lives of transgendered.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/10/2019 23:55:31PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/283/a9cca55b-0ada-4fde-8741-7f7a0a6fff05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
