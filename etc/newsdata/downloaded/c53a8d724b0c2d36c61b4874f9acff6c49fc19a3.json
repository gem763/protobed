She now holds the role of Personal Advisor, Curator and Senior Dresser to Her Majesty The Queen (The Queen\u2019s Jewellery, Insignias and Wardrobe), as well as in-house designer.

Magazine exclusively shared several excerpts from the new book ahead of its release, revealing how Kelly was able to achieve the look behind the royal baby christening gown that all royal babies since 2008 have worn.\n\nIn the book, Kelly details how she traveled to Italy to source the lace and recreated the look in Britain. The secret behind the gown\u2019s color was Yorkshire tea.\n\nIn Hello! Magazine\u2019s online excerpt from the book, Kelly said, \u201cTogether, we sourced the lace to complement that being made in Italy, and to make sure it looked authentic we dyed it in Yorkshire tea (the strongest, as we all know) \u2026 We placed each piece of lace in a small bowl, from the Dressers\u2019 Kitchen, filled with cool water and a tea bag, and left it for about five minutes, checking regularly until the colour was perfect.\u201d\n\nKelly also shared that she wears the queen\u2019s shoes first before engagements to \u201censure that they are comfortable and that she is always good to go.\u201d\n\nMark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images\n\nIn addition to the secrets behind the fashion, Kelly is also using the book as a way to set the record straight about past reports.\n\nIn 2009, former First Lady Michelle Obama was photographed with her arm around the queen during a G20 reception at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAccording to the magazine, the act prompted global headlines about a supposed breach of protocol at the time.\n\nBut Kelly dispelled the reports and said that the gesture was of \u201caffection and respect for another great woman\u201d and \u201cwhen human instincts kick in, sometimes this is absolutely the appropriate thing to do.\u201d\n\nAnother noteworthy anecdote that Kelly describes in the book is Queen Elizabeth\u2019s appearance alongside James Bond for the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Games.\n\nKelly recalls how she was called to a meeting with director Danny Boyle and Private Secretary Edward Young to discuss the audacious idea in 2011.\n\nKelly wrote, \u201cShe was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked then if she would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: \u2018Of course, I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Queen delivered the iconic line, \u201cGood evening, Mr. Bond.\u201d\n\nHello! Magazine said that Kelly created two identical peach outfits for the project: one for the queen and one for her stuntman, Gary Connery, who famously plunged from a helicopter over the stadium wearing the dress, hat and matching bloomers.\n\nAngela Kelly\u2019s book, \u201cIn The Other Side of The Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and The Wardrobe,\u201d will be released on Tuesday, Oct. 29.", "description": "Queen Elizabeth's right-hand woman and close confidant of 25 years is sharing personal stories and unseen photos in a new book, out on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/queen2-gty-ml-191028_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
