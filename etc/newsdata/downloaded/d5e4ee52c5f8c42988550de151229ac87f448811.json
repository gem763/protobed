I fought alongside soldiers, sailors and Marines on violent battlefields \u2013 and I saw with my own eyes my generation of warriors uphold the proud tradition of America\u2019s patriots.\n\nAmerica\u2019s military has a storied history of bravery, ingenuity and grit. But its most important tradition is the tradition of victory. America\u2019s military wins wars. It is as simple as that.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS AFL-CIO PRESIDENT TRUMKA ON LABOR DAY\n\nIf our nation deems it morally right and existentially necessary, then our military is unstoppable.\n\nOf course, the credit for victory is often given to the members of the military on the front lines \u2013 those taking the fight to our nation\u2019s enemies in close combat. That credit is well deserved. But it is not the only credit that needs to be bestowed.\n\nIt is a simple fact that many of the most critical victories in America\u2019s history were won not only on distant, bloody battlefields, but were also won right here at home: in factories, fields and farms.\n\nIt is this unstoppable work ethic of the American worker that has given our military the tools and technology to maintain our freedom and security in the world. For this, we should all be grateful for the American worker on this Labor Day.\n\nYes, America\u2019s ability to produce \u2013 to design, grow, build and manufacture \u2013 has been just as important to our nation\u2019s victories as our ability to fight.\n\nAnd throughout history, when Americans marched to war, we marched wearing boots made by American hands.\n\nWe wore uniforms that were cut and sewn in American factories.\n\nOur body armor, helmets, and weapons have been the products of the American work ethic, skill and determination.\n\nThe best planes, ships and vehicles in the world that carry us to war and support us on the battlefield only exist because the American worker built them.\n\nWithout the American worker, there can be no American soldier.\n\nSo let us never forget: the freedom we cherish so dearly, is a gift \u2013 not only from our American servicemen and women \u2013 but it is also a gift from the American worker.\n\nThe American worker who toils in fields, in factories, in shipyards and on other job sites.\n\nThe American worker who gets up day after day after day \u2013 not only to build and create products, but also to build our economy.\n\nAnd while our military might is the most prominent sign of the strength of our great nation, it is our economy that gives America our strongest influence around the world and gives us the ability to make the world a better place.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some people today who say that America\u2019s working spirit has been lost; that Americans can no longer build and create; that our skills have been lost and that we can only import products from overseas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThose naysayers are wrong. As a leadership consultant, I work with companies around the country every day and I see with my own eyes the power of American workers. They can still raise crops, build bridges and buildings, create technology, produce energy, manufacture products, and rise to meet any demand that is placed upon them.\n\nI see this on the factory floors of one of the companies I co-own: Origin USA. There, in the foothills of the mountains of western Maine, we have brought back looms to weave fabric and machines to sew boots.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd most importantly, we have brought back the men and women who not only have the skills and knowledge to get the job done, but who also know how to work \u2013 and work hard.\n\nIt is this unstoppable work ethic of the American worker that has given our military the tools and technology to maintain our freedom and security in the world. For this, we should all be grateful for the American worker on this Labor Day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JOCKO WILLINK", "description": "On this Labor Day we should be thankful to our American workers \u2013 not just for what they engineer, build, grow and produce, but also for our freedom.", "authors": ["Jocko Willink"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/MarinesBridge3.jpg"}
