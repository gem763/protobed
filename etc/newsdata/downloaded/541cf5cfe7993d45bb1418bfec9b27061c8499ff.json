[Photo by CHINA DAILY]\n\nThirty years ago, Iranian twins Majid Shamaeizadeh and Massoud Shamaeezadeh began to learn to play traditional Iranian musical instruments and would perform for family members on festive occasions.\n\n\"We were born in Isfahan, which is now considered the cultural and art capital of Iran,\" Shamaeezadeh says.\n\n\"So, among the families of Isfahan, at least one of the family members plays a musical instrument, and the others would know how to sing.\"\n\nThe brothers brought this family tradition with them when they moved to China in 2008.\n\nBoth speak fluent Chinese and are working to enhance cultural exchanges. They've also introduced the art of their homeland to their host country by opening several culture centers.\n\nThe most prominent of these was Persian Paradise - the Iran pavilion at the ninth China International Garden Expo in 2013.\n\nThe brothers, who earned doctorates in design-related disciplines at Peking University in Beijing, designed the pavilion themselves.\n\nShamaeezadeh says their doctoral research featured a cross-cultural comparative approach, which prompted them to engage in cultural exchanges.\n\nDuring their studies, they registered the brand Persian Treasure at the newly founded Yuedu Music Valley zone in Shandong province's Qingdao.\n\n\"Music is a major part of our business scope,\" Shamaeezadeh says. \"So are handicrafts.\"\n\nThe twins also hope to open Chinese culture centers in Iran, he says.\n\nThey are working with the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing on developing dulcimer programs.", "description": "Thirty years ago, Iranian twins Majid Shamaeizadeh and Massoud Shamaeezadeh began to learn to play traditional Iranian musical instruments and would perform for family members on festive occasions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/04/5d96a581a310cf3e979fc268.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
