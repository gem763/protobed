It was something that was very important to us and it has probably freed us up a lot in terms of our relationships.\n\n\u201cEverything that we felt or thought, we just put it out to the group. There were a few bumps in the road but like anything in the world - with your family and things like that - there are always mishaps. It helps to listen to each other and caring about another person's opinion and taking it on board, rather than going back to your room and having a little moan to your mate.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We have got down to it - and it has been good.\u201d\n\nVunipola is one of 16 players in the current squad who experienced the pain of 2015, where back-to-back defeats against Wales and Australia sent them crashing out of their home World Cup earlier than ever before.\n\nAt the time, Vunipola was struggling to hold down a place under Stuart Lancaster, yet under Jones he has developed into arguably the most impactful No 8 currently playing the game. The Saracens back-row believes that the improvement stems from two internal feelings that have scarred him \u2013 not like the one on his left forearm that remains from his injury nightmare in 2017/18 \u2013 that lie deep within his hulking 20-stone frame.\n\n\u201cThat is still vivid in my mind, not something I enjoyed and not something I want to do again,\u201d he added, having been asked if this Saturday\u2019s match against Argentina feels like a switch being flicked ahead of England\u2019s most important pool games.\n\n\u201cWith our destiny in our own hands still, we have to put down a marker, not for anyone else but for ourselves as a team. We have talked a lot about it but talking is different to doing.\n\n\"What drives me a lot is doubt - from people doubting my personal abilities but also doubting the team. That's because I'm in a team environment and what people say about us can either affect you and make you crumble, or helps you to prove everyone wrong. So it's something that I like to use.\n\n\u201cAnd 2015 was massive because we went in with massive expectations on our backs and we didn\u2019t deliver. We've been a bit quieter coming into this tournament and hopefully for us as a group that's a positive thing.\n\n\"We know what the feeling of 2015 is like and we don\u2019t want to feel like that again. We've been hurt before and we don\u2019t want to be like that again. That's driving us on as much as anything else. When 2015 happened everything turned on its head. But as a group, we\u2019ve talked about things that we\u2019ve never been able to put out there and it's brought us closer together.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot more respect in that changing room for each other and it's been really fun.\"\n\nSince missing the best part of 18 months with injury \u2013 Vunipola suffered three broken arms and knee ligament damage in quick succession \u2013 he has developed a more articulate and honest way of projecting his feelings. Of course, as we\u2019ve seen this year during the Israel Folau saga, his words can and have landed him in trouble.\n\nYet this is down to the way that the England squad have learned how to project their feelings, their frustrations and their anger, into ways that make this a better squad: both as a rugby one and as a group of men who don\u2019t always know how to do such a thing in an environment that can frown upon doing so.\n\n\u201cYou know Eddie will always look for things to improve us and that was probably the biggest thing we needed to improve - how together we can be,\u201d said Vunipola. \u201cEvery other team says they are doing it, but being brutally honest can hurt a few feelings.\n\n\u201cBeing within the confines of England rugby, a lot of us are very precious. When you\u2019re at your club, you\u2019re the main man, but when you\u2019re with England you\u2019re just the next person.\n\n\u201cThere were a few handbags thrown around but it was really good. She (Corinne Reid) gave us the platform to do it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard but it is a thing - men don\u2019t know how to talk about their feelings. It took us a while but we got there in the end.\u201d\n\nThe 26-year-old has been selected to start the last 11 England Tests in 2019 by Jones and looks set to make it a straight dozen this weekend against the Pumas, where he could be joined in the squad by older brother Mako, who has not started a match since Saracens\u2019 Champions Cup final victory in May.\n\nAsked about Mako\u2019s frame of mind ahead of his possible return, Billy Vunipola reveals that while the protective barriers may have been knocked down within the squad, there remains obstacles in the way between the Vunipola brothers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly how I just said; we probably communicate via our partners, so you\u2019ll have to ask my wife how he is, because he doesn\u2019t tell me!\u201d laughs Vunipola.\n\n\u201cHis mood is always the same. Whether he\u2019s happy or sad, his face is always the same.\n\n\u201cHe knows he has to fight hard to get back in the team and it was the same for me when I was trying to get back in the team. Mark Wilson did a great job. Everyone has to do the same thing \u2013 Nowellsy [Jack Nowell] is in the same boat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all just fighting and competing, but looking after each other at the same time.\u201d", "description": "Billy Vunipola has revealed how no-holds-barred counselling sessions helped the England\u00a0squad exorcise the demons of their 2015 Rugby World Cup failure, though the talismanic forward admitted he is still fuelled by the desire to never feel that pain of failure again.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/30/10/billy-vunipola.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
