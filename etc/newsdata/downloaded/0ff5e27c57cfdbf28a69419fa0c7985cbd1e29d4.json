The employment tribunal hearing Ahmed\u2019s case was told on Wednesday that BBC bosses eventually halved Vine\u2019s salary in 2018 and wanted to push it lower but feared it would \u201cantagonise him\u201d.\n\nIn her written submission, Ahmed said she put in more hours than her male counterpart, and had a more demanding role which included writing the scripts. Vine\u2019s scripts were written for him.\n\nIn addition, she said: \u201cIt is likely that Jeremy Vine spends less time in make-up than I do.
