'I didn't have this exact role in the team.\n\n'We have lots of offensive players and many other teams try to counterattack you and a lot of the time you're alone but it's good for me.'\n\nCity have often been accused of making deliberate fouls to halt opposition teams in their tracks and Rodri has admitted it is a skill he has acquired under Guardiola.\n\n'I am learning new things, how to go, when to stay, when I have to do a tactical foul, when I have to jump,' he continued.\n\nCity beat Liverpool to win the Community Shield but Rodri says the Reds are best in Europe\n\n'It's good for me to learn these things. And for the team it's good because we need those offensive players to be able to play our game.'\n\nCity have endured a difficult start to the new Premier League season, with Sunday's defeat to Wolves seeing the club fall eight points behind leaders Liverpool.\n\nManchester United have long been City's rivals for the Premier League title but Rodri has acknowledged that Liverpool are now their biggest threat.\n\n'The team to beat is Liverpool now and that has been seen the last two seasons,' he added. 'They are the champions of Europe so everyone wants to beat them, not just us.\n\n'They're a great team, they have improved a lot of things, they're a very good team, and they're the best team in England and in Europe.'", "description": "Manchester City midfielder Rodri has revealed he's learned how to make 'tactical fouls' during his first three months working under Pep Guardiola as he adapts to a holding role in the club's engine room.", "authors": ["Alec Fenn For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/14/19541606-0-image-a-77_1570715234431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
