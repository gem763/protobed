And who doesn't love a cosy night in with the family when it's dark and cold out in the world? We close the curtains, put on the fire, order a takeaway and settle down in front of some seriously good Saturday night TV.\n\nBlogger Nicola Lewis AKA This Girl Can Organise, knows just where we're coming from.\n\n\"I embrace all seasons but I particularly love autumn and winter,\" she says. \"Purely because it\u2019s like a hug. I look forward to coming into my home because of the scene that\u2019s set. The cosy blankets are out, the cosy cushions, candles and mood lighting.\"\n\nAnd if, like Nicola, you want to create the ultimate night in, then Matalan's Winter Ready Homeware collection has everything you need.\n\nSo here's how you can get snug without spending a fortune.\n\nCosy Nights In The Whole Family Looks Forward To\n\nNicola, Francesca and Amelia all wear Mini Me Lounge Set, from \u00a310; Brown Faux Fur Cushion, (now reduced to \u00a38); Faux Fur Throw, (\u00a325); Pom Pom Cushion, (now reduced to \u00a39.60); Knitted Throw, (\u00a345); Rug, (\u00a345); LED Dome, (\u00a312); Artificial Cheese Plant in Pot, (\u00a325) all at Matalan\n\nPerhaps the best thing about autumn and winter is that feeling you get when you snuggle up with the ones you love for a cosy night in.\n\nAnd while everyone has their own version of what it might entail, there are some things which are universal; a sofa, some toasty blankets and throws, a classic movie, popcorn and some comfy pyjamas.\n\nFor Nicola it's also a time to bond with her daughters, Francesca (15) and Amelia (11) after a busy week. \"It\u2019s a time for reflection and we just enjoy our time together,\" she says. \"We\u2019ll be all cosied up and then off to bed. It\u2019s a retreat and something nice to look forward to because it\u2019s not over complicated.\"\n\nBright Leopard Print Lounge Set (\u00a316) and Mini Me Girls Leopard Print Lounge Set (4-13yrs) (\u00a310) at Matalan\n\nAnd she finds that getting the girls into matching PJs makes the experience even more fun.\n\nNicola and older daughter Amelia loved their eye-catching Bright Leopard Print Lounge Sets (above left), while Francesca loved the chance to match in the Mini Me version (above right).\n\n\"They unite us which is quite sweet,\" Nicola says.\n\n\"They bring a bit of fun back to the home, especially with them being teenagers. The girls liked them because they\u2019re cosy and it brought the child out in them. And in me as well.\"\n\nSo why not get your little gang together for cosy nights in they'll all enjoy?\n\nA Living Room To Lounge In\n\nBrown Faux Fur Cushion, (now reduced to \u00a38); Faux Fur Throw, (\u00a325); Pom Pom Cushion, (now reduced to \u00a39.60); Knitted Throw, (\u00a345); Rug, (\u00a345); LED Dome, (\u00a312); Artificial Cheese Plant in Pot, (\u00a325) all at Matalan\n\nThe living room or lounge is the place in our homes we all come together to relax.\n\nIt's where we can finally take it easy at the end of the day, so ensuring it's as welcoming as possible is essential, especially as the temperature starts to drop.\n\n\"I like to create a warm environment so I can switch off,\" agrees Nicola. \"I think it\u2019s really important during this time when the nights draw in and it\u2019s dark. It\u2019s our little hibernation time.\"\n\nAnd Nicola used Matalan's Winter Ready Homeware collection to give her lounge the snug feeling she was looking for.\n\nL-R: Hand Knitted Throw (\u00a345) and Chenille Knit Cushion with Faux Fur Poms (now reduced to \u00a39.60) at Matalan\n\nThe large hand-knitted throw (above left) is ideal for dressing a sofa but will really come into its own on a wintry evening, when it can be pulled over your legs to keep out the cold.\n\nAnd if you're looking to bring in even more comfort and colour then think about adding some cushions to your seating. Matalan's large faux fur cushion (seen on sofa) adds colour and warmth and Nicola loved this cream knitted style (above right) with its adorable playful pom poms. And until Wednesday 9th you can buy both these cosy cushions with a huge 20 per cent off so updating your sitting room will be even more affordable.\n\nAnd a stylish rug can make a real difference to any room, working well on top of floorboards or carpets.\n\n\"This rug (seen in Nicola's living room) was \u00a345 but it looks much more expensive,\" says Nicola. \"It\u2019s so soft, it looks amazing and everyone wants to sit on it on the floor which is nice. It\u2019s a really cosy feature.\"\n\nIt's all in the details\n\nLED Wooden Star, (\u00a312); Flowers In Vase, (\u00a37); Stag Tea Light Holder, (\u00a315); Pyramid Lantern, (\u00a310) all at Matalan\n\nA communal living room is the perfect place to display your favourite pictures and ornaments and as we move into winter, how we use lighting becomes even more important.\n\n\"We all lead really busy lives and to come home and switch off our mindset and switch off the lights is a good feeling,\" says Nicola. \"Just looking at twinkling lights, that\u2019s what appeals to us at Christmas, but you can have it all year round. So having this LED star and some lights in lanterns, give warmth to a room.\"", "description": "October is here and autumn is well and truly underway.
