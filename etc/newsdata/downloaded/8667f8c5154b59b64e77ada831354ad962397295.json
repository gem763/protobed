top medical chief warns of deaths after no-deal Brexit", "language": "en", "text": "Professor Dame Sally Davies has warned of deaths in the event of no-deal Brexit (Picture: Getty)\n\nPeople could die as a result of a no-deal Brexit, England\u2019s Chief Medical Officer has said.\n\nAs the clock ticks on the October 31 deadline and hopes of a deal branded \u2018extremely unlikely\u2019, Professor Dame Sally Davies made her worrying prediction.\n\nShe said there would be shortages of medical supplies because of import problems caused by crashing out without a divorce deal.\n\nDame Sally told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u2018The health service and everyone has worked very hard to prepare.\n\n\u2018But I say what I\u2019ve said before, that we cannot guarantee that there will not be shortages not only in medicines but technology and gadgets and things.\n\n\u2018And there may be deaths, we can\u2019t guarantee there won\u2019t.\u2019\n\nPressed if lives are at risk, she firmly replied: \u2018They are at risk.\u2019\n\nProfessor Dame Sally Davies speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe NHS has repeatedly warned of a crisis in both staffing and access to medicines once we leave the EU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOperation Yellowhammer, the leaked government document outlining the impact of no-deal Brexit, found that the supply chains for medicines and products were \u2018particularly vulnerable\u2019 to disruption at the Channel ports.\n\nIt noted that the chaos could last up to six months.\n\nWhile some medicinal products can be stockpiled, those with a short shelf-life cannot.\n\nThese include drugs such as insulin to treat diabetes and medicines used by children suffering from cancer.\n\nBritain imports about 37 million medicine packs every month from the EU, industry figures have shown.\n\nThree-quarters of medicines come via the main Channel crossings into Dover and Folkestone.\n\nThose that need to be transported under temperature-controlled conditions are at risk if there are the predicted lengthy delays at the ports.\n\nSome vaccines at risk are those to combat flu and as winter approaches, the UK is about to head into \u2018flu season.\u2019\n\nA large number of staff in the NHS are from the EU (Picture: Getty)\n\nLast week, NHS Wales unveiled a so-called \u2018Brexit Warehouse\u2019 to store around 1,000 extra products including medical gloves, needles and dressings at a cost of about \u00a35 million.\n\nThe discredited boast by Brexiteers that leaving the EU would save the NHS \u00a3350 million a week was one main reason people voted to exit the bloc.\n\nIn reality, more than 62,000 NHS staff in England are EU nationals, accounting for 5.6% of staff.\n\nThere are concerns over both recruiting and retaining staff once freedom of movement ends.\n\nThe NHS is already short of over 100,000 personnel including 43,000 nurses.\n\nScientists have warned the UK will soon not have access to ground-breaking pharmaceuticals and overseas medical research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, a Twitter campaign was launched using the hashtag \u2018death by Brexit.\u2019\n\nOperation Yellowhammer warned of delays to trucks carrying vital medical supplies (Picture: AFP)\n\nPeople who rely on EU medicines to survive put a black dot on their Twitter handle to show the government that lives are at risk.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has declared that he can \u2018confidently\u2019 say the UK is prepared to leave the EU without a deal at the end of this month.\n\nOn the issue of health, a Government report said: \u2018The UK will continue to play a world-leading role in health security, patient safety and medical advance after Brexit.\n\n\u2018Opportunities may include innovative regulation of novel advanced therapies and medicines, and a streamlined approach to clinical trial reporting and conduct.\n\n\u2018These strengths in health research will be further supported by fast-track visas for world-leading scientists.\u2019\n\nThe report outlines plans to set up a dedicated support unit for suppliers of medical goods in the health sector.\n\nIt says the aim is to ensure that companies have the necessary customs paperwork in place for border arrangements ahead of a no-deal scenario.\n\nIt says suppliers of all medicines and medical products should ensure they are ready to comply with the new customs and border processes required to import and export goods between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe report also says adult social care providers should plan for longer lead times of up to five days for products imported from the EU, and be prepared to receive stock deliveries outside normal hours.", "description":
