Kardashian's 2019 Met Gala attire, however, put the socialite in a rather precarious position that required some intense preparation.\n\nAt the Met Gala, Kardashian donned a silicone Mugler dress that required extra preparation in case of any bodily mishaps. Although she successfully pulled off the look, she had to set a contingency plan in place for potential bathroom breaks.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN ADMITS SHE WAS \u2018EMBARRASSINGLY OBSESSED\u2019 WITH FAME, ISN\u2019T BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY STUDYING LAW\n\nBeneath the dress, Kardashian sported a custom waist-cinching corset and knee-length shapewear, which only added to the stress the outfit put on her body. Knowing that there was no escape from the dress the entire night, Kardashian spoke about the risk of not being able to use the bathroom throughout the night.\n\n\u201cIf I got to pee, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d Kardashian told her cohorts, as seen in the \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d clip above.\n\nKYLIE JENNER DENIES '2AM DATE' WITH EX TYGA: 'THE INTERNET MAKES EVERYTHING 100 TIMES MORE DRAMATIC '\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an emergency, I think I\u2019d pee my pants and then have my sister wipe my leg up,\u201d Kardashian stated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even joking. She can wipe my leg up,\" she continued without remorse, much to the shock of everyone in the room.\n\nKardashian further elaborated on how uncomfortable --even painful --her form-fitting dress was, noting the material used had an adverse effect on her body.\n\n\u201cNot only is this silicone, 500 hours of beading and making, but every little piece is itchy on the inside. It\u2019s pokey, so it pokes me,\u201d Kardashian lamented. \u201cIt\u2019s a cactus.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the event, Kardashian and husband Kanye West appeared together \u2014 but Kim made it clear how she wanted to be photographed on the red carpet. \u201cKanye can come in and take some [photos] with me, but I definitely [want] solos,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe first year he was holding my hand and I was wearing a floral glove and they just cropped me out.\u201d", "description": "Kim Kardashian is no stranger to provocative clothing.
