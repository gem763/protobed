Tusk also praised the country for finding a solution to its long-running name dispute with Greece, by agreeing to be called North Macedonia.\n\nFor years, the country had been known internationally as FYROM, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\n\nGiven heightened tensions among eastern and western EU countries, particularly over issues like migration and rule-of-law, there has been minimal appetite among many EU leaders for further expanding the bloc. But Bulgaria used its presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2018 to push hard to bring the Western Balkans back onto the agenda in Brussels, particularly with an eye toward reviving membership hopes \u2014 particularly for North Macedonia and Albania.\n\n\"When the EU leaders met in June, three months ago, they committed to deliver a 'clear and substantive' decision \u2013 in October \u2013 on whether to open accession talks with you and your neighbor, Albania,\" Tusk said in a joint appearance with Zaev. \"I expressed my personal views clearly back in June: your country, within the last two years, has done everything that was expected of you for the EU to be able to launch the negotiations in line with the European Commission's recommendation. That continues to be my strong conviction. Your country has done everything.\"\n\nTusk, who will complete his second and final term as Council president at the end of November, said he wanted his visit to North Macedonia to showcase his support.\n\n\"That is also why I came to North Macedonia today,\" he told Zaev. \"I wish to make it crystal clear: there is no doubt in Brussels about your political commitment to the rule of law and to fighting corruption. Of course, anybody can at anytime and anywhere do more, especially when it comes to implementation. But we know very well that your government is determined and consistent in this, also as regards the continuation of the work of the Special Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\"\n\nGiven the heavy focus in Brussels on the U.K.'s tortured effort to leave the EU, the visit to North Macedonia gave Tusk a chance to recall that there are still countries eager to join the European Union. But he also urged patience and forbearance.\n\n\"Allow me one metaphor,\" Tusk said. \"The EU accession process resembles a marathon more than a 100-meters sprint. And as a dedicated runner, I know what I am talking about. To reach the finish line, continued strength, endurance and focus is needed. And sometimes, I should also say, patience. I have no doubt that North Macedonia possesses more than enough of all these qualities. And everyone should appreciate it.\"\n\nHe ended by imploring EU heads of state and government to back his position.\n\n\"Skopje is the best possible place where I would like to appeal to the leaders of the European Union: Now you do your share,\" Tusk said. \"Because North Macedonia has already done its share. \"", "description": "Visiting Skopje, Council president says Balkan nation can win accession \u2018marathon.\u2019", "authors": ["David M.
