Balloons. Pigeons. Drones. Alcohol. The list of things that have been banned in the run up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of China keeps growing.\n\nAs Beijing seeks to ensure the special day on 1 October goes off without a hint of a hitch, motorists have been told they must not refuel their cars or motorbikes on their own. There must be no use of walkie-talkies and other devices using radio waves. During rehearsals for a military parade to mark the day, those living near Tiananmen Square have been instructed \u201cnot to approach the windows\u201d and to keep their curtains closed. In neighbouring Shanxi province, police and other public security staff have been forbidden from drinking spirits since 15 September.\n\nThe crackdown is fiercest among those who criticise the government. Normally outspoken activists and critics have been ordered not to speak to foreign media. Some, who have expressed support for the Hong Kong protests, have had to promise they won\u2019t travel to the city until well after the anniversary on 1 October.\n\nThe popular microblog Weibo has also launched a \u201cspecial clean-up operation\u201d against \u201charmful political information\u201d and any accounts or posts that \u201cdistort the history of the party and the country,\u201d according to a statement issued earlier this month.\n\nChaos, hope, change: stories from 70 years of the People's Republic of China Read more\n\nThe tightening of control in the run up to the celebrations comes as Beijing is facing what is arguably its most difficult chapter since 1989, when the military killed thousands pro-democracy protesters, plunging the country into international isolation.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s commemoration comes at a time when Xi and the Chinese communist party are facing an extraordinary set of challenges at home and abroad,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\u201cFrom unrest in Hong Kong and its impact on the upcoming Taiwan elections, its the extraordinary crackdown on Uighurs in western China and a slowing economy, and of course the rapid deterioration in US-China relations, the coming year will arguably be the most challenging for Beijing since 1989,\u201d he said.\n\nThe extreme measures the government has gone to make sure the event goes smoothly betrays some of that insecurity because for Beijing, the 70th anniversary is more than just another national day. It is also a marker of survival: the PRC has now lasted longer than the Soviet Union and it is cementing its role as a global power.\n\n\u201cThis is another milestone, another moment to show that the CCP has remained against all odds and all predictions,\u201d said Maura Cunningham, a historian who specialises in modern China. \u201cThis is a time the party can demonstrate order and control, and might,\u201d she said.\n\nFree TVs and bright red flags\n\nThe holiday is as much about impressing Chinese citizens as it is about projecting Chinese strength abroad. The milestone will be marked with a massive military parade, fireworks and a speech by president Xi Jinping. Some 100,000 people \u201cfrom all walks of life\u201d will be attending the event, according to state media. To ensure those not invited still watch, authorities have given out 620,000 television sets.\n\nBright red flags have been newly hung in apartment compounds and neighbourhoods. Giant topiaries in honour of the 70th anniversary decorate Beijing\u2019s roads. Banners across overpasses read: \u201cToday\u2019s China is the result of the work of Chinese people.\u201d\n\nBut the spectre of unrest in Hong Kong \u2013 much of it aimed at Beijing\u2019s rule over the semi-autonomous territory \u2013looms large over the celebrations. Protesters are calling for mass demonstrations in the days leading up to the holiday as well as on 1 Oct. Already, Hong Kong has cancelled fireworks and has planned a \u201cmodest but solemn\u201d celebration in light of likely disruptions.\n\n\u201cHong Kong has become a battleground for demonstrating to the world that Chinese people if given the chance do not want to live under the kind of communist rule that Xi Jinping advertises every day to the world. Oct 1 will show that difference,\u201d said Jerome Cohen, a China law expert and professor at New York University. \u201cFor him, it may be the most difficult problem he has encountered.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Visitors hold the Chinese national flag after a group photo before attending an exhibition marking China\u2019s achievements over 70 years Photograph: How Hwee Young/EPA\n\n\u2018The party is on the back foot\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s challenges may be more obvious to outsiders than to its own citizens. Over the last year, officials have portrayed the country as strong enough to weather the trade war and right a slowing Chinese economy.\n\nYet even as the party remains firmly in control within the country, there are pockets of dissent, ranging from support for the protesters in Hong Kong to veiled criticism from intellectuals or even from those within the party.\n\nIn recent weeks, a crackdown on virtual private networks, used to get around China\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall\u201d and access banned foreign websites has become so severe that the editor of China\u2019s state-run tabloid known for its nationalist views, criticised the censorship.\n\n\u201cNational Day is approaching and it\u2019s extremely difficult to access the web,\u201d Hu Xijin wrote on Weibo, describing such measures as a \u201cbit over the top\u201d given that \u201cthe overwhelming majority of our people are patriotic and love the party with strong political conviction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis country is not fragile. I suggest society have more access to the outside internet, which will benefit the strength and maturity of China\u2019s public opinion, scientific research, external communications, and China\u2019s national interests,\u201d Hu said in a post that has since been deleted.\n\nIn a recent article tracing the development of the CCP over the last seven decades, Wang Changjiang, a professor at the Central Party School wrote of the need for \u201cintra-party democracy,\u201d a term to describe checks and balances within the CCP, which for decades has operated under a system of collective leadership and competition between factions.\n\nExperts believe Xi, who once pledged to expand such checks, has eroded that system of collective leadership by taking down rivals and changing the constitution to allow himself to stay in power indefinitely.\n\n\u201cIntra-party democracy is not only a problem that must be solved for the sustainable development of the Communist Party itself, but also a problem that needs to be answered urgently for maintaining power in a sound way,\u201d Wang wrote.\n\nUnder Xi, Beijing has adopted a more assertive position on the international stage, promoting initiatives like One Belt One Road. Some believe that has provoked backlash, prompting other countries to move from engaging China to attempting to contain the country.\n\n\u201cThe party is on the back foot and while Xi now has an open path to lifetime leadership, that leadership looks very insecure,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cBy making himself number one, he makes himself the number one target for everything that goes wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nIn some ways, Xi appears to be taking a more defensive position. In a speech earlier this month, he told cadres at the Communist Party school in Beijing: \u201cWe must pay attention\u2026 to the art of battle. We must grasp contradictions, understand their aspects, and rationally choose our method of battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn matters of principle, not an inch will be yielded\u2026 but on matters of tactics there can be flexibility,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang", "description": "As Beijing prepares to mark founding of PRC with a massive military parade, the Chinese leadership faces its most difficult chapter since 1989", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0164f48dea926b6fec54a29735ee893696a4122d/0_39_3168_1900/master/3168.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0d671c37098b9be62d4fcb6ea91d5446", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
