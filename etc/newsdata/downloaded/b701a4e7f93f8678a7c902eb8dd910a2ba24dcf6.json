The government has already asked for an extension to the end of January 2020, and European Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter he will recommend that request is granted.\n\nSome believe a general election could be on the cards, given that Johnson had such slim support for his deal. In the event of a Johnson victory, he can likely implement his Brexit plan without too much trouble, but an opposition victory could open the door to a second referendum on EU membership, said analysts at Danske Bank in a note to clients.\n\n\u201cRegardless, it is difficult to see a path to a no-deal outcome anymore, which also explains why a lot of negativity has been priced out of the GBP,\u201d said the analysts.\n\nThe pound GBPUSD, -0.1010%, which tumbled Tuesday after the timetable vote, slipped further to $1.2864, versus $1.2873 seen in late North American trade the same day.
