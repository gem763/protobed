REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nEuropean stocks fizzled after euro zone manufacturing data showed the sharpest contraction in almost seven years. U.S. stocks and the dollar dropped sharply on data showing manufacturing contracted to a 10-year low in September, adding to fears of a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy as a result of the trade war with China.\n\n\u201cThe PMIs across the globe have continued to deteriorate and obviously we are in line with that deterioration. It\u2019s all due to the trade war,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 343.79 points, or 1.28%, to 26,573.04, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 36.49 points, or 1.23%, to 2,940.25 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 90.65 points, or 1.13%, to 7,908.69. Each index had posted modest gains in early morning trading.\n\nMSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.83%.\n\nA slowdown in U.S. economic growth at a time when Europe is seen as close to falling into a recession would remove one of the few bright spots among global markets.\n\n\u201cIf we look at some of the data out of either Asia Pacific or the European zone, the U.S. economic data has certainly been the stand-out across the board,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York.\n\nU.S. stocks initially gained after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro dismissed reports on Monday that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nChina and the United States are to resume trade talks next week in Washington.\n\n\u201cWhether it was a \u2018fake news\u2019 or not, it is becoming harder to know exactly what the U.S. administration will be doing,\u201d said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex Securities.\n\nConcerns over the economy helped send investors into the perceived safety of bonds. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 10/32 in price to yield 1.6404%, from 1.673% late on Monday.\n\nBritish government bonds had sold off as Prime Minister Boris Johnson pitched new proposals for an amended Brexit agreement that would remove the contested insurance policy for the Irish border.\n\n\u201cWe had reached extreme lows (for bond yields) in August, but now the central banks have delivered the easing markets were expecting, I think we needed this correction,\u201d said Pooja Kumra, a European rates strategist at TD Securities.\n\nThe World Trade Organization cut its forecast for growth in global trade this year by more than half on Tuesday and said further rounds of tariffs and retaliation, a slowing economy and a disorderly Brexit could squeeze it even more.\n\nOil prices slipped after the weak U.S. data was released, with U.S. crude CLcv1 down 0.5% to $58.90 a barrel and Brent LCOc1 down 0.9% to $53.56.", "description": "Weak economic data in the United States and Europe weighed on global stock benchmarks on Tuesday, sending investors into safe-haven assets.", "authors": ["David Randall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435920989&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9030B", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
