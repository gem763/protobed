The latest YouGov survey puts the Labour Party on 18 per cent, in fourth place behind the Conservatives, the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe latest Ipsos Mori poll, meanwhile, gives Mr Corbyn the worst rating of any leader of the opposition since the series began in 1977, with 17 per cent satisfied with the way he is doing his job as leader of the opposition, and 75 per cent dissatisfied.\n\nThe Labour leader is doing something wrong. With the right of centre deeply divided between a leaderless Conservative Party and the insurgent Brexit Party, this ought to be a moment of great opportunity for a party of social justice and international cooperation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMr Corbyn\u2019s ambiguous policy on Europe may not be the only cause of Labour\u2019s woes, but it is a large part of it, not least because it has allowed the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party to capture a large part of Labour\u2019s potential support.\n\nThe Labour leader\u2019s refusal to get off the Brexit fence prompted public expressions of frustration from his own shadow cabinet last week. Last weekend the real cause of Mr Corbyn\u2019s reluctance took to Andrew Marr\u2019s sofa to explain that he is in favour of leaving the European Union.\n\nLen McCluskey, the leader of Unite, Labour\u2019s largest affiliate, said: \u201cThe Theresa May deal, if it encompassed a customs union, customs arrangements, which are so important in terms of investment for our nation, then that is the type of deal that I\u2019d be comfortable to see go through.\u201d\n\nHe said he was opposed to a no-deal Brexit but, if forced to choose between a customs union deal and staying in the EU, he would prefer to leave the EU.\n\nMr McCluskey\u2019s position is at odds not just with that of most Labour members, including Labour MPs and shadow cabinet ministers, but with the views of his own members \u2013 65 per cent of whom want to remain in the EU, according to another YouGov survey.\n\nMr Corbyn has indulged his ally\u2019s stubbornness for too long. Facing both ways on Brexit is now threatening the Labour Party\u2019s very survival as a credible electoral force.\n\nMr McCluskey claims, as leader of a union that campaigned for Remain in the 2016 referendum, to be a defender of democracy. But democracy is not a single event. One democratic decision can be amended by another. The decision of the 2016 referendum could not be implemented, because its advocates could not agree what it meant.\n\nMeanwhile, another finding of the YouGov poll is relevant. It asked: \u201cIn hindsight, do you think Britain was right or wrong to vote to leave the EU?\u201d Excluding don\u2019t knows, 46 per cent said \u201cright\u201d and 56 per cent said \u201cwrong\u201d.\n\nThus Mr Corbyn needs to trump Mr McCluskey\u2019s claim to be a democrat by advocating a fresh referendum, to give the people the final say on whether they want to leave the EU, and if so on what terms.\n\nThe Labour Party, and Mr Corbyn\u2019s leadership, will not survive unless he backs a Final Say referendum in which the party campaigns to keep the best deal with the EU: membership.", "description": "The message of the opinion polls for Jeremy Corbyn could not be clearer.
