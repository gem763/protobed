Yet a rerun of the conservative-nationalist alliance with Kurz\u2019s party is still on the cards.\n\nThe main argument against a fresh pact between the \u00d6VP and the FP\u00d6, wrote the liberal newspaper Der Standard, was less \u201cmoral qualms\u201d on Kurz\u2019s part than fear of reputation damage. It said: \u201cIn spite of the proliferation of rightwing populist trends, the party of [ex-leaders J\u00f6rg] Haider and Strache is a global symbol of democratic misfits \u2013 after Ibiza more than ever.\u201d\n\nMany commentators believe a link-up with the nationalist right remains Kurz\u2019s personal preference, however. \u201cThe Freedom party is much more dangerous in opposition, and Kurz knows he can work with them without much of a hit to his popularity ratings,\u201d said Reinhard Heinisch, a political scientist at Salzburg University.\n\n\u201cI would put the chances of Kurz entering a new pact with the Freedom party at 60:40,\u201d Heinisch told the Guardian. \u201cBut the chances of such a coalition lasting are pretty low,\u201d he added. Each of the four cabinets the far-right party has helped form in the postwar period has collapsed before the end of a full term.\n\nA \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with the centre-left Social Democrats (SP\u00d6), which lies second in the polls, would produce a more stable government and has been the norm for much of the postwar period. But many Austrians associate a centrist alliance with political stasis and infighting.\n\nInstead, Kurz could be tempted to forge a three-way coalition with the Green party and the liberal NEOS, whose leader is a former member of the \u00d6VP.\n\nNicknamed the \u201cdirndl coalition\u201d, an unorthodox alliance of this kind has governed the regional parliament of Salzburg since June last year, and has relatively high approval ratings: according to a recent survey by the pollster Public Opinion Strategies, 29% of Austrians said they would like to see Kurz\u2019s party team up with the Greens and NEOS.", "description": "Ex-chancellor was ousted four months ago after corruption scandal hit coalition partners", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8e562478fc10ee1667fa1c20f60804042ffd638/693_579_4346_2608/master/4346.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3dc4cecf5bfda702c4a04b16fa638e2e", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
