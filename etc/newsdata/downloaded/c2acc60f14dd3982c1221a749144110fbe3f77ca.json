The certification from the FAA additionally allows UPS to use drones that weigh more than 55 pounds with their cargo attached.\n\n\u201cNow, we are actually moving forward into a sustainable operating model,\u201d Ganesh said. \u201cWe have no limits on the number of aircraft, the number of operators or the number of locations. So basically we have been cut loose to actually scale throughout the country.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the FAA granted a similar, but more limited, certification to Alphabet subsidiary Wing. Amazon Prime Air recently applied for an FAA exemption so it could make commercial drone deliveries.\n\nEven with this certification, UPS needs an OK from the FAA before it flies a drone beyond visual line of sight, Ganesh noted. The FAA allowed it to do so for its first post-approval flight, making it the first \u201cregular revenue-generating delivery\u201d past the line of sight of the operator in the country. UPS has conducted a total of about 1,000 flights, for charge, at the Raleigh campus.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bb/0b/ea21262f4dedb30a71b418810435/191001-ups-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
