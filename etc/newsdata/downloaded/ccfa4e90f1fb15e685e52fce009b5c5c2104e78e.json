Giuliani says he'd only cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry if his client agreed. Central to the investigation is the effort by Giuliani to have Ukraine conduct a corruption probe into Joe Biden and his son's dealings with a Ukrainian energy company. Trump echoed that request in a July 2019 call with Ukraine's president. The House Intelligence Committee is leading the inquiry, and Chairman Adam Schiff hasn't decided if he wants to hear from Giuliani. AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The president's lawyer insists the real story is a debunked conspiracy theory. A senior White House adviser blames the \"deep state.\" And a Republican congressman is pointing at Joe Biden's son.\n\nAs the Democrats drive an impeachment inquiry toward a potential vote by the end of the year, President Donald Trump's allies are struggling over how he should manage the starkest threat to his presidency. The jockeying broke into the open Sunday on the talk show circuit, with a parade of Republicans erupting into a surge of second-guessing.\n\nAt the top of the list: Rudy Giuliani's false charge that it was Ukraine that meddled in the 2016 elections. The former New York mayor has been encouraging Ukraine to investigate both Biden and Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the president. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again,\" said Tom Bossert, Trump's former homeland security adviser. \"That conspiracy theory has got to go, they have to stop with that, it cannot continue to be repeated.\"\n\nNot only did Giuliani repeat it Sunday, he brandished pieces of paper he said were affidavits supporting his story.\n\n\"Tom Bossert doesn't know what's he's talking about,\" Guiliani said. He added that Trump was framed by the Democrats.\n\nSenior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, meanwhile, noted that he's worked in the federal government \"for nearly three years.\"\n\n\"I know the difference between whistleblower and a deep state operative,\" Miller said. \"This is a deep state operative, pure and simple.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, heatedly said Trump was merely asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to root out corruption. That, Jordan said, includes Hunter Biden's membership on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.\n\nMixed messaging reflects the difficulty Republicans are having defending the president against documents released by the White House that feature Trump's own words and actions. A partial transcript and a whistleblower complaint form the heart of the House impeachment inquiry and describe Trump pressuring a foreign president to investigate Biden's family.\n\nIn a series of tweets Sunday night, Trump said he deserved to meet \"my accuser\" as well as whoever provided the whistleblower with what the president called \"largely incorrect\" information. He also accused Democrats of \"doing great harm to our Country\" in an effort to destabilize the nation and the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has insisted the call was \"perfect\" and pushed to release both documents.\n\n\"He didn't even know that it was wrong,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, describing a phone call from Trump in which the president suggested the documents would exonerate him.\n\nBut Democrats seized on them as evidence that Trump committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" by asking for a foreign leader's help undermining a political rival, Democrat Joe Biden. Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry and on Sunday told other Democrats that public sentiment had swung behind the probe.\n\nBy all accounts, the Democratic impeachment effort was speeding ahead with a fair amount of coordination between Pelosi, Democratic messaging experts and its political operation.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday that he expects the whistleblower to testify \"very soon,\" though details were still being worked out and no date had been set. Hearings and depositions were starting this week. Many Democrats are pushing for a vote on articles of impeachment before the end of the year, mindful of the looming 2020 elections.\n\nSchiff said in one interview that his committee intends to subpoena Giuliani for documents and may eventually want to hear from Giuliani directly. In a separate TV appearance, Giuliani said he would not cooperate with Schiff, but then acknowledged he would do what Trump tells him. The White House did not provide an official response on whether the president would allow Giuliani to cooperate.\n\nLawyers for the whistleblower expressed concern about that individual's safety, noting that some have offered a $50,000 \"bounty\" for the whistleblower's identity. They said they expect the situation to become even more dangerous for their client and any other whistleblowers, as Congress seeks to investigate this matter.", "description": "The president's lawyer insists the real story is a debunked conspiracy theory.
