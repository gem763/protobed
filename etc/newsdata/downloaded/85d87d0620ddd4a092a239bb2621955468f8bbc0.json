Supporters believed he may face charges for his calls to overthrow the government.\n\nGabyshev\u2019s march across the country became a viral online curiosity as anger over flawed elections triggered the largest protests in Russia\u2019s capital for years. The arrest of his driver in the city of Ulan-Ude helped spark a demonstration by hundreds of people there, and hundreds more came to hear him speak in the city of Chita.\n\nIn his six months on the road, Gabyshev was shadowed by reporters and waylaid by an opposing group of shamans, who demanded he tone down his political messages. Shamans are members of religious and cultural communities, which are widespread in Siberia, who are perceived to have access to other levels of spiritual consciousness.\n\n\u201cGod has told me to do this, nature has told me to do this,\u201d Gabyshev said in an early interview, announcing his desire to perform an exorcism on Putin. \u201cAfter that, Russia will be free.\u201d\n\nA tight-knit group of advisers and protectors formed around Gabyshev during the journey, bolstering speculation that he had created something of a cult. One former supporter in a salacious interview with the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper said some donations had been spent on Gabyshev\u2019s family and \u201cpornographic games\u201d.\n\nGabyshev\u2019s journey appeared to come to an end on Thursday when law enforcement officers stormed his tent camp on the M-53 highway.\n\nViktor Yegorov, a supporter of Gabyshev, said several dozen police officers carrying automatic rifles went straight to Gabyshev\u2019s tent and threw him on the ground. \u201cThis is how terrorists, criminals and people dangerous to the government are captured,\u201d said Yegorov in a video. \u201cThis is how they capture bandits.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear what laws the shaman has broken. A terse statement by police from Yakutia said a man fitting Gabyshev\u2019s description had been wanted for \u201ca crime committed on the territory of the Sakha Republic\u201d, the official name for the Yakutia region.\n\nAmnesty International called for Gabyshev\u2019s release and described the arrest as a \u201cbrutal suppression of human rights\u201d that violated his right to religious freedom.\n\n\u201cThe shaman\u2019s actions may be eccentric, but the Russian authorities\u2019 response is grotesque. Are they truly afraid of his magical powers?\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s Russia director, Natalia Zviagina, said. \u201cAleksandr Gabyshev should be free to express his political views and exercise his religion just like anyone else.\u201d", "description": "Alexander Gabyshev walked 1,700 miles across Russia before being held by police", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6fc9464e6421b72e5c4f21e66a333a4822b69e1/14_6_954_573/master/954.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b8e5d4508c550afb3a8c596779bbf730", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
