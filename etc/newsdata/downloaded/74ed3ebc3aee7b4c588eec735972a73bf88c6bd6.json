Registered users can also propose new observation requirements.\n\nThe satellite continuously monitored a gigantic iceberg breaking away from the Amery Ice Shelf in east Antarctica in September, helping limit its impact on submerged buoys and investigation ships in the surrounding area.\n\nCheng said the satellite will help reduce China's reliance on foreign satellites for polar observation data.\n\n\"The satellite's spatial resolution reaches 75 meters, which offers more detailed information on the ice cover and the sea ice,\" Cheng said.\n\nThe satellite will also support China's upcoming 36th Antarctic expedition by enhancing its navigation capability in the polar ice zone.\n\nDeveloped by the Beijing Normal University and Shenzhen Aerospace Dongfanghong Development Ltd, the satellite weighs 16 kg and is equipped with two cameras and one receiver. It has great significance in promoting the research of polar regions and global climate change.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9dd9dfa310cf3e97a057f6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
