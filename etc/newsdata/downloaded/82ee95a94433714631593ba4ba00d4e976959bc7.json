But in the midst of his anger, he suggested it was because she was a \u2018woman\u2019.\n\nThe former I\u2019m A Celebrity star was set-up by his wife into thinking she had accidentally transferred an eye-watering \u00a32 million into the account of his friend Sam who, unbeknownst to Amir, was also in on the prank.\n\nFaryal, 28, had hidden cameras around their kitchen to catch the moment Amir was fooled into thinking \u00a32 million of his tax-free money was gone forever.\n\nGrowing increasingly furious with his wife, Amir shouted: \u2018From \u00a320 you were supposed to put in, to \u00a32million?\n\n\u2018What the f*** do you do all day?\u2019\n\nAt one point, he then remarked to Sam on the phone when explaining what happened: \u2018Bro, this is what I mean, women,\u2019 suggesting that Faryal made the mistake simply because of her gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reality of the (fake) situation then dawned on Amir, 32, who admitted that legally Sam wouldn\u2019t be obligated to return the money.\n\n\u2018How do we get him to send it back?\u2019 he wondered desperately. \u2018Legally, that\u2019s it. We can\u2019t chase him back for that money.\n\n\u2018From \u00a320 to \u00a32million you dumb f**k. What is wrong with you Faryal? What the f***\u2019s wrong with your head?\u2019\n\nAmir was unaware there were secret cameras all over the house (Picture: YouTube, Faryal Makhdoom)\n\nAmir and Faryal are expecting their third child (Picture: WENN.com)\n\nFaryal eventually put the boxer out of his misery by confessing the whole thing was a prank and asked her flustered husband: \u2018There\u2019s a camera there, there\u2019s a camera there\u2026 Do you really think I\u2019d give away \u00a32m!\u2019\n\nAfter taking some time to cool down, Amir shared a link to the YouTube video on his Instagram account and said: \u2018I\u2019m usually a very calm person. But @faryalmakhdoom got me BAD this time!! Check out the full video on her YouTube channel.\n\n\u2018What would your reaction be if 2 million went missing!!!?\u2019\n\nFaryal certainly wouldn\u2019t need the stress of losing \u00a32 million either as she\u2019s currently pregnant with their third child.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
