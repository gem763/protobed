He was stripped by the presidency of that responsibility in July and resigned from the government days later.\n\nEarlier in September, his lawyers said he had been questioned by police about his role managing the Ebola response. They denied any wrongdoing by Ilunga.\n\nIn a statement, the national police said Ilunga was detained because they believed he planned to evade legal proceedings by leaving the country.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, police received information about his disappearance with a view to reaching Congo-Brazzaville,\u201d the police\u2019s press service said, referring to neighbouring Congo Republic.\n\nIt said Ilunga was in police custody and would come before a prosecutor on Sept. 16.\n\nIlunga\u2019s lawyers denied he had planned to flee the country. \u201cHe strongly reaffirms his innocence in this case and vows to defend himself,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nForeign donors have provided more than $150 million in funding to the Ebola response over the past year, but the United Nations has said hundreds of millions of dollars more are needed.\n\nThe outbreak has so far killed over 2,000 people and infected 1,000 more. Only the 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa, which killed more than 11,300, was deadlier.", "description": "A former Congolese health minister was taken into custody on Saturday over alleged mismanagement of funds for the country's response to the Ebola epidemic, police said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
