Its former partner, the Five Star Movement (M5S), then went into coalition with the centre-left Democratic party (PD).\n\nDonatella Tesei of the League was elected president of Umbria after capturing 57% of the vote on Sunday, backed by the smaller far-right party Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia.\n\nThe result means the M5S and PD alliance has stumbled in its first electoral test, with the joint candidate, Vincenzo Bianconi, who was also backed by other leftwing and green groups, taking 37% of the vote.\n\nElections in Umbria, a hilly region with a population of about 900,000, were brought forward by a year after Catiuscia Marini of the PD was forced to resign as president in April amid an investigation into the manipulation of entrance exams for staff at a hospital in Perugia.\n\nSalvini\u2019s coalition campaigned heavily as it seized on the scandal as well as the PD\u2019s neglect of areas of the region that were affected by earthquakes in 2016.\n\nBut as the trio celebrated what Salvini hailed \u201ca historical feat\u201d, the mood in the hilltop town of Orvieto was despondent on Monday morning, with voters saying they had been faced with \u201ca choice between thieves and haters\u201d.\n\nOrvieto, for years a communist stronghold, had already been divided after the Salvini coalition\u2019s candidate, Roberta Tardani, won mayoral elections in May. One of her first moves was to ban African immigrants from begging for money on the streets, with a Nigerian man arrested and prohibited from returning to the town for three years.\n\nSalvini has visited Orvieto three times since Tardani\u2019s election, joking that he would like to move there.\n\nMuch of the Salvini coalition\u2019s campaigning in Umbria contained the usual mix of anti-immigrant, anti-gay rhetoric and religious symbolism. Giorgia Meloni, the leader of Brothers of Italy, took a selfie outside Orvieto\u2019s gothic cathedral on Friday and posted it on social media alongside the message: \u201cSomeone will be shocked, but I repeat: we will continue to defend God, the homeland and the family. Also in Umbria\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was no surprise that they won,\u201d said Elisabetta Spallaccia, a shop owner in Orvieto. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a leftwing voter and while I voted for the PD I was very sceptical about supporting them again. I cannot tolerate what the rightwing parties say but can understand why there was a vote for change. The real left doesn\u2019t really exist any more.\u201d\n\nThe Salvini coalition also promised to cut taxes and revive Umbria\u2019s economy, which has been sluggish since the financial crisis of 2007.\n\nAlessandro Foresi, a bar owner, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an epochal change, but it\u2019s also a change that people wanted. They believed in what the rightwing alliance had to say. And if you look at the national government, they can\u2019t seem to progress.\u201d\n\nThe M5S and PD alliance, led by the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has been struggling to garner faith. Its six weeks in power have been blighted by bickering, particularly over the budget for 2020. Unlike the close-knit rightwing coalition, the former rivals only campaigned together in Umbria a few days before the election. M5S, which up until early this year was Italy\u2019s largest party, was the biggest loser, scoring just 7.4%.\n\nSalvini, who led a far-right rally in Rome on 19 October that was attended by thousands, said the government\u2019s days were numbered, while Meloni, whose party won 10% in Umbria, said: \u201cIf I was Conte, I\u2019d hand in my resignation faster than light.\u201d\n\nThe government will face its next test in regional elections in Calabria in December, followed by Emilia-Romagna, another leftwing stronghold, in January.", "description": "Alliance led by far right ends 50 years of leftwing rule in central Italian region", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d869231e30e08b0d74f3e987aad8ab84ddb4479a/0_5_1628_977/master/1628.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c184e6abc5fd07d02f5d90446da3466", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
