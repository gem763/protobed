Earlier Trump called the protests \u201criots\u201d that were a matter for China to deal with.\n\nRelated Coverage Hong Kong police fire tear gas to disperse protesters in Causeway Bay\n\nThe vandalism started in the evening. Police have responded to violence over 14 weeks with water cannon, rubber bullets and tear gas.\n\nRiot police cleared the Central MTR metro station, near Sunday\u2019s march, where activists smashed a long glass panel at a station entrance and other windows and daubed graffiti on the walls outside. Several arrests were made.\n\nActivists dug up bricks from pathways to break windows and set fires from cardboard boxes on the streets, building barricades with metal fencing.\n\nHundreds of others milled about surrounding streets lined with banks, jewellery shops and top-brand shopping arcades.\n\nHong Kong returned to China under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\n\u201cFOMENTING UNREST\u201d\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced concessions this week aimed at ending the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, which ignited the unrest in June. Many protesters said it was too little, too late.\n\nProtestors stand next to a fire at the entrance of MTR Central Station in Hong Kong, China September 8, 2019.

Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.\n\nBut the demonstrations have long since broadened into calls for democracy.\n\nU.S. legislation addressing China\u2019s actions in Hong Kong will be among the top priorities pushed by Senate Democrats when Congress returns to work after a recess next week, their leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, said on Thursday.\n\nSchumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican who sets the floor agenda, to bring up a bipartisan bill that would require an annual justification of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong, including special trade and business privileges, under the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.\n\nThe legislation, called the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would also mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city\u2019s autonomy are vulnerable to sanctions.\n\nProtesters, in a petition handed to the U.S. Consulate, urged that it be passed in full.\n\nTrump alternates between praising Chinese President Xi Jinping as a great leader and casting him as an enemy, while excoriating China for taking advantage of U.S. businesses.\n\nBeijing announced that top officials would head to Washington in early October to hold talks aimed at ending the tit-for-tat trade war, now in its second year, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.\n\nJoshua Wong, one of the leaders of the pro-democracy \u201cUmbrella\u201d movement five years ago, was re-arrested at the airport on Sunday on return from Germany and the United States for breaching bail conditions, he said.\n\nSlideshow (29 Images)\n\nHe had been charged with inciting and participating in an unauthorised assembly outside police headquarters on June 21 and released on bail.\n\n\u201cPreliminary legal advice suggested that the court had acknowledged and approved my trips to Germany and the U.S. when it granted bail on Aug. 30,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, it is believed that there are some mistakes have been made on the bail certificate.\u201d\n\nHe said he thought he would be freed on Monday.", "description": "Thousands of Hong Kong protesters on Sunday sang the Star Spangled Banner and called on U.S. President Donald Trump to \"liberate\" the Chinese-ruled city, before violence broke out in the latest in a three-month series of clashes and unrest.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427567918&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870EH", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
