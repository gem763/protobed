The boy fell about 100 feet. Bravery was caught and held by museum patrons who witnessed the incident until police arrived.\n\nAt an initial court hearing in August, it emerged that the child was visiting the modern art museum with his family on August 4 when he was approached by a stranger who allegedly picked him up and threw him off the viewing platform.\n\nOn Tuesday, Judge Nicholas Hilliard, sitting at the Old Bailey -- the central criminal court for England and Wales -- turned down an application to extend the suspect's anonymity as he is now 18.\n\nRead More", "description": "A teenager accused of throwing a young French boy from a viewing gallery at the Tate Modern art museum in London has been officially identified.", "authors": ["Lianne Kolirin"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190806112632-02-tate-modern-incident-0804-super-tease.jpg"}
