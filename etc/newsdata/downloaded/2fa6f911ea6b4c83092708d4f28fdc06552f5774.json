PCG 32.37% stocks and bonds have lost about $4.1 billion in the four trading days since the blaze in Sonoma County, Calif., started late Oct. 23, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. The stock has dropped 39%, cutting the utility\u2019s market capitalization to $2.7 billion on Tuesday, from a high of $37 billion in 2017.\n\nPG&E bond prices fell as much as 18%\u2014the biggest decline since a PG&E power line set off the devastating Camp Fire in Northern California last November.\n\nAbrams Capital Management LP, Baupost Group LLC, Elliott Management Corp., and V\u00e4rde Partners are among the dozens of hedge funds that have bought PG&E stocks or bonds. It was unclear how big the paper losses were for each fund in recent days and which investors sold securities.\n\nInvestors say the selloff has been driven by consternation over the Kincade Fire\u2019s spread and forecasts for extreme winds. An increase in the amount of wildfire claims against the bankrupt electric utility could wipe out its stock and leave too little for the company to repay bondholders in full.\n\n\u201cThe number one question for investors is are they on the hook for the Kincade Fire and if so how much will that cost,\u201d said Andrew DeVries, a bond analyst at the research firm CreditSights. \u201cThe answer is nobody knows.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty is threatening delicate negotiations between PG&E\u2019s investors, insurers and existing wildfire victims, which could stymie plans to bring the company out of bankruptcy, Mr. DeVries said.\n\nBondholders have pledged to invest billions of dollars in the company to pay out wildfire claims but made their commitments contingent on a provision that damage this fall from fires where PG&E operates not exceed 500 buildings, according to a version of their restructuring proposal filed in bankruptcy court. The Kincade blaze had destroyed or damaged 147 structures as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nA house burned in Healdsburg, Calif., on Sunday.

Under a settlement proposed in September by PG&E, Baupost would have stood to gain hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe big swings in PG&E securities are complicating hedge funds\u2019 efforts to profit from what some are describing as the first bankruptcy induced by climate change.\n\n\u201cClimate change has had a big impact on investing in California utilities, and the risk of fires is here to stay,\u201d said Stephen Byrd, head of utilities research at Morgan Stanley.\n\nPG&E said Thursday one of its power lines malfunctioned shortly before the Kincade Fire broke out last week. The company said on Monday that its power lines may have caused two small fires in a San Francisco suburb over the weekend.\n\nPG&E has in recent weeks generated criticism for deploying large, rolling blackouts in an effort to stem the risk of wildfires. But fires have sprouted despite those efforts, suggesting to some investors that California needs a more comprehensive approach to managing fire risk, such as building new power lines underground.\n\nCalifornia wildfires cost insurance companies more than $24 billion over the past two years. As those insurers look to cover their losses, here\u2019s a look at how homeowners like Grass Valley resident Christy Hubbard are paying the price.

The selling pushed prices lower, saddling bond investors with about $2.4 billion of paper losses, according to the Journal analysis of price changes in PG&E bonds that have traded since the close on Oct. 23. The analysis doesn\u2019t include securities that didn\u2019t trade this week. Shareholders took paper losses of about $1.7 billion over the same period.\n\nLosses on the bonds were concentrated in securities with high annual interest payments. Funds including Elliott had bought them, betting bondholders would recover as much as 130 cents on the dollar after accounting for past-due interest, analysts said. The possibility of losses from the Kincade Fire sent the bonds tumbling as much as 18% to prices as low as 90 cents on the dollar in recent days.\n\nIn addition to the fire, investors cited technical pressure, saying some hedge funds were looking to manage their risk heading into the end of the year.\n\nHedge funds betting on distressed assets have endured a rocky stretch this year as popular investments in the debt of Argentina and the telecommunication company Frontier Communications Corp. backfired. And for many investors, PG&E is their biggest position.\n\nA fallen PG&E transformer in Healdsburg, Calif.

Traders said that some bondholders were able to offset losses by shorting PG&E\u2019s stock before the Kincade fire and that some funds bought in as prices fell this week. The company\u2019s stock and some of its bonds rebounded slightly Tuesday.\n\nSome investors rebalanced their holdings before the fire. One of PG&E\u2019s largest shareholders, Redwood Capital Management LLC, sold some of its stock and bought bonds in recent months, according to a trader.\n\nOver the weekend, California Gov. Gavin Newsom told Bloomberg he wanted Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to make a public bid for the company. Mr. Buffett didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Gov. Newsom, a Democrat, declared a state of emergency this week. The Kincade Fire is the largest of several wildfires currently burning in California.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think will be the financial longevity of PG&E? Join the conversation below.\n\nWagers on PG&E have been popular for the past two years because it has billions of dollars of debt and equity outstanding, allowing hedge funds to bet large amounts on the utility\u2019s fate. The potential for low double-digit returns has been attractive to distressed-asset investors, as has the political and regulatory complexity around the company for funds betting on events.\n\nThe PG&E trade, turning many in the hedge-fund industry into amateur meteorologists, has been a roller coaster. It punished early investors including Baupost when the Camp Fire raged. It rewarded others including Abrams as well as Elliott when plans emerged to rescue the troubled utility.\n\n\u2014Alexander Gladstone and Nicole Friedman contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com and Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com", "description": "Investors in PG&E stocks and bonds have lost about $4.1 billion in the four trading days since the blaze in Sonoma County started.", "authors": ["Matt Wirz", "Juliet Chung", "Matthieu.Wirz Wsj.Com", "Juliet.Chung Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121887/social", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
