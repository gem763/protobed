The vote on the deal is set to go to the wire and is likely to prove critical for Britain's future in or out of the EU.\n\nJohnson's Conservative Party doesn't have a majority in the British Parliament, so the 10 votes of its allies, Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, could be decisive.\n\nHowever, the DUP has indicated it will vote against the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Johnson, because party leaders say it undermines Northern Ireland's bond with the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Saturday is not the end. Saturday is not even the beginning of the end, because there is a whole range of issues that have to be sorted out in the withdrawal agreement,\" DUP leader Arlene Foster said Friday.\n\nWithout the DUP, the prime minister will have to persuade some opposition members of Parliament to break ranks but opposition leaders have all rejected the deal, warning that it will give Prime Minister Johnson carte blanche to tear up regulations and workers' rights. Only a few Labour Party MPs are expected to vote for the revised agreement.", "description": "Britain's 'Super Saturday' as Brexit Vote Goes to Wire", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/19/2019101900353_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
