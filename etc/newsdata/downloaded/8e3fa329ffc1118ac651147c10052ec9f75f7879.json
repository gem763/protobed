'I think sometimes a look is worth a thousand words and the internalised judgement that she has passed on her father is not something that she would be able to verbalise, not at that stage of her life.\n\n'She\u2019d need 20 years of therapy to be able to explain to him why he was a problematic parent. But it was really interesting, it was a bit of a challenge but one that was incredibly exciting for me.'\n\nAlso speaking to MailOnline, Robert De Niro slammed US President Donald Trump as he spoke about how the film coming out now as a gangster movie and how it\u2019s relevant to the political landscape.\n\nArriving in style: De Niro and director Martin Scorsese looked dapper as they posed in their suits on the expansive red carpet\n\nPicture this: As the evening progressed, the stars posed on the red carpet with Al Pacino, who also stars in the upcoming film\n\nCasual: Pacino added casual touches to his ensemble, arriving at the event in a pair of running shoes and sporting sunglasses\n\nReady for the closeup: The famous Hollywood trio were all smiles as they posed for photographers gathered on the red carpet\n\nSaying it was 'relevant in a way', he told MailOnline: 'We\u2019ve been working on the movie for a long time, a bit more than 12 years, so that we\u2019re happy to get it finally finished, done and out there. How it relates to things politically?\n\n'Well we have a gangster in the White House, but he\u2019s not even a good gangster, he\u2019s not smart, he\u2019s stupid, he doesn\u2019t keep his word.\n\n'There\u2019s an expression, honour amongst thieves as in any profession that has honour and they shake your hand and say it\u2019s done no matter what.\n\n'And there are those in Wall Street who don\u2019t do that, and he happens to be one of the guys who don\u2019t honour anything so he doesn\u2019t fit in any category except being a malignant narcissist who has no idea what he\u2019s doing.'\n\nSlammed: Speaking to MailOnline at the premiere, Robert De Niro slammed US President Donald Trump as he spoke about how the film coming out now as a gangster movie and how it\u2019s relevant to the political landscape\n\nStylish: The film-maker attended the event with his wife of 20 years, Helen Morris, who looked stylish in a velvet trouser suit\n\nReflective: Though the film's genre and cast has led some to expect a gangster thriller in the mould of GoodFellas or Casino, The Irishman is a more reflective, less flashy rumination on morality, violence and American power\n\nEffects: Through de-aging effects, the performances by De Niro, Joe Pesci and Pacino span decades of their characters' lives\n\nHarvey Keitel, who was also at the premiere, spoke with MailOnline about the difference between working with De Niro, Al Pacino, and director Martin Scorsese this time around, compared to their past projects.\n\n'I hope I\u2019m right when I say I think we\u2019ve mellowed somewhat,' he said. 'I don\u2019t think anybody has slowed down at all, I think things have gotten deeper, richer, more vital. We won\u2019t slow down, we\u2019re not going to go gentle into that good night.'\n\nHe added of the film: 'I think personally it\u2019s a very timely film in terms of its politics, in terms of the soul it deals with. I think it\u2019s as relevant now than ever. The corruption of politics, how we\u2019ve trampled on our souls in this time, very relevant.'\n\nThe Irishman, which hits UK screens on November 8, is the latest gangster film from the celebrated director.\n\nSolo: After posing for snapshots with his Hollywood friends, actor Pacino took some time out to pose solo for photographers\n\nShades: The star wore a pair of large statement rings to the event, though his sunglasses appeared to be his prized accessory\n\nDate night: Harvey Keitel, who also stars in the upcoming movie, attended the event with his wife of 18 years, Daphna Kastner\n\nBlack: Arriving at the star-studded event holding hands, the pair coordinated their looks, stepping out in all-black ensembles\n\nThe film is the ninth feature collaboration between De Niro and Scorsese and their first since Casino in 1995.\n\nThough the film's genre and cast has led some to expect a gangster thriller in the mould of GoodFellas or Casino, The Irishman is a more reflective, less flashy rumination on morality, violence and American power.\n\nThrough de-aging visual effects, the performances by De Niro, Joe Pesci and Pacino span decades of their characters' lives.\n\nIt stars De Niro as Sheeran, a mafia hitman and high-ranking Teamster official.\n\nShortly before his death, the real Sheeran confessed to killing Jimmy Hoffa (played here by Pacino) \u2014 a confession that remains in dispute, with Hoffa's disappearance officially unsolved.\n\nSay it with flowers: Scottish broadcasting personality Edith Bowman turned heads as she arrived in a plunging floral gown\n\nGolden girl: The radio DJ opted to largely forgo accessories, save for a pair of gold earrings and selection of statement rings\n\nScorsese called his film 'an interesting hybrid' as both something made for theatres and for watching at home.\n\n'All of us now are in an extraordinary time of change,' Scorsese said. 'But when it comes down to it, I felt - Bob (De Niro) felt - the picture had to be made for ourselves.'\n\nScorsese described the CGI used to digitally de-age De Niro, Pacino and Pesci in his new film as 'an evolution of make-up' at the event.\n\nHe said: 'If we made the film earlier they could have played younger but at a certain point we missed that and then they said \"use younger actors\" and I said \"what\u2019s the point of that?\" CGI is really an evolution of make-up, you accept certain norms in make-up, you know he\u2019s not that old, she\u2019s not that young, you accept the illusion.'\n\nVIP guest: Hugh Grant was also among the attendees, hitting the red carpet with his wife of one year, Anna Elisabet Eberstein\n\nBig night on the town: British actor Stephen Graham arrived at the hot ticket event with his wife of 11 years, Hannah Walters\n\nSuits you, sir! The Liverpudlian This Is England star stepped out in style, donning a blue suit for the star-studded gathering\n\nPacino added: 'I saw the film without any work, without effects and it was fine. I\u2019m not the only one who felt that way. I think it\u2019s really good we have it, we have this potential and it\u2019s exercised in the film.\n\n'In the old days they put an actor we all knew and love and put grey hair on him and we would be like \"oh he got older\", and you accept it because it\u2019s in the story.'\n\nDe Niro said: 'I always joke my career will be extended another 30 years, where it will evolve.\n\n'I am just happy we are at the beginning stages of it being explored and God knows where we will go and what excited me about it was Pablo (Helman, the visual effects supervisor) was doing this thing and wanted to make it state of the art, the best it could be.'\n\nScorsese explained of the fact that the film will stream on Netflix after the company agreed to foot the bill for the expensive CGI: 'Having the backing of a company that says you will have no interference, the trade-off is it streams with theatrical distribution prior to that, I thought that is the chance we take.'\n\n'The new technology is bringing things that are unimaginable and not only is it something extraordinarily good for narrative films, narrative stores told emphasising motion picture images, but it opens up the original conception of what a film is and how it is to be seen has now changed so radically.\n\n'One thing that should always be protected as much as possible, and I think will always be there, is a communal experience and I think that is best in a theatre.\n\n'Homes are becoming theatres too but it\u2019s a major change and I think one has to keep an open mind. There is no doubt seeing a film with an audience is really important.'\n\nShining: Actress Andrea Riseborough had all eyes on her as she arrived wearing a glittering silver dress with bursts of chiffon\n\nStatement: Her sleeveless gown featured a deeply plunging neckline and was teamed with a selection of bold statement rings\n\nMakeup: Styling her flaxen tresses in a wavy bun, the British beauty added a touch of deep red lipstick to her captivating look\n\nTuxedos: (L-R) Comedians David Walliams and Jimmy Carr looked dapper as they arrived at the event in stylish tuxedos\n\nOf Marvel-type movies he said: 'The value of a film that is like a theme park film, Marvel-type pictures, where theatres become amusement parks, that\u2019s a different experience.\n\n'It\u2019s not cinema, it\u2019s something else, we shouldn\u2019t be invaded by it, so that is a big issue and we need the theatre owners to step up to allow theatres to show films that are narrative films.'\n\nDe Niro shot to success overnight when he was cast in the Godfather Part II (1974) alongside Pacino, while Keitel hit the big time after performing in Mean Streets (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976).\n\nThe Irishman premiered on September 27 at the New York Film Festival, finally raising the curtain on the director's long-awaited, 209-minute crime-drama opus.\n\nThe Irishman is released in cinemas on November 8 ahead of its launch on Netflix.\n\nStephanie Kurtzuba and Welker White\n\n.", "description": "She holds the distinction of being the second-youngest person to scoop an Academy Award when she received the coveted Best Supporting Actress trophy at the tender age of 11.", "authors": ["Ryan Smith", "Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/17/19660932-0-image-a-15_1570985519164.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
