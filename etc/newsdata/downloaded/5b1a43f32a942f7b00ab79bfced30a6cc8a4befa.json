Biden Jr. and his son Hunter appears to center on a joint venture that involved the younger Mr. Biden and some of China\u2019s leading state-owned financial companies.\n\nBut the president\u2019s claims bear little if any relation to the known facts.\n\nWithout presenting any evidence, Mr. Trump suggested on Thursday that China showered $1.5 billion on Hunter Biden in order to influence his father and win favorable trade deals with the United States.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably why China for so many years has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the U.S.A.\u201d because they deal with people like \u201cBiden where they give the son a billion and a half dollars,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cYou know what they call that? They call that a payoff.\u201d\n\nCompanies associated with Hunter Biden or his business partners have struck several deals involving China over the past decade. So, in fact, have Mr. Trump\u2019s own relatives \u2014 a point that Mr. Trump does not mention in his now almost-daily accusations against the former vice president, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son.", "description": "Without presenting any evidence, President Trump suggested that China showered money on Mr. Biden to influence his father as vice president and win favorable trade deals with the United States.", "authors": ["Sharon Lafraniere", "Michael Forsythe"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/multimedia/03dc-hunterbiden2/merlin_162077214_fcec7317-a8f0-4cf9-b59e-09f9c3b59048-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
