The euro fell slightly against the dollar to near its weakest point since May 2017, with one euro buying $1.089.\n\nThe latest eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index data dropped to 45.6 in September, its lowest level since 2012. The data for September from Spain, Italy and Germany were all below 50, indicating contraction.\n\nThe German PMI reading was weakest, hitting its lowest level since the 2009 financial crisis.\n\nThe reading confirmed that \"the eurozone's growth engine is sputtering,\" said London Capital Group analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya.\n\nSuch economic shakiness means the European Central Bank \"will need to add more oil to the engine,\" and it will fuel expectations of a more accommodative central-bank policy and increased downside pressure on the euro, she added.\n\nWeakness in the euro is a reflection of slower economic growth in Europe compared with the U.S., combined with a sense among investors that the ECB will have to be more aggressive than the Federal Reserve to counteract a slowdown.\n\n\"We need to see much more drastic rate cuts from the Fed to turn the euro higher against the dollar,\" said Lauri H\u00e4likk\u00e4, fixed income and currency strategist at SEB.\n\nAmong individual stocks, U.K. cafe chain Greggs led the Stoxx Europe 600 lower, down more than 8%. The company, known for its pastry-wrapped sausage rolls, reiterated a warning that it is preparing for the U.K.'s departure from the European Union and that there are pressures on labor and food costs.\n\nGovernment bond yields were mostly higher Tuesday, with the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys rising to 1.734%, from 1.667% Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nEarlier in the day, Australia's benchmark index rose 0.8% after the Australian central bank cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a record low 0.75% and left the door open to more cuts. The country's economy has been buffeted by the economic slowdown in China, a key customer for Australian raw materials.\n\nIn Japan, the Nikkei climbed 0.6%, despite data showing sentiment among Japanese large manufacturers falling to its weakest level in over six years. Strong domestic demand and growing investment activity likely limited the decline, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Chief Japan Economist Takuji Aida said.\n\nInvestors were trying to gauge how Japan's increase in local sales tax, which came into effect Tuesday, would affect consumer spending.\n\nHong Kong and mainland Chinese stock markets were closed for a holiday.\n\nIn commodities, oil futures for Brent crude rose 1.2%.\n\nOn Monday, stocks in the U.S. finished the third quarter higher, with the S&P 500 turning in its best performance in the first nine months of a year since 1997.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 08:07 ET (12:07 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
