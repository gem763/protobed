Bill McRaven said at the New America Special Operations Forces Policy Forum Wednesday, adding, \"I've said on occasion negotiating with the Taliban is like negotiating with ISIS.\"\n\n\"And, maybe that's not a good comparison,\" he admitted.\n\n\"But,\" the admiral continued, \"I do believe that if we negotiate some sort of settlement with the Taliban, and that settlement involves the withdrawal of all US troops from Afghanistan, that, you know, it won't be six months or a year before all of the blood and treasure we have put into Afghanistan will have been reversed because the Taliban will come back in and do what the Taliban do.\"\n\nThe president revealed earlier this month that he had intended to host Taliban leaders at Camp David, a presidential retreat, for peace talks.\n\nTrump called announced the planned meeting in a tweet, in which he also canceled the meeting in response to a bombing that killed a US soldier. The secret meeting was initially scheduled to take place the Sunday before 9/11, a plan that drew a backlash.\n\nCalling off peace negotiations with the Taliban, the president declared that talks were \"dead\" in discussions with reporters. \"As far as I'm concerned, they're dead,\" he said.\n\nPrior to these unexpected developments, the Trump administration had been working tirelessly to achieve a negotiated peace to the war in Afghanistan, a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly two decades and claimed well over two thousand US lives. The president had repeatedly made his desire to pull US troops out of the Middle East known, and the deal the US was working on was expected to lead to a drawdown.\n\nAnd now, there again appears to be no end in sight.\n\n\"I've said we have to accept the fact \u2014 I think we do \u2014 that we're going to be there for a very long time,\" McRaven said Wednesday.\n\n\"Is it forever? I don't think anything's for forever. But does that mean that we will lose more young men and women? Does that mean we're going to spend another billions of dollars? I think it does,\" the admiral, who oversaw the 2011 bin Laden raid as head of Joint Special Operations Command, explained.\n\n\"Is there an opportunity for us to negotiate with the Taliban, get them to negotiate something that is a win-win? I don't know. I have my doubts on that.\"\n\nRead more: Trump said he's hitting Taliban 'harder than they have ever been hit before' hours after a rocket strike near the US embassy on 9/11 anniversary\n\nSince talks collapsed, the fighting appears to have intensified, and in recent days, extremists have carried out a number of deadly bombings across Afghanistan. On more than one occasion, Trump, who previously criticized McRaven for not getting bin Laden sooner, has said that the US is now hitting the Taliban \"harder than they have ever been hit before,\" although it remains unclear how much US operations have been ramped up.\n\nNOW WATCH: We went inside Border Patrol boot camp and found the Academy isn't training agents for the job the White House is asking them to do", "description": "Talking to the Taliban is like meeting with ISIS, the retired Navy SEAL said weeks after Trump tried to bring Taliban leaders to the US for talks.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pZkHhNzHD8_kOf2JFBYGuw--~B/aD0yMTc4O3c9MjkwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/a57df6fe5bec36e25477c0ca66ffca36", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
