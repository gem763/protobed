Just this week, President Donald Trump touted his campaign promise of building a wall at the U.S. southern border while speaking south of San Diego.\n\n\u201cIt's a very powerful, very powerful wall, the likes of which probably to this extent has not been built before,\u201d Trump said while showing off a portion of the 30-foot-tall bollard wall. \u201cPlus it's designed to absorb heat, so it's extremely hot. The wall is, you won't be able to touch it. You can fry an egg on that wall. It's very, very hot.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a debate that\u2019s dominated headlines and divided the country. But for the lifelong Republican sheriff, the border is much more than a policy dispute.\n\n\u201cThe border is clearly a public safety threat to my county because of the drug and human trafficking that comes across that border,\u201d Napier said. \u201cPublic safety's not a partisan issue, it's not a political issue. It's quality of life, it's a human condition issue. So partisanship and political ideology should not intersect [with] what I do to maintain public safety in my county.\u201d\n\nNapier said that in Pima County, in \u201csome places, the only way to get to those areas are by air or hiking.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nWithin a few miles of the international border, Napier noted that there\u2019s \u201cvery undeveloped land -- vast expanses of desert areas that somebody coming to this country between the ports of entry have to navigate.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy deputies do recover almost 100 bodies a year in the deserts of this county,\u201d he said. \u201cThat taxes our resources, but it also pulls at my strings from a humanitarian standpoint.\u201d\n\nChief Medical Examiner Greg Hess and his team work to identify remains recovered in the desert -- a grim situation that he said has worsened since the early 2000s.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cSo far this year...to date in 2019, we've recovered 92 suspected undocumented border cross remains,\u201d Hess said. \u201cWe went from...75 [remains recovered] in the year 2000. In 2001, it was 77. In 2002, it was 145.\u201d\n\nThe incomplete remains of an unidentified migrant discovered earlier this year laid on Hess\u2019 exam table.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cThat was somebody's father, that that was somebody's brother, somebody's son,\u201d Napier said. \u201cThat's a human being, and a human being probably driven by very desperate decisions in their home country to make a very dangerous and illegal ingress in the United States that cost them their lives.\u201d\n\nNapier said Trump was correct in that \u201cwe need to secure our southern border.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do understand the desperation,\u201d Napier said of those who cross the border. But he added that it\u2019s not safe. \u201cDo not come into this country illegally because you\u2019re going to [be] victimized by criminals [and] by the environment.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nThe vast majority of immigrants have entered the country legally, including asylum seekers like Angel Ramos.\n\nLast year, Ramos and his son Fernando fled Honduras. Like many Central American families, they say they had no choice but to take the risk.\n\n\u201cThere, everything is controlled by gangs. And, well, now that you\u2019re older, they want you to sell drugs, to do so many things\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Ramos told \u201cNightline\u201d in June.\n\n\u201cMy son is the most precious thing for me [so] I didn\u2019t want to be involved in those bad things,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cYou can imagine my son. How is he going to grow up without a father? Because over there, if you do something bad, they kill you.\u201d\n\nThe father and son made the perilous three-month journey on foot, bus and train to reach the U.S. border.\n\nUnlike the hundreds of thousands who have crossed into the U.S. illegally, Ramos said he wanted to do it the right way -- petitioning for asylum to U.S. immigration officials at the Nogales Port of Entry.\n\nAfter a few days, immigration officials released Ramos and his son at a Tucson, Arizona, shelter. The two are allowed to stay in the U.S. as their asylum case makes it through the courts.\n\nBut new policies under the Trump administration are making it harder for asylum seekers like Ramos to seek refuge.\n\nABC\n\nWhile immigration dominates headlines, another constant concern on the border is stemming the flow of illegal drugs, the majority of which pass through legal ports of entry.\n\nSergeant Patrick Hilliker is with the Border Interdiction Unit at the Pima County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\u201cWe are usually directly involved in finding, or assisting other agencies in finding, hundreds of pounds a year,\u201d Hilliker said. \u201cYou can imagine how much is probably getting through and how much is actually in this country right now.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nHilliker showed \u201cNightline\u201d what he said was approximately 14 pounds of heroin that had been seized.\n\n\u201cThis one, in particular, you can see they're in vacuum-sealed bags and that's to contain the smell and make it so the dogs don't smell it.\u201d\n\nThe southwest border has long been the primary entry point for heroin. In 2017, nearly 1,000 pounds of heroin came through the Tucson sector.\n\n\u201cNightline\u201d joined Hilliker and some of his team to stake out what they believe is a \u201cstash house.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they see something that looks like there's some smuggling going on, we\u2019ll go try to stop the vehicle and talk with them,\u201d Hilliker said.\n\n\u201cAny way you can think of smuggling narcotics into this country, it\u2019s been done,\u201d Hilliker added. He listed drugs that were found inside of car \u201cradiators, fake battery compartments [and] fake flooring. They\u2019ll take everything out of the vehicle and put in a fake floor, reweld it, put carpet back over it\u2026put the seats back on and it\u2019s very difficult to find.\u201d\n\nTraffickers not only use any method necessary to do business, they also use smugglers from all walks of life.\n\n\u201cThey will pay people into bringing this stuff up and it's quick money,\u201d Hilliker said. \u201cSometimes, there's elderly people that are doing it, younger people, different nationalities, different citizenships.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe opiate addiction is a public health emergency,\u201d Napier said. \u201cThis is really the front line of a national issue, right here in our counties. But we have to bifurcate the issue of illegal immigration from transnational crime. They're not exactly the same thing, although they intersect one another once in a while.\u201d\n\nFor Napier, these aren\u2019t faraway threats but realities in his backyard -- nuances too often lost in the noise.\n\n\u201cWe need to secure our border for public safety reasons, national security reasons and human rights reasons,\u201d Napier said. \u201cNo one can argue past those three points. Let's get it done.\u201d", "description": "\u201cSo far this year...to date in 2019, we've recovered 92 suspected undocumented border cross remains,\u201d the Arizona medical examiner said.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/cross-sunset-abc-ay-190919_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
