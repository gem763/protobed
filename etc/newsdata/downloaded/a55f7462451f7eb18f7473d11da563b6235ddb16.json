But I just felt an hour ago, \u201cEurgh, I wanna delete this app.\u201d\n\n\u2018You get sucked back into it again and it takes you away from real life. That\u2019s the least of the worst scenarios.\u2019\n\nThe 22-year-old also admitted to \u2018tearing up\u2019 to Jesy Nelson\u2019s Odd One Out documentary about bullying and online trolls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I teared up \u2013 that made such a big impression on me,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Not to that point but I definitely felt the depths of struggling, and when I heard that, I just really felt what she was saying.\n\n\u2018I felt her pain, and for somebody to rise out of that place takes so much strength.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
