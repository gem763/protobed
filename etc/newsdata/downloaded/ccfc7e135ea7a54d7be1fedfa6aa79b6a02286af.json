Counter District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a release.\n\nThe case remains under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, which has jurisdiction in West Hollywood.\n\nThe charge comes after video footage emerged earlier this week showing Dick involved in a separate incident involving an Uber Eats driver in Los Angeles.\n\nTMZ\u2019s video appears to show Dick engaged in a physical altercation with the Uber Eats driver. Law enforcement sources told TMZ that police are currently investigating the incident.\n\nThe misdemeanor charge against Dick represents something of a twist for ride-sharing companies, which are facing multiple lawsuits involving alleged acts of sexual assault committed by their drivers.\n\nRidesharing company Lyft was hit this year with a nationwide lawsuit from 14 women who claim they were sexually assaulted and raped by their drivers.\n\nUber has also contended with a slew of allegations involving its drivers, including the case of a driver in Pennsylvania who was found guilty earlier this year of raping an intoxicated passenger.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
