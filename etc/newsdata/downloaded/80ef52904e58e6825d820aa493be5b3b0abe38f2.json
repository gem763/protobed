He also hopes his story, God\u2019s Hostage: A True Story of Persecution, Imprisonment, and Perseverance, will pave the way to erasing the image of Christianity as a threat increasingly present in Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe pastor and his wife, Norine, were initially arrested in 2016 and brought to immigration authorities in the aftermath of the failed coup against Erdogan that year. Brunson was soon after accused of a host of crimes that 66 senators referred to in a letter to Erdogan as \u201crandom character assassination\u201d: military espionage, a plot to overthrow the government, support for terrorist organizations, and, perhaps most indicative of Erdogan\u2019s true objection to Brunson\u2019s presence in his country, \u201cChristianization.\u201d\n\nHysterical pro-Erdogan Turkish media referred to Brunson as the \u201cRambo Priest.\u201d He stood accused of leading the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, though he is a pastor and teaching elder at the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. Prosecutors claimed he was a devotee of Fethullah G\u00fclen, the U.S.-based Islamic cleric Erdogan accused of staging the coup against him (the elderly G\u00fclen denies involvement). Brunson was also allegedly helping the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) \u2013 a Marxist, U.S.-designated terrorist organization \u2013 by \u201crunning boatloads of cash to Israel to then transfer to the PKK,\u201d he told Breitbart News in a phone conversation.\n\nProsecutors never clarified how Brunson could be an agent for multiple Christian denominations, a Muslim service movement, and a presumably atheist Marxist group at the same time. The charges were so convoluted, prone to erratic changes, and poorly presented that Brunson, at one point in God\u2019s Hostage, asks, \u201cHow can I defend myself when I don\u2019t even know what the charges are against me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, but it didn\u2019t have to make any sense,\u201d Brunson told Breitbart News. \u201cThey accused me of different things at different times. They were trying to find something that would fit, so they would change their minds a lot and then they would drop the previous accusations.\u201d\n\nIn September 2017, Erdogan openly haggled for G\u00fclen\u2019s extradition, using Brunson as a bargaining chip.\n\n\u201cWe have given you all the documents necessary [for the extradition of G\u00fclen]. But they say, \u2018give us the pastor.\u2019 You have another pastor in your hands. Give us that pastor and we will do what we can in the judiciary to give you this one,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said at the time. U.S. authorities insist that, contra Erdogan\u2019s claims, Turkish officials have provided no legitimate evidence to extradite G\u00fclen.\n\nTurkish prosecutors are seeking 3,600 life sentences for G\u00fclen, who is 78 years old.\n\nWhile Erdogan attempted to use him to acquire G\u00fclen, Brunson believes that the biggest threat he presented to Erdogan was simply existing as a Christian in a country ruled by Islamists.\n\n\u201cThey threw other things in that kind of betrayed what they were really after, which was \u2018Christianization,'\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is obviously not illegal to tell people about Jesus, but it was presented as some nefarious plot to Christianize the Kurds and, in that way, cause the division of Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe territory historically covering Kurdistan contains regions of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Southern Turkey is largely Kurdish and home to a PKK uprising. Cities like Diyarbakir and Mardin have experienced years of military raids, government curfews, and infringements on their rights meant, Ankara insists, to eradicate the PKK threat. The PKK has fought for decades to split southern Turkey for the creation of a sovereign Kurdistan.\n\nBrunson never discussed politics in his sermons, he said, nor did prosecutors ever present real evidence that he had ties to Kurdish separatists.\n\n\u201cThe idea of Christianization \u2013 much of the evidence they presented to support these arguments was our actual work \u2026 [we said] this is just evidence that we are what we say we are, which is that we work in a church and tell people about Jesus,\u201d he noted.\n\nBrunson insists that the fear of Christianity Erdogan\u2019s government has promoted is misplaced, first and foremost because being Christian is an individual choice.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we can\u2019t Christianize anything,\u201d he told Breitbart News. \u201cPeople may think that, some have said, \u2018Why are you in Turkey shoving Christianity down the throats of Muslims? That is not at all what we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go over and we don\u2019t talk about Muhammed, we don\u2019t talk about the Quran, we don\u2019t talk about Islam. We don\u2019t attack them at all. What we do is present Christianity positively, which is to say, what the Bible teaches and who Jesus is, and we do this with people who are interested, people who come to us and ask questions,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe teach them to pay their taxes, to submit to their government, to pray for their political leaders, and we did that regularly in our church, so there is no reason for the Turkish government to be afraid of Christianization.\u201d\n\nHe added that Christians have no track record in the modern world of destabilizing Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cWhere has that happened that Christians are tearing a state apart? That\u2019s just not happening,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cWhere in the Muslim world are there a bunch of Christians leading an uprising against a Muslim government?\u201d\n\nBrunson credits God with using the \u201cevil\u201d done to him to do \u201csomething very powerful, raising millions of people around the world to pray for Turkey.\u201d He remains grateful and committed to spreading God\u2019s message. Yet his memoir differs significantly from many similar narratives of persecuted Christians in that Brunson speaks candidly about his suffering in prison and how it led him to question his faith \u2013 and come out even more devout.\n\n\u201cGod picked the wrong man,\u201d he lamented to wife Norine on one occasion recounted in the book. He openly admits, \u201cI felt abandoned by God.\u201d He told Breitbart News that what he experienced was the \u201csilence\u201d of God and that it made his faith grow.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an intentional decision to go in that direction, it\u2019s that we wanted to be very accurate \u2026 the book is not comprehensive, but it is accurate and it describes the struggle that I had,\u201d Brunson told Breitbart News. Asking others who knew persecuted Christians, he said he found that \u201cmany people who have been in prison have the same struggle where there are rays of light, you could say, occasionally, but where they often experience the silence of God.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Brunson writes, he experiences a moment in which, in complete spiritual surrender, he feels his heart reaching out to Jesus, breaking through the strengthening doubt. He described that moment to Breitbart News as \u201cGod giving me a gift, which was showing me my heart. Usually, when we talk about God revealing our heart to us, it\u2019s a scary thing \u2013 like, \u2018Oh no, He\u2019s going to reveal all the things that are wrong with me.\u2019 Actually, what He showed me was that I had a sincere love, but this had now been tested. Our love can be completely sincere and true, but [when] it has been tested \u2026 and you come out it, it\u2019s a proven love, and that\u2019s a bit different.\u201d\n\nBrunson writes that he had never knowingly met a following of G\u00fclen\u2019s Islamic movement \u2013 called Hizmet but referred to by Erdogan\u2019s government as the \u201cFethullahist Terrorist Organization (FETO)\u201d \u2013 but, despite \u201cChristianization\u201d being among his crimes, he was classified as a Gulenist in prison and kept in a cell with others accused of the same. As such, he is one of the few alleged \u201cGulenists\u201d caught in the post-coup Erdogan purge to have escaped, and his the only English-language narrative of how Turkey has treated its imprisoned \u201cGulenists.\u201d\n\nErdogan\u2019s forces detained over 110,000 in the aftermath of the coup and imprisoned nearly 50,000. In June, 151 people were sentenced to life in prison for being alleged Gulenist coup plotters.\n\nOf those Brunson met \u2013 he shared a cell with an estimated 30 people in his over two years detained \u2013 \u201cnot a single one of them was involved with anything to do with the coup,\u201d he told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThere are no doubt some Gulenists who were involved with the coup, there are a lot of questions about that \u2026 but the people I was in prison with \u2026 most of them were fathers whose children are growing up without having their father at home, and that\u2019s just a terrible injustice,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as I can tell these were innocent people. Some of them were related to the movement, but they were not involved in any violence or subverting the state.\u201d\n\nErdogan insisted throughout the process that he had no control over it, as he is president and has no power over the judicial branch. The Turkish judiciary finally freed Pastor Brunson in October 2018, a year ago. The trigger: crippling U.S. sanctions ordered by President Donald Trump as retribution for violating Brunson\u2019s human rights.\n\nNow home, Brunson describes his ordeal as an \u201cattack\u201d on his person, but one that allowed God to manifest and shed light on a population long starved of the power of Christian prayer.\n\n\u201cI think that there was an attack on me and, obviously, there are spiritual forces involved in that. And the Turkish government is the one that arrested me and then unjustly held me. And especially the Turkish leaders did that. So they get the credit for what they did, they held me unjustly,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cBut I also say that there\u2019s another side to the story, the God story, which is that God \u2013 behind all of the political intrigue that was going on and the injustice \u2013 God was also involved. And I say the Turkish govt stole two years of my life, but God redeemed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey intended to cause me harm, they did harm me, but God also turned it around to bring a lot of good. And that good specifically I can see, one major thing, is that I became a magnet for prayer, and millions of people around the world were praying for me.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Pastor Andrew Brunson \"became a magnet for prayer,\" bringing purpose to the years he spent in prison in Turkey.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1156379924-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
