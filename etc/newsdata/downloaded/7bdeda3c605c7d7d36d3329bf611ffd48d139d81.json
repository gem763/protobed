She freely admits the \u201ccertitude\u201d and \u201csanctimony\u201d of her younger self. After a few years as a correspondent covering the Bosnian war, she found that her new Harvard Law School classmates didn\u2019t know or care about the genocide unfolding there, so she stuffed a New York Times report on the Srebrenica massacre into every first-year\u2019s mailbox. Her scholarship and activism on that topic culminated in \u201cA Problem From Hell,\u201d her incredible 2002 history of American apathy during the 20th century\u2019s worst ethnic conflicts. The Pulitzer Prize-winning book held that officials justified noninterference when even minimal efforts, from public shaming to sanctions, could have saved countless lives. \u201cDecent men and women chose to look away,\u201d she wrote. Power was, in this period, a voice of piercing moral clarity.\n\nThen she went to work for Barack Obama.\n\nDuring her stints with him in the Senate, on the presidential campaign and inside the White House, pundits and critics wondered how the human rights advocate would reconcile her belief that America must act to protect vulnerable people with the dirty business of policymaking, where concessions taint every action. She finally answers in \u201cThe Education of an Idealist,\u201d her new memoir. It\u2019s a confusing title, because Power never becomes disillusioned, never sheds her views, never admits that governing and certitude are awkward bedfellows. It\u2019s unclear what \u201ceducation\u201d she received; scales do not fall from these eyes. \u201cThe old and new Samantha know each other quite well,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey talk all the time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a difficult proposition to swallow from someone who worked for an administration that assassinated hundreds of enemies (and bystanders) by drone and failed to take any action when Syria gassed its own citizens, crossing Obama\u2019s declared \u201cred line.\u201d What happened to holding killers accountable? Had a decent woman chosen to look away?\n\nYet Power\u2019s apologia is insistent \u2014 and unexpectedly compelling. She cannot justify every administration policy, and she flays many of its most cynical decisions, such as Obama\u2019s broken campaign promise to recognize the Armenian genocide. This tale is filled with half-measures, disappointments and bureaucratic defeats (a far cry from the usual autobiographical victory tour). But Power argues that activism on the inside, even when it fails, is no betrayal of pressure from the outside. \u201cThe reason I was exercising my voice before was to influence people in jobs like the one I now have,\u201d she tells friends. \u201cA voice is not an end in itself.\u201d Power uses her position to agitate for refugees, rape victims, persecuted LGBT populations, political prisoners and oppressed minorities everywhere. She isn\u2019t in charge, and she often fails to persuade her colleagues. (\u201cWe\u2019ve all read your book, Samantha,\u201d Obama snaps during one Situation Room meeting.) But she walks away with a list of real human rights accomplishments that may not have happened if she hadn\u2019t joined up. \u201cBetter is good, and better is actually a lot harder than worse,\u201d Obama reassures her.\n\nGovernment service is a big adjustment, and at first Power hates it. Some of her co-workers believe that human rights are \u201cin tension with, if not antithetical to, our traditional security concerns,\u201d she writes, a challenge to her work overseeing multilateral affairs and human rights for the National Security Council. She is annoyed that regional experts, government lawyers, press officials and congressional liaisons all get to weigh in on (and dilute) her every proposal: \u201cI was stunned by the number of cooks in the kitchen.\u201d And on big topics \u2014 whether to join a land-mine treaty or how to partner with the authoritarian Chinese government to contain North Korea \u2014 she complains that she is \u201cnot respected, not effective.\u201d \u201cI did not have the relationships, the clout, or the mastery of bureaucratic processes I needed to maximize my impact.\u201d\n\nIn a chapter called \u201cTurnaround,\u201d she explains how she found her groove. The late diplomat Richard Holbrooke tells her not to waste time where she can\u2019t make a difference: \u201cGo where they ain\u2019t.\u201d She realizes that doggedness really leads to progress, so she picks her goals more judiciously. As a result, she opens America\u2019s doors to Iraqi refugees who had aided the U.S. reconstruction effort. She makes friends with several female National Security Council aides, and they confide in each other and share tips, even when they disagree on policy matters. (Obama\u2019s council \u201cwas the most male-dominated place I had ever been in the United States.\u201d) She sets up an atrocity-prevention unit, so the government has a mechanism for spotting massacres around the world before they happen. In her telling, she rescues a lackluster draft of Obama\u2019s Nobel acceptance speech with a new framework, and they pull an all-nighter with his speechwriters revising it. She sends her husband, Cass Sunstein, another Obama aide who worked on domestic policy, a one-line email. \u201cRevelation: I love my job.\u201d\n\nThe greatest challenge to Power\u2019s idealism comes out of Damascus in 2013. When Syria\u2019s government kills 1,400 civilians with sarin in an opposition-held suburb, Obama initially surprises her by ordering unilateral airstrikes. She is by then the U.S. ambassador at the United Nations, and he tells her to get U.N. officials out of Syria. But the secretary general declines \u2014 he doesn\u2019t want to seem like he\u2019s paving the way for American bombs \u2014 and by the time the officials conclude their work, 10 days later, Obama has changed his mind. Now he wants permission from Congress for a strike.\n\nPower is aghast, and she rues not criticizing this move more forcefully. \u201cI phrased my apprehension as a question,\u201d she says, recounting a key meeting. \u201cWhat happens if Congress doesn\u2019t support you? Does that mean Assad could just keep using chemical weapons, and they would become like a conventional weapon of war?\u201d Obama is convinced that lawmakers will back him. Of course, they don\u2019t; their constituents revile the idea of another conflict. (As Power had written in \u201cA Problem From Hell,\u201d \u201cIt is in the realm of domestic politics that the battle to stop genocide is lost.\u201d) So President Bashar al-Assad suffers no consequences. \u201cAssad could reasonably conclude that, going forward, he could starve his people into submission, carpet bomb hospitals and schools, and eventually even resume chemical weapons attacks.\u201d\n\nShe mulls whether to quit, but a mentor points out that \u201cthere will just be more like-minded people in the Situation Room.\u201d And so she otherwise plays the good soldier. As the administration rushes to normalize relations with junta-led Myanmar, she objects that the country isn\u2019t changing quickly enough to justify dropping sanctions. The dissident Nobelist Aung San Suu Kyi agrees, arguing that a planned visit by Obama would reward the regime. But when Obama dispatches Power to convince Suu Kyi \u2014 who horrifies Power by essentially excusing the slaughter of Muslim Rohingya \u2014 Power does as she\u2019s told. Later, she partly redeems Obama\u2019s inaction in Syria by negotiating a U.N. Security Council resolution, alongside her Russian counterpart (an avuncular but stubborn foil during her years in Turtle Bay), to destroy some of Assad\u2019s chemical weapons.\n\nA leitmotif is Power\u2019s changing relationship with Obama as the presidency weighs on him. The two grow authentically close during his Senate years, and they swap jokes and emails. Then he wins the White House. The warmth isn\u2019t gone, but responsibility crowds it out. One time, he stops by for a friendly hello, and she blurts out her position on something. \u201cI saw his shoulders stiffen, and he said he had to get to another meeting,\u201d she laments. \u201cHe had the power to order officials in the government to take action on almost any issue in the world. This meant that when I raised a foreign policy topic with him, I wasn\u2019t launching an interesting discussion. Rather, I was making an implicit demand.\u201d Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.\n\nStill, Obama seems to want her around to needle him. He asks her to lunch so he can learn \u201cwhat ideals we have betrayed lately.\u201d When conservative pundits say that Power blasted Russia\u2019s 2014 Ukraine invasion more eloquently than Obama had, White House aides tell her to \u201cdial it back.\u201d She asks Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s top confidante, if that\u2019s really what the president wants. \u201cWhy the hell do you think I put Samantha up there?\u201d Obama tells him. \u201cShe is doing exactly what she should be doing.\u201d\n\nShe guards her integrity covetously. Power refuses to become \u201ca Washington a--hole\u201d by dodging questions at her ambassadorial confirmation hearing, exasperating the aide seeing her through the process. And in the book\u2019s most astonishing anecdote, she disobeys instructions from the White House to vote for Russia\u2019s accession to the U.N. Human Rights Council. (The United States and Russia always vote for each other to join various bodies, as an established \u201ccourtesy.\u201d) She can\u2019t bring herself to do it, so she picks Croatia instead, and that nation wins. For Power, who doesn\u2019t tell us how her administration colleagues reacted to this revolt, mutiny is not too high a price to pay for honor.\n\nPower writes with heart about her upbringing \u2014 in Ireland, Pittsburgh and Atlanta \u2014 and she is especially poignant when recounting a few traumatic episodes: the deaths of her alcoholic father and of Toussaint Birwe, a Cameroonian 6-year-old killed when a car in her convoy strikes him. Still, the book is suffused with humor, and the president furnishes the funniest anecdotes that don\u2019t come from her charming children. \u201cCass?! Cass Sunstein? He\u2019s a total slob,\u201d Obama exclaims when he learns of her new romantic interest. Then he thinks better of this outburst and offers that Sunstein is \u201cbrilliant, creative, and kind.\u201d After she and Sunstein move in together, they make a deal. Every time he leaves the apartment, \u201che has to carry at least one item with him to the dumpster (eg, argyle sweaters and \u2018Members Only\u2019 jackets, Red Sox season guides from the pre-steroids era, his prior tenant\u2019s water color paintings, 1993 University of Chicago environmental law exams . . .).\u201d\n\nMost matters that demand Power\u2019s moral clarity get it: She skewers the misogynistic metaphors of government (why must a country \u201cshow some leg\u201d to telegraph interest in a deal?), for instance, and regrets not heading off a Weinstein-like situation when the Bosnian prime minister greets the young reporter for a hotel-room interview wearing his bathrobe.\n\nA few issues, though, receive a more muddled treatment. Power notes that Obama decided not to publicly back Iran\u2019s Green Revolution, \u201cfearing that offering his vocal support would allow the Iranian government to caricature protesters as American-backed agents.\u201d We never learn what she thinks of his silence. She spends long passages recounting Obama\u2019s reasons for not doing more to help Syrian rebels or Libyan civilians after the fall of Moammar Gaddafi, even when it\u2019s clear she believes these are rationalizations. In a baffling choice, Power says nothing at all about the administration\u2019s favorite tactic for battling Islamist militants: targeted assassination.\n\nEven so, \u201cThe Education of an Idealist\u201d is a moving account of how to serve righteously, or at least how to try. It\u2019s true that Power never travels any kind of character arc; she does not meaningfully change, even as she accepts the exigencies necessary to govern \u2014 and that is to her credit. Her education is not about compromising her ideals for influence but about figuring out how to deploy them to move a bureaucracy.
