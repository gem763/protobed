Napolitano voiced that Trump had committed a \u201ccrime\u201d by pressuring Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to consider investigating former vice-president and current Democratic 2020 hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nJames Murdoch: 'There are views I really disagree with' on Fox News Read more\n\n\u201cIt is a crime for the president to solicit aid for his campaign from a foreign government,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cThis is the same crime for which the Trump Organization was investigated by Bob Mueller.\u201d\n\nThat evening, the vociferous conservative host Tucker Carlson called on his own judicial analyst, the former prosecutor Joseph diGenova, who duly called Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think Judge Napolitano is a fool and I think what he said today is foolish,\u201d DiGenova said.\n\n\u201cNo, it is not a crime. Let me underscore emphatically that nothing that the president said on that call or what we think he said on that call constitutes a crime.\u201d\n\nA day later, Smith was on air, calling Carlson \u201crepugnant\u201d for not backing up Napolitano.\n\nAccording to reports, Fox News\u2019 CEO, Suzanne Scott, and Jay Wallace, the channel\u2019s president, stepped in the quell the discord, directing Smith to cease his attacks on Carlson. \u201cThey said if he does it again, he\u2019s off the air,\u201d a source told Vanity Fair, though the development was denied by a Fox spokesperson.\n\nBut other disputes also broke out. Juan Williams, a host on the afternoon opinion roundtable show The Five, opined that Trump loyalists, including his colleagues at Fox News, appeared to be repeating the White House\u2019s talking points on the issue.\n\nThe Five\u2019s Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld bristled at the implication: \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Gutfeld yelled. \u201cAre you saying I got talking points?! You got to answer to the accusation!\u201d\n\nWatters added: \u201cAre you telling me I was told what to say?\u201d\n\nGutfeld went on to accuse Williams of taking his lines from the liberal-leaning watchdog Media Matters.\n\nAgainst falling polling numbers, the impact of the Ukrainian whistleblower drama reportedly caused Trump loyalist Sean Hannity to remark that the allegations are \u201creally bad\u201d for the president, while Fox Corporation\u2019s CEO, Lachlan Murdoch, is facing how to position the news channel toward an impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s management bedlam,\u201d a Fox staffer remarked, according to Vanity Fair report. \u201cThis massive thing happened, and no one knows how to cover it.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for Murdoch is how to position Fox News as defendant of conservative-thinking viewers in a post-Trump world \u2013 a path advocated by former House speaker Paul Ryan, who joined the Fox board earlier this year.\n\n\u201cFox is about defending our viewers from the people who hate them,\u201d the source told the magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s where our power comes from. It\u2019s not about Trump.\u201d\n\nThat logic may now be coming to the forefront. Over the past several months Fox News management has noted that following Trump\u2019s line has begun to cost the channel advertising revenue.\n\nAfter the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Carlson disputed that Trump ever \u201cendorsed white supremacy or came close to endorsing white supremacy\u201d and dismissed white supremacy as \u201cactually not a real problem in America\u201d.\n\nAccording to Media Matters, the number of paid ads supporting Carlson\u2019s show drastically plummeted. The host left on vacation \u2013 which Fox New flacks claimed was planned in advance \u2013 as advertisers, including Stein Mart, HelloFresh, and Nestl\u00e9 severed ties with Tucker Carlson Tonight, and the fast food chain Long John Silver\u2019s pulled its advertising from Fox News entirely.\n\nNearly 50 companies have issued statements dropping Carlson\u2019s show since December, when he asserted that immigrants make America \u201cpoorer and dirtier\u201d \u2013 and dozens more quietly cut ties without saying anything publicly.\n\nBloomberg News reported an overall decline in ad revenue for Fox, rejecting Fox claims that ad revenue is steady.", "description": "Channel sees chaos as hosts battle over how to approach political drama regarding the ratings valuable US president", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/635acee1502e4c37e812ad52d82afc023c8f914e/0_21_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e34b170a71d382eced1d655c43088cb2", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
