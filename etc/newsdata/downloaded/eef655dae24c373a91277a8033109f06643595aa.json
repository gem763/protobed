But after seeing one being worn by an actress, she began exploring bionic alternatives.\n\nThese days, New York-native Dayna sports a black 'robot arm' emblazoned with a Chanel logo, who she has named Tatiana, and she believes her 'ultimate fashion accessory' marks her apart.\n\nUnapologetic: Sex and relationships writer Dayna Troisi, pictured, doesn't care if people stare at her bionic arm as she is 'proud' of who she is an won't apologize for being different\n\nConfidence: The 26-year-old said she doesn't mind if people stare at her prosthetic arm, which she has nicknamed Tatiana, because she 'knows she looks good'\n\nDayna joked to Barcroft TV that her arm is 'a little slutty'.\n\n'She loves to have fun. She would definitely be doing tequila shots, that's her drink of choice,' she joked.\n\nThe writer is unapologetic about her limb difference and she hopes sharing her story will change people\u2019s perceptions around sex and disability.\n\nDayna said, 'You see a girl walking around with a legit Chanel robot arm obviously you\u2019re going to look. I don\u2019t care when people stare because I know I look good!'\n\nShe added, 'I love sexiness, I love femininity and I\u2019m so proud of myself that I\u2019m up to a point where I don\u2019t apologize for it. I\u2019m excited by it, to me this is like the ultimate fashion accessory.\u2019\n\nDayna, who has written about sex and disability for outlets such as Glamour and Marie Claire and is the Managing Editor of a prominent LGBTQ magazine said she also sees her arm as an outlet for humor.\n\nFunnywoman: The New Yorker wants people to know that disabilities don't have to be sad, challenging or inspiring, as she finds the humor in her disability\n\nIndependent: Growing up, Dayna did not use a prosthetic, and she said the most irritating thing was when people assumed she couldn't do activities\n\n'When I didn't wear a bionic arm, people would say, \"What happened your arm?\" and I would say, \"I got hungry,\"' she laughed.\n\n'I usually use it to prank people. My roommates would leave it in the shower or on people's beds and put my weave around it.'\n\nWriter: Dayna has written over 200 sex and dating articles and is the Managing Editor of a prominent LGBTQ magazine\n\nAlthough now a convivial twenty-something with a successful career in publishing, Dayna concedes her childhood was not without its challenges.\n\nShe said that one of the most difficult parts of growing up without an arm was people falsely expecting she was unable to participate in group activities.\n\n'One of the most challenging parts of growing up with one arm is when people would assume that I can't do things.\n\n'So whether it was me wanting to try a rock climbing wall at a school fair or take a dance class. When people assumed that I couldn\u2019t do things or needed help, that really hurt.'\n\n\u2018Sometimes I did need help and there are things that I\u2019m going to need to adjust to do.\n\n\u2018For sure it affected my self-esteem, but I also think the fact I was born this way didn\u2019t really give me a choice.\n\nDating: Dayna is active on the dating scene in New York and puts her bionic arm front and center in her app profiles, even including the tagline 'bionic b**ch' in her bio\n\nGrowing up: Dayna said she didn't opt to use a prosthetic until she was 23, after seeing an actress wearing a bionic arm\n\n'A lot of people would just come up and touch my arm or ask me about it, it was never malicious but it certainly did make me uncomfortable and embarrassed'.\n\nHowever, now it's a different scenario altogether.\n\n'Now it's like, \"Girl love your arm, you look like a robot!\" and I'm like, \"Yaasssss!\"'\n\nNarrative: Dayna, whose online dating profile is pictured, said she 'hopes to change the conversation around disability'\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m such an over achiever in my life, because I want to show that I can do things,' she added.\n\nDayna, who is gay, is sociable and actively dating, and her disability isn\u2019t something she intends to shy away from with prospective dates.\n\n\u2018On dating apps I\u2019m very open about the fact I have one arm. My bio says \"bionic b**ch\" and all my photos have my arm clearly visible,' she said.\n\n\u2018I want people to know what they\u2019re getting into and I\u2019m just open about it. I think it makes people feel very comfortable with me.\u2019\n\nAs a dating writer, Dayna proudly champions that disabilities shouldn\u2019t stop anyone from enjoying a healthy sex life.\n\nShe said, \u2018Even though some things might be a little different for you, everyone is still totally deserving of pleasure.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s something so kinky about being a fembot or cyborg!\n\n\u2018I just wish women would fetishize me the way men do. I would love it if a girl was like that\u2019s so f**king hot,' she tells her friends.\n\nFun loving: Dayna said she is proud of all the things that make her unique, like her bionic arm and being gay as they give her a 'story to tell'\n\nComfortable: As she is so self-assured, Dayna believes others are comfortable around her too when they first meet her\n\nDate night: Dayna preps for a date, left, and enjoys a night out with a woman she met on a dating app, right\n\nNight out: Dayna is seen on a date with Claire, who told Barcroft that she found Dayna 'funny and hot'\n\nDayna hopes to change the conversation around sex and disability with her unapologetic approach to honest and frank conversations.\n\n\u2018To grow up with only the narrative that you can overcome something or be an inspiration is really limiting and kinda un-sexy,\u2019 she said.\n\nMaking a statement: Dayna said her bionic arm is her 'ultimate fashion statement' and she matched the Chanel logo to her favorite handbag\n\n\u2018Opening those conversations to make able-bodied people less scared to be curious about having sex with disabled people.\u2019\n\nIn her personal life Dayna revels in her sexuality, femininity and sees her arm as a USP on the dating scene.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m never going to grow a limb so I might as well enjoy this and embrace it.\n\n\u2018All the things that I thought would make me stick out - being gay, being disabled, all the things that make me, me and give me a story to tell.\u2019\n\n'For the most part I really love myself. Unless I eat too much salt and my face is really bloated,' she adds with a smile.\n\n'In reality, I'm just like you [before a date], I'm worrying does my breath smell or do my boobs look OK?'\n\n'My disability can be funny, and a lot of things other than just challenging or inspiring. Like sometimes I get half price at the nail salon! There's lots of funny moments!'", "description": "Dayna Troisi is a sex and dating writer who is determined to prove that people with disabilities can still enjoy a healthy sex life.
