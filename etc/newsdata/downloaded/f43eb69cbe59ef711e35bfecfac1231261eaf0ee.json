You\u2019ve finally gone and done it. You\u2019ve throttled the supply of high-earning husbands, and now there are severe mismatches in the marriage market. Yes, I regret to report that a study in the Journal of Marriage and Family (there truly is a journal for everything) has found that unmarried American women \u201cface overall shortages of economically attractive partners\u201d. Women are looking for husbands with an income 58% higher than those of the available men.\n\nHang on, I thought marriage was about love, not combined incomes? Sure, says Daniel Lichter, a Cornell professor and the study\u2019s lead author, \u201cbut it also is fundamentally an economic transaction\u201d. And, Lichter says, \u201cMany young men today have little to bring to the marriage bargain, especially as young women\u2019s educational levels \u2026now exceed their male suitors.\u201d\n\nWhy do so many men have such poor prospects? There are various theories including, Lichter notes, the \u201cgig economy of unstable, low-paying service jobs\u201d. But you know what\u2019s easier than blaming the economy? Blaming women! The fact women are struggling to find suitable husbands has caused glee in conservative circles. US shock-jock Rush Limbaugh says this story shows feminism has come back to bite women \u201cin the butt\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re earning money, but they still have the same attitude about marriage,\u201d he crowed.\n\nI hate to say this, but Limbaugh does have a very tiny point. I\u2019m struck by how many empowered women regress to the 1950s when it comes to marriage. They fight for equality at work, but still have traditional expectations when it comes to men proposing with expensive diamond rings. And the idea that marrying a rich dude is something one should aspire to is still very much entrenched in society. The rise of \u201ceconomically unattractive\u201d men isn\u2019t just bad news for guys \u2013 it reflects poorly on us all.", "description": "Rush Limbaugh is wrong to blame feminists for the lack of \u2018high-earning husbands\u2019, but some women do have odd ideas about wedlock", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b133e16d39b789cdb353e60df283b26eb78e05/136_0_4028_2418/master/4028.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=967f72c54b98007dc2c3b44db46a4a63", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
