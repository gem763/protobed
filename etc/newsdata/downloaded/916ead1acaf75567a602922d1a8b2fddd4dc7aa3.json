So the only way we can push inflation up is by cutting rates.\"\n\nThe \"unspoken consideration,\" Mr Costello said, was that the RBA was motivated by competition as the central banks in the US, Europe and Japan cut their cash rates.\n\n\"I think what is driving this as much as anything else is the international position [of US and European central banks cutting interest rates] rather than domestic conditions.\n\n\"Now a central bank will never talk about exchange rates and it's not supposed to think about exchange rates. Exchange rates are supposed to be free-floating market instruments, so a central banker could never say 'I'm looking at exchange rates or I'm influenced by the exchange rate.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They'll always put it in another way,\" he said.\n\n\"They will say, 'I'm influenced by demand. I'm influenced by conditions.' But in the back of their mind, they're thinking exchange rates are quite a big part of it.\"\n\nHe said Australia was now in a situation \"where we'll have to maintain low rates, because of the competitive position around the world\".\n\nMr Costello said he was concerned that low interest rates had sent investors searching for yields in the stock and property markets, which had pushed up these asset prices.\n\n\"What happens when monetary policies go back to normal?\" he asked.\n\n\"Everyone says they'll get out in time.\n\n\"There could be a stampede for the exits because these asset prices are very high.\"", "description": "Former treasurer Peter Costello says the economy is \"objectively\" in good condition, dismissing calls for increased government spending and criticising the RBA's interest rate cuts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5582%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1662%2C$y_220/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c44766f5d5652a6881380c7b4c4303cdf9fbb092", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
