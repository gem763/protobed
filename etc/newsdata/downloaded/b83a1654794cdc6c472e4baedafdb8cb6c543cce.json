A couple who are lifelong fans of actor Jason Segel are still in shock over the fateful moment he passed by their engagement shoot and photobombed them\n\nWriting on The Twisted Oaks photography blog, lead photographer Eric Talerico said that the couple had no idea that Jason was in town for the filming of a new project.\n\n'He's been seen out and about quite a bit by Philly locals. Since Joe is in the Navy and stationed in Virginia, the two of them had no idea,' Eric wrote.\n\n'You don't ever expect to have someone like Jason walk by during your engagement shoot and decide to jump in for a quick photo.'\n\nMegan and Joe, a Navy officer, wanted to have photos taken around Philadelphia as the lovebirds had met as a CrossFit gym in the city.\n\nMegan told TODAY: 'We saw Jason Segel walk by at one point. We thought it may have been him, and someone else nearby confirmed that he had been filming a movie in the city and was seen out and about all summer.'\n\nA day to remember: Virginia-based Megan Monaco and Joe Feltrow wanted to have their pictures taken in Philadelphia, where they met, and were unaware that Jason was in town\n\nNerves: Photographer Eric Talerico said meeting their favorite movie star helped the couple relax and enjoy the shoot even more\n\nAs they were starstruck, they initially let the 6'4 actor walk by without saying anything.\n\nBut as luck would have it, Jason reappeared a mere half hour later near the Philadelphia Museum of Art where the couple were posing for pictures.\n\n'We were looking at him and caught his attention. He waved and came over,' Megan explained to the outlet.\n\n'When he did, he said, 'Keep doing what you're doing, I'll get in on a picture with you.\n\n'We just kept holding hands, doing the pose we were about to do anyway, and he got in the middle of us and made a very Jason Segel face. ... Jason congratulated us and he just went about the rest of his day.'\n\nFunnyman: Megan joked that the actor jokingly pulled a 'very Jason Segel face' as he is known to do in his movies, such as The Muppets, above\n\nComic: The Los Angeles-born star, known for his comedy roles, is often seen pulling hilarious faces\n\nPhotographer Eric added that it helped to ease the couple's nerves in front of the camera too.\n\n'After some shared laughs and recited movie lines, both Megan and Joe expressed to [Jason] how much they enjoyed the shoot and were actually able to connect with each other in a whole new way,' he wrote online.\n\n'At the end of the day, the photos captured were exactly what they were looking for to celebrate their engagement and remember this special time in their lives. Meeting Jason was a pretty nice bonus that helped make those memories that much more special,' he added.\n\nThe couple plan to get married in 2020 with 175 of their nearest and dearest already on the guest list. However, after their encounter with Jason, they are happy to add two more names to the seating charts.\n\n'If you talk to Jason, you can tell him he is more than welcome to come to our wedding,' Joe told TODAY.\n\n'This is an open invitation for sure. He can even have a plus-one,' Megan added.\n\nIronically, Jason could potentially offer more than just his presence as the Los Angeles-native is actually an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.\n\nHe'll do anything once! Jason, left, and TV host Jay Leno invited a couple on the show to be wed on air\n\nOrdained: Jason, left, was ordained by the Universal Life Church to carry out the hilarious yet legally-binding ceremony\n\nAccording to the New York Times, back in 2010, Hollywood-based couple Abbe Thorner and Jason Wood were due to be wed when their scheduled officiant canceled two weeks before the big day.\n\nJason Segel now pronounces you man and wife! Happy couple Abbe and Jason Wood enlisted the actor to marry them on TV in 2010\n\nKeen to find someone 'entertaining and funny' to step in, they recalled reading in an interview that Jason was 'up for anything'.\n\nThe couple placed 'wanted posters' with the actors face around bars he was known to frequent on Sunset Boulevard and even shared an ad on Craiglist asking, 'Jason Segel - will you marry us?'\n\nAbbe Thorner, now Abbe Wood, said that they were having a drink in the Den bar when Jason walked in with one of their fliers in his hand and declared he would do the honor.\n\nWhile he was busy promoting a movie on their scheduled wedding date, he said he would marry them on The Tonight Show instead - with host Jay Leno as their witness.\n\n'It was insane,' Abbe said said of the experience. 'We're nobodies! Let me tell you, my husband and I tried to plan a very low-key wedding and this is the extreme opposite. We wound up on national TV.'", "description": "Megan Monaco and\u00a0Joe Fetrow were having their engagement photos taken in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when their lifelong favorite actor Jason Segel happened to walk past and joined in", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/20143016-0-image-a-96_1571935047495.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
