Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u201cMy favorite \u2014 I\u2019m going to say it, we\u2019ll break news today \u2014 is Elizabeth Warren,\" Legend said. \"She\u2019s the best candidate running today and she comes at it with joy and with sincerity and with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Teigen added. \u201cI also love Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nLegend also told the magazine that, as he sees it, many men struggle to back Warren because of her gender.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t comprehend why guys hate women so much sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see someone as transparently competent and eloquent and on fire as Elizabeth Warren and then you hear some guys just are not into voting for a woman. Why do guys feel so threatened by the idea of a woman president?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur menses,\u201d Teigen continued, whispering into his ear. \u201cBecause there\u2019s 10 days a month where we\u2019re just going to war.\u201d\n\nWarren expressed her gratitude to the couple for their endorsement in a tweet later Monday.\n\nI'm grateful down to my toes for your support, @johnlegend! Looking forward to the day @chrissyteigen doesn't have to fight with the president of the United States on Twitter. https://t.co/bLdlaUcW4z \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 29, 2019\n\n\"I'm grateful down to my toes for your support, @johnlegend!\" the candidate wrote. \"Looking forward to the day @chrissyteigen doesn't have to fight with the president of the United States on Twitter.\"\n\nChrissy Teigen praises John Legend's sweet gesture: 'I haven\u2019t been feeling like myself lately'\n\nLegend and Teigen found themselves the target of President Donald Trump's twitter criticism in September after Legend was featured in Lester Holt's MSNBC \"Justice for All\" series, a report about the criminal justice system.\n\nThe report included an interview with Legend discussing his organization Free America, which aims to \"amplify the voices of individuals impacted by the criminal justice system and those who are working to change it,\" according to the official website.\n\nTrump complained when it aired that \"people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform... came to me as a group and asked for my help,\" but now he isn't getting any credit, seemingly referring to the First Step Act he signed into law in December, which allows prisoners to get more days removed from their sentences for good behavior.\n\nMeghan McCain defends Chrissy Teigen after President Trump targets Teigen, John Legend\n\n\"Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nChrissy Teigen's all-time best mom-shaming clapbacks and most hilarious cracks ever\n\nLegend responded: \"Imagine being president of a whole country and spending your Sunday night hate-watching MSNBC hoping somebody--ANYBODY--will praise you. Melania, please praise this man. He needs you.\n\n\"Your country needs you, Melania,\" he added, before retweeting a photo of the first lady smiling while leaning in to greet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G-7 summit that previously had the hashtag #MelaniaLovesTrudeau trending.\n\n\"Ah yes, Melania is otherwise occupied. My apologies, @realDonaldTrump,\" Legend wrote.\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff, USA TODAY.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: John Legend, Chrissy Teigen break silence on 2020 nominees", "description": "John Legend and Chrissy Teigen revealed who they want in the White House, with Legend adding he doesn't get \"why guys hate women so much sometimes.\"", "authors": ["Charles Trepany", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jveZ4WK2CewmmqPQuxN.Xg--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9MjY2NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_entertainment_893/cf6f38adc4513d47c6eaad0795debf21", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
