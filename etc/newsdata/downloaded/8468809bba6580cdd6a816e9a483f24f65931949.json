Some analysts suggest the ECB will start buying euro zone equities, not just government bonds, in a new wave of quantitative easing.\n\nThe euro was neutral against the dollar in early London trade at $1.1033. It slipped to $1.10155 overnight, its weakest since Sept. 4.\n\nHedge funds have added more short euro positions, taking the amount of contracts to $6.74 billion in the week to Sept. 3, the highest in a month, though positions were not as big as in April. EURNETUSD=\n\nThe , which tracks the U.S. currency against six other currencies , was flat at 98.438. The dollar was confined to a narrow range against the yen as traders weighed the prospect of U.S. rate cuts against their demand for safe-haven assets. Dollar/yen was last flat at 106.93 .\n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to act \"as appropriate\" to sustain the U.S. economic expansion, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday in Zurich, bolstering expectations for a rate cut at the Fed's meeting on Sept. 18. the Australian dollar, a proxy for risk, jumped to a five-week high of 0.68625 against the U.S. dollar AUD=D3 as traders became more optimistic that China would withstand the impact of trade disputes with the United States, after its central bank cut its reserve rate ratio.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar held onto gains, trading at 0.6419 against the U.S. dollar NZD=D3 , not far from the four-week high of 0.6444 it reached on Friday.\n\nSterling was down 0.4% at $1.2235 GBP=D3 as traders waited to see whether the British parliament would vote to hold an early general election before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. If a snap election were held and the Conservative Party won, it could scrap recent legislation to extend Britain's exit from the European Union for a third time. Against the euro, sterling was 0.5% lower at 90.13 EURGBP=D3 .\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/3181NHI\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "FOREX-Euro remains subdued before key ECB meeting this week", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA770AV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
