That's when incoming Chief Executive Officer David Solomon named Stephen Scherr as his chief financial officer, replacing Chavez in that role. He then became one of three securities division co-heads, an area which has suffered from an industry-wide slump in trading revenue.\n\nChavez joined Goldman in 1993 in the J. Aron commodities trading division, leaving after a few years to found a Silicon Valley start-up. He returned to Goldman in 2005 and served in a number of roles that blended his technology chops with trading and investment banking roles. He served as chief information officer from 2014 until 2017, when he was named chief financial officer.\n\n\"He has been a passionate advocate for engineers throughout the firm, redefining our clients' experience with software and data,\" Solomon said in the memo.\n\nFor years, Chavez has been outspoken on the need for the financial industry to become more like giant technology firms in its approach to coding and serving clients. He has also been a leading voice about efforts to replace people with automation in trading and other areas.\n\nDuring ex-CEO Lloyd Blankfein's long tenure, Chavez was often named among potential executives who could eventually lead the company. The move Tuesday was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMarc Nachmann will take his place in the securities division, according to a separate memo.", "description": "The move comes a year after Chavez's long ascent at Goldman appeared to stall.", "authors": ["Hugh Son"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105335360-1531848088872gettyimages-138744503.jpeg?v=1536854583"}
