It turns out there are eyes and ears everywhere. Claiming collusion won't get you any justice, but curves like these will get you sent down in history,' reads the costume's description, which ends with one last impeachment-related promise: 'No quid pro quo required.'\n\nFor those who'd rather touch upon Trump's policies, Yandy is also offering a 'Sexy Tariff' costume that mocks the president's ongoing trade dispute with China.\n\nRetailing for $59.95, the scantily-clad look features a sleeveless dress with a money print that has 'Tariff' printed in red at the bust and a black 'Import' stamp on the back.\n\n'A distant trade war is upon us! Will you resist it? Show off your assets and be the hottest import in town,' reads the cheeky description. 'Made in USA. (Price is subject to change.)'\n\nGet it? The lingerie company is also offering a 'Sexy Tariff' costume that pokes fun at the president's ongoing trade dispute with China\n\nDetails: The scantily-clad look features a sleeveless dress with a money print that has 'Tariff' printed in red at the bust and a black 'Import' stamp on the back\n\nWhether or not he knows it, Trump has influenced plenty of 'sexy' Yandy costumes over the years.\n\nIn 2015, the company rolled out a 'Donna T. Rumpshaker' costume \u2014 a sexy take on Trump's navy suit and MAGA hat that is still available four years later.\n\nAnd ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Yandy released a 'Sexy Undecided Voter' costume inspired by Ken Bone, an undecided voter from Illinois who became a breakout star after a debate.\n\nThis year has given the company a breadth of new material, including the college admissions scandal that has actress Felicity Huffman Lori Loughlin looking at jail time.\n\nYandy's sexy 'College Scandal' costume, which costs $69.95, comes with an orange long-sleeved crop top with 'Inmate' written in black across the front and 'Mom of the Year' printed in white and crossed out.\n\nKeeping current: Yandy is selling a $69.95 'College Scandal' inspired by the college admissions scandal plaguing prominent celebrities and other wealthy parents\n\nSexy twist: The costume is designed like an orange prison uniform with 'Inmate' written across the chest in black\n\nThe crop top is paired with matching orange leggings with 'YC 024' written on the side of one leg.\n\n'Oops, you can't always trust those motherly instincts. Turns out fame and intelligence don't go hand in hand! Bribe your way to the admissions office and score the ultimate scholarly achievement (the best mom award!) in this exclusive College Scandal costume,' reads the description. Can't row your way out of this one.'\n\nThe rowing jab is an obvious reference to Loughlin allegedly paying $500,000 to get her two daughters into the University of Southern California as rowing recruits.\n\nLoughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them, but they could face up to 40 years in prison.\n\nHuffman, on the other hand, was given a 14-day prison sentence for charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud after she paid $15,000 for someone to boost her daughter's SAT score.", "description": "Yandy, a brand best known for its ripped-from-the-headlines costumes with a sexy twist,\u00a0has gotten political with this year's 'Miss Impeachment' ensemble.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608656-0-image-a-95_1570828677626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
