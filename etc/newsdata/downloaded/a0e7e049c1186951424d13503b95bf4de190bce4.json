Before leaving, he agreed to take questions from some English reporters, including Sportsmail. This was his honest reply.\n\nBulgaria captain Ivelin Popov spoke to Sportsmail in the wake of his country's fans racist abuse\n\nIt was important that I spoke with them at half-time because it is a very big problem for everybody - for our federation, for England and if they [the fans] said more bad words - even one more time - then maybe they would finish the game.\n\nWe would have such a big punishment and this is no good for Bulgarian football because if some other players want to come here (to sign for clubs), they hear what is said and how they speak bad. This is no good for everybody.\n\nDid the England players ask me to do it? No. We are 11 vs 11 - your colour does not matter. It's no problem. We are all the same. We are one very big family in football, everybody and only we - if we are together - can stop these bad things.\n\nAt half-time Popov pleaded with Bulgarian fans to stop racially abusing England's black players\n\nBulgaria captain Ivelin Popov had a heated discussion with some Bulgarian fans during the break of tonight's #BULENG qualifier after the match had been stopped twice for racist chants in the first half pic.twitter.com/8u0a1CGcoa \u2014 mshumanov (@shumansko) October 14, 2019\n\nSupporters could be seen making offensive gestures and also made monkey chants\n\nThe fans were angry with me? This is normal. The first half was 4-0. They were very angry and were saying to me: 'don't speak to us!'\n\nBut when you start to speak to them, afterwards they understand. I think in the second half (the atmosphere) was better.\n\nI don't want it to be like this (at games in Bulgaria). It's not good for us. It is not good for federation and our country. How do I feel? I don't feel good as we didn't play well, we lost 6-0 and also this (racism) what happened was terrible.\n\nIt must stop. In this country, we have a team like Ludogrets, who have players from every country. I never (heard) this sort of problem in the Bulgarian championship. I don't know why they made like this (now) because many fans are fans and supporters of English football.\n\nThere are fan clubs from Chelsea; from Liverpool and Manchester. It's incredible and I don't know why they made this. For me, it's incredible - a surprise. In every big city, they have fan clubs. In Sofia, they have several fan clubs for every big club.\n\nEngland are one of the top teams, very good team, I see how the coach in training makes good combinations, it's difficult to play against a team like this, it's only good if we play with heart and more running and more discipline and we didn't make that. Of course I feel embarrassed.\n\nBulgarian fans with hoods and face masks, some of them with 'hooligans' printed on their shirts, head for the exits after the second stoppage in the first half on Monday evening\n\nAs told to Dominic King.", "description": "IVELIN POPOV - BULGARIA CAPTAIN: It was important that I spoke with them [the supporters] at half-time because it is a very big problem for everybody.", "authors": ["Ivelin Popov For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/21/19712408-0-image-a-9_1571170928394.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
