There are a few circumstantial clues.\n\nFirstly, the Ukrainian readout of the call refers to Mr Trump being \"convinced\" that the new government will \"complete (the) investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA\".\n\nIs that a diplomatic reference to the US president asking for a probe into Mr Biden?\n\nThere's then the question as to why President Trump has kept Ukraine's new leader at arms' length since his election in April.\n\nSome $250m in US military assistance for Ukraine was mysteriously held up by the White House this summer, and a long-mooted visit for President Zelensky to Washington has still not materialised.\n\nIs Ukraine's leader being punished for refusing to play ball?\n\nHow have Trump and Giuliani responded?\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he knew all his phone calls to foreign leaders were listened to by US agencies.\n\n\"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader,\" he asked.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Another Fake News story out there - It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2019 Report\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Giuliani gave an interview to CNN where he both confirmed, and denied, that he had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nHe explained the contradiction by saying that he had asked Ukraine \"to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme\".\n\nMr Trump and his fellow Republicans have questioned whether it represented a conflict of interest that Hunter Biden had served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nIn May, Ukraine's prosecutor general said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nWhy hasn't the whistleblower's complaint been shared?\n\nThere is a disagreement between the acting director of national intelligence (DNI), Joseph Macguire, and Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who is responsible for conducting independent audits and investigations across the intelligence community.\n\nA lawyer for Mr Macguire's office said in a letter to lawmakers that the complaint \"does not meet the definition of urgent concern\".\n\nThe complaint \"concerned conduct by someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to any 'intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision\", the letter said.\n\nIt also involved \"potentially privileged matters\", the letter added.\n\nMr Atkinson told lawmakers in a letter that he disagreed with the DNI's assessment, and believed the complaint \"relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI's responsibilities to the American people\".\n\nHowever, Mr Atkinson added that he was bound by the acting director of national intelligence's decision.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "Reports say the complaint relates to a July call with Ukraine's new president Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/317B/production/_108876621_gettyimages-1169369082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
