Arthur\u2019s mutton chops \u2014 in the end, given th iencreasingly limited time given to teaching American history, perhaps the most memorable thing about him.\n\nBut our presidents and other historic figures deserve better than that, and John M. Pafford, professor emeritus of history and philosophy at Northwood University in Midland, Michigan, and author of a respected biography of his fellow Michigander and friend Russell Kirk, has set out to do something about it.\n\nAmong his studies are \u201cJohn Jay: Forgotten Founder,\u201d several books analyzing the contributions of early American historic figures and most recently \u201cCleveland: The Forgotten Conservative,\u201d a study of Grover Cleveland, another under-appreciated president and President Arthur\u2019s successor in office.\n\nChester A. Arthur, our 21st president, neither sought the office nor wanted it. A career machine political bureaucrat personifying the spoils system, he was chosen in 1880 to run as James A. Garfield\u2019s vice president to unify a factionalized Republican Party. With the assassination of President Garfield, Arthur assumed the presidency, served out his term, didn\u2019t try for a second term, went into a quiet retirement, and died of complications from Bright\u2019s disease shortly thereafter.\n\nA New York lawyer, Arthur, originally a Whig who became an active Republican, joined the New York state militia, served until 1862, then was promoted to quartermaster general, serving in that capacity through the Civil War. From 1871 to 1878, he was appointed collector of the Port of New York by President Grant, a politically powerful and rewarding post.\n\nIn that post he became a force in Republican politics and in New York Sen. Roscoe Conkling\u2019s patronage machine. Thus, when he unexpectedly became president, his administration was widely expected to be routinely corrupt.\n\nBut as John Pafford shows us, a president who owed his career, and ultimately his presidency, to the patronage system \u2014 the very personification of that system \u2014 rose to an unexpected level of principle by supporting the reform of the corrupt civil service system, supporting and then signing the Pendleton Civil Service Act. By so doing, as Mr. Pafford points out, by taking an anti-patronage position, he guaranteed that he would lose party support for a second term.\n\nIn all, his administration was remarkably free of blunders and missteps, both in domestic and foreign policy, and surprisingly untouched by scandal in an age of scandal. In fact, the Arthur administration can take credit for a set of accomplishments that would have positive effects on the composition of our system of governance and, ultimately, our place in the world.\n\nAmong those accomplishments was the rebuilding and revitalization of our Navy at precisely that moment in history when it was required to buttress and facilitate our rapidly growing role as a potential major world power.\n\n\u201cThe case can be made,\u201d writes Mr. Pafford, \u201cthat the 1880s were the most productive decade in American history [with] impressive gains in gross national product, business formation, manufacturing, and agricultural productivity. Real income for both industrial and agricultural workers rose. Arthur does not deserve all the credit, of course, but this astonishing progress did get underway during his presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll things considered, Arthur deserves to be reexamined and remembered with respect and appreciation for his role in pulling the country together after the Garfield assassination in spite of severe, even terminal health problems and strong opposition within his own party. In March 1885 he turned over to Grover Cleveland a country which had rebounded well from the dark summer of 1881.\u201d\n\nMr. Pafford has a point. Perhaps, in addition to the established rating systems we use to evaluate presidents, a new set of criteria is in order \u2014 presidents who do no harm, ignite no blazing controversies, do some measurable good, comport themselves with restraint and dignity, and leave office quietly, with the nation a little better for their stewardship, may deserve unique consideration.\n\nIf such a category were adopted, President Chester Arthur, as portrayed by John Pafford, would rank near the top, mutton chops or not.\n\n\u2022 John R. Coyne Jr., a former White House speechwriter, is co-author of \u201cStrictly Right: William F. Buckley Jr. and the American Conservative Movement\u201d (Wiley).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL PRESIDENT: CHESTER A. ARTHUR\n\nBy John M.
