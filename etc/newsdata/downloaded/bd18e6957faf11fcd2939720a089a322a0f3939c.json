That gives them the majority on the committee, which consists of five Federal Reserve board governors, the New York Fed president, and a rotating group of four of the remaining eleven regional reserve bank presidents.\n\nThere is some talk that the differences of opinion may lead the Fed to pause after next week\u2019s meeting and take a \u201dwait and see\u201d stance before any further rate cuts.\n\nEconomists also think three rate cuts in a row meets the historical definition for \u201ca mid-cycle adjustment\u201d referenced by Powell when the Fed cut rates for the first time in a decade earlier this year.\n\nRead: Meet the lonely economist who thinks the Fed might just leave interest rates unchanged\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what economists and investors will be watching for when the Fed concludes the two-day meeting in Washington next week:\n\nWhat will the Fed\u2019s statement and press conference signal ?\n\n\u201cThe real question is what, if anything, will the FOMC signal,\u201d said Roberto Perli, an analyst with Cornerstone Macro. Perli thinks the Fed might signal the bar for additional rate cuts is getting higher.\n\nBack in 1998, the Fed statement was blunt after it cut rates three times in a row, saying the easing of financial conditions at that time should sustain economic growth with low inflation.\n\nBut Perli said he didn\u2019t think the Fed would mimic the 1998 language because policy makers are not as sure as they were then about what will happen next.\n\nHe said the Fed would send a more \u201csubtle\u201d message, adding language it was still prepared to ease \u201cif necessary.\u201d\n\nDerek Holt, head of capital markets economics for Scotiabank in Toronto, said the Fed will keep the guidance similar to its message since the summer: the Fed is not on a preset course and will \u201cact as appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Fed has realized they can\u2019t commit to be patient, given the zigs and zags of President Trump\u2019s international trade policy, Holt said. \u201cThey want to keep their cards close to the chest,\u201d he added.\n\nAvery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets, thinks some type of pause language will be necessary to get officials to vote for a rate cut. \u201cThe doubters will want some wording to suggest a pause is now in order,\u201d Shenfeld said.\n\nIf the Fed doesn\u2019t send any signal and leaves the statement virtually unchanged, the market will likely infer that the odds that another cut is coming in short order are a lot higher that presently thought and cause a rise in stocks SPX, +0.41% and bond prices , Perli of Cornerstone Macro added.\n\nHowever, if the central bank sends a signal the bar for further rate cuts is getting higher, this would be moderately hawkish, he said. Any hint of \u201cpatience\u201d would likely strengthen the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.00%, said Oscar Munoz, U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities.\n\nJames Sweeney, chief economist for Credit Suisse, said he didn\u2019t think Fed chair Powell would signal the end of this cycle of rate cuts. \u201cWe do not expect the Fed to push back yet against market pricing for some additional easing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe market now places low probability of a further rate cut in December, and investors are not pricing another policy easing until the March meeting.\n\nHow many dissenters ?\n\nIf the Fed eases by a quarter-point, there might be as many as three dissents in favor of standing pat. Three dissents at a FOMC meeting is rare and would signal the limits of further rate cuts in the near term.\n\nEconomists are divided over whether Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, will go along with the rate cut or dissent with Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George.\n\nDiane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, thinks Evans will dissent, but economists think Evans will support the easing move.\n\nShort-term repo market and balance sheet:\n\nMarket volatility in the short term money market drove the Fed to ramp up the size of its balance sheet and inject temporary liquidity in the past month. Economists are watching to see how the Fed addresses the topic next week. In an unannounced meeting earlier this month, the Fed extended repo operations into early next year and said it would begin to buy $60 billion of Treasury bills a month into next year. On Thursday this week the Fed increased the size of its daily and term offerings of liquidity.\n\nSee: Fed says it will start to buy Treasury bills next week to ease money-market pressure\n\nFed watchers are hoping the Fed will provide more clarity about the need for a standing repo facility and how large a balance sheet the Fed now envisions.\n\n\u201cThese short-term funding pressures will be with us for quite a while,\u201d Holt of Scotiabank said.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.45% has risen about 25 basis points since early October and is now at 1.768%. The yield is still down about 1.5 percentage points from its 52-week high of 3.232% though.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury yield curve is no longer inverted either. Still, recession models using the spread between the 10-year and the 3-month T-bills suggests the odds of a recession in the coming 12 months are as high as 25%, Ashworth of Capital Economics said.", "description": "Here are three things to watch when next week\u2019s Federal Reserve interest-rate meeting ends Wednesday.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT863_Powell_ZG_20191023113850.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
