And from the way that Doria Ragland\u2019s face lit up, she suddenly felt safe, no longer lonely in St George\u2019s Chapel.\n\nThe hand that grasped hers was that of the Prince of Wales. They were going through to the chantry to sign the marriage register.\n\nFor a moment, as the group moved towards the door, it was clear Meghan\u2019s mother, the only member of the bride\u2019s family in the chapel, had been momentarily uncertain. She shuffled in her seat.\n\nDoria had faced the massed ranks of the royal family across the quire with a quiet dignity. Her poise and her calm were a model of control in utterly strange and difficult circumstances.\n\nPrince Charles and Doria Ragland, mother of the bride, during the wedding ceremony of Harry and Meghan Markle at St George's Chapel in Windsor as Archbishop Welby looks on\n\nYou can certainly see where Meghan gets her star quality from. And yet Doria\u2019s loneliness on the bride\u2019s side was brutally obvious.\n\nAnd there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.\n\nNo face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.\n\nFor her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave. Quickly, Doria controlled her emotions. Not easy for her. Indeed, nothing was easy for her last week.\n\nAs she flew alone to Heathrow on an 11-hour flight from Los Angeles on Wednesday, family discord threatened to overshadow her daughter\u2019s big day. Although, of course, it was her ex-husband\u2019s side of the family and did not directly affect her.\n\nMeghan\u2019s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan\u2019s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.\n\nWith Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.\n\nWith the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.\n\nCharles and Doria pictured in St George's Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan Markle\n\nAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.\n\nAt 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan\u2019s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.\n\nDoria\u2019s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn\u2019t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.\n\nIt was on the set of ABC\u2019s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show\u2019s lighting director Tom Markle, a divorced man with two children, and married him.\n\nMeghan was their only child before they in turn divorced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.\n\nThe truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen\u2019s grandson.\n\nNever an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter\u2019s happiness.\n\nDoria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapel\n\nThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn\u2019t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.\n\nTraditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne\u2019s first husband, complained that she and her husband were \u2018virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace\u2019.\n\nThat attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.\n\nEven before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.\n\nWilliam has insisted they are included in royal gatherings \u2013 they\u2019ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.\n\nHarry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan\u2019s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.\n\nFor now, at least, Meghan\u2019s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.\n\nBut judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she\u2019ll certainly be able to handle it.", "description": "Two people\u2019s hands reaching for the other, and a warm smile.
