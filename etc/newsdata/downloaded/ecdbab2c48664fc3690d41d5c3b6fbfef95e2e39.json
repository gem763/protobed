Will it be structured and cleanly tailored, as was the trend on the fall runways earlier this year? Or will it be looser, more casually cut? Will it be printed or colorful? The answer may be unsatisfying, but it is also liberating: a power suit is now whatever you want it to be. Women don\u2019t need to be hemmed in\u2014and they especially don\u2019t need to adhere to the classic menswear-inspired silhouettes.

And shorts can sub for a pair of crisp pants.\n\nThese were among the coolest alternative suiting looks that wandered the streets of Manhattan during New York Fashion Week.
