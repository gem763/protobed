The hold on aid came amid Ukraine\u2019s struggle to fend off Russian aggression in Crimea and despite authorization from Congress and the Defense Department to allocate the funds.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget office, instead, blocked the aid in late July \u2014 news first revealed by POLITICO on August 29. The administration lifted the hold on the aid on Sept. 11 as bipartisan scrutiny of the decision mounted.\n\nDemocrats were largely tight-lipped emerging from Cooper\u2019s deposition. However, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a conservative ally of the president, said elements of her testimony conflicted with that of William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine who testified a day earlier. His testimony provided the first direct link between Trump and an effort to tie the military aid to politically motivated investigations. Meadows declined to detail the purported discrepancies.\n\nCooper\u2019s testimony comes despite the Pentagon blowing off a deadline last week to comply with a subpoena for documents related to the episode.\n\nCooper was also the first Defense Department witness to defy a directive not to testify, a sign that Trump\u2019s blockade of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry has continued to erode. Several senior State Department officials and a former National Security Council official have already taken the same route.\n\nOn Wednesday, three defense officials indicated they were collecting and reviewing documents in response to the House subpoena but were sending them to the White House, rather than Congress, to screen for potential privileged materials.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

But \u201cwe don\u2019t own a lot of the documents that are particularly of interest here.\u201d\n\nAside from Cooper, no other Pentagon officials have been subpoenaed, the officials added.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cd/9f/2933f9fb422ab494b1563ac543ee/191023-laura-cooper-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
