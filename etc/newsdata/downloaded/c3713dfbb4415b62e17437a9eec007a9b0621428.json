The diversion was a precautionary decision, Ulrike Gendrot-Haubold, an Air France spokesperson, told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nThe flight landed at Shannon Airport in Ireland, where the phone was given to authorities. The airport's fire and police service were available as a precaution, according to airport spokesperson Nandi O'Sullivan.\n\nThe flight later proceeded to Chicago and landed there at 8:26 p.m.\n\n\"Air France states that all customers and crew members are subject to a security screening inspection before being allowed to board a flight and that flight safety is its main priority,\" Gendrot-Haubold added in the statement.\n\nA flight diversion is not the same thing as an emergency landing \u2013 though they are often mixed up.\n\nA diversion to land at an alternate airport is often erroneously described as an emergency landing; there is no emergency, but there is a change in plans.\n\nFlight diversions aren't uncommon: A Southwest Airlines flight from Dallas to Los Angeles changed its course for Tucson International Airport in Arizona earlier this month after police were needed for an \"onboard issue,\" an airline spokesperson said.\n\nDavid Broseh, 51, was supposed to travel to Los Angeles. But after assaulting passengers on the plane because he was intoxicated, police said, he ended up in Tucson where he was met by airport police and escorted to Pima County jail, reports The Arizona Republic, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nContributing: John Cox, for USA TODAY; Gabriella Khalaj, Arizona Republic\n\nRemember?:Air France-KLM offering free flights to those helping rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral\n\nAsk the Captain:The difference between a diversion and an emergency", "description": "An Air France flight\u00a0from Paris to Chicago diverted in Ireland after a cell phone was discovered on board that didn't belong to any passengers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/08/05/USAT/daafc46f-7221-402f-b702-2680bf80c7a6-2019_USAT_AUGST-15.jpg?crop=1299,731,x1,y92&width=1096&height=731&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
