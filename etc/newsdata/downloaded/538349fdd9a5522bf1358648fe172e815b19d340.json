Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have signaled their willingness to banish the practice\u2014which involves pumping a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into rock formations deep below the earth\u2019s surface to release reserves of oil and gas\u2014and others have said they would work to phase it out.\n\nThe electorate is split on the issue. Nearly 45% of registered voters support the elimination of fracking for oil and gas production. The number jumps to 58% among Democratic primary voters, however, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday.\n\nU.S. shale oil accounts for most of America\u2019s oil production, which is now the largest in the world and has helped mitigate the effects of last week\u2019s disruption in Saudi output. Energy experts say cutting off a significant portion of U.S. shale-oil supply could have profound economic effects in the U.S., including in states like Pennsylvania that are likely to be key battlegrounds in the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cJust the messaging is giving investors and companies heartburn,\u201d said Katie Bays, co-founder of Sandhill Strategy, which advises companies on energy policy.\n\nEnvironmental activists hope a ban on fracking would reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels, which some Democrats would like to phase out as part of a Green New Deal effort to fight climate change. Many opponents of fracking also have concerns about the potential for chemicals used in the process to seep into the ground and water supplies.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s proposal envisions 100% reliance on renewable energy by 2030, fueled by a $16.3 trillion stimulus, of which $1.3 trillion would be used to ensure what it calls a \u201cjust transition for energy workers.\u201d A Sanders aide said the core of his energy plan was \u201ceconomic stimulus and spending to not only preserve communities that are based on fossil fuels, but to grow them and ensure fossil fuel workers come out even or ahead.\u201d\n\nSeveral other candidates have proposed less abrupt approaches to fracking. Former Vice President Joe Biden has called for blocking new drilling on federal lands. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has said he would phase out fracking.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Where do you stand on fracking? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nUsing fracking and other techniques, shale companies have led a resurgence of American oil production. They now produce more than 8 million barrels of oil a day, or roughly 10% of global supply. The U.S. pumps more than 12 million barrels a day in total, when accounting for other sources of production.\n\nA crackdown on fracking would be felt particularly keenly in Pennsylvania, which is now the second-biggest oil producer after Texas.\n\nRoughly half of Pennsylvania\u2019s counties have fracking activity. Those with some of the greatest concentration of wells\u2014in the southwest and northeast corners of the state\u2014were areas that strongly backed President Trump in the 2016 election, when he carried the state by only about 44,000 votes out of 6.1 million cast.\n\n\u201cIn the last three decades, we\u2019ve been writing obituaries for manufacturing. And in the last four or five years, we\u2019ve been writing birth announcements up and down the Appalachian Basin because of our newfound supplies of energy,\u201d said David Spigelmyer, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, which represents most of the natural-gas producers in the state.\n\nDemocrats who are pledging to abolish fracking don\u2019t specify how they would carry it out, given that the majority of shale production occurs on private lands, where the federal government doesn\u2019t have permitting authority. But even a ban on fracking new wells could shut down nearly all shale production in about a decade, Ms. Bays of Sandhill Strategy said.\n\nThat is because shale wells produce vast amounts of oil early on but decline rapidly, requiring companies to continually frack new wells to sustain production levels. Shale wells often dry up in 12 years or less. That could mean more than two-thirds of U.S. oil production would stop by 2035.\n\nShale production has helped to lower prices over the last decade, forcing producers like Saudi Arabia to pump less. The U.S. benchmark oil price has remained below $60 a barrel for much of 2019, down from more than $100 five years ago. Eliminating current shale production would send global oil prices up by more than $40, according to Kevin Book, head of research at ClearView Energy Partners LLC.\n\nA Citigroup research report earlier this month said that cutting all fossil-fuel production within 10 years, as some Democrats have urged, would lead to a two-year recession and the withdrawal of $270 billion in private-business investment over that period.\n\nIt also would have the intended effect of dramatically decreasing carbon emissions, Citigroup found. In one scenario, carbon-dioxide emissions would be reduced by a third by 2030 and cut in half by 2040.\n\n\u2014Kris Maher and John McCormick contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Christopher M.
