The indictment from the prosecutors in Braunschweig \u2014 in Volkswagen's home region of Lower Saxony \u2014 is part of a separate legal push to try managers over allegations they delayed disclosing the scandal to investors.\n\nLawyers for the three accused said they would contest the charges, while Volkswagen said its supervisory board would meet immediately to discuss the indictments which, if accepted by a Braunschweig state court, will lead to a trial date being set.\n\nIn September 2015, Volkswagen was found using software in certain diesel vehicles that made it appear as though the cars were producing fewer emissions than they really were. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nDiess's lawyer said the indictment would not hinder him in his role as CEO, adding that as Diess did not join Volkswagen until July 2015 he could not have foreseen the scandal would have such a huge impact on the company.\n\nVolkswagen shares lost up to 37 per cent in value in the days after the scandal broke. Had investors known about the emissions test cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, plaintiffs have argued.\n\nVolkswagen and its executives have said the fallout from the scandal was not foreseeable, and that they had expected to reach a settlement with U.S. authorities prior to the disclosure of the test cheating.\n\nThe Braunschweig prosecutors said the accused should have kept investors informed.\n\n\"They pursued a strategy to achieve a settlement with the U.S. authorities without disclosing all relevant information,\" they said in a statement.\n\nWinterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke, having been chief executive for eight years He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than VW had officially admitted.\n\nPoetsch became a management board member at Volkswagen in 2004 and was made chairman in 2015.", "description": "German prosecutors have brought criminal charges of stock market manipulation against Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, former CEO Martin Winterkorn and chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch in connection with the carmaker's emissions cheating scandal.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295094.1569334031!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/vw-ceo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
