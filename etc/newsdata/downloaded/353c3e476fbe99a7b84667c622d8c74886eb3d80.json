(Nasdaq: IMV; TSX: IMV), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a novel class of immunotherapies, today announced the appointment of Joanne Schindler, M.D., D.V.M. as its new Chief Medical Officer, effective November 4, 2019. Dr. Schindler will succeed Gabriela Rosu, M.D., who is leaving the company to pursue other opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to welcome Dr. Joanne Schindler, who brings a wealth of experience in oncology-focused drug development and clinical trial execution to IMV,\u201d said Fred Ors, Chief Executive Officer of IMV. \u201cOver the last few years, our clinical efforts have sought to leverage the potential of our DPX technology to deliver a novel class of immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with hard-to-treat cancers. We expect to benefit greatly from Joanne\u2019s leadership as we near key proof-of-concept readouts from our lead program and as we continue to explore the breadth of our platform across other targets of interest.\u201d\n\nMr. Ors continued, \u201cWe also want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Gabriela Rosu for her many contributions to IMV\u2019s clinical program and wish her the best in her future pursuits.\u201d\n\nDr. Schindler brings over 15 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, primarily in early-stage oncology drug development. Most recently, she served as Vice President, Clinical Development and Executive Medical Director at H3 Biomedicine, overseeing the company\u2019s clinical development efforts. Previously, she worked as Vice President, Clinical Development at Constellation Pharmaceuticals, and earlier held various clinical development leadership roles at SynDevRx, ImmunoGen, Novartis, Fresenius Biotech and GlycoGenesys. Over the course of her career, Dr. Schindler has played an instrumental role in advancing novel programs into the clinic, as well as the development and execution of clinical strategy. She holds an M.D. from the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, a D.V.M. from Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and a B.A. in biology from Brandeis University.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to join IMV at this critical stage in the company\u2019s growth,\u201d said Dr. Schindler. \u201cImmunotherapy is at the forefront of novel treatments for cancer and I have been deeply impressed with IMV\u2019s sophisticated science and data produced to date. Targeted T-cells born out of IMV\u2019s DPX platform have exhibited the potential to elicit a more rapid, robust and sustained immune response over other therapies, particularly when paired with a highly prevalent tumor-associated target like survivin. I look forward to working with the team to advance its clinical portfolio, to unlock the promise of this technology and to bring these important benefits to cancer patients in need.\u201d\n\nAbout IMV\n\nIMV Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to making immunotherapy more effective, more broadly applicable, and more widely available to people facing cancer and other serious diseases.
