This year\u2019s Emmy voters seemed to agree, handing the word-of-mouth hit an unexpected six Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series.\n\nFrom the singular vision of creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge \u2014 who, yes, rocks that jumpsuit \u2014 it\u2019s wickedly funny one minute and unspeakably sad the next. Its titular character\u2019s fourth-wall breaks have become iconic. And there\u2019s enormous beauty in the show\u2019s humanity, with its characters forming a tapestry of broken people (including, of course, the Hot Priest).\n\nFor those of us desperately seeking to fill the \u201cFleabag\u201d-sized hole in our hearts, a pair of new shows replicates the feeling of \u201cFleabag,\u201d to some degree, and builds on its themes: \u201cThis Way Up,\u201d currently streaming on Hulu, and \u201cBack to Life,\u201d premiering Nov. 10 on Showtime.\n\nPerhaps inevitably, both series have been compared to \u201cFleabag\u201d because of their surface-level similarities: they\u2019re also quirky dramedies, imported from the U.K., created by and starring women who use acerbic wit to deflect from trauma.\n\nMore crucially, they share a deeper thematic connection in the ways they refreshingly reject neat and tidy resolutions for their protagonists. These shows are not about \u201covercoming\u201d trauma and reaching \u201cclosure\u201d \u2014 but rather, living with it, as so many people do every day. There\u2019s a lot of comfort in seeing their protagonists just try to live their lives and work toward loving themselves, as difficult as that may be.\n\nHulu Aisling Bea in \"This Way Up.\"\n\nCreated by and starring Irish actress and comedian Aisling Bea, \u201cThis Way Up\u201d opens with protagonist Aine leaving what\u2019s described as a rehab facility, after experiencing a nervous breakdown several months earlier.\n\nWhen picking up Aine to take her home, her successful and driven older sister Shona (Sharon Horgan) mistakenly seems to think of it as closure.\n\n\u201cSo do we go, or do you do a bit of a speech? What happens next?\u201d she asks one of the facility\u2019s administrators. \u201cIs she, um, is she fixed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe try and get them back to a place where they can care about themselves enough to take care of themselves,\u201d the administrator responds.\n\nAine\u2019s road to caring about herself is rocky. While she is outwardly jovial and enthusiastic, she initially doesn\u2019t have any good friends, other than Shona, who has a busy job in finance and a long-term partner. Aine struggles with loneliness, showing how it can be hard to get through life when it seems like no one else is going through similar struggles, and everyone around you seems so put together.\n\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she asks Shona, when Shona needs her to leave in order to work on a project with a colleague.\n\n\u201cAine, I\u2019m not your event and life planner, OK?\u201d Shona says. \u201cJust figure it out. It\u2019s Saturday. Go do something fun.\u201d\n\nAine ends up spending the day mostly alone, going to an unhelpful psychic \u2014 to whom she asks: \u201cAnyone coming along who thinks I\u2019m not totally shite?\u201d \u2014 before sitting in a coffee shop until the owner kicks her out because it\u2019s closing time. She later goes on a comically bad date.\n\nIn another scene, an acquaintance cancels plans to meet up on a Friday night. Aine is too embarrassed to tell Shona she\u2019s staying in, falsely claiming she\u2019s planning to meet up with friends later. When Shona leaves for her own evening plans, Aine breaks down in tears.\n\nBut the show also celebrates Aine\u2019s strengths. In her job as an ESL teacher, she cares deeply about her students. She also tutors English to a young French boy, helping him become less shy. In the process, she befriends his father, a stiff and taciturn man who, thanks to Aine, gradually opens up and laughs at her jokes. There\u2019s no singular moment of transformation or seismic shift. Instead, Aine\u2019s journey over the show\u2019s six episodes reflects real life, in which change often happens incrementally, in fits and starts, rather than in one fantastical, candy-coated movie or TV montage.\n\nLuke Varley/Showtime Daisy Haggard in \"Back to Life.\"\n\nIn the much darker \u201cBack to Life\u201d (which, like \u201cFleabag,\u201d aired on the BBC earlier this year and shares some of its producers), Miri Matteson (Daisy Haggard) has just returned home after serving 18 years in prison for murder. It\u2019s hard enough trying to pick up the pieces of her life. What\u2019s worse: everyone in her small English seaside town remembers her crime, and as a result, gawks at her and subjects her to vicious attacks. Someone trashes her parents\u2019 front yard, leaves a box of excrement, and spray-paints insults on their fence.\n\nWhen Miri applies for jobs, she struggles with how to explain the 18-year gap on her resume. When she finally lands a job at a fish and chips shop, someone sees her and throws a brick into the store\u2019s front window. Everywhere she goes, she feels like she\u2019s struggling to stay afloat. No one treats her like a normal person, even when they mean well, preventing her from being able to move on.\n\nFor instance, when her boss is forced to close the store after the brick incident, he encourages her to \u201chave a nice day off\u201d \u2014 by recommending she do something \u201cun-prison-y,\u201d like \u201cgoing to the zoo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the zoo,\u201d Miri says. \u201cI want to work. I want to help.\u201d\n\nHer parents tiptoe around the fact that she was in prison, like when her mom refers to it as \u201cwhen you went away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis momentous thing happened to our family, and you can\u2019t talk about it because it makes you uncomfortable!\u201d Miri says in a confrontation scene, pointing out that her mom is fine saying the word \u201ccunt,\u201d yet can\u2019t bring herself to say \u201cprison.\u201d\n\nAs the show\u2019s six episodes proceed, unraveling some dark revelations, Miri feels like she hasn\u2019t made any progress.\n\n\u201cI just want to start my life. I feel like I\u2019m not allowed,\u201d she tells her neighbor Billy, among the only people who tries to connect with her.\n\nHe points out that she\u2019s already doing it, as hard as it may feel.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s rubbish. This is it. Your life is happening now. Now,\u201d he says, glancing toward the sea. \u201cJust, whoosh. Look at that, you know?\u201d\n\nMiri\u2019s frustration is understandable. On the surface, her life doesn\u2019t dramatically change over the course of the show. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s stagnant. What seem like small steps, like being able to get out of the house and face the world, can be big ones. Sometimes, being a person is hard enough.\n\nSteve Schofield/Amazon Prime Phoebe Waller-Bridge in \"Fleabag.\"\n\nWhile both shows give off similar vibes, neither is as ambitious and as swing-for-the-fences than \u201cFleabag\u201d (or for that matter, another one of the year\u2019s best and most inventive shows, Netflix\u2019s \u201cRussian Doll,\u201d which shares similar themes, particularly in its empathetic depiction of anxiety, depression, loneliness and living with trauma).\n\nProbably nothing can top the final scene of \u201cFleabag,\u201d which is so perfect and so satisfying because it was simultaneously heartbreaking and uplifting. Whether Fleabag and the Priest would end up together was never the point. Falling for him in the first place reflects her finally being able to let genuine human connection into her life, and come out of it a stronger person \u2014 as she demonstrates in one last fourth-wall break: waving to us, the audience, while walking into the distance.\n\nIn the first season, Fleabag continually engages in self-destructive behavior as a means of numbing the pain and unprocessed grief after the deaths of her mother and her best friend. Yet over the course of the second season, we watch Fleabag grow, slowly but surely. She becomes a little more honest with herself and us \u2014 but not completely. She takes steps toward taking care of herself \u2014 but sometimes runs back toward her vices.\n\nJust like in real life, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect these shows\u2019 protagonists to be completely \u201chealed.\u201d These shows don\u2019t promise that these women will find an answer to all of their questions, a cure for all of their ills, a catharsis for all of their trauma.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s just about being able to put one foot in front of the other \u2014 and that\u2019s progress too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, man. It\u2019s hard, you know?\u201d Aine tells her therapist toward the end of \u201cThis Way Up.\u201d \u201cThe daily-ness of it can be sort of relentless. But all we can do is give it a go.\u201d\n\n\u201cFleabag\u201d is streaming on Amazon Prime. \u201cThis Way Up\u201d is streaming on Hulu. \u201cBack to Life\u201d premieres Nov. 10 on Showtime.", "description": "In \"Fleabag,\" \"This Way Up\" and \"Back To Life,\" TV is embracing personal growth that's actually realistic.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d92168b220000c602e034f2.jpeg?cache=irn0gfjgy0&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
