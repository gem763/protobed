However, the District has concerns that it may not be able to meet these recently increased demands.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came two days after a heated school board meeting about the bathroom policy reportedly drew almost 600 people, a sizable showing given that Pickens County has just over 30,000 residents.\n\nThose who spoke out during the three-hour meeting were fiercely divided on the issue.\n\n\u201cI would never in my life use a restroom in which a female is in,\u201d Nathan Barfield, a father of two, told WXIA, an Atlanta-based NBC affiliate. \u201cNo person\u2019s rights are more important than anyone else. My son has a huge heart and he doesn\u2019t want to say anything for fear that he is going to be labeled a bully.\u201d\n\nThreats of lawsuits and removing school board members during a Pickens County town hall meeting concerning gender neutral bathrooms #fox5atl pic.twitter.com/MdZe9lJTZE \u2014 denisedillon (@DillonFox5) October 15, 2019\n\nKayla Hollyfield, however, felt differently.\n\n\u201cYou should be able to use any restroom that you want to use,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not about left or right. It\u2019s about equal rights. It\u2019s not an agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Pickens County School District began allowing trans students to use bathrooms that aligned with their gender identity at the start of this school year.\n\nThe policy, Superintendent Carlton Wilson has said, was implemented after a federal court ruled in 2018 that 16-year-old Drew Adams, who is transgender, should be allowed to use the men\u2019s room at his school in St. Johns County, Florida.\n\nThe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which decided the case, also has jurisdiction over Georgia and Alabama. St. Johns County, however, has since appealed that ruling. According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the appeal hearing is scheduled for December.\n\nWilson told WSB-TV that he was disappointed by the anti-LGBTQ sentiment that was expressed by many parents at Monday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cThe way some called names has been embarrassing and disappointing to me, and that\u2019s hard to get over,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re kids. They are all kids and none deserved to be treated the way some of them have been treated.\u201d", "description": "Officials in Pickens County, Georgia, cited \"serious safety concerns\" after schools gave trans students access to facilities aligning with their gender i...", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8ad4c200000f50f506021.jpeg?cache=rtkcr1wkls&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
