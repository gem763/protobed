I was utterly baffled.'\n\nShe decided to send one final text, joking about his hangover - but she never got a response from him.\n\n'I felt humiliated,' she said.\n\nJust a couple of weeks later, Charlie's profile randomly popped up and she noticed his surname was completely different to what he had provided.\n\nBut her heart sank when she came across a picture of him snugging up to a girl.\n\n'More scrolling revealed the girl in the first photo was his girlfriend - no, wait. His fianc\u00e9e. Three months earlier - not that long before Charlie and I met in that dingy pub - he'd asked this girl to marry him, and she said yes,' she said.\n\nAfter contemplating whether or not to confront Charlie or tell his fianc\u00e9e about the affair, the woman said she decided it was best to block his profile.\n\n'For my own sanity, not because I expected to ever hear from him again,' she said.", "description": "An Australian woman who was ghosted by a man she dated has shared her horror after stumbling across his secret\u00a0fianc\u00e9e on Facebook.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/07/19382484-0-image-a-280_1570429014960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
