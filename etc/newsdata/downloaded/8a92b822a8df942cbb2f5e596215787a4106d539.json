Gregory said that brought them to a much broader audience.\n\n\"Our Skies of Fury mobile app was downloaded almost a million-and-a-half times,\" she said. \"We are really getting out there and taking ourselves to the audience, instead of making the audience come to us.\"\n\nIngenium, the crown corporation that oversees the museum, said that both it and Seed Interactive provided financial support for the game's development and that proceeds from the sale of the game would be reinvested.\n\nIngenium spokesperson Christine Clouthier said she could not be more specific about the financial details of the arrangement.\n\nStarblox will be available starting Oct. 18.", "description": "There\u2019s a new game coming to the Nintendo Switch this fall and it\u2019s an out-of-this-world creation that staff at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum helped launch.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312890.1570502139!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/starblox.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
