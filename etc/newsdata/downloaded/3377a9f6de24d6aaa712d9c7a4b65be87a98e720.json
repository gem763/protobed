The plan didn't deal with Eskom's 450 billion-rand ($31-billion) debt. Nor did it say who will be the utility's next chief executive officer, something the government has promised it would announce by Oct. 31.\n\nThe rand weakened as much as 1% against the dollar after the release of the plan, leading emerging-market currency declines. Yields on South Africa's sovereign dollar bonds due 2028 jumped 10 basis points, the most in five weeks.\n\n\"There was no discussion of Eskom debt restructuring, which is the crux of the problem investors care about,\" said Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd.\n\n\"The real takeaway is that the lack of decisiveness in today's announcement increases the importance of tomorrow's medium-term budget statement.\"\n\nA new CEO is expected to be appointed next week, Gordhan told reporters in Pretoria, the capital. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni will outline broad principles for tackling Eskom's debt when he delivers his mid-term budget on Wednesday, he said.\n\nEskom, which supplies about 95% of South Africa's power, is considered the biggest risk to the national economy.\n\nWhile the government has allocated the utility 128 billion rand in bailouts over the next three years, that won't be enough to stabilize its finances because it isn't generating enough income to cover interest payments and operating costs.\n\nNew CEO\n\nIn addition to appointing a new CEO, there will also be announcements next week on changes to Eskom's board and the creation of an interim board of three to five members for the transmission unit, according to Gordhan.\n\nThe utility has been without a permanent CEO since Phakamani Hadebe quit in July and the post has been temporarily filled by its chairman, Jabu Mabuza.\n\nFixing Eskom \"is a long protracted process, which has to be undertaken with discipline,\" Gordhan said. \"What we are clear about is that Eskom can't remain as it is.\"\n\nEskom will look to reduce its cost of coal and diesel, and is trying to renegotiate contracts it concluded with independent suppliers of renewable energy with the aim of getting them to lower their prices, according to the policy paper.\n\nThe utility's power stations will be grouped into three clusters that will compete with each other - a reorganization that international experience shows should encourage them to become more efficient and cut costs, Gordhan said.\n\nEskom's transmission unit, which has more than 5,000 employees and oversees about 45,000 kilometers (27,961 miles) of power lines, will be empowered to buy electricity both from Eskom and independent producers.\n\nThe government wants it established as a functionally independent unit by the end of March and for the spinoff process to be completed by the end of December 2020.\n\nOther Key Points:\n\nThe country will continue to rely on Eskom for base-load power.\n\nSeparating Eskom's distribution business into a separate unit requires more detailed planning.\n\nThe transmission unit will establish a systems operator to manage the security of the power system and coordinate supply and demand, and a market operator to coordinate the daily buying of electricity from generators and its sale to customers.\n\nEskom's generating plants will enter into power-purchase agreements with the transmission unit.\n\nThe utility plans to sell its finance unit, which Gordhan said is worth as much as 7 billion rand.\n\n- With assistance from Ana Monteiro and Robert Brand.", "description": "New plan will lower fuel costs, use more renewables, allow the utility to sell assets - and open up more competition.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/66915543af9c4ac48c73635a713151b3_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
