It came out last year, but it wasn\u2019t great at the time. It\u2019s improved significantly now.\n\nYou just need to install the Your Phone app on your Android phone and your Windows 10 computer, link your Android phone to your Microsoft account, and off you go, texting your friends and family from your computer.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nMicrosoft and Samsung announced that they\u2019re working together to bring text messaging to Windows 10 computers for Samsung Galaxy Note 10 users.\n\nThat\u2019s fantastic. The new Galaxy Note 10 has Microsoft\u2019s \u201cYour Phone\u201d feature built into the phone, ready to connect with your Microsoft account. Once you set it up, you can start sending and replying text messages from the Your Phone computer app on your Windows 10 machine.\n\nIt\u2019s something that Apple users have been used to for years now, and it\u2019s understandably a factor in why Apple fans don\u2019t want to leave the Apple ecosystem.\n\nRead more: Google has started rolling out Android 10 \u2013 here are the 10 best new features and updates to look out for\n\nBut the Your Phone app isn\u2019t just compatible with the Galaxy Note 10: Microsoft released the app last year, and it\u2019s compatible with pretty much every Android phone out there. Just download the Your Phone app on your Android phone and Windows 10 computer and set it up.\n\nYour Phone wasn\u2019t reliable when I first tried it last year, and I stopped using it pretty quickly as a result. But it\u2019s improved, and I now feel comfortable in using it on a daily basis.\n\nStill, it\u2019s missing a few features, like text message management. You can\u2019t delete texts in the desktop Your Phone app, it\u2019s still a little buggy here and there, and you can\u2019t make calls from your Windows 10 computer yet.\n\nCheck out Microsoft\u2019s Your Phone app, which I\u2019ve been using with a Google Pixel 3 XL:\n\nYour Phone is fairly easy to set up on Android phones and Windows 10. It\u2019s not as seamless as it is with iPhones and Mac computers, but I\u2019m not complaining too much.\n\ncaption I ran into some issues when I first set up Your Phone. Messages I sent wouldn\u2019t register as sent, and I wasn\u2019t receiving replies. But those issues seem to have ironed themselves out after a day. source Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nJust like Apple\u2019s Messages ecosystem with an iPhone and a Mac computer, I can send and receive text messages with an Android phone and Windows 10, including messages with photos and GIFs.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nBut some messages with certain content, like contact details and videos, don\u2019t work with Your Phone yet. It tells me to view that kind of content on my phone, which somewhat defeats the point. Hopefully this is on Microsoft\u2019s list of things to add to Your Phone.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nAnd while some messages appear on the list, the text is missing on older messages.\n\ncaption I\u2019m looking at the same text message on my phone and it\u2019s full of text, but all that text doesn\u2019t show up on Your Phone on my Windows 10 laptop for this older text message. source Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nYou can\u2019t make calls from the Your Phone app on a Windows 10 computer yet, either. But Microsoft said it\u2019s working on it.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nYour Phone does something that Apple\u2019s Messages ecosystem doesn\u2019t: It shows you the last 25 photos you took, and you can click and drag them onto your desktop.\n\nsource Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider\n\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m just happy to send and receive regular text messages on my Windows 10 laptop. I forgot how great that feature was when I left the Apple ecosystem and switched to Android and Windows 10. Microsoft still has some ways to go, but if you use an Android phone and Windows 10, it\u2019s absolutely worth setting up. It costs nothing and there\u2019s nothing to lose, and it\u2019ll surely improve over time.", "description": "Business Insider - Android users can send and receive text messages from their Windows 10 computers with Microsoft's \"Your Phone\" app..
