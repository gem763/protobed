Trehaus\n\nKiasu parents, at the ready: an exclusive preschool in Singapore is promising to teach your precious tots soft skills like grit, adaptability and empathy to survive the digital age.\n\nTrehaus preschool, which accepts children between 2 months and 6 years old, will start its first intake of students in September, it said on Wednesday (Sept 11).\n\nIt costs S$2,568 per month for a full-day programme and S$2,354 for a half-day programme.\n\nAfter adding in various fees and a refundable deposit, the cost of enrolling a child in Trehaus under the full-day programme will set parents back S$39,994 per year.\n\nTrehaus\n\nCalling itself a \u201cSilicon Valley-inspired preschool\u201d, the school\u2019s curriculum was designed by early education experts from institutions including Stanford\u2019s Bing Nursery and Silicon Valley\u2019s Khan Lab School.\n\nThe school\u2019s six programmes are each themed after a job (CEO, engineer, philanthropist, athlete, creative, and chef) and aim to teach children the skills associated with it, such as entrepreneurship, coding, public speaking, teamwork, design thinking, and cooking.\n\nTrehaus\u2019 school head Carolina Sam said that grit, which \u201cencompasses determination, toughness and resilience\u201d, would help children look at failures and mistakes in a positive way.\n\n\u201cThis plays a large role in their ability to be successful in school and in life,\u201d she added.\n\nShe said that children would be taught about grit through a \u201cNo Failure, Only Feedback\u201d policy that encourages them to work on their abilities and treat failure positively. Teachers also teach children to take calculated risks, expand their comfort zones, and learn emotional skills, such as how to self-soothe and self-regulate.\n\nTrehaus\n\nApart from a bilingual English and Mandarin programme, Trehaus is also offering a pure Mandarin immersion programme to give students a headstart in reading and writing Chinese.\n\nParents who have flexible working arrangements can also work in an office-style space in the preschool while their children go to classes. Trehaus\n\nTrehaus founder Dr Elaine Kim said the preschool hopes to prepare children for \u201ca future disrupted by technology\u201d, where soft skills become more important than hard skills.\n\n\u201cMore than 50 per cent of the jobs that exist in the next 50 years don\u2019t even exist today,\u201d said Kim. \u201cThe skills children learn in our programme will prepare them for this future.\u201d\n\nTrehaus\n\nTo help children gain skills quickly, \u201cloving\u201d and \u201cnurturing\u201d teachers will act as co-parents, Trehaus said.\n\nThe school boasts a teacher-child ratio of 1:5, which is at least two times higher than recommended minimums.\n\nIn comparison, government guidelines stipulate that preschools must have a teacher-child ratio of at least 1:12 for those aged two to three, 1:18 for those aged three to four, 1:20 for those aged five, and 1:25 for six-year-olds.\n\nRead also:\n\nThe world\u2019s largest pre-school just opened in Singapore but sending your child there could cost $21,000 a year\n\nPCF Sparkletots is setting aside S$20 million to be spent over the next three years \u2013 and it will all go towards developing teachers\n\n12 of the most beautiful kindergartens around the world", "description": "Business Insider - The school's 6 programmes are each themed after a job: CEO, engineer, philanthropist, athlete, creative, and chef..
