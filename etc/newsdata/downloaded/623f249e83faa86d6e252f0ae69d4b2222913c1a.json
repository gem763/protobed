One summer when it felt like everything was out of control \u2014 there had been a breakup, a move, job changes, and some other personal-life tumult \u2014 I came across Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n\u2019s books. She\u2019s a Buddhist nun in her 80s who lives in an abbey in Nova Scotia and advocates for embracing the worst parts of uncertainty.\n\nA friend had recommended her to me, saying he liked to keep extra copies of her books around. \u201cIt\u2019s good to give them to people,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone suffers so much they can always use some help, some new insights.\u201d\n\nWell, okay, I thought. I could use some help. I could use some new insights. So I bought Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n\u2019s best-known book, When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times. I hadn\u2019t thought I\u2019d be into books with titles like that, but then I was.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re willing to give up hope that insecurity and pain can be exterminated,\u201d she writes, \u201cthen we have the courage to relax with the groundlessness of our situation.\u201d Also: \u201cWe think we have some choice to make, some alternative to just hanging out with not solving anything, not resolving anything.\u201d And later: \u201cWe will never get everything together.\u201d Combined, these felt like an aha moment for me. Almost like that magic trick where you whip the tablecloth out from beneath all the place settings in one quick jerk.\n\nBorn Deirdre Blomfield-Brown in New York City in 1936 (she\u2019s 83), Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n began studying Tibetan Buddhism in 1972 and became an ordained nun in 1974, at 38. During her studies, she was given the name Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n, which roughly translates to \u201clamp of the truth.\u201d Before becoming a nun, she\u2019d been married and divorced twice, and the story of how her second marriage ended is another detail that got my attention: \u201cI was standing in front of our adobe house drinking a cup of tea,\u201d she writes. \u201cI heard the car drive up and the door bang shut. Then he walked around the corner, and without warning he told me that he was having an affair and he wanted a divorce.\u201d After this divorce, she fell into a depression that eventually prompted her interest in Buddhism \u2014 she has said that in the depths of her grief, she came across an article by a monk who suggested making peace with discomfort rather than trying to banish it.\n\nCh\u00f6dr\u00f6n has gone on to speak and write extensively about discomfort and uncertainty (her books are mostly transcriptions of her talks), and this message \u2014 that discomfort and uncertainty can\u2019t be avoided but can instead be welcomed \u2014 was what resonated with me, too.\n\nAt first, it seemed gloomy, but in reality it was surprisingly light. It was funny, too. \u201cAs long as you are wishing for things to change, they never will,\u201d Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n writes in Start Where You Are: A Guide to Compassionate Living. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re wanting yourself to get better, you won\u2019t.\u201d Well, shoot. \u201cWithout giving up hope \u2014 that there\u2019s somewhere better to be, that there\u2019s someone better to be \u2014 we will never relax with where we are or who we are \u2026 Hope robs us of the present moment.\u201d\n\nIn addition to living in an abbey, Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n is a vegetarian, she wears robes, and she cuts her hair short. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a monastery, there\u2019s nothing you can do at Gampo Abbey that\u2019s fun,\u201d she writes, \u201cunless you like to meditate all the time or take walks in nature, but everything gets boring after a while.\u201d She adds, \u201cIt\u2019s just a very uncomfortable place\u201d because \u201cyou can\u2019t get away from yourself there.\u201d Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n has two children and multiple grandchildren, and I\u2019ve wondered how being a nun has affected her family life. Her kids were 13 and 15 when she decided to pursue this path. \u201cHow did they take that news?\u201d Oprah once asked. \u201cMy son \u2026 says he took it in stride,\u201d Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n replied, \u201cbut my daughter \u2026 took it as quite a rejection.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring that even a nun who writes so insightfully also has a lot of pain in her own life, from the serious to the petty; she has also written about how she\u2019s still \u201chaunted by distaste\u201d when she hears that things are going well for certain people she knows. I appreciated her insight into why we behave horribly sometimes toward the people we care about: \u201cBecause you\u2019re lonely, you say cruel words; because you want someone to love you, you insult them.\u201d\n\nThis may be cheesy, but her books have felt like a life raft for me, like a kickboard to hold on to in a sea of change. This way of seeing the world \u2014 What if I accepted this? And that, and even that other thing, too \u2014 feels revelatory, like it can\u2019t be unseen.", "description": "The Tibetan Buddhist nun and author Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n writes about how to accept uncertainty and discomfort.
