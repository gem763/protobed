Two senators think so", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The Chinese-owned video application TikTok may be a national security threat to the U.S. and should be investigated, two key senators said in a letter to the acting director of national intelligence. Bloomberg\n\nTwo senators across political parties are concerned about TikTok\u2019s ever-increasing popularity and influence in the United States.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., jointly sent a formal request to intelligence officials to investigate and provide a congressional briefing on the possible counterintelligence risks posed by the social media app TikTok, according to a press release Thursday.\n\nThe popular short-form video app, owned by the Beijing-based company ByteDance, has come under scrutiny for not showing any information on the Hong Kong protests. A report published late September by the Guardian found that its moderators were told to censor references to Tianenmen Square and Taiwanese and Tibetan independence.\n\nThe senators referenced this report in their letter, stating that material \u201cdeemed politically sensitive to the Chinese Communist Party\u201d is reportedly hidden from TikTok.\n\nTikTok is unavailable in China; instead, ByteDance offers a domestic version of the app called Douyin. Because of this technicality, Schumer and Cotton wrote that they are concerned that \u201cByteDance is still required to adhere to the laws of China.\u201d\n\nAdditional concerns stem from the possibility that TikTok may be exploited for foreign influence campaigns, as was the case with Facebook during the 2016 election.\n\nFurther, a Wall Street Journal report published Monday found that ISIS militants have been posting propaganda and torture videos on the site, in a possible effort to recruit using the service. The videos have since been removed.\n\nThe app has been downloaded over 94 million times since its launch in the United States, Adam Blacker, the vice president of insights at app analytics company Apptopia, told USA TODAY. Nearly half of TikTok\u2019s users, he added, are under the age of 20.\n\nAn AFP collaborator poses for a picture using the smart phone application TikTok on December 14, 2018 in Paris.
