Last month, easyJet also unveiled proposals to fly the 260 miles from Birmingham to Glasgow.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The Dutch flag carrier has stated it has long-term plans to increasingly swap out short-haul hops for rail journeys where possible \u2013 provided service and convenience aren\u2019t compromised \u2013 in part because it is taking its own \u201cFly Responsibly\u201d initiative seriously.\n\nThe scheme aims to create a sustainable future for air travel, advocating for collaboration and sharing of best practice across the aviation industry. This summer, the airline even released a video asking travellers: \u201cDo you always have to meet face to face?\u201d and \u201ccould you take the train instead?\u201d An airline, encouraging people not to fly?

This giraffe will be rehabilitated and return to the wild, as a number of others have done before him. Right now, giraffes are undergoing what has been referred to as a silent extinction. Current estimates are that giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40 percent in three decades, plummeting from approximately 155,000 in the late 1980s to under 100,000 today. The decline is thought to be caused by to habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching, but because there haven't been long term conservation efforts in the past, it's hard to know exactly what is happening.

Naskmariz/PhotoVoice/Frontline AIDS/PITCH\n\nIt seems in stark contrast to British airlines launching routes that are largely already connected by rail. Virgin Trains runs an efficient, regular service from Birmingham New Street to Edinburgh Waverley, for example, taking just over four hours.\n\nWhile it can\u2019t compete with the flight time of one hour and 15 minutes, the train journey eliminates the 90-minute wait at the airport, the journey to and from the airport at either end, plus the inevitable dilly-dallying after touch down. And, lest you think it would be unfair to deny the good people of Birmingham an air link to the Scottish capital, they already have one: up to eight a day, in fact, courtesy of Flybe.\n\nAt a time when the idea of flygskam (flight shame) and giving up or cutting back on flying to reduce carbon emissions is gaining more traction than ever \u2013 thanks partly to Greta Thunberg and her recent travels by train and boat \u2013 should airlines really be encouraging travellers to get on a plane when there are already viable alternatives? Or should they be following KLM\u2019s lead and prioritising sustainability where possible?\n\nIn fairness to easyJet, the airline has teamed up with American start-up Wright Electric to assist in developing the first commercial electric aircraft. The aim is to build a 150-seat passenger jet capable of flying 300 miles (enough for the Birmingham-Edinburgh stint) \u2013 however, in the start-up\u2019s own words, \u201cwe\u2019re nowhere close to a commercial plane\u201d.\n\nIn the meantime, taking a train instead of a plane when travelling within England, Scotland and Wales would seem the easiest way of saving on emissions. And, hopefully, money \u2013 The Independent recently revealed that going by rail rather than flying works out cheaper for short-notice bookings between London and Edinburgh.\n\nIt takes a bold airline to say people should fly less. It takes an even bolder one to step up and offer train journeys instead of flights. Let\u2019s hope our own airlines \u201cwoke\u201d up \u2013 while there\u2019s still time.", "description": "In the same week that KLM \u2013 currently the top contender for world\u2019s most woke\u00a0airline \u2013 announced it would be replacing one of its daily short-haul flights with a train service, two of the UK\u2019s carriers have done the exact opposite: proclaimed they will up\u00a0their domestic routes.", "authors": ["Helen Coffey"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/12/12/istock-998655644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
