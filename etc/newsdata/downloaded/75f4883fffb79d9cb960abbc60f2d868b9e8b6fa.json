The structures, designed as prototypes for homeless housing, came out of an architecture initiative called Yeezy Home \u2014 part of the the rapper-turned-entrepreneur's design empire, Yeezy.\n\nImages of the domes, first published by TMZ, showed a collection of futuristic mounds covered by a tidy grid of wooden slats. The domes were inspired by \"Star Wars,\" specifically the settlements on the desert planet of Tatooine. Those fictional homes' namesake is Tataouine, a city in Tunisia with sand-colored dwellings that resemble stacked caves.\n\nA left-over set from a Star Wars film in Tozeur, Tunisia.

That led county officials to discover that West had not secured the proper permits to build the domes on his land.\n\nRead more: California's homelessness crisis is spiraling out of control. These mayors want to solve it with tiny homes, trailers, and floating apartments.\n\nTMZ reported that West's homes were supposed to be temporary structures (they're prototypes, after all), but an LA county inspector took issue with the fact that they were built on a concrete base, which signaled that they could be permanent.\n\nThe Department of Public Works gave the rapper 45 days to either acquire the necessary permits or tear the homes down. About a week before the deadline, three of the prototypes had been demolished.\n\nWest's plan to become a major developer could have better luck in Wyoming\n\nWest has expressed a desire to someday develop entire cities.\n\n\"I'm going to be one of the biggest real estate developers of all time, like what Howard Hughes was to aircrafts and what Henry Ford was to cars,\" West said in an interview with radio and television personality Charlamagne Tha God. \"I'm tired of the McMansions, all the Spanish roof homes and stuff like that.\"\n\nWest's Wyoming ranch includes a restaurant, saloon, shooting range, multiple cabins, and horse barns. Agostini/Invision/AP; J. P. King Auction Company\n\nIn LA, there's certainly a need for more affordable housing. The city has more than 36,000 homeless residents\u2014 a 16% increase since 2018. But the number of housing permits awarded by the city is expected to drop by 12% from 2018 to 2019.\n\nMost of LA's residential land is still zoned for single-family properties, which restricts the amount of land available for new affordable housing.\n\nLA Mayor Eric Garcetti has even encountered obstacles in his efforts to help homeowners install accessory dwelling units for the homeless in their backyards \u2014 he previously told Business Insider that construction costs can be prohibitively high.\n\nShould West choose to re-build the domes or create new ones, he may have better luck in Wyoming, where he recently purchased a $14 million ranch that spans around 3,000 acres.\n\nWith less than 650 homeless residents, Wyoming doesn't have the same pressing need for new affordable housing, but it could be more amenable to new construction. The state's number of residential building permits rose nearly 12% from 2016 to 2017 (the last year for which data was available).\n\nThere's also a lower chance that neighbors will complain about noisy construction.", "description": "Kanye West reportedly did not secure the necessary permits for the futuristic housing project he constructed on his property in Calabasas, California.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7fb19a2e22af1c846325f6-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
