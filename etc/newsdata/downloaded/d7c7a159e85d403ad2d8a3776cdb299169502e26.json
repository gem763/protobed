It just stimulates that part of your brain that says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m kind of in the mood.\u2019 And so, isn\u2019t that a wonderful thing. And it\u2019s not a drug, so I love it.\u201d\n\nThe actress said that while many of their contemporaries can barely get out of bed, she and Hamel are having sex twice a day.\n\n\u201cI usually say I sleep through one of them,\u201d Somers joked. \u201cThat\u2019s usually that one at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning. But, you know, then again around 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, I\u2019m in the mood.\u201d\n\nSomers and Hamel have been married since 1977 \u2014 and she insisted the sparks are still sizzling.\n\n'THREE'S COMPANY' STAR SUZANNE SOMERS OPENS UP ABOUT REGROWING HER BREAST AFTER CANCER BATTLE\n\nSUZANNE SOMERS DETAILS LAST CONVERSATION WITH JOHN RITTER, TALKS BOUNCING BACK AFTER 'THREE'S COMPANY' FIRING\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s just so beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cI had sex with him on our very first date just in case there wasn\u2019t a second one. I just wanted to be with him that first time.\u201d\n\nSomers' declaration for Hamel comes just weeks after she endured backlash from social media users, who expressed strong opinions about her Instagram snap celebrating her 73rd birthday in nothing but her \u201cbirthday suit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 73, I love the way I feel,\u201d Somers told Fox News exclusively at the time. \u201cI love my great health, I adore my husband and family and it was very hot that day! Haha.\u201d\n\nHamel also wasn\u2019t worried about \u201cthese few haters.\u201d\n\nSUZANNE SOMERS CATCHES 'BIRTHDAY SUIT' NUDE PIC BACKLASH: 'WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?'\n\nSUZANNE SOMERS ROCKS 'BIRTHDAY SUIT' FOR 73RD BIRTHDAY IN INSTAGRAM PICTURE: 'HERE I AM'\n\n\u201cI am uncertain whether Suzanne has a comment about these few haters who routinely turn up on her digital platforms,\u201d Hamel told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s usually the same group and we ignore them and not provide them any oxygen. If Suzanne announced she had found a cure for cancer, they would still be doing their hate thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe these are people who are desperately unhappy with who they are personally and get off anonymously saying negative things about people they do not know,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt would be easy to block these folks, but we believe in the First Amendment big time.\u201d\n\nBack in 2017, Somers told Fox News her business/romance collaboration with Hamel continues to thrive decades later.\n\n\u201cI am madly in love,\u201d she declared. \u201cI still am. It\u2019s bizarre to me that after 40 years of marriage and 50 years together that I still feel that way. But he turns me on, and I think I turn him on, and it\u2019s always been like that. You know the way it is when you first start dating someone and this might be the one? That feeling has never gone away.\"\n\nSUZANNE SOMERS FANS DEFEND 72-YEAR-OLD 'THREE'S COMPANY' STAR'S NUDE BATHTUB SNAP: 'YOU STILL GOT IT!'\n\nSUZANNE SOMERS PRAISES PRESIDENT TRUMP: 'AND NOW MY CAREER IS OVER'\n\n\"So is this luck? I don\u2019t know. A good relationship is not about luck. It\u2019s about really putting in the effort to make sure that you give each other a lot of attention and respect\u2026 But if you throw in the other component of you turn one another on, that kind of makes it really great.\u201d", "description": "For Suzanne Somers, age is just a number.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1089736988.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
