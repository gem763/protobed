On average, kids in the U.S. get $30 per week, or roughly $120 per month, the survey found.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile the average hours of chores a week required by parents to earn an allowance are on par with 2016 (5.1 hours in 2019 vs. 5.3 hours in 2016), the hourly pay rate for children who have to work for their allowance has seen a dramatic 38% increase, rising from an average of $4.43 in 2016 to $6.11 in 2019,\u201d the AICPA data revealed.\n\n\n\nMost parents believe that an allowance should, at least in part, be earned. Indeed, the AICPA data revealed that 52% thing the entire allowance should be earned and another 27% think it should be partially earned and partially gifted. And data from Country Financial revealed that more than half of parents give an allowance to teach their kids that money needs to be earned. However parents dole out the allowance, they should be aware of some of these common mistakes.\n\nMistake #1: You\u2019re obsessed with how much you\u2019re giving the kids\n\nParents tend to get hung up on how much they pay their kids, but \u201cthe amount matters less than that you are using an allowance as a chance to talk about money and how to manage it,\u201d says Kimberly Palmer, the author of \u201cSmart Mom, Rich Mom: How to Build Wealth While Raising a Family.\u201d Indeed, \u201cthe most basic tool for teaching your kids about money is by offering an allowance.\u201d Kathleen Grace, the managing director of United Capital and author of \u201cPrince Not So Charming.\u201d Palmer says you should use it to \u201cget them used to handling and talking about money so it\u2019s not so much the amount as the conversation around it \u2014 how they can save or spend it.\u201d\n\nThat said, the amount isn\u2019t completely irrelevant and should reflect their age. Mike Falco, the president of Falco Wealth Management near Philadelphia, recommends as a very rough rule of thumb $1 per week for each year of your child\u2019s life; so a five-year-old would get $5 per week while a 16-year-old would get $16 per week.\n\nMistake #2: You start giving the allowance too late\n\nRoughly half of parents still aren\u2019t giving their kids an allowance by age 8 \u2014 and experts say that\u2019s a mistake. Palmer recommends doing it \u201cas soon as they grasp the concept \u2014 around 5 years old or when they start kindergarten\u201d and Falco says you should do it \u201cas soon as they can count money,\u201d which is around four or five years old. This way, money \u2014 and an appreciation for things like saving it and what it is used for \u2014 become a part of their lives very early on. \u201cThe sooner they learn, the more likely it will stick when it matters most,\u201d says Eric Pucciarelli, the vice president of oXYGen Financial in Atlanta.\n\nMistake #3: You give an allowance to your son differently than you do your daughter\n\nWhile nearly two in three men say they got an allowance growing up, only about half of women say the same, a 2016 AICPA survey found \u2014 and experts say they still sometimes see this. But all the experts we spoke to agreed that this is unfair. \u201cBoys and girls should be treated the same,\u201d says Falco.\n\nMistake #4: You give the money with no strings attached\n\nWhen you give your kids an allowance, you should make them save at least part of it, says Pucciarelli. This will teach them to \u201csave over time for items that they want\u201d and delay gratification, says Grace. It will also help them develop saving as a habit, says Pucciarelli. Falco recommends having your children save roughly one-third of their allowance each week.\n\nPucciarelli says that you may also want to teach your kids about taxes, by making them set aside at least part of that money for taxes. \u201cThen decide whether you want to teach them to donate the jar for taxes to a charity or put in back in their savings,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nBut he cautions that \u201can allowance should not be used as leverage\u201d \u2014 as in: \u201cYou didn\u2019t take out the trash? No allowance,\u201d he says.\n\nMistake #5: You tie all the money to chores\n\nMost parents make their kids work for their allowance, by doing chores, according to the AICPA survey. But some experts (and this one is a bit controversial) say that\u2019s not always the best approach. \u201cKids should do chores and take on household responsibilities because they are part of the family, and being part of the family means contributing,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cThey are not being paid to contribute \u2014 it is expected as part of their family role.\u201d Financial columnist Ron Lieber also writes that if you peg an allowance to chores, kids will simply stop doing their chores once they have enough money.\n\nHowever, Palmer does approve of paying for chores that are outside of the regular weekly or daily chores that kids must do. \u201cI do like paying for extra chores \u2014 for example if my daughter wants to organize the shoe closet, I might pay her an extra quarter to do that,\u201d says Palmer. \u201cSo there are ways to earn extra, but ways that go above and beyond basic household chores like cleaning up after yourself or making your bed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis story was originally published in 2016 and has been updated.", "description": "Kids get an average allowance of $30 per week.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS061_allowa_ZG_20190925145144.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-06"}
