After James Anderson finished this particular job, the woman's daughter shared the receipt with his heart-melting message: \"no charge for this lady under any circumstances.\"\n\nChristine Rowlands posted a photo on Facebook of Anderson's invoice, which went viral. Rowlands wrote in the post that her mother's boiler was leaking and needed a plumber to repair. After being contacted by her sister, Anderson dropped by and fixed the issue, and said he would email the invoice.\n\nBut instead of sending a bill to be paid, he wrote on the receipt: \"No charge for this lady under any circumstances. We will be available 24 hours to help her and keep her as comfortable as possible.\" He noted that the elderly woman has acute leukemia and is receiving end-of-life care.\n\nRowlands referred to Anderson as \"an Angel dressed as a plumber.\"\n\nAnderson, who works on a volunteer basis and takes no wages for himself, owns a non-for-profit plumbing company that he started two years ago called DEPHER, which stands for Disabled & Elderly Plumbing and Heating Emergency Repair. He wants to help alleviate the costs of plumbing for elderly and others in need.\n\nHe explained to the BBC that he does it because \"many elderly and disabled are suffering in silence.\"\n\n\"They don't like asking for help. They don't want to be a burden. We take away the burden, the stigma,\" he said.\n\nThe BBC reports the company supports its efforts through crowdfunding and doing regular paid plumbing jobs. DEPHER is based in the town of Burnley, in northern England, but Anderson said his goal is to expand it nationwide.\n\nAnderson said his company's work helps keep clients from getting into debt over necessary repairs, and that he hopes to keep at it until \"the day God calls me.\"", "description": "His invoice said \"no charge for this lady under any circumstances\"", "authors": ["Christopher Brito"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/18/0e7abeba-0703-4e66-890d-b0d30f79e5f3/thumbnail/1200x630g2/4651d8fa2737e82c2caf36e5ae11bd3e/screen-shot-2019-09-18-at-12-43-41-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
