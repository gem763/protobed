The pair were all set to start a new life together with son Bertie, as they tied the knot in an emotional ceremony earlier this year, but their world came crashing down once more when Sinead was informed that her cancer had returned and that, this time, it was terminal.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to her friends and family, a series of emotional episodes will see Sinead pass away at the end of next week. With Sinead having been the love of Daniel\u2019s life, having to say goodbye will no doubt be an incredibly difficult task for the young man, so how will be cope following her death?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActor Rob Mallard said: \u2018There\u2019s been a foreshadowing of the self-destructive element, you\u2019ll see that first. The snap of the elastic, can\u2019t expect him to keep it together straight away. He has Bertie to focus on, but that\u2019s the next stage of the story \u2013 Sinead has told him all these things, forgive himself and all of that, but it\u2019s all caught up in the death.\u2019\n\n\u2018He now has to unpick all of that, the meaning and the message of what she said and actually apply it. But with the trauma and shock, you get away from that as quickly as possible. There will be changes in Daniel, but may take a bit of time to implement it.\u2019\n\nAlthough Sinead\u2019s life will come to an end, this isn\u2019t the end of the story as \u2014 much like in real-life \u2014 her close friends and family will have to come to terms with life without her, and for Daniel it\u2019ll be particularly difficult, as \u2014 in addition to mourning the love of his life \u2014 he\u2019ll also be faced with the fact that he now has to raise Bertie on his own.\n\nRob said: \u2018It\u2019s a continuation. There\u2019s two parts \u2013 there\u2019s that part to the story, and then it moves into the people who\u2019ve been left behind.\u2019\n\n\u2018Before Sinead, he was completely self-motivated and concentrated on survival, because he\u2019d been on his own for ages. I think even though he\u2019ll try to be stoic for the sake of the baby, you can\u2019t suppress the worst parts of your personality. The nastiness, the bitchiness and moaning that he\u2019s very good at.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He doesn\u2019t want to do that because of the kid and the promise that he made, but it\u2019ll probably seep into everywhere else and go onto other characters. We\u2019ve filmed stuff like that. They\u2019ll get his bad moods because he can\u2019t do it to the kids.\u2019\n\nOn Daniel\u2019s reaction to Sinead\u2019s death, Corrie\u2019s Executive Producer, Iain MacLeod said: \u2018The early phase of this story is that Daniel\u2019s is so obsessively taking care of Bertie that he\u2019s neglecting himself because he feels like the promise he made to Sinead was to look after Bertie and never let him down, but he fails to appreciate that if you\u2019re not looking after yourself, then that in its own way is still letting down your son.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Daniel's got a tough road ahead of him.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/21_10_coro_sinead_xmas_1st_ep_03-0019_1571072968.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
