The other hit was against Colts running back Nyheim Hines, which came before the hit on tight end Jack Doyle.\n\nVONTAZE BURFICT'S 'HEART IS BROKEN' OVER SEASON-LONG SUSPENSION, RAIDERS' DEREK CARR SAYS\n\n\u201cHmmmm... I wonder how many other players they've done that for in the last two or three years,\" Smith told NFL.com.\n\nBurfict received the season-long suspension last week and has filed an appeal. The appeal is expected to be heard Tuesday. NFL.com reported that Burfict will say he was trying to make a \u201cfootball play\u201d and that he wasn\u2019t trying to injure Doyle. Still, the news of a second helmet-to-helmet hit may hurt his appeal chances.\n\nIn issuing the suspension, Jon Runyan, NFL vice president of football operations, said in a letter that Burfict\u2019s circumstances were much different than other players.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS COLTS' FRANK REICH 'GLAD' VONTAZE BURFICT IS SUSPENDED FOR SEASON\n\n\u201cThere were no mitigating circumstances on this play,\u201d Runyan wrote in a letter to Burfict. \u201cYour contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game.\n\n\u201cFollowing each of your previous rule violations, you were warned by me, and each of the jointly appointed appeal officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures. However, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk.\n\n\u201cYour extensive history of rules violations is factored into this decision regarding accountability measures.\u201d\n\nThe veteran has racked up more than $4 million in fines and has been suspended 10 times due to the apparent headhunting on the field. The penalties came when he was with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe Raiders signed Burfict to a one-year, $2 million contract in the offseason.
