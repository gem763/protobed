And while pamphlets, guides, and even ages-old ukiyoe prints do their best to paint a picture of this history for visitors to the country, nothing tells the story quite like a moving image, especially when they include everyday scenes that show people of the time living their lives in the shadow of famous monuments and natural formations.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to take a peek at the past with a new video showing some amazing scenes of daily life filmed in Tokyo and Mt Fuji between the years of 1897-1915. Interspersed with some scenes from today, these black-and-white images capture the mood of the period, with young children playing games, carrying siblings on their backs, and going on school excursions while surrounded by adults dressed in kimono from the Meiji era (1868-1912) and the East-meets-West fashion style of the Taisho Period (1912-1926).\n\nTake a look at the video below:\n\nThe clip starts with some grainy footage, showing a rickshaw rider alighting from a ride dressed in a coat and top hat, which was originally filmed by French filmmaker and visual travelogue pioneer Constant Girel in Tokyo\u2019s Nihonbashi in 1897. The video then transitions to modern-day Japan with a walk through the streets of Nihonbashi (literally \u201cJapan Bridge\u201d), which is well-known for being Tokyo\u2019s traditional centre of commerce and has been the kilometre-zero marker for the country\u2019s national highways since the 17th century.\n\nAfter a minute\u2019s stroll, we step back in time once again, this time to view \u201cJapan Under The Snow\u201d at a village \u201con a slope of the Fouzi-Yama\u201d (\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71, the Japanese for \u201cFuji-san\u201d, or Mt Fuji, is transcribed here as \u201cFouzi-Yama\u201d).\n\n\u25bc Here, children enjoy snowball fights and stilt-walking, while ladies shelter under parasols.\n\nThe video then takes us back to today\u2019s world, with a snowy scene filmed at Shirakawa-Go, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Gifu Prefecture. Then it\u2019s back to 1913-1915, with fascinating views of Tokyo showing some familiar places that haven\u2019t really changed all that much, even today.\n\n\u25bc There are scenes showing the huge lanterns at Asakua\u2019s Sensoji temple.\n\nAnd scenes showing people enjoying \u201cto the fullest the pleasures afforded by the numerous parks of the Empire\u201d at Ueno Park in Tokyo (written out as \u201cUyeno Park, Tokio\u201d in the film). The park was then, as it is now, \u201ca very popular place, especially on Sunday afternoons\u201d.\n\n\u25bc The famous sakura trees at Ueno Park are bare in this winter scene, with people rugged up in coats over their kimonos outside restaurant buildings that still stand today.\n\nWhile some children play and jostle for the camera\u2019s attention, others help to look after their siblings by carrying them around on their backs, at a time when mothers were busy with big families at home.\n\nThe clip then ends at about 9:45, with the remainder of the video showing the busy streets of Shibuya today. Somehow, there\u2019s a little less charm with people walking around in modern-day clothing, instead of kimonos and top hats, yet we\u2019re left with a deeper appreciation of the city and the people who once walked about inside it. And now we\u2019re inspired to go for a deep dive into Japan\u2019s past with more videos and photos from the country\u2019s archives!\n\nSource: YouTube/Historic Video Archive\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Hachiko, Japan\u2019s most loyal dog, finally reunited with owner in heartwarming new statue in Tokyo\n\n-- Asakusa\u2019s Sensoji temple shocks store owners with sudden 16-fold rent increase in shopping arcade\n\n-- Japanese pilot flies close to Mt Fuji, asks passengers to look out the window\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/08/japanese-video-shows-what-life-was-like-in-tokyo-and-mt-fuji-100-years-ago/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "Japan is filled with historic sites that still stand today with centuries of history behind them.
