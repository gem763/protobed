In response, he said that Facebook believes in the importance of large hubs for engineers, but the company is planning to grow outside of the Bay Area.\n\n\"The infrastructure here is really, really, tapped,\" he said. He mentioned high housing costs and bad traffic as other limits to growth in the area.\n\nSan Francisco is the most expensive city in the United States for home buyers, with a median price for a single-family home at $1.3 million, a 329% increase since 2000. Average rents are more than $1,700, and the average one-bedroom apartment goes for $3,700 per month.\n\nSan Francisco's housing woes are partially due to a lack of supply \u2014 40% of housing in the city was built before 1940, and 80% was built before 1980. Reluctance to tear down historic homes to make room for more dense housing has led to high prices and a severe shortage of affordable housing, and one of the worst homelessness crises in the country.\n\nWithout accessible housing, people are leaving the Bay Area. SFGate reported that although San Francisco had a net increase in population between 2010 and 2018, most of the population growth came from international immigration, while domestically more people actually left the city than moved there.\n\nZuckerberg finished answering the question about remote work by mentioning his long-term goals for augmented reality would allow people to work together wherever they are physically, removing the need for people to live in areas like San Francisco in order to work at Facebook.\n\nRead more: Mark Zuckerberg reacted to the leaked transcript of his internal meeting by promoting it on his Facebook page\n\nMark Zuckerberg publicly livestreamed his usually private employee Q&A session on Thursday, after The Verge released leaked audio from a July Q&A of an all-hands Facebook meeting.
