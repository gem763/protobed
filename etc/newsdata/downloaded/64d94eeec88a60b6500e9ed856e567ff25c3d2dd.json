Biden Jr.\u2019s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary. The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals. \u2026 As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort. But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance\u2026 \u2018Let\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,\u2019 Ms. Bedingfield said. \u2018He and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden still leads in Warren two-to-one in South Carolina - Fox News: \u201cJoe Biden remains the clear front-runner in the latest poll in South Carolina \u2013 which holds the first southern primary in the race for the White House. But the former vice president\u2019s lead is taking a hit as top-tier rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s support soars in the contest the Biden campaign sees as a firewall. Biden \u2013 who has longstanding ties in the state \u2013 stands at 33 percent among South Carolina voters likely to cast a ballot in the state\u2019s February primary, according to a new poll from Monmouth University. That\u2019s down 6 percentage points from Monmouth\u2019s previous survey in the Palmetto State, which was conducted in July. Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, stands at 16 percent in the survey, a jump of 7 points from July. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is in third in the new poll, at 12 percent.\u201d\n\n\n\nDems nudge debate threshold to 4 percent for December - Politico: \u201cNew thresholds announced by the Democratic National Committee for the sixth debate \u2014 which will be hosted by POLITICO and PBS on Dec. 19 in Los Angeles \u2014 represent only a modest step up from the criteria for the next debate in November. But they could still seriously endanger the participation of all but the top five candidates\u2026 To make the December debate, candidates must hit 4 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls of primary voters nationally or in early-voting states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina) \u2014 or, instead, they can qualify by hitting 6 percent in two approved early-state polls. Candidates must also bring in donations from 200,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 800 donors in 20 states, territories or the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\n\n\nBernie\u2019s small-donor numbers padded by repeat contributions - WSJ: \u201cThe February day that Bernie Sanders began his second Democratic presidential campaign, Christine Peloza gave him $27, the amount Mr. Sanders often boasted was the average donation in his first run. Then, she kept giving, in $3 increments, clicking donate up to 20 times a day. By the end of June, Ms. Peloza, a 34-year-old office manager at an elderly care facility in Illinois, had donated more than 850 times to Mr. Sanders\u2026 The Sanders campaign laid claim to the majority of these \u2018super donors,\u2019 the Journal found, with about 1,000 of them. The other Democrats in the race combined for at least 650 ultra-repeat givers, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had at least 125. And President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, which began in 2017, has at least 250.\u201d\n\n\n\nGabbard, facing dimming House hopes, drops re-election bid - Reuters: \u201cTulsi Gabbard, the last House member still in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Thursday she would not seek reelection for her Hawaii seat. \u2018I believe I can best serve the people of Hawaii and our country as your President and Commander-in-Chief,\u2019 she said in an announcement posted on Twitter. Gabbard\u2019s decision clears the way for Hawaii State Senator Kai Kahele, who announced a primary challenge against her this spring. \u2018I wholly respect and appreciate Congresswoman Gabbard\u2019s decision not to pursue re-election for her Congressional seat as she pursues the Presidency,\u2019 Kahele said in a tweet.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: GUT CHECK\n\n\u201cLet us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the public safety and prosperity.\u201d \u2013 Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 85\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: LASTING LEGACY\n\nWAMU: \u201cThere have been several stories recently highlighting the last time a Washington baseball team won a World Series. The answer most given is the Senators in 1924. Now, it\u2019s true that the Senators were Washington\u2019s last major league baseball team to win a World Series. But there was another very successful team to come afterward. The Homestead Grays won three Negro League World Series titles. \u2026 Now, there are plenty of reasons why baseball enthusiasts would disagree with this argument. They might say that the Grays were not exclusively a Washington team. They were founded in Pittsburgh in 1912 and didn\u2019t start splitting time until 1940. \u2026 Like many Negro League teams, the Homestead Grays did not have a dedicated field. \u2026 Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith saw a financial benefit to letting the Grays play some of their games at his stadium in D.C.\u2026 Thus, the team became the Washington Homestead Grays.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nDEMOCRATIC 2020 POWER RANKING\n\nBiden: 27.6 points (\u2193 0.6 from last wk.)\n\nWarren: 24.8 points (\u2193 1.6 from last wk.)\n\nSanders: 14.6 points (\u2191 1.2 from last wk.)\n\nButtigieg: 6.4 points (\u2191 0.2 from last wk.)\n\nHarris: 4.8 points (\u2191 0.4 from last wk.)\n\n[Averages include: Quinnipiac University, CNN, Fox News, IBD and Monmouth University.]\n\n\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\n\nAverage approval: 41.4 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 55.6 percent\n\nNet Score: -14.2 percent\n\nChange from one week ago: \u2193 2.4 points\n\n[Average includes: Quinnipiac University: 38% approve - 58% disapprove; CNN: 42% approve - 57% disapprove; Gallup: 39% approve - 57% disapprove; Fox News: 43% approve - 55% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 45% approve - 51% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Their growing fear is that it will also determine their own. In a matter of weeks, those few senators have watched helplessly as the investigation by House Democrats has lobbed a grenade into the middle of their campaigns, putting them on the defensive amid a torrent of damaging revelations about the president\u2019s conduct with no clear end in sight. It has tightened the squeeze they were already feeling between a political base that demands unquestioning loyalty to Mr. Trump, and the moderate swing voters who may very well decide their elections. And it is one reason that support for the president in the Republican-led Senate appears to be subtly softening, a phenomenon that some of his own advisers fear that Mr. Trump does not fully appreciate.\u201d\n\n\n\nBig bucks for Trump re-elect not trickling down to Senate runs - RCP: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is raising record amounts of cash for his 2020 reelection. But that fundraising might isn\u2019t spilling over to the most vulnerable Republicans fighting to hold onto their seats in a narrowly divided Senate. During the third quarter, former astronaut Mark Kelly took in $2.5 million more than Republican Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. In Maine, state House Speaker Sara Gideon bested longtime Republican Sen. Susan Collins by over $1 million. And in Colorado, Cory Gardner, who led Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm in 2018, barely outraised former Gov. John Hickenlooper, who had been in the race just five weeks before the quarter ended. The trouble for Republicans extends to states where they\u2019re supposed to be on firmer ground. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst didn\u2019t crack $1 million and was outraised by the leading Democrat. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis narrowly outraised Democrat Cal Cunningham\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nOBAMA ON CUMMINGS: BEING STRONG MEANS BEING KIND\n\nABC News: \u201cThe funeral for Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings took place in his hometown of Baltimore Friday morning. \u2018Elijah Cummings came from good soil,\u2019 former President Barack Obama said in his eulogy. \u2018A leader who once said he\u2019d die for his people even as he lived every minute for them. His life validates the things we tell ourselves about what\u2019s possible in this country -- not guaranteed, but possible.\u2019 Obama went on to say that while hearing Cummings\u2019 daughters speak at the funeral, \u2018I was thinking I\u2019d want my daughters to know how much I love them, but I\u2019d also want them to know that being a strong man also means being kind, that there\u2019s nothing weak about kindness and compassion. There\u2019s nothing weak about looking out for others. There\u2019s nothing weak about being honorable. You\u2019re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nTrump, in partial reversal, leaves some troops in Syria - WaPo\n\n\n\nEuropean Union will wait for decision on U.K. elections before deciding on Brexit delay - Politico\n\n\n\nDems introduce bill to reclaim $3.6 billion in emergency funds used to build border wall \u2013 Fox News\n\n\n\nPergram: House GOP's naked attempt at publicity and its potential flaws - Fox News\n\n\n\nAUDIBLE: SOMEONE HAD TO TELL HIM\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been criticized for being old.

My recollection is that this is an issue apart from mere conviction/removal\u2014an additional punishment the Senate may, but need not confer. Apart from that, I suppose technically anyone can RUN for President, but if subsequent to conviction and with this disqualification applied, s/he would, if somehow elected, be legally barred from actually taking office. Love your Reports, and your appearances on FNC!\u201d \u2013 Doug Chamberlain, Hooksett, N.H.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Quite right you are. The Senate could apply that further sanction. I should have been clear on that point! Thank you for pointing it out.]\n\n\n\n\u201cMost batches or degrees do not prepare the recipient to do anything except further education. Taxpayer tuition is for the schools/universities, not students. Maybe \u2018free\u2019 tuition for a trade school would benefit the student and the community. I have two graduate degrees and have taught college level courses.\u201d \u2013 Jim Fullilove, Shreveport, La.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: America has a most distressing educational problem. College graduation rates continue to rise while high-school graduation rates continue to fall. This is a reflection of a society in which a broad elite \u2013 maybe 30 percent of the country \u2013 sees increasingly better outcomes, while the remainder is falling farther behind. It strikes me that the important work ought to be done in improving secondary education before we just punt the problem into additional years of universal education.]\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat were you thinking when you included the beloved microwave burrito along with antiquities like Fireball shots or skinny jeans? To this day, I \u2013 who travel the roads often for business \u2013 can almost always find my comfort food, the microwave burrito, at any hour at any convenience store. It is the perfect culinary treat, containing every food group, \u2026 and prepared \u2018fresh\u2019 in an aged microwave found buried at the back of the store with pre-set numbered times - as to which you must simply guess. The cheese, beans and other contents are irregularly heated in wonderful patches, and the corners of the flour tortilla without moisture become perfectly crunchy (or just hard). The last salty savory bite from the bottom of the slightly melted plastic wrapper is like the last Oreo in a pack, and it compels you to wonder how much longer to the next highway exit or rest stop, where you might consider getting just one more. Comparing this oasis treat with unproductive party primaries and anti-constitutional, anti-\u2018democratic republic\u2019 zanies is just wrong.\u201d \u2013 Ken Levine, Lionville, Pa.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Mr. Levine, you are a balm to a weary mind! But what you need, sir, are pepperoni rolls. On your next sojourn southwest, hang a left at Harrisburg down to Interstate 68 and ride down to North Central West Virginia. Buy a large bag \u2013 Country Club Bakery, if possible and under no circumstances with cheese \u2013 and toss them in your passenger seat. They are the ideal companion for long drives.]\n\n\n\n\u201cChris, Idea for your next book?

The scientists at the University of Richmond's Lambert Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory said they trained two groups of rats to operate the \u2018rat-operated vehicle,\u2019 or ROV, which works by having the rats push down on a copper bar that propels the tiny car forward. The rats were rewarded with Froot Loops cereal when they drove to the end of the enclosure. Kelly Lambert, head of the laboratory and lead author of the story \u2026 said researchers analyzed the rats' droppings and found both groups of rodents had an increase in hormones that control stress responses. \u2026 Lambert said the study could have implications for how researchers approach depression and other mental illnesses in humans.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cLimited government so conceived has two indispensable advantages. It avoids inexorable European-style national insolvency. And it avoids breeding debilitating individual dependency.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in National Review on July 20, 2012.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.
