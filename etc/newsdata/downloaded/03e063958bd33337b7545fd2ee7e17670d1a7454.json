Yes, and Here's Our Plan of Action", "language": "en", "text": "ServiceNow (NOW) has gotten its technical act together and looks like it can make an assault on its July zenith. The stock survived a test of the rising 200-day moving average line earlier this month and now prices are knocking on an upside breakout.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of NOW, below, we can see the success test of the rising 200-day moving average line. Prices are above the declining/bottoming 50-day moving average line and prices are in position to test/break the highs of August and September.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been slowly inching upwards from early September signaling a quiet or slow shift to more aggressive buying.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has also been improving from the middle of August and we are now just below the zero line and an outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of NOW, below, we we can see a chart in transformation. Prices are back above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been steady the past two months which is okay but a rising line is preferred.\n\nThe MACD oscillator is in a take profits mode above the zero line but it has been narrowing and a fresh buy signal could be in the offing in the near future.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NOW, below, the pattern is clear. Prices have hammered out a base and a trade at $276.93 will be an upside breakout. A possible $316 price target is being projected.\n\nBottom line strategy: Traders could go long NOW at current levels risking below $250. Add on strength above $277. The $300 area and then $315 are our price targets.", "description": "Let's drill down in the charts and indicators to see if we want to get involved on the upside....NOW", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Is Now The Time To Buy Servicenow", "Yes", "Here'S Our Plan Of Action", "Let'S Drill Down In The Charts", "Indicators To See If We Want To Get Involved On The Upside.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "Mark Sebastian", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/79e96391-a7d2-11e9-bc6a-47ddfd3b86e7.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
