The cancer must have this gene to produce, once edited, the cancer dies.\n\nThe gene-editing tool, known as CRISPR-Cas9, is injected by nanoparticles in to the patient's bloodsteam (stock image)\n\n'We looked for lots of markers, inflammation and damage, but they were perfectly fine, so this is very exciting.'\n\nProfessor McMillan, together with research partner Luqman Jabair, have applied for a grant to begin human trails within the next five years.\n\n'There are still many steps to go through before we get to the clinic stage, but I think this really proves that gene editing is going to be proved to be useful,' Professor McMillan said.\n\nThe study was published in Molecular Therapy.", "description": "Scientists (pictured) used gene-editing technology to target cervical cancer tumours in mice using 'stealth' nanoparticles, and revealed the mice treated had a 100 per cent survival rate.", "authors": ["Charlotte Karp For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/06/19475786-0-image-a-67_1570598498064.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
