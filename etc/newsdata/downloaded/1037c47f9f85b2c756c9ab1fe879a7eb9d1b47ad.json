Whether Trump had abused his power by making aid to Ukraine contingent on its government\u2019s investigating Joe Biden, he said, had been \u201cfar from proven.\u201d The president had ultimately provided both money and missiles to Ukraine after holding them up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBossert also said, however, that he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump\u2019s hiring of Rudy Giuliani, he said, had made impeachment more likely. He said that Giuliani and others were feeding Trump a \u201cdebunked conspiracy theory\u201d in which Ukraine was involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server in 2016. \u201cIt sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again,\u201d even though \u201cit has no validity.\u201d\n\nBossert\u2019s specific criticisms of Trump and his advisers occasioned some comment, and he felt it necessary to clarify that he opposes impeachment. What did not draw much attention were some of the implications of Bossert\u2019s remarks. The former aide was saying that the president is incapable of recognizing nonsense when it is put in front of him, presumably even after people like Bossert have explained why it\u2019s nonsense. It is difficult to imagine the former aide of any other president saying such a thing, let alone while apparently intending no insult. It is impossible to imagine a former aide\u2019s saying such a thing and having it be ignored.\n\nIt was ignored because President Trump gives us a lot of news to talk about, and because it was old news. Bossert did not reveal anything we could not pick up from reporting on the Trump White House or from the president\u2019s public remarks. Trump has shown a tolerance for and attachment to conspiracy theories in the past, whether concerning the birth certificate of President Obama or the alleged vote fraud of millions of illegal immigrants. He has selected advisers with terrible judgment: He frequently tells us so himself, after they have become former advisers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA similar point went unremarked in all the criticisms of the Trump\u2013Zelensky phone call. The memorandum of the call released by the White House didn\u2019t just show Trump urging the Ukrainian government to look into a conspiracy theory and investigate the Bidens. Delete those sections of the call and what\u2019s left of Trump\u2019s end of it is rambling. Trump doesn\u2019t pursue or even mention any national interests of the United States.\n\nThe Ukraine scandal is thus turning up new evidence bearing on Trump\u2019s fitness for the presidency, even as that subject recedes into the background. Instead, in the foreground, have been matters of law. Democrats are saying that the president cannot be above it, Republicans that he cannot be below it, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Democrats prepare to impeach Trump, one of their leading theories is that he broke the law by seeking a campaign contribution, in the form of valuable information, from a foreign government. The president\u2019s defenders appear to be on solid ground in saying that this theory would render a lot of normal political behavior illegal and would have disturbing implications for the First Amendment.\n\nIt\u2019s also an illustration of the limits of legalism in politics. What\u2019s disturbing about Trump\u2019s conduct has almost nothing to do with the campaign-finance laws, and an arguable violation of those laws would not by itself come close to making a compelling case for removing an elected president from office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Constitution authorizes impeachment and removal of a president in cases of treason, bribery, and \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d To modern ears, that language may lend itself to a legalistic interpretation. But while scholars disagree about the scope of the impeachment power, most of those who have studied the question agree that the Founders did not intend \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d to refer simply to the violation of statutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome lawbreaking does not rise to the level of impeachment, and some conduct can be impeachable without breaking a law. James Madison mentioned \u201cincapacity, negligence, or perfidy\u201d as impeachable presidential traits. The first federal official to be impeached and removed from office, Judge John Pickering, was found to have had too low a character for his position. If in the 1990s Bill Clinton had announced that he was going to start a harem in Saudi Arabia and run the government from there, the Congress would not have needed to consult the U.S. Code to begin impeachment proceedings. (That\u2019s an adaptation of an example from Charles Black\u2019s 1998 Impeachment: A Handbook.)\n\nThe purpose of impeachment is, in short, to protect the country from serious abuses of power and derelictions of duty. Mere political disagreement is not a sufficient reason for Congress to remove a president; nor are mere mistakes by the president. So much we can glean from the Constitutional Convention\u2019s rejection of \u201cmaladministration\u201d as a ground for impeachment and removal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that there is room for disagreement. But if the meaning of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d is not fixed, the procedural bar for removal is, and it is high. A majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate must agree that the president\u2019s conduct has made his continued tenure in office intolerable.\n\nRemoving a president therefore requires a supermajority that is highly unlikely to materialize and that Democrats are barely trying to create. President Trump\u2019s defenders have not made a strong case, or a unified case, against the allegation that he has abused his power. But they don\u2019t need to make much of a case for keeping him in office through his term: Our constitutional design powerfully militates in that direction, and all Trump needs in order to beat back impeachment is to stave off a collapse of his political support.\n\nCongressional Republicans grasp this point. They know that their political fates are tied to his in the next election. They can\u2019t break free. Most of them also know that vocal defenses of him are likely to be undermined by the president\u2019s next tweet. Hence their preference for silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo we have quickly reached a stalemate. Washington, D.C., has settled into the view that impeachment is likely to occur and conviction not to. It appears that we are likely to spend the next few months talking about everything but the political judgments the process calls for.", "description": "Our distorted lens on impeachment.", "authors": ["Ramesh Ponnuru", "Robert Verbruggen", "Jay Nordlinger", "Katherine Timpf", "Douglas Murray", "John Mccormack", "Charles C.
