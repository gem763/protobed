The Associated Press and others reported that in the clubhouse later on, without prompting, he said, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe threw, he felt good,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what transpires between now and tonight. But he says he feels good.\u201d\n\nMartinez does not plan to cap Scherzer\u2019s pitch count if he starts.\n\n\u201cIf Max tells me tonight that he\u2019s good, then Max will pitch until his neck decides he can\u2019t pitch anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself telling Max, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re only going to go 75 pitches.\u2019 He\u2019s going to want to go out there and go as long as he can.\u201d\n\nThe manager said Scherzer flew to Houston with the team \u2014 \u201cWe sat him up in first class so he had a lot of room\u201d \u2014 and woke up Tuesday feeling ready to throw.\n\nScherzer received a cortisone shot on Sunday, which doctors told him would take about 48 hours to set in and alleviate the pain in his muscles and around the nerve.\n\nScherzer might also have his usual batterymate back, too. Catcher Kurt Suzuki is available Tuesday for the first time since Game 3, when he hurt his hip flexor while blocking a pitch. Yan Gomes will start, but Suzuki can pinch-hit or even catch if the Nationals need him.\n\nThe plan, then, is for Suzuki to catch Scherzer in Game 7 \u2014 if Washington gets there.\n\nStephen Strasburg will start Game 6, with An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and Patrick Corbin both available out of the bullpen.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
