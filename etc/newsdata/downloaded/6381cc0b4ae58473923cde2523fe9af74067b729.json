Photo: YouTube\n\nA Little Late With Lilly Singh ostensibly airs at 1:35 a.m., but really exists in a timeless, deathless state of eternal return on YouTube. Singh not only just had her first week of shows; she guested on her late-night uncles\u2019 shows and had a primetime special on Wednesday night. It was a week for bold swings and standing in your truth. Sometimes your truth is that you think Dude, Where\u2019s My Car? should have won an Oscar; sometimes it\u2019s that you don\u2019t know who Ash Ketchum is. Let\u2019s look at what worked best on late night this week.\n\n5. Billy Porter Makes an Entrance on The Late Late Show\n\nThe Late Late Show With James Corden does entrances a little differently. Guests come out at the same time, having to negotiate stairs as well as fans clamoring for high fives. Reggie Watts always plays them on with an up-tempo, James Brown\u2013esque backbeat. Until now, the most rad thing a person had done in that entrance was jump a few steps. But in swans Billy Porter. Literally. Dude had wings. And not only did he serve a look, he did a walk and a runway turn. He approached the couch, immediately turned around, and took another lap through the adulating crowd. That\u2019s how you have fun with late-in-life fame.\n\n4. Seann William Scott Would Like to Thank the Academy\n\nSeann William Scott says he and Ashton Kutcher thought Dude, Where\u2019s My Car? was Oscar-worthy, and after Bohemian Rhapsody won for editing, who\u2019s to say he\u2019s wrong? Apologies to Mr. Scott, but his actual most underrated performance is in Southland Tales, when there are two Seanns William Scott and if they touch, it will end all of existence.\n\n3. Tracee Elliss Ross Shares Her Instagram Tips\n\nLike most of us, Lilly Singh is in awe of Tracee Ellis Ross. How can she be that pretty? And have hair that lustrous? And take solo vacations without spiraling into an anxiety K-hole? We know the answer to at least the third question: Ross uses her vaycay time to take endless selfies. She props her phone up with towels, abuses the ten-second self-timer and burst function, then spends the rest of her time scrolling through for the one usable pic. Nobody can say \u201cGet of your phone and experience all this nature!\u201d when you\u2019re traveling alone.\n\n2. Seth Meyers I-Don\u2019t-Know-Her\u2019d Ash Ketchum\n\nThe \u201cWhat Does Karen Know?\u201d segments can be a little lopsided. Late Night writer Karen doesn\u2019t know about things that happened before she was born, naturally. But Seth Meyers is at least somewhat plugged into things that are happening now when he is, technically, alive. But he didn\u2019t know who Ash Ketchum was. And what\u2019s more, he didn\u2019t care that our boy is finally a Pok\u00e9mon Master! Okay, in Alola, but that\u2019s not nothing. Karen, meanwhile, did not realize that Seth was quoting the lyrics to \u201cIce Ice Baby.\u201d We all learn something when the generations have dialogue.\n\n1. Jena Friedman Listed All the True-Crime Podcasts on Conan\n\nJena Friedman\u2019s set on the true-crime industrial complex was one of the bravest things I\u2019ve seen on late night. Conan shoots in the middle of the afternoon, which is not the time of day most conducive to laughing at our country\u2019s fetishization of dead white women. The audience awww\u2019d Jeffrey Epstein, that\u2019s how unready they were for this material. But we\u2019re not in a great place when Kavanaugh has a Supreme Court seat and, as Friedman pointed out, Ted Bundy has two Netflix specials.", "description": "A roundup of some of our favorite late-night television clips of the week from shows hosted by James Corden, Seth Meyers, Conan O\u2019Brien, and newcomer Lilly Singh.", "authors": ["Bethy Squires"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/20/20-late-night-seth-meyers-pokemon-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
