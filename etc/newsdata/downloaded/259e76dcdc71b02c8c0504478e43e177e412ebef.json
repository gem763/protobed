He was 71.\n\nBarrere\u2019s passing was announced Saturday by surviving members of the band, who honored his contributions to the music world. He died Saturday morning at a hospital in Los Angeles due to side effects from an ongoing treatment for liver disease.\n\n\u201cPaul, sail on to the next place in your journey with our abiding love for a life always dedicated to the muse and the music,\u201d Little Feat\u2019s Bill Payne, Sam Clayton, Fred Tackett, Kenny Gradney and Gabe Ford said in a statement.\n\nLittle Feat\u2019s lead guitarist, singer and main songwriter, Lowell George, died in 1979. But Barrere was a foundational part of Little Feat\u2019s funky, blues-inflected Southern rock. He wrote or co-wrote some of the band\u2019s most beloved songs including \u201cSkin It Back,\u201d \u201dTime Loves a Hero\u201d and \u201cOld Folks Boogie.\u201d\n\nAfter initially auditioning as a bassist, Barrere joined the band three years after its founding in 1969. The band would carve out a distinct, danceable American sound of their own that melded blues, rockabilly, country, gospel and funk.\n\nLittle Feat is currently on a 50th anniversary tour that Barrere sat out due to his health. It was set to wrap up Sunday in Wilks-Barre, Pennsylvania.\n\nBonnie Raitt, with whom Barrere also played, remembered the guitarist Sunday, calling him \u201ca cornerstone of one of the greatest bands of all time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will hold him in our hearts and celebrate his life and music always,\u201d Raitt said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Paul Barrere, guitarist and singer for the rock group Little Feat, has died.
