These are the consequences\n\nWith increasing poverty, we face the real threat of losing our humanity and becoming a more criminal society. There will not be enough prisons to contain our violence\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa must be applauded for his recent frank admission that too many South Africans remain trapped in poverty despite the many advances made since the dawn of democracy.\n\nOver the years we have coined many slogans to the point that one would be tempted to believe that we conquered this monster called poverty.\n\nThere is no doubt that over the many years since 1994 and in the context of what apartheid created, we have made serious advances in addressing the incidence of poverty.\n\nIt will be foolhardy not to appreciate that the various measures successive democratic governments adopted did impact on the incidence of poverty.\n\nIn equal measure, and that is the point of the president, poverty continues its vicious attack on society and communities.\n\nPart of the reason for this ongoing assault is the fact that inequality persists and our material conditions are not changing that much.\n\nThe demand continues to far exceed the supply.\n\nAccess to many services has improved, but the ability and the capacity of the state to deal with the apartheid monster and its consequences remain constrained.\n\nThe picture of Zinhle Maditla after her sentencing to four life terms for killing her four young children is probably the most pronounced example of what poverty can do to a human being.\n\nMurder is a heinous crime and by all means deserves the harshest sentence.\n\nOn the face of it, one cannot fault the court for the harsh sentence imposed on her for the murders.\n\nHowever, one must appreciate that this is a 25-year-old woman already with four children. She is reported to have been 14 when she had her first child.\n\nShe was unemployed and most likely unskilled. The fathers of her children are most likely unemployed and unskilled.\n\nRead: SA is \u2018haunted\u2019 by fear of criminals\n\nThe four innocent souls who lost their lives were born and condemned to a life of poverty just like their parents.\n\nIt is inexcusable to take a life, whatever the circumstances, however, it is equally sad and heartbreaking when a person who hardly had a life as a child becomes a parent who hardly has a life.\n\nIt is painful to see a young woman settled with such a big responsibility in circumstances where she can hardly make means to survive.\n\nThe cruelty of poverty must have been the true cause of Maditla falling pregnant for the first time at that tender age.\n\nIt should have not happened in the first place and does not happen unless there are extraordinary circumstances such as poverty and abuse.\n\nMuch has not been said about her family background and the circumstances under which she had a child at that age.\n\nNothing has been said about the fact that she went on to have three other children even as her material condition worsened in the trap of poverty.\n\nAll we hear about is the heinous crime, which appears clearly premeditated, that she committed.\n\nMany will talk about the options she may have had, including family planning and adoption, but what will not be spoken of is the nature and scope of the humiliation that poverty caused her.\n\nPoverty is humiliating, it takes away the right to human dignity. Those living in poverty live a life of perpetual humiliation.\n\nThey are in a permanent and ongoing state of vulnerability.\n\nBefore anyone asks me the silly question of whether poverty is an excuse for crime, let me say that poverty is one of the root causes of crime.\n\nYoung men trapped in poverty resort to drugs and violent crime. They resign themselves to the fact that they have no option in life but to do crime to gain what they want.\n\nThey become robbers and violent people by default. For this reason, our prisons are full of young people who can only live a decent life when they are behind bars.\n\nOne often hears silly comments such as \u201cprisoners have better rights than victims\u201d.\n\nSuch comments ignore the reality that the state cannot fail perpetrators twice.\n\n\n\nPoverty, inequality and unemployment took away their human dignity and converted them into dangerous beings who do not value humanity.\n\nThey were inducted into drugs and a life of crime. They spiralled out of control and the only way to regain control is by containing them in prison.\n\nMaditla is a victim of patriarchy, poverty, inequality and unemployment. She resorted to crime to relieve herself of the burden of the complete loss of her humanity to poverty and inequality.\n\nIn the process, she became a gross violator of the rights to life of her own innocent children.\n\nMaditla did not fall pregnant courtesy of the Holy Spirit.\n\nBecause she is a woman and a mother, the reality is that, regardless of whatever situation, she was going to be settled with the mammoth task of bringing up her children single-handedly.\n\nThe gender roles defined by society allocated her the task and absolved the fathers. Her level of vulnerability could only increase with time.\n\nRegrettably, it overwhelmed her, something that ought to have been expected.\n\nMaditla could have easily opted for family planning. She could have opted for adoption.\n\nShe could have gone to her family and asked them to help with the children. She could have approached the maintenance court to force the fathers to pay maintenance.\n\nFor the armchair critics who always become wise after the event, Maditla had these and probably many other options but she may represent an unknown form of mental illness or at the very least one that is not recognised as yet.\n\nShe may not be qualified to be classified as someone who was in her right mind when she did what she did.\n\nShe was expected to behave normally in an extremely abnormal situation. After all, they will say, she is not the first to be in such a situation.\n\nWhat led her to not explore any of the options listed above? Is it because she did not know about these options or made a conscious decision not to explore any of them, or is it because none of them worked after trying hard?\n\nWhy did she not kill her first child when she first had her? How did she survive all these years and what led her to break at this point?\n\nWhere was her family, her friends, her neighbours and society when she reached breaking point?\n\nDid she talk to someone about it and if not, why. If she did, why did whoever she talked to not do anything to help?\n\nThere is a pertinent question which must be asked and answered if we are to find answers to this developing calamity in the face of grinding poverty.\n\nHow did it come about that society looked on as a young woman was obviously gradually going down the social ladder?\n\nWhere was the village that was supposed to raise Maditla, who clearly needed societal intervention?\n\nWhere was our state machinery when a teenage girl had a child and went on to have three more in a short space of time?\n\nWhere were the non-governmental and community-based organisations when a young woman was gravitating towards murderous intentions?\n\nWas there not even one person who noticed a deterioration of her situation?\n\nAt last we have moved from slogans to the reality of the appreciation that poverty is vicious and degrading.\n\nIs Maditla the only young woman in this situation? Is she the first and the last in the face of this inequality, poverty and unemployment?\n\nIs she the first and the last of the women who sit quietly in their corners, losing hope and seeing no other option than to relieve herself of the pressure by committing such a heinous crime?\n\n\n\nRegardless of the gravity of her crimes, did Maditla deserve four life sentences?\n\nWe may laugh at the apology of the president. We may think that the president is being populist or a pretender for apologising for poverty.\n\nI take his apology seriously and think it is deserving to those trapped in poverty.\n\nIf this scourge has pricked the conscience of our president, one has a better sense of hope.\n\nAt last we have moved from slogans to the reality of the appreciation that poverty is vicious and degrading.\n\nI have noticed that in one province, we spent more than R8.3 billion on alcohol in just one year.\n\nSurely we can spend just R1 billion of crowd funding to support women like Zinhle Maditla.\n\nMannya is an advocate, writer and executive director of legal services at Unisa\n\nTALK TO US What solutions can government and civil society put in place that are geared towards young single mothers?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword MOTHER and tell us what you think.
