No woman should be compelled to touch male genitals against her will, irrespective of how the owner of the genitals identifies.\u201d\n\nThe Tribunal said in its decision that Yaniv had had filed the \u201ccomplaints for improper purposes,\u201d and had contradicted herself in \u201cdisingenuous\u201d testimony. Yaniv, who is sexually attracted to women, brought 15 complaints against a number of beauticians in the Vancouver area, seeking as much as $15,000 in damages from each one.\n\n\u201cMost of the women who were the target of Yaniv\u2019s complaints work out of their own home, are of immigrant background, and have small children with them in the house during the day,\u201d the Justice Centre\u2019s report said. Yaniv also apparently accused immigrants during the trial of discrimination for refusing service on religious grounds, writing earlier this year on Facebook that \u201cwe have a lot of immigrants here who gawk, judge and aren\u2019t the cleanest of people, they\u2019re also verbally and physically abusive, that\u2019s one reason I joined a girl\u2019s gym.\u201d\n\nYaniv is being ordered to pay $2,000 to three of the accused women, one of whom was forced out of business due to the case.\n\nIn August, Yaniv was arrested for owning a taser, after brandishing it on camera during an interview about Yaniv\u2019s alleged history of predatory behavior toward children. Screen-captured messages allegedly from Yaniv highlighted intimate questions to underage girls, and legal documents showed an attempt to organize a topless pool party for such girls.", "description": "The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal has ruled against Canadian transgender activist Jessica Yaniv in a case stemming from a complaint Yaniv filed against multiple female beauticians who refused to wax Yaniv\u2019s male genitalia.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
