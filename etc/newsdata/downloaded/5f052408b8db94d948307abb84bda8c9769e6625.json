He spoke on the condition that he not be named.\n\nIn September Catalonia\u2019s biggest grassroots separatist group, the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), invited its members to a conference called \u201cThe use of new technologies in non-violent struggle: the example of Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nOnline messaging services like Telegram \u201cguarantee the reliability and the confidence of users,\u201d ANC national secretary Jordi Vilanova told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Same yellow hardhats \u2013\n\nSometimes Catalan separatist simply use the same fliers handed out in Hong Kong.\n\nAn info-graphic explaining what positions to adopt to protect yourself from police water cannons shared on social media by Catalans separatists still had instructions written in Chinese.\n\nFliers distributed on Thursday by the radical separatist group CDR reproduced an info-graphic made by Hong Kong activists that outlines how to protest yourself from tear gas and other police tools.\n\nA Catalan separatist group set up in August even started using yellow hardhats just as protestors do in Hong Kong and called itself \u201cCascos grocs\u201d in Catalan or \u201cYellow hats\u201d.\n\nHong Kong singer and pro-democracy activists Denise Ho Wan-See, cartoonist Badiucao and Berline-based Chinese artist and free speech advocate Ai WeiWei have all backed the Catalan protests on social media.\n\n\u201cThere is sympathy between these minorities which do not have enough political space to express themselves\u201d but \u201cthat does not mean that we are going to have a common strategy,\u201d said Vilanova of the ANC.\n\nChina\u2019s government-run English-language newspaper China Daily on Tuesday warned \u201cseparatism will not be tolerated in any country\u201d along with the hash-tag #HongKong and a video showing clashes between protestors and police at Barcelona airport.", "description": "Madrid (AFP) \u2013 From blocking airports to using encrypted messaging apps, Catalan separatists demonstrating against the jailing of nine of their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/f5690f_thousands-protestors-converged-on-barcelona-airport-tactic-inspired-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
