He is now a cabinet member with the Saskatchewan Party's provincial government. (Julie Crysler/CBC)\n\nScheer has said that this passion for policy dates back even further, to high school.\n\n\"Young kids \u2014 especially that age \u2014 it's just not something they're engaged in, not something they're interested in. I realized I was the odd person to have that level of interest in it,\" he said in a 2010 interview.\n\nRaised in Ottawa, Scheer met his future wife, Jill Ryan, at university, and relocated to her hometown of Regina in 2003, where they married that year. He became the MP for Regina\u2013Qu'Appelle the following year.\n\nHe became deputy Speaker in 2008, and Speaker of the House of Commons in 2011 \u2014 the youngest ever elected, at the age of 32 .
