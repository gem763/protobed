It\u2019s a big reason why the American Association of Orthodontists has noted that one in five orthodontic patients is an adult, according to report from Harvard Health Publishing.\n\nThe shift toward serving an older patient base has led to growth in the industry too.\n\nThe orthodontist industry was estimated to rake in $12 billion in 2018 based on market analysis conducted by research firm IBISWorld. Moreover, their report concluded that the industry grew 1.3 percent annually from 2013 to 2018 \u2013 most of which was credited to the rise of braces.\n\n\u201cBeauty and youth has become an enormous part of our society. When you add to that all the selfies, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook and social media \u2013 how you look and smile \u2013 because everybody smiles when they do a selfie \u2013 has become an enormous part of our culture,\u201d Dr. Kenneth Magid, DDS FICD of Advanced Dentistry of Westchester explained to FOX Business.\n\nHe added: \u201cYour confidence level, how people judge you, when you go for a job interview, when you have social situations, when you are dating \u2013 your smile says a lot about you.\u201d\n\nAndrea Palmentiero, who has shelled out over $5,000 to achieve her dream smile in time for her wedding next year, agrees.\n\n\u201cWe are in an era now when everyone is judged on their smile, and [nearly] everyone has beautiful teeth. When I was growing up, it felt like everyone had braces. I was very, very jealous even then,\u201d Palmentiero said regarding her decision to get braces as an adult.\n\nLike many people who seek braces, Palmentiero cited thumb sucking from her youth as the culprit as the culprit for her misalignment. A major life event like a wedding, which often has all eyes on the bride, was the push she needed to see a professional about her teeth.\n\nHowever, unlike Palmentiero\u2019s situation, experts say that many adults who are getting braces done now actually went through the process at least once before in their youth. More often than not, failing to wear a retainer for the recommended time is a major reason why people readdress their teeth\u2019s position.\n\nA study from 2017 even cited some millennials feeling as if bad teeth hinder their ability to secure a job.\n\n\u201cPeople harken back to that former smile. We have many new patients who scroll through their phone looking back at old school photos to show me at their initial consultation, and they say, \u2018That\u2019s how I want it to look again,\u2019\u201d Dr. Adam Goodman, DMD of Goodman Orthodontics revealed to FOX Business in an effort to illustrate why adults are willing to subject themselves to the costly and sometimes painful procedure yet again.\n\nAnother factor that plays a role in adults choosing to get braces is the ease of financing \u2013 whether it be through a payment plan offered at a doctor\u2019s office or through a specialized medical credit cards with zero interest promotions.\n\nAdults also get a wider selection of dental hardware than they did a few years ago.\n\nAccording to the professionals at Oral-B, there are traditional metal braces, some of which can have colorful bands for personal expression, and then there are ceramic braces that can match the appearance of natural teeth or lingual braces that are out of sight can sit behind teeth. Newly designed heat-activated archwires are said to \u201chelp teeth move more quickly and less painfully than in the past\u201d via body heat.\n\nFor a select few, gold braces are a fashion-forward statement that costs a pretty penny, according to Colgate.\n\nPossibly one of the most popular aligner options are the ones you can't see. Invisalign, which was founded in 1997, has been a leader in the pack when it comes to clear braces. The process involves an in-office consultation with an orthodontist who is certified to administer the Invisalign treatment as well as a personalized treatment plan and customized invisible aligners that move teeth at a quarter of a millimeter every two weeks.\n\nStocks in this Article ALGN ALIGN TECHNOLOGY $208.24 -1.80 (-0.86%)\n\nThroughout the treatment, an orthodontist will check in on the patient\u2019s progress and be able to address any unexpected issues along the way.\n\nThough it may be considered popular, not every company has gotten a smile from investors.\n\nInvisalign\u2019s competitor, Smile Direct Club, has been the leading teledentistry company since its founding in 2014. Its low-cost, direct-to-consumer business model has made Smile Direct Club a go-to for adults who want to fix their teeth without having to shell out thousands. According to Smile Direct Club\u2019s website, its clear aligners cost a flat $1,895 while Invisalign and metal braces can range between $3,000 and $7,000 depending on the condition of one\u2019s teeth.\n\nAs the trendy option, Smile Direct Club appeared to have a promising IPO with a partnership with CVS and Aetna Dental announced back in April. However, since going public last month, Smile Direct Club\u2019s stock has plummeted by 60 percent and has been dubbed one of the worst-performing IPOs of the year by some.\n\nStocks in this Article SDC SMILEDIRECTCLUB INC COM USD0.0001 CL A $9.55 +0.42 (+4.60%)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether ongoing legal battles have played a role in Smile Direct Club\u2019s tanking stocks, but this disrupter has earned the ire of dental professionals around the country.\n\n\u201cSmile Direct took the concept of Invisalign and streamlined it so that teeth could be moved in a similar fashion but without having to ever see an orthodontist, doing the process at home, for a reduced fee,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cI will state from the outset that even without a patient seeing an orthodontist for an initial examination or having the treatment monitored as it unfolds, a Smile Direct treatment can certainly be successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere most dentists and orthodontists agree is that there are instances where, despite a patient a avowing that their mouth is healthy and that they have had a recent exam, a percentage of Smile Direct patients have either decayed fragile teeth or weakened, diseased gums, and orthodontic treatment on such patients can lead to irreversible and catastrophic damage.\u201d - Dr. Adam Goodman\n\nHe also likened the direct-to-consumer impression kits Smile Direct Club provides to that of a do-it-yourself cast mold for broken bones \u2013 something that doesn\u2019t exist in the medical field and would certainly cause an uproar with doctors.\n\nWhen it comes down to which is more effective, Magid said that metal braces can achieve feats that invisible ones can\u2019t.\n\nIn his own words, \u201cYou can get better control and faster movement with classic bracket and wire braces than any form of clear aligner therapy.\u201d\n\nThough it's still no secret that adults for the most part don\u2019t want to wear metal braces for aesthetic reasons, which gives invisible aligners an advantage in the market.\n\nMagid stressed that orthodontics is all about the diagnosis, planning and execution \u2013which is why he advises people to stay away from Smile Direct Club. With X-rays and close examinations, he said orthodontists can find the root cause of teeth positioning and strategize movement mid-way. This isn\u2019t possible with Smile Direct Club because the company sends all the aligners at once.\n\nOutside of what the professionals say, consumers have made their experience known with reviews on healthcare marketplace RealSelf. On the site, 59 percent reported Smile Direct Club as \u201cWorth It\u201d while standard braces and Invisalign are at 91 percent.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nDespite this, teledentistry brands continue to pop up to meet the market\u2019s demand for perfect teeth sans metal. Candid Co., SmileLove and SnapCorrect are a few among many who are vying for a cut of those cosmetic dollars.\n\nOther adults have opted for DIY methods like using orthodontic rubber bands for closing gaps and floss for straightening crooked teeth based off of results seen in varied online forums.\n\nBoth Magid and Goodman agreed these practices can yield terrible results that may loosen, misalign and even cause tooth loss. In short, any procedure that\u2019s administered on teeth should be done by a dental professional.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAs for Palmentiero, she is happy with her choice in adult braces. For anyone who is considering it as well, her advice is the following: \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in continually bettering yourself. There is no age limit. If this is something that has been on your mind for a long time, just do it. Life is too short to not make yourself feel good.\u201d", "description": "Braces aren't just for teens and adolescents.
