The Guardian later confirmed the news.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s shock move ends months of speculation about the plans of the Bronx politician, who is hugely popular with the progressive wing of the party.\n\nRelated: Warren under attack as Democrats spar in largest primary debate in US history\n\nThe endorsement is a major coup for Sanders, whose campaign has failed to move to the top of a broad Democratic field, and a blow to his fellow progressive senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has emerged as the race\u2019s new frontrunner.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is one of the four members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, a group of four freshman congresswomen of color whose liberal policies and pointed critiques of Donald Trump have earned them praise from many on the left and virulent attacks from many conservatives.\n\nThe other squad members are Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib, Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar and Massachusetts\u2019 Ayanna Pressley. The Sanders campaign also announced on Tuesday night that Omar had endorsed the senator.\n\n.@BernieSanders isn\u2019t fighting to win just one presidential election -- he\u2019s fighting for the soul of our democracy.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s more on why I\u2019m so proud to give Bernie my endorsement for president of the United States: pic.twitter.com/1NLMPnzS1x\n\n\n\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) October 16, 2019\n\nIn a statement provided by his campaign, Omar citied their work together on legislation to cancel student debt loan and on another plan to provide school meals for students all year.\n\n\u201cI have seen the values that motivate him and his commitment to building a movement that represents marginalized communities across this country,\u201d she said. \u201cBernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography.\u201d\n\nLast month Warren earned the endorsement of the Working Families party, a prominent progressive organization that had established itself as a force in leftwing politics in 2016, when it backed Sanders for president. The group\u2019s early endorsement was a boon to Warren\u2019s candidacy as she tries to position herself as the leading liberal alternative to Biden. But it also divided the left, angering supporters of Sanders who questioned their endorsement process.", "description": "The progressive New York congresswoman will join the presidential candidate at a New York rallyAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks alongside Bernie Sanders in June.
