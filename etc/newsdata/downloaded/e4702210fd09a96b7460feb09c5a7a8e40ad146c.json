The construction of a production line for the new SUV will start in early 2020 at the group's plant in Cassino, central Italy, with the first vehicles expected to hit the market in early 2021.\n\nMaserati added it would start producing in Turin an electrified version of its Ghibli sedan, which is set to become the brand's first ever hybrid vehicle, in 2020.\n\nIt will also launch redesigned versions of its GranTurismo and GranCabrio models, the first full electric cars for Maserati.\n\nMaserati will invest 800 million euros to produce the new SUV and a further 800 million euros for the electrified versions of GranTurismo and GranCabrio. The company did not disclose the investments required for the super sports car and the Ghibli.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Giulio Piovaccari, editing by Susan Fenton)", "description": "Fiat Chrysler's  luxury brand Maserati will invest at least 1.6 billion euros ($1.75 billion) to produce its first hybrid and electric models, including a new super sports car and a new sport utility vehicle, it said on Thursday.
