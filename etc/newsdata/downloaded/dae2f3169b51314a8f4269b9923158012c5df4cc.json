This year, it\u2019s also showdown time. London Fashion Week is going full steam ahead in the face of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s planned action to bring it to a standstill \u2013 the closing show is XR\u2019s staged funeral procession \u201cto commemorate the loss of life due to climate and ecological breakdown\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt who will win this battle. You don\u2019t take on a \u00a31.5 trillion industry and expect to be victorious straight away. The British Fashion Council estimates that \u00a3100m worth of orders are placed across these five days, which won\u2019t be passed up lightly. However, if the status quo remains unchallenged we all lose the war. Fashion\u2019s most successful coup is to distract us from the devastation and waste that lie in the wake of its beautiful designs. The statistics of environmental damage are staggering. This year, the UN reported that fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world.\n\nDespite controversy over this statistic, the impact of the industry is in little doubt. It is responsible for more carbon emissions than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. It takes around 7,500 litres of water to make a single pair of jeans. This is equivalent to the amount the average person drinks over seven years, yet we keep our clothes on average for just two years.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nTo fulfil our insatiable demand for new garments, more than 100 billion items are produced each year, most from virgin sources. And yet, 73 per cent of the 53 million tons of fibres used to make clothes and textiles are burnt or sent to landfill annually. So-called natural materials are not as harmless as we have been led to believe. Cotton, a thirsty crop grown with huge amounts of pesticides, is one of the primary causes of central Asia\u2019s Aral Sea \u2013 once the world\u2019s fourth-largest sea \u2013 drying up. Leather has been accused of being one of the causes of the 41,000 fires to ravage the Amazon so far this year.\n\nLook good and feel good with these sustainability promises Ask #WhoMadeMyClothes: every time you buy something drop the brand an email, or tag them in a Twitter or Instagram post to ask them who made your item. If you care, they will be forced to care. Make the 30-wear promise: join Emma Watson et al and only buy something if you will wear it a minimum of 30 times. Embrace vintage: shop in charity shops and on pre-loved sites and take part in clothes swaps beyond #SecondhandSeptember Consider materials: as a general guide the best materials are recycled \u2013 nylon, polyester, cotton and wool. Also top of the list are organic materials, especially linen and hemp but also cotton. New, great and increasingly popular fibres include Tencel (created from wood) and Monocel (from bamboo).\n\nSynthetic, or vegan, materials derived from the oil industry, fare no better for reasons of production and upkeep. Washing synthetic clothes contributes to the 500,000 tons of microfibres, equivalent to 3 million barrels of oil, being dumped into the ocean every year. Then there\u2019s our reluctance to be seen in the same outfit twice, which means a mammoth 11 million items of clothing end up in landfill each week.\n\nThanks to the rise of fast, or throwaway, fashion in the UK, we\u2019re now buying twice as many clothes than we did a decade ago and more than any other country in Europe. \u200b\n\n\u201cShoppers\u2019 high is a feeling everyone loves now and again \u2013 that thrill you get when you treat yourself to something new, even if it\u2019s just new to you,\u201d says Fee Gilfeather, a sustainable fashion expert from Oxfam, which is in the midst of its #SecondhandSeptember campaign. The charity is challenging people to not buy anything brand new for the month, in an attempt to divert items from landfill and profits to charity shops.\n\nRebranded as \u201cvintage\u201d, \u201cretro\u201d and \u201cpre-loved\u201d, the secondhand market\u2019s cool credentials are fast rising and sales are, too \u2013 offering a glimmer of hope. If it continues on this upward trend, the pre-loved market is predicted to be 50 per cent bigger than fast fashion in less than 10 years, according to GlobalData analysis for thredUP. Fashion lovers and professionals are also warming up to the idea of renting their wardrobes with peer-to-peer rental platforms starting to pop up and brands in the US even creating items exclusively for rental giant Rent the Runway.\n\n\u201cI was in Seattle for a conference earlier this year and practically every woman I stopped to ask about her outfit had gotten it from Rent the Runway. Everyone I know in the US is using it for not just formal dresses, but workwear and maternity clothes as well. It\u2019s about time we have the same concept here,\u201d says founder of Not My Style fashion app, Alisha Miranda.\n\nWhile the dream of having access to a constantly revolving wardrobe has great appeal, and is certainly more sustainable than only buying something and wearing it once, these platforms don\u2019t yet take into account where these clothes were made, or how. The human cost is arguably the most scandalous thing about fashion, and one that is too often weaved out of the sustainability story.\n\nRichest textile billionaires According to Forbes Bernaud Arnualt: \u00a376bn, portfolio includes Louis Vuitton Amancio Ortega: \u00a362.7bn, co-founder of Zara Phil Knight: \u00a333.4bn, founder of Nike\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make consumers feel sympathy for the plight of the women working in garment factories when they are not always much better protected themselves. It\u2019s much easier for us to feel outraged at other aspects linked to fashion, like waste or the burning of stock,\u201d explains Orsola de Castro, founder and creative director of Fashion Revolution. This is one of the reasons Burberry\u2019s burning of \u00a328m worth of luxury clothing made front-page news last year, while reports of bosses forcing female workers to commit sex acts to secure working contracts in factories making jeans for the likes of Levi, Wrangler and Lee, barely made the headlines last month.\n\nOne testimony said: \u201cAll of the women in my department have slept with the supervisor. For the women, this is about survival and nothing else. If you say no, you won\u2019t get the job, or your contract will not be renewed.\u201d The three factories in Lesotho, an independent country inside South Africa, are owned by the Taiwan-based global jeans manufacturer Nien Hsing Textile Co Ltd, and employ 10,000 people.\n\nNien Hsing stated no manager or supervisor had been disciplined for sexual harassment in the company since 2005, and attempted to deny the abuse. The Workers Right Consortium (WRC), which collected testimonials from 140 workers over 18 months, had a lot of evidence to dispute this. It also explicitly implicated other brands for their failure to detect these violations despite their supposed voluntary codes of conduct and monitoring programmes, which allowed the abuses to continue.\n\nIn the wake of Harvey Weinstein and all stories that continue to come out of the #MeToo movement, it\u2019s no longer excusable to say \u201cwe didn\u2019t know\u201d. But, when the burden of proof lies squarely on the shoulders of the victims, victims who have no platform from which to speak and are at huge risk of losing their job, it\u2019s too easy for brands to deny culpability. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital we allow all workers to be unionised to give them access to collective bargaining and support,\u201d says De Castro.\n\nTellingly, the WRC recommended these brands continue to buy their jeans from the factories because the loss of employment would be economically devastating to the workers. Instead, it recommends the brands use their leverage by reducing their orders if Nien Hsing doesn\u2019t stick to its new commitments. That\u2019s the power brands have to bring about change.\n\nFashion Revolution, founded six years ago after the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh, which killed 1,138 workers, reveals clothes are among the items most at risk of being produced through modern slavery. This assertion is supported by a recent report from the University of Sheffield that suggests shoppers are being duped by the Adidases, Zaras and Hugo Bosses of this world \u2013 proving that a higher price doesn\u2019t mean higher wages. It concludes supplier codes of conduct are rarely worth the paper they are written on.\n\n\u201cConsumers are purchasing products they believe are made by workers earning a living wage, when in reality, low wages continue to be the status quo across the global garment industry,\u201d says project leader Professor Genevieve LeBaron. In her new book, Fashionopolis, Dana Thomas says less than 2 per cent of garment workers are paid a living wage. Even buying clothes made in Britain doesn\u2019t guarantee fair wages, with reports of garment workers being paid \u00a34 an hour \u2013 less than half the minimum wage workers aged 25 and over are legally entitled to.\n\nThe lure of lower wages is ever-tempting, too. Ethiopia is the industry\u2019s new frontier, according to a report by Doroth\u00e9e Baumann-Pauly from NYU Stern\u2019s Centre for Business and Human Rights. The Ethiopian government is attempting to attract the fashion industry to its up-and-coming garment production hub, which employs 25,000 workers at an industrial park 140 miles south of Addis Ababa. The basic wage of \u00a320 a month is one of the biggest promises made to Asian suppliers and western buyers, despite this being 40 per cent less than the average income and barely enough to get by.\n\nFashion culture in the UK Source: Oxfam 90 per cent of British adults say they are bothered about the impact their shopping has on the environment. 53 per cent maintain they are unaware that fast fashion is damaging to the environment. 30 per cent admit although they are shocked at how much damage fast fashion has on the environment, they probably won\u2019t change their habits.\n\nComplex and frequently murky supply chains enable brands to drive down prices at each step, without taking responsibility for workers. \u201cCreating an item of clothing isn\u2019t as simple as its low cost implies,\u201d explains Katie Shaw, a stakeholder manager of the Open Apparel Registry (OAR), a fast-growing open-source map of names and addresses of garment facilities worldwide: 20,000 so far.\n\n\u201cThat \u2018Made in Vietnam\u2019 label in your top is only telling a tiny part of the story; where the product was finally cut and sewn. Think of all the steps before that, then throw in buyers and you\u2019re left with our globalised fashion system, where the process of creating one ordinary T-shirt can involve multiple shipments between different countries.\u201d She describes the OAR as a master \u201csource of truth\u201d for the industry and says the data is already being used by companies working to reinstate workers who\u2019ve been unfairly dismissed, or are owed back pay.\n\nProvenance is also working with fashion brands that want to be part of the transparency movement. Their blockchain technology helps brands to open up the supply chain and reveal the impact of products to shoppers. \u201cI see a huge opportunity for brands to appeal to shoppers looking to buy products that match their values,\u201d says founder Jessi Baker. \u201cFor us, the next frontier is transparency with integrity: we\u2019ve seen companies like Everlane show us their factories and some impact information, which is great, but with everyone opening up on information, brands will soon need to prove what they say.\u201d\n\nThe leading business event on sustainability in fashion, the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year. Its strategic partners include H&M, Nike and the Kering Group (which owns Gucci and YSL). It\u2019s practically the same list of people who signed the G7 Fashion Pact in Biarritz, promising to shift to a more sustainable future, just last month. \u201cWe are taking our responsibility through collective action and common objectives,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault (reported to be worth \u00a328.3bn), chairman and chief executive of Kering.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing new, we\u2019ve seen everything they\u2019ve said before,\u201d says Fashion Revolution\u2019s De Castro. \u201cEven the simplest thing to do, eliminating single-use plastic, is non-compulsory and the deadline for that is 2030. This should be actioned today. If the situation wasn\u2019t so serious, reading it would make me laugh.\u201d\n\nDespite brands\u2019 best intentions, the Global Fashion Agenda\u2019s report, The Pulse, states that in terms of environmental impact, progress has slowed by a third compared with the growth of the sector. A damning analysis from the Union of Concerned Researchers into Fashion sums the situation up: \u201cSo far, the mission has been an utter failure and all small and incremental changes have been drowned by an explosive economy of extraction, consumption, waste and continuous labour abuse\u2026 it is important to stress that the industry has spent 30 years trying to fix the old system, and it is getting worse, not better.\u201d\n\nWithout radical action, by 2050 the global textile industry will be accountable for a quarter of all carbon emissions. The radical, but very simple, first step is to produce and consume less.\n\nLizzie Rivera is the founder of ethical lifestyle site BICBIM", "description": "September is always show time in fashion; the month to obsess over the trends of front-row celebrities as well as the catwalk.\u00a0This year, it\u2019s also showdown time.", "authors": ["Lizzie Rivera"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/12/clothes-pile.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
