(AP) - Adding speed to the defense to match up with Kansas City\u2019s dynamic playmakers was a priority this offseason for the Oakland Raiders.\n\nFor one dizzying stretch in the second quarter the improved defense couldn\u2019t catch up, leading to four long touchdown passes by Patrick Mahomes that sent Oakland to a 28-10 loss to Kansas City on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHe was the MVP for a reason,\u201d Raiders cornerback Daryl Worley said. \u201cHe made some hell of a (good) throws. We\u2019ve got to be better in situations like that and be able to make those plays on the ball.\u201d\n\nThe Raiders started fast, forcing punts on the opening two drives for the first scoreless opening quarter of Mahomes\u2019 19 career starts. They finished OK by keeping the Chiefs off the scoreboard in the second half for the first time in Mahomes\u2019 career as well.\n\nThe second quarter was a thing of nightmares as Chiefs receivers burned past defenders, exploited blown coverages and capitalized when Mahomes was able to extend plays in the pocket.\n\nIt added up to 278 yards passing - the most in any quarter in nearly 11 years - the four touchdowns, and one stretch that included five straight attempts that went for at least 27 yards. Three of those went for touchdowns.\n\n\u201cWe had a breakdown in one coverage, I know that, but a couple of those were just incredible throws and catches also,\u201d coach Jon Gruden said. \u201cYou have to tip your hat to them. We didn\u2019t get enough pressure. We let Mahomes move around back there, cock his arm. And when he gets an opportunity to do that he can drop them in there no matter where they are.\u201d\n\nThe breakdown came on the first touchdown when Demarcus Robinson sped through the secondary and was all alone for a 44-yard score on the first play in the second quarter.\n\nKansas City didn\u2019t slow down from there, scoring on two straight drives of more than 90 yards, with Mahomes finding rookie Mecole Hardman on a 42-yards strike and Travis Kelce on a 27-yarder that made it 21-10.\n\nThe Raiders then went three-and-out late in the half, setting the stage for the fourth TD on a 39-yard pass from Mahomes to Robinson, who thrived as the Oakland defense paid more attention to Kelce and Sammy Watkins with speedster Tyreek Hill out with an injury.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a great arm and they\u2019ve got a lot of weapons. Up front, we have to get home,\u201d rookie defensive end Maxx Crosby said. \u201cThat\u2019s basically it. The back end can only hold up for so long. We just have to keep getting pressure. They had a second quarter where they started throwing the ball deep and they won some 50-50 balls. That\u2019s on us up front. We\u2019ve got to get home.\u201d\n\nThe poor defensive quarter was even more costly because the offense stalled after scoring 10 points on the opening two drives. Derek Carr looked crisp early, leading the Raiders to a field goal and then throwing a 4-yard TD pass to Tyrell Williams on the second drive to make it 10-0.\n\nThe Raiders didn\u2019t score again, gaining two first downs on four drives during the Kansas City barrage, and then throwing two interceptions in the third quarter to end any comeback attempt.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when we couldn\u2019t get a first down and they jumped up on us, and then that changes a whole bunch of stuff,\u201d Carr said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Adding speed to the defense to match up with Kansas City's dynamic playmakers was a priority this offseason for the Oakland Raiders.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/chiefs_raiders_football_43478_c0-125-3000-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?f52fad753beb582a85b1710fc9f6c2ec1ddbd99f", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
