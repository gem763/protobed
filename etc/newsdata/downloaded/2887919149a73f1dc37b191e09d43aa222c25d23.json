We fought ISIS but at the end the Americans deserted us.\"\n\nHe was among the tens of thousands of Arab and Kurdish civilians who have been forced to flee homes in the area bordering Turkey in northeastern Syria, according to the United Nations.\n\nMany have traveled south and deeper into Syria, while more than 7,000 mainly-Kurdish civilians have gone to Iraqi Kurdistan,according to the U.N.\n\nMany ethnic Kurds in northeastern Syria feel betrayed by the U.S.'s withdrawal, which has left them more vulnerable to the Turkish offensive that is due to restart at 10 p.m. local time Tuesday (3 p.m. E.T.)\n\nRanda Shekhums Hussein and her family fled from al Darbasiyah, just east of Ras Al-Ayn, to Dohuk earlier in the week.

We didn't have time to bring anything,\" said Randa Shekhmus Hussein, 29, a mother of three.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have beencrucial U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic Stategroup and some are still working with the U.S. to defend oilfields from ISIS and other militants in northeast Syria amid the chaos caused by Turkish bombardment.\n\nMechanic, Mustafa Ramadan, described it as a betrayal.\n\nBaradarash Refugee Camp in Iraqi Kurdistan is sheltering thousands of Syrian refugees who fled the recent fighting. Yuka Tachibana\n\n\"Everything is finished. My house has been destroyed by the shelling,\" said a 45-year-old speaking inside the barbed-wire fence of the refugee camp.\n\n\"In a flash, everything is gone.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to pull out most of the some 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria has left a diplomatic and military vacuum in the region that is swiftly being filled by Moscow.\n\nTrump's move also left the fate of the Kurds largely in the hands of Russia's Vladimr Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who were due to meet in Sochi, Russia, on Tuesday \u2014 hours before the suspension in fighting was set to end.\n\nDespite withering domestic and international criticism, Trump has defended his decision.\n\n\"We never agreed to protect the Kurds,\"he told reporters Monday. \"We fought with them for three-and-a-half to four years, we never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nMatt Bradley and Yuka Tachibana reported from Duhok, Iraq.
