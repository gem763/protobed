At least that\u2019s what the World Civilisation Research Association, a group made up of Chinese scholars and professors, would like us to believe, reports state. They say this claim is backed by over 20 years of research, which were presented at the first ever China International Frontier Education Summit in Beijing in July.\n\nIn a an interview with Sina News, World Civilisation Research Association Vice President and Secretary-General Zhai Guiyun said: \u201cOf course, the pronunciation will be a little different, which is caused by the variations in pronunciation over hundreds or even thousands of years in different regions. Think about how significant the differences are in our regional dialects\u2026 so it can be said that English is like a \u2018dialect\u2019 in our country.\u201d\n\nZhai continued to say that the autumn leaves are \u201cyellow,\u201d an English word that is pronounced like the Mandarin word \u201cyeluo,\u201d which means \u201cleaf drop.\u201d Another example he gave was the world \u201cheart,\u201d which sounds like the Mandarin word \u201chede,\u201d which means \u201ccore.\u201d Zhai went on to explain that there are hundreds of words with such similarities. He even went on to say that French, German, and Russian also root from Mandarin.\n\nApart from language, the organisation claimed that Western civilisation also originated in China. They say this is backed by Zhai Du Gangjian, a professor who supposedly conducted 20 years of research that shows how the civilisations that first spoke English came from the Indus River Valley when China\u2019s Yellow Emperor ruled it.\n\nPerhaps that wildest among the scholars\u2019 statements is one that claims that accounts on ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt were all fabricated.\n\n\u201cBefore the 15th and 16th centuries, Europe had no history, only myths and legends,\u201d Zhai said. He continued to explain that \u201cEurope was a primitive society before the Middle Ages,\u201d but this allegedly changed after the \u201cWestern introduction to China\u2019s Zhou Dynasty.\u201d\n\nThe World Civilisation Research Association\u2019s findings led many Chinese netizens to scratch their heads. Many users of the Chinese social media platform Weibo called the organisation \u201cWolf Warrior Scholars,\u201d a reference to a patriotic Chinese film.\n\n\u201cThanks, we can no longer laugh at the Koreans who claimed Confucius and Genghis Khan are Korean,\u201d another said.", "description": "They also say that Western civilisation originated in China and that accounts of ancient Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians are all fake.", "authors": ["Gavin Butler", "Caleb Quinley", "Sarah Ngu"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d75fdced412b700085a4b8f/lede/1568015056196-chuttersnap-aku7Zlj_x_o-unsplash.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8416xh;0xw,0.1584xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
