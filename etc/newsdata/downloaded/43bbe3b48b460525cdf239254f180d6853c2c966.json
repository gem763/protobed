Smokey Bear just turned 75 years old, and there have been parties around the country for the fire prevention icon. And maybe that's what the black bear in Estes Park, Colo., was celebrating when it broke into a home on Friday night. Police say it came in through a door. But when an officer arrived, it chose a different exit. Police describe the animal less like Smokey and more like the Kool-Aid Man - crashing through a wall, leaving a bear-sized hole in its wake.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.
