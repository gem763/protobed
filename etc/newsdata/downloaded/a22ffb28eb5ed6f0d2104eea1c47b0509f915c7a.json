She shot 57% from the field in the five-game series and scored at least 20 points in six of Washington\u2019s nine playoff games.\n\nThe league\u2019s best player endured not one, not two, but three herniated disks in her back during the Finals.\n\nElena Delle Donne, the 2015 and 2019 WNBA MVP, said it felt like she had a pole up her back but still had 21 points, nine rebounds, two assists and two blocks in the decisive game of the series.\n\n\"Have I told you lately that I love you?\"\n\n\n\n\u2014@De11eDonne on what she said in her coach's ear moments after winning her first WNBA title pic.twitter.com/e5HvuKf0n8 \u2014 SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) October 11, 2019\n\nOh, it took more than those three for the Mystics to win the title. Kristi Toliver put a shaky start behind her and finished with 18 points. Natasha Cloud missed four 3-pointers in the first half but made two in the second half and finished with 18 points.\n\n\"One of the best things about this team is the camaraderie and the family atmosphere on this team,\" Thibault said. \"They love each other. They played for each other. When we had our toughest moment tonight in the third quarter, we banded together, played like we had all year.\"\n\nThe 69-year-old coach is a basketball lifer, starting his coaching career in 1980 as an assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers where he was part of two championship teams. He has friends all over the NBA and attends Wizards games to catch up with coaches. He was an assistant with Chicago and Milwaukee and won a championship in the Continental Basketball Association.\n\nHe moved to the WNBA in 2002, spending 10 years with Connecticut. He earned WNBA Coach of the Year honors twice and reached the Finals twice, losing both times. He was fired in 2012.\n\n\"One phrase that was given to me by somebody in the organization at the time I got fired was that I owed them a championship,\" Thibault said. \"I got mine first.\"\n\nThe @WashMystics head coach Mike Thibault talks with @sportsiren on how his squad was able to get it done on the BIGGEST stage! \ud83d\udc4f#WNBApic.twitter.com/EwVZfSM8lr \u2014 WNBA (@WNBA) October 11, 2019\n\nThibault got married in 1982 after the Lakers\u2019 championship; his son, Eric, a Mystics assistant coach, is getting married next week.\n\n\"Next week at his wedding, we\u2019re going to put the trophy in the middle of the whole thing, too,\" Thibault said.\n\nThe Mystics drafted Meesseman in 2013, but after having played non-stop basketball in American and Europe for five consecutive seasons, she sat out the 2018 WNBA season to rest.\n\nWhen she returned in 2019, she was labeled the missing piece who could propel the Mystics to a title after they lost in the 2018 Finals without her.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t view herself as the missing piece.\n\n\"These playoffs were the moment that I really realized I have to take my responsibility and I can play,\" she said. \"I've never really believed that because I know last year I would not be the same player this year. I just think that I really needed that break and to be home. So I would not have been able to bring what I brought now.\u201d\n\nShe averaged 17.8 points in the five-game series, and when Washington needed someone to score in the second half Thursday, she was the one. She had 11 points in the third quarter, and she did it in a six-minute stretch that helped cut Connecticut\u2019s nine-point lead to 64-62 heading into the fourth.\n\n\"The way she played tonight in the moments that she wanted the ball in the biggest moments, and a couple years ago she didn't,\" Toliver said. \"And so that's a huge credit to her and her growth as a player and a person.\"\n\nDelle Donne played in the 2014 Finals with Chicago and lost, and played in the 2018 Finals and lost. In 2014, she was slowed by a bad back, last season a bone bruise and another back issue in these Finals.\n\n\"I've contemplated long hours over why every time I get to a Finals something happens, and I think it's because I pissed the basketball gods off years ago when I decided to step away,\" she said. \"So I'm hoping this ends this little drama that I've been having in the Finals.\"\n\nDelle Donne scored 11 points in the second half, including six in the fourth quarter.\n\nShe wanted a trade from Chicago so she could closer to her Delaware home and her sister, Lizzie, who was born deaf, blind and with cerebral palsy and autism. The Mystics acquired Delle Donne in 2017.\n\n\"Lizzie has been my journey, and some people have never understood my decisions. Others have. But she's been my path, and somehow she's gotten me to this moment,\" Delle Donne said. \"Another reason I can battle through injury is she's been dealt the worst cards possible with her disabilities, and every day she gets up, she smiles, she laughs, she loves. So she's always just been my inspiration.\"\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.", "description": "Head coach Mike Thibault, star Elena Delle Donne and Finals MVP Emma Meeseman guided the Mystics to the first WNBA championship in franchise history.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published A.M.
