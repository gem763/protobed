Researchers have projected that 8 million people in the U.S. will be affected by AFib this year, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages.\n\n\u201cWith our continuous, 24-7 on-wrist health tracking capabilities, and our experience delivering personalized, engaging software and services, we believe we can develop content to help bridge the gaps that exist in atrial fibrillation detection, encouraging people to visit their doctor for a prompt diagnosis and potentially reduce their risk of stroke.\u201d\n\nAFib can develop without showing symptoms, and studies have suggested that more than 25 percent of people with AFib find out they have it after suffering a stroke. The Bristol-Meyers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance will also work with Fitbit to develop educational content for people at increased risk of AFib, the companies announced.\n\nFitbit wouldn\u2019t be the first tech company to add AFib detection to its devices. Series 4 Apple Watches added heart readings last year, and the company worked with Stanford Medicine to test the accuracy of the devices and found that they could detect AFib. They found that about 0.5 percent of study participants received an \u201cirregular heart rhythm warning,\u201d and 34 percent of those who followed up with doctors were found to have the condition.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Fitbit is targeting Apple with its next offering.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/fitbit-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
