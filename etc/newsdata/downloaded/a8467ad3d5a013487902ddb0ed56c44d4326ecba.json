Protests should be peaceful.\"\n\nTorra's comments came after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez on Wednesday called on the Catalan leader to \"clearly condemn\" the violent riots, which erupted in response the Spanish Supreme Court's decision on Monday to sentence 12 Catalan separatist leaders to up to 13 years in jail for their role in a failed bid for Catalan independence in 2017.\n\nDemonstrations began hours after the verdict was announced on Monday, with some 10,000 protesters swarming Barcelona's airport, causing more than 100 flights to be canceled.
