Its MPs are notorious for disrupting sessions of the National Assembly by lobbing tear gas. The LDK is Kosovo's oldest party - and hopes to install lawyer Vjosa Osmani as the first female prime minister.\n\nThe two parties failed to reach a coalition agreement before the election - and may take many weeks of negotiations to form a new government.\n\nMeanwhile, the former leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army are licking their electoral wounds. Voters held their parties largely responsible for endemic corruption and a lack of development.\n\nMr Haradinaj's party meanwhile is set to win only 10% of the vote.\n\nThe 51-year-old served as a rebel commander in the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, which eventually led to Kosovo declaring independence.\n\nMr Haradinaj stepped down so that he could attend court as an ordinary citizen - but was free to stand for re-election because no indictments have yet been announced.\n\nHe denies war crimes and has been tried and acquitted twice before at the UN tribunal.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The LDK hopes Vjosa Osmani will become Kosovo's first female prime minister\n\nLast year, he imposed a 100% tariff on imports from Serbia last November in retaliation for Belgrade blocking Kosovo's membership of international organisations.\n\nHe has ignored pleas from Brussels to revoke the tariffs.\n\nMr Kurti has said his party will abolish the tariffs but will introduce other retaliatory measures against Serbia.\n\nMeanwhile Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic says Belgrade will hold talks with the Kosovan government once the tariffs have been removed.\n\nOn Thursday US President Donald Trump appointed the US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, as special envoy for peace negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia.\n\nKosovo is recognised by most of the west but it needs Belgrade, Russia and China to accept its statehood to get a seat in the United Nations.", "description": "The poll was called after the country's prime minister resigned to appear at a war crimes court.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F66/production/_109124930_mediaitem109124929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
