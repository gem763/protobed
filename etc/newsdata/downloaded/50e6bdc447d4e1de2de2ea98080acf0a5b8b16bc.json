We are calling on Turkey to stand down, end the violence and come to the negotiating table,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told reporters.\n\nTrump also announced plans to reimpose steel tariffs on Turkey and immediately halt negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal.\n\nRussia-backed Syrian forces on Monday took rapid advantage of the abrupt U.S. retreat in Syria to deploy deep inside territory held by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces south of the Turkish frontier. Washington had announced plans for a full withdrawal from northern Syria less than 24 hours earlier.\n\nWashington\u2019s Kurdish former allies said they invited in the government troops as an emergency step to help fend off the Turkish assault, launched on Wednesday after what the Kurds called a U.S. betrayal.\n\nThe Syrian army deployment is a victory for President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally Russia, giving them a foothold in the biggest remaining swathe of the country that had been beyond their grasp.\n\nThey will now face Turkish armed forces along a new front line hundreds of miles long.\n\nSyrian state media reported the army entered Manbij, a town that had been controlled by a militia allied to the Kurds. Earlier it pushed into Tel Tamer, a town on the strategically important M4 highway that runs east-west around 30 km (19 miles) south of the frontier with Turkey.\n\nState television later showed residents welcoming Syrian forces into the town of Ain Issa, which lies on another part of the highway, hundreds of miles away.\n\nAin Issa commands the northern approaches to Raqqa, former capital of the Islamic State \u201ccaliphate\u201d, which Kurdish fighters recaptured from the militants two years ago in one of the biggest victories of a U.S.-led campaign.\n\nMuch of the M4 skirts the southern fringe of territory where Turkey aims to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria. Turkey said it had seized part of the highway. An official of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said clashes were ongoing.\n\nU.S. STRATEGY UNRAVELING\n\nThe swift Syrian government deployments underscored how suddenly the strategy the United States had pursued in Syria for the past five years has unraveled. Washington announced on Sunday it was pulling out its entire force of 1,000 troops which had provided air support, ground assistance and training for Syrian Kurds against Islamic State since 2014.\n\nTrump said U.S. troops would remain at a small garrison at Tanf in southern Syria \u201cto continue to disrupt remnants\u201d of Islamic State. But the base would do little to support operations elsewhere in the country.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, better known for his backing of Trump, joined his critics to express concern over the Syria pullout, saying it would \u201cinvite the resurgence\u201d of Islamic State.\n\n\u201cSuch a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States\u2019 strategic interests,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nA U.S. official said on Monday a diplomatic team working to help stabilise territory captured from Islamic State had already pulled out. U.S. troops were still on the ground but early phases of their withdrawal had started, the official said.\n\nTwo other U.S. officials have told Reuters the bulk of the U.S. pullout could be completed within days.\n\nU.S. PARTNERS\n\nThousands of fighters from a Kurdish-led force have died since 2014 battling Islamic State in partnership with the United States, a strategy the Trump administration had continued after inheriting it from his predecessor Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cAfter the Americans abandoned the region and gave the green light for the Turkish attack, we were forced to explore another option, which is talks with Damascus and Moscow to find a way out and thwart these Turkish attacks,\u201d senior Kurdish official Badran Jia Kurd said. Jia Kurd described the new arrangement with Assad\u2019s forces as a \u201cpreliminary military agreement\u201d, and said political aspects would be discussed later.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the Kurds will be treated now. Kurdish fighters began carving out autonomous rule in Syria\u2019s northeast early in its eight-year-old war, benefiting from diversions of Assad\u2019s military to fight elsewhere. Assad aims to restore his government\u2019s authority across all of the country.\n\nSenior Kurdish politician Aldar Xelil called the pact with Damascus \u201can emergency measure\u201d. \u201cThe priority now is protecting the border\u2019s security from the Turkish danger.\u201d\n\nA Syrian army soldier is seen in the town of Tel Tamer in northeast Syria, in this handout released by SANA on October 14, 2019.

REUTERS IS UNABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THIS IMAGE.\n\nTrump says he aims to extract the United States from \u201cendless\u201d wars in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter earlier on Monday. \u201cI hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nNEW FRONT LINE\n\nAnkara says it aims to defeat the Kurdish YPG militia which it views as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish separatists in Turkey. A \u201csafe zone\u201d would be set up in Syria to resettle refugees, 3.6 million of whom are in Turkey.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to continue the operation until the end, without paying attention to threats,\u201d Erdogan said in a speech during a visit to Azerbaijan. \u201cOur battle will continue until ultimate victory is achieved.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish Defence Ministry said 560 militants had been \u201cneutralised\u201d since the operation began. Earlier, Erdogan said 500 militants had been killed, 26 surrendered and 24 were wounded so far.\n\nThe U.S. exit leaves Turkey and Russia, as well as Iran, Assad\u2019s main Middle East ally, as Syria\u2019s undisputed foreign power brokers. Ankara and Moscow both predicted they would avoid conflict in Syria, even as the front line between them will now spread across the breadth of the country.\n\n\u201cThere are many rumours at the moment. However, especially through the embassy and with the positive approach of Russia in Kobani, it appears there won\u2019t be any issues,\u201d Erdogan said when asked about the prospect of confrontation with Russia.\n\nKobani, on the Turkish border, is one of the first Kurdish-held cities where reports emerged of possible Syrian government deployment. Pence said Erdogan gave his assurance to Trump that Turkey would not attack Kobani.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the suggestion that Russia could clash with Turkish forces. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even like to think of that scenario,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fighting has raised concerns that the Kurds would be unable to keep thousands of Islamic State fighters in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe region\u2019s Kurdish-led administration said 785 Islamic State-affiliated foreigners escaped a camp at Ain Issa over the weekend. The British-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing sources in the camp, said the number who escaped was smaller, around 100.\n\nEU countries have threatened to impose sanctions on Turkey over the assault. But at a meeting on Monday they agreed not to impose an embargo. Member countries would instead consider their own restrictions on sales of weapons, a measure likely to be brushed off as trivial, as arms account for just 45 million euros out of more than 150 billion euros in Turkey-EU trade.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he would call on NATO allies to \u201ctake collective and individual\u201d actions against Turkey when he meets defense chiefs in Brussels next week.\n\nRepublican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. Congress have announced plans to impose their own sanctions. Turkey\u2019s trade with the United States is a fraction of its trade with Europe.", "description": "President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Turkey on Monday and demanded the NATO ally stop a military incursion in northeast Syria that is rapidly reshaping the battlefield of the world's deadliest ongoing war.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440838507&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1P9", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
