Even something like the Apple Watch, which is usually safe on your wrist, can be lost. You come home from a run, pull off your watch and drop it \u2014 somewhere in the living room. The band comes loose while you\u2019re out watching the latest Marvel movie, and you walk out of the theater without it. Your three-year-old decides it might be fun to play with your Watch for a few minutes, and then leaves it under a pile of stuffed toys.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nLuckily, Apple\u2019s \u201cFind My\u201d app works as well with your Watch as with your iPhone \u2014 better, in fact, because you can use your iPhone to find your wandering Watch.\n\nGo to the Watch app on your phone. (You can also get there by tapping on the \u201cFind My\u201d app and choosing your watch from the list of devices.)\n\nTap on your watch\u2019s name\n\nTap on the information circle to the right of the watch name / photo\n\nTap on \u201cFind My Apple Watch.\u201d (If this is the first time you\u2019ve used the feature, you may be requested to turn on \u201cSend Last Location,\u201d which will store the last known location of your Watch for up to 24 hours after the battery has run out.)\n\nThe next page has a map that shows you the location of your watch and several options for finding your device.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the watch is somewhere close (for example, if you lost it somewhere within your house), you can tap \u201cPlay Sound\u201d to have it play an increasingly loud sound. (It will also tap against your wrist, just in case you forgot you\u2019re wearing it.) You can then dismiss the sound using the watch once you\u2019ve found it.\n\nYou can get directions to its current (or last) location.\n\nYou can mark the phone as lost. When you do that, you will be guided through a series of screens that will let you set a passcode for the lost watch, set a phone number (if you want to) so you can be notified if it\u2019s found, and create a message (\u201cPlease call me if you find this watch\u201d). Once the feature is activated, the watch will be locked, and whoever finds it won\u2019t be able to use it without the passcode.\n\nIf the phone is marked as lost, when you tap on the \u201cMark as Lost\u201d section you will be taken to a \u201cLost Mode\u201d page, which lets you receive email updates or turn off \u201cMark as Lost.\u201d\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re sure that the watch has been stolen, you can tap on \u201cErase This Device.\u201d You\u2019ll get a screen asking if you want to erase the device and warning you that an erased watch can no longer be tracked. However, you can still enter an optional phone number screen (as when you marked it as lost) and a message for someone who recovers it.", "description": "Apple\u2019s \"Find My\" app works as well with your Watch as with your iPhone \u2014 better, in fact, because you can use your iPhone to find your wandering Watch.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AYRI34hOdoJUMW_oDLCOT2KeSZY=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13111167/vpavic_180917_2949_0025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
