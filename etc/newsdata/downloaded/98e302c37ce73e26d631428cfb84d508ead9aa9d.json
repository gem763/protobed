But we\u2019re surviving.\u201d\n\nFarther north at Florida\u2019s Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach and Neptune Beach, alcohol sales in bars and grocery stores were banned.\n\nLocal officials had grown concerned that beach community residents were too complacent about hurricane warnings, according to The Florida Times-Union. The towns also had a legacy of residents refusing to evacuate during severe weather.\n\nBut just west of Jacksonville Beach, stores reported heavy sales of alcohol sales Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re booming,\u201d said Laura Moreno, an employee at Classic Wine and Spirits in the city of Jacksonville. \u201cPeople want to stock up and watch the storm. They come in and grab some gin.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia and South Carolina coasts were busy evacuating Wednesday, as meteorologists predicted Dorian would arrive and trigger flash flooding.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center forecast storm surges of 3 to 6 feet, with rainfall totals reaching as much as 15 inches.\n\nThe picturesque harbor city of Charleston, South Carolina, had emptied out. A local ABC News affiliate showed empty downtown streets and reported that officials were estimating 360,000 evacuees were on the move in the state.\n\nNearby Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort and Parris Island recruit depot also were being evacuated.\n\nStars and Stripes reported that in 26 U.S. warships had departed from the world\u2019s largest naval base, Naval Station Norfolk, with more evacuations from Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek.\n\nShips re to remain at sea until the threat from the storm subsides, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic spokeswoman Beth Baker was quoted as saying.\n\nMeanwhile in the Bahamas, rescue and recovery efforts were struggling to deal with ruined airports after the storm hovered over the island nation from Sunday to Tuesday \u2014 at times with winds topping 185 mph, storm surges and at least seven deaths.\n\n\u201cWe can expect more deaths to be recorded,\u201d Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said Wednesday, according to CNN. \u201cOur priority is search, rescue and recovery.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Dorian is one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
