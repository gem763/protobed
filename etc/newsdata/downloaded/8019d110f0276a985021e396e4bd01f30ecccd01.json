Johnson's aides had also publicly denied a suspension was planned three days before it was finally announced.\n\nO'Neill said Johnson had failed to provide a sworn legal statement to the court, adding the prime minister was \"unable to tell the truth\" and that his political life was characterised by \"incontinent mendacity\".\n\nThe government's lawyer David Johnston said the issue was a political matter which should not be decided in the courts and there was no law which defined the use of prorogation.\n\nThe lawmakers behind the case want the court to order that parliament cannot be suspended and the judge's decision is expected on Wednesday.\n\nThe case is one of three legal bids to stop the prorogation with one challenge led by Gina Miller, who successfully forced former Prime Minister Theresa May to get parliamentary approval before formally giving the divorce notice to the EU, due before London's High Court on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison)", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was looking to suspend parliament two weeks before this month's planned shutdown was officially announced, a court was told on Tuesday.
