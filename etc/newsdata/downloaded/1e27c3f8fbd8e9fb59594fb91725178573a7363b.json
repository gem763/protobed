REUTERS/Aly Song\n\n(Reuters) - World number four Daniil Medvedev said on Wednesday that he would return to action in Vienna next week after pulling out of the ongoing Kremlin Cup in Moscow due to exhaustion.\n\nU.S. Open runner-up Medvedev lifted his fourth title of the season at the Shanghai Masters on Sunday, easing past Alexander Zverev 6-4 6-1, but the 23-year-old Russian said contesting his sixth consecutive final had taken a toll on his mind and body.\n\n\u201cI feel that I\u2019m physically and mentally exhausted. I can\u2019t be 100%. As a professional, I cannot step on court knowing that I\u2019m not 100% ready to play,\u201d Medvedev, who has already qualified for next month\u2019s season-ending ATP Finals, told the ATP website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad, because I really wanted to play in Moscow in front of my home crowd... it\u2019s professional sport and I must do what\u2019s best for my body.
