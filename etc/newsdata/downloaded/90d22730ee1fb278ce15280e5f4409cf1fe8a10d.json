It\u2019s fair to chuckle at Democratic expense, but after all, life is full of such ironies. Perverse realities may justify a certain tragic outlook but not utter paralysis in the face of possibly perverted justice.\n\nConservatives certainly have a right to demand strong evidence, in the form of open congressional testimony rather than anonymous leaks to the media. They\u2019re not entitled to adopt radical skepticism, in which it\u2019s impossible to ever know anything at all for certain, and therefore safe to ignore any messenger who brings unwelcome news. Nasty surprises may await when reality finally pierces the carefully curated fantasy.\n\nHowever, the bigger danger for conservatives is a different philosophical blunder, known as the sorites paradox. Attributed to Eubulides of Miletus, a contemporary of Aristotle, the paradox involves a heap of sand. And what is a heap? If we put one grain of sand on another, is that a heap? Obviously not. And if we add another grain, is it now a heap?\n\nAdding a single grain of sand shouldn\u2019t by itself turn a non-heap into a heap. But repeat the single-grain procedure enough times, and something suspiciously heap-like will result. At some point we\u2019d be fools to keep insisting, with each addition, nope, still not a heap.\n\nSo far, conservatives have been saved from this fate by the #Resistance rushes to judgment. Though Trump scandals inevitably stir Watergate comparisons, so far, they\u2019ve almost exactly inverted the Ur-Scandal. Watergate was a minor burglary that escalated into a presidential resignation precisely because each successive revelation was worse than the last. With Trump, by contrast, the left followed a variation on the strategy of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Queen of Hearts in \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d \u2014 \u201cSentence first \u2014 verdict afterwards.\u201d And so we began a couple of years ago by hearing that Trump had indubitably committed high treason and finished by establishing that some of his campaign staff had dabbled in campaign finance violations and tax fraud.\n\nThe Ukraine story is the first to actually follow the Watergate pattern \u2014 thus far. If we end up finding out that the worst is true one tiny revelation at a time, conservatives may be tempted to meet each incremental discovery with \u201cThat one fact can\u2019t establish a high crime or misdemeanor\u201d . . . until they have slowly backed into defending what they would never have countenanced at the start.\n\nSo this seems a good time for them to ask themselves a question: Where do they draw the line with Trump?\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to remain skeptical now, but at some point it may not be. What then? Unreasonably endorse using taxpayer money to blackmail foreign governments into messing with U.S. elections? If that\u2019s where we end up with Trump (today still very much an \u201cif\u201d), will conservatives risk the cost to their country of legitimizing shameless corruption, the moral and reputational cost of pretzeling their own principles, and the risk of political blowback from an American public that might just be naive enough to care?\n\nOf course, Democrats have their own conundrums to resolve, starting with the fact that Trump may well want to be impeached. More worrisome is their own eagerness for the fray. After so many years of waiting, they\u2019re ready for Impeachment Now! \u2014 yesterday, in fact. And thus they risk repeating the very Queen of Hearts strategy that taught conservatives to assume it would always get easier over time to defend the president, rather than harder.\n\nDemocratic leadership failed to convince the base that what they really want is not impeachment, but political advantage \u2014 or at least a decisive repudiation of the past three years \u2014 rather than a failed Senate trial that only reinforces the current political division.\n\nThe best way to get there is probably Impeachment Later \u2014 a thoughtful pause that would give conservatives time for soul-searching, and the heap of evidence time to grow. But after stalling the base for so long, House Democrats are probably too exhausted to hold out that much longer.\n\nTwitter: @asymmetricinfo\n\nRead more from Megan McArdle\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nMegan McArdle: When will Trump supporters finally say, \u2018Okay, this is not normal\u2019?\n\nRobert Kagan: If we legitimize Trump\u2019s behavior, it\u2019ll be open season on our politics\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Congress, don\u2019t fall into this trap\n\nMike Murphy: I\u2019m a Republican.
