And McCormick, who played Marcia Brady, insisted they really were like family when cameras stopped rolling.\n\n\u201cI have a real love for gardening and gardens and being outdoors and Bob had a beautiful place in Pasadena and the most beautiful rose gardens,\u201d the 63-year-old recently told Closer Weekly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because my backyard is filled with roses now and I always think of him and there was one rose that had been at the Brady house when we first got there \u2014 it was taken out of the ground and put in a really special place, just right outside the family room to celebrate Bob which was so special,\" she shared.\n\nPeople magazine previously reported Reed took pride in his work, especially as an actor who studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and later made his mark in theater. Therefore, he wasn\u2019t afraid to voice his opinions concerning the \u201cBrady Bunch\u201d scripts.\n\n'BRADY BUNCH' STAR MAUREEN MCCORMICK REMEMBERS HER TV MOM FLORENCE HENDERSON\n\nHe would fire off sarcastic memos to Sherwood Schwartz, the show\u2019s creator, as well as change the dialogue. But when he was truly frustrated with the quality of the scripts he would head \u201coff to an Irish pub near the Paramount studio\u201d to down three Scotches.\n\n\u201cI should have tried to get out of the show rather than inflict my views on them,\u201d he admitted to the outlet before he died. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m glad we did it. But I do not want it on my tombstone.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, Florence Henderson, who played Reed\u2019s on-screen wife Carol Brady, told the Miami Herald that the show embarrassed Reed, who had threatened to quit.\n\n\u201cHe thought we should be doing Shakespeare,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI would say, \u2018Bob, this is just a sitcom.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, Reed never forgot his TV family and even kept them in mind as he was dying.\n\n'BRADY BUNCH' STAR MAUREEN MCCORMICK SLAMS ANTI-VAXXERS\n\n\u201cHe called me and said, \u2018Florence, I\u2019m not going to make it. It would mean so much if you would tell the kids,\u2019\u201d Henderson recalled. \u201cEach one I told and we were all crying.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, McCormick also told Closer Weekly that Henderson, who passed away in 2016 at age 82 from heart failure, was on her mind.\n\n\u201cThe biggest life lessons I have learned came from Florence, and that was, being able to find joy like in a big way,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI mean, I spent a lot of time with her before she passed away. And I truly believe she taught me so much about finding joy and I feel such joy again in my life. You know, I\u2019ve gone through so many different things in my life\u2026 pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nThe former child star revealed another lesson she learned from Henderson.\n\nTHE SPECIAL WAY MAUREEN MCCORMICK IS HONORING HER TV MOM FLORENCE HENDERSON\n\n\u201cBe around positive, good people that lift you up, that doesn\u2019t tear you down, but just want to nurture you and you want to nurture them and you all work together,\u201d McCormick explained. \u201cYou know, I think that\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\n\u201cInclusion for everyone to me is a huge life lesson,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd one thing my father always told me was to find the love and to look for love in each and every human being. And I think that\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\nJust three days before her death, Henderson attended a taping of ABC\u2019s \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d to cheer on McCormick, who was participating in the dance competition series.\n\n\u201c[Florence was] a person who wanted to spread love and laughter,\u201d said McCormick on her friend to Fox News in 2017. \u201cShe loved people, she loved life. She\u2019s born on Valentine\u2019s Day, how perfect, right? [She was] just a great woman.
