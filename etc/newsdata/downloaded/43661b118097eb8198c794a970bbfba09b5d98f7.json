As a result, he and Aaron (Danny Miller) decided to go on the run \u2014 but matters became further complicated in tonight\u2019s episode as Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele) tracked them both down, before announcing that she was planning on absconding with them!\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough couple of months for Robert as, unable to let Lee get away with what he did to Victoria, he became hellbent on revenge. His efforts eventually backfired when his anger got the better of him, and thus he left Lee in a coma, and last night, an emotional Victoria informed Robert that Lee had died as a result of his injuries.\n\nUnable to process the news, Robert thought about how best to proceed, but failed to come up with any viable answers. However, Liv (Isobel Steele) provided him with an answer, as she suggested that both him and Aaron should on the run. After much deliberation, that\u2019s exactly what they set about doing, and \u2014 after bidding farewell to their nearest and dearest \u2014 Robert and Aaron set off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn tonight\u2019s episode, Liv struggled to cope following her big brother\u2019s departure, and matters were made worse when the police began asking questions about Robert\u2019s disappearance. Meanwhile, Aaron thought about how best for him and Robert to get out of dodge, and thus he contacted Mandy (Lisa Dingle) in the hope that she could acquire both him and Robert fake passports.\n\nMandy delivered the goods to Robert and Aaron, but the married couple were perturbed by the movement in the back of the Dingle van, and thought that Mandy had grassed them up to the police.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t the cops in the van, but rather Liv, who refused to say goodbye to Aaron again, claiming that she belongs with him, before revealing that she\u2019s not going back to the village, as she\u2019s going with Robert and Aaron when they set off.\n\nThe question is: will Liv follow through with her plan?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, will Aaron allow her to do so?\n\nAaron knows better than anyone how living life on the run comes at a cost, and he\u2019s likely not going to want that for Liv, so he\u2019ll no doubt try and talk her out of her decision. Having said that, when Liv makes up her mind, it\u2019s very hard for anyone to try and change it!\n\nEmmerdale continues on Thursday 17th October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Sally Dexter talks about Faith Dingle\u2019s upcoming exit\n\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Victoria Barton in danger as newcomer Luke linked to rapist Lee?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "As Robert and Aaron were about to set off, they got a surprise visitor in the form of Liv \u2014 who dropped quite the bombshell!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Liv-Flaherty-says-goodbye-to-Aaron-and-Robert-in-Emmerdale-dc8f.png?crop=110px%2C0px%2C4878px%2C2559px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
