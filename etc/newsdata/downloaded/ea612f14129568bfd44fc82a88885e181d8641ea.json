The purity, joy and the love of football was amazing,\u201d he tweeted after \u00adNewcastle siblings Sean and Matty had run more than any other players on the pitch to see off Manchester United.\n\nBut they weren\u2019t the only young men eligible to play for England who made fans ecstatic last weekend.\n\nChelsea\u2019s are drooling as much at Tammy Abraham being the joint top Premier League scorer as they are watching Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and \u00adCallum Hudson-Odoi \u2013 with 28 top-flight appearances \u00adbetween them \u2013 playing like seasoned veterans.\n\n(Image: Eddie Keogh for The FA/REX)\n\nAt Anfield, James Maddison enhanced his growing reputation with a swaggering display and a goal in front of the Kop.\n\nAt Norwich, Jack \u00adGrealish scored and was at the heart of everything \u00adcreative as Aston Villa won 5-1.\n\nAt Watford, Dean Henderson recovered from his goalkeeping howler in the previous game to put in a man-of-the-match \u00adperformance, which won \u00adSheffield United a point.\n\nThat\u2019s nine players with an \u00adaverage age of 21, only three of whom have played a couple of games each for England, starring in what we\u2019re \u00adtold constantly is the \u00adtoughest league in the world.\n\nAbroad, there were eight players eligible to be picked by Gareth Southgate appearing in the top leagues of Germany, Spain, Italy and France, with the Bundesliga quartet \u2013 Jadon \u00adSancho, Jonjoe Kenny, Lewis Baker and Reece Oxford \u2013 \u00adrunning an average age of 21.\n\n(Image: Eddie Keogh for The FA/REX)\n\nManchester United are under attack, but their decision to stop wasting cash on washed-up stars and go for youth is \u00adapplauded.\n\nIf they stick with that policy, we\u2019ll see plenty more like Mason Greenwood, who last month \u00adbecame the club\u2019s \u00adyoungest-ever goalscorer in Europe, coming off the production line.\n\nOne of the reasons Jurgen Klopp didn\u2019t spend big in the summer was that he wanted to provide a pathway for youth, in the hope of polishing another gem like Trent Alexander-\u00adArnold.\n\nOn Saturday, 16-year-old \u00adHarvey Elliott was on the bench.\n\nThe kids are finally getting their chance. And not just under Frank Lampard at Chelsea. This season the average age of players starting Premier League games (26 years, 304 days) is the lowest since 1992-93.\n\n(Image: Leicester City FC via Getty Imag)\n\nAnd, although they\u2019re not all English (look at Irish teenager Aaron Connolly and Welshman Daniel James), the biggest \u00adbenefactor has to be Southgate and the national side.\n\nFor once there\u2019s a generation of established internationals, who should be going on to build a substantial number of caps, \u00adunable to rest on their laurels.\n\nThe turnover under Southgate has already been high, especially in a period of relative success. From his first match three years ago this week against Malta, \u00adJordan Henderson is the only starter still in his squad.\n\nThink back to the World Cup semi-final against Croatia last year and only five who started the game \u2013 Jordan Pickford, Harry Maguire, Henderson, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling \u2013 are likely to start against the Czech Republic \u00adon Friday.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIndeed, only 11 of that squad made it into Southgate\u2019s current one, with four of the main men who played in that semi-final \u2013 Dele Alli, Kyle Walker, Jesse Lingard and Eric Dier \u2013 being left out.\n\nAn England victory on Friday virtually guarantees qualification for next year\u2019s Euros.\n\nWhich may give Southgate the chance to put even more \u00adestablished internationals under threat by blooding youngsters who are tearing it up for their clubs.\n\nMeaning the likes of Alli, \u00adLingard and Walker, who looked potential England centurions in the making, will need to \u00adseriously up their game to get back into his plans.\n\nLet\u2019s hear it for the boys.", "description": "This season the average age of players starting Premier League games (26 years, 304 days) is the lowest since 1992-93", "authors": ["Brian Reade", "Image", "Eddie Keogh For The Fa Rex", "Leicester City Fc Via Getty Imag", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20548323.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Mens-Senior-Football-Team-Camp-St-Georges-Park-National-Football-Centre-Burton-upon-Tren.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
