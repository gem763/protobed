But the stock slipped by more than 5 per cent to \u00a311.11 on the back of today's update.\n\nEasyjet said the demise of the world's oldest travel firm created 'difficult disruption' in the already turbulent sector.\n\nIt added that higher fuel costs, increased capacity and the weakness in the pound resulted in a 12 per cent jump in the headline costs for the full year, further denting already thin margins.\n\nBut it took cost-cutting measures to help mitigate the rising costs.\n\nChief executive Johan Lundgren said: 'Easyjet has continued to perform in line with expectations, despite challenging market conditions.\n\n'As a result of our self-help initiatives and the increased demand due to disruption at British Airways and Ryanair, we anticipate achieving headline profit before tax for the full year 2019 of between \u00a3420 million and \u00a3430 million.\n\nEasyJet said the demise of the world's oldest travel firm created 'difficult disruption' in the already turbulent sector\n\n'We have continued to invest in operational resilience, with the programme successfully reducing the impact of disruption on our operations.'\n\nRuss Mould from AJ Bell pointed to several reasons for the drop in the share price today, including high expectations and exposure to currency fluctuations.\n\n'The market appears to have already been expecting Easyjet to issue a fairly bullish statement and so the actual news may not have been as impressive as some investors wanted,' he said.\n\n'There was also a reminder in today's update of the extent to which the company is at the mercy of movements in fuel prices and foreign exchange, with a currency headwind of \u00a314million.'\n\nMould added that the statement 'offers little reason for genuine excitement' with 'considerable uncertainty' around Brexit still hanging over the airline.", "description": "Easyjet said it benefited over the past few months from higher demand as strike disruption knocked two of its rivals, Ryanair and British Airways.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
