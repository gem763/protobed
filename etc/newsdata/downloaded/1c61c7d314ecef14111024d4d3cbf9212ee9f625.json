The town\u2019s iconic seafront bisects the picture, with wheeling seabirds above, and the sun reflecting off the water below. Robertson was in town for the Conservative party conference \u2013 the last time the Lancashire seaside resort hosted one \u2013 and took a break to grab some fish and chips and watch the sun go down from the north pier. It is from there that the picture is taken.\n\nBuy your exclusive print here\n\nPrice\n\n\u00a350, including free delivery\n\nPrints\n\nPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.
