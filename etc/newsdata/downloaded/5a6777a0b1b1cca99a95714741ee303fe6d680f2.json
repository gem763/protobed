Aston Villa star's switch to No 10 could pay rich dividends for club and country", "language": "en", "text": "Jack Grealish is further up the pitch for Aston Villa and, perhaps, closer to the England squad. Grealish\u2019s switch in position at Carrow Road led to his best performance back in the Premier League, and the call-up he desperately craves from Gareth Southgate could be around the corner.\n\nDean Smith moved his captain into what was effectively a No 10 role in a forward front three and it paid off spectacularly, with the 24 year-old involved in all of Villa\u2019s five goals and given more freedom to dictate play.\n\nGrealish even scored the third, finishing off a fine attacking move, and the tactical tweak from Smith is surely the way forward for Villa on their return to the top flight.\n\nSouthgate has been keeping a close eye on Grealish so far this season, and the attacking midfielder hopes international recognition is not too far away.\n\nWhen asked if he expected to make the England squad for this month\u2019s European qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, Grealish said: \u201cNo, not really. Not at the moment. I know for a fact if I play to the best of my ability then I can get in there. This time, truthfully, I did not expect to get in.", "description": "Jack Grealish is further up the pitch for Aston Villa and, perhaps, closer to the England squad.", "authors": ["John Percy", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212135962-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLiZnSJs8x6dOfuqFtiWqEY8Ptm8UqUMiPvlHWVTcVRE.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
