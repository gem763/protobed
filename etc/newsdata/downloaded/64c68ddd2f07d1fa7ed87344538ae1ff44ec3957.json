Turkey considers them to be terrorists, indistinguishable from Kurdish separatists in Turkey that Turkey and the U.S. have both designated terrorist organizations. But the U.S. armed, closely partnered with and fought alongside the SDF in the fight against ISIS, with Kurdish forces losing 11,000 troops in that battle.\n\nIt was unclear Thursday whether the SDF had agreed to the deal reached by the U.S. and Turkey, which will also face strong resistance from Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian leader who has waged a brutal eight-and-a-half year war to retake Syrian territory and is backed by Russia, Iran and Iranian proxies, such as, Hezbollah.\n\nInstead, the deal recognizes Turkish control over the safe zone that it sought against Kurdish forces, requires \"the re-collection of YPG heavy weapons and the disablement of their fortifications and all other fighting positions,\" and will see the U.S. repeal sanctions against senior Turkish officials once the Turkish operation is halted.\n\nPHOTO: Vice President Mike Pence, left, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pose for photos before their talks at the presidential palace, in Ankara, Turkey, on Oct. 17, 2019.
