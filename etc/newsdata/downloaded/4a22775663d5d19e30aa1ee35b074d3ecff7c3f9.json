Well, I wasn\u2019t operating on my own!\u201d\n\nGiuliani went on to claim that he spoke to Volker eight times and that the State Department \u201cbasically knew everything I was doing,\u201d further stating that he was sent one message where the department gave him a \u201cbig thank-you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should actually get some kind of an award,\u201d he added, echoing his assertion earlier in the day that he\u2019ll \u201cbe the hero\u201d in the end.\n\nIngraham noted that people were \u201cextremely confused\u201d about his relationship with the State Department, asking why it was giving him \u201cmarching orders\u201d for his Ukrainian investigations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason I\u2019m in the middle of this and it emerges from the corruption of how they tried to hide this for years, including trying to cover up Biden for years,\u201d Giuliani, who won\u2019t say if he has a security clearance, declared. \u201cI got this because the FBI wouldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nAfter claiming that he now gets a \u201cvisceral reaction\u201d to Biden and doing a weird impersonation of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Giuliani was once again asked why he was working with State rather than the FBI or the Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cFor a year and a half, [Ukrainians] were trying to get these\u2014this information to the FBI but they weren\u2019t interested,\u201d the former New York City mayor alleged. \u201cThey even hired a lawyer in America. They even gave it to several U.S. attorneys.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, at the same time, repeatedly insisted that he \u201cdidn\u2019t reach out to the State Department,\u201d prompting Ingraham to ask if Giuliani was acting as Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonal representative interfacing with State\u201d or as a \u201ckind of a pseudo-government emissary working to ferret out corruption in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey asked me if I would take a call from Yermak and if I would meet with him, and I did and I reported it back to them, and the conversation was completely normal, and there was no bribery and there was no extortion,\u201d Giuliani replied. \u201cNothing like what Biden did. I didn\u2019t do that and the president didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThe Fox News host, meanwhile, noted that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is reportedly unhappy with Giuliani, causing the ex-mayor to say the State Department \u201cshould congratulate him\u201d because he unveiled \u201cmass corruption\u201d by Biden. (There is no evidence Biden or his son were responsible for any wrongdoing in Ukraine.)\n\n\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m the legitimate whistleblower,\u201d he boasted. \u201cI have uncovered corruption that this Washington swamp has been covering up effectively for years and his State Department, you know, asked me to do this. So Mike, if you\u2019re unhappy with me, I\u2019m sorry but I accomplished my mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea if he is unhappy with me or not,\u201d Giuliani added. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m the president\u2019s lawyer!\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with The Atlantic hours earlier, however, Giuliani said: \u201cI\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI have no idea if [Mike Pompeo] is unhappy with me or not,\u201d Giuliani added. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t care.
