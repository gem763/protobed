It\u2019s a lot of people dressed up in costumes from the DC comic universe essentially playing out a soap opera.\n\nUnlike the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which only includes drama as a subplot to the main story of fighting bad guys and saving the world, the DC television universe \u2014 dubbed the \u201cArrowverse\u201d after its flagship show \u201cArrow\u201d \u2014 centers around drama, essentially making it the exact reverse of the MCU. It can feel like a slog for people looking for a superhero show to enjoy.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that the shows on the CW seem to have fallen to the problem of becoming programming that scratches a very hard-left itch. The shows are filthy with social justice messaging and left-leaning talking points. The Super Girl television show, for instance, has done everything from promoting anti-gun messaging to hinting not-so-subtly that Donald Trump is a racist.\n\nIt would appear that the Batwoman television show looks to follow that very same path. While the pilot episode didn\u2019t push social justice messaging as hard as the trailer for the show implied, it still pushes it. In fact, many people have surmised that Batwoman is DC\u2019s response to the MCU Captain Marvel with Brie Larson due to all the \u201cgirl-power\u201d and anti-man messaging the show contains.\n\nYou can watch the trailer below and see for yourself.\n\nYou can probably guess how the reviews went by this point.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the critics couldn\u2019t stop raving about it. Meanwhile, the audience score is beyond dismal. As of this writing, Batwoman has a 72 percent critic score and only a 10 percent audience score.\n\nAs a response, the left is already making the excuse that the reason everyone hates Batwoman is that she\u2019s a woman, and a lesbian to boot! Horror of horrors!\n\nForbe\u2019s Paul Tassi, for instance, didn\u2019t even try to hint his way around the issue. He straight up accused many people of being sexist for their dislike of the show:\n\nOn IMDB you can only see usernames, but on Rotten Tomatoes they at least have first names listed for fan reviews, and sometimes photos. Of the first 100 reviews I counted, 95 appear to be written by men. Two of the five women gave it a positive score, the only two positive scores I saw out of all 100. I could probably keep going, but I\u2019m guessing the ratio would remain roughly the same. I am definitely not saying that Batwoman is some masterpiece, but it does not take the World\u2019s Greatest Detective to figure out what\u2019s happening here, even if many of the negative reviews don\u2019t reference sexuality or politics. Batwoman is certainly no worse in the script and action department than the early episodes of these other Arrowverse series, and yet I never saw any of them lambasted to this degree.\n\nThis is a constant callback for leftist culture reviewers who find themselves in the position of having to defend a show or movie that has received negative audience scores. Those who hate a show or movie with a woman lead or that glorifies things social justice advocates hold as holy are only doing so because they\u2019re racist, or homophobic, or sexist, or (insert \u201cists\u201d and \u201cphobes\u201d here).\n\nEach time this happens, moviegoers everywhere \u2014 including yours truly \u2014 point out that it\u2019s not the race or sex that causes people to dislike a show. If that were the case, then there are so many franchises, movies, and games that are cherished by the general public that would be despised. Alien, Metroid, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Hunger Games, Wonder Woman, and Terminator all had female leads that fans the world over adore.\n\nSo it must be a completely different reason, and that reason is very obvious.\n\nPeople hate being preached to about things they don\u2019t believe in.\n\nBatwoman sold itself entirely on the premise that she is a social justice hero, and because of that, the show has been geared toward highlighting this political stance. The plot, the action, and more are all geared to promote that idea. This makes for a very boring show that frankly, no one wants to watch.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the vast majority of people don\u2019t fall in line with social justice advocacy due to its high level of bigotry, racism, and sexism, and you have a show that just straight up disgusts people.\n\nPeople don\u2019t care that the lead is a woman. They care that you\u2019ve created a boring show that promotes philosophies and stances that people disagree with. What\u2019s more, this was done in a superhero format. People watch superhero media because they want to see amazing concepts, not watch as they sit around and discuss their feelings on the LGBT community while wearing tights.\n\nExploring the psychology of a villain or hero can work wonders in both comics and movies \u2014 I think Todd Phillips proved that with Joker \u2014 but even that is something that many readers would find a fascinating character development, which lends to the story.\n\nNobody is fascinated by another pro-LGBT writer talking about how everyone is mean to gays, lesbians, and trans people. Nobody is glued to their seat while some out-of-touch writer on the coast tells them they\u2019re racist through a character in a mask. Few people can relate to this, mostly in part because the vast majority of people aren\u2019t racist or homophobic.\n\nIt ain\u2019t the woman that\u2019s the topic, it\u2019s the show\u2019s driving principle of putting politics before story.\n\nIt\u2019s propaganda.
