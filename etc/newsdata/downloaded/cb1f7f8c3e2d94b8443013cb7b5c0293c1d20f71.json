It is 260 feet high.\n\nMargaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is a very good novel. The Testaments is not. Here\u2019s my review.\n\nMichael Lewis reviews the wartime journal of a German in Paris: \u201cNazi Germany produced two wartime diaries of equal literary and historical significance but written from the most different perspectives conceivable. Victor Klemperer wrote furtively, in daily dread of transport to an extermination camp, a fate he was spared by the firebombing of Dresden. Ernst J\u00fcnger, by contrast, had what was once called a \u2018good war.\u2019 As a bestselling German author, he drew cushy occupation duty in Paris, where he could hobnob with famous artists and writers, prowl antiquarian bookstores, and forage for the rare beetles he collected. Yet Klemperer and J\u00fcnger both found themselves anxiously sifting propaganda and hearsay to learn the truth about distant events on which their lives hung. One might ask why it has taken 70 years for J\u00fcnger\u2019s diary to appear in English translation, for there is no more detailed account of the occupation from the German point of view. But J\u00fcnger was always controversial, up to his death in 1998 at the age of 102. In Germany, polite opinion has never forgiven him for Storm of Steel, his memoir of World War I that saw in the experience of combat an ultimate test of manhood. \u2018The finest, most visceral account of battle since the Iliad,\u2019 according to the New Statesman, his book made him a hero among German nationalists and ensured his privileged status in Nazi Germany. As it happens, J\u00fcnger was anything but a Nazi.\u201d\n\nThe truth about teacher pay: \u201cOne of the most common beliefs about American education is that teaching is an \u2018underpaid\u2019 profession. Think tanks purport to calculate the \u2018teacher pay gap.\u2019 The media run stories about teachers taking second and third jobs to pay the bills. Politicians call for across-the-board raises. They all see raising teacher pay as a matter of simple fairness, as well as a way to attract better teachers and improve educational outcomes. They are all misguided. The highly publicized \u2018pay gap\u2019 that dominates news headlines is the product of a simplistic methodology that, when universally applied, suggests that nurses, firefighters, and other professionals are dramatically overpaid. Furthermore, predictions generated by the underpaid-teacher hypothesis \u2014 such as that teachers must have high quit rates, or that a large percentage of their income flows from second jobs \u2014 are not supported by the data. Teachers as a group are generally well compensated, and teacher pay and benefits have risen faster over time than compensation in private-sector jobs. Failure to recognize these facts can lead education reform down a blind alley.\u201d\n\nHarry Stein remembers the \u201cgreatest scandal in American sports history\u201d: \u201cWhen eight members of the Chicago White Sox\u2014known forever after as the Black Sox\u2014threw the 1919 World Series.\u201d\n\nThe story of Syria\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d library: \u201cIn a region that sways \u2018on the palm of a genie,\u2019 as the Arabic saying goes, where bullets and explosions are more familiar than bread, you would not expect people to read, let alone to risk their lives for the sake of books. Yet in 2013 a group of enthusiastic readers in Daraya, five miles southwest of Damascus, salvaged thousands of books from ruined homes, wrapping them in blankets just as they would victims of the war raging around them. They brought the books into the basement of a building whose upper floors had been wrecked by bombs and set up a library. As Mike Thomson recounts this unlikely story in Syria\u2019s Secret Library, this underground book collection surrounded by sandbags functioned, as one user put it, as an \u2018oasis of normality in this sea of destruction.\u2019 There, the self-appointed chief librarian, a 14-year-old named Amjad, would write down in a large file the names of people who borrowed the books, and then return to his seat to continue reading.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nIn The American Interest, Daniel Kennelly revisits Walter M. Miller Jr.\u2019s A Canticle for Leibowitz. The novel is as prescient as ever:\n\n\u201c\u2018Miraculous\u2019 seems like the most fitting word to describe the publication, 60 years ago, of Walter M. Miller Jr.\u2019s 1959 post-apocalyptic science fiction classic, A Canticle for Leibowitz. Stitched together from three novellas originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Canticle traces the history of a Catholic monastery located in the American desert Southwest over three time periods beginning 600 years after a mid-20th-century nuclear war. The book\u2019s three sections describe a span of about 1,200 years, roughly mirroring our own Dark Ages, Renaissance, and present day.\n\n\u201cThe novel\u2019s miraculous nature comes to us despite what we might call its maculate conception. For starters, it sprang forth, if not quite ex nihilo, then from what literary highbrows thought of as the backwater of pulp science fiction magazines. From there it went on to garner praise not only from genre fans, winning the 1961 Hugo Award, but also, slowly but steadily, mainstream praise and popularity, remaining in print continuously and selling millions of copies over the years. Catholics, too, have sung its praises for its thoughtful meditation on Original Sin and the fallenness of man\u2014this despite the fact that its author, a self-professed \u2018on-again, off-again\u2019 Catholic who in his later years drifted toward Eastern religion and philosophy, had probably left the Church behind for good by the time he wrote it.\n\n\u201cThe most miraculous thing about this book, however, is that it offers a profound critique of the extremists at either end of our so-called crisis of liberalism and serves as a stark reminder that these debates are nowhere near as new as some think. But to see how this is so, it helps to understand a few things about the book and how Miller came to write it.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Frensham Pond\n\nPoem: Jessica Hornik, \u201cAt Scargo Lake\u201d\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
