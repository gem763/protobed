See, e.g., Arrington v. Burger King Worldwide, Inc., et al., No. 1:18-cv-24128 (S.D. Fla.); Butler v. Jimmy John\u2019s Franchise, LLC, 331 F. Supp. 3d 786 (S.D. Ill. 2018). In those cases, the courts have focused on identifying the appropriate standard (per se, rule of reason, or quick look) to be applied in determining whether the allegations were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSeveral states have followed the DOJ\u2019s lead and launched their own investigations and, in some cases, challenges to the lawfulness of no-poach agreements, particularly in the franchisor-franchisee context. The Washington State Attorney General has been particularly active in this arena, and in October 2018, it filed a lawsuit against restaurant chain Jersey Mike\u2019s, which had refused to remove a no-poach clause from its franchise agreements. The court recently denied a motion to dismiss filed by Jersey Mike\u2019s, allowing the case to proceed.\n\nSince then, the DOJ brought a civil antitrust lawsuit challenging a no-poach agreement as per se unlawful, which resulted in entry of a consent judgment; however, to date, the DOJ has not filed criminal charges challenging any no-poach agreement, in that action or otherwise.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s recent enforcement campaign against no-poach agreements began when it brought a series of cases against a number of high-profile, technology companies, because of agreements between the companies not to cold call each other\u2019s employees, and in some cases, agreements not to hire each other\u2019s employees. These cases ultimately resulted in consent judgments. Then, in October 2016, the DOJ and the FTC issued their first \u201cAntitrust Guidance for Human Resource Professionals\u201d in which they, among other things, warned employers that \u201cnaked\u201d no-poach agreements (that is, agreements that are not reasonably necessary for a separate legitimate business transaction or collaboration) were considered per se illegal under federal antitrust laws and that, going forward, the DOJ might seek criminal penalties against companies that enter into such agreements. 1\n\nDOJ\u2019s Statements of Interest\n\nThe DOJ recently filed Statements of Interest in several of these civil antitrust cases pending in Eastern District of Washington. The DOJ asserted that franchisor-franchisee no-poach agreements should be subject to a rule of reason analysis, and not the more stringent per se standard. See Myriah Richmond, et al. v. Bergey Pullman Inc., et al., No. 2:18-cv-00246-SAB, (E.D. Wash.); Stigar v. Dough Dough Inc., et al., No. 2:18-cv-00244 (E.D. Wash.); Harris v. CJ Star LLC, et al., No. 2:18-cv-00247 (E.D. Wash.).\n\nThe DOJ noted that \u201chorizontal\u201d agreements between competing fast-food companies not to hire each other\u2019s employees could constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act. However, the DOJ argued, the franchisor-franchisee relationship is vertical, and is therefore properly assessed under the rule of reason. However, it bears noting that where a franchisor owns and operates its own stores, it may be viewed as having both a vertical and horizontal relationship with its franchisees and, depending upon the relevant facts, the DOJ\u2019s analysis might not apply. The DOJ\u2019s Statements of Interest demonstrate its intent to closely scrutinize the relationship between entities to determine which standard applies (per se or rule of reason), which will likely result in a highly fact-intensive inquiry if the case proceeds beyond the motion to dismiss phase, as all such cases have to date.\n\nIn its Statements of Interest, the DOJ also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the agreements between the franchisors and franchisees constituted a \u201chub-and-spoke conspiracy.\u201d The DOJ noted that to successfully state a claim based on this doctrine, the plaintiffs would need to plead that there was a horizontal agreement among \u201cspokes\u201d \u2013 here, franchisees \u2013 not to hire from each other, and that the franchisor \u201chub\u201d agreed to participate in that horizontal agreement. The plaintiffs would also need to demonstrate the existence of a \u201crim\u201d to the wheel in order to form an agreement among the horizontal competitors. The DOJ argued that the plaintiffs in the three cases had not pled the existence of a rim, but that even if they did, the franchise relationship is a legitimate business collaboration and thus no-poach agreements qualify as ancillary restraints that would qualify for rule of reason analysis.\n\nThe DOJ also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 position that a \u201cquick-look\u201d analysis \u2013 a subset of the rule of reason \u2013 should apply, noting that such analysis should be employed only when the conduct\u2019s anticompetitive effects can easily be ascertained and it is \u201cimplausible\u201d that the procompetitive benefits would outweigh harm to competition. Here, the DOJ argued that because franchise no-poach agreements may indeed provide procompetitive benefits and promote interbrand competition, they do not qualify for quick-look analysis.2\n\nThe Washington State Attorney General weighs in\n\nNotably, the Washington State Attorney General sought leave to file an amicus brief in response to the DOJ\u2019s Statements of Interest in these cases, which the court granted. In its briefing, the Washington Attorney General argues in part \u2013 at least as to the antitrust claims under state law, including Washington\u2019s Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.920 \u2013 that franchise-based no-poach deals should be considered per se unlawful as a form of market allocation. See, e.g., Stigar, No. 2:18-cv-00244, Doc. No. 36. In support, the Washington Attorney General notes that at least one state court judge (in the decision in Jersey Mike\u2019s, discussed above) has already rejected arguments that a franchisor\u2019s use of no-poach provisions in its franchise agreements should be analyzed under the rule of reason, preserving the State\u2019s per se and quick-look claims under the Washington Consumer Protection Act.\n\nConclusions and key takeaways\n\nThe DOJ chose to file Statements of Interest in the private, civil cases pending in the Eastern District of Washington. It presumably did so both to potentially influence the outcome of those cases and to state publicly that while it can and will aggressively enforce the antitrust laws against \u201cnaked\u201d restraints on hiring between competitors, it recognizes that some no-poach agreements might, on balance, be procompetitive and may survive antitrust scrutiny under the more lenient rule of reason standard.\n\nHowever, the law is evolving in this area and, as reflected in the recent amicus brief filed by the State of Washington in litigation pending in the Eastern District of Washington, no-poach agreements that may pass muster with the DOJ might still be subject to investigation and an enforcement proceeding by a state attorney general. And, in the current enforcement environment, in which many state attorneys general are actively seeking to fill what they view as an enforcement void in federal law enforcement, including antitrust enforcement, this risk should not be treated lightly. Also, at a minimum, the DOJ\u2019s filings in no way mitigate the antitrust enforcement risk that companies face from agreeing with their direct competitors to any restraints in their hiring practices.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating their current no-poach provisions, or when considering such agreements in the future, companies should keep the following in mind:\n\nThe DOJ has made clear that it intends to continue to aggressively bring enforcement actions to prohibit naked no-poach agreements between companies that compete in the labor market \u2013 that is, agreements that are not part of a legitimate business transaction \u2013 as per se unlawful.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s Statements of Interest recognize that there are circumstances in which an employer has a legitimate, procompetitive reason to enter into a no-poach agreement. This may be the case where a supplier or franchisor wishes to restrict the ability of its franchisees or distributors to compete with one another for employees: that is, the relationship between the parties is vertical.\n\nAlthough not addressed by the DOJ in its filings, a no-poach agreement may also be considered procompetitive where such an agreement is part of a legitimate business transaction between horizontal competitors: such as the sale of assets or of a business where the value of the assets or business purchased hinges in part on the existing employees remaining in place for some period of time.\n\nIn either case \u2013 a purely vertical agreement or one that is ancillary to a legitimate business transaction \u2013 the terms of the no-poach agreement will be assessed for their reasonableness, taking into account a variety of relevant facts.\n\nRegardless of the DOJ\u2019s position, state enforcers, such as the Washington State Attorney General, may argue for the application of the more stringent per se standard under respective state laws.\n\nIn light of these considerations and the heightened level of antitrust scrutiny that no-poach agreements receive today, companies should consult with experienced antitrust counsel when evaluating their legitimate procompetitive bases for including such provisions in their business agreements, both now and in the future.\n\nRead our prior alert on this guidance. The DOJ went so far as to argue that the court should reject the decisions of two other federal district courts that have recently allowed antitrust claims challenging no-poach agreements to survive motions to dismiss and have seemed to indicate that a quick-look analysis may be appropriate in analyzing these franchisor-franchisee no-poach agreements. See, e.g., Butler v. Jimmy John\u2019s Franchise, LLC, 331 F. Supp. 3d 786 (S.D. Ill. 2018).\n\nClient Alert 2019-064", "description": "", "authors": ["Authors", "Edward B. Schwartz", "Michelle A.
