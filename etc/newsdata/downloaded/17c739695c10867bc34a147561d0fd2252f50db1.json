However, one important counter-argument is that, historically, the Fed has never disappointed market expectations when they were so strikingly one-sided\u2014pinning a 96.2% probability of a rate cut by mid European morning.\n\nWe would still argue that the Fed is unlikely to cut rates any further after Wednesday, if bond traders' moves \u2014signaling a retrenchment in future rate cut expectations\u2014prove right. What will that mean for U.S. stocks, which are hovering at record highs in large part based on the Fed's policy easing, on top of better-than expected corporate results and trade hopes?\n\nMeanwhile, Europe's slipped lower, with financial services shares underperforming. The pan-European index erased one and a half sessions of gains, after posting six straight days of winnings that brought the benchmark near a two-year high.\n\nThe drop is likely to have been also spurred by the announcement, by Saudi Arabia's state oil company\u2014and the world's most profitable\u2014that Saudi Aramco is finally kicking off its long-awaited Initial Public Offering on Sunday, prompting portfolio managers to shed some existing holdings in order to make room for the new stock.\n\nIn the earlier Asian session, regional equities were a mixed bag, with China\u2019s (-0.87%) and Hong Kong\u2019s (-0.39%) closing in the red after Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carie Lam warned that months of political protests are taking a harsh toll on the city's economy.\n\nGlobal Financial Affairs\n\nS&P 500 Daily Chart\n\nYesterday, U.S. shares resumed a rally, with the sealing a double record on a closing and a high basis.
