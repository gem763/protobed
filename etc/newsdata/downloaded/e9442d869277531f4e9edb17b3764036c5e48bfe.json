He stood in the dock wearing a dark suit, shirt and dark blue tie.\n\nA date for sentencing has yet to be decided.\n\nMs Wellgreen, 46, was last seen alive on October 9, 2018, and has never been located despite extensive searches by police at a number of places.\n\n(Image: SWNS.COM)\n\nAt its peak, 115 officers were searching for her every day across 2,771 search locations.\n\nA prosecutor claimed Lacomba, 39, murdered the mum and then disposed of her body \"in a calculated manner, designed to avoid detection\".\n\nThe prosecution had told the court, in south-east London, that he was motivated by the potential loss of the home he shared with Ms Wellgreen and having limited access to their children as a result.\n\nMs Wellgreen had landed a new job with more pay and was buying Lacomba out of the property, the court heard.\n\nThe trial began on September 30 and lasted four weeks.\n\nJudge Christopher Kinch QC had today asked the jurors to answer two key questions when making their verdict, reports Kent Live.\n\nThe first was \u201cAre we sure that Sarah Jane Wellgreen is dead?\u201d and the second was \u201cAre we sure that Ben Lacomba intended to and did kill Sarah Jane Wellgreen?\u201d.\n\nJurors had to answer yes - so that they were sure - to both of these questions to deliver a guilty verdict.\n\nIf there was any doubt, they were informed that they must return a not guilty verdict.\n\nMeanwhile, giving evidence during the murder trial, Lacomba claimed he went to bed on the night of October 9 last year and woke up at 7am the next day to find Ms Wellgreen missing from their four-bedroom home.\n\nUnder cross-examination, prosecutor Alison Morgan QC challenged Lacomba to point to a map and reveal the location of Ms Wellgreen's body, asking: \"Where\u2019s Sarah?\u201d\n\nHe replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor asked: \u201cWhere did you put her body?\u201d\n\nLacomba responded: \u201cI did not.\u201d\n\nTwo of Ms Wellgreen's phones, her purse and her bank cards were still at the house and her Hyundai car was parked outside after she was reported missing, the trial heard.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nOne of her phones has never been found, jurors were told.\n\nCalls were going to voicemail and there was no activity on her WhatsApp or Facebook accounts as her family desperately tried to contact her.\n\nFamily members and Neil James, her on-off partner at the time, told Lacomba they would be contacting the police to search for her.\n\nLacomba contacted the force more than 24 hours after Ms Wellgreen was last seen, placing two emergency calls, the trial was told.\n\nIn a 999 call played for the jury, he said she had never disappeared before and claimed she was seeing multiple men.\n\nHe also alleged that she had a stalker and had been assaulted at work in Portsmouth, Hampshire.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhen asked whether he had \"any idea\" of her whereabouts, he replied \"No I don't. That's why I'm phoning you.\"\n\nIn her closing statement, Rebecca Trowler, defending, suggested Ms Wellgreen could have walked out of the home and left her life \"behind\", telling jurors there was \"no trace of a killing\" at the home.\n\nMs Wellgreen and Lacomba, who were no longer a couple, had been living under the same roof.\n\nJurors heard Ms Wellgreen sent messages to on/off partner Mr James and two male friends, Anthony Garnham and Joe Eleini, at around 8pm on October 9 after returning home from work.\n\nIn messages to Mr James she referred to Lacomba as a \"fat t**t\" and said she was going to bed early because \"I don't like to sit downstairs with Ben\".\n\nMs Morgan claimed Lacomba had switched off the CCTV at their home that night. Lacomba claimed it was Ms Wellgreen who turned it off.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nCCTV footage allegedly showed the defendant's car leaving New Ash Green and returning about two hours later in the early morning of October 10, 2018.\n\nA data session started on one of his phones just before 4.30am in an attempt to delete things off the device, the prosecution said.\n\nThe court heard he wasn't wearing his normal brown shoes when he went to work at All Night Cars later that morning, telling colleagues he had lost them after he was mocked over the \"battleship grey, horrible pointy shoes\" he had turned up in.\n\nGiving evidence, Lacomba claimed he had panicked when he threw two of his mobile phones into the Thames five days after Ms Wellgreen was last seen.\n\nHe told the court he had \"snapped\" the phones and removed the Sim card before dumping them in the river.\n\n(Image: JIM BENNETT)\n\nHe claimed he was \"paranoid\" that the police may been bugging his telephone and \"looking at me for Sarah's murder\".\n\nMs Morgan alleged he got rid of the phones to prevent police from figuring out where he had disposed of the body.\n\nA 5-ft long shovel found in a garden shed at the home they shared was shown to the jury.\n\nLacomba told the court it was a Christmas gift for his mother, but Ms Morgan told him it was \"complete nonsense\" he had bought a \"gravedigger's shovel\" as a gift.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Ivan Beasley, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said after the verdict: \"Sarah had every reason to live \u2013 she had secured a new, better-paid job days before her disappearance, was looking forward to one of her children\u2019s birthdays and was getting into position to buy the family home outright.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"While we are yet to locate Sarah\u2019s body, it is clear to us that Sarah is no longer alive due to the inactivity of her bank and phone accounts, no contact with friends or family and the fact she left the home without any of her personal items or shown any plans to leave. She didn\u2019t even take her car.\n\n\"But when you look at Ben Lacomba, knowing what we know about Sarah and you begin to prove his account of what happened is untruthful, that he had reason to kill Sarah to avoid being left behind by her, it leaves us with little choice but to conclude he killed her.\n\n\"No other person came to that house that night, Sarah didn\u2019t walk out of there by herself and Lacomba had clearly researched how to leave the area without being seen \u2013 or so he thought.\n\n\"I\u2019m pleased the jury came to the same conclusion.\n\n\"Lacomba refuses to tell us where Sarah is which makes it difficult to find her and provide her family with some of the closure they so desperately need. Enquiries to find her will continue and so will the support we provide to Sarah\u2019s family and close friends.\"", "description": "Ben Lacomba, 39, denied killing Sarah Wellgreen, 46, whose body is still missing a year after she vanished from New Ash Green, Kent", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Amber Hicks", "Image", "Swns.Com", "Pa", "Jim Bennett"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13938354.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Police-photo-of-Sarah-Wellgreen-36-who-is-reported-missing-and-was-last-seen-near-Bazes-Shaw-New.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
