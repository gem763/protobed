Most of the patients are young men, in their teens, twenties or early thirties.\n\nThe University of Adelaide researchers said their findings show tougher government regulation of vaping was now required.\n\n\u201cThere are no regulations on the manufacturing of e-liquids. There are also no requirements to list the ingredients or their quantities,\u201d said Miranda Ween, one of the scientists behind the study.\n\n\"As such, no two \u2018\u2019apple\u2019, \u2018chocolate\u2019 or \u2018cotton candy\u2019 e-liquids will be made with the same flavouring ingredients, or even concentrations.
