But Gleason said the injunction is only intended to be in place until a decision is reached on the case\u2019s merits and that there are other planned, upcoming sales in the region.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge in Alaska has halted a timber sale planned within the country's largest national forest while the merits of the case are argued.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
