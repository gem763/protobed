And on Tuesday, it was reported that a Universal Orlando Resort employee was fired after concerned parents found a photo of him making the hand sign on their six-year-old\u2019s shoulder (their child is biracial and has autism).\n\nThe OK sign joins a number of surprising symbols co-opted by the alt-right, such as the milk emoji, Pepe the frog and even, at one point, Taylor Swift.\n\nSometimes, trolls\u2019 choices are far-fetched and innocuous \u2013 the milk emoji was appropriated because of the allegedly superior ability of white people to drink milk (large numbers of people in the rest of the world are lactose intolerant). But the transformation of mundane symbols into something to be feared is part of a broader aim to garner media attention, and getting one up on the people they think they\u2019re fooling.\n\n\u201cReporters don\u2019t always understand that [trolls] seek media attention \u2013 when they see something get media uptake, they capitalise on it,\u201d says Dr Joan Donovan, a media manipulation expert who is the director of Harvard\u2019s Technology and Social Change (TaSC) Research Project.\n\nShe explains how these media manipulators see an opportunity \u2013 for example, when something goes viral or becomes popular \u2013 and choose it as a moment to insert themselves into the conversation. In the case of the Facebook \u201cTrash Doves\u201d sticker, for example, 4chan users noticed the cartoon go viral and sent out the rallying cry: \u201cLet\u2019s make this normie meme a Nazi symbol!\u201d\n\nThe trolls have a laugh when the journalists are fooled Dr Joan Donovan\n\nWith this process, they flex their muscles, showing that what the Lord giveth, the alt-right can take away. And it\u2019s done through elaborate means, too: with Trash Doves, 4chan-users began to photoshop swastikas on to the viral Facebook cartoon. Sometimes they\u2019re even more sophisticated, creating fake content cards like that of the ADL\u2019s. They circulate the content online through social media, leaving it out as bait for undiscerning journalists who perpetuate the hoax by writing about it as if it is an authentic hate-threat.\n\n\u201cThis is their trick: they are hoping journalists will uncritically look at the OK symbol, find these infographics that claim it stands for white power and then write about it. The trolls have a laugh when the journalists are fooled,\u201d says Donovan.\n\n\u201cThese become symbols of hate pretty much exclusively because of journalistic coverage,\u201d says Wendy Phillips, who wrote This is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice things: Mapping the Relationship between Online Trolling and Mainstream Culture.\n\nUltimately, this a game about power: if rightwing trolls can make the so-called liberal media look gullible, then it has a delegitimising effect, supporting the idea that journalists are oversensitive, easily triggered snowflakes. Soon enough, the news begins to feels like it belongs to a parody website rather than real life.\n\n\u201cWhat memes do is they create in-groups and out-groups. The in-groups know it\u2019s satirical, the out-groups think it\u2019s something to fear,\u201d says Donovan. \ufeff\n\nPart of the effect is to make you think that white supremacists could be everywhere, hiding in plain sight. If someone as important as the president could be one of them \u2013 Trump likes to flash the gesture when he speaks \u2013 who else is? Heck, maybe you\u2019re a white supremacist, because the last time you sent an OK emoji you were unwittingly signalling your belief in the superiority of the white race.\n\nPepe the Frog creator wins $15,000 settlement against Infowars Read more\n\nAt some point, life begins to imitate their art, and what began as a media hoax takes on dangerously radical connotations. This point came when the Australian man charged with killing 51 people at mosques in New Zealand, made the OK gesture during a courtroom appearance after being arrested.\n\nPhillips says even if stories written about these memes are incredulous or mocking, they might help the cause, since media attention is what those groups are after.\n\n\u201cMany of us tend to be very fascinated in the bad guys themselves which is understandable but they are the smallest part of the story,\u201d she says.\n\nSo what does this mean for journalists? Phillips argues that media organisations can\u2019t ever truly separate themselves from the amplification of white nationalists if they have to report on them.\n\nInstead, she advocates for the media to shift the camera away from the white supremacists and focus on its real victims. That means looking at its impact on minority communities in places like Texas, and on the people who live in the small towns that neo-Nazis turn up in. It means highlighting the toxic resentment of women that the patriarchal ideology of white nationalism results in, and what it feels like for a mother to have white supremacists take her daughter away.\n\nUltimately, it means reporting the news but in a different way, says Phillips: \u201cI don\u2019t think the media shouldn\u2019t tell the truth, you should just tell a bigger truth: about the impact of these behaviours, instead of just reporting on the genesis of them.\u201d", "description": "The media has been manipulated by extremists but focusing on the victims offers journalists a way to redress the balance", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2204dd6df26a106b43ab91b19a523aba91f3a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71f97183d7204f50737f62401b2196eb"}
