The vehicle is planned for travel to the Moon, Mars, and beyond\n\nThe new video, picked up by Business Insider, shows SpaceX's facilities in Boca Chica, Texas, a small village on the southeastern coast of just a few miles north of the border with Mexico.\n\nFive years ago, SpaceX began construction on a launchpad there and intends to test several rocket launches there and compare its effectiveness to the company's other main launch facility in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe Starship and Super Heavy Rocket travel through the Earth's atmosphere after launch\n\n'We are going to be building ships and boosters at both Boca and the Cape as fast as we can,' Musk said in a presentation last weekend.\n\n'It's going to be really nutty to see a bunch of these things \u2014 I mean, not just one, but a whole stack of them.'\n\n'And we're improving both the design and the manufacturing method exponentially.'\n\nOne of the main differences between the sites is ownership.\n\nIn Cape Canaveral, SpaceX leases property from NASA and the Air Force, while in Boca Chica, SpaceX has been busy buying property from locals.\n\nThe Starship and Super Heavy Rocket reach orbit above Earth\n\nThe Super Heavy Rocket detaches from the Starship and returns to the launch site, while the Starship links up with a tanker vehicle and is loaded with more propellant for travel deeper into space\n\nSpaceX owns 112 parcels of land in Boca Chica and the surrounding area, and has purchased six homes from village residents between 2014 and 2017.\n\nCurrent NASA safety standards recommend a 3-mile radius around launch sites, but in Boca Chica, there is still a private home 1.8 miles away from SpaceX's launch pad.\n\nSpaceX has been steadily buy land and homes in Boca Chica Village Texas, and the surrounding area\n\nA Boca Chica local walks his talk in the small Texas town just a few miles from the border with Mexico\n\n'I think the actual danger to Boca Chica Village is low but is not tiny, so therefore we want super-tiny risk,' Musk said during his presentation.\n\n'Probably over time, better to buy out the villagers.'", "description": "Newly released video from Elon Musk's Space X shows how the company would turn a small town in Texas into a major hub for interplanetary travel built around its cutting edge Starship prototype.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19305984-0-image-a-10_1570206726238.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
