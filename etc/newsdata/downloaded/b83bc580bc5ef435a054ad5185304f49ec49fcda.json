She\u2019s 26 and has always used prescribed steroid creams, which improve it for a short period only. She cannot stop itching and is not sleeping well, and I fear it\u2019s getting her down. Is there anything else that could help?\n\nEczema is clinically known as atopic dermatitis and is characterised by dry, itchy, reddened areas of skin.\n\nYour granddaughter is unlucky, as although most people who have this condition develop symptoms as children, it usually abates in adulthood (thought to be due to age-related changes in the immune system).\n\nThere is a widely held belief that eczema is often down to a food allergy. But there may be a number of factors involved.\n\nEczema is clinically known as atopic dermatitis and is characterised by dry, itchy, reddened areas of skin\n\nPeople with eczema have a less stable epidermis \u2014 the outermost layer of skin, our first line of defence against allergens, bacteria, viruses and irritants. This makes it prone to inflammation and dryness.\n\nOn top of that, those with eczema (it\u2019s typically an inherited condition) often have allergies, too. That\u2019s why exposure to chemicals, including soaps, cosmetics, perfumes, wool, dust and tobacco smoke, may worsen the condition. But so can cold and dry conditions, emotional distress and even sweating.\n\nUnfortunately, as you will know, there is no \u2018cure\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s important first to eliminate any exacerbating factors such as low humidity environments that strip moisture from the skin, stress, anxiety and contact with solvents, soaps and detergents.\n\nRegular use of an emollient \u2014 a medical moisturiser \u2014 is also vital. Apply at least twice daily, and after every shower. This must be a lifelong strategy for your granddaughter. No prescription is needed for such creams, examples of which include Eucerin, Doublebase and Cetaphil daily lotion.\n\nThere is a widely held belief that eczema is often down to a food allergy. But there may be a number of factors involved\n\nResearch shows that emollients containing glycyrrhetinic acid, derived from liquorice root, have anti-inflammatory actions, which will help with the redness (for instance, Atopiclair, available over the counter).\n\nSuppressing the inflammatory response is essential \u2014 this is what the steroid creams you mention are for, and even the mildest are more powerful than glycyrrhetinic acid. But they can cause permanent thinning of the skin, so should be used only intermittently for acute flare-ups.\n\nThe face and skin folds are the areas most likely to be damaged by thinning, so strong steroids must be avoided at these sites. There are newer, non-steroid preparations which dampen the inflammatory response in the skin but without the thinning effect. These are known as calcineurin inhibitors but are only available on prescription. Tacrolimus is an example.\n\nHowever, these drugs do not act as rapidly as steroids, long-term use must be limited and your doctor\u2019s advice followed.\n\nI can offer two more suggestions. The first is referral for ultraviolet light therapy. Courses of this three times weekly have been proven to give relief.\n\nSecondly, staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium frequently found on the skin of people with chronic eczema, appears to drive its severity to some extent.\n\nBleach baths (half a cup of non-perfumed bleach in a full bath of warm water) may reduce symptoms by killing off bacteria. It could be worth trying this a few times a week for four weeks.", "description": "The Daily Mail's resident doctor answers your health concerns in his weekly column.
