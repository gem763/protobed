Now, in his (imminent) post-Apple life, Ive has delivered a fresh spin on the diamond ring.\n\nThe so-called \"(RED) Ring,\" which Ive designed alongside Marc Newsom, his partner in the new design firm LoveFrom, is made entirely out of diamond. The striking piece of jewelry is carved out of a larger block of diamond that was grown in a lab.\n\nThe ring sold at auction in Dec. 2018 for $256,250 during a Red charity event held during Art Basel in Miami.
