I didn't realize that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone that's married and loved, the father of what's about to be four kids. A corset is a form of underwear. It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who though?\"\n\nKANYE WEST ON FINDING FAITH DURING 2016 HOSPITALIZATION: I\u2019M \u2018NOW A SON OF GOD\u2019\n\nThe makeup and fashion mogul retaliated in her own defense, saying \"The night before [the Met Gala] you're going to come in here and say you're not into the corset look? You're giving me really bad anxiety... I don't need any more negative energy.\"\n\nTo that, Kanye replied, \"You are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.\"\n\nKardashian-West fired back and ended the argument by saying, \"You built me up to be a sexy person and have confidence! Just because you're on a journey and you're in a transformation, doesn't mean I'm in the same spot with you.\"\n\nAfter that, a visibly upset Kanye stormed out of the room muttering, \u201cOK.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, it seems that the argument eventually blew over and the superstar couple posed together on the red carpet at the Met Gala. Kardashian's \"wet\" look went on to be one of the most famous and discussed looks of the evening.\n\nFox News' Viktoria Ristanovic contributed to this report.", "description": "Kanye West addressed the backlash he received after commenting on his wife, Kim Kardashian-West, wearing sexy clothes that he said affected his soul.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP-Kanye-West-Service.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
