So I don't view it as a rivalry.'\n\nRory McIlroy admits Brooks Koepka 'wasn't wrong' to dismiss the idea of rivalry between them\n\nMcIlroy (centre) played alongside Brian O'Driscoll (left) in The Challenge in Tokyo on Monday\n\nThe last of McIlroy's four major titles came in the 2014 US PGA Championship, since when Koepka has won the US Open in 2017 and 2018 and the US PGA in 2018 and 2019.\n\nKoepka was also second in the Masters and US Open this year and fourth in the Open Championship at Royal Portrush, where an emotional McIlroy missed the cut on home soil.\n\n'What Brooks said wasn't wrong,' McIlroy said in an on-course interview with GOLF TV during the Japan Skins event.\n\nKoepka was asked last week about his rivalry with McIlroy and immediately dismissed it\n\nNorthern Irishman McIlroy says he didn't need reminding that he hasn't won major since 2014\n\n'I mean, he's been the best player in the world the last couple years - four majors. I don't think he had to remind me that I haven't won one in a while.\n\n'I love Brooks, he's a great guy. Obviously super-competitive, like we all are. I can see where he's coming from.\n\n'I think if you take what Brooks said out of context then it can become this big thing that it's become. But Brooks and I are good, we're good friends.'", "description": "Speaking ahead of his title defence at last week's CJ Cup in South Korea, world number one Koepka was asked about his rivalry with McIlroy and said: 'I've been out here for what, five years?", "authors": ["Phil Casey", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19987280-0-image-a-90_1571656195804.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
