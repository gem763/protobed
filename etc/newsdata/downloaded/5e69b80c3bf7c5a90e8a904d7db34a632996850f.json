Members want Labour to adopt a pro-Remain position in any referendum, but the ruling National Executive Committee wants to wait until after a general election to decide whether it would back a deal Corbyn negotiates with Brussels. The options hammered out at the meeting will be voted on by the main conference hall on Monday.\n\n\"Please remember why people voted leave, why people voted remain, but also remember there is more that unites all of those people \u2014 over austerity, over investment, over education, over housing, over health, over a green industrial revolution \u2014 than there is that divides them,\" Corbyn said in the interview.\n\nCorbyn, who is 70 years old, also said he would not step down midway through his term if he is elected prime minister.\n\nPOLITICO is hosting an exclusive happy hour event at the U.K. Labour Party Conference in Brighton on Monday September 23, featuring a live interview with Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Keir Starmer.
