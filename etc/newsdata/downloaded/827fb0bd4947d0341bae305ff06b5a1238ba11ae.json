You know what I\u2019m talking about: Forget your password, and you can regain access to your account by typing in the name of your first pet (Mr Mrglglrm), your favourite sports team (Saskatoon Sirens), or the street you grew up on (Third Street).\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard, these kinds of Q&As are horrible for security, because it\u2019s a lot easier for someone to figure out these answers than brute-force a complicated password or passphrase.\n\nThe obvious solution to this simple problem is to create dummy answers whenever you\u2019re forced to answer questions such as these, but there\u2019s a catch-22: Make up an outright lie, or some crazy combination of letters and numbers, and you might forget your fake answer when you need it most.\n\nAt best, you\u2019ll have to get in touch with the company and beg to regain access to your account; at worst, you\u2019ll have no way to verify that the account belongs to you, and you\u2019ll be out of luck.\n\nHere are a few ways you can tackle this problem, ranked in order of effectiveness:\n\nLie, But Only A Little Bit\n\nWhen a service asks you to type in the name of your first musical as an account security question, you don\u2019t have to tell the truth. If you first saw The Phantom of the Opera as a child, you could always say it was Hamilton. Or Heathers. Or don\u2019t even pick a musical at all. Go with The Nightmare Before Christmas (which really should be a musical, but I digress).\n\nAs long as you can remember your little white lie, it\u2019ll be harder for someone to break into your account by finding something you posted online that would give away the actual answer to the question at hand.\n\n'Starwars' And The 24 Other Worst Passwords Of 2017 You know those corny movie scenes, where someone hacks their boss or girlfriend or enemy's password by looking around the room and making two guesses? In real life, that would work way more often than it should. Check out this list of the 25 most-used, and thus most hackable, passwords of 2017. Read more\n\nTreat Your Q&A Like A Password Prompt\n\nIf you want to get a little crazier, you can always obfuscate your answer in a more creative way. Take Kate Kochetkova\u2019s approach, from the Kaspersky blog:\n\nIf you want, you can change the answer to even the worst security question ever such that nobody could guess it \u2014 what is your mother\u2019s maiden name? XCU*(&S1042! \u2014 but of course, you need to be careful not to confuse yourself as well. As a better option, you might take the maiden name Woodhouse and strip it down to the consonants: wdhs. Evenly intersperse the birth date 04.08.80 to get 04wd08hs80. Not a brilliant trick, but much better than the original.\n\nYou\u2019re now even more secure than before, as you\u2019re using some obscure combination of numbers and letters instead of a dictionary-guessable name.\n\nThat won\u2019t prevent a strong brute-force attack, but it\u2019ll at least beat anyone who is just typing in random permutations of cities, pet names, or whatever else the answer could have been.\n\nThe downside? Something like \u201cJ2uS*SD12(#..sfa!\u201d is going to be tricky to remember. And the last thing you should do is write it down somewhere \u2014 be it a sticky note on your monitor or a text file on your desktop \u2014 unless you\u2019ve placed your list of answers in a secure location. On to solution number three!\n\nHow To Create Secure Passwords That Aren't Impossible To Type How do you create a strong password? Easy. You mash your keyboard for a few seconds until you have a 50-character hunk of gibberish, then you copy and paste that into a password manager so you don't have to actually remember what it is. Read more\n\nUse A Password Manager To Store Your Q&As\n\nYes, your password manager isn\u2019t just for passwords. Assuming your LastPass or 1Password account is secured with a strong password itself, two-factor authentication, and any other tricks LastPass or 1Password offers, you can store answers to account questions in there, too. (Yes, there are many other options beyond LastPass and 1Password; those are just our favourites.)\n\nIf you\u2019re a LastPass user, you can drop your answers into the service\u2019s \u201cSecure Notes\u201d section (and require a password prompt to access it, if you want), or directly into the notes of any saved site:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nIf you\u2019re on 1Password, the process is similarly easy. Drop your answers into a secure note, or just create a custom field for any site entry, and leave your account recovery Q&As there. That\u2019ll look something like this:\n\nThe best thing about using password managers to store account security Q&As is that you can even have these apps create your answer for you. (An \u201canswer\u201d is just another password, after all.) If you do, you might need to chill out on the craziness \u2014 no symbols, for example \u2014 if the site or service you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t let you say that your first car was a \u201c[email protected] @$$US0RD\u201d.", "description": "It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had to type in some stupid answer to a made-up question when creating an account on a new service.
