A task that will last six days, the deal said.\n\nAt that moment Russian and Turkish forces will begin joint patrols 10km into the buffer-zone area.\n\nThe agreement, if successfully implemented, will likely herald the end of Turkey's incursion in northern Syria. It may also consolidate the Syrian government's hold over northeastern Syria which until two weeks ago had been controlled by Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin opened the Tuesday press conference saying that Moscow \u201cappreciates\u201d Turkey\u2019s national security concerns but insists \u201cSyria must be free from foreign military presence.\u201d\n\nMr Erdogan outlined the understanding saying: \u201dThe main aim of the operation is to take out PKK/YPG terror organisations from the area and to facilitate the return of Syrian refugees.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnkara regards the YPG as terrorists because of their affiliation with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is waging an insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\n\u201cThis operation also guarantees Syria territorial integrity and political unity. We never had any interest in Syria land and sovereignty,\u201d he added.\n\nThe two presidents met as a five-day cease-fire between Turkish troops and Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria was set to expire.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Many of them were pelted with vegetables by angry Kurdish residents as they crossed Syria's border into Iraq on Monday.\n\nFacing the Turkish incursion alone, the Kurds then struck a deal with President Bashar al-Assad to defend the borders.\n\nIt was a massive territorial win for the Assad regime who has deployed government troops to Kurdish-controlled areas for the first time in five years.\n\nUnder Tuesday\u2019s deal, government border guards would assist Russian forces in the YPG withdrawal. There has yet to be any official response from the Kurdish side.\n\nBut the Kurdish Red Crescent issued a desperate plea shortly before the agreement was announced, saying that their \u201ccapacity\u201d to meet a mounting humanitarian crisis \u201chad ended\u2019.\n\nThey said five hospitals and clinics were out of service and there there was not enough resources to look after the huge number of newly displaced.\n\n\u201cThere are no shelters, not enough food, not enough medicines, not enough drinking water. The water pipeline, which got hit by an airstrike and served more than 500,000 people, is still not functioning. These people have gone a week without a water supply,\u201d the statement added.", "description": "*/", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/22/19/gettyimages-1177642509.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
