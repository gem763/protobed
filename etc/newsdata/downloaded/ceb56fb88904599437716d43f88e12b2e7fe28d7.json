But South Sydney and Canberra have taken the relationship to brave new heights, as what was once a trickle of UK talent has now become a flood. The NRL has gone British in a big way and on Friday night history is likely to be made when a record seven English players, 20% of those on the field, clash in the preliminary final at GIO Stadium.\n\nThe Rabbitohs\u2019 Burgess brothers \u2013 Sam, Tom and George \u2013 will take on Raiders quartet Josh Hodgson, Elliot Whitehead, John Bateman and Ryan Sutton for a spot in the grand final. It\u2019s a clash that will captivate those not only in Australia, but on the other side of the world as well.\n\nNRL top four still standing despite twists on the path to prelims | Matt Cleary Read more\n\nWhile new arrivals Bateman and Sutton have caught the eye in the nation\u2019s capital this season, history tells us that English players in the NRL is not new. There were 12 across the competition this season \u2013 James Graham and Gareth Widdop at the Dragons, Ryan Hall at the Roosters, Kallum Watkins at Gold Coast and youngster Herbie Farnworth at Brisbane.\n\nBut the best British players have been heading down under for the best part of 50 years. In 1966 Flimby-born Test forward Dick Huddart helped St George win the grand final, becoming the first Briton to claim a premiership in Sydney. Three years later Wiganer Dave Bolton did the same with Balmain.\n\nIn the 1970s the catalyst was the hard-as-nails lock Malcolm Reilly, signed for a then world record fee of \u00a315,000. He helped Manly to back-to-back grand final victories in 1972 and 1973. Others soon followed as the potency of English talent was fully appreciated by Australian clubs \u2013 Phil Lowe, Steve Norton, John Gray, Roger Millward, Mike Stephenson and Bill Ashurst.\n\nAnother wave of transfers in the 1980s took place. Garry Schofield starred for Balmain and was followed to the club later by Andy Currier, Ellery Hanley and Shaun Edwards. This would gather pace around the competition with players such as Kevin Ward and Andy Goodway at the Sea Eagles, Lee Crooks at Western Suburbs, Joe Lydon and Martin Offiah at Eastern Suburbs, and Andy Gregory and Steve Hampson at Illawarra.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Canberra co-captain Josh Hodgson has been instrumental in the Raiders surge to within one game of the grand final.

I believed in my own ability and if I got the right service I was going to score tries. And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s there was only a handful of British players who ventured to Australia. But one forward was such a big hit at the turn of the century at the Roosters that he made Englishmen in demand again. Adrian Morley won the grand final in 2002, played in deciders in 2003 and 2004, and inspired a generation of his compatriots to follow.\n\n\u201cI always had aspirations to play in the NRL,\u201d Morley says. \u201cI got offered more to stay with Leeds. It wasn\u2019t a financial decision, it was just a challenge really. The NRL was regarded as the toughest competition in the world. I thought if I don\u2019t go now, I might not get another opportunity to go. I don\u2019t regret it for one moment, I loved every minute of it.\u201d\n\nMorley is proud that the likes of Gareth Ellis, Burgess and Graham followed his lead and became stars of the game in Australia. \u201cWhen you do go to Australia you do feel you have to prove yourself a little bit more,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a bit of a reputation in the UK but no one knew me in the NRL so I had to prove myself all over again \u2013 which was great as it gave me a chance to start again, and that was quite motivational for me.\n\nConfusion reigns over Israel Folau's potential return to rugby league | Matt Cleary Read more\n\n\u201cThe NRL is a lot more evenly contested with competition for places and the competition between other teams, so it does bring out the best in players. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with the English boys now.\u201d\n\nNow with the NRL salary cap growing exponentially and the appeal of an Australian lifestyle, Morley believes more Englishmen will take the plunge. Canberra have already signed up Wigan halfback George Williams for 2020. Expect more of his countrymen to follow suit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see a number of NRL clubs looking at the Super League trying to get some English players,\u201d Morley says. \u201cIt is a lot more lucrative now in the NRL. So it\u2019s just human nature that we\u2019ll be seeing daresay more British lads over there.\u201d", "description": "A record contingent will run out on Friday as Canberra and South Sydney honour a rich tradition of Englishmen down under", "authors": ["John Davidson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b53977233a7036ad17a396ef4ed49620ecdcc1/0_0_3813_2288/master/3813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4ed1c7de8ecea6d8455c74ccfdf21b3", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
