Though the financial terms weren\u2019t included in the court documents, the Department of Administration said Monday that the state\u2019s Risk Management division paid $212,500 to the woman who sued.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the woman said the school violated federal law by failing to assist her with reasonable accommodations after she reported that another student sexually assaulted her. The woman said UI officials told her she could transfer to another campus rather than move her attacker to a different class.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Idaho Department of Administration says the state paid more than $200,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by a former University of Idaho College of Law student against the school.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
