It had a shape and colour that was different from the soil around it, researchers said.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that the shiny gel could be a glass that formed when the original impact event formed the creator. The heat of that collision could have created the glass that was spotted by the lander, they suggested.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The lander has to shut down throughout the day because its parts could be damaged by the heat of the Sun when it comes directly overhead.\n\nAs that was happening, one of the team members spotted something strange in one of the panoramic photographs sent back by Yutu-2. They postponed the rover's nap and instead drove it to the crater to examine it.\n\nIt was there that they found that it was a shining substance that stood out from the soil around it. Despite further scans of the object, researchers were unable to find what it might be.", "description": "Scientists have found an unexplained, shiny gel on the far side of the Moon.
