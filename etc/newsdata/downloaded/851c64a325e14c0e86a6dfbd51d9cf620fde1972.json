(The small size of the drinks is a nod to the 5-foot-6 Altuve\u2019s diminutive stature, while Santa Teresa, like Altuve, comes from Venezuela.)\n\nThe only hitch: All World Series games start after 8 p.m. Because of Republic Cantina\u2019s liquor license, the bar can\u2019t serve alcohol after 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, or after midnight on Friday and Saturday, \u201cbut we\u2019ll stay open until the game is over,\u201d Svetlik says, with last call 15 minutes before the cutoff. (Think of it this way: You\u2019ll probably still be able to get a drink later than the fans in the stands.) Another reason to get there early: Happy hour, which runs from 5 to 7 p.m., includes $5 chile con queso, $5 Modelo beers and a choice of $8 margaritas.\n\nAnd Svetlik\u2019s prediction for this week? \u201cAstros all the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll call it in five [games].\u201d\n\nRepublic Cantina: 43 N St. NW.
