Zarrab was one of nine people charged in related cases, including the former Turkish economic minister.\n\nMehmet Atilla, Halkbank's former deputy general manager, also was convicted last year in a New York federal court on five of six criminal counts in one of the related cases.\n\n.", "description": "DOJ: Turkish bank charged in multi-billion scheme to evade Iranian sanctions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5229d19fd62b636bb2c64098c88008e823a7b9b/c=0-356-4253-2759/local/-/media/2016/04/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/635973597870389621-AFP-550336122.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
