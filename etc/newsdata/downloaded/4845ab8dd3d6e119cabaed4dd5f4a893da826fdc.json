The index formed a bullish hammer on the daily chart. This was the second straight weekly session when the index made lower highs and lows. Nifty is trading in a range of 2 moving averages: - 50 MA at 11,111 - 11,140 levels act as a resistance on a weekly closing basis --100 EMA at 10,780 level act as crucial support on a weekly closing basis Nifty has to hold above 10,800 to hold more downsides or lower levels and fresh up move start when nifty close above 11,150 on a weekly basis On 08-July-2019 Nifty breaks, 20 days EMA at 11,800 levels and from that level nifty falls more than 10% to 10,650 levels, shows major trend reversal in a bearish side. Nifty has to close above its 20 days EMA on a weekly closing basis to show trend reversal on a positive side for major upside at 11,450 levels at the end of this month. Index manages to hold ground around 10,900 zones and see some bounce back in last minutes to a close of 10,950 levels. Shows right shoulder is forming and nifty can move up towards 10,140 to complete and right shoulder and breakout from that level to form an inverted head and shoulder pattern. The weekly RSI stands at 40.83; it remains neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The weekly MACD stays bearish and remains below its signal line. The India VIX, which measures the implied volatility of Nifty 50 options, was down 5.78% to 16.2750.\n\nGLOBAL View:\n\nU.S. stocks mixed at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.26% Our main expectation is not at all that there will be a recession,\u201d either in the US or the global economy, Powell said Friday in Zurich during a question-and-answer session in which he was joined by Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan. US Labor Department reported employers added 130,000 new jobs in August, undershooting economists\u2019 estimates. U.S. Treasury yields have fallen in step with a global bond market rally as the trade war between China and the United States has kept recession fears on the horizon. Negative yields on government debt in countries such as Germany and Japan have also helped to depress those on U.S. Treasuries.\n\nCOMMODITY View:\n\nOil rose above $61 a barrel on Friday as hopes of progress in resolving the U.S.-China trade row boosted investor sentiment, although a report showing U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly increased weighed on prices. The Indian currency has appreciated by 67 paise in the last three trading sessions. On Friday, the rupee opened on a strong note at 71.87 and finally closed at 71.72, higher by 12 paise over its previous close.
