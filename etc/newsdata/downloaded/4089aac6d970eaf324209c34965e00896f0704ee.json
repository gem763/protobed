USA TODAY\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany \u2014 There are royal families with fewer titles than Simone Biles, and she\u2019s about to add to the collection.\n\nThe U.S. women are heavy favorites to win the team title at the world championships Tuesday night \u2014 their record-tying fifth in a row, for those of you keeping score. It would give Biles her 21st medal at the world championships, breaking a tie with Russia\u2019s Svetlana Khorkina for most by a female gymnast.\n\nWin three more \u2014 Biles has qualified for every event final as well as the all-around \u2014 and she becomes the most-decorated gymnast at worlds, male or female.\n\n\u201cI never think about the records,\u201d Biles said at the national championships in August. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know that I\u2019m breaking a record until somebody brings it up to me.\u201d\n\nBiles has played a significant role in the U.S. women\u2019s current run of dominance, accounting for at least a 2-point advantage in the Americans' winning margins over the Russians or Chinese. In a sport where medals are often decided by tenths, and sometimes hundredths, of a point, having her is a massive advantage.\n\nBut what makes the Americans so formidable is that they\u2019re not a one-woman show.\n\nSimone Biles of the U.S. performs on the floor during qualifying sessions for the Gymnastics World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, Saturday, Oct. 5, 2019.(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (Photo: Matthias Schrader, AP)\n\nIn the \u201cSimone Era,\u201d the Americans have won three world titles and an Olympic gold by 6.6 points or more. (The current winning streak started at the 2011 worlds, when Biles was still a junior.)\n\nThat means other gymnasts have stepped up, be it Kyla Ross, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, Madison Kocian or Morgan Hurd. At these worlds, Biles is getting backup from Jade Carey, Kara Eaker and first-year senior Sunisa Lee.\n\nThe contributions of these other gymnasts are essential, particularly given the scoring format in team finals.\n\nIn qualifying, four gymnasts compete on each event, and a country drops its lowest score. In team finals, however, it\u2019s three-up, three-count. Botch a routine, or have to use someone who can only post a mediocre score, and it puts a country in a hole.\n\nBiles gives the Americans a cushion, and a significant one, but she\u2019s only one score. Her teammates ensure the Americans will have at least one, and often two, more big ones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all just working toward the one goal,\u201d Carey said.\n\nAnd putting a dagger in Russia and China\u2019s hopes for an upset in the process.\n\nAs the top team in qualifying, the Americans start team finals on vault. Biles is the reigning world and Olympic champion on the event, while Carey leads the World Cup standings. (She actually scored better than Biles in qualifying.)\n\nAdd in a solid score from Grace McCallum, and the Americans have the potential of finishing their first event almost two points ahead of China and Russia.\n\nThink about that. Pretty much from the moment the meet starts, the Americans have China and Russia on their heels and playing catch up.\n\nRussia does have the potential to go higher than the United States on uneven bars and China can do the same on balance beam. But neither can score enough to erase the lead the Americans build up in the first event.\n\nEven if they do, the Americans finish up on floor, where they have the potential for another monstrous scoring advantage.\n\nBiles is the reigning world and Olympic champion on this event, too, while Carey also tops the World Cup rankings for floor. Lee posted the same score as Carey in qualifying, edging her for the second spot in the event final because of better execution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always known she\u2019s brilliant on bars and beam \u2026 but she also just moves so fluidly,\u201d national team coordinator Tom Forster said of Lee after the U.S. championships. \u201cShe\u2019s really coming into her full potential.\u201d\n\nAnd that's the secret to the Americans' reign. There's always another spectacular talent waiting to take her turn, and claim a title of her own.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "Led by Simone Biles, the US women are trying to win a fifth consecutive world title, which would tie Romania's record.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
