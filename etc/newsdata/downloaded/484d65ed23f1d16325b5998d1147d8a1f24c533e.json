To win that is very pleasing, and that means the pool is our own destiny.\n\n\u201cOur game-management has improved significantly. It was good in the autumn last year, and particularly in the Six Nations. We\u2019ve learnt a lot from those experiences.\n\n\u201cEven though we were under a lot of pressure in that second half, I thought our composure and fitness were really good and we soaked up a lot of pressure.\n\nGatland confirmed fly-half Dan Biggar failed a head injury assessment \u2013 he was replaced by Patchell during the first half \u2013 and that full-back Liam Williams rolled his ankle.\n\n\u201cDan failed an HIA,\u201d Gatland added. \u201cI had a chat with him afterwards.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s disappointed he had to come off, but it is important we go through the (HIA) protocols.\n\n\u201cRhys (Patchell) did a fantastic job for us. He\u2019s been criticised a lot for his defence in the past. We changed a few things about the way he defended, and I though his line speed was excellent.\n\n\u201cHe made some big tackles for us and controlled the game pretty well. It was a big match for him to come on early and get the win, and he will get a lot of confidence from that.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the toughest Test matches they\u2019ve played in a long, long time. We need to make sure we recover. It\u2019s nice getting a decent break before getting our next game against Fiji.\u201d\n\nWales looked home and dry when they led through tries by centre Hadleigh Parkes and scrum-half Gareth Davies, with Biggar and Patchell kicking 19 points between them including Patchell\u2019s 72nd-minute clincher.\n\nWing Adam Ashley-Cooper, full-back Dane Haylett-Petty and captain Michael Hooper claimed touchdowns for Australia, with Bernard Foley kicking a penalty and Matt Toomua booting seven points.\n\nBut Wales held out to claim victory and give their World Cup campaign considerable momentum.\n\n\u201cIt was just about winning, really. It wasn\u2019t about knockout stages,\u201d Gatland said.\n\n\u201cWe won some key turnovers towards the end of the game. It was pleasing to handle the six-day turnaround from the Georgia game, which wasn\u2019t an easy encounter.\n\n\u201cI want the guys to look after themselves tonight, but they deserve to pat each other on the back. It\u2019s a big confidence boost for the next couple of games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we prepare the best we can and don\u2019t take anything for granted. We\u2019ve got to be as clinical as you possibly can.\u201d", "description": "Wales boss Warren Gatland hailed his players\u2019 composure and fitness after they moved towards the World Cup quarter-finals with a memorable victory over Australia.
