No don't. Seriously, Ben. Honestly,\" cried Kate, who believed he had genuinely cut off her locks.\n\nCharlotte Hawkins could not believe what he had done, while Ben joked it wasn't as easy as he thought it would be.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nKate did not see the funny side and was convinced her hair had been ruined.\n\n\"That's not funny,\" exclaimed Kate. \"You can't do that to someone.

Oh crikey, it's going everywhere now.\"\n\nDespairing Kate asked if she had a massive hole in the back of her hair.\n\nEventually, Ben admitted that it was all a prank and he had used some hair extensions rather than cutting Kate's actual hair.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe confessed: \"Before anyone gets particularly carried away, don\u2019t worry it wasn\u2019t real.\n\n\"It's not real Kate Garraway. I pulled a fast one.\"\n\nKate admitted Ben had almost ruined their 20-year friendship with his antics and she nearly passed out.\n\nShe said: \"You nearly ruined a beautiful 20-year friendship. I was traumatised. I nearly feinted.\n\n\"You managed to get Brexit out of my mind. Maybe random haircuts are the solution.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nGood Morning Britain viewers took to Twitter after watching the hilarious moment.\n\nOne joker said: \"Snipping point\"\n\n\"These two should be on Thursdays as well,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Think she reactive very well most people would have smashed Ben shepherd\"\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "Fuming Kate told Ben he had ruined their 20-year friendship before discovering it was just a prank", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20645819.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RLP_MDG_18743JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
