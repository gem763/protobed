Before starting with any treatment, it\u2019s better to know what kind of acne you have. In the case of period acne, it helps if you can differentiate a hormonal break out from a regular acne. The easiest way to know the difference is the focus on the timing. Acne that\u2019s related to your period is more likely to flare up during the week or before it. Do you already have acne? You might notice that it gets worse during this time. If you have clear skin then you might notice a slight redness and pimples suddenly popping up. Before we move forward let us learn a little bit more about the type of blemishes that can occur on your skin. Don't Miss There are majorly six types of blemishes that can affect your skin during your periods. Blackheads: When a clogged pore remains open, the pimple rises to the surface of your skin and looks black.\n\nWhite Heads: These stay under the surface of your skin. They form when a blocked pore closes, causing the area to look white.\n\nPapules: This is a type of acne which is inflammatory. These are the small pimples those which seems red on the top. They also tend to hurt.\n\nPustules: This is another type of acne which is inflammatory acne, pustules are red at the bottom. The top are white if filled with pus.\n\nNodules: These form deep under the skin. They tend to be large, solid and painful. These are the ones which cover your face.\n\nCysts: This type of blemishes or acne are deeply rooted to the skin and filled with pus. They\u2019re painful and can cause scarring.\n\npixabay\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you get pimples before your period\n\nOh, damn those hormones!\n\nYour hormones fluctuate throughout your menstrual period cycle. Just before your period starts progesterone levels drop and estrogen levels rise. This can trigger your sebaceous glands to secrete more sebum, the oily substance that works as a lubricant for the skin. Too much sebum however can result in clogged pores and breakouts.\n\nYou know what else hormones do? They can result in growth of bacteria that cause acne and inflamed skin! These hormonal fluctuations just before your period may also be responsible for other fun period things, including moodiness, sore breasts, and emotional imbalance.\n\npixabay\n\nAcne down there\n\nSeeing any kind of lump anywhere near the vaginal area can be a little alarming. But before you panic, you should knowt that some people do say that they get breakouts before their period. Hormones are to be blamed for the breakouts in this area, but there are other possible period-related causes too. Menstrual pads, for instance, can rub against the skin, irritating your hair follicles and leading to ingrown hairs. All these problems can cause period acne.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to soothe your painful period pimples\n\nThe deep pimples and cysts that sometimes come with periods can be pretty painful for some, but there are things you can do to ease the pain. Trying out these would help.\n\nA warm compress for 10-15 minutes at a time, three or four times a day to soothe pain and it also helps to get the pus out.\n\nA cold compress or ice for 5 to 10 minutes at a time to relieve pain and swelling.\n\npixabay\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to avoid to prevent pimples from flaring up", "description": "As we all know periods are the most natural thing that happens to every woman and it is not taboo anymore.
