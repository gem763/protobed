REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nThe air and ground operation east of the Euphrates river in Syria could start at any time, President Tayyip Erdogan said.\n\nThe U.S.-backed force which controls the region, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) led by the Kurdish YPG militia, said it wanted stability but vowed to respond to any attack.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to turn any unprovoked attack by Turkey into an all-out war on the entire border to defend ourselves and our people,\u201d SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said.\n\nNATO allies Ankara and Washington agreed in August to set up a zone in northeast Syria along the border with Turkey, which considers the YPG a terrorist organisation linked to Kurdish insurgents at home.\n\nTurkey has accused the United States, which helped the YPG defeat Islamic State militants in Syria, of moving too slowly to create the zone. They are at odds over how far it should extend into Syria and who should control it.\n\nAnkara wants the zone to stretch 30 km (19 miles) inside Syria and to be cleared of YPG fighters. It has repeatedly warned of launching an offensive on its own into northeast Syria, where U.S. forces are stationed alongside the SDF.\n\nErdogan said Turkey aimed to \u201cwater the east of Euphrates with fountains of peace\u201d and settle refugees there.\n\n\u201cWe gave all warnings to our interlocutors regarding the east of Euphrates and we have acted with sufficient patience,\u201d he said at the opening of his AK Party\u2019s annual camp.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made our preparations, we\u2019ve completed our operation plans, given the necessary instructions.\u201d He added that air and ground actions could start \u201cas soon as today or tomorrow\u201d.\n\nREFUGEES\n\nAnkara says it wants to settle up to 2 million Syrian refugees in the zone, nearly halving the number sheltering in Turkey from Syria\u2019s more than eight-year conflict.\n\nHowever, the refugee transfer could face resistance from allies opposed to changing the demographic balance of the area. Kurdish leaders have previously accused Turkey of seeking to resettle mainly Arab Syrians from other parts of the country in their region - which Ankara denies.\n\nU.S. and Turkish troops have so far carried out half a dozen joint air missions over northeast Syria and three land patrols, including one on Friday. Washington deems these \u201cconcrete steps\u201d to address Ankara\u2019s concerns. Turkey says it is not enough.\n\n\u201cLand patrols, air patrols - we are seeing all of these are fiction,\u201d Erdogan said on Saturday.\n\nThe SDF, which has said it will pull back up to 14 km (8.7 miles) on some parts of the border, is committed to the agreements under U.S.-Turkish talks and will remain so if \u201cdangerous threats\u201d stop, its spokesman Bali said.\n\nKurdish commanders have warned that a Turkish border attack would lead to a resurgence of Islamic State militants, from which the SDF seized vast territory in north and east Syria.\n\n\u201cSimply, there will be a big gap in the towns that our forces will withdraw from to go to defend the border, and this will give Daesh the opportunity to return,\u201d Bali said.\n\nIn recent years, the Turkish military has launched two offensives with its Syrian insurgent allies in the northwest of the country and has forces stationed there.\n\nTurkey\u2019s rebel allies pledged on Friday to back an offensive by Ankara east of the Euphrates, blaming the YPG for displacing Arabs from the region.", "description": "Turkey will mount a military operation in northeast Syria, it said on Saturday, after accusing Washington of not doing enough to expel Syrian Kurdish fighters from its border.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437323576&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF94065", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
