But that's the impression you get in the media right now.\"\n\nThe organisation \"has found nothing in what he has written that involves attacks on civil society or respect for the equal value of all people\", they added. \"What we wonder is what sources the critics used and why Handke's own statements are ignored.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Nobel Literature Prize winner receives a medal, a diploma and \u00a3740,000 in prize money\n\nIn a 1996 book, Handke cast doubt on the Serbian massacre at Srebenica and accused the Bosnian Muslims of staging attacks. In a TV interview in 1999, he compared Serbia's fate to that of Jews during the Holocaust - although he later apologised for that \"slip of the tongue\". In 2006, he spoke at the funeral of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, who was accused of genocide and other war crimes.\n\n'An obvious choice'\n\nHowever, the Academy quoted a 2006 article in which Handke said the Srebrenica massacre was the worst crime against humanity in Europe since Word War Two.\n\nThe choice was also defended by Henrik Petersen and Rebecka K\u00e4rde, who sat on the Nobel Committee for Literature, which recommends the winners to the Swedish Academy.\n\nPetersen predicted that in the future, Handke would be considered \"among the most obvious choices\" for the prize. Writing in the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet, he described Handke as an advocate for peace and said he was \"anti-nationalistic\".\n\nK\u00e4rde said she didn't want to \"apologise for the hair-raising things that Handke has undoubtedly said and done\".\n\nHandke's anger\n\nShe explained: \"The Nobel Committee must read the texts on Yugoslavia among another 70 works written over a period of 50 years. Which we did.\" They concluded that the author of books including Repetition, My Year in the No-Man's-Bay and Die Obstdiebin \"absolutely deserves a Nobel Prize\".\n\nShe added: \"When we give the award to Handke, we argue that the task of literature is other than to confirm and reproduce what society's central view believes is morally right.\"\n\nHandke himself reacted angrily to the response to his win, telling journalists: \"No-one who comes to me says that he has read any of my works, that he knows what I have written. It's just questions like how does the world react, reactions to reactions.\"\n\nHe said he would never speak to the media again, according to Austrian broadcaster ORF.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
