The attack left the statue with a hole in its right horn.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Varlack has an attorney to speak for him.\n\nThe 7,100-pound (3,200-kilogram) bull was created by Italian-born artist Arturo Di Modica in 1989 and installed in lower Manhattan as a work of guerrilla art.\n\nDi Modica says the sculpture was his gift to America. It quickly became a popular attraction.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police say a Texas man bashed New York's Charging Bull statue with a metal object and damaged one of its horns.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/charging_bull_atatcked_62579_c0-293-3504-2336_s1770x1032.jpg?0bdc62c482639756986692281c2e08642885666e", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
