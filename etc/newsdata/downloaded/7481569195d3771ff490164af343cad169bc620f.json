The men, who have been friends \u2014 and, literally, partners in crime \u2014 for decades are Maurice Hearne and Charlie Redmond. They sit side by side as they wait, hoping to see and talk with Dilly Hearne, Maurice\u2019s daughter from whom he\u2019s been estranged for three years.\n\nNow 23, she is one of the hundreds of young people who roam around Europe in something like packs, often claiming to believe in Rastafarianism, having only their unconventional dress, dreadlocks and their fondness for dogs in common.\n\n\u201cIn Spain, the dead are more alive than the dead of any other country in the world.\u201d That Frederic Garcia Lorca quote, the epigraph, sets the book\u2019s tone.\n\nDilly could be arriving or departing; they don\u2019t know. They, her father and her honorary uncle, just want to see her, make sure she\u2019s okay, and ask why she won\u2019t stay in touch. Lots of luck, as parents of wayward youth who have been or still are \u201cin the wind,\u201d know only too well.\n\n\u201cAnd if the men are to see Dilly again,\u201d Mr. Barry writes, \u201cthey know that it depends also on fate\u2019s arrangements, and on the drifting insistencies of youth.\u201d\n\nSo as they sit and wait, their conversation reveals their common history, families, sex lives, loves gained and lost, all the things sad people talk about when forced to just sit and wait.\n\nBoth men been very successful in business, the business of smuggling drugs, and have enough put away to live on, even if it\u2019s a life and lifestyle greatly reduced.\n\nA few years back, in an attempt to \u201cgo straight,\u201d Maurice and Cynthia (Dilly\u2019s mother and Maurice\u2019s ex-wife) invested a small fortune, 485,000 pounds, in a beautiful mountainside plot of land where he started to build houses \u2014 but immediately ran into what sounds like an \u201conly in Ireland\u201d problem.\n\nAt the bottom of the plot there\u2019s a conspicuous mound. Some of the neighbors think it was once a \u201cfairy fort,\u201d and an ancient superstition dictates that if it\u2019s disturbed, bad luck will follow.\n\nAccording to a 2017 article in The Irish Times: \u201cAs the 1937-39 Schools\u2019 Collection of the National Folklore Archives makes abundantly clear every community in Ireland believed until recently in its local spirits, who lived in the surrounding bushes, banks and, in particular, the fairy forts.\n\n\u201cAfter eons (potentially millennia) of living side-by-side with these spirits, aka the Little People, Gentry, the Good People or S\u00edoga, and coping with their divilish interferences in our lives and landscapes we have now cast them aside over the course of a few paltry decades.\u201d\n\nBut not in Charlie\u2019s case. On the first day of construction, a strong young laborer broke his leg, on the second, \u201c\u2026 some [fricking] eejit with a kango hammer nearly took the marriage prospects off himself,\u201d and three days later another worker had \u201ca mini stoke while mixing bags of sand and gravel.\u201d So much for the project.\n\nMaurice (aided by Charlie) consoled himself with whiskey and heroin. Now, years later, all they both want is to see Dilly again and make sure she\u2019s alright.\n\nThere was a tiny lake island that sat there oddly, as though unsure of its purpose in the greater scheme. Above the Maumturks were the most sober mountains. The Maumturks had slow, blank, unobliging faces. Maurice and Cynthia loved each other out there.\n\nThat fairly typical passage occurs on page 73, by which time the reader is, or should be, attuned to the arrangement and tone of the author\u2019s prose style. It\u2019s very Irish, by which I mean lyrical, even lilting, with certain passages reading much like poetry, and it moves the story along at a fast clip.\n\nGiven that this fictional work by an Irishman features two men on a bench, sitting and waiting for someone to appear, comparisons to Samuel Beckett\u2019s great play \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d are inevitable, but off the mark. The play closes with no resolution, whereas in this book \u2026 But I won\u2019t do that as it would spoil things for the reader.\n\nThe pleasure to be found in this relatively short book is in the telling, plus the author\u2019s clear evocative prose that often deploys lines and paragraphs that suggest music \u2014 but it\u2019s not the speedy pace of step dancing. Rather it is the sad, slow, and beautiful music of time. But there are similarities. The book\u2019s message is not existential; instead it is fundamentally human, and the reader is left with a feeling of hope, not hopelessness.\n\n\u2022 John Greenya, a Washington writer and critic, is the author of \u201cGorsuch: The Judge Who Speaks For Himself\u201d (Simon and Schuster, 2018).\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nNIGHT BOAT TO TANGIER\n\nBy Kevin Barry\n\nDoubleday, $25.95, 255 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
