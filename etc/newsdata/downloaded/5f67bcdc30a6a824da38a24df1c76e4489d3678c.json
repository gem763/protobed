And that\u2019s what I believe I took the most from.\u201d\n\nThe next two years will be daunting for track and field , as it tries to regain - or retain - its niche in the post-Bolt landscape. This week marks the beginning of the first world championships without Bolt since 2003. In less than a year, track will take its act to the Olympics, sans Bolt, for the first time since 2000.\n\nLyles knows there will be comparisons. Two months ago, he ran 19.50 in the 200 meters, the distance Bolt considered his specialty and at which he holds a world record - 19.19 seconds - that many in the sport feel will be hardest to top.\n\nBut Lyles, the charismatic sprinter - sound familiar? - who grew up in Florida before moving to Virginia, isn\u2019t daunted by that.\n\nAnd while Lyles will be trying for three gold medals at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics - in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay, a la Bolt - he\u2019s focusing solely on the 200 at world championships , because, in his words, \u201cI have a very strong chance of winning that 200. I also have a very strong chance of trying to break some meet records.\u201d (Bolt\u2019s world record was set at world championships in 2009).\n\nIf he does, then the track world will certainly want to scoop up every little tidbit it can about its newest, fastest man.\n\nAmong them:\n\nLyles is an apparel designer (check out his socks collection ) and a budding musician who produced a hip-hop album that focuses on the cycle teenagers go through in acting out. He considers himself a cross between Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Kanye West and Jaden Smith.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to find my own flow,\u201d Lyles said.\n\nWhether it was on the track, or on the dance floor, or spinning records at his own dance club in Kingston, few were able to make the switch between the athletic field and the nightclub as seamlessly as Bolt. In fact, sometimes they felt like one and the same.\n\nThough the comparisons are sure to come in all these venues, the 5-foot-11 Lyles believes there\u2019s a benefit to never having lined up, mano a mano, against the 6-foot-5 Jamaican.\n\n\u201cIt helps my career being able to say that I wasn\u2019t beaten by Bolt,\u201d said Lyles , who along with his younger brother, Josephus, signed a long-term deal with Adidas in 2016, passing on a chance to run at the University of Florida. \u201cIf I (had been), then I would have that overwhelming gloom of, \u2018Oh, but you got beat by Bolt that one time.\u2019 And then you\u2019d have that conversation of, \u2018Oh, but I was only 19.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey did meet once - in a doctor\u2019s office in Germany before the 2017 world championships. Lyles, who was there to get his hamstring checked out, went over Bolt in the waiting area and introduced himself.\n\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s a cool guy,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cHe\u2019s got world records.\u201d\n\nCould those records someday belong to Lyles? And if they do, could he be the sort of personality who would make people want to watch?\n\n\u201cHe just wants to be the first Noah Lyles and that\u2019s all he thinks about,\u201d his coach, Lance Brauman, said. \u201cHe\u2019s not caught up in the rigmarole about saving the sport - or being the next this or being the next that.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the personality, has a lot of talent and likes to train. He\u2019s got a few good qualities right there.\u201d\n\nHe certainly stands out in a crowd - spraying his hair silver will tend to do that (he did that for U.S. championships and plans to again in Doha).\n\nHe certainly can dance, too, breaking out a few moves after winning at nationals. Then, he posed for pictures with fans. He was in no hurry to leave the stage.\n\n\u201cNoah\u2019s a rock star,\u201d said Justin Gatlin, the reigning 100-meter world champion. \u201cHe likes to put on a show.\u201d\n\nIn short, Lyles gets it: Lots of people run fast. But Bolt\u2019s celebrations are what made the victories so memorable.\n\n\u201cI could be the fastest and I could have the most medals, but are they going to remember that when I leave? Probably not,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cBecause somebody else is going to come by and do the same thing. But everybody will remember Bolt\u2019s personality.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The most promising signal that track and field remains in good hands even after Usain Bolt's retirement comes from a 22-year-old American named Noah Lyles , who appreciates the Jamaican superstar more for what he did after his races than during them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/worlds_noahs_arc_athletics_95177_c0-209-5000-3124_s1770x1032.jpg?d90e3d455f0268dece892f6c8cc4108909694c0b", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
