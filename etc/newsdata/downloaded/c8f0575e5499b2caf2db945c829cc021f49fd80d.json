Named after the British yachtswoman who set a record for circumnavigating the globe, it focuses on shifting the economy to a circular model that eliminates waste.\n\nAndrew Morlet, the foundation's chief executive, said it had previously worked closely with companies, governments and cities and the education system.\n\n\"The finance sector is a very important part of accelerating this transition,\" he said.", "description": "BlackRock bets on the circular economy with new fund", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9711C_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
