With the couple\u2019s final scenes approaching, Danny Miller previews what\u2019s to come.\n\nAfter the police were unable to bring a case against Lee for what he did to Victoria, Robert set out to seek revenge on behalf of his sister. He attempted to humiliate the rapist \u2014 amongst other things \u2014 but in the end he lost control and lashed out, hitting him with a shovel \u2014 an action which resulted in him being charged with GBH with intent.\n\nIn the coming episodes, Lee dies as a result of his injuries, and it\u2019s up to Victoria to relay this information to her brother. Robert\u2019s distraught but \u2014according to Danny \u2014 so is Aaron, as it\u2019s here that the realisation sets in that he may have to live his life without his beloved husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He feels sick with dread to hear about Lee. He he has grown up a bit recently and realised he has to be there for his family especially Liv and Seb. If Robert is going down, which seems inevitable to the pair of them, he knows he is going to have to pick up both roles and be strong for Liv and Seb.\u2019\n\nDetermined to help her family, Liv (Isobel Steele) offers up a solution and suggests that both Robert and Aaron could go on the run together and \u2014 after some deliberation \u2014 the pair shockingly agree on this course of action. Bidding adieu to their families proves to be a tall task \u2014 especially considering they\u2019ve so little time to do so.\n\nDanny said: \u2018The goodbyes are rushed. You can see that Aaron and Robert almost don\u2019t have time to take in the emotion due to the rush and panic. The police are essentially on their way, it\u2019s all so quick, it\u2019s a serious crime so he can\u2019t be out on bail. They both say their individual goodbyes but I don\u2019t think they realise this could be the final time they speak to people, it certainly doesn\u2019t hit Robert until he gets in the car.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a romantic \u201clets run off into the sunset together!\u201d They have had no time to plan this, they just have to grab their things and go. Aaron has connections in France, he has inherited Cain\u2019s contacts so it is possible they could make it work there. He takes control for a change which is nice and Robert is happy to let him do that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Robert and Aaron having proven to be one of the most popular soap couples of all time, it\u2019s safe to say that fans will be upset to see their love story come to an end. Little is known about how the narrative will come to an end, but Danny has already starting filming some of the pair\u2019s final moments.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve done some of it and there\u2019s real raw emotion there for Ryan and myself. During one of the emotional scenes, it hit me that it\u2019s real and it\u2019s actually happening and there are some genuine tears in there. \u2018\n\nIt\u2019s been amazing working with Ryan. It\u2019s been full on and we sometimes get on each others nerves but we just work so well together. We have a level of trust and understanding that I will really miss. We have great chemistry on screen and right from our first scene I felt and I guess the producers must have seen it too.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "'There's real raw emotion there.'", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/robert-aaron-exit-emmerdale-474747-ebdb_1569846100.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
