He Says He Wants Nuclear Weapons.", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan , wants more than control over a wide swath of Syria along his country\u2019s border. He says he wants the Bomb.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to his order to launch the military across the border to clear Kurdish areas, Mr. Erdogan made no secret of his larger ambition. \u201cSome countries have missiles with nuclear warheads,\u201d he told a meeting of his ruling party in September. But the West insists \u201cwe can\u2019t have them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, I cannot accept.\u201d\n\nWith Turkey now in open confrontation with its NATO allies, having gambled and won a bet that it could conduct a military incursion into Syria and get away with it, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s threat takes on new meaning. If the United States could not prevent the Turkish leader from routing its Kurdish allies, how can it stop him from building a nuclear weapon or following Iran in gathering the technology to do so?\n\nIt was not the first time Mr. Erdogan has spoken about breaking free of the restrictions on countries that have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and no one is quite sure of his true intentions. The Turkish autocrat is a master of keeping allies and adversaries off balance, as President Trump discovered in the past two weeks.", "description": "A month before invading Kurdish areas in Syria, Turkey\u2019s president said he \u201ccannot accept\u201d the West\u2019s restrictions that keep him from a bomb.", "authors": ["David E.
