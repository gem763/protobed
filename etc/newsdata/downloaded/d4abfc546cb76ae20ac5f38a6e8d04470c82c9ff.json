So, naturally, Fox News figures are already questioning Vindman\u2019s loyalty to our country \u2014 or, more precisely, to Trump himself.\n\nAD\n\nEvidently, placing country before Trump is the ultimate act of supreme betrayal.\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony will be important. As a member of the National Security Council, he\u2019ll be the first White House official to testify that he listened in on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky \u2014 and was profoundly disturbed by it.\n\nAD\n\nOn that call, of course, Trump corruptly pressured Zelensky to validate conspiracy theories undermining the confirmed fact of Russian sabotage of the 2016 election on Trump\u2019s behalf, and to help Trump rig the 2020 election by smearing Biden.\n\nIn his opening statement, Vindman says he \u201cdid not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen.\u201d Vindman is a decorated lieutenant colonel, so when he delivers this message once the inquiry moves into its public phase, it could be very compelling.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Vindman will blow a big hole in one of Trump\u2019s most important defenses.\n\nVindman discusses a key meeting on July 10 with Ukrainian officials, who expressed their desire for a Trump-Zelensky meeting. Vindman then says Gordon Sondland \u2014 the ambassador to the European Union \u2014 \u201cstarted to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat further nails down part of the quid pro quo. But there\u2019s more. Sondland\u2019s demand prompted then-national security adviser John Bolton to \u201ccut the meeting short.\u201d Then Vindman testifies that this happened:\n\nFollowing this meeting, there was a scheduled debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma. I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\n\nVindman adds that Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former Russia adviser, also informed Sondland that this was inappropriate.\n\nAD\n\nAll of this comports with Hill\u2019s own testimony that Bolton was so irate about what he\u2019d heard that he referred to it as a \u201cdrug deal\u201d that Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were \u201ccooking up.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s notable here is Vindman\u2019s assertion that in that subsequent debriefing, they discussed the demand for an investigation into the Bidens in particular. As Ryan Goodman notes, this contradicts Sondland\u2019s own testimony that he didn\u2019t recall any discussion of the Bidens, so Sondland may be legally exposed now.\n\nAD\n\nHere\u2019s why this matters. One key Trump defense has been to claim that all he wanted was for Ukraine to investigate generic corruption. That\u2019s belied by the fact that Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph Giuliani repeatedly and publicly called on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens going back to at least May \u2014 and that Trump named Biden on the July 25 call \u2014 but put that aside for now.\n\nAD\n\nOne big revelation from William Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, is that he testified that Sondland had privately noted internally that Trump was demanding that Zelensky publicly announce an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nSo here we have Vindman, a sympathetic witness, offering further corroboration of just how well understood it was that the Bidens, not generic corruption, were the real target of the \u201cinvestigations\u201d Trump wanted. Trump again just raged that there was nothing wrong with his call, but this defense is collapsing.\n\nAD\n\nWhich brings us to Fox News\u2019s smear of Vindman.\n\nThe Fox smear\n\nFox\u2019s Laura Ingraham unleashed a diatribe against Vindman on Monday night that focused on the fact that Ukrainians privately solicited Vindman\u2019s help in navigating difficulties created by Giuliani running this shadow policy toward Ukraine. Watch:\n\nAD\n\nOh my God, look at the spin they are using right now, actually saying that Vindman is a Ukrainian double agent....this is so freaking bananas pic.twitter.com/Oxpju5W23N \u2014 Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) October 29, 2019\n\n\"Here we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interests,\u201d Ingraham railed. Former George W. Bush administration lawyer John Yoo called this potential \u201cespionage.\u201d\n\nNote here Ingraham\u2019s frank admission that Vindman was working against the president\u2019s interests.\n\nYou see, Giuliani\u2019s shadow policy toward Ukraine was not in the interests of the United States. It was in Trump\u2019s interests. Giuliani himself declared in May that this scheme would be \u201cvery helpful to my client.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIngraham is unwittingly admitting the obvious here: In trying to keep our foreign policy aligned with our own national interests, Vindman was operating against those of the president. And this is the real betrayal for which Vindman must be destroyed.\n\nAD\n\nTrump isn\u2019t operating in our interests\n\nAlong these lines, note Vindman\u2019s testimony that the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d at the core of the Trump-Giuliani effort was \u201charmful\" to the United States, because it undermined U.S. efforts to \u201cexpand cooperation with Ukraine\u201d and \u201clock in Ukraine\u2019s Western-leaning trajectory\" as a bulwark against Russia. The narrative, and the use of Ukraine as a pawn to serve Trump\u2019s political interests, is good for Trump (and Russia). But it\u2019s bad for the United States and Western liberal democracy.\n\nVindman, then, will join numerous long-serving government professionals who have stepped forth to declare that Trump\u2019s interests and those of the United States have vastly diverged \u2014 and that Trump and his ringleaders have perverted and manipulated our foreign policy to serve his interests, and not ours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Placing country before Trump is the ultimate betrayal.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e0opisEA7sGF6E7RiWo_nePZ5ms=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BFJOHPH2KAI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
