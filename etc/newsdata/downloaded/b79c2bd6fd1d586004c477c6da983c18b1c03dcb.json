Not only does Johnson first have to strike a bargain with the European Union \u2014 itself a difficult task \u2014 he then must sell it at home. British domestic politics can be unforgiving, as Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May learned after making a deal with Brussels only to have it defeated three times in Parliament.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe key sticking point in the closed-door talks in Brussels was the future of Northern Ireland, which will depart the E.U. along with the rest of the United Kingdom. Both the U.K. and the E.U. say they want to keep open the border with the Republic of Ireland, to preserve the hard-won peace there. They have disagreed about how to achieve that, with the E.U. saying Northern Ireland would have to remain tightly aligned with its own rules.\n\nMay had said \u201cno U.K. prime minister would ever agree to\u201d a proposal that would create a customs border in the Irish Sea. And Johnson had resisted the idea. But on Tuesday, he seemed to be moving far closer to European demands in a bid to push the talks to a conclusion.\n\nE.U. leaders will meet in Brussels Thursday and Friday, when they will either sign off on a deal, agree to delay the Brexit date beyond October or brace for a sudden and uncontrolled British departure from the bloc.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarnier told reporters ahead of the marathon negotiations: \u201cEven if the agreement will be difficult, more and more difficult, to be frank, it is still possible this week.\u201d\n\nOne European diplomat involved in the negotiations said late Tuesday that \u201cthere is light in the tunnel, but for the moment it comes from only neon tubes, not from the exit.\u201d The diplomat spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.\n\nThe Irish border has proved to be one of the most vexing issues facing negotiators over the past three years. The promise of an open border is central to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles, as the 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland are known.\n\nAD\n\nToday the boundary is mostly invisible. A driver whizzing between Belfast and Dublin is not required to stop for any customs check or security control. There are no tollbooths, no cameras, not even a signpost. Brexit could change all that. If the United Kingdom has its own set of tariffs and regulations, Europeans would demand a customs border to prevent smuggling and ensure the integrity of their own internal market.\n\nAD\n\nBut both sides fear it could lead to violence.\n\nWhile the sweeping, E.U. bureaucratic hub of the Berlaymont building in Brussels was busy with Brexit talks, so too was Johnson\u2019s official residence at 10 Downing Street, where ministers and lawmakers dashed in and out all day Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nBy some counts, compared to May, Johnson would face an even tougher vote in the House of Commons. His Conservative Party no longer holds a majority, and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has warned that his Labour Party will not support Johnson\u2019s \u201cTory Brexit,\u201d no matter the details (though some Labour rebels have signaled they might just back a deal).\n\nThe most hard-line Brexiteers, known as the \u201cSpartans,\u201d may also rise up against any deal that crosses their red lines.\n\nBut there were signals that the Tories might rally behind their new prime minister.\n\nAD\n\nSteve Baker, leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), left a meeting Tuesday at 10 Downing Street telling reporters outside that he was \u201coptimistic that it is possible to reach a tolerable deal that I am able to vote for.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe former leader of the ERG and now leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, pleaded with fellow Conservatives to trust Johnson because \u2014 unlike May \u2014 he is a true Brexiteer, a leader of the winning June 2016 campaign to leave the European Union.\n\nRees-Mogg said Parliament was desperate for a deal.\n\nHe was asked by Sky News over the weekend if he would vote for a deal similar to May\u2019s customs partnership deal, which he once called \u201ccompletely cretinous.\u201d\n\nRees-Mogg conceded that he may have to \u201ceat my words.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthere\u2019s a line from Churchill saying that he often had to eat his words and he found it to be a very nourishing diet, and that is something that happens in politics.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven tougher for Johnson and any deal he crafts are the 10 lawmakers from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from Northern Ireland, who have opposed any kind of Brexit deal that would see the Irish province treated differently than England, Wales and Scotland, their fellow nations in the U.K.\n\nArlene Foster, the DUP leader, visited Johnson again on Tuesday night, and before entering 10 Downing promised she would \u201cdo what\u2019s best for the union.\u201d\n\nAfterward, a DUP spokesman said: \u201cIt would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required,\u201d seemingly splashing a bit of cold water on hopes that a deal would be reached in the evening.\n\nBooth reported from London.
