LOVE her. I actually fucking hate Gogglebox so I was expecting to hate her, but she\u2019s too delightful and honest to dislike. One thing though \u2013 Angie, beb, it\u2019s hooley dooley not holy dooley and if you say the latter one more time, I swear\u2026\n\nTo recap \u2013 Angie has said \u201choly dooley\u201d multiple times in this Bachelorette season\u2019s two episodes. We\u2019re not even one tenth into this show and I\u2019m already having my ears accosted and my blood boiled by this wrong turn of phrase.\n\nI just assumed everyone knew holy dooley was incorrect, but apparently this isn\u2019t true. Like I saw this on Twitter, for example:\n\nAs @hotchook69 pointed out, Angie is representing \u201choly dooley\u201d which is the correct phrase, not \u201chooley dooley.\u201d An icon. #BacheloretteAU \u2014 Bec Shaw (@Brocklesnitch) October 9, 2019\n\nAnd then someone in the All Aussie Mystery Hour podcast group started a poll, which is going well but still has an alarming amount of \u201choly dooley\u201d voters:\n\nTHIRTY SIX PEOPLE BELIEVE DEEP IN THEIR SOUL, INCLUDING MY FRIEND AMY UP THERE, THAT HOLY DOOLEY IS A THING.\n\nThankfully, my colleagues are a more normal bunch. I asked them to vote with emoji for the right term.\n\nThank god I work with people who don\u2019t have brain worms (except for the two who voted for holy dooley. I see you.)\n\nWhile I cannot fathom the type of brain that thinks it\u2019s holy dooley, I\u2019m not going to sit here and yell at you all without some facts behind me.\n\nObviously I had to investigative journalism this bitch.\n\nThrowing \u201cis it holy dooley or hooley dooley\u201d into Google got me to Phrases.co.uk, who are telling me the correct AUSSIE way is hooley.\n\nWell, some rando in their forum is at least.\n\nI mean the fact they\u2019ve just completely made up a \u201cvariation in a jewish accent\u201d is enough grounds to dismiss this entire post. So I hit up urbandictionary.com.\n\nAlarming news.\n\nI mean, we have to go with the one that has the most thumbs ups, right?\n\nNo, I cannot concede. I need more information. How about Australiaday.com.au!\n\nFinally we\u2019re getting somewhere. The site is even run by the government! Great news! I don\u2019t really understand it\u2019s point but who cares!\n\nOutbackdictionary.com also coming up with the truth.\n\nSo to summarise this essay, Outback Dictionary + government-run Australia Day website > everything else.\n\nAlso, just my opinion > everything else, haha I lied! I AM just going to blindly believe my truth and ignore any arguments!", "description": "I stand by this - while Angie Kent from The Bachelorette says \"holy dooley\" it is, in fact, \"hooley dooley\" and nothing will convince me otherwise.", "authors": ["Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-11-at-11.35.11-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
