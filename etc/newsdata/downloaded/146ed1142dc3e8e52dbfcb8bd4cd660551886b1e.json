The whistle-blower complaint painted Giuliani as operating outside diplomatic channels, at times actively undercutting U.S. envoys.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry ramps up, Giuliani and other Republicans have attempted to flip the narrative away from Trump and onto discredited claims of wrongdoing by Biden and his son, a lobbyist who served for years on the board of Burisma Holdings, one of the largest natural gas companies in Ukraine.\n\nThe elder Biden has been the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination since jumping into the race, in large part because he\u2019s seen as the most electable candidate against Trump. The regular drumbeat of commentary and confusion about Trump and Ukraine may dent Biden\u2019s support.\n\nGiuliani made three television appearances on Sunday alone, on ABC, CBS and Fox, spots that Biden\u2019s campaign said were riddled with \u201ccompletely baseless suggestions\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s work in China as well as Ukraine.\n\n\u201cGiuliani is not a public official, and holds no public office that would entitle him to opine on the nation\u2019s airwaves,\u201d the Biden campaign wrote. \u201cThe decision to legitimize his increasingly outlandish and unhinged charges and behavior -- calling it \u2018news\u2019 -- rests solely with you.\u201d\n\nThe letter marked an escalation from Biden\u2019s campaign. The former vice president, at a news conference in Delaware on Tuesday, dismissed allegations of about wrongdoing in Ukraine as a \u201csmear.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ros Krasny in Washington at rkrasny1@bloomberg.net;Tyler Pager in Washington at tpager1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Ludden at jludden@bloomberg.net, Ian Fisher, Linus Chua\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s campaign implored the U.S. media on Sunday to stop booking Rudy Giuliani, who responded on Twitter that the former vice president was arrogant and entitled in \u201cdemanding\u201d to silence him.", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
