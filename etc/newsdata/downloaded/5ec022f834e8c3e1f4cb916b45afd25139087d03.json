I cannot be happy with what I have at the moment. I am 33 but I still have several good years left in me.\n\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard has opted for Tammy Abraham over Giroud as his main striker\n\n'I still have the legs and a profile that I think will enable me to keep playing at the top level. I feel in good shape physically and I lead a healthy lifestyle. I want to enjoy myself and play matches.\n\n'That could be for Chelsea \u2013 who are my first choice \u2013 or elsewhere. But if they force me to make a decision I will do it \u2013 just like when I left Arsenal.'\n\nAccording to The Sun, Inter Milan are keeping tabs on the World Cup winner's situation and Antonio Conte may offer him a route out of west London should his situation not improve.\n\nFrance boss Didier Deschamps is also keen to see Giroud get more minutes for his club and hinted he may have to ply his trade elsewhere.\n\nFrance boss Didier Deschamps is also keen to see Giroud get more minutes for his club\n\n'You know, Olivier suffers his situation.
