But it did so without a key component\u2014the carrier itself.\n\nDue to electrical maintenance, the USS Harry S. Truman stayed home, missing its scheduled deployment.\n\nThat\u2019s significant, because every other carrier strike group\u2014aircraft carriers included\u2014has been fully deployed from the East Coast since 2006.\n\nAircraft carriers are an important tool for projecting power abroad. Imposing and powerful, they provide a movable airfield to hot spots around the globe and project forward naval presence, along with their escort ships.\n\nThe Truman staying home is a big loss for U.S. naval capability.\n\nTwo key issues currently plague the sustainment of the Navy: inadequate funding for repairs and a shortage of dry docks, where repairs are conducted.\n\nFirst, the Navy currently faces a $1.8 billion roadblock to achieving full naval readiness.\n\nAccording to the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., other defense priorities have consumed the funds that would have covered the $1.8 billion maintenance-funding shortfall.\n\nSecond, dry-dock shortages prevent timely repairs. The Navy\u2019s long-range plan for maintenance and modernization of naval vessels for fiscal 2020 observes that docks are overloaded.\n\nSome 109 vessels are already competing for 21 aging dry docks on the East Coast, where the Truman is being serviced.\n\nInsufficient funding and porous infrastructure slows the U.S. response to emerging threats and decreases its capability to deter future threats.\n\nResulting from sparse resources, project delays limit our global reach. Data between 2012 and 2018 reveal that 70% of naval repairs were not finished on time.\n\nFor example, the USS George H.W. Bush, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was ready for deployment nearly a year-and-a-half after its maintenance\u2019s scheduled completion.\n\nBefore the USS Harry S. Truman\u2019s deployment was delayed, the Navy already found that it couldn\u2019t meet the long-established standard of deploying two aircraft carriers while having three others ready to spring into action within 30 days, hindering the Navy\u2019s deployment agility.\n\nThe USS Harry S. Truman\u2019s postponed deployment also disrupts current naval missions. Taking the aircraft carrier out of play may place more strain on its deployed counterpart, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which is America\u2019s only currently deployed aircraft carrier.\n\nTom Callender, a former senior research fellow for defense programs at The Heritage Foundation, noted in a 2018 report that while full naval deployment isn\u2019t always possible, the United States should aim to maximally deploy its fleets so it can respond to threats on time.\n\nBut delayed projects and backlogging prevent the taking on of unexpected challenges. Adm. William Moran, vice chief of naval operations, emphasized that \u201ctoo much time for maintenance has a negative impact on meeting planned training and operational schedules, and the corresponding negative impact on the readiness of our sailors to fight.\u201d\n\nWhile increasing threats and dwindling resources define the Navy\u2019s current battlefield, the solution does not lie in retiring older ships such as the USS Harry S. Truman, as The Heritage Foundation\u2019s previous naval reports explain.\n\nRather, the infrastructure that receives, repairs, and then redeploys our naval vessels deserves greater investment.\n\nA forward naval presence cannot be realized without providing resources to maintain a world-class Navy.\n\nEspecially as Russia and China fortify their navies, U.S. superiority will be solidified with greater investment in our naval capacities.", "description": "A U.S. carrier strike group recently deployed.
