Yet the company has sold 100,000 of the devices and now has attracted $15 million in series A funding from Spark Capital.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual trajectory for a hardware startup exploring a nearly unoccupied market, but CEO Magnus Wanberg is confident that\u2019s because this category of device is destined to grow in response to increasingly invasive tech. Sometimes an anti-technology trend is the tech opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nI reviewed the reMarkable last year and compared it with its only real competition, the Sony Digital Paper Tablet. It was launched not on Kickstarter or Indiegogo but with its own independent crowdfunding campaign \u2014 and considering we\u2019ve seen devices like this attempt such a thing and either let down or rip off their backers, that alone was a significant risk.\n\nThe device has been a runaway success, though, selling over 100,000 units \u2014 and attracting investment in the process. When I talked with Wanberg and co-founder Gerst about their new A round, the conversation was so interesting that I decided to publish it in full (or at least slightly edited).\n\nHow did they get here? What would they have done differently? Is the threat of the \u201csmart\u201d world really a thing? Why fight tech with more tech?\n\nDevin: So you guys raised some money, that\u2019s great! But it\u2019s been a while since we talked. I think it\u2019s important to hear about the progress of unique companies that are doing interesting things. So first can you tell me a little about what the company\u2019s been busy with?\n\nMagnus: Well, we\u2019ve created this wonderful product, the reMarkable paper tablet. We\u2019ve been very focused on that effort, based on a love for paper and a love for technology, to see if we can find some ways to join these two together to help people think better. That\u2019s sort of the the whole ethos of the company.\n\nSo for the last six years, we\u2019ve just been grinding away\u2026 you know, we\u2019re a small player up against the big guys on this. So we\u2019ve been sort of fighting guerrilla warfare trying to trying to establish ourselves.\n\nAnd we were successful, fortunately, when we did our pre-order campaign, because as we found out, we weren\u2019t the only ones who who love this notion of thinking better with the paper tablet, seeing paper as a powerful tool for thinking and for creating.", "description": "The reMarkable tablet is a strange device in this era of ultra-smart gadgets: A black and white screen meant for reading, writing, and sketching \u2014 and nothing more.
