Known as Takaya, he arrived seven years ago and has been alone ever since \u2014 unusual for an animal that typically lives in a family pack. His remarkable story is featured in Takaya: Lone Wolf, a documentary from The Nature of Things.\n\nIt\u2019s believed that Takaya left his pack as a juvenile, a behaviour that wolf experts call \u201cdispersal,\u201d possibly ready to strike out and create a family of his own. Whatever his motivation, he ended up in Victoria, and then swam one and a half kilometres, through some of the strongest currents along the coast, to reach the Discovery and Chatham Islands.\n\nTakaya has adapted to his marine environment over the years. But is he as lonely? And if so, will he ever find a mate with whom he can share his island home?\n\nA lonely howl\n\nTraditionally, lone wolves don\u2019t howl as much as pack wolves, tending to keep a lower profile. Takaya is an exception. His howls can be heard often during mating season \u2014 even in Victoria.\n\nCheryl Alexander, an environmentalist and conservation photographer appearing in the documentary, has followed Takaya and listened to his howls for years. \u201cThey are so impactful, emotionally. I\u2019d like to know if he is lonely. Does he really miss having his own kind around?\u201d she wonders.\n\n\u201cThe intriguing thing about this lone wolf is that \u2026 an act of natural dispersal has left it trapped by urbanization on an island of loneliness,\u201d says John Theberge, a wolf expert who taught at the University of Waterloo. \u201cThere, it gives voice, through its howls, to its deeply held emotions and social needs \u2014 all very similar to ours.\u201d\n\nA female wolf is spotted nearby\n\nAfter seven years, there may finally be an end to Takaya\u2019s isolation. Last winter, Alexander received an email that a wolf had been spotted sitting near rocks in front of somebody\u2019s mainland home. Her first thought was, \u201cTakaya has finally left the island!\u201d But photographs revealed that this was a new lone wolf \u2014 a female.\n\nSince then, Alexander has investigated multiple reports that there is a female wolf prowling near the point where Takaya is rumoured to have started his swim. \u201cThis whole process has been somewhat of a series of lucky coincidences with a sprinkle of fate,\u201d she says.\n\nIs it possible that this female lone wolf heard Takaya\u2019s call and is also seeking companionship? According to the documentary, wolf calls can be heard from several kilometres away. David Mech, a wolf expert and professor from the University of Minnesota adds that \u201cwolves have been known to travel far and wide, up to 500 to 600 miles [804 to 965 kilometres], to find a mate.\u201d\n\nHe also notes that female wolves around the age of two generally disperse from their pack to seek companionship during breeding season. In B.C., this would happen in mid- to late February and March, says Mech, which is around the time that the new female wolf was seen on the shoreline across from Takaya\u2019s home.\n\nMORE:\n\nVictoria photographer spends years documenting the life of a lone wolf off Vancouver Island\n\nTheberge thinks that it\u2019s possible the female heard Takaya and is following in his footsteps to find him. \u201cTakaya\u2019s lonely howls are most likely just a natural response to his internal hormones \u2026 and now they have reached out far enough to get a reply.\u201d\n\nAlexander doesn\u2019t believe the female wolf\u2019s presence is a coincidence either. \u201cI think, somehow, she was trying to find him,\u201d she says. \u201cThe chances of her coming to exactly this spot are really slim \u2026 without some kind of communication.\u201d\n\nHope for a companion still exists\n\nLast spotted in late summer 2019, the female lone wolf has since been keeping quiet and staying under the radar. \u201cIf the female wolf hasn\u2019t made an attempt to trek [to] Discovery Island, the chances are that she probably never will,\u201d says Mech.\n\nBut as long as the female is still in the area, Alexander has hope. \"The romantic part of me hopes this story for Takaya ends in a lovely female wolf making her way out to the islands and keeping him company and hunting with him throughout the last years of his life,\" she says. \"In the best of all possible worlds, they would produce a litter of pups and his strong lineage would carry on.\" She does, however, recognize that the addition of another wolf or pups would prove difficult given the limited territory that Takaya lives in. Should this happen though, she strongly believes that nature should be allowed to take its course without human interference.\n\nWith or without a female companion, however, Takaya seems to have found peace in being alone. \u201cI think we have a human need for companionship, but we also have a really strong sense of independence and need to be self-reliant. Watching this wolf has been very inspiring, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing to be comfortable alone,\u201d says Alexander.\n\nWatch Takaya: Lone Wolf on The Nature of Things", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/content/images/episodes/TakayaHowl_1920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
