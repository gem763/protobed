The company also has shut down social media accounts and stopped sales of flavored products to retail outlets in an effort to curb teen use.\n\nMore than 1,000 people have been sickened and at least 21 people have died in connection with vaping. Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) reported that a 17-year-old boy from the Bronx had died of a vaping-related illness, the youngest victim and the first teen.\n\nAD\n\nEven as investigators focus on black-market THC products as the root of the illnesses, many states have moved to curb all vaping, cautioning all users to quit or banning the sale of vaping products. Pediatricians warn that little is known about the long-term effects of vaping and report seeing alarming symptoms in young people who become addicted to nicotine.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, statistics show vaping rates have been rising among adolescents. About 1 in 9 high school seniors reported vaping nicotine on a near-daily basis, according to a government-funded survey, and a quarter reported vaping at least once in the last 30 days.\n\nThe four districts \u2014 Olathe Public Schools in Kansas, Three Village Central School District in New York, Francis Howell School District in Missouri and La Conner School District \u2014 contend that Juul purposefully marketed to teenagers and engineered products to make them popular among young people. The sleek devices emit a thin vapor and look like USB drives, making them difficult for adults to detect.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe lawsuits that we filed . . . were the first in what we fully anticipate will be many, many more to follow in the coming weeks and months as many school districts have decided to go on the offensive to combat the epidemic of youth vaping in the nation\u2019s schools,\u201d said Jonathan P. Kieffer of the Kansas City, Mo., law firm Wagstaff & Cartmell, which is representing three of the school systems. \u201cAmerica\u2019s schools are truly on the front lines of this epidemic, which has crossed all geographic and demographic lines and is increasing at an alarming rate in all regions of the country and impacting urban, suburban and rural schools.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchools have expended time and resources cracking down on students caught vaping. Some purchased pricey devices to detect vapor from e-cigarettes in school bathrooms. The fallout has also included expenses related to discipline, with student suspensions skyrocketing in some schools. In the Francis Howell School District, suspensions for nicotine infractions more than quadrupled over the past four years, with 248 students punished in the 2018-2019 school year, according to the lawsuit.\n\nSchool systems said the epidemic has sapped staff time. Some districts have hired additional staff to monitor bathrooms and tutors to help students who miss school for vaping-related infractions. Other districts are losing state funding because of the number of students they suspend for vaping.\n\nMagda Jean-Louis contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The four lawsuits filed recently are expected to be the first of many.", "authors": ["Moriah Balingit", "Reporter Covering National Education Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_glI5RjyCO4jpSBKQrg3lbaIA9I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F5LK55XKDUI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
