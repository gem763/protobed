The almighty hit seemed to inspire the underdogs who equaled the score with a penalty of their own shortly after.\n\nManu Tuilagi celebrates scoring his side's second try at the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\n\nErrors creeping in\n\nThe revival was short lived though, as England took control of the encounter when Manu Tuilagi powered over the line to score the game's first try.\n\nThe 28-year-old was in inspired form on Sunday and registered his second score of the match to put England in complete control by half-time.\n\nFarrell fired over another penalty shortly after the restart, before Jamie George and Luke-Cowan Dickie charged over the line to put the game to bed.\n\nDespite the bonus-point victory, England began to lack quality as the game wore on with a number of handling errors perhaps giving head coach Eddie Jones pause for thought.\n\n\"We'd like to be sharper with the ball and that will come. I was really pleased with the effort of my players, they worked really hard,\" said Jones after the match. \"What a great effort by Tonga. They fought really hard.\"\n\n\"We can be pleased about the end of the game when we were under the pump, we defended really well. That's two tests now we haven't conceded a try so we're pretty happy with that.\"\n\nIreland give Scotland cause for concern\n\nIn Yokohama, Ireland was in frightening form as it emphatically brushed aside Scotland in its World Cup opener.\n\nThe Irish flew out of the blocks and powered to a 12-0 lead in just 15 minutes and continued to turn the screw against its hapless opponent who struggled to get a foothold in the game.\n\nJames Ryan, Rory Best and Tadhg Furlong all ran over the line in the first half as Ireland won 27-3.\n\n\"When you don't play your best in your first game of a World Cup, then you will obviously be disappointed. We didn't show the best version of ourselves tonight,\" said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend after the defeat.\n\n\"We must play much better in our next three games if we are going to get out of our pool and progress into the quarterfinals and I believe we will be.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ireland captain Best said his teammates must continue improving if they want to go all the way in Japan.\n\n\"We started really well. We were positive, we wanted to attack. Obviously when the conditions [worsened] in the second half it became a bit more of an arm-wrestle,\" he said.\n\n\"We're under no illusions. That was a good start for us but we know, and the management will show us tomorrow, how much we need to improve going forward.\"\n\nPhotos: Rugby World Cup Italy's centre Tommaso Benvenuti fends off a tackle during the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Pool B match between Italy and Namibia.

There were a lot of mistakes from both sides,\" said Italy captain Sergio Parisse, who became just the third man to play in five Rugby World Cups.\n\n\"There was a lot of tension among the team. We have been preparing a long time for this game.\n\n\"The important thing was to win, to take the five points. Congratulations to Namibia as well because they never gave up, they played until the end, so congrats to both teams.\"", "description": "England began its 2019 Rugby World Cup campaign with a hard-fought win over Tonga to fire a warning to the tournament's other top teams.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190922120639-england-win-rugby-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
