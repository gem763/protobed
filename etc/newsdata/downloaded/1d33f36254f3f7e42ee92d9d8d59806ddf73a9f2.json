TSLA, -0.18% engaged in unfair labor practices in regards to its employees attempting to form a union, a judge ruled Friday in a National Labor Relations Board complaint. Administrative Law Judge Amita Baman Tracy found that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and other executives wrongly interrogated employees about organizing activity and told them that joining a union would be futile, sought to preclude union information or propaganda from being distributed or displayed, and wrongly terminated two employees who were involved in union-organizing activities. The judge also said that Musk's tweet suggesting that the organization of a union at the Fremont facility would lead to the loss of stock options for employees was a violation of labor law. \"Numerous supervisors and agents, including its chief executive officer and chief people officer, committed many violations of the Act,\" the judge wrote in his ruling. Tesla was ordered to rescind all the rules that were found to be in violation of the law and offer to rehire or compensate the two employees who were terminated. In addition, the judge ordered Musk personally to read a notice to employees aloud at the Fremont facility detailing what Tesla is allowed and not allowed to do in regards to the ruling.", "description": "Tesla Inc. engaged in unfair labor practices in regards to its employees attempting to form a union, a judge ruled Friday in a National Labor Relations Board...", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
