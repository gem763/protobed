The Post and The New York Times later reported that the incident in question involved Ukraine.\n\nFurther driving scrutiny about the complaint is the administration's decision to release military aid to Ukraine after a delay that had frustrated lawmakers in both parties.\n\nThe inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, declined to discuss the details of the whistleblower complaint with members of the House Intelligence Committee during a closed door meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe specifics of the complaint are mostly unknown. But Trump's handling of sensitive information has come under criticism in the past, and Democrats pushing for the president's impeachment are likely to seize on any indications that he pressed an ally to investigate an opponent or that he politicized intelligence information.\n\nTrump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke in July. A readout of the call from Ukraine published on July 25 said Trump was \u201cconvinced\u201d that the recently elected government would be able to \u201cquickly improve image of Ukraine,\u201d and \"complete [the] investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.\"\n\nA White House readout of the call said the two leaders discussed energy and economic cooperation, but made no mention of corruption.\n\n\"I really don't know,\" Trump said when asked Friday if the July 25 conversation was the subject of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nTrump earlier Friday had dismissed the whistleblower as \"highly partisan\" and insisted that the conversation in question was \"pitch perfect.\"\n\nThe president's allies have seized on Biden\u2019s connection to Ukraine in an attempt to paint the former vice president and front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination as corrupt.\n\n\n\nBiden\u2019s son Hunter worked with a natural gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. Biden pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been accused of overlooking corruption in his own office.\n\n\n\nWhile there\u2019s no indication Biden was acting with his son\u2019s interests in mind, Trump\u2019s allies, including attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiGiuliani clashes with CNN's Cuomo, calls him a 'sellout' and the 'enemy' Giuliani says 'of course' he asked Ukraine to look into Biden seconds after denying it George Conway: If Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate Biden, he 'should be impeached and removed from office' MORE, have claimed that the former vice president should be further investigated in Ukraine.", "description": "President Trump on Friday dismissed growing scrutiny over a whistleblower complaint that reportedly raised concerns about a conversation he had with a Ukrainian leader, saying the focus should instead be on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Bi", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpd_09202019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
