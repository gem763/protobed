The evidence gathered in the inquiry is coming out only piecemeal so far, but the president\u2019s loyalists in both the party and the media are resorting to increasingly desperate and far-fetched defenses, including risking arrest by physically occupying the room where the hearing is being held, and arguing that even if Trump sought a quid pro quo deal tying military aid to Ukraine to assistance with his reelection campaign, it shouldn\u2019t count because he was too incompetent to carry it out.\n\nAnd in what might be construed as a worrisome sign for the president, Sen. Lindsey Graham could muster only 44 colleagues in support of a resolution denouncing the way House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff is conducting the inquiry. There are 53 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nOn Wednesday, one day after the U.S.\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine, William B. Taylor, delivered damning and detailed closed-door testimony to three House committees investigating Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, more than two dozen of the president\u2019s staunchest supporters violated House rules and security protocol and stormed into the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, where three House committees were meeting to interview witnesses. At the heart of their protest, which delayed the scheduled testimony of Department of Defense official Laura Cooper by five hours, was the claim that Democrats were conducting the hearings in secret in an attempt to stage what Trump has often described as a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf behind those doors they intend to overturn the result of an American presidential election, we want to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., one of the leaders of the GOP brigade.\n\nIn fact, many Republicans \u2014including 13 of the the Freedom Caucus members who participated in the demonstration \u2014 are members of the committees and are free to attend the meetings, review documents and question witnesses.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who sits on the Oversight Committee, was one of those Republicans drawing attention to the secrecy of proceedings that he himself has been privy to.\n\n\u201cThe members have just had it, and they want to be able to see and represent their constituents and find out what\u2019s going on,\u201d Jordan said at the pre-planned press conference that preceded the storming of the SCIF.\n\nPhoto: Susan Walsh/AP More\n\nSo if Republicans have been in the room during every single deposition in the impeachment inquiry to date, why aren\u2019t the hearings public? Because Democrats don\u2019t want to give their witnesses the option to tailor their testimony ahead of time to match that of prior witnesses. Public hearings, while they make for entertaining workday distractions on cable news, also lend themselves to partisan grandstanding and displays of defiance, like the one former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski engaged in before the House Judiciary Committee on Sept. 17.\n\nIn 2016, then-Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., defended the closed-door format he decreed for the House investigation into the deaths of U.S. citizens in the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s preference for private interviews over public hearings has been questioned,\u201d Gowdy wrote in his committee\u2019s final report. \u201cInterviews are a more efficient and effective means of discovery. Interviews allow witnesses to be questioned in depth by a highly prepared member or staff person.\u201d\n\nGowdy\u2019s argument seems not to have registered with the Freedom Caucus or with the president himself, who, reportedly tipped off about the pizza party in the SCIF the day before it occurred, applauded his defenders Thursday for standing by him.", "description": "Donald Trump's defenders have attacked the process of the impeachment hearings as well as the president's own temperament when arguing he should not be removed rom office.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_EOvG2My8FLRnQ3EVlsm4A--~B/aD0yNjQzO3c9Mzk2NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/f8efdcd0-f759-11e9-bdfe-0c08f0ea3394", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
