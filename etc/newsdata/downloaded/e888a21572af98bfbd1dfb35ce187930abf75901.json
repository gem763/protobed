'Off-script' Trump rails against impeachment, Democrats at feisty rally MORE related to corruption in Ukraine. The whistleblower said administration officials were worried that Trump had used his office for personal gain on the call, and that they had sought to cover it up.\n\nYovanovitch expressed extreme surprise at her removal, saying that while she understood \u201cthat I served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nShe discussed what she described as \u201cattacks\u201d from former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiPompeo adviser resigning: report 'Off-script' Trump rails against impeachment, Democrats at feisty rally Trump's former Ukraine envoy was dismissed after she pushed Giuliani to go through official channels: report MORE, who is acting as Trump's personal attorney, in regards to her removal.\n\nShe said she had only met with Giuliani a handful of times, but suggested two associates of his who were arrested on campaign finance charges on Wednesday may have played a role in her ouster.\n\n\u201cWith respect to Mayor Giuliani, I have had only minimal contacts with him\u2014a total of three that I recall,\u201d Yovanovitch said. \u201cI do not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking me. But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe two men arrested at Dulles Airport on Wednesday are Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were reportedly helping Giuliani investigate Biden.\n\nYovanovitch blasted the efforts to promote what she described as \u201cbaseless conspiracy theories\u201d that she warned undermined U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good,\u201d Yovanovitch said.\n\n\u201cOur efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen. Sadly, someone was listening, and our nation is the worse off for that,\u201d Yovanovitch said.\n\nShe noted that her removal occurred during an \u201cespecially challenging time in bilateral relations,\u201d and when the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine most needed \u201ccontinuity\" due to the election of a new Ukrainian president.\n\nYovanovitch also focused her opening statement on expressing serious concerns around the Trump administration\u2019s support of the State Department, saying that the \u201cbasic understanding\u201d that the government will protect diplomats \u201cno longer holds true.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,\u201d Yovanovitch testified. \u201cState Department leadership, with Congress, needs to take action now to defend this great institution, and its thousands of loyal and effective employees.\n\n\"We need to rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance America\u2019s interests and the front line of America\u2019s defense. I fear that not doing so will harm our nation\u2019s interest, perhaps irreparably.\"\n\nDespite her criticism of the Trump administration, Yovanovitch emphasized that the idea she was \u201cdisloyal\u201d to Trump was \u201cfictitious,\u201d pushing back against allegations that she told embassy staff to ignore Trump\u2019s orders due to the likelihood that he would be impeached.\n\nThe intelligence community whistleblower complaint alleged that the then-prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko accused Yovanovitch of giving him a \"do not prosecute\" list. Lutsenko later retracted his remarks.\n\nYovanovitch denied the allegations in her prepared remarks, stating that \"I have never myself or through others, directly or indirectly, ever directed, suggested, or in any other way asked for any government or government official in Ukraine (or elsewhere) to refrain from investigating or prosecuting actual corruption.\"\n\nYovanovitch appeared for testimony on Capitol Hill despite the White House announcing earlier this week that the Trump administration would not comply with the House impeachment inquiry, citing the lack of a formal vote to authorize the investigation.", "description": "The former U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/yovanovitchmarie_101119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
