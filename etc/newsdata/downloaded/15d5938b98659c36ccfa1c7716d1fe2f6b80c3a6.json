Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/gas 4.\n\n2. Place the whole garlic bulb in the oven for 1 hour, or until softened.\n\n3. To make the pineapple salsa, trim and peel the pineapple, cutting out any brown scraggy bits. Slice into wedges, cutting out and discarding the tough core.\n\n4. Dry fry in a large frying pan over a medium heat for around 4 minutes, or until charred, turning occasionally. Finely chop, then place into a bowl with all the lovely juices.\n\n5. Finely chop the chilies, pick and finely chop the mint leaves, then peel and finely chop the onion. Squeeze in the lime juice and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Season to taste.\n\n6. For the guacamole, peel and roughly chop the red onion, trim and roughly chop the spring onions and roughly chop the chilies on a large chopping board. Destone the avocados and scoop the flesh onto the board, then halve and deseed the tomatoes.\n\n7. Start chopping and mixing all the ingredients together until finely chopped and combined.\n\n8. Pick over the mint leaves, squeeze over the lime juice and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. Season to taste with sea salt and black pepper, giving it one final chop.\n\n9. Very finely slice the red cabbage on a mandolin (use the guard!). Finely slice the jalape\u00f1o chili, then place in a bowl with the vinegar. Mix well.\n\n10. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins, then mash and fold it through the sour cream (use natural yogurt if you want to be a little healthier). Add the lime juice and a splash of extra virgin olive oil, then season to taste. Pick, finely chop and stir through the parsley leaves.\n\n11. Drain and add the cannellini beans to a medium frying pan over a medium-high heat. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they start to pop and blister. Place in a bowl and keep warm. Wrap and warm your tortillas in the cooling oven.\n\n12. Wipe the pan out and return to a medium heat with a splash of olive oil. Season the haddock fillets and finely grate over the lemon zest, then place skin-side down in the pan for 4 minutes, pressing down lightly with a fish slice. Turn them over and cook for a further 3 minutes, or until slightly golden and just cooked.\n\n13. Place your warm tortillas on a plate and top with a spoonful of guacamole and slaw. Flake over the fish in chunky pieces, then top with the pineapple salsa, a dollop of garlicky sour cream and a spoonful of crispy beans.\n\n14. Pick, finely slice and scatter over the mint leaves, then serve with sliced red chili and lime wedges, if you like.\n\nYield: Makes 4 servings\n\nThis recipe originally appeared on Jamie & Jimmy\u2019s Food Fight Club - Series 4: \u00a9 2015 Jamie Oliver.
