Kroger had nearly 500,000 full-time and part-time employees across its stores as of fiscal 2018.\n\nThe layoffs came as the company invests in its online business and delivery service amid tough competition from Walmart, Albertsons and other rivals as part of its \u201cRestock Kroger\u201d initiative. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen told analysts last month that the company was not \u201creconfirming\u201d its three-year projection of $400 million in incremental operating profit tied to the measures.\n\nThe profit warning sent shares tumbling even as Kroger reported quarterly profit that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nKroger also owns and operates Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer and several other chains. The company\u2019s stock fell roughly two percent in trading Wednesday and is down about nine percent so far this year.\n\nBusiness Insider was first to report the Kroger layoffs.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "Kroger had nearly 500,000 full-time and part-time employees across its stores as of fiscal 2018.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}
