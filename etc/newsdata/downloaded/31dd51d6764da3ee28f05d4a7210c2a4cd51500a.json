As California experiences intensifying weather extremes and confronts the sharpening consequences of a changing climate, the power company responsible for starting the deadliest wildfire in state history has undertaken the most extensive planned power outage ever employed.\n\nFavorable weather in Northern California pushed off a second phase of power outages that had been planned for midday. The stiff, dry winds \u2014 known here as Diablos \u2014 did not whip up as early as had been forecast, though predictions still called for them to strengthen into the evening. As many as a million households \u2014 with more than 2 million people \u2014 could eventually be affected by the outage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, all political,\u201d said Gregg Bowman, a 63-year-old architect, as he shopped in Home Depot here in the minutes before the planned noon shut-off. \u201cThis company is so screwed up.\u201d\n\nBowman lives in Calistoga, a quaint resort town in the Sierra foothills, where the Tubbs Fire ravaged tinder-dry wine country two years ago. His power was cut intentionally two weeks ago amid moderate winds and, after he exhausted his gasoline supplies, he lost electricity again just after midnight on Wednesday.\n\nClutching two plastic jugs, the last two in the huge store, Bowman said the weather in Calistoga did not support the shutdown, which he has been told could last five days. One of the jugs was for diesel, even though his generator runs on gasoline.\n\n\u201cI just took what I could,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this will only hold enough gas to run my refrigerator for about eight hours \u2014 that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nThe shut-off could eventually encompass more than half the state\u2019s 58 counties, much of them in Northern California, where two of the deadliest fires in state history have occurred in the past two years. Heavy winter rains followed by extreme dryness and summer heat have created dangerous amounts of natural fuel across the region, increasing the threat that power lines pose. Winds can bring down lines, sparking wildfires, with strong gusts driving the flames quickly out of control and making them almost impossible to contain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe crisis economy that emerged Wednesday in stores such as Home Depot belied the larger losses that would result from days without electricity as vintners, ranchers and farmers, small restaurants and corner groceries face millions of dollars in lost business.\n\n\u201cWe believe this reflects a stark new reality for California as the state grapples with the impacts of more extreme weather \u2014 wildfire, flooding, drought and storms \u2014 resulting from climate change,\u201d said Rufus Jeffris, a vice president at the Bay Area Council, a prominent business group.\n\nPG&E was found responsible for igniting one of those two disastrous recent fires, the blaze that tore through Paradise last year, killing 85 people and turning 14,000 homes to ash. The company has since filed for bankruptcy in the face of billions of dollars in liability claims.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was among the last of the state\u2019s utilities to employ \u201cpublic safety power shut-offs,\u201d as the planned outages are known. Power companies here have the right to shut off electricity when wind, temperatures and humidity align to create high-risk fire conditions. Such decisions are reviewed by the state Public Utilities Commission.\n\n\u201cWe know how much our customers rely on electric service and the impacts these events can have on them, their families, businesses, and communities \u2014 including the use of medical equipment and refrigeration,\u201d PG&E wrote in a report to the commission last month on its use of power shut-offs. \u201cWe will only consider proactively turning off power when the benefits of de-energization outweigh potential public safety risks.\u201d\n\nBut there also is an element of political negotiation in the shut-off, which in this case was explained by PG&E as the result of predicted high winds that have been the driving force behind the state\u2019s worst fires.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nForecasts Wednesday called for gusts as high as 55 mph, which puzzled many here during a cool, clear afternoon when the palms and eucalyptus remained still and flags lay limp on their poles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m outraged because it didn\u2019t have to happen,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said Wednesday during a news conference in San Diego. \u201cThey\u2019re in bankruptcy due to their terrible management going back decades. They\u2019ve created these conditions; it was unnecessary.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, PG&E has sought to loosen California\u2019s liability standards, which hold utilities responsible for any damage that results from fires the company\u2019s equipment start, regardless of whether the company is found negligent. The principle, known as \u201cinverse condemnation,\u201d is among the strictest in the nation.\n\nAD\n\nDespite heavy lobbying by utilities, California lawmakers had refused to change that standard in recent legislative sessions. But this year lawmakers loosened it slightly to allow a lower liability threshold for utilities that first complete billions of dollars in safety improvements to power lines, transformers and other equipment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen the power goes out, it\u2019s fun to sit around and fantasize about the many ways you will oppose any legislation or initiatives that are favorable towards\u201d PG&E, tweeted John Holland, a Berkeley resident and partner in a technology services company, whose telecommuting employees cannot work when electricity is shut off.\n\nPG&E has 16 million customers, the majority of them in Northern California. The company has begun a campaign of television advertising concerning fire safety. The spots include animated illustrations of how to create \u201cdefensible spaces\u201d around homes, jargon that has crept into California\u2019s daily conversation.\n\nAcross the state, neighborhoods organize meetings to gather information about which residents would need extra help during intentional power shut-offs, who has generators, and whose medical issues would be exacerbated in a blackout.\n\nUtilities try to give a 48-hour warning before a planned power outage, allowing customers some time to prepare for what could be a long time without electricity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe extent of this outage, the utility has warned, could mean that it will take days to restore power service across the affected area once the winds have calmed and temperatures cool. Hundreds of miles of power lines must be checked, with transformers and other equipment tested, before turning the power back on, lest downed wires and damaged equipment cause the fires the company has sought to avoid.\n\nEven short-lived outages have proved onerous \u2014 and expensive \u2014 for state residents. In rural California, recent power shut-offs have led to a lack of refrigeration and the spoilage of butchered meat and harvested grapes and avocados.\n\nEmergency generators are costly to buy and to run, with the price of gasoline exceeding $4 per gallon. Generators also pose a fire risk of their own.\n\nHere in Oakland, a city where the hills burned in 1991, killing 25 people and destroying more than 2,800 homes, Wednesday was cool, dry and windless. People waited \u2014 and waited \u2014 for the announced shut-off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPhones buzzed with updates, missed deadlines. Employees planned evening commutes around the possibility of dark traffic signals and gridlock.\n\nSome spent much of the day in quiet anxiety, the dire weather predictions reminding them of the grim fall weeks that befell California during the Camp and Tubbs fires.\n\nTina Hubbard lives in the no-stoplight town of Grizzly Flats, tucked in the Sierra and cut by canyons. Bears, mountain lion and deer are common pedestrians downtown, and when the winds rise over the ridges, PG&E often cuts the power.\n\nShe works with a group of clinics, helping them with digital medical records. When the power disappears, as it did Wednesday, so does her ability to work. \u201cI live on my computer,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nHubbard skipped grocery shopping this week, predicting that her fridge would not be working for days. \u201cSingle-serving soup, nothing perishable, that\u2019s how we\u2019re doing it now,\u201d she said, grateful for her propane stove.\n\nAD\n\nShe lives with her husband, a mail carrier, and the couple\u2019s generator is hooked up to power the kitchen and the master bedroom only. But it is still used sparingly. \u201cGas prices with a gas generator?\u201d she said. \u201cIt gets really expensive really quickly.\u201d\n\nIt will be days before her power returns, even though the wind in El Dorado County remained so still that Hubbard said \u201cit doesn\u2019t even move my hair.\u201d The power lines to Grizzly Flats are long, run up hills and through canyons, and will take time to inspect before carrying a current again.", "description": "More than half a million customers were without power on Wednesday, and more outages could come as the state\u2019s weather extremes \u2014 wind and dryness \u2014 again threaten blazes.", "authors": ["Scott Wilson", "Senior National Correspondent Focusing On California", "The West"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tfB11fgLVP0610dxzMnm4toEhzY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNGBJNHKXMI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
