To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,\" the prince said in the statement posted on the royal couple's website.\n\n\"There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face - as so many of you can relate to - I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,\" Harry said.\n\nA Mail on Sunday spokesman told Britain's Press Association the paper \"stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.\n\n\"Specifically, we categorically deny that the duchess' letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning,\" the spokesman said.\n\nIn Tuesday's statement, Harry mentioned his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in an August 1997 car crash while being pursued by paparazzi, as the reason he knew the move to take a tabloid to court \"may not be the safe one, it is the right one.\n\n\"Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" he said. \"I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\"\n\nThe royal couple is paying for the lawsuit with private and not public funds, the Press Association reported.\n\nThe news agency said if damages are awarded to Markle, they will be donated to a charity that combats bullying.\n\nThe royal couple has been touring Southern Africa with their baby son, Archie.", "description": "Lawsuit accuses the Mail on Sunday of 'intrusive' publication of a letter the Duchess of Sussex wrote to her father.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/aef1fb80ce0d4a4fa306ea59939105a5_18.jpg"}
