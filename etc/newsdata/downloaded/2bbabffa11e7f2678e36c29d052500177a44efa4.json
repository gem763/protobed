Many cybercriminal underground forums already have sections dedicated to gaming or esports sales. The market for stolen gaming accounts and hacks are flooded, much like the market for stolen credit card accounts,\" the report said.\n\n\"When something gets enormous \u2013 huge \u2013 there will be always individuals and groups who will want to abuse it. The gaming and esports enterprises are the same,\" said Bharat Mistry, principal security strategist at Trend Micro.\n\n\"With millions of dollars available it is bound to pull in cybercriminals or digital hoodlums whose main game is abusing vulnerabilities with the goal of illicit financial gain\"\n\nDDoS attacks are the simplest malicious campaigns which could impact esports tournaments, with the potential for traffic being directed at servers where online matches are hosted. Not only could slowing online connections cause disruption in games where milliseconds can determine outcomes, there's also the potential for entire tournaments being taken offline.\n\nResearchers also warn that attackers could blackmail tournament organisers, demanding payment in exchange for not launching a DDoS attack \u2013 something which organisers might consider given how events are broadcast live and the reputational damage that will occur to the host organiser if the event gets taken offline.\n\nSEE: A winning strategy for cybersecurity (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)\n\nAnother attack vector which hackers could take advantage of is vulnerable game servers: researchers scanned esports related servers using Shodan and found 219, 981 were accessible.\n\nWhile online game servers are internet facing by their very nature, the way that they're accessible via Shodan makes it simple for cyber criminals to locate the servers and potentially identify unpatched vulnerabilities.\n\nUnpatched servers could provide cyber criminals with access which they could use to conduct sabotage, inject scripts or even use to steal login credentials which could potentially be used as a gateway to gain access to game company servers, or even the accounts of for high level professional players.\n\nResearchers also warn that it's possible that famous gamers could also be targeted in the same way via the use of spear-phishing attacks.\n\nThe good news is that video game companies and tournament organisers are mostly aware of the threats esports faces from cyber criminals. But that doesn't mean the industry can rest on its laurels because as the sector becomes bigger and more lucrative, attackers will put in extra effort into attempting to compromise it.\n\nFor now, researchers recommend that in order to stay protected against cyber attacks, companies in the eSports industry apply patches to secure systems against known vulnerabilities and employ layered defences to help protect servers.\n\nREAD MORE ON CYBER SECURITY", "description": "Researchers at Trend Micro detail the ways in which the multi-billion dollar competitive online gaming industry could be vulnerable to malicious campaigns including DDoS attacks, malware and extortion.", "authors": ["Danny Palmer"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/09/8c4c16ad-42dc-4a9f-995c-dae2c075f512/thumbnail/770x578/9cf053cb8fc5dd9f05ca56c36cb71101/fortnite-gamer-11333328.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
