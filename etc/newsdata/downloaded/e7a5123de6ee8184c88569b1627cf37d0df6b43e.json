I don\u2019t mind having your bum as my view for the rest of this train ride. By all means, have a seat on the table.\u2019\n\nPaul bemoaned having the man\u2019s bum as his view for the rest of the journey (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\nPaul, with wife Trish, said it was \u2018particularly egregious\u2019 in light of the empty seats scattered around (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\nPaul, from Tadworth in Surrey, said it took the man \u2018four seconds tops\u2019 to beeline for his table after getting on the 30-minute service to London Bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe operations manager said: \u2018I thought it was both crass and a bit inconsiderate.\n\n\u2018I thought it was very egocentric and very self-centered on his part, particularly when as he sat down the thing visibly bent.\n\n\u2018Not only was he doing this rather rudely and inconsiderately but he was potentially causing damage to the table.\n\n\u2018He had to have been able to tell that it was giving way under his weight, and it made snapping and popping noises.\n\n\u2018If we hit a bump or went around a corner pretty hard you could hear it groaning and making those noises.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not uncommon for someone to get on and as the train starts to crowd up just plop down and use that table right in front of people as a seat.\n\n\u2018This particular one I thought was particularly egregious because there were empty seats on the train.\n\n\u2018He paid no attention to the fact that there was somebody at the table, that there was somebody who had something on the table, or that the table \u2013 meant for laptops or books \u2013 creaked and made cracking noises under his weight.\u2019\n\nThe Southern journey regularly fills up and there aren\u2019t many handrails to cling onto, Paul said (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nPaul put the stunt down to \u2018habit\u2019 as the man was probably used to the train being full by that stage of the journey and there aren\u2019t very many handrails to cling onto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a large space \u2013 there\u2019s no place to [use] a handrail,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018Somebody sees a place to park their backside for the next 40 minutes and rather than stand or show consideration to others, they take a load off.\n\n\u2018I admit I didn\u2019t say anything to him, I just sat there and fumed and took a picture of his backside on the table.\u2019\n\nHis social media post garnered more than 200 comments, with Gordon Hodge observing: \u2018Tables are made for glasses and not for stinking arses.\u2019\n\nAnother, Charlotte Dales, said: \u2018This would annoy me so much. Such an invasion of personal space!\u2019\n\nDan Dodd simply remarked: \u2018What an arsehole.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
