Kamala Harris both achieved 6 percent in the poll, while Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke raked in 3 percent of respondents.\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang pulled in 2 percent support, and all other candidates polled at 1 percent or less.\n\nBiden\u2019s standing in Wednesday\u2019s survey marks his most significant edge in CNN\u2019s primary polling since he announced his campaign in late April and dominated the Democratic field with 39 percent support.\n\nHis advantage in the latest CNN poll, conducted in the days following the fourth Democratic debate last week, also comes despite a plurality of respondents judging that Warren outperformed Biden during the televised forum.\n\nAmong those who watched or paid close attention to news coverage of the Ohio debate, 28 percent said Warren \u201cdid the best job,\u201d and only 15 percent said Biden\u2019s showing was superior.\n\nWhite House allies and Republican lawmakers over the past month have targeted Biden relentlessly with unfounded allegations that he led the Obama administration's efforts to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to protect his son's business interests in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, other recent polls have shown Warren overtaking Biden in the Democratic nominating contest, and candidates such as Buttigieg and Klobuchar have sought to make a more forceful case for themselves to the center-left voters largely backing Biden.\n\nBiden also failed to eclipse a handful of his opponents in fundraising for the third quarter of this year, amassing just $15.2 million in the three months ending in September. Sanders raised $25 million, Warren raised $24.6 million and Buttigieg raised $19.1 million during that same period.\n\nBesides Biden, the poll\u2019s other obvious beneficiaries are Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke, who have both moved closer to appearing on stage for the fifth party-sanctioned primary debate next month.\n\nTo participate in that forum, candidates must achieve at least 3 percent support in four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee and pick up contributions from 165,000 donors by Nov. 13.\n\nThe survey is Klobuchar\u2019s third qualifying poll and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s second. Eight candidates have already met the threshold for the Atlanta-area debate on Nov. 20.\n\nThe CNN poll was conducted Oct. 17-20, surveying a random national sample of 1,003 adults including 424 registered voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents.\n\nThe margins of sampling error are plus or minus 3.7 percentage points for the full sample and 5.8 percentage points for results among potential Democratic voters.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8f/41/eaa45a8e4aa7819748b65d8ce6ca/191012-joe-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
