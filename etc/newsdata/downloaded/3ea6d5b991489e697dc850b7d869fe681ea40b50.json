It\u2019s almost as fast to mix your own from scratch! It's healthier, cheaper and the kids will love it too!\n\nJump to my recipe for Lemon Ricotta Pancakes With Smashed Blackberries\n\nMake a Healthier, Cheaper Pancake Mix\n\nMix up your own pancake mix to keep in the cupboard:\n\nStir your choice of flours and grains together at a ratio of 1 cup flour to 1 tsp. baking powder with a pinch of salt.\n\nAdd 1 tbsp. sugar if you want them on the sweet side (the added sugar will also help the pancakes brown in the pan).\n\nI like to use regular and whole wheat flour combined with barley flour, which has about four times as much fibre as whole wheat flour, plus some oat flour \u2014 the grainy flours lend a nuttiness that works well in a pancake, while boosting nutrients and fibre.\n\nUse your homemade mix:\n\nWhisk one cup of milk, an egg and a tablespoon of oil into each cup of mix. (One, one, one and one. Easy, right?)\n\nDon\u2019t overmix your batter \u2014 a few lumps will work themselves out in the pan.\n\nSimply double or triple if you\u2019re feeding a crowd.\n\nGolden Pancakes, Every Time\n\nCast iron skillets are ideal for pancakes \u2014 they retain an even heat and provide a non-stick surface without an artificial coating:\n\nHeat your skillet over medium-high heat, add a drizzle of oil and wipe it around the pan with a paper towel.\n\nPour about 1/3 cup of batter into the pan using a ladle or measuring cup.\n\nIf you want to add berries, place them on the batter right in the pan, which will guarantee they\u2019re evenly distributed and keep batter from turning blue-green. Banana slices work well here, too.\n\nWait until bubbles begin to break on the surface of the pancake and the edge turns from shiny to matte \u2014 then it\u2019s time to flip, using a thin spatula. Don\u2019t wait for the surface of the pancake to be covered with bubbles that have broken.\n\nBy now, the bottom of the pancake should be nicely golden. Cook for another minute on the other side and serve right away.\n\nYou can also keep pancakes warm until everyone is ready to eat. Slide pancakes onto a plate or wire rack on a baking sheet and keep warm in a 200\u02daF.\n\nMaple Syrup Secret\n\nAs you wait for your pancakes to cook, warm maple syrup in a small saucepan so the fridge-cold syrup doesn\u2019t cool down your pancakes. You can also add a handful of berries to the maple syrup. They\u2019ll release their juices into the syrup as they warm through.\n\nFor a special treat, lemon zest and juice and ricotta cheese make for ethereal pancakes, especially when topped with ripe blackberries. These are a great way to use up some ricotta\u2014or even cottage cheese\u2014that\u2019s leftover in your fridge and a beautiful way to make use of an enthusiastic blackberry crop.\n\nYou Will Need:\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n2 tbsp. sugar\n\n2 tsp. baking powder\n\npinch salt\n\n1 cup ricotta cheese\n\n2 large eggs\n\n3/4 cup milk\n\ngrated zest and juice of a lemon (or half a lemon)\n\ncanola oil and butter\n\n1/2-1 pint fresh blackberries or raspberries\n\n1/4 cup sugar\n\nmaple syrup (optional)\n\nDirections:\n\nIn a large bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together ricotta, eggs, milk, lemon juice and zest. Add to the flour mixture and stir just until combined. Preheat a heavy skillet (cast iron is ideal) or griddle and brush with oil and/or butter. Turn heat down to medium-low and ladle on some pancake batter (about 1/3 cup). Cook until golden on the bottom and bubbly on the top, with some bubbles breaking through. Flip with a thin spatula and cook until golden on the other side. Serve immediately or keep warm in a 200\u02daF oven. Meanwhile, roughly mash berries with 1/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. As soon as the sugar dissolves, it\u2019s ready to serve. If you want a runnier sauce, add pure maple syrup for a pourable blackberry sauce.\n\nServes 4-6.", "description": "Step-by-step instructions on how to make a great pancake and an easy recipe for homemade pancake mix.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/parents/content/imgs/_8col/pancakes_lead_jvanrosendaal.jpg", "published_at": "2015-07-09"}
