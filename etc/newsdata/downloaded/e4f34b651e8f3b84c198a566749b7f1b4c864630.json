For the report\u2019s sixth edition, Morningstar is publishing each of the four evaluation categories \u2013 fees and expenses, regulation and taxation, disclosures, and sales \u2013 as independent chapters.\n\nThe most investor-friendly markets with the lowest costs incurred were Australia, the Netherlands and the United States, which earned \u201ctop\u201d grades.\n\nThe US has received the highest grade in all six editions of the study, underpinned by the positive effects of economies of scale and competition, Morningstar said.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia and the Netherlands both maintained their grade for the third consecutive study, as effective regulation has led to high fee transparency in both markets, while competition and economies of scale also conferred savings in Australia.\n\nOn the other hand, Taiwan and Italy were the worst performers, receiving \u201cbottom\u201d grades.\n\n\u201cTaiwan is a perennial poor performer, with some of the costliest funds among markets covered in the study,\u201d Morningstar noted.\n\nItaly fell from a \u201cbelow average\u201d grade to a \u201cbottom\u201d grade, as its funds subjected individual investors to front loads and retrocessions. Italian funds also suffered from high asset-weighted median expenses across the board.\n\nBased on Morningstar\u2019s analysis, investor experience is improving across multiple economies, given the lower fees and ease of entry for investors to buy funds without loads or trailing commissions.\n\nFund fees have continued to decline across global markets, since the last study two years ago. Asset-weighted median expense ratios for domestic and available-for-sale funds fell in a majority of the 26 markets surveyed since the 2017 study. The Netherlands saw the biggest drop in fees, followed by India and Canada.\n\n\u201cThis (overall decline in fund fees) reflects a number of key trends including orderly competition, regulatory intervention, and changing practices that have led to the unbundling of advice and sales fees from fund expense ratios in some markets,\u201d said Grant Kennaway, Morningstar\u2019s global practice leader of manager research and co-author of the study.\n\nMany regulators are stepping up to promote fee transparency, as government policies in those markets have facilitated increased savings through tax incentives, compulsion, or both, Morningstar noted.\n\nConsiderable growth of the investment industry, boosted by rising markets and increased savings, has also highlighted the need to share the benefits of economies of scale with investors.\n\nFor example, India improved to an \u201caverage\u201d grade for fees and expenses, up from \u201cbelow average\u201d in 2017. India had been among the most expensive geographies when it came to expense ratios, but investor-friendly regulations banning front loads and upfront commissions, and more recently, capping investment charges, have contributed to its improved grade.\n\nThe GIE study aims to empower investors worldwide by promoting dialogue and transparency around global best practices for mutual funds from the perspective of fund shareholders.\n\nThe study primarily considered publicly available open-end funds, or retail registered investment pools that are not listed on an exchange. It uses asset-weighted expense ratios as the best objective measure to compare fund costs globally. The study included a limited number of questions on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), to assess the breadth and level of ETF use in each market.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - INVESTORS of mutual funds in Singapore pay higher fees than those in other markets, because the majority of funds in the city-state charge front loads and trail commission, according to a study by Morningstar. .
