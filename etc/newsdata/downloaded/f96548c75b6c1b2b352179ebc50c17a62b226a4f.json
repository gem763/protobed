Only an exhibitionist would write about a book that won\u2019t be released for another month. Reader, I am that writer.\n\nThe book is A Warning, a 272-pager set for publication Nov. 19 and written by \u201cAnonymous,\u201d the unnamed senior Trump official who wrote an unsigned September 2018 column for the New York Times titled \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\u201d Other observers who have yet to read A Warning\u2014including White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, Matthew Miller, former Trump aide Cliff Sims, Tom Nichols and Mimi Rocah\u2014quickly registered their negative opinions the book. Some of them called Anonymous a coward for concealing his identity and pledged not to buy or read A Warning until he applies his name to it.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut if Anonymous is a coward for wearing a mask while spilling beans about the Trump White House, he has plenty of company. Unnamed sources routinely whisper their secrets into the pages of the nation\u2019s top newspapers. Among these anonymous sources are allies of the president, seeking to promote his policies, as well as opponents hoping to take him down a notch. I\u2019m no booster of anonymous sources, but even I recognize the distinguished, ancient pedigree they hold in American politics. Thomas Paine wrote Common Sense anonymously. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay cloaked their authorship of The Federalist Papers under the pseudonym of \u201cPublius.\u201d In more recent days, journalist Joe Klein joined the lower levels of this pantheon with Primary Colors, his roman \u00e0 clef about Bill Clinton.\n\nMore important, time has been remarkably good to Anonymous\u2019 op-ed. When first published, it seemed vague, unnecessarily guarded and excessively self-congratulatory about its own courage. But read in the context of what we\u2019ve learned since about resistance by senior officials to President Donald Trump\u2019s orders, the op-ed seems a lot smarter. The op-ed boasted that the Trump administration was filled with many senior administration officials \u201cworking diligently from within to frustrate\u201d parts of Trump\u2019s \u201cagenda and his worst inclinations.\u201d A steady stream of news stories has appeared\u2014and continues to appear almost daily\u2014confirming the assertion of aggressive sandbagging of the president by top administration officials.\n\nThe Mueller report documents how former White House counsel Don McGahn directly foiled Trump\u2019s order to fire the special counsel, as NBC News noted on Tuesday. Since leaving office, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has described how he rejected Trump orders that he thought violated the law. Bob Woodward\u2019s book Fear: Trump in the White House reported how economic adviser Gary Cohn nicked a Sept. 5, 2017, trade-deal document from the president\u2019s desk to prevent him from signing it. \u201cI stole it off his desk,\u201d Cohn told an associate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let him see it. He\u2019s never going to see that document. Got to protect the country.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s now evident that the stop-Trump rebellion stretched across the Potomac to the Pentagon. According to a forthcoming memoir by a speechwriter for Jim Mattis, the former secretary of Defense, repeatedly dragged his feet in response to Trump\u2019s orders and alerted his aides to what he regarded as Trump\u2019s treachery. \u201cThe White House is not to be trusted right now,\u201d Mattis reportedly said in March 2018 to his close aides as Trump pushed Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Cohn from the White House and out of the administration. Mattis also roadblocked Trump\u2019s desire for a Soviet-style military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and stalled Trump\u2019s plans to withdraw troops from Syria until he could stall no longer and finally resigned.\n\nThe boldest claim made by the op-ed was \u201cearly whispers with the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment\u201d to remove the president. Oh, sure, I thought at the time. But two weeks after the op-ed appeared, the New York Times broke a story that essentially confirmed the formation of a 25th Amendment posse led by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and designed to push Trump from office. There\u2019s been more reporting on that allegation since, including a new book by journalist James B. Stewart asserting that Rosenstein believed two members of the president\u2019s 2017 Cabinet\u2014Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly\u2014were ready to join his 25th Amendment plot.\n\nThis steady confirmation of the op-ed\u2019s key points by the best journalists covering the Trump administration makes it easy to award A Warning a four-star, prepublication review and predict that it will serve as a revelatory text. The impeachment committees should preorder their copies now.\n\n******\n\nAnonymous won\u2019t be anonymous much longer thanks to forensic author-identification software.
