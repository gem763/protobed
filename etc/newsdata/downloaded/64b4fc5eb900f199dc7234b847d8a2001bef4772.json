Not only are more new films being released than ever before, but streaming means we can choose from thousands of movies without even leaving our sofa. You could watch something different every night and still barely make a dent in the sheer volume of entertainment on offer. So why do so many of us choose to watch films we\u2019ve already seen \u2013 once, twice or a dozen times before? When Back To The Future appears in the TV schedule, why do we sit through it for the 43rd time, already knowing every line of the script?\n\nMore like this:\n\n- What the Joker says about his times\n\n- Why do gay men love Judy Garland?\n\n- The year\u2019s most devastating film\n\nNetflix uploaded 8500 minutes\u2019 worth of their own original movies last year, but it was a recent announcement that Dirty Dancing was coming to the streaming platform that caused hysteria on Twitter. When Avengers: Endgame was released this year, one fan made it in to the record books for watching it more than 103 times \u2013 but was soon beaten by someone who made 116 cinema trips to see it.\n\nWhile 100-plus viewings within a few weeks is extreme, a quick canvass of friends revealed rewatching films we\u2019ve already seen countless times is common. Some titles were mentioned repeatedly \u2013 the aforementioned Back To The Future and Dirty Dancing, along with other 1980s classics like Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, Top Gun, Jaws and The Princess Bride. Musicals \u2013 including Grease, Singin\u2019 In The Rain, Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music \u2013 were also popular, as were Bond films, The Godfather, the original Star Wars trilogy and Lord of The Rings. And, aptly, Groundhog Day. Other choices were more individual \u2013 Arrival, What Lies Beneath, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Burbs, An American Werewolf in Paris. One brave soul likes to rewatch The Exorcist regularly.\n\nIn 2016, data website FiveThirtyEight surveyed 1169 people to come up with a list of the 25 most-rewatched films \u2013 with Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music taking the top spots. My own personal rewatchables include When Harry Met Sally, Lost In Translation, Almost Famous and most \u201990s rom-coms (I not only know every line of Pretty Woman\u2019s dialogue, but the words to every song on the soundtrack, too).\n\nQuality assurance\n\nPinpointing which films we watch again and again is easy. Exactly why we do it is less clear. Of course, there\u2019s the obvious \u2013 we love them and think they deserve more of our attention. When BBC Culture asked its Film Club on Facebook for their picks, one response was Back to the Future, because \u201cit\u2019s a nigh-on perfect film with an inch-perfect script, great performances and some great direction. Not a wasted scene in sight.\u201d Casablanca, 8 1/2, The Last Emperor and Withnail & I (\u201cthe best film ever made about friendship\u201d) also got a nod \u2013 films that regularly appear in Greatest Ever film polls. One user said: \u201cSome films are what I\u2019d call \u2018complete\u2019 \u2013 they have a perfect story arc, the score is almost a member of the cast, and are so familiar you can stop and start at any point. They are deeply satisfying and you can lose yourself in them, the cinema equivalent of comfort food. So for me, that\u2019s classics like A Night To Remember and Sink The Bismarck.\u201d It makes sense we\u2019d want to revisit them and pick up nuances we might have missed the first time around.\n\nBut while that might explain the second, third, or fourth viewing, what keeps us coming back to a movie when we already know every plot twist and detail, and there are so many other films vying for our time? After all, this isn\u2019t like listening to a favourite song on repeat \u2013 we\u2019re talking two hours, not three minutes.\n\nOne explanation is that watching something we\u2019re already familiar with takes up less mental energy. We don\u2019t have to concentrate to work out what\u2019s going on because we already know. We can just sit back and, kind of, switch off. It\u2019s \u201cless taxing, more relaxing\u201d as one friend put it. When faced with such overwhelming choice, too, sometimes it\u2019s easier to retreat to a film we know won\u2019t disappoint us \u2013 a feeling many who have spent hours scrolling through the endless options on Netflix or Amazon Prime will recognise. If we stumble across a film we love on terrestrial TV, even better \u2013 it feels like the choice is made for us.\n\nRewatching movies can also make us reflect on how we\u2019ve grown \u2013 a subconscious measuring stick for how our much lives have changed\n\nA psychological phenomenon known as the \u2018mere-exposure\u2019 effect \u2013 in which we develop a preference for things that are familiar \u2013 could also be at play. So the more we watch, the more we want to watch. As someone who has gone from thinking The Holiday is one of the worst films I\u2019ve ever seen to watching it without fail every Christmas, I can relate. It\u2019s common for films to become part of traditions like this \u2013 for many, the festive period only officially starts once they\u2019ve seen Elf or Love Actually, and Halloween prompts us to revisit our favourite horrors.\n\nA 2012 study on cultural \u2018reconsumption\u2019 by Cristel Antonia Russell and Sidney J Levy, professors in marketing at the University of Arizona, found that rewatching movies can also make us reflect on how we\u2019ve grown \u2013 a subconscious measuring stick for how much our lives have changed. A 21st-Century version of this came in the form of a response on BBC Culture\u2019s Film Club: \u201cThere are some films I like return to every few years and see them in different formats. For example, the Bond films I\u2019ve seen in the cinema, watched on TV, owned on VHS, then DVD and now digitally downloaded.\u201d\n\nBack to the future\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest reasons why we return to films is nostalgia \u2013 not only for a time in history but for a time in our lives. It\u2019s a natural instinct, says Clay Routledge, a Professor of Psychology at North Dakota State University who studies nostalgia. \u201cWe want to consume new content and have new experiences, of course,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is part of human psychology to want to have some sense of continuity, to feel connected to where we come from. There are certain cultural and personal experiences that we like to return to as a way to anchor ourselves.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also no coincidence that the films we\u2019ve seen the most are ones we first discovered when we were young. \u201cThere seems to be something about identity formation, and the adolescent and teenage years in which things really make an impression on you,\u201d says Routledge. \u201cThat period when you emerge and you\u2019re like: I\u2019m not just some kid in the family anymore, but a unique individual figuring out myself and my interests.\u201d\n\nWhen we feel sad, or lonely, or anxious, or uncertain, we want something that reminds us of where we come from, or who we are \u2013 Clay Routledge\n\nResearch also shows that certain emotional states are more likely to drive us towards nostalgic experiences. \u201cWhen we feel sad, or lonely, or anxious, or uncertain, we want something that reminds us of where we come from, or who we are,\u201d says Routledge. \u201cWe\u2019re more attracted to something that's familiar and that we know we like.\u201d It\u2019s why so many of us have \u2018comfort\u2019 films we put on when we\u2019re feeling uncertain, stressed or ill. There\u2019s something about settling down to a film we know intimately that feels wonderfully soothing \u2013 even if it\u2019s sometimes tinged with melancholy. Another Film Club user chose Waterloo Bridge (1940), commenting: \u201cMaudlin yes, dated, perhaps but somehow reminds me of the pain that wells up whenever I recall an old love affair. In the same vein, and more famously, Brief Encounter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes sense from an evolutionary point of view,\u201d says Routledge. \u201cIf you feel anxious or stressed and your body is telling you there\u2019s reason to worry, that\u2019s not the time to start exploring and taking risks. Obviously\u2026 [that\u2019s more about] feeling physically unsafe, but also when we feel emotionally uncertain we want something that feels safe \u2013 that\u2019s predictable, that we know.\u201d\n\nIn this way, indulging in a little nostalgia can be a good thing, he says. \u201cIt seems to be a natural way that humans gain some sense of stability and security.\u201d So what of the rewatchables of the future? Will any of today\u2019s releases become a Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, Clueless or Star Wars? Will those hardcore Avengers fans still be sitting through Endgame in years to come, notching up their 300th viewing?\n\nNetflix data released at the end of 2018 showed that 50% of people who watched the streaming platform\u2019s original teen rom-coms Kissing Booth and To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before rewatched them at least once \u2013 and both have sequels planned \u2013 but with so much else grappling for Gen Z\u2019s attention, it feels unlikely they\u2019ll cement themselves in the same way.\n\nThere have been recent releases I\u2019ve already revisited several times \u2013 including last year\u2019s A Star Is Born and 2017\u2019s Call Me By Your Name. Whether I\u2019ll still be firing them up in 10 years\u2019 time \u2013 via whatever method we\u2019re watching movies by then \u2013 I\u2019m not sure. If Four Weddings and A Funeral comes on the telly, though, I know exactly what I\u2019ll be doing.\n\nLove film?
