Sign up here.\n\nEvery single state, except for Alaska, has now reported illnesses related to vaping, bringing the nationwide number up to nearly 1,500. But health officials are still unclear about what\u2019s causing the serious lung injuries.\n\nAn update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday laid out the latest figures and facts.\n\nThere have been 1,479 lung injury cases tied to vaping.\n\n33 people have died in 24 states.\n\n70% of the patients were male and 79% of patients were under 35.\n\nAll of the patients reported using vaping products and 78% of patients reported using THC-containing products. And 31% of patients reported exclusively using THC products.\n\nThe CDC reported that in most cases the THC products were obtained from \u201cinformal\u201d sources, meaning off the street, from a friend, or something similar. But while health officials have connected many cases to THC vaping products, they\u2019re still not clear on what chemical, or chemicals, are causing the potentially fatal injuries.\n\nREAD: The vaping crisis has a new villain: \u2018Dank Vapes\u2019\n\n\u201cNo one compound or ingredient has emerged as the cause of these illnesses to date; and it may be that there is more than one cause of this outbreak,\u201d read the CDC\u2019s latest update. \u201cMany different substances and product sources are still under investigation.\u201d\n\nThe first vaping-related death happened in August and the numbers have been rising ever since. The Trump administration plans to ban all flavored vaping products \u2014 although that\u2019s seemingly more an effort to stop kids from vaping, rather than prevent lung injuries. But with the rise in illnesses, health officials want Americans to cut out vaping entirely.\n\n\u201cThe only way to assure that you are not at risk while the investigation continues is to consider refraining from use of all e-cigarette, or vaping, products,\u201d the CDC said Thursday.\n\nJuul, by far the most popular vape brand, has stopped selling certain fruity flavors. Shops across the country, meanwhile, have had to shut down as states and cities enacted bans on certain vaping products.\n\nCover image: FILE - In this Friday, Oct. 4, 2019 photo, a man using an electronic cigarette exhales in Mayfield Heights, Ohio.
