The metro line in the area was also shut as were schools and businesses.\n\nRed flag warnings\n\nAt least 25 buildings have been destroyed by the blaze, the cause of which has not been determined.\n\n\"We've calculated that the fire is moving at a rate of 800 acres [325 hectares] per hour,\" Terrazas said, adding that it would probably take days to get it under control.\n\nSome 200 firefighters, water-dropping helicopters and firefighting aeroplanes were meanwhile battling several blazes, including the one that tore through the trailer park in Riverside County.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries, but authorities ordered some homes in the area be evacuated.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it expects the high winds fanning the flames to subside, making it easier for firefighters to get the situation under control.\n\nA red flag warning - which indicates ripe conditions for wildfires - remains in effect through Saturday.\n\n\"That seems to be the new normal in California,\" lamented Sylmar resident Oscar Mancillas, as he helplessly watched the flames spread in the hillside near his home.\n\n\"I mean the vegetation is so dry ... but we're kind of lucky because it didn't grow back from the last fire,\" he told AFP news agency.\n\n\"In California, you have to be earthquake ready and you have to be fire ready ... and for those of us who have a family, it's a little daunting sometimes.\"\n\n191009150649873\n\nThe wildfires in the south erupted as California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), implemented rolling power blackouts that affected some two million people in northern California this week.\n\nAbout 312,000 customers remained in the dark on Friday as a result of the shutoffs designed to reduce the threat of wildfire that can be sparked by lines downed in strong winds.\n\nMany schools and universities were also closed in northern parts of the state as people stocked up on gasoline, water, batteries and other basics, with frustration mounting at the blackouts condemned by some as \"third world\".\n\n\"We're seeing a scale and scope of something that no state in the 21st century should experience,\" Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday, blaming decades of what he called neglect and mismanagement by PG&E.\n\n\"This is not, from my perspective, a climate change story as much as a story about greed and mismanagement over the course of decades,\" Newsom said. \"Neglect, a desire to advance not public safety but profits.\"\n\nPG&E has defended the outages as necessary for safety reasons and has said it will take days before power is restored to all customers as inspections must be conducted on all power lines and equipment before the lights can be turned back on.\n\n\"This is not how we want to serve you but blackouts can happen again,\" Bill Johnson, the CEO of the company said on Thursday.\n\nLast November, PG&E's faulty power lines were determined to have sparked the deadliest wildfire in the state's modern history, which killed 86 and destroyed the town of Paradise.", "description": "Red flag warnings issued as more than 1,000 firefighters battle blazes and Santa Ana winds fan flames near Los Angeles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/12/b66b17a74cdf4c3090f1ffb87b79f414_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
