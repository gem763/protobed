(Screenshot: Jerome Hellman Productions)\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about the nicest favour that people can do for each other in your city. Now it\u2019s time for the opposite. What\u2019s the biggest way that people in your city ruin things for others?\n\nWhat are the worst habits of the drivers, the bikers, and the pedestrians in your area? Of the rowdy bar-goers, the pushy commuters, the slack-jawed tourists, the snobby lifers, the zombie-eyed laptop caf\u00e9 squatters, the boisterous young, the cranky old, the guillotine-ready rich? And what makes the ones in your city different from all the others?\n\nWhat\u2019s fine in one town is a dick move in another. What mistakes do people make because they don\u2019t know the rules of your particular city? What are the unwritten rules of your area that keep getting violated? (Like the New York rule illustrated above in Midnight Cowboy: the pedestrian is always right.)\n\nOne exception here: While the problem of homelessness may frequently manifest as an inconvenience to you, for the purpose of this post any behaviour of the homeless and very poor is not a \u201cdick move.\u201d We\u2019re confident you will find other more fortunate people to complain about. Thanks for understanding.\n\nOn the larger scale, what are the dick moves your local authorities have pulled? What terrible projects did they inflict on the city, Robert Moses style? How have they screwed over the populace? What companies have littered your streets with flyers or scooters or fro-yo chains that shut down after a month?\n\nMost importantly, how do you deal with all these dick moves, besides moving away to some other city with its own dick moves? What petty revenges do you enact? How do you de-escalate? How do you soothe yourself?\n\nTell us in the comments, and we\u2019ll feature the best ones under the Staff tab.", "description": "We\u2019ve talked about the nicest favour that people can do for each other in your city.
