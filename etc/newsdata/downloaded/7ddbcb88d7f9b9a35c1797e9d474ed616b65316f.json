I think the statue should be removed,\u201d Providence City Councilor Katherine Kerwin told local radio station WPRO News when asked whether she approves of the vandalism.\n\n\u201cI think that healthy civil disobedience is really good for society,\u201d the city council member continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know who did it, but they created a really healthy dialogue in Providence.\u201d\n\nVandals splashed red paint on the statue and chained to the base a sign reading, \u201cstop celebrating genocide.\u201d By Monday, Columbus Day, the paint had been cleaned off.\n\nKerwin is a member of both the committee on city property and the committee on public works.\n\nThe legacy of the Italian explorer, whose 1492 journey to the Americas is credited with discovering a sailing route to the New World, has come under fire in recent years from critics who feel the celebration of his legacy constitutes an endorsement of the genocide of native peoples. Some states have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day or Native American Day.\n\nPresident Trump suggested Wednesday, however, that he intends to keep the holiday official.\n\n\u201cTo me it will always be called Columbus Day,\u201d Trump said Wednesday during a press conference in the Oval Office with Italian President Sergio Mattarella. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like that. I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that he did a good job back then,\u201d Mattarella added.\n\n\u201cI call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities,\u201d Trump said during a proclamation marking October 14 of this year as Columbus Day.", "description": "A Providence, Rhode Island city official said Wednesday she supports the vandalism of a local Christopher Columbus statute, which was covered in paint.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Kevin D.
