Essentially, these changes retarget kids content to a slightly older demographic that isn\u2019t covered by the $170 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over alleged children\u2019s privacy law violations.\n\nDue to the settlement, YouTube will have to stop collecting data on videos that are targeted toward kids under the age of 12, and creators who make videos for children \u2014 such as unboxing toys or art lessons \u2014 will also have to clearly label their content as being intended for kids. For creators, this means any videos they make for kids won\u2019t be eligible to run targeted ads, which they fear could dramatically reduce their revenue.\n\nSeveral prominent full-time personalities are already making changes to avoid the potential fallout. Toya from MyFroggyStuff (2.1 million subscribers), Kelli Maple (1.2 million subscribers), and Rob of Art for Kids (1.9 million subscribers), among others, have all published announcement videos updating their fans about changes they should expect to see, including adjustments to both titles and content. Their goal is to avoid losing revenue by being swept up in YouTube\u2019s broad new category of kids content, which will go into effect on January 1st, 2020, while still keeping their fans happy.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly that we need to make changes here on our channel,\u201d Rob says in the video above. \u201cWe will only post art lessons that are meant for kids that are 13-years-old and up. For the time being, I will leave all of our past lessons on our channel, but eventually these may go away. We\u2019ll still continue to post lessons (for younger kids) over on our app and on our website.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly that we need to make changes here on our channel.\u201d\n\nThe biggest and most worrying change for creators is no longer being able to run targeted ads. These ads make up a significant portion of what\u2019s run on YouTube channels, Melissa Hunter, executive director of a Family Video Network, a group that works with family vloggers, previously told The Verge. Other changes include not being able to send new video notifications \u2014 which can limit a video\u2019s popularity and overall revenue \u2014 and comments being turned off.\n\nRob says he supports YouTube\u2019s decision, but he also has a separate website and app, which include subscription offerings to help supplement his income. That\u2019s not necessarily true for other creators. Toya, who operates MyFroggyStuff, is changing her stage name from Froggy to Toya, updating the style of her thumbnails (to feature miniatures targeted at adults), and adjusting even how she describes things (going from \u201ctoys\u201d to \u201cminiatures\u201d in order to ensure the content is deemed by YouTube as appropriate for all advertisements). Maple, who learned about the changes from Toya\u2019s video, uploaded her own statement on YouTube declaring similar changes were going to be instituted.\n\n\u201cWe will be adding more lifestyle stuff,\u201d Toya told her fans during a live stream. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be vlogging a little bit more, we\u2019re going to be talking about hair ... so yeah, vlogging and everything is on the table.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a shift for some of her fans who skew younger, although Toya said a large portion of her audience is made up of adults, based on information she sees on her internal dashboard. Toys may be labeled by YouTube as something that targets kids, but thanks to mainstream adoption of things like comic book culture and interests in figure collecting, the interest spans beyond them, she added.\n\nYouTube will judge on a video-by-video basis to see whether the content is targeting kids\n\nMany creators who specifically make child-friendly videos left other jobs to work on their YouTube channels full time. In recent years, advertisers worried about controversial content felt safer with family-friendly videos, making these channels some of the most lucrative on YouTube. Now, in wake of the FTC settlement and ongoing restrictions placed on videos that include or target children, that\u2019s changing.\n\nIt\u2019s not just family vloggers and creators who are worried, however. Gaming creators have also been concerned that YouTube\u2019s announcement means that videos involving kid-friendly games \u2014 like Minecraft or Roblox \u2014 could also have their ads limited. It\u2019s a possible dent in a massive market. In 2018, more than 311,000 Minecraft videos were uploaded, bringing in more than 45 billion views, according to analytics firm Tubular Insights.\n\nYouTube is still figuring it out, but it sounds like gaming creators shouldn\u2019t worry just yet. Dan \u201cDanTDM\u201d Middleton, one of YouTube\u2019s most popular gaming creators, says he was told by YouTube that \u201cvideos will not be judged on what game you\u2019re playing (e.g Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite),\u201d adding that a \u201cvideo that is family friendly is not the same as \u2018for kids.\u2019\u201d YouTube will judge on a video-by-video basis to see whether the content is targeting kids, but it won\u2019t be based on any specific game title.\n\nYouTube still hasn't outlined exactly what types of videos will be affected or which creators will have to start planning ahead. CEO Susan Wojcicki addressed the rocky road ahead in a blog post to creators, noting these changes \u201cwill have a significant business impact on family and kids creators.\u201d She added that \u201cthis won\u2019t be easy for some creators and are committed to working with them through this transition.\u201d\n\nToya and Rob are two of those creators who are preparing for a significant impact on their business, and the only thing left to do is pivot.\n\n\u201cFor us who have YouTube as a career, that is kind of detrimental,\u201d Toya said.\n\nCorrection September 11th, 5:04PM ET: Toya is changing her stage name, not her channel name, as this article initially stated. She will now go by Toya on her channel instead of \u201cFroggy,\u201d to ensure that new videos are seen as targeting teens and adults, not children, according to manager Chris Broyles.", "description": "YouTube creators are already making changes to their channels out of fear that they\u2019ll be unable to make money once the platform begins enforcing new limits around kid-friendly content, including changing the names of their channels and shifting content strategy.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGRHnou354nag9G4kg692PlBoT8=/0x0:642x336/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19182000/Screen_Shot_2019_09_08_at_7.43.21_AM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
