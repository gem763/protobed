ABC claims footage from Kentucky gun range shows Turkish attack on Kurdish civilians", "language": "en", "text": "In a scarcely believable display of extreme incompetence or bald-faced lying, ABC News has broadcast footage from a Kentucky gun show, claiming it shows a Turkish assault on Kurdish civilians in northern Syria.\n\nThe news organization made the humiliating fumble on its World News Tonight show on Sunday and then again on Good Morning America on Monday. It featured in a package that was heavily critical of US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria.\n\n\u201cSlaughter in Syria,\u201d the on-screen graphic screamed as anchor Tom Llamas introduced the footage. \u201cThis video, right here, appearing to show Turkey\u2019s military bombing Kurd civilians in a Syrian border town,\u201d Llamas said as the tape rolled.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem, the video wasn\u2019t from northern Syria, it was filmed about 6,200 miles (10,000km) away during a gun show at the Knob Creek Gun Range near West Point, Kentucky.\n\nThe open air gun range holds the dramatic shows twice a year and they have been immortalized in numerous YouTube videos. ABC played a video from 2017 in its Sunday snafu.\n\nViewing the clips clearly shows that it\u2019s the same scene but the video has been edited to crop out the audience watching in the foreground.\n\nAfter broadcasting the fake footage into homes across the US, ABC also uploaded it to YouTube. The video was subsequently deleted when the massive error came to light.\n\nWorld News Tonight issued a correction on Monday, saying that ABC News \u201cregrets the error.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve taken down video that aired on \u2018World News Tonight\u2019 Sunday and \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 this morning that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy,\u201d it tweeted.\n\nABC\u2019s mistake is made even more glaring by the fact that footage from the Kentucky gun show previously went viral in another fake news fail when it was claimed that it showed Kurdish forces destroying Turkish tanks in January 2018. Too bad ABC don\u2019t employ any good fact checkers.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Do people really think we should go to war with NATO member Turkey?' Trump defends Syria withdrawal\n\nLike this story?
