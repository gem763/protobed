If we can make sure that Parliament has a central role in the future negotiations then that\u2019s our democratic opportunity.\u2019\n\nMr Stewart said he agreed with the Bill, but suggested it needed more than the three days\u2019 worth of debate allocated by the government.\n\n\u2018If we are going to deliver Brexit, we need to deliver it in a way that Brexiteers and Remainers believe was taken through Parliament fairly,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean extending until the end of the year but it does mean we need a few days to do it properly. If we don\u2019t do it properly, we are going to undermine the thing from the beginning.\u2019\n\nMPs had more time to debate the Wild Animals in Circuses Act (affecting 19 animals) than they will to decide the future of 65 million people \ud83d\udc2a\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66\ud83e\udd93 It\u2019s hard to think of anything which better illustrates this Govt\u2019s contempt for people, Parliament & democracy #Brexit \u2014 Caroline Lucas (@CarolineLucas) October 22, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaroline Lucas tweeted that ministers had been given more time to debate the Wild Animals in Circuses Act than the Withdrawal Bill.\n\nThe former leader of the Greens added: \u2018It\u2019s hard to think of anything which better illustrates this government\u2019s contempt for people, Parliament and democracy.\u2019\n\nAngela Rayner, Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, also said Parliament must be given enough time to properly scrutinise the Bill.\n\n\u2018Parliament has to be at the centre of everything that happens because that\u2019s what we were doing, weren\u2019t we? Taking back control,\u2019 she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\n\u2018And therefore the control is not for Boris Johnson to have his own little games, it\u2019s about Parliament being able to scrutinise and have a say on what happens.\u2019\n\nShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry agreed more time was needed \u2018for politicians to do their job properly\u2019.\n\nShe told BBC Breakfast: \u2018The idea that we are going to be bounced, as a country, out of the European Union in a few days, without politicians being given a chance to look carefully at the basis on which we\u2019re making this decision, is wrong.\u2019\n\nLeader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg said those who do not vote for the programme motion \u2018will noy be voting for Brexit\u2019 by Halloween (Picture: UK Parliament/EPA)\n\nHowever, Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg warned on Monday that the programme motion was essential if they were to meet the Halloween deadline.\n\n\u2018People who do not vote for the programme motion will not be voting for Brexit on October 31,\u2019 he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first vote on Tuesday will be on the Bill\u2019s \u2018in principle\u2019 second reading.\n\nDespite the opposition of the DUP over arrangements for Northern Ireland, ministers believe they have the support of pro-Leave Labour rebels and former Tory MPs now sitting as independents who would rather leave with Mr Johnson\u2019s deal than no deal at all.\n\nIf they get through the second reading, the government will hope it gives the momentum to carry through the programme motion as well.\n\nIf that passes, under the proposed timetable, the Bill would then move to the committee stage \u2013 which will continue on into Wednesday \u2013 when MPs will have the opportunity to put down amendments.\n\nThese are expected to include attempts to keep the UK more closely aligned with the EU through a customs union and to stage a second referendum.\n\nBoth are bitterly opposed by the government, raising the possibility that it could pull the Bill altogether if either gets through.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
