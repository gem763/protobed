Protestors see this as a threat to democracy and have taken to the streets to air their grievances.\n\nSo far, protestors in Hong Kong have been using Telegram groups to coordinate efforts as they continue to rally against Chinese control. The app has been used to discuss tactics and warn other protestors of the latest methods employed by the police against protestors, such as spreading colored tear gas to mark protestors for arrest. But the Chinese government was able to use a bug that could allow it to get hold of users\u2019 phone numbers, helping them to disrupt communications.\n\nTelegram since fixed the exploit after Hong Kong protestors pushed on the app to cloak their identities, according to a report by Reuters, on Friday. But it was too late. Many protesters had abandoned the app in favor of more unconventional means of communication.\n\nTelegram: the messaging app driving Hong Kong\u2019s decentralized revolution\n\nIn the last few weeks, Bridgefy and FireChat, two peer-to-peer messaging apps, have boomed in popularity in the region.\n\nBridgefy is an offline messaging app that creates a mesh network of its users\u2019 mobile phones via bluetooth. This allows them to send messages from phone to phone, until they reach their destinations.\n\nBridgefy, according to AppTrace, is currently the is the sixth most popular app in Hong Kong, and was the most popular app in the country at certain times during the middle of August. This is a sharp increase considering that, at the beginning of last month, Bridgefy ranked just #153.\n\nOn the other side of the world, Bridgefy also surged in rankings in the Bahamas\u2014it is now the 59th most popular app\u2014coinciding with the deadly Hurricane Dorian.\n\nFireChat is also highly popular and works in much the same way as Bridgefy. Its iOS app was the tenth most downloaded app in Hong Kong in the middle of August according to AppTrace, though, as of yesterday, it is the #58 most popular app. The Android version was the fourteenth most popular app in the same time period, though it is now the 52nd most popular app.\n\nWith the internet so heavily controlled in China\u2014and largely centralized across the world\u2014is it time for peer-to-peer technologies to have another moment in the sun?\n\n\n\n", "description": "New apps rush to fill a gap in the market caused by a breach in Telegram\u2019s security software.", "authors": ["Robert Stevens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/58owhPGKmrTPwz3NMG3BEA--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/6921be935a262e923f02e5a547b75164"}
