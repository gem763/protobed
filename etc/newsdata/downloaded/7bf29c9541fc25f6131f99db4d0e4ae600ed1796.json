Shortly after, Johnson was defeated by Parliament in his attempt to call a general election.\n\nThere is also mounting anger within the Conservative Party on Johnson\u2019s decision to expel 21 Conservative Members of Parliament (MP) from the party, who were all opposed to letting Britain leave the European Union without a deal.\n\nBut, according to President Donald Trump, Johnson is, in fact, doing a superb job. \u201cBoris is a friend of mine and he\u2019s going at it, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cHe knows how to win, Boris knows how to win. Don\u2019t worry about him he\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, on Thursday Johnson \u2014 who once said that Trump had a \u201cquite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of the president of the United States\u201d \u2014 suffered yet another defeat. And this one was much more personal: Jo Johnson, Boris\u2019 younger brother and a Conservative MP, resigned from Parliament.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks I\u2019ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest,\u201d Jo Johnson tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s an unsolvable tension and time for others to take on my roles as MP & Minister.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Johnson\u2019s own brother has resigned from his government, barely a month-and-a-half into his tenure as prime minister, highlights the intractable Conservative civil war at the heart of the Brexit debate, which has completely fractured the party.\n\nThis is further emphasized by the prominence of a few of the MPs expelled by Johnson earlier this week, which includes former chancellor of the Exchequer (the second-most important position in British politics) Phillip Hammond, as well as Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill about whom, ironically enough, Johnson previously wrote a biography.\n\nTrump, for his part, previously promised that \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a very big trade deal \u2014 bigger than we\u2019ve ever had with the U.K.\u201d But whether that would actually happen is, as with everything Brexit-related, very much an open question. Such a trade deal would inevitably anger the United States\u2019 trading partners within the European Union (both the individual countries and the block as a whole).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s more, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has warned that Congress would block any legislation if it undermines the Good Friday peace agreement concerning Northern Ireland. The key debate is over the border separating the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.\n\nEuropean officials are desperate to preserve the \u201cbackstop\u201d (i.e. a seamless border between Northern Ireland and the Republic) which was one of the key provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. Johnson, however, has been repeatedly pushing for a hard border between the two countries.\n\n\u201cWhatever form it takes, Brexit cannot be allowed to imperil the Good Friday agreement, including the seamless border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, especially now, as the first generation born into the hope of Good Friday 21 years ago comes into adulthood,\u201d Pelosi said earlier in August. \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1166061369.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
