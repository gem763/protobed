These international multilateral and bilateral frameworks allow law enforcement agencies of both countries to collaborate on matters of common interest like fighting corruption and ensuring that perpetrators of corruption have nowhere to hide.\"\n\nLamola said in the context of this international and domestic legal framework, South Africa and the US have enjoyed close collaboration on matters of mutual legal assistance.\n\n\"Under the umbrella of the International Co-operation in Criminal Matters Act, South African law enforcement agencies have issued mutual legal assistance requests to eight countries around the world, including the United States of America.\"\n\nHe has vowed to ensure that these requests would be expedited.\n\n\"It is of critical importance that our young democracy confronts corruption and its antecedent effects expeditiously. I welcome the collaborative efforts by the US government in the country's fight against corruption.
