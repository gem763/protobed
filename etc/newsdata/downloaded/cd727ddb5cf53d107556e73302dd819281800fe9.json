(Picture: AMA/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Liverpool won\u2019t go unbeaten, not a chance,\u2019 former Arsenal midfielder Merson told Sky Sports.\n\n\u2018What Arsenal did all those years ago, that\u2019s some going. What Liverpool are doing, winning all these games on the trot, though, is ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They weren\u2019t great the other day. When Leicester got to 1-1, they looked like the team that might nick it, even though Liverpool didn\u2019t deserve to lose.\n\n\u2018For 70-odd minutes they were the better team, but they just kept on going and you have to get some breaks every now and again.\n\n\u2018No-one is going to look back on October 5 and remember the penalty, but that spot-kick could\u2019ve been a massive, massive goal.\n\n\u2018When you win league titles, everybody forgets about what happens in October and November.\n\n\u2018Everybody just thinks about what happened in April or May, but the penalty could be massive in the context of the title race.\u2019\n\nMerson wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say the title race is already over, but he certainly thinks it\u2019s Liverpool\u2019s to lose.\n\nPep Guardiola\u2019s side are already playing catch up (Picture: AMA/Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve said before that this side is not getting beat by any side in the bottom half and Manchester City have been beaten by two teams in the bottom half already,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve got the points on the board and can afford a slip here or there. Manchester City could beat Liverpool twice now and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. It\u2019s all in their hands now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s Liverpool\u2019s title to throw away because there\u2019s a long way to go.\n\n\u2018No-one has ever won the league in eight football matches, but if they keep on doing what they are doing, it\u2019s going to be hard for anybody else to catch them.\n\n\u2018The players had the title snatched from them last year. It was taken away from them after Man City won 14 straight football matches and Vincent Kompany stuck one in the top corner from 30 yards.\n\n\u2018Liverpool know things can happen. This Manchester City team can get on a roll and reel off 10 on the trot so there\u2019s a long, long way to go.\u2019\n\nMORE: Liverpool are \u2018too far ahead for everybody else\u2019 in the Premier League, says Arsene Wenger\n\nMORE: How much it will cost Manchester United to sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer", "description": "Paul Merson believes there's no chance Liverpool will follow in the footsteps of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' by remaining unbeaten throughout the Premier League season but hailed their 'ridiculous' 17-match winning streak....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1416152291_1570529657.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
