The survey, conducted in conjunction with Harris Interactive, zeroed in on eight factors that the happiest respondents had in common.\n\nWomen place more value on emotional and financial stability, while men tend to find happiness, physical attraction and health as the most desirable traits.\n\nFive of the eight factors: They had a healthy sex life and an equal balance of economic power, were most likely to be younger (between the ages of 25 and 44), have two kids, each earn at least $75,000 a year and have a B.A. than their unhappier counterparts. Couples also noted two more things: Improved awareness of social justice issues and similar political convictions correlated with happiness.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: This couple never talks about money\u2014and they never fight about it either\n\n\u201cEducation and political similarities are more important now than they were five years ago,\u201d Grant Langston, chief executive officer of eHarmony told MarketWatch. \u201cMany of the happiest couples vote and are also very aware of social justice issues.\u201d In fact, some people are adamant about not dating people from the opposite of the political spectrum, he added.\n\nBut men and women seem to differ in what they think makes their partner happy. \u201cMen think that women want gifts, but women want words of affirmation,\u201d Langston said. Aside from the obvious attractions of a healthy physique, people said they found happy, stable and intelligent people desirable. In fact, he said these qualities were deemed as important as a regular sex life.\n\nHere\u2019s what else eHarmony found\n\n\u2022 70% report sharing a life together is more important than marriage, although 55% said marriage would make their relationship happier.\n\n\u2022 44% of couples said they\u2019re dealing with mental-health issues in their relationship, which may include depression, anxiety, ADHD or bipolar disorder.\n\n\u2022 Only 1 in 5 women reported feeling more empowered as a result of #MeToo and 32% of men said they feel less confident to make the first move with a woman.\n\n\u2022 Those who sought a long-term relationship from the outset were 11% happier than those who were seeking something casual when they first met.\n\n\u2022 Women place more value on emotional and financial stability, while men tend to find happiness, physical attraction and health as the most desirable traits in a mate.\n\n\u2022 42% of people consider their relationship equal in terms of power and economics, whereas only 26% of unhappy couples said the same thing.\n\n\u2022 Over 60% of LGBT couples say their relationship is more focused on quality time than sex, although they tend to have more sex than their heterosexual counterparts.\n\neHarmony and LGBT singletons\n\neHarmony has a complicated history with matching same-sex couples. In 2005, Eric McKinley, a gay man from New Jersey, filed a complaint against eHarmony for not catering to LGBT people. In 2008, eHarmony agreed to pay McKinley $5,000 and provide him with one-year complimentary membership. eHarmony was not found in violation of any law, but agreed to provide an LGBT dating service under a separate brand, Compatible Partners.\n\neHarmony\u2019s legal counsel in that case, Theodore Olson, said in 2008 that the complain was an \u201cunfair\u201d characterization of the business, but agreed to settle. In response to the settlement, Olson said the case \u201chad been a burden for the company, and continuing to advance its business model of serving individuals by helping them find successful, long-term relationships.\u201d However, the company maintains two separate brands for LGBTQ and heterosexual couples.\n\nMen and women often look for different things\n\nAn earlier 2015 study published in the peer-reviewed academic journal \u201cPersonality and Individual Differences\u201d said women felt it was more important that their partner made at least as much money as they did (46% versus 24% of men) and had a successful career (61% versus 33% of men), while men favored a slender body (80% versus 58% of women).\n\nMen were more focused on looks whereas women said financial status was more important in choosing a partner. Men with higher incomes showed stronger preferences for women with slender bodies, while women with higher incomes preferred men who had a steady income, the survey of 28,000 heterosexual men and women aged between 18 and 75.\n\nAlso see: The larger the rock, the rockier the marriage\n\nDebt, however, is a no-no when it comes to choosing a partner. More than 77% of people consider credit-card debt an unattractive trait in a mate, according to a recent report released by personal-finance site Finder.com. On average, people say $11,525 in credit-card debt is enough of a red flag to swipe left or walk away from a potential partner.\n\nPayday loans, which can have rates as high as 400%, are the second most unacceptable forms of debt for daters. As such, it only takes a payday loan of $1,830 to turn off a potential partner. Given that Americans carry $1.5 trillion in student debt, student loans are also off-putting to prospective dates and, on average, anything above $51,000 could be a deal-breaker.", "description": "A recent report by eHarmony looks at what happy couples could tell us about finance and romance.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD534_HappyC_ZG_20190207120057.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-07"}
