The new additions almost double Schwab's lineup of bond ETFs to seven from four.\n\nSchwab 1-5 Year Corporate Bond ETF (SCHJ)\n\nThe Schwab 1-5 Year Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: SCHJ) targets the Bloomberg Barclays US 1-5 Year Corporate Bond Index and only features corporate bonds with $300 million or more of outstanding face value.\n\nThough interest rates have been falling, enticing investors to embrace longer duration fare, short-term corporate bond funds in the investment-grade category, where SCHJ, remain popular with risk-averse income investors.\n\nEstablished rivals to SCHJ yield in the area of 3% and have been solid though not spectacular performers this year.\n\nSee Also: Best Online Stock Trading Brokers\n\nSchwab 5-10 Year Corporate Bond ETF (SCHI)\n\nFor investors willing to take on more interest rate risk, the Schwab 5-10 Year Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: SCHI) should deliver a high income level than its stablemate SCHJ.\n\nSCHI tracks the Bloomberg Barclays US 5-10 Year Corporate Bond Index and is considered an intermediate-term bond fund. Investment-grade corporate bonds in this category often yield in the 3.50% neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThese three new ETFs are designed to address the needs that our clients tell us are most important to them,\u201d Schwab also notes. \u201cWe are pleased to offer these new low cost ETFs now, as investors are increasingly looking to bond ETFs as a potential source of diversification, liquidity and income.\n\nSchwab Long-Term U.S. Treasury ETF (SCHQ)\n\nThe Schwab Long-Term U.S. Treasury ETF (NYSE: SCHQ) follows the Bloomberg Barclays US Long Treasury Index and of the three ETFs highlighted here, may be the one destined for the best near-term performance if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates once or twice before the end of this year.\n\n\u201cLong government funds concentrate on bonds backed by the U.S. government or by government-linked agencies,\u201d according to Schwab. \u201cBecause these funds have durations of more than six years, they are more sensitive to interest rates, and thus riskier, than funds that have shorter durations.\u201d\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
