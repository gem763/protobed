(Gabriella Demczuk/The New York Times)\n\nPresident Donald Trump portrayed the \u201cPhase 1\u201d agreement he announced Friday with China with typical fanfare, describing the pact as \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cthe largest contract\u201d ever signed.\n\n\u201cWe made a fantastic deal,\u201d Trump said during remarks Tuesday at the White House.\n\nThere are good reasons to be skeptical about those claims. The deal appears likely to benefit American farmers by increasing Chinese purchases of agricultural goods and gives some other businesses more access to the Chinese market. But the \u201cagreement in principle\u201d is limited in scope and exact details have yet to be put in writing \u2014 a process that has derailed negotiations with China in the past.\n\nU.S. officials said Friday that they would work with China on finalizing an initial agreement in the coming weeks, with hopes of signing a deal when Trump and President Xi Jinping attend a summit of global leaders in Chile in mid-November.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far about what the agreement might contain.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the Deal\n\n\u2014 Agricultural Products\n\nFrom Trump\u2019s perspective, the centerpiece of the pact is a commitment by China to purchase between $40 billion to $50 billion of American agricultural products per year. Administration officials said that target would be reached within the second year of the pact\u2019s enactment.\n\nThat volume would represent a huge increase over what China was purchasing before the start of the trade war. American farm exports to China peaked at around $25.5 billion in 2016, according to the American Farm Bureau, then dipped to $24.3 billion in 2017.\n\nSince then, exports of soybeans, pork and other products have collapsed under pressure from the trade war. American farm exports to China fell to just $13.4 billion in 2018 and are on track for a similar total this year, according to the same data.\n\nU.S. officials have not specified which products would be purchased, or how they arrived at a $50 billion figure. But to many analysts, that level of exports seems hard to achieve. Trump himself acknowledged this on Saturday, saying in a tweet that \u201cthere is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!\u201d the president added.\n\nOne factor that could sharply drive up China\u2019s imports is its African swine fever epidemic. China has already lost about 40% of its hog herd to the sickness, increasing demand for foreign pork and other meats.\n\nThe $50 billion target may also include a generous estimate of how other parts of the agreement would affect sales. U.S. officials said they had negotiated speedier food safety checks for imports into China and approvals for genetically modified products, both of which could boost trade.\n\nGeng Shuang, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, confirmed at a news conference Tuesday that China would speed up its purchases of American farm goods. \u201cWhat the U.S. is saying is the actual situation, which is consistent with what we know,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 No New Tariffs, For Now\n\nFrom China\u2019s perspective, the biggest win is a promise by Trump to cancel an Oct. 15 tariff increase, when taxes on $250 billion of Chinese goods were set to rise to 30% from 25%.\n\nU.S. officials could also cancel plans to impose a 15% tax on another roughly $150 billion of goods in December if things go well.\n\nBut that still leaves a huge swath of tariffs intact. Since the start of the trade war, the United States has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products, while China has placed tariffs on roughly $100 billion of American imports.\n\n\u2014 Opening China\u2019s Financial Markets\n\nTrump administration officials said that China has pledged to open its markets to American financial services firms and that banks and credit card companies would be the primary beneficiaries. But few details have been offered and many of these changes are already in the works for other countries.\n\nUnder heavy American pressure, China has announced a series of moves over the past two years to open up its banking and other financial services sectors, allowing higher levels of foreign ownership or even removing ownership caps entirely. But China is unilaterally opening up its financial services sector to businesses from all over the world, not just from the United States.\n\nSome trade experts say the gains to American companies may be limited, pointing out that China has delayed opening its markets for so long that Chinese companies already dominate the financial sector.", "description": "President Donald Trump portrayed the \"Phase 1\" agreement he announced Friday with China with typical fanfare, describing the pact as \"massive\" and \"the largest contract\" ever signed.\"We made a fantastic deal,\" Trump said during remarks Tuesday at the White House.There", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Keith Bradsher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/19s4yRhC9ajxB4ltg55ssA--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/338f8ea8c0a050bfed0429c2df79483d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
