We\u2019ll take a comprehensive look across the DFS industry to uncover these core recommendations, factoring respective salaries into the analysis.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nWe will be looking at the 11-game main afternoon slate starting at 1:05 ET.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPITCHER\n\nJustin Verlander - Houston (vs. LA Angels)\n\nVerlander is the top ace on this slate, and it\u2019s not even close. Sure, you\u2019ll have to shell out a hefty premium to make him work, but we\u2019ll show you enough cheap bats throughout this article to make that a reality. The AL Cy Young frontrunner has been amazing this season, holding a 2.50 ERA with 283 strikeouts across 212 innings. He\u2019s gunning for his 20th win of the season today, and smart money says he\u2019ll get there with ease.\n\nAlso Consider: Dallas Keuchel, Reynaldo Lopez (tournaments)\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMike Ford - NY Yankees (vs. Toronto)\n\nFord is one of those bargain candidates that will make it easier to afford Verlander at pitcher. The NYY left-handed slugger will look to pounce on the hitter-friendly dimension of Yankee Stadium (short right-field porch) against Toronto RHP Trent Thornton\u2019s vulnerable .339 wOBA split to lefty hitters. Ford is brimming with confidence after going 2-4 with three RBIs yesterday, and this is an excellent spot to keep the momentum.\n\nAlso Consider: Freddie Freeman, Eric Thames\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nLuis Arraez - Minnesota (vs. Kansas City)\n\nStory continues\n\nArraez has been a hitting machine this season while holding a .347 average through 303 at-bats. He\u2019s a candidate to leadoff for the Twins this afternoon, which puts him in excellent run-scoring opportunities ahead of Bomba Squad pieces like Nelson Cruz, Eddie Rosario, and Miguel Sano. The matchup looks great as well, facing Kansas City RHP Jorge Lopez\u2019s .368 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Needless to say, Arraez is a candidate for multiple hits and runs in this one.\n\nAlso Consider: Ozzie Albies, Whit Merrifield\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nMike Moustakas - Milwaukee (vs. Pittsburgh)\n\nThe Yankees, Twins, Brewers, and Astros represent the top stacks of this afternoon slate (followed by the Braves). Milwaukee finds themselves in a healthy situation in their hitter-friendly ballpark against Pittsburgh RHP Trevor Williams, who has allowed 11 earned runs and 14 hits across eight innings over his past two starts. I\u2019m expecting the Brewers to inflict damage along those lines, and Moustakas is a strong (literally) candidate to lead the way.\n\nAlso consider: Miguel Sano, Hunter Dozier\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nAdeiny Hechavarria - Atlanta (vs. San Francisco)\n\nHere\u2019s another dirt-cheap option to make room for Verlander. We\u2019ll need to double-check the lineup card before selecting Hechavarria, but he\u2019s an interesting bargain candidate nonetheless. This is a promising draw against San Francisco RHP Logan Webb, who holds a .400+ wOBA split to right-handed bats throughout his brief MLB career \u2026 If Hechavarria isn\u2019t in the lineup, my backup plan for saving goes through LaMonte Wade Jr. and/or Jake Cave in Minnesota\u2019s outfield.\n\nAlso Consider: Didi Gregorius, Carlos Correa\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nEddie Rosario - Minnesota (vs. Kansas City)\n\nI mentioned it earlier, but the Bomba Squad should be able to extend their home run total this afternoon. They\u2019ll step in against Kansas City RHP Lopez and his aforementioned .368 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Rosario has collected multiple hits in four of his last seven games, and he has multi-homer upside in his back pocket. Perhaps that will surface in Minnesota\u2019s final regular-season home game?\n\nTrent Grisham - Milwaukee (vs. Pittsburgh)\n\nThe rookie is swinging a confident bat while going 5-7 with seven RBIs, four runs, and a stolen base over his past three games. As mentioned earlier, the Brewers\u2019 offense finds themselves in an excellent spot against the recent struggles of Pittsburgh RHP Williams. Grisham will hold a premium lineup spot within that, profiling as an encouraging \u201cper dollar\u201d DFS candidate to continue the recent tear.\n\nAlso consider: George Springer, Bryan Reynolds, Adam Eaton, Brett Gardner, Josh Reddick, LaMonte Wade Jr. (punt), Jake Cave (punt)", "description": "Spencer Limbach finds the best MLB DFS Plays for the afternoon slate on Sunday, September 22.
