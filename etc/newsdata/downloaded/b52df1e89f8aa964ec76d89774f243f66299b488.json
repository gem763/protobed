This means a net can save lives without anyone even using it.\n\n\u201cStudies have shown that when nets or barriers have been installed on [bridges], they have dramatically reduced the number of deaths by suicide \u2014 not only in that location but in the surrounding area as a whole,\u201d van Tulleken says.\n\nKevin Briggs, formerly a highway patrol officer on California\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge, was part of a campaign to build a safety net along the world-famous structure. Construction just started in 2018, with completion estimated for 2021.\n\nIn his roughly 17 years patrolling the bridge, Briggs talked down many would-be jumpers. He calls suicide an \u201cimpulsive act,\u201d adding that without the means available, crises tend to pass and lives can be saved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping this will stop suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge altogether,\u201d he says.\n\nUsing A.I. to predict suicide is 90 per cent accurate\n\nPredicting who is at risk is key to reducing suicide deaths. Unfortunately, no single factor, or small group of factors, can predict who will attempt or die from suicide \u201c[any] better than a coin flip,\u201d says Dr. Joe Franklin of Florida State University.\n\nMachine learning algorithms, however, have potential, since they can rapidly process seemingly infinite amounts of data. Franklin\u2019s research team uses Americans\u2019 health records and machine learning algorithms to analyze up to 800 factors at a time, and has developed a prediction model with unprecedented success.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to predict both non-fatal suicide attempts and suicide death with about 90 per cent accuracy, a few years before it happens,\u201d Franklin says. The next frontier of this technology, he adds, is working with front-line clinicians to put the prediction model into practical use.\n\nAsk patients if they have suicidal thoughts\n\nAnother simple solution has reduced suicides by 80 per cent for patients served by one Michigan health-care provider.\n\nThe Henry Ford Health System\u2019s \u201czero suicides\u201d initiative is fairly straightforward: primary care doctors ask every patient, regardless of what health issue they came for, if they have had suicidal thoughts. At-risk patients are then offered support, whether it\u2019s through therapy, medication or home visits to help remove firearms.\n\n\u201cOur suicide rate decreased by 80 per cent, and we even had some years where it was zero,\u201d says Dr. Cathrine Frank, one of the founders of the program. \u201cIf we change the way we think about health care, we can prevent suicides.\u201d\n\nTalk to loved ones\n\nScreening for suicidal thoughts isn\u2019t limited to hospital care. All of us can reach out to family or friends that may be isolated or going through a rough time, van Tulleken says.\n\n\u201cTurn to the person next to you or phone a mate and ask them \u2014 not just, \u2018Are you doing OK?\u2019 but, \u2018Are you thinking about killing yourself?\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nTalking about suicidal thoughts can encourage people to seek help, says psychology professor Rory O\u2019Connor, director of the Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory in Scotland. It can also remind the person that someone cares for them.\n\n\u201cAsking somebody directly whether they\u2019re suicidal can actually protect them,\u201d O\u2019Connor says. \u201cReaching out in moments of crisis can save a life.\u201d\n\nTo learn more, watch Dying for Help on The Passionate Eye.\n\nIf you are in a crisis, call 1-833-456-4566, available 24/7, or visit crisisservicescanada.ca for text or chat options.", "description": "Just talking about suicide, for one, can encourage people to seek help", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbc.ca/passionateeye/content/images/episodes/SuicidePrevention_1920.jpg"}
