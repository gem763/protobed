For many experts, policymakers, and seniors, it\u2019s not enough.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that most seniors face cost increases each year even beyond what\u2019s reflected in the current law COLA, since they spend a disproportionate amount of their income on health care costs, which rise faster than general inflation,\u201d said Rep. John B. Larson (D-CT), chair of the House\u2019s Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee.\n\nSocial Security recipients will see a 1.6% increase this year. But for many, it's not enough. (Getty Creative) More\n\n\u201cSocial Security is the largest source of retirement income for most retirees,\u201d said AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins in a statement following the news. \u201cSo today\u2019s announcement of a 1.6% COLA increase, while modest, will help Social Security beneficiaries and their families as they try to keep up with rising prices.\u201d\n\nStill, Jenkins noted, the adjustments typically don\u2019t keep pace with increases in the expenses most seniors face. One major problem: the benchmark the Administration uses doesn\u2019t represent the expenses of seniors.\n\nThis increase uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) to determine the cost of living adjustment, so the 1.6% number announced Thursday did not come as a surprise.\n\nHealth care and prescription drug costs, the AARP said, especially affect seniors\u2019 living expenses, and in the past 12 consecutive years retail drug prices have exceeded the inflation rate. Furthermore, in 2017, drug prices rose twice as fast as inflation.\n\n\u201cThe 2020 COLA of 1.6% will do little, if anything, to help the millions of federal retirees who spent their working years serving the public,\u201d said National Association of Retired Federal Employees National President Ken Thomas. \u201cThe same people face a 5.6% average increase next year to health care insurance premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, alone.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security checks is less than the previous two years. (Yahoo Finance) More\n\nThe Seniors League, an advocacy group, noted a similar problem: That premiums for Medicare\u2019s supplemental insurance, also called Medigap, grew twice as fast as the Social Security adjustment.\n\nRep. Larson, the chair of the subcommittee on Social Security, has proposed using the special consumer price index for seniors, the CPI-E, which would provide more generous increases.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem in all of this for seniors is that the insufficiency of each annual cost-of-living adjustment compounds. Since the adjustment is adjusted from the year before, the gaps snowball each time. Analysis by the Seniors League found that the benefits are about 17.5% less than they would have been if the cost-of-living adjustment had been a more generous 3%. For the average Social Security recipient, that\u2019s $17,299 less than it would have been.", "description": "The Social Security Administration announced the 2020 increase in payments to retirees.
