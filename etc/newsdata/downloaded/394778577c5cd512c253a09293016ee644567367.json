We\u2019ve been hearing hints and suggestions for some time now alluding to the idea that the group has been in possession of certain \u201cexotic materials\u201d that might hold the secret to technological breakthroughs straight out of a science fiction novel. But now, in addition to vague claims put forward by the group, they\u2019ve announced that they\u2019ve entered into an agreement with the United States Army to work on new technological breakthroughs to benefit ground vehicles.\n\n#TTSA has announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the @usarmy CCDC to advance our materiel and technology innovations in order to develop enhanced capabilities for Army ground vehicles. Press release and offering circular: https://t.co/6wgbccWShM pic.twitter.com/gP1rJTtbG4 \u2014 To The Stars Academy (@TTSAcademy) October 17, 2019\n\nYou can read the TTSA announcement here. As usual, it\u2019s overly vague and mysterious but certainly seems to hint at\u2026 something. (Emphasis added)\n\nTo The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (TTSA) announced today a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command to advance TTSA\u2019s materiel and technology innovations in order to develop enhanced capabilities for Army ground vehicles. TTSA\u2019s technology solutions, which leverage developments in material science, space-time metric engineering, quantum physics, beamed energy propulsion, and active camouflage, have the potential to enhance survivability and effectiveness of multiple Army systems\u2026\n\nThat emphasized list of technologies is enough to leave many of us reaching for a stiff drink, but keep an eye on them. Particularly that last one. \u201cActive camouflage?\u201d What\u2019s that about?\n\nWhen I first read the press release I got a bit snarky and asked if TTSA\u2019s \u201cexotic materials\u201d would be used to build better snow tires for Jeeps. But I quickly got some feedback from quantum physicist Deep Prasad (who I interviewed here previously) suggesting something far more remarkable.\n\nWe can assume theyre going to implement invisibility cloaking for said vehicles. Since Hal said the metamaterial has a negative refractive index and that's one of the minimum requirements for invisibility if one used a metamaterial. \u2014 Deep Prasad (@Deepneuron) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cWe can assume they\u2019re going to implement invisibility cloaking for said vehicles. Since Hal said the metamaterial has a negative refractive index and that\u2019s one of the minimum requirements for invisibility if one used a metamaterial.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry. Did you just say \u201cinvisibility cloaking?\u201d Granted, whenever I\u2019m talking to Deep I generally only understand about one out of four words that he says, and this is no exception. But it apparently has something to do with \u201cartificial gravitational lensing\u201d that could theoretically bend incoming light around an object (like a Jeep or a tank, for example) rendering it invisible.\n\nIt all seems to come back to these mysterious \u201cexotic materials\u201d or \u201cmetamaterials\u201d that TTSA supposedly has in their possession and has been testing. One description that DeLonge put out on social media suggested dozens of alternating layers of three different elements, each only a few molecules thick, somehow bonded together and demonstrating remarkable properties. You can read a particularly dense explanation of this part of the story and it\u2019s history here or you can watch this short \u201ctrailer\u201d that TTSA released about the exotic materials. They\u2019re calling it The ADAM Project.\n\nAnd now they\u2019ve got the Army signed on to work with them. This leaves us with so many questions. Could this all be real? Are these materials possibly from some civilization not of this world? That last question begs an immediate follow-up. If these alleged aliens are so advanced that they can travel across the galaxy, why do they keep crashing often enough for us to have all this wreckage? (That\u2019s only partially a joke.) But then there\u2019s the big question. Are we supposed to believe that TTSA came up with parts of an alien spacecraft but our government and our military never knew anything about it? One particularly clever explanation showed up on a Twitter account that covers disclosure issues closely.\n\nTTSA: \u201cHey, look what we found!\u201d\n\nUS Gov.: \u201cWow! We never knew! Anything! Ever! That\u2019s an amazing find!\u201d\n\nTTSA: \u201cWe know you never knew anything. Ever. Never, ever. (wink, wink)\n\nUS Gov.: \u201cWe can totally use that! Oh, and thanks for telling everyone!\u201d (wink, wink) https://t.co/B8Am2aNfAe \u2014 AskTheQuestion (@AskTheQuestionZ) October 17, 2019\n\nVery amusing, but if more information about these amazing technologies comes out and it really does have an off-world source, the government has a lot of questions to answer to the public. But with that said, some of these discoveries could fundamentally change the entire future of mankind. And like all major advances, that could work to our great advantage or end up with us destroying ourselves. Stay tuned.\n\nUPDATE: (2:20 pm) John Greenewald of The Black Vault has already obtained a copy of the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) from the Army and published it here. John has been ferreting government documents out into the public eye for decades using FOIA requests so this is legitimate. It\u2019s 27 pages long, but as with most government documents, 26 of the pages are mostly boilerplate. The only really interesting part (at least to me) is ARTICLE 3: OBJECTIVE(s) on page 8. But even that is short on specifics. Worth a look, though. It also contains more contact information for people involved in the project on both sides.", "description": "Invisibility technology?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Elizondo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
