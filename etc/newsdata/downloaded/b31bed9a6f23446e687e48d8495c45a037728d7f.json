The car has an alloy skin over a steel frame construction and cars built this way tend to take around 4000 to 4500 hours to restore over a period of 18-24 months. Thornley Kelham opted to outsource the metalwork this time, with it being handled by Gary Pitney at GP Panelcraft.\n\nThornley Kelham does have an excellent reputation for paintwork, however, so that challenge was kept in house. From bare metal, the paintwork took 800 hours to complete, with an impeccable attention to detail being applied throughout.\n\nThornley Kelham claims 'Restoration of the Year' gong for work on rare Italian GT More\n\nSadly not everything could remain original. The brakes were swapped out for Dunlop-style ones that will better suit the car's regular use, but that would be the only major change. Even the original welding, some of which was described as 'terrible' by Thornley Kelham, remained.\n\nThe car's restoration was eventually completed in time for the 2018 Concours of Elegance at Hampton Court Palace.\n\nThornley Kelham claims 'Restoration of the Year' gong for work on rare Italian GT More\n\n\"This restoration was the result of a huge outpouring of research, skill, dedication and passion by the whole Thornley Kelham team, and we\u2019e delighted to see it receiving such acclaim,\" said Thornley Kelham co-founder Simon Thornley. \"This prestigious award follows much praise not only from this car\u2019s fastidious owner but also from the world\u2019s pre-eminent Bizzarrini expert, Jack Koobs de Hartogs. We\u2019re delighted to have been given the opportunity to maintain such an important piece of automotive history.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "The restored Bizzarrini 5300 GT Strada belongs to Guy Berryman.", "authors": ["Feedback", "Dominik Wilde"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6OGhN1emT.0yt2RKfp8kSQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/motor1_uk_340/ce065e1b519b1dd67f077b0c3707d7e1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
