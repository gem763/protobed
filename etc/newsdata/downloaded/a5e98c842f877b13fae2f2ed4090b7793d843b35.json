REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo\n\nThe film, \u201cCitizen K\u201d, was made by Oscar-winning U.S. filmmaker Alex Gibney and premiered at the Venice Film festival this weekend. It was based on more than 24 hours of interviews that Khodorkovsky, who is now based in Britain, gave over a period of months.\n\nIt tells the story of Khodorkovsky\u2019s dramatic 2003 arrest on an icy Siberian runway by armed men and his fall from grace, punishment for what he and his supporters believe was his interest in Russian politics and fighting corruption.\n\nThe bespectacled tycoon, then head of the now defunct Yukos oil company, went on to serve a decade in jail on fraud charges he says were politically motivated before being freed in 2013 after President Vladimir Putin pardoned him.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Kremlin regime has learned the art of window dressing very well, but it\u2019s important to understand that behind these beautiful windows there is not just an ordinary authoritarian state but a real mafia, which has taken over this state,\u201d Khodorkovsky, 56, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIf we look at how these methods are applied in relation to the West, we will see corruption, blackmail, compromising materials and even violence. While negotiating with the current Russian regime the West should understand it\u2019s dealing with a criminal organization.\u201d\n\nRussia, which rejects his criticism as false, has issued an international arrest warrant for Khodorkovsky, accusing him of ordering at least one successful contract killing in the 1990s, something Khodorkovsky denies.\n\nPutin has said he regards the former businessman as a common thief, while Russian authorities have moved to curb the activities of Open Russia, a pro-democracy movement founded by Khodorkovsky.\n\n\u201cA VERY TALENTED KGB GUY\u201d\n\nIn \u201cCitizen K,\u201d Khodorkovsky says he misread Putin when the former Soviet intelligence officer first came to power.\n\n\u201cIt seemed to me ideologically that he was one of us. A person who gets it and wants to push Russia in the same direction that we want to. That is towards openness, towards democracy,\u201d said Khodorkovsky.\n\n\u201cBoy was I mistaken. He\u2019s a very talented KGB guy.\u201d\n\nDespite living in Britain, Khodorkovsky said he \u201clived for Russia\u201d and that it occupied his thoughts for 12 out of every 16 waking hours a day, adding that he and his supporters were acutely aware of the risks they ran.\n\n\u201cIf the Kremlin decides to kill somebody, it is very difficult for this person to avoid this fate,\u201d he said, a reference to allegations that Moscow has assassinated some of its critics abroad, a charge the Kremlin flatly rejects.\n\n\u201cI tell all my colleagues that the only thing we can do for you is to help you not to be forgotten, as I was not forgotten during 10 years in prison. But it will be difficult, or even impossible, to save you if anything happens.\u201d", "description": "Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky hopes a new documentary film about his life chronicling his journey from being Russia's richest man to an exiled dissident will open the West's eyes to the nature of modern Russia.", "authors": ["Hanna Rantala", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425395141&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8110E-OCAEN"}
