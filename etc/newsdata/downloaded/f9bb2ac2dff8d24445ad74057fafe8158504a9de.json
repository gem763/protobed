Carmel-based CNO Financial Group announced last year it wasn\u2019t renewing its the naming-rights contract that it held since the arena opened as Conseco Fieldhouse in 1999.\n\nTaylor tells the Indianapolis Business Journal that the Pacers want to reach a new sponsorship agreement before a $360 million arena renovation begins next summer. Taylor said several groups have expressed interest, but a deal couldn\u2019t be reached before the NBA\u2019s regular season began this past week.\n\nCNO Financial paid about $2 million a year for the naming rights.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Indianapolis Business Journal, http://www.ibj.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Indiana Pacers aren't yet taking the Bankers Life name off their arena even though the company's naming-rights deal expired in June.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
