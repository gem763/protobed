Old? Outdated? Just fine, but you want to trade it in anyway? September is usually the time when people start thinking about trading in their current iPhone and upgrading to a new device. Aside from financing or signing up through a carrier, the cheapest way to go about getting a good deal on a new iPhone is to trade in your old one.\n\nTrading in your iPhone is faster, easier, and safer than reselling. To get the best valuation for your iPhone, you\u2019ll want to follow these steps. Scratches, dents, and other imperfections may reduce what you get back, but, perfect or not, you\u2019re practically guaranteed to get at least something for your trade.\n\nInspect your phone\n\nOnce you\u2019ve cleaned up your iPhone, it\u2019s never a bad idea to take pictures of it before sending it in. Take note of the imperfections that you\u2019re aware of, and keep them handy in case you hear reports indicating further damage. Things can get damaged in the mail, and this could very well impact how much you earn for your trade, so it never hurts to keep a log of photos.\n\nErase your phone\n\nBefore you trade in your iPhone, you\u2019ll want to return it to factory default settings. Go into your iCloud settings, ensure that the Backup setting is switched on and that everything that you want to keep is backed up. This will allow you to restore all of your current info to a new iPhone. Alternatively, you can store a backup locally by manually initiating the process in iTunes on a macOS or Windows computer.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made a copy of your iPhone, turn off Find My iPhone, which is located within the iCloud settings. If you have an Apple Watch paired to the iPhone you want to trade in, unpair it within the Apple Watch app. As an added measure of protection, sign out of your Apple ID before wiping the phone. After this, wipe your iPhone by entering the \u201cGeneral\u201d settings option, followed by \u201cReset,\u201d then \u201cErase all content and settings.\u201d\n\nFind the best offer\n\nApple has announced some nice incentives for those who want to trade in their old iPhones for new as well as several retailers and carriers.\n\nWith new iPhone 11 Pro phones now starting at $999, as much credit as you can get will help offset the cost. So if you\u2019re thinking about upgrading, follow the guidelines above to help budget your new purchase this year.\n\nUpdate September 12th, 2019, 4:15PM ET: This article was originally published on September 11th, 2018, and it has been updated to reflect the new Apple iPhones.", "description": "Trading in your iPhone is faster, easier, and safer than reselling.
