It took six long years, but in a new GQ interview, the performer, producer, and songwriter says he has since realized the truth: Oh, right, this is America. The song was probably both.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get it at first,\u201d Williams said of the controversy around \u201cBlurred Lines.\u201d \u201cBecause there were older white women who, when that song came on, they would behave in some of the most surprising ways ever. And I would be like, \u2018Wow.\u2019 They would have me blushing. So when there started to be an issue with it, lyrically, I was, like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 There are women who really like the song and connect to the energy that just gets you up. And \u2018I know you want it\u2019 \u2014 women sing those kinds of lyrics all the time. So it\u2019s like, \u2018What\u2019s rape-y about that?\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, after some consideration, Pharrell says he began to understand why the song rubbed people the wrong way. \u201cI realized that there are men who use that same language when taking advantage of a woman, and it doesn\u2019t matter that that\u2019s not my behavior,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy mind opened up to what was actually being said in the song and how it could make someone feel. Even though it wasn\u2019t the majority, it didn\u2019t matter. I cared what they were feeling too. I realized that we live in a chauvinist culture in our country. Hadn\u2019t realized that. Didn\u2019t realize that some of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\u201d\n\nAnd if maturity and thoughtfulness and our greater cultural conversation around consent weren\u2019t enough to make Pharrell realize the power of pop music on society, his other huge 2013 hit, \u201cHappy,\u201d definitely brought the message home. \u201cIt literally made me cry,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, I was on the Oprah show for my birthday, and she showed me a video of people around the world singing that song, and that shit fucked me up. Bad. I was never the same. So I don\u2019t beat on my chest. I haven\u2019t been the same since any of that music.\u201d", "description": "Musician Pharrell Williams now sees why some found his hit song with Robin Thicke was offensive, as he has realized we live in a \u201cchauvinist culture.\u201d", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/14-Pharrell-Williams.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
