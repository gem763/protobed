Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to..\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ....an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn\u2019t, they....\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ....only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don\u2019t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?\n\nThe revelation of the planned talks \u2013 the existence of which are yet to be confirmed by the either the US state department or the Taliban \u2013 and their abrupt cancellation leave a question mark over the future of peace talks intended to bring American involvement in Afghanistan to an end, an early and regularly recited Trump campaign pledge.\n\nIt also emphasises just how much faith the US president puts on personal diplomacy, even with people previous heads of state would have avoided meeting for fear of granting them imprimatur \u2013 now apparently including members of a militant group the US government officially classifies as terrorists.\n\nAmerican negotiators have reached an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d with Taliban leaders over nine rounds of talks in Qatar aimed at facilitating the withdrawal of the roughly 13,000 US troops who remain in Afghanistan nearly 18 years since the military campaign commenced.\n\nThe Camp David talks would have been held three days short of the anniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks by al-Qaida militants who were being harboured in Afghanistan by the then-ruling Taliban regime, the justification for the US-led invasion of the country a few weeks later.\n\nMost of the terms of the provisional peace agreement are classified but it would include the withdrawal of 5,000 American soldiers from five bases across Afghanistan by early next year.\n\nThe Taliban would agree to renounce al-Qaida, fight the Islamic State group and stop jihadists from using the south Asian country as a safe haven.\n\nTrump campaigned for office promising to get the US \u201cout of the nation-building business\u201d but was persuaded by his advisers to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan in 2017. The surge failed to arrest the momentum of the resurgent Taliban, who now control more territory than at any time since their ouster in 2001.\n\nThe US president authorised the commencement of talks with the group last year in the hope of ending the US\u2019s ongoing military deployment in the country, which he described in July as \u201cridiculous\u201d.\n\nBloodletting has continued in the battered country despite the negotiations, including a car bomb blast on Thursday in Shash Darak, a fortified area near the green zone and home to important government headquarters including the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan intelligence service.\n\nThe death of the American soldier was at least the 16th of a US serviceperson in Afghanistan this year.\n\nThe Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter, saying a \u201cmartyrdom seeker\u201d \u2013 or suicide bomber \u2013 was responsible for the car bombing and that \u201cforeign invaders\u201d were killed.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s \u2018peace agreement\u2019 is a betrayal of Afghanistan and its people | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\nMore than 1,200 civilians have been killed so far this year in the country, most as a result of airstrikes by US warplanes including 89 children, according to figures by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) that the US government disputes.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement has been criticised by Afghanistan\u2019s internationally recognised president, Ashraf Ghani, whose government was excluded from the talks as a condition of the Taliban sitting down at the table.\n\nActivists have also said a US withdrawal would have dire implications for ordinary Afghans including women, who might be subject to extreme religious restrictions in a future Taliban-run or dominated national government.", "description": "President says he cancelled secret peace talks with insurgents and the Afghan president after Kabul attack killed 12 including US soldier", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b429d0fc03f23efcb94f8f034291fadd60155a/0_213_5508_3306/master/5508.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a576653ec4250d1f1b9a5f60b2db7309", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
