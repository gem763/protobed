Overall, it's just the idea that markets don't like uncertainty,\" he added.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> shed 0.06%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> of large, mid- and small companies rose 0.61%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 79.59 points, or 0.3%, to 26,891.12. The S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 7.25 points, or 0.24%, to 2,977.62 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 46.72 points, or 0.58%, to 8,030.66.\n\nFacebook Inc <FB.O> slipped 1.47% as a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of the social media company.\n\nThe dollar rose to a three-week high against a basket of currencies, helped by continued tightness in U.S. money markets, while heightened political tensions and a relatively dismal economic outlook weighed on the euro and sterling.\n\nIncreased political tensions on both sides of the Atlantic - the unfolding effort by U.S. congressional Democrats to impeach Trump and ongoing uncertainty regarding Britain's exit from the European Union - was likely to keep the greenback in demand, analysts said.\n\nThe dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.16%, with the euro <EUR=> down 0.2% to $1.0919. The Japanese yen <JPY=> weakened 0.06% versus the greenback at 107.86 per dollar.\n\nCrude oil prices pared losses late in the session after the U.S. Department of Defense said it would deploy radar systems, Patriot missiles and about 200 personnel to bolster Saudi Arabia's defenses after an attack on the kingdom's oil installations earlier this month.\n\nBrent crude <LCOc1> futures settled up 35 cents at $62.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures <CLc1> fell 8 cents to settle at $56.41 a barrel.\n\nU.S. gold futures <GCcv1> settled up 0.2% at $1,515.20.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Dan Grebler)", "description": "U.S. stocks and government debt yields fell on Thursday after the release of a whistleblower complaint that accused President Donald Trump of pressing Ukraine to investigate one of his main political rivals in next year's U.S. presidential election.
