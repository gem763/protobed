They also work on private home projects all over the world, including the Alps and Ibiza, where they often act more as interior architects and development partners with other companies, Mr. Mozzi said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are the architect, developer and interior designer, so nothing falls between the gaps. By taking ownership of the project you have a more holistic approach,\u201d he said.\n\nMore: Why a Miami Developer Says Now\u2019s the Time for \u2018Hopping on a Plane\u2019 and Starting to Shop\n\nAmong their recent London projects is a 19th-century London beer bottling factory transformed into seven luxury duplex apartments, collectively dubbed the Richmond Brewery Stores, and 13-19 Leinster Square, a row of 19th-century townhouses\u2014that later served as a three-star hotel\u2014and now comprises 15 high-end homes.\n\n\n\nAnd while he\u2019s become well known in real estate circles in London, Mr. Mozzi, 35, also recently made headlines for his personal life\u2014in September, it was announced that he and England\u2019s Princess Beatrice of York are engaged.\n\n\n\nWe caught up with Mr. Mozzi to discuss the importance of flow in a home, why he pays attention to the details (like phone-charging stations) and more.\n\nMore: Architect Ricardo \u00c1lvarez-D\u00edaz Is All About Sustainability and Resiliency\n\nMansion Global: How would you describe your dream property.\n\nEdo Mapelli Mozzi: We always design homes that buyers want to live in, not just invest in. We\u2019re always thinking about things like, \u201cWill there be storage?\u201d \u201cWhere are they going to plug in their phones?\u201d\n\n\n\nI like a large, usable space that\u2019s logical. It\u2019s wonderful when the master bedroom, kitchen, living and dining room face onto a garden square, as they do at Leinster Square.\n\n\n\nYou want a logical flow. You don\u2019t want, for example, a master bedroom that shares a wall with another bedroom. You want every bedroom to have a guest water closet, and an adequate-sized utility room.\n\n\n\nWe do private projects for people all over the world, and we often do heritage buildings and make them modern. We\u2019ll keep a facade that\u2019s listed, but now it\u2019s got new air conditioning, modern heating. And I love the mixture of old and new. You don\u2019t want a home to feel like a show home. And you can mix that old and new with photography, paintings and furniture.\n\nFrom Penta: Mark Rothko\u2019s \u2018Blue Over Red\u2019 Could Top $25 Million\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nEMM: Time is a luxury, and so is human contact, and quality time with the people you care about is important. For us, it\u2019s about creating space for that interaction to happen. We don\u2019t have big plasma TVs everywhere, because we want to create connections.\n\n\n\nAnother important element of luxury is the story behind a property. It\u2019s about the authenticity.\n\n\n\nWhy is a piece of art worth so much? Because of the story of the artist, and the authenticity of the piece. In our projects, we\u2019ve hand-chosen the marble from the quarries, we\u2019ve transported it, with thousands of people involved. We\u2019ve chosen the trees that become the floors. Once you know the background of those individual elements, you know it\u2019s luxury.\n\n\n\nMany new developments are white boxes with nice amenities. We\u2019ve tried to make our interiors very high level\u2014we want the marble in the bathrooms and the kitchens to shine through.\n\nMore: Compass\u2019s \u2018Chief Evangelist\u2019 on the Importance of a Home\u2019s Context\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most important amenity to have in a home right now?\n\nEMM: We\u2019ve moved away from very expensive gyms and members clubs. The concierge is still there, though, because people want the security. People are still going to work every day and want their dogs walked, and their packages picked up. Having a gym in the basement or a swimming pool, or a wine club\u2014all these tools that developers have used that act as an attraction to people buying off plan\u2014 are not used, and they just add to service charges.\n\n\n\nI always see people in my gym who have gyms in their building. People don\u2019t want to go to a dining space in the basement, they want to go to the cool, new restaurant around the corner. And they want to keep their service charges lower.\n\n\n\nWe do have some private gardens, and what those do is create a community. Inside the garden there are events that happen.\n\n\n\nBut people also want proximity to the big parks, like Hyde Park.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve also seen a lot of simplicity when it comes to home automation and air conditioning and heating. The interface needs to be simple.\n\nMore: Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Executive Says Customizing a Home is Key\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nEMM: London is quite affordable for the international community, due to taxes, and the political uncertainty. The dollar-to-sterling conversion offers another 25% discount. What I always say is to look to the established locations. If you go to these \u201cbrand new\u201d areas where there are 3,000 yo 5,000 new units being introduced at a time, they\u2019re going to be quite expensive, and they don\u2019t have that basic infrastructure yet\u2014 the parks, gardens, good transport, good schools.\n\nWe focus on Notting Hill, Chelsea and Battersea.\n\nYou\u2019ve also got to know that you can sell a home before you buy it, so your life doesn\u2019t get held up because you can\u2019t sell your home.\n\nMore: Design Firm Chief Says Luxury is About Tapping Into All the Senses\n\nMG: What\u2019s the biggest surprise in the luxury real estate market right now?\n\nEMM: There\u2019s still a reasonable amount of activity, but I guess it\u2019s the high-net-worth investors who are seeing the opportunities to get in. The last six months have really been a buyer\u2019s market, and I\u2019ve been surprised by a lot of interest. We recently finished a scheme in Chelsea, and we sold out in six months. Buyers have great choices.\n\nAlso, people are saying, \u201cI have 5 million pounds, why don\u2019t you show me what\u2019s available.\u201d People are more open to explore how far that money will go anywhere.\n\nTransactions are down, though, because British buyers are in chains. They can\u2019t sell, so they can\u2019t buy. Those transactions are much slower.\n\nBut the overseas buyers love London.We\u2019ve certainly got people who\u2019ve lived in Hong Kong who are coming here. People come back to England for the schools.\n\nMore: Luxury is About Inner Wellness, Says Los Angeles-Based Designer\n\nMG: What\u2019s your best piece of real estate advice?\n\nEMM: Make sure you buy something that stands the test of time. Get a good buying agent. Really understand the developer, the project and what\u2019s going on behind the walls.\n\nThere are so many more buying agents in London now, and you need to have the right quality of advisors.\n\nAnd you need to think about how your lifestyle might change in five-to-10 years. Transaction costs in London are about 10%, so you need to have plans in place.\n\nClick to Read More Luxury Real Estate Professionals Share Their Insights\n\n\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-120352?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
