The plane, a Boeing 737-800, had lavatories in the front and back for the passengers and crew, according to court documents.\n\nAccording to the complaint, about two-and-a-half hours into the flight, Mr Graham asked for a flight attendant to come to the cockpit as he went to the lavatory. Southwest protocol requires that two crew members be in the cockpit at all times.\n\nMs Steinaker entered the cockpit, noticed an iPad mounted to the windshield next to the captain\u2019s seat and saw what appeared to be a live-streaming video of Mr Graham in the lavatory, according to the complaint.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He told Ms Steinaker cameras were a top-secret security measure that had been installed in the lavatories in all the airline\u2019s 737-800 planes, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nMr Russell then instructed Ms Steinaker not to tell anyone about the camera, which he said was hidden so no one could find it. Ms Steinaker then used her phone to take a picture of the iPad, which showed Mr Graham in the lavatory at the time, according to the complaint.\n\nWhen the captain came back to the cockpit, Mr Russell left to use the lavatory. Finding herself alone with Mr Graham, Ms Steinaker confronted him about the cameras, but he refused to respond and blocked her view of the iPad, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nMs Steinaker told the other flight attendants what had happened and showed them the picture she had taken of the iPad. When the plane landed in Phoenix, the two pilots immediately disembarked, in violation of airline protocol, according to the complaint.\n\nIn his quick departure, Mr Graham, a federal flight deck officer, left a loaded firearm unattended in the cockpit, the lawsuit alleges, in violation of Federal Aviation Administration regulations.\n\nUpon landing, Ms Steinaker and other crew members filed a written incident report to Southwest and requested that the airline seize the iPad and save the cockpit voice recording. It is unclear whether the airline complied, Mr Goldman said.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the airline told Ms Steinaker it would investigate the incident and a supervisor warned her: \u201cIf this got out, if this went public, no one \u2014 I mean no one \u2014 would ever fly our airline again.\"\n\nMr Graham and Mr Russell later departed Phoenix for Nashville on time with a new crew of flight attendants. To Mr Goldman\u2019s knowledge, both are still employed as pilots.\n\n\u201cOnly a pervert would think this is funny,\u201d Mr Goldman said. \u201cA cockpit is not a playground for peeping Toms.\u201d\n\nSince the incident two years ago, Ms Steinaker and her husband David Steinaker, a fellow Southwest flight attendant, have faced retaliation from the airline, Mr Goldman said. Both have worked as flight attendants for decades with \u201cexemplary\u201d track records, but now they are repeatedly checked at the gate, interrogated and drug tested, he added.\n\nMr Goldman said the episode was outrageous and scarred Ms Steinaker, causing her considerable emotional distress.\n\n\u201cThis was not just a passing event,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was something that violated her workplace, her sense of safety and security, and really caused her to have a fear that she could be paired with people like this again, and the airline wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "When a Southwest Airlines flight attendant entered the cockpit during a flight and saw an iPad showing what appeared to be live footage from the plane\u2019s lavatory, one of the pilots assured her it was a \u201ctop secret security measure,\u201d according to court documents.
