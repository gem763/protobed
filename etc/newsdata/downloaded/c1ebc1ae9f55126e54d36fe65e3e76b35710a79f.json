They say markets often climb a wall of worry, and there is a wall of worry. At some point those worries \u2014 such as the Fed being tired on rate cuts and trade tensions \u2014 then investors will shift their paradigm and become more cautious.\u201d\n\nOthers on Wall Street share Ball\u2019s reservation on the now red-hot markets.\n\n\u201cNone of these moves [in the market] can be seen as anything but a bounce from oversold conditions\u2026and we\u2019re going to have to see more upside follow-through before one could say with any real confidence that these moves are anything more than technical ones,\u201d says Miller Tabak chief strategist Matt Maley. \u201cTherefore, despite all the hoopla around the new high in the S&P 500 yesterday, nobody can realistically make ANY definitive conclusions from the recent action in any of the markets.\u201d\n\nIf Ball\u2019s call were to happen \u2014 a big if when compared against a market ripping higher to new records this month \u2014 it would represent about a 20% haircut from current levels. Something along the lines of the Federal Reserve signaling at one of its two remaining meetings this year it\u2019s done cutting interest rates would have to occur to truly spook the bulls. Or, the market grows completely impatient with the Trump administration\u2019s timeline on delivering phase two of its trade deal with China.\n\n(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) More\n\nOr hey, the president gets impeached \u2014 that\u2019s a factor not priced into the markets at all and largely ignored as a risk by many Wall Street pros Yahoo Finance has chatted up. So, as Ball correctly points out, there are logical catalysts out there that could nail stocks.\n\nBut until then, the market could very well stay on autopilot into 2020.\n\nThe S&P 500 is enjoying a record-setting week, spurred by hopes for another interest rate cut from the Fed this week and a spate of better than expected third quarter earnings reports. Year-to-date, the Nasdaq Composite is up roughly 24%, the S&P 500 has gained 21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) has tacked on 16%.\n\n\u201cI am not sure we go all the way down to S&P 500 2,500. We continue to see the trend move higher \u2014 3,500 and 2,500 seem like extremes to me. I do think we will trend higher, and we do not see a recession coming,\u201d thinks Crossmark Global Investments chief markets strategist Victoria Fernandez.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
