Getty\n\n\u201cI think Ole has a young, energetic team, and I think Jesse\u2019s pressing and the energy he brings to that has been an important part of what they\u2019ve tried to do in the first few games.\n\n\u201cThe inclusion of Jesse for us is partly because his form for us has always been good.\n\n\u201cI know there was stats on his goals. He was only involved in four games for us last season because of injury \u2013 two starts and two off the bench.\n\n\u201cHe scored two and had a goal disallowed when he came on in the Nations League game. He had a very good World Cup.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re selecting a team, there\u2019s half an eye on club form but also I don\u2019t remember a game where he\u2019s been really poor for us.\n\n\u201cHe has different attributes. I think for him and for everybody else, there is serious competition and if they aren\u2019t scoring for us or they aren\u2019t scoring for their clubs, that can make things more difficult.\n\n\u201cBut, equally, I think it\u2019s good that we support him at this moment, in that you could argue club-wise, he\u2019s on the fringes and whether he should be ahead of others.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think there are too many that we haven\u2019t included that should be ahead of him, and his performance for us has been very, very good.\u201d\n\nIt would not be the first time Southgate has selected a player low in form or minutes in an attempt to boost their confidence and show his belief.\n\nBut Lingard does not have to look far to see how the England manager is willing to make striking changes to his squad.\n\nThere are plenty of youngsters pushing into the team right now and Southgate is having to balance the desire for progress with preparing for a tilt at Euro 2020.\n\n\u201cI think there are a few positions that if you played tomorrow, you\u2019d know who the number one was,\u201d Southgate said.\n\n\u201cAnd there are other positions where that\u2019s a little bit less clear.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d said to me in September of the World Cup year that (Harry) Maguire was going to be the standout centre-back, we would\u2019ve said \u2018we like him but we\u2019re not certain on that\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo, that can change as the year goes on. Form fluctuates, and when we got to March, we thought Ox [Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain] was probably going to be regular in the team, then we lost him.\n\n\u201cOne of the downfalls, I think, when I was a player was that we\u2019d lose a key player and it\u2019d be a disaster and there was no replacement and (there\u2019d be) huge negativity.\n\n\u201cI think the good thing is, if we lost... there are some players you\u2019d rather not lose, but I think we could adapt to anything and that\u2019s really important.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0manager Gareth Southgate has defended his selection of Jesse Lingard, stressing the importance of supporting the out-of-form Manchester United attacking midfielder.
