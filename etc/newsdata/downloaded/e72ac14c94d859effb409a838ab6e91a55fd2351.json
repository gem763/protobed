REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nIn Hong Kong\u2019s demonstrations, millions have taken to the streets in sometimes violent clashes over what they see as China\u2019s tightening grip. Most protesters in the former British colony want greater democracy, among other demands, although a small minority is calling for independence.\n\nIn that sense, they share some common ground with separatist demonstrators in Spain\u2019s wealthy northeast region of Catalonia, which was rocked by protests after nine separatist leaders were sentenced this month to long prison terms for a failed independence bid in 2017.\n\nThursday\u2019s rally in Hong Kong was held in a downtown garden, home to a cricket club in colonial days, one of the few to have obtained a permit from authorities in recent weeks. The organizers said 3,000 protesters took part. Police put the number at 550.\n\nSome Hong Kong protesters went online to urge people not to attend, saying it was too provocative and risked denting international support for their own cause.\n\nThere was a small demonstration on Thursday in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters outside the Chinese Consulate-General in Barcelona, which La Vanguardia newspaper said attracted more than 100 people.\n\nMost banners at the Hong Kong rally called for Catalan freedom or denounced perceived police brutality in clashes with Hong Kong protesters over five months of unrest. But there were a couple of large flags calling for Hong Kong\u2019s independence and a brief, muted chant along the same lines. That is a red line for the Communist Party rulers in Beijing.\n\nHong Kong authorities formally banned a group promoting independence from China in September last year, the first time a political organization has been outlawed since the 1997 handover to Chinese rule.\n\nIn Spain, all but one of the main political parties have consistently opposed an independence referendum for Catalonia, but separatist parties are not banned and the region already enjoys a degree of political autonomy and control over part of its budget.\n\nRicard Bosom, 36, a tourist from Barcelona, said he supported the Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\u201cThe context (of Catalonia and Hong Kong) is different,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cBoth are different stories, but in general terms... it is about an oppressive and tyrannical state against a group of people that are trying to do something different and they are not listened to.\u201d\n\nIn 1997 Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, including an independent judiciary and right to protest.\n\nBut many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as a relentless march toward mainland control.\n\n\u201cI come because I think Catalonia needs support, just like Hong Kong,\u201d said Jason Chan, 22, a clerk. \u201cPursuing democracy is a universal value.\u201d\n\nChina denies meddling in Hong Kong and accuses the United States and Britain of fomenting the unrest, the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nHe warned this month that any attempt to divide China would end in \u201ccrushed bodies and shattered bones\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nIndependence is a highly divisive issue in Catalonia, a region of more than 7 million inhabitants that has its own language, parliament and flag.\n\nProtests erupted in the region after the separatist leaders were sentenced on Oct. 14 over the 2017 independence bid, which included holding a referendum that had been banned by the courts and then making a unilateral declaration of independence.\n\nStudents have boycotted classes and protesters have focused on strategic targets to cause maximum disruption, including the airport serving Barcelona - similar to strategies used by Hong Kong activists.", "description": "Hundreds of Hong Kong protesters, some waving Catalan flags and banners urging \"a fight for freedom together\", rallied in support of a separate Catalonia on Thursday, broaching an issue that is anathema to Hong Kong's rulers in Beijing.", "authors": ["John Geddie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444509140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N17H", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
