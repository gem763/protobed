The fight doubles as the final of the welterweight grand prix tournament, and the winner will get a $1 million bonus.\n\nLima weighed in first and was 169.25 pounds. MacDonald came later in the weigh-ins window and was 169.25, as well, to make their fight official.\n\nBut one main card fight had to be canceled. Robin van Roosmalen (2-0 MMA, 0-0 BMMA) came in nearly 10 pounds overweight for his featherweight fight against Cris Lencioni (5-2 MMA, 2-2 BMMA). Van Roosmalen was 155.25 pounds, even with use of a towel. Lencioni weighed in early in the window and was 145.25.\n\nAfter van Roosmalen missed weight, commission head Mike Mazzulli told him because his weight still was within 10 pounds of his opponent, he would OK the fight to happen \u2013 but only if Lencioni and Bellator approved it. He also told van Roosmalen that he would file a note with the Association of Boxing Commissions to require him to fight at lightweight moving forward.\n\nWhen Lencioni met with Bellator officials, he initially declined to take the fight with van Roosmalen at the higher weight. So that bout, scheduled to open the main card, has been canceled. A Bellator official told MMA Junkie the prelim fight between Kevin Ferguson Jr. and Craig Campbell will move to the main card.\n\nAnd main card fighter Isaiah Chapman (9-3 MMA, 0-0 BMMA) was a quarter-pound over for his bantamweight fight against Patrick Mix (11-0 MMA, 1-0 BMMA). Chapman was fined 20 percent of his purse, which goes to Mix.\n\nThe early weigh-ins took place at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., and precede the ceremonial weigh-ins for the fans, which take place at 12:30 p.m. ET at the same venue.\n\nBellator 232 takes place Saturday at Mohegan Sun Arena. The main card streams on DAZN following prelims on MMA Junkie.\n\nThe full Bellator 232 weigh-in results included:\n\nMAIN CARD (DAZN, 10 p.m. ET)\n\nChamp Rory MacDonald (169.25) vs. Douglas Lima (169.25) \u2013 for welterweight title, welterweight tournament final\n\nSaad Awad (173) vs. Paul Daley (174.75) \u2013 175-pound catchweight\n\nIsaiah Chapman (136.25)* vs. Patrick Mix (136)\n\nManny Muro (160) vs. Nick Newell (159.75) \u2013 160-pound catchweight\n\nCris Lencioni (145.25) vs. Robin van Roosmalen (155.25)**\n\nPRELIMINARY CARD (MMA Junkie, 6:45 p.m. ET)\n\nRyan Hardy Evans (170) vs. Demetrios Plaza (170)\n\nCraig Campbell (158) vs. Kevin Ferguson Jr. (160) \u2013 160-pound catchweight\n\nLance Gibson Jr. (155) vs. Dominic Jones (154.25)\n\nDevin Powell (155.25) vs. Marcus Surin (155)\n\nDan Cormier (125.5) vs. John Lopez (124)\n\nJohn Douma (135) vs. Jornel Lugo (136)\n\nZarrukh Adashev (125.5) vs. Tevin Dyce (125.25)\n\n*Chapman was a quarter-pound over the bantamweight limit and fined 20 percent of his purse, which goes to Mix.\n\n**Van Roosmalen missed the featherweight limit by more than 9 pounds. Commission head Mike Mazzulli told MMA Junkie Van Roosmalen will be required to fight at lightweight moving forward. Lencioni declined to take the fight at a catchweight, so that bout is canceled.
