In South Africa, hundreds of Nigerian workers have been airlifted home as anti-migrant violence spirals out of control.\n\nTwo different events in two different countries, but each a glimpse of the malevolent trends transforming politics globally. While neither event has received much attention in Britain, consumed as we are by all things Brexit, both throw light upon developments here, too.\n\nAssam\u2019s new detention centres are supposed to hold some of the 1.9 million people who last week were removed from the state\u2019s updated version of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). It is the latest move by Assamese nationalists to deprive Muslims of citizenship and to declare them \u201cillegal\u201d.\n\nMore than a third of Assam\u2019s population is Muslim, some of whose roots in the area go back centuries. They are as Indian as the prime minister, Narendra Modi. In the eyes of Hindu and Assamese nationalists, however, all Muslims are \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and \u201cBangladeshis\u201d. After the Bangladesh war of independence in 1971, when the old East Pakistan became an independent nation, thousands of refugees fled to India, providing a new source of Assamese grievance.\n\nModi\u2019s Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, which controls the local state as well as the national government, has stoked that grievance and used the new citizenship register as a means to ethnically purge Assamese Muslims.\n\nTo be recognised as an Indian citizen in Assam, an individual must possess documentary evidence of their family having lived in the state, or having been Indian citizens, since before 25 March 1971, the day Bangladesh\u2019s liberation war began. Many poor farmers and itinerant workers do not have paperwork to prove that they are citizens of the country in which they were born. The NRC is, in the words of one critical report, a process of \u201cmaking foreigners\u201d out of citizens.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nigerians arrive in Lagos after being send back from South Africa on 11 September.

What is certain is that the ugliness of nativist politics in India still has a long way to play out. While Indian authorities have been declaring their own citizens \u201cforeigners\u201d, in South Africa, foreigners, mainly migrants from other African nations, have faced a wave of violence that has left at least 12 dead. It is the latest eruption of the xenophobic rage that has scarred South Africa.\n\nSouth Africa is the most unequal nation in the world. A quarter of the population live in extreme poverty. The true unemployment rate may be close to 40%. There is widespread anger that a quarter of a century after the end of apartheid the material conditions of most blacks have barely improved.\n\nMigrants make a convenient scapegoat for beleaguered politicians. Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa \u201ccondemned violence against foreign nationals\u201d. Six months ago, he blamed migrants for South Africa\u2019s social problems. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule has painted foreigners as criminals. Opposition parties condemn the ANC for allowing migrants to \u201cflood\u201d in.\n\nIn fact, migrants neither steal jobs nor are disproportionately involved in crime. But facts matter little to unscrupulous politicians.\n\nThe events in India and South Africa are products of the specific circumstances of each country. Both also expose trends across the world in which notions of national belonging are becoming more constricted, minority groups increasingly targeted and immigrants bearing the blame for failures of policy and leadership.\n\nThese events are but more extreme versions of trends visible in Europe and America. Here, too, false claims that immigrants \u201csteal our jobs\u201d or are \u201cresponsible for most crimes\u201d echo loudly. At the heart of Britain\u2019s Windrush scandal was a \u201chostile environment\u201d policy under which British citizens of the wrong skin colour were denied their rights because they were deemed to have insufficient documentation.\n\nWhether in India, South Africa or Europe, the question asked is always: \u201cWhat is the impact of immigration?\u201d The answers given are usually false. The question almost never asked is: \u201cWhat is the impact of anti-migrant hostility?\u201d The answer is that it is deeply damaging and not just to migrants and minority groups. Anti-immigrant panics help erode the liberties of all citizens and obscure the real grievances that people face.\n\nAs the South African journalist Shaazia Ebrahim has observed: \u201cThe truth is that when the violence subsides, we\u2019ll be left with the bare bones of reality: a failing government with a leadership vacuum and non-existent jobs in a motionless economy.\u201d It\u2019s not just South Africans who have to face up to that truth.\n\n\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist", "description": "Politicians fan the flames to hide their own failures and erode the liberties of all", "authors": ["Kenan Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62168e67d6cb855182124b7c31e8949d4056c749/0_254_4872_2923/master/4872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2652254a139a288aeaafb6ad5eb85657", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
