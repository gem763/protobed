(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Trump is so eager to complete hundreds of miles of border fence ahead of the 2020 presidential election that he has directed aides to fast-track billions of dollars\u2019 worth of construction contracts, aggressively seize private land and disregard environmental rules, according to current and former officials involved with the project.\n\nHe also has told worried subordinates that he will pardon them of any potential wrongdoing should they have to break laws to get the barriers built quickly, those officials said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to complete 500 miles of fencing by the time voters go to the polls in November 2020, stirring chants of \u201cFinish the Wall!\u201d at his political rallies as he pushes for tighter border controls. But the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed just about 60 miles of \u201creplacement\u201d barrier during the first 2\u00bd years of Trump\u2019s presidency, all of it in areas that previously had border infrastructure.\n\n[\u2018He always brings them up\u2019: Trump tries to steer border wall deal to North Dakota firm]\n\nThe president has told senior aides that a failure to deliver on the signature promise of his 2016 campaign would be a letdown to his supporters and an embarrassing defeat. With the election 14 months away and hundreds of miles of fencing plans still in blueprint form, Trump has held regular White House meetings for progress updates and to hasten the pace, according to several people involved in the discussions.\n\nWhen aides have suggested that some orders are illegal or unworkable, Trump has suggested he would pardon the officials if they would just go ahead, aides said. He has waved off worries about contracting procedures and the use of eminent domain, saying \u201ctake the land,\u201d according to officials who attended the meetings.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pardon you,\u201d he has told officials in meetings about the wall.\n\n\u201cHe said people expected him to build a wall, and it had to be done by the election,\u201d one former official said.\n\nAsked for comment, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Trump is joking when he makes such statements about pardons.\n\n[Paint it black: Nick Miroff talks President Trump\u2019s latest border wall plan on Post Reports]\n\nDeputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said Tuesday that the president is protecting the country with the addition of new border barriers.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump promised to secure our border with sane, rational immigration policies to make American communities safer, and that\u2019s happening everywhere the wall is being built,\u201d Gidley said. He called internal criticisms of the president \u201cjust more fabrications by people who hate the fact the status quo, that has crippled this country for decades, is finally changing as President Trump is moving quicker than anyone in history to build the wall, secure the border and enact the very immigration policies the American people voted for.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is fighting aggressively for the American people where other leaders in the past have rolled over, sold out, and done absolutely nothing,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nA U.S. Border Patrol agent stands Aug. 23 in Calexico, Calif., next to a stretch of fence on the U.S.-Mexico border that is to be replaced.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper is expected to approve a White House request to divert $3.6 billion in Pentagon funds to the barrier project in coming weeks, money that Trump sought after lawmakers refused to allocate $5 billion. The funds will be pulled from Defense Department projects in 26 states, according to administration officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the matter.\n\n[Trump administration will divert disaster relief funds to U.S.-Mexico border]\n\nTrump\u2019s determination to build the barriers as quickly as possible has not diminished his interest in the aesthetic aspects of the project, particularly the requirement that the looming steel barriers be painted black and topped with sharpened tips.\n\nIn a meeting at the White House on May 23, Trump ordered the Army Corps and the Department of Homeland Security to paint the structure black, according to internal communications reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\nAdministration officials have stopped trying to talk him out of the demands, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing to instruct contractors to apply black paint or coating to all new barrier fencing, the communications show.\n\nTrump conceded last year in an immigration meeting with lawmakers that a wall or barrier is not the most effective mechanism to curb illegal immigration, recognizing it would accomplish less than a major expansion of U.S. enforcement powers and deportation authority. But he told lawmakers that his supporters want a wall and that he has to deliver it.\n\n[This photo shows why a border wall won\u2019t stop the immigration surge]\n\nTrump talked about the loud cheers the wall brought at rallies, according to one person with direct knowledge of the meeting.\n\nFormer White House chief of staff John F. Kelly would often tell administration officials to disregard the president\u2019s demands if Kelly did not think they were feasible or legally sound, according to current and former aides.\n\n\n\nReplacement of existing barriers is underway on the U.S. border with Mexico on Aug. 23 near Calexico. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring a conference call last week, officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Army Corps engineers that the hundreds of miles of fencing must be completed before the next presidential election, according to administration officials with knowledge of the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.\n\n\u201cBorder Patrol insists on compressed acquisition timelines, and we consent. Their goal is to get contracts awarded, not for us to get a quality contract with a thoroughly vetted contractor,\u201d said one senior official who is concerned the agency has been hurried to hand out contracts as quickly as possible.\n\nMilitary officials expect more contract protests because the arrangements have been rushed, the official added. The Army Corps already has had to take corrective actions for two procurement contracts, after companies protested.\n\nThe companies building the fencing and access roads have been taking heavy earth-moving equipment into environmentally sensitive border areas adjacent to U.S. national parks and wildlife preserves, but the administration has waived procedural safeguards and impact studies, citing national security concerns.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care how much money is spent, whether landowners\u2019 rights are violated, whether the environment is damaged, the law, the regs or even prudent business practices,\u201d the senior official said.\n\nCBP has suggested no longer writing risk-assessment memos \u201crelated to the fact that we don\u2019t have real estate rights and how this will impact construction,\u201d the official said.\n\nWhile Trump has insisted that the barriers be painted, the cost of painting them will reduce the length of the fence the government will be able to build. According to the internal analysis, painting or coating 175 miles of barriers \u201cwill add between $70 million and $133 million in cost,\u201d trimming the amount of fencing the Army Corps will be able to install by four to seven miles.\n\n\n\nSections of barrier being installed on the U.S.-Mexico border near Calexico.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nIn June, teams of U.S. soldiers painted a one-mile section of fence in Calexico, Calif., at a cost of $1 million. The coating, known as \u201cmatte black\u201d or \u201cflat black,\u201d absorbs heat, making the fence hot to the touch, more slippery and therefore tougher to climb, according to border agents.\n\nAt Trump\u2019s behest, the Army Corps also is preparing to instruct contractors to remove from the upper part of the fence the smooth metal plates that are used to thwart climbers. The president considered that design feature unsightly, according to officials familiar with his directives.\n\nInstead, contractors have been asked to cut the tips of the steel bollards to a sharpened point. Trump had told aides this spring he thought the barrier should be spiked to instill a fear of injury.\n\nThe change in the bollard design is likely to reduce the overall length of the barrier by two to three miles, according to the administration\u2019s cost assessments.\n\nCBP has used a pointed design in the past, according to agency officials, either by installing a pyramid-shaped cap or making what the agency refers to as a \u201cmiter cut\u201d in the metal.\n\nTrump remains keen to tout incremental progress toward his wall-building commitments, and in recent weeks, top Homeland Security officials have taken to Twitter to promote the advances.\n\n\n\nPeople walk on the Tijuana, Mexico, side of the border near the primary fence that separates the United States and Mexico in the San Diego Sector on Aug. 22. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nIn recent days, DHS leaders including acting CBP chief Mark Morgan and the top official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, have tweeted photos of border fence construction, echoing promises that 450 miles of new barrier will be completed by next year. Another senior administration official credited both men with injecting urgency, saying that \u201cthings are starting to crank away,\u201d even though Cuccinelli\u2019s agency is not involved in the project.\n\nDan Scavino Jr., the White House social media director, has asked for video footage and photos of equipment digging up the desert and planting the barriers so that administration officials can tweet about it, aides said.\n\nAdministration officials involved in the project also defended the president\u2019s use of eminent domain laws to speed the process.\n\n\u201cThere is no more constitutionally permissible public purpose for eminent domain than national defense,\u201d said a current administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record about the contracting process.\n\n\u201cOur intention is to negotiate with every property owner, and every property owner will receive fair market value for the land,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut the land that is needed is not replaceable land. This is not like building a hospital or even a school. There is no alternative land to the border.\u201d\n\nCBP and Pentagon officials insist they remain on track to complete about 450 miles of fencing by the election. Of that, about 110 miles will be added to areas where there is currently no barrier. The height of the structure will vary between 18 and 30 feet, high enough to inflict severe injury or death from a fall.\n\nThe Border Patrol\u2019s strategic planning and analysis office has not made a final decision on the black paint or other White House design requests .\n\n\u201cUltimately, we\u2019ll do our assessment and determine what is the best for us operationally,\u201d said Brian Martin, the office\u2019s chief, adding that the agency is waiting to get border agents\u2019 feedback on whether the coating would be beneficial.\n\nMartin also said CBP would continue to install anti-climb panels on portions of the barrier already under contract, calling the design \u201cvery vital to overall effectiveness.\u201d But he and other CBP officials said that some new portions of barriers will have the panels and that others will not, a determination that he said will be guided by necessity, not aesthetics.\n\nEach time President Trump turned down money for his wall, he ended up with less money than he started with. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nTrump has recently urged the Army Corps to award a contract to a company he favors, North Dakota-based Fisher Industries, though the firm has not been selected. Fisher has been aggressively pushed by Trump ally Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who briefly held up the confirmation of a Trump budget office nominee last month in an attempt to put pressure on the Army Corps.\n\nCramer demanded to see the contracts awarded to Fisher\u2019s competitors, lashing out at the \u201carrogance\u201d of the Army Corps in emails to military officials after he was told the bidding process involved proprietary information that could not be shared. The CEO of Fisher Industries is a major backer of Cramer and has donated to his campaigns.\n\n[These photos show private border barriers being built on private land]\n\nCramer visited the El Paso area Tuesday to tour border facilities and view a span of privately funded border fencing Fisher built as a showcase for what it claims are superior construction techniques. Cramer posted videos of his tour to social media. He undertook the tour \u201cto see the crisis at our border firsthand.\u201d\n\nThe senator had asked Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commander of the Army Corps, to meet him at the site, but Semonite is traveling in Brazil, where the Trump administration has offered to help fight wildfires in the Amazon.\n\nIn an email to The Post, Cramer said he met with CEO Tommy Fisher on Tuesday at a span of fencing the company built on private land; he said Army Corps officials joined them at the site.\n\n\u201cThe agents on the ground said the walls have been very helpful in slowing illegal crossings,\u201d Cramer wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not a wall-building expert, but at the pace of the last few years, it\u2019s hard to see how 450 miles gets built with the same process. . . . I wish DHS would engage a whole bunch of builders and innovators rather than rely on the same decades old bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nCramer said he shared the president\u2019s \u201cfrustration\u201d with the pace of progress.\n\nSeveral administration officials who confirmed the White House\u2019s urgency said they expect to be able to deliver on Trump\u2019s demands because the actual construction of the barriers is typically the last step in the process.\n\n\u201cThere is a long lead time to acquiring land, getting permits and identifying funding,\u201d the official said. \u201cI think you will see a dramatic increase in wall construction next year because all of the work over the past two years has primed the pump.\u201d", "description": "The White House is making an all-out push to get hundreds of miles of border barriers built before November 2020, largely to fulfill Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Nick Miroff Covers Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security For The Washington Post.
