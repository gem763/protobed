(Image: DC Comics)\n\nHarley Quinn might actually be the most wanted woman in comics. Her animated series premieres November 30 in the U.S. on DC Universe, she\u2019s got a film coming out next year, and she\u2019s about to have yet another comic book on shelves.\n\nAnnounced Friday, Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey, from husband and wife duo Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti, is slated to release next year under DC\u2019s Black Label \u2014 and we got a chance to speak with Conner about the project. She calls the story a continuation of the pair\u2019s 2013 run with the character, and she\u2019s bringing back Harley\u2019s old buddies from Brooklyn. Yes, that means Poison Ivy.\n\nThe Joker\u2019s back too. That\u2019s what\u2019ll bring Harley to join forces with Black Canary, Huntress and Batgirl to take down the host of new baddies that are sure to come with the steep $10,000,000 bounty that Joker\u2019s put on her head.\n\nThe full cover of Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey. (Illustration: DC Comics)\n\nConner teases Harley will vex Renee the most, but will be vexed by Cass the most. \u201cThat\u2019s how I see it going,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new set of characters for her to drive nuts.\u201d\n\nAnd perhaps one of those characters Harley will drive nuts is Conner herself. \u201cI have her voice in my head and it\u2019s really dug in like a tick. I don\u2019t know if that makes me crazy because I have her voice in my head so clearly.\u201d\n\nA lot has changed since Conner and Palmiotti last had a turn with the Clown Princess. Harley went from a character once defined by wanting to be wanted by the Joker, to a character who can\u2019t seem to get enough of herself.\n\n\u201cHer time has come,\u201d Conner told us. \u201cFor so long she had been a sidekick, a henchperson, a secondary character. It\u2019s time for her to bust out and be her own character. When we got the nod to do the book back in 2013, that\u2019s what we had set out to do. It\u2019s worked out well.\u201d\n\nHarley Quinn and the Birds of Prey is a 32-page, four-issue miniseries. Look out for it come February.", "description": "Harley Quinn might actually be the most wanted woman in comics.
