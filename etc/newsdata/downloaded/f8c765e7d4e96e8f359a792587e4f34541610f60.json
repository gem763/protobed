FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson poses for a photograph prior to giving a statement to television after a meeting with Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, in Luxembourg\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE: ) said on Wednesday it was negative about the prospects of Prime Minister Boris Johnson striking a Brexit deal at the Oct. 17-18 EU summit.\n\n\"Our reading of the situation is much more negative than positive as far as the prospects of a revised Withdrawal Agreement being agreed at the October summit are concerned,\" it said in a note to clients.\n\n\"The UK\u2019s negotiating approach appears to be to present the details of its proposals late in the process, and to use the brute force of a no-deal threat to force the EU to accept them,\" JPMorgan said. \"The very limited credibility of that threat adds to reasons why such a brute-force approach is not going to work.\"\n\nJohnson has said he can get a deal at the summit though he has cautioned that if he does not, the United Kingdom will leave on Oct. 31 without a deal.\n\nJPMorgan's Malcolm Barr said reports of a shift in the position of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party - which props up Johnson's government - were misplaced.\n\n\"Time is increasingly short,\" the note said. \"Any deal that had 'alternative arrangements' at its heart would be a complex one, given the EU\u2019s demand that a well-defined and legally operative \u2018solution\u2019 for Ireland be included in the Withdrawal Agreement.\"", "description": "JPMorgan says UK unlikely to get a Brexit deal at October summit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8H0NE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
