She had spent the evening before her death watching a film with her family and had been planning for the future.\n\nHer family said she had been grounded and stopped from going to a party and had some worries about her GCSE results being worse than expected but added nothing had suggested she wanted to take her own life.\n\nThe coroner said Naylor had no alcohol or drugs in her system and her father Martin Naylor added he had seen her two hours before she was found, and felt it was \"a spur of the moment\" act and she had not intended to kill herself.\n\nHe told South London Coroners Court: \"I honestly believe she was just making some sort of point.\n\n\"I genuinely believe she did not mean to do it.\"\n\nSearches of her phones, laptop, and social media accounts did not present anything suspicious.\n\nFollowing her death in April, A&J Management said they would \"miss her greatly\".\n\nImage copyright BBC/The Foundation/Graham Hunter Image caption Mya-Lecia, left, had been in the cast of Millie Inbetween from its first series\n\nCBBC announced the news of her death on its website, where young fans shared their memories of the actress.\n\nTributes have been paid to the teenager, who starred as Fran in two series of Millie Inbetween, about two sisters whose parents have split up, and Mya in Almost Never, about a fictional boyband and rival girl group Girls Here First.\n\nNaylor played the lead singer of the girl band, and said in a recent interview that she'd always wanted to sing as well as act.
