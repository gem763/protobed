According to the government's own analysis, there would be a 3% increase in borrowing as a percentage of economic growth.\n\nThese are broad estimates and negotiations over the final shape of Britain's future relationship have not yet begun. However, the broad terms of the deal clearly risk a significant hit for the UK economy.", "description": "The UK government's own analysis suggests the UK economy will grow by almost 7% less than if the UK stays in the EU.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da84e274af9097ab060a0e3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
