PRECIOUS-Gold little changed after Fed outlook disappoints\n\n* BoJ leaves interest rates unchanged\n\n* Gold targets $1,446/oz - technicals\n\n\n\n(Adds comments, details and updates prices)\n\nBy Karthika Suresh Namboothiri\n\nSept 19 (Reuters) - Gold prices were little changed on\n\nThursday after declining up to 1% in the previous session as\n\nlack of clarity on the U.S. Federal Reserve's future monetary\n\npolicy easing kept markets cautious.\n\nThe Fed lowered interest rates for a second time this year\n\nin a 7-3 vote on Wednesday but signalled further cuts are\n\nunlikely as the labour market remains strong. The cut was widely expected, but the split vote has raised\n\nsome concern about predicting the future path of monetary\n\npolicy.\n\n\"Traders are disappointed by the divergence of future rate\n\ncut path and the market is unwinding expectations of a few more\n\ncuts in the months to come,\" said Margaret Yang Yan, a market\n\nanalyst at CMC Markets.\n\n\"People are looking to take profit and lock gains. There is\n\na need for price consolidation before gold prices pick up.\"\n\nSpot gold was barely changed at $1,494.05 per ounce\n\nas of 0400 GMT, after a 0.6% drop on Wednesday. However, U.S.\n\ngold futures GCcv1 were down 1% at $1,501.40 per ounce.\n\nCentral banks globally are facing increasing pressure to\n\ndole out monetary support for flagging economies as the\n\nU.S.-China trade dispute hits global economic growth.\n\nLower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding\n\nnon-yielding gold, and weighs on the dollar.\n\n\"Gold looks vulnerable. If the Fed is right to proceed with\n\ncaution \u2013 meaning the global environment is not as dire as\n\nstimulus-hungry markets seem to envision \u2013 that implies less\n\nscope for overall easing,\" said Ilya Spivak, a senior currency\n\nstrategist at DailyFx.\n\nA close below $1,480 would set the stage for a retest of the\n\n$1,400 level initially and may then pave the way for a deeper\n\npullback, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady but\n\nsaid it would re-examine economic and price developments more\n\nthoroughly at its next policy meeting, amid growing risks to the\n\ncountry's fragile economic recovery. Spot gold is poised to break a support at $1,488 per ounce\n\nand fall to the next support at $1,446, according to Reuters\n\ntechnical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, silver dropped 0.3% to\n\n$17.68 per ounce, and platinum XPT= slipped 0.2% to $928.73.\n\nPalladium XPD= was unchanged at $1,591.19 per ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold little changed after Fed outlook disappoints", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEAAB09Y_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
