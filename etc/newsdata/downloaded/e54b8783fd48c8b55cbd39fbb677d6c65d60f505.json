We, too, believe that diplomacy and trade can be democratising forces. But when a repressive government refuses to evolve or, indeed, when it doubles down, cooperation can become complicity,\u201d the members wrote to Cook.\n\nApple declined to comment on that latest appeal but said on 9 October that it had begun an immediate investigation after \u201cmany concerned customers in Hong Kong\u201d contacted it about the app and the company found it had endangered law enforcement and residents.\n\nIt said the HKMap app \u201chas been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement\u201d.\n\nThe group of lawmakers wrote separately to Activision Blizzard\u2019s chief executive Robert Kotick, calling on him to reverse the company\u2019s decision to ban a player who voiced support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Activision Blizzard did not immediately comment on Friday.\n\n'Protecting rioters': China warns Apple over app that tracks Hong Kong police Read more\n\nCritics said Apple acted after pressure from Beijing in a commentary in the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper.\n\nThe lawmakers said Apple has censored at least 2,200 apps in China, citing the nonprofit group GreatFire.\n\nApple\u2019s action came amid a furore surrounding the US National Basketball Association after a team official tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protests, which led Chinese sponsors and partners to cut ties with the NBA.\n\nLast week, Blizzard reduced the punishment dealt out to Chung Ng Wai, a Hong Kong-based Hearthstone esports gamer, for his public support of pro-democracy protests after its decision sparked controversy among players and the public.\n\nBlizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, said initially that it would suspend the player from competition for a year and strip him of prize money.\n\nThe warning comes before a mass rally organisers are planning to press their demands on Sunday. Police refused to authorise the march, citing risks to public safety and order, but protesters have previously ignored such rejections.\n\nOn Saturday Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam took to the airwaves to back the use of force by police. She told broadcaster RTHK that police had used appropriate force in handling the protests, and were responding to protesters\u2019 violence, amid criticism of heavy-handed tactics.\n\nOn Friday night Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters donned cartoon character masks as they formed human chains across the city, in defiance of a government ban on face coverings at public assemblies.", "description": "US lawmakers including Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez write to Tim Cook urging him to restore HKMapp app", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1152a434b11a5c197786788ad23437a408da02f9/577_657_2478_1488/master/2478.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b497572189d652cca3a35807b62e6992", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
