Lindsey Graham on Sunday repeatedly dismissed the whistleblower\u2019s complaint against President Donald Trump as \u201call hearsay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis seems to me like a political setup. It's all hearsay. You can't get a parking ticket conviction based on hearsay. The whistleblower didn't hear the phone call,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d adding he has \u201czero problems\u201d with the president's phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nGraham pushed back against host Margaret Brennan\u2019s assertion that the whistleblower complaint largely matches the White House summary of the call. The evidence laid out in the complaint, she added, is based on information gathered from numerous White House officials.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is a sham. \u2026 Who is this whistleblower? What bias do they have? Why did they pick this whistleblower to tell a hearsay story? The transcript does not match the complaint,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis thing stinks.\u201d\n\nWrapping up the interview, Brennan asked what advice Graham gave the president when they golfed Saturday.\n\n\u201cKeep fighting back. We have your back on this,\" Graham replied. \"I am openly telling everybody in the country, I have the president's back because I think this is a setup.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story's subheadline misidentified the network that broadcasts \"Face the Nation.\"", "description": "\u201cThis seems to me like a political setup.
