Eagles! Fly!\u201d or \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S\u201d chants become too overwhelming for any fan with sensory needs at Lincoln Financial Field, the Philadelphia Eagles took a big step to make sure they don\u2019t have to leave the game or event.\n\nThe Eagles partnered with Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and nonprofit KultureCity in the offseason to build a state-of-the-art sensory room on a suites level inside the Linc to accommodate fans and families managing sensory challenges.\n\nThey became the first NFL team to open a sensory room inside their stadium on August 4. The Vikings and Jaguars also opened similar rooms last month. Several more NFL teams will be considered sensory-inclusive certified, meaning fans will have sensory bags available if they need them. Sensory bags contain noise-cancelling headphones, fidget tools, verbal cue cards and weighted lap pads.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about families with children with autism coming to a game, there\u2019s barriers to re-entry, there\u2019s sensory overload when we score a touchdown and there\u2019s pyrotechnics,\u201d said Ryan Hammond, executive director of the Eagles Autism Challenge. \u201cWe felt the sensory room was what we needed to be fully accessible and the idea behind it was not to change the experience but deliver a solution if they needed to take a break. If the sensory bag wasn\u2019t enough, you don\u2019t have to leave the stadium. You can take a break, de-escalate, calm down and rejoin the experience when you felt ready.\u201d\n\nEagles owner Jeffrey Lurie\u2019s brother, Peter, is autistic, so funding autism research has been an important initiative for him and the franchise. The Eagles Autism Challenge, the team\u2019s signature fundraising event, has raised more than $6 million in the first two years.\n\n\u201cIt really was the vision of Jeffrey Lurie,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cHe has a personal connection to autism and he found that with the prevalence increasing and one in 59 families affected, they need a voice and the voice being the Philadelphia Eagles would really echo around the globe so we launched the Eagles Autism Challenge initially as a fundraising event. \u2026 But this event can\u2019t be just one day and we wanted to be authentic to this commitment. We wanted to do more and the sensory room over a year in the making.\u201d\n\nThe 500-square-foot room includes several activity boards, large building blocks and no windows. The room was designed by medical professionals to ensure a quieter and more secure environment so the colors, lighting and sound were carefully selected.\n\n\u201cWe see it benefiting fans with anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder or anyone who feels overwhelmed in the environment,\u201d Hammond said.\n\nLongtime Eagles fan Victor Ykoruk\u2019s 10-year-old twin sons, Jack and Ryan, have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum. Ykoruk said the sensory room makes him feel more comfortable taking them to a game.\n\n\u201cWith my sons being on the spectrum, coming down to such a fun, amazing atmosphere but Philly is known to be a raucous atmosphere, I got a little nervous,\u201d Victor Ykoruk said before a preseason game. \u201cBut now the Eagles and CHOP together have created a domain that is so comfortable and pleasurable and it puts my boys at ease. I\u2019m proud to be an Eagles fan. The organization is nothing short of world class.\u201d\n\nKultureCity has created more than 200 sensory inclusive venues in three countries. As part of the certification process, the Eagles had about 700 game-day and full-time employees receive training on how to recognize and help fans who might be experiencing a sensory overload situation.\n\n\u201cIt was about being all in,\u201d Hammond said.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "If the chorus of \"Fly!
