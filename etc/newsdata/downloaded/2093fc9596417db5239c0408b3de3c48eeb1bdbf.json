Indigenous leaders, in turn, will call on their followers to end protests and street blockades.\n\n\u201cComrades, a deal is compromise on both sides,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cThe indigenous mobilization will end and Decree 883 will be lifted.\u201d\n\nThe two sides will work together to develop a new package of measures to cut government spending, increase revenues and reduce Ecuador\u2019s unsustainable budget deficits and public debt.\n\n\u201cThe moment of peace, of agreement, has come for Ecuador,\u201d said Arnaud Peral, the United Nations\u2019 resident coordinator in Ecuador and one of the mediators of the nationally televised talks, which started about 6 p.m. \u201cThis deal is an extraordinary step.\u201d\n\nWearing the feathered headdress and face paint of the Achuar people of the Amazon rain forest, the president of the Confederation of Indigenous Nations, Jaime Vargas, thanked Moreno and demanded improved long-term conditions for indigenous Ecuadorians.\n\n\u201cWe want peace for our brothers and sisters in this country,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want more repression.\u201d\n\nProtests over the austerity package have blocked roads, shuttered businesses from dairies to flower farms and halved Ecuador\u2019s oil production, forcing a temporary halt to the country\u2019s most important export.\n\nIn a shift from the heated language of the last 10 days of protests, each side at the negotiations praised the other\u2019s willingness to talk as they outlined their positions in the first hour before a short break.\n\nOther indigenous demands included higher taxes on the wealthy and the firing of the interior and defense ministers over their handling of the protests.\n\n\u201cFrom our heart, we declare that we, the peoples and nations, have risen up in search of liberty,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cWe recognize the bravery of the men and women who rose up.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, hundreds of black-clad riot police drove protesters out of north-central Quito\u2019s Arbolito Park, the epicenter of the protests, and into surrounding streets.\n\nThe park had filled Friday with mostly peaceful protesters chanting against the government. But by Sunday afternoon the air was white with smoke from burning tires and tear gas after more than 24 hours of clashes between police and hard-core protesters armed with sharpened sticks and shields improvised out of satellite dishes or plywood. Adjoining streets were piled high with burned tires, tree branches and paving stones.\n\nVolunteer medics from the fire department and medical schools waved white sheets on poles as they led downcast protesters out of the area to safety. Young men from Ecuador\u2019s indigenous minority and mixed race, or mestizo, majority, milled about on streets under the watch of police and a few dozen soldiers.\n\nThe public ombudsman\u2019s office said Sunday that seven people had died in the protests, 1,340 had been hurt and 1,152 arrested. The government loosened a 24-hour curfew imposed Saturday, allowing people to move freely around the capital between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m.\n\nThe protests have drawn thousands of Ecuadorians from outside the indigenous minority.\n\nMichael Limaico, an unemployed sign-maker, stood on a corner in the Carcelen neighborhood Saturday near a line of burned tires that blocked one of the Quito\u2019s main thoroughfares. Limaico said that he and his wife had struggled for years to feed and house their three children, ages 9 to 15, with their earnings of about $600 a month from odd jobs around northern Quito.\n\nThen, prices of food and other basic goods rose sharply after Moreno removed fuel subsidies Oct. 2. Limaico said it had become impossible to make ends meet, and he had been protesting for days with neighbors who have blocked Diego de Vazquez Avenue as it passes through Carcelen.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a protest of thieves, of gangsters,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the people, and we\u2019re fed up.\u201d\n\nMoreno said the masked protesters had nothing to do with the thousands of indigenous Ecuadorians who have protested for more than a week over the sudden rise in fuel prices, following on the heels of demonstrations by transport workers. Moreno blamed the violence on drug traffickers, organized crime and followers of former President Rafael Correa, who has denied allegations that he is trying to topple Moreno\u2019s government.\n\nMoreno served Correa as vice president before he become president and the two men went through a bitter split as Moreno pushed to curb public debt amassed on Correa\u2019s watch.\n\nForeign Minister Jos\u00e9 Valencia told The Associated Press on Sunday that the Moreno administration believed Correa, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Colombia\u2019s far-left FARC and ELN guerrillas are working to destabilize Ecuador. He offered no proof beyond the fact that a handful of Correa loyalists and some Venezuelan nationals had been detained during the protests.\n\n\u201cThey have a political agenda and the violence and chaos that they sowed yesterday in the city, a coordinated chaos, lets us see this political agenda,\u201d Valencia said.\n\nCorrea and Maduro have denied involvement in the protests.\n\nEcuador, a former OPEC member, was left deeply in debt by a decade of high spending by Correa\u2019s government and the international decline in oil prices. Moreno is raising taxes, liberalizing labor laws and cutting public spending in order to get more than $4 billion in emergency financing from the IMF.\n\nAs part of that plan, Moreno\u2019s elimination of subsidies drove the most popular variety of gasoline from $1.85 to $2.39 a gallon and diesel from $1.03 to $2.30. Panic and speculation sent prices soaring, with costs of some products doubling or more.\n\nIn the country\u2019s Amazon oil fields, protests at installations, described by some government officials as attacks, have halted or slowed production.\n\nEcuador had been producing 430,000 barrels a day, but that had dropped to 176,029 barrels by Sunday, said an official at state oil producer Petroamazonas, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. The drop in output has led to a loss of about $14 million a day, the official said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Raisa Avila contributed to this report.", "description": "QUITO, Ecuador (AP) \u2014 President Len\u00edn Moreno\u00a0and leaders of Ecuador's indigenous peoples struck a deal late Sunday to cancel a disputed austerity package", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/ccddd8_ecuador-political-crisis-65652-indigenous-leaders-attend-negotiations-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
