One bank in South Korea told its customers to stop using the gadget\n\nAnd then her husband managed to unlock the phone with his own thumbprints, which weren't registered.\n\nShe said: 'This means that if anyone got hold of my phone they can access it and within moments could be into the financial apps and be transferring funds.\n\n'It's a real concern. We called Samsung because we thought there was a fault with the phone.\n\n'The man in customer services took control of the phone remotely and went into all the settings and finally admitted it looked like a security breach.'\n\nThe problem had begun after she'd bought a \u00a32.70 screen protector from eBay and fitted it.\n\nSouth Korea's online-only KaKaobank has told its customers to stop using the Galaxy 10 fingerprint recognition function to log into its services until the issue is resolved.\n\nLaunched in March, Galaxy S10 series phones have an in-display sensor that uses ultrasound to detect the ridges of fingerprints, which Samsung has touted as a 'revolutionary' biometric authentication feature.", "description": "South Korea-based Samsung said today it was aware of the problem with its biometric locking system and that it will roll out a software update to fix the bug spotted by a woman in West Yorkshire.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/19683232-0-Lisa_Neilson_34_from_Castleford_in_West_Yorkshire_bought_the_gel-a-5_1571320581583.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
