And with the appointment of the special prosecutor, there remains the possibility that Smollett cold be charged again with staging the attack.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A federal judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss Chicago's lawsuit against former \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Don Babwin"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/jussie_smollett_10310_c0-124-2983-1864_s1200x700.jpg?4beb78934fef545845d389f124aad8d9da2c0e79", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
