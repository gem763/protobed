The report did not mention the exact number by which Trump is looking to cut the agency's staff.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nThe development comes as Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are examining whether there are grounds to impeach Republican Trump based on a whistleblower's account that said he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to help investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nLawmakers are investigating concerns that Trump's actions have jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "description": "The step was described by some sources cited in the report as part of an effort from the White House to make its foreign policy arm leaner.
