USA TODAY\n\nShocking disappointments and better-than-expected performances are anticipated each weekend in the wild world of college football. Even if everyone knows they are coming, guessing when and where they will happen is difficult.\n\nThe USA TODAY Sports college football staff \u2014 Jace Evans, Paul Myerberg, George Schroeder, Erick Smith, Eddie Timanus and Dan Wolken \u2014 weigh in with some bold predictions for Week 6 of the college football season:\n\nJace Evans\n\nWhen Georgia last came to Neyland Stadium two seasons ago, Tennessee suffered its worst home loss since 1905, falling 41-0. The bad news for Vols fans: This weekend has the potential to be even worse. Tennessee sits at just 1-3 and is coming off a 34-3 loss to Florida \u2013 the Gators have been forced to turn to backup QB Kyle Trask \u2013 that marked one of UT\u2019s three most-lopsided defeats in that series. Starting with third-year starter Jake Fromm, Georgia is a better team than that Florida squad and has had two weeks to prepare. That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tennessee and embattled coach Jeremy Pruitt.\n\nGeorgia running back D'Andre Swift carries the ball against Tennessee during their game in 2018 at Sanford Stadium.

Iowa has shown enough so far, notably in beating Iowa State, to make a win on Saturday a potential turning point in how Michigan is perceived on a national level and perhaps a moment that lifts Jim Harbaugh\u2019s team back into contention for the College Football Playoff.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nSTAFF PICKS: Our experts predict Auburn-Florida and the rest of Week 6\n\nBIG GAMES: Five Week 6 matchups with College Football Playoff impact\n\nGeorge Schroeder\n\nIt is hard to overestimate just how bad things must be in Blacksburg, Virginia, these days. Virginia Tech losing to Duke \u2013 that\u2019s one thing. Losing by 35 \u2013 at home \u2013 is quite another. And while it\u2019s probably correctly illustrative of how much the program has slipped, it\u2019s not quite a free fall. Not quite. Or at least, not yet.\n\nThe Hokies have big issues. They might not be easily fixable. And Justin Fuente\u2019s seat could get much hotter in a hurry.\n\nBut Miami isn\u2019t exactly a juggernaut. The Hurricanes struggled to get past Central Michigan. Their offensive line has been porous. Virginia Tech\u2019s defense hasn\u2019t been good, but the Hokies will pull off a mild upset and at least postpone the slide.\n\nHOT SEATS: Eight college football coaches feeling pressure\n\nErick Smith\n\nThe biggest game of the year - the one you've been pointing to all offseason - is just one week away. The problem? You have to play on the road the Saturday before. Such is the situation for Oklahoma and Texas. For the Sooners, the challenge of getting up this week isn't an issue because Kansas is the opponent. Expect them to be lackluster and dispatch the Jayhawks later than you might anticipate.\n\nThe circumstances are different for the Longhorns, who travel to face West Virginia. The Mountaineers have quietly been building themselves up after a slow start to Neal Brown's tenure. Austin Kendall is more comfortable at quarterback, and the offense played better in defeats of North Carolina State and Kansas. If Texas is at all assuming this is going to be an easy day at the office, it won't end well.\n\nEddie Timanus\n\nIowa is going to beat Michigan.\n\nThis prediction might not seem terribly bold on its face since the Hawkeyes are actually ranked higher, but quality wins away from Iowa City haven\u2019t always come easily. This one won\u2019t be easy either by any means. The Wolverines might have figured some things out last week against Rutgers, and Iowa\u2019s resume to date is still quite thin.\n\nBut the Hawkeyes have two major advantages. The first is veteran quarterback Nate Stanley. His offense isn\u2019t the flashiest around, but he hasn\u2019t been intercepted this season and he knows how to keep his cool in hostile environs.\n\nIowa\u2019s other edge is its run defense. The Hawkeyes are giving up just 77 yards a game on the ground and have yet to surrender a rushing TD this season.\n\nYes, I remember what I said about that soft early Iowa schedule. But if the Hawkeyes can keep the Wolverines\u2019 running backs in check, Shea Patterson is going to have to take some chances. In short, he\u2019s going to make a mistake or two, and Stanley won\u2019t. Then that Big House crowd might get a little less friendly toward the home team.\n\nDan Wolken\n\nAs impressed as I\u2019ve been with Auburn, I wonder if the tank may be a bit empty after a pretty tough start to the season and with a bye week on the horizon. I don\u2019t think Florida is the eighth best team in the country because they\u2019re still a bit dysfunctional and sloppy on offense, but this is a good time to catch Auburn. I\u2019m going to bank on the Swamp playing a factor in disrupting the Auburn offense and Florida keeping it close enough that a turnover or two will make the difference for the Gators.", "description": "Expect the unexpected in college football each weekend.
