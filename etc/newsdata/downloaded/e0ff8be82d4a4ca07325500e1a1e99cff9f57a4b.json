He was hospitalized after being assaulted Saturday while sleeping on a park bench. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nUnder increasing public pressure to compensate five wrongly convicted men who spent decades behind bars, Maryland\u2019s Board of Public Works is weighing whether to give itself a deadline to act.\n\nTwo of the three board members said Wednesday that they should have a plan in place by Oct. 16 for deciding how much to pay the men, one of whom, Hubert James Williams, is homeless and was hospitalized after being assaulted Saturday while sleeping on a park bench.\n\nWilliams\u2019s pro bono lawyers have twice asked the board to approve a $35,000 interim payment to help him secure stable housing and substance abuse treatment. The board, which oversees major state contracts and spending, did not act on that request, nor mention it publicly at its regular meeting Wednesday.\n\nBut Comptroller Peter Franchot (D), who is considering a run for governor, urged an Oct. 16 deadline to come up with a plan. Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp (D) immediately agreed.\n\n\u201cThey need to be compensated as soon as possible,\u201d Franchot said of Williams and four others whose attorneys have petitioned the state for a total of $12 million. \u201cThey were deprived of years of freedom, opportunity and time with their family and friends, and the very least we could do is compensate them in a timely and fair manner.\u201d\n\n[Meet the five innocent men seeking millions of dollars from Maryland]\n\n\n\nClockwise from top left: Walter Lomax, Hubert James Williams, Lamar Johnson and Clarence Shipley Jr. They and a fifth man, Jerome Johnson, are seeking $12 million from the state of Maryland after being imprisoned for a total of 120 years for crimes they did not commit. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nGov. Larry Hogan (R), who chairs the panel, was absent from the meeting and did not respond to a request for comment. His designee at the session, Lt. Gov. Boyd K. Rutherford, did not express an opinion on Franchot\u2019s proposed timeline.\n\nMaryland is among 35 states that permits payments to exonerees, but it has been among the slowest at approving them. The last exonerated prisoner to be compensated by the state was paid 15 years ago.\n\nWilliams, Lamar Johnson, Jerome Johnson, Walter Lomax and Clarence Shipley Jr. have been waiting as long as 19 months for the state to approve their petitions, which seek roughly $100,000 for each year they were wrongly imprisoned.\n\nMore than 10 weeks has passed since a joint letter from the men\u2019s attorneys asked the state to \u201cswiftly\u201d negotiate and approve the compensation. Last month, 50 state lawmakers including House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County) urged the panel to make a decision.\n\nUnder state law, the Board of Public Works has the power to determine and approve such awards for exonerees. But state lawmakers and Hogan, among others, have sought to establish a more formal process for deciding how much money should be allocated to the wrongly convicted.\n\nThe governor\u2019s proposed plan for deciding compensation is expected next week, Franchot and others said. Hogan, who has said \u201cthere is no question that they deserve to be compensated,\u201d blames Democrats in the General Assembly for not enacting legislation with specific guidelines on compensation. Lawmakers dismiss that critique as an attempt to avoid blame.\n\n[Here\u2019s how Maryland has paid exonerated prisoners in the past]\n\nOn Wednesday, without mentioning Williams by name, Rutherford said he had learned that morning that one of exonerees was hospitalized. He said the state was trying to secure a bed in a state substance abuse treatment facility and searching for a way to transport the exoneree there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to see if there\u2019s something we can do for one of the individuals who is suffering right now,\u201d Rutherford said at the meeting.\n\nLawyers for Williams, who spent 11 years in prison for an attempted murder committed by someone else, said they were not notified of the state\u2019s efforts to secure treatment for their client until contacted by a reporter.\n\nThe lawyers said Williams, who has long struggled with mental health and addiction problems, had been unreachable for about month before he was hospitalized with a head wound that required two stitches.\n\nWilliams was put on detoxification treatment and also is being treated for skin ulcers, a common ailment among inadequately clothed homeless people, the lawyers said.\n\nThey expect him to be discharged Friday \u2014 12 days before the next Board of Public Works meeting, which is on Oct. 16.\n\n\u201cIf James is released, then he\u2019s most likely back on the streets, and he won\u2019t resurface again until he\u2019s in the hospital again,\u201d attorney Andrew George said. \u201cEven waiting until the next meeting isn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201d\n\nSitting in a room in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Williams said he did not remember all of the details of the weekend assault but that he recalls being propelled forward, as if someone were pushing him from behind, when he stood to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. He said his memory then went dark, and he woke up in a hospital bed.\n\nWilliams spends most nights sleeping on park benches in Silver Spring, where he said he panhandles for money, asking strangers whether they can spare 50 cents for bus fare for a veteran. Saturday was the first night he said he had spent in City Plaza, which is where he was attacked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to that environment,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s caused me nothing but problems.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he has sores on his body and needs a walker for his poor balance. But the walker he had received from Veterans Affairs was stolen from him, he said. He also said he has tried multiple rehabilitation programs but has always relapsed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve burned myself out,\u201d said Williams, adding that he knows he needs to get clean to avoid \u201cdrinking myself to death.\u201d\n\nHe started choking up thinking about the possibility of being on the streets this winter, and remembering all the housing denials he has experienced. \u201cI could freeze to death out there,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nThey spent 120 years in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.
