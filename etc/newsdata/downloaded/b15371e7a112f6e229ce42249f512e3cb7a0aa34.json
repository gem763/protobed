But another judge ruled on Saturday that gay and lesbian content for children should not be publicly displayed.\n\nToo late: The daily newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo featured the kiss on its front page Saturday.\n\nThe comic book quickly sold out at the fair after Crivella complained, CNN reported.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Crusade series has been available in Brazil since 2012, and the luxury hardcover volume at the book fair was released three years ago. Wiccan and Hulkling hadn\u2019t been an issue until Crivella made them one.\n\n\u201cBooks like this need to be wrapped in black sealed plastic with a content warning displayed on the outside,\u201d Crivella, who has called homosexuality \u201cevil,\u201d said in a videotaped message on Twitter Thursday. \u201cGuys! We need to protect our children,\u201d he said in a Google translation.\n\nPessoal, precisamos proteger as nossas crian\u00e7as.
