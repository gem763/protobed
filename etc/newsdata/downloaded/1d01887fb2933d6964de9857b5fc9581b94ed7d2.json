The diplomats, representing EU member states, agreed that signs of movement were promising enough to warrant the \"tunnel\".\n\nA UK government spokesperson and an EU Commission spokesperson both separately described the morning's meeting as \"constructive\", as did Mr Barnier.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator added: \"Brexit is like climbing a mountain. We need vigilance, determination and patience.\u201d\n\nA European Commission spokesperson said: \"The EU and UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days. The EU's position remains the same: there must be a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions, and safeguards the integrity of the single market.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that Mr Barnier would check back in with member states and MEPs to update them on progress on Monday.\n\nThe mood of talks swung towards last-minute optimism on Thursday after a meeting between Boris Johnson and Irish PM Leo Varadkar on Merseyside, where both sides spoke of a \"pathway to a deal\".\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
