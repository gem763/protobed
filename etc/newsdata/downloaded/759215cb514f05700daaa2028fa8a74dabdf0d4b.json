Though later famed for her beauty, Julie struggled to fit in at school, aware of what she describes as her bandy legs, buck teeth and lazy eye.\n\nMeanwhile, her stepfather \u2013 whom she called Pop \u2013 turned to drink and became increasingly volatile.\n\n\u201cHe would go on all-night benders,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe more Pop drank, the more abusive he became.\u201d\n\nBut while her home life was difficult, Julie\u2019s crystal-clear singing voice was getting her noticed. In her teens she was signed to an agent and went on to star in Cinderella at London\u2019s Palladium. By 19 she was performing on Broadway.\n\nAt 23, she married Tony Walton, a set designer she\u2019d known since they were teenagers.\n\nBy her mid-20s, she\u2019d landed starring roles in three big Broadway productions: The Boy Friend, My Fair Lady, and Camelot.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nAnd her stellar performance in Camelot got her noticed by Walt Disney. He saw the production and, entranced, met her backstage.\n\nJulie, now 84, was amazed when he asked her to play the lead in a new film he was working on, Mary Poppins.\n\n\u201cI was overwhelmed, but told him I was newly pregnant. To my astonishment, he replied, \u2018That\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll wait\u2019,\u201d she writes.\n\nTurning to Tony, Walt asked what he did for a living. On seeing his work, Walt offered him a job as the principal set and costume designer.\n\n\u201cWalt\u2019s persona was that of a kindly uncle \u2013 twinkly eyed, chivalrous and genuinely proud of all he\u2019d created,\u201d she writes. So, in 1962 with baby Emma in tow, they started their new life in Hollywood.\n\nWhen Emma was just three months old, Julie started on the film. She brought in a nanny during the week, and continued to breastfeed. It was during rehearsals that she developed Mary Poppins\u2019 signature walk.\n\n\u201cI felt she would never stroll leisurely, so I practised walking as fast as I could, placing one foot immediately after the other to give the impression of hardly touching the ground,\u201d she recalls.\n\n(Image: EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS)\n\nBut acting in Hollywood was a different world entirely from Broadway.\n\nJulie was amazed to discover how long it took to film a scene \u2013 including spending hours suspended by a harness. At one point, the wires gave way and she was dropped from the ceiling, narrowly avoiding injury.\n\nShe recalls letting rip a stream of expletives.\n\nTensions emerged between Walt and PL Travers, the author of Mary Poppins. When the writer was sent back to England to prevent her interfering, Julie acted as the peacemaker, writing to mollify her.\n\nShe understood Travers\u2019 concerns for her character, so she focused on how well the shooting was going.\n\nTravers would later praise Julie\u2019s beautifully understated performance. Julie went on to win an Oscar for Best Actress, as well as a Golden Globe, but hid the Oscar in her attic.\n\nShe had been disappointed at missing out on the role of Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, which went to Audrey Hepburn.\n\n\u201cI honestly felt I didn\u2019t deserve it, and that perhaps it had been given to me as a kind gesture because I hadn\u2019t been cast in My Fair Lady,\u201d she writes modestly of the Oscar.\n\nAt the ceremony, Audrey herself told her: \u201cJulie, you really should have done My Fair Lady... but I didn\u2019t have the guts to turn it down.\u201d\n\nHowever Julie\u2019s performance in Mary Poppins won her the role that defined her career, Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music.\n\nAmazingly she was worried about being typecast as another nanny.She had seen The Sound of Music on Broadway and wasn\u2019t a fan of its \u201csaccharine\u201d storyline.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nJulie\u2019s agent encouraged her to accept the part. The film was shot on location in Austria.\n\nPossibly the biggest challenge came in the boating scene, where Maria and her charges sing as they fall out of their boat into a lake.\n\nJulie says: \u201cThe assistant director waded rather urgently through the water towards me and whispered, \u2018The little one can\u2019t swim...\u2019 \u2018WHAT?!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said. \u2018We\u2019d be most grateful if you could get to her as quickly as possible once you\u2019re in the water\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the second take, the boat rocked so violently that I went over the back as Kym [the child actor playing Gretl] went over the front.\n\n\u201cI have never swum so fast in my life. I could see the poor child flailing away and going under at least twice.\n\n\u201cCrew members dove into the water to help save her, and mercifully we got there in time.\u201d\n\nFilming, including all the interior and terrace scenes, continued in the Hollywood studios and wrapped on September 1, 1964.\n\nOn its release the following year, Julie won a second Golden Globe.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, her marriage was unravelling.\n\nShe writes movingly of wanting to be the adoring wife her husband deserved but feeling the pull of Hollywood while he was unable to give up his work in London and New York.\n\nThe pair divorced, and in the late 1960s, she married US film-maker Blake Edwards, who was 13 years her senior and had two children of his own.\n\n(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nShe continued starring in films, including playing the lead in her husband\u2019s Darling Lili.\n\nThe couple tried unsuccessfully for more children. In the mid-1970s they adopted two girls from Vietnam, Amelia and Joanna.\n\nJulie felt increasingly torn between looking after her mum and dad, who lived in the UK, and looking after her children and Blake in the US.\n\nIn 1982, Julie starred in British comedy Victor/Victoria.\n\nAt the end of filming, she would reflect on whether her career would have been even more successful had she not been so devoted to her family.\n\n\u201cWould it have been better if I had sacrificed family, or husband?\u201d she wrote in her diary at the time.\n\nDespite her reservations, she won another Golden Globe.\n\nIn 1997, Julie\u2019s singing career was ended after she had throat surgery for strained vocal cords.\n\nDespite assurances her voice would recover, it was permanently damaged and husky.\n\nShe underwent four corrective surgeries, and in 2000, she won a payout from the hospital.\n\nIn 2010, Julie lost husband Blake to pneumonia. He was 88.\n\nIronically considering her initial reservation, looking back, Julie, who was made a Dame for services to performing arts, lauds The Sound of Music as her greatest career success. And its songs stay with her to this day.\n\n\u201cThe music, still \u2013 and always \u2013 lives in my bones and in my soul,\u201d she says.\n\n* Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years by Julie Andrews (Weidenfeld and Nicholson, \u00a320).\n\nDame Julie will discuss her book at Southbank Centre\u2019s Royal Festival Hall in association with FANE Productions on November 2.", "description": "As her new memoir Home Work reveals, behind the scenes Dame Julie Andrews\u2019 life wasn\u2019t always \u201cpractically perfect in every way\u201d", "authors": ["Elizabeth Archer", "Image", "Twentieth Century Fox", "Daily Record", "Express Newspapers", "Getty Images", "Corbis Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586881.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Julie-Andrews.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
