You just say 6.41am\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nPiers then hit back at his co-host by trying to justify what he had done, which only led to more Ron Burgundy comparsons.\n\n\"If you don't want me to say 'time check' don't put it in the auto-cue,\" claimed Piers.\n\nSusanna joked that viewers did need to know the time because they often go on talking for so long.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHitting out at the whole premise, Piers said: \"Why do we even do time check? If people don't know the time what's the point? It's on the TV right?\"\n\nSusanna explained that one lovely boy that came into the studio loved the fact they do the time check throughout the morning.\n\nThe camera then spun round to show viewers exactly what had popped up on the auto-cue - with 'TIME CHECK' in big letters.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nPiers said: \"Now look viewers. You see that. What are you going to do? You're going to read 'time check'.\n\nCharlotte Hawkins then pointed out that Piers had made a double blunder as he had actually read Susanna's line.\n\nRed-faced Piers turned the tables and insisted Susanna often reads his lines.\n\nShe added: \"No but when it says 'Susanna' it's me that reads and I never say 'time check' I just look at the time because it says 'time check'.\"\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV at 6am", "description": "The Good Morning Britain presenter read out exactly what was on the auto-cue in the style of Run Burgundy", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544486.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_EHP_CHP_091019GMB_5667JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
