As a result, the law has turned a blind eye to harmful conduct. And now, in a final irony, it is threatening to condemn responsible corporate citizenship.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department has reportedly launched an antitrust investigation into four automakers\u2014Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen. Their supposed offense? Agreeing with one another, and with the state of California, to develop vehicles that are more fuel-efficient and have lower emissions than federal standards require. This is a noble goal. As any introductory economics textbook explains, pollution is a classic example of market failure. The problem arises from a negative externality: When cars emit carbon, all of us\u2014not just buyers and sellers of cars\u2014bear the costs.\n\nThe automakers\u2019 agreement, which seeks to reduce that externality, is the exact opposite of selfish behavior: It is likely to increase the automakers\u2019 own costs, rather than their profits. In short, this is a very strange choice of target for an antitrust-enforcement agency. But the Trump administration is keen on lowering federal environmental standards\u2014apparently even to the point of targeting companies that are willing to hold themselves to higher ones.\n\nWhile some companies are at risk of being punished for fighting pollution, others are getting a pass despite creating a negative externality. The conservative wing of the Supreme Court recently did just that in Ohio v. American Express. The genesis of the case was an Obama-administration lawsuit against American Express targeting certain rules in the credit-card giant\u2019s contracts with business owners. Under those rules, businesses cannot tell their customers how big a cut Amex takes from each purchase, nor can they offer a discount to shoppers who use less expensive cards. The rules obviously harm merchants, especially small businesses.\n\nRead: How to fight Amazon (before you turn 29)\n\nBut one of their most pernicious effects stems from a negative externality. Because businesses cannot signal to their customers which payment options are more expensive, they are forced to raise prices across the board to make up for Amex\u2019s high fees. Those fees partially pad Amex\u2019s bottom line, but they also help fund lavish reward-points programs for its cardholders\u2014a relatively wealthy group. As a result, everyday consumers who buy necessities with cash or food stamps end up subsidizing free first-class flights and four-star hotel stays for Amex cardholders. The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative justices decided this scheme is actually good because it helps Amex attract cardholders\u2014and they simply ignored the harmful spillover effects on the rest of society.", "description": "Laws meant to curb corporate power and greed are\u2014in the hands of the Trump administration and a conservative Supreme Court\u2014being used against the public good instead.", "authors": ["John Newman", "Former Attorney With The U.S. Department Of Justice Antitrust Division"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX315XL_1-5/facebook.jpg?1568122545", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
