BP declined a Reuters request for comment.\n\nATC also bought Omani crude, one market source said. The company is looking to import condensate from the market, sources said.\n\nSaudi Arabia will not import crude to meet its domestic needs, one source said.\n\n\u201cWhy do that (when) we have crude storage?\u201d\n\nSaudi oil exports were proceeding, the source added, \u201cexactly like they were (before) to meet the market\u2019s needs\u201d.", "description": "Saudi Aramco is buying oil originating in neighboring countries to meet its supply obligations to foreign refineries, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, after crippling attacks on the company's installations 10 days ago.", "authors": ["Rania El Gamal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433371164&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1AH", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
