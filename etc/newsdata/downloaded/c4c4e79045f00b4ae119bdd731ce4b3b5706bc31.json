Therefore, this week I\u2019m cheering comedian Dave Chappelle\u2019s new Netflix standup special \u201cSticks and Stones.\u201d\n\nFull disclosure: I haven\u2019t even watched it yet .I promise I will and I hope you will too. Not because we\u2019re going to agree with everything Chappelle says. It\u2019s precisely because we don\u2019t HAVE to agree with everything he says. More to the point, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s celebrating. \u201cOffensive\u201d is in the eye of the scolder. Comedy \u2013 if done well -\u2013 isn\u2019t something to be consumed and enjoyed in lockstep.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what the totalitarian mentality of the American left has wrought. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that! You can\u2019t laugh at that! That\u2019s not funny! You aren\u2019t allowed to joke about that!\u201d The early reviews from mainstream critics confirm Chappelle\u2019s response was, \u201cOh yeah? Watch me.\u201d\n\nEthan Nicole of The Babylon Bee tweeted, \u201cThe scolds came out in full force against the Chappelle special, prompting me to immediately watch it. I\u2019m tempted to say it was brilliant just to get under their skin .As comedy it was good, but more than that, it was an aggressive defense of comedy\u2026\u201d\n\nWell overdue.\n\nIn preparing for my shows this week, I\u2019ve read a range of left-wing critics pillory Chappelle. The Daily Beast agonizes over whether Chappelle really means what he\u2019s saying in his special or if the jokes were crafted specifically to trigger outraged reviews and deliver his larger point about outrage culture reaction. (The answer is yes, by the way. He played you all like a Stradivarius).\n\nOver at Vice, they flat-out demand their readers \u201cdefinitely skip\u201d the new standup special because Chappelle \u201cchooses to blatantly ignore the historic criticism against his style of comedy\u2026\u201d Excuse me?! Is \u201cVice\u201d shorthand for Vice Principal or Vice Squad? How dare a comic ignore Vice\u2019s demands! Didn\u2019t Chappelle get his handbook of things Vice won\u2019t allow us to joke about going forward?\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s Hanna Giorgis may have struck the most goose-stepping, authoritative tone in her final summary of the show. \u201c'Sticks and Stones' registers as a temper tantrum, the product of a man who wants it all \u2013 money, fame, influence \u2013 without much having to answer to anyone.\u201d\n\nHear that, Dave Chappelle? Ms. Giorgis says you must answer to someone if you\u2019re to be rich AND famous AND influential in her country! When do we put Chairman Giorgis\u2019 face on our currency and hang her mandatory portrait in our homes?\n\nWe\u2019re in an era where comedians are trying to reclaim their freedom to be funny and offensive once again. Yet sadly, they still often pledge lip service to the very political movements assailing their livelihoods and silencing their art.\n\nI read Chappelle opens his show taking a shot at the Founding Fathers, specifically referencing their role in slavery while drafting the Constitution. Of course that\u2019s met with wild, approving cheers from leftists in the crowd. The left hates the founding of this country.\n\nBut comedians like Chappelle should not.\n\nThe irony in the criticism is our country was designed to promote and protect individuals. Yes, there was the original sin of slavery. We weren\u2019t perfect but the protection of individualism was paramount, even if it didn\u2019t exist for everyone from the jump. It\u2019s what the Bill of Rights was all about. It\u2019s what Chappelle can count on today in the midst of the attacks from the American left.\n\nDemocrats bleed collectivism. They are anti-free speech. Their new enforcement tool is mob rule. Specifically, social media mob rule. \"Dox him! Fire him! Cancel him! Shame him!\" No credible comedian in 2019 can possibly stand with the politics of that kind of ideology and succeed, yet many still claim to.\n\nComedians make their living as individuals. Collectivism \u2013 comedy\u2019s natural enemy \u2013 relies on mobs. Individuals can comfortably rely on our founding for protection from collectivism as long as they\u2019re willing to claim it.\n\nThe Constitution is what protects comedians from mob rule. And yes, some of the men behind that document left a legacy of slavery. But too few in comedy can get past that to make the connection their freedom to say whatever the hell they want is also the legacy of those old, white men.\n\nSure, it\u2019s important for comedians to criticize and rant against oppressive attitudes, stuffiness, and political correctness, as Chappelle does in his latest special. But I\u2019d ask him to go one step further and explain to our betters at The Atlantic why it is he can be rich AND popular and no, not have to answer to anyone for any of it. There\u2019s a very good reason.\n\nIt\u2019s those founding white men who tried to protect every individual from tyranny. From governments, from media, and from the mobs they would inevitably lead. They knew government instinctively attracts wannabe oppressors and mobs.\n\nOur founding was based on the value of the individual. Comedians are flailing away looking for a non-political solution to stop the mobs from destroying their craft.The only thing that will protect them is embracing the concepts of our founding.Otherwise, a government or mob unrestrained will ultimately dominate.See Hong Kong for more.\n\nThe Constitution can and does continue to protect Mr. Chappelle until this toxic, mob rule \u201ccancel culture\u201d wises up. Hopefully he\u2019s willing to fight as hard for it as he\u2019s fighting the mobs in his new special.\n\nUntil then, I look forward to being offended.", "description": "These days I\u2019m prone to measure my support for something, .09/02/2019 3:21:01AM EST.", "authors": ["Chris Stigall", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/239/45c4ce72-bd72-4314-9837-6ac7e646c195.png"}
