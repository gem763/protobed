I don't think they've really worked this through.\n\n\"They think making me trend worldwide for two days, making me the most talked about breakfast presenter in the world, will get rid of me.\n\n\"Let me tell you what you've done. You've helped me get a payrise. Cheers everybody.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIt came after the presenter sparked fears he had actually been fired this morning after missing the start of today's show.\n\nEven Susanna Reid thought the petition to sack her co-host had succeeded when he wasn't in his seat when the cameras started rolling.\n\nHowever, Piers frantically dashed into the studio in a nick of time and was ready at 6.01am.\n\nGrinning Susanna joked: \"For a moment there I thought the petition had succeeded.\"\n\nPiers was forced to explain why he was running late - and it had nothing to do with the #FirePiers campaign.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe explained: \"This has really freaked me out and it might be a sign of ongoing problems. I was in my dressing room a few minutes ago. I was a bit tired this morning.\n\n\"I was doing my tie in the mirror and I thought 'I haven't shaved'. Every morning, shower, shave. I was like 'how can I forget to shave?'.\"\n\nPiers realised he could not \"get away\" with a slight stubble and had to use an emergency electric razor.\n\nSusanna said: \"I thought we were going to start the programme without you here and people would think the petition to get rid of Piers Morgan had succeeded. But there were actually more signatures on the petition to save you.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
