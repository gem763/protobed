People loved throwing money at him.\n\nIn a January financing round, investors were so beguiled by Mr. Neumann that his fast-growing office-space rental startup, formerly known as WeWork, achieved an implied valuation of $47 billion.\n\nA skeptical person might have wondered if that figure was appropriate for a company that lost $1.6 billion in 2018 on revenues of $1.82 billion, but Mr. Neumann\u2019s backers believed.\n\nThis month, ahead of a proposed initial public offering, the skeptics finally pulled the fire alarm. Faced with mounting concerns about its business model, governance and future profit potential, the company considered slashing its valuation by more than half before deciding, early this week, to postpone the IPO.\n\nShortly thereafter, this newspaper reported new details about unusual personal deals Mr. Neumann had cut with the company. It also revealed that the CEO smokes marijuana on private jets, aspires to become a trillionaire, wants to live forever and would like to serve as president of the world.\n\nNone of this made it any easier to understand how he raised so much money.\n\nThe 40-year-old Mr. Neumann is by all accounts an exceptional salesman. But I suspect there\u2019s another, deeper reason for his investor appeal.\n\nFor about a decade, the business world has been bracing for the arrival of what might best be described as the \u201cMillennial Prophet.\u201d At a time when young, brash, visionary CEOs have disrupted nearly everything, it only seems logical that one of them will solve the biggest challenge of all\u2014reinventing work itself.\n\nIn Mr. Neumann, these investors may have thought they had their man.\n\nRelated Video The We Co.\u2019s rapid expansion and flexible business model have helped it stay out in front of competitors. But some investors are saying its public offering might not be worth the risk. Here\u2019s why.

In fact, it dates all the way back to another wildly ambitious CEO, Henry Ford.\n\nWhen Ford started selling automobiles in the early 1900s, the U.S. was approaching the peak of the industrial age. The old agrarian ideal of self-reliance and rugged individualism had faded. People were flocking to cities to work in factories.\n\nFord was an engineer, but he also harbored some bold, utopian, and sometimes abhorrent, views about how the world worked and how people ought to live. He knew the country was undergoing a shift and that automobiles would only accelerate the process. He viewed building a company as a chance to re-engineer society.\n\nIn 1914, according to Steven Watts \u2019s 2005 biography, \u201cThe People\u2019s Tycoon,\u201d Ford roughly doubled the basic pay for his workers to $5 a day\u2014a stunning move that lifted scores of laborers into a new middle class. Ford also believed that in the industrial age, leisure time would no longer be a luxury for the wealthy, and might be a great tool for boosting worker morale and productivity. In the 1920s, he capped the company workweek at five days and 40 hours.\n\nFor more than a century, companies have followed Ford\u2019s basic principle\u2014you give me 40 hours of dutiful toil and I\u2019ll give you the financial means to pursue happiness at home. For decades, whenever pollsters asked people to rank their priorities in life, their answers mirrored this bargain. Things like having a family, owning a home and living in peace ranked well ahead of having a great job.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How much should companies change the workplace to satisfy the desires of younger workers? Join the conversation below.\n\nTo understand what some investors might have seen in Mr. Neumann, it helps to consider what\u2019s happened, more recently, when Gallup\u2019s pollsters have asked people the same question. Having a rewarding job no longer ranks near the bottom\u2014it\u2019s climbed to the top. In other words, the world seems to have changed again. Modern workers aren\u2019t just content to be happy at home. They want work to be fulfilling, too.\n\nThe first companies to address this problem were Silicon Valley startups in the late 1990s that decided to install office ping-pong tables. The future of work, it seemed, was about making it \u201cfun.\u201d\n\nWhen that notion fizzled, employers wondered if people might enjoy their jobs more and put in longer hours if the office had hip d\u00e9cor and on-site food, laundry and haircuts. That didn\u2019t work either. If anything, the evidence suggests modern employees are less interested in perks than feeling a sense of belonging.\n\nEven companies that adopt open floor plans to improve communication and collaboration often end up creating new problems.\n\nCompanies like Uber Technologies Inc. have presented workers with a new bargain\u2014in exchange for giving up comforts like job security and benefits, they\u2019ll have more control over how and when they work. As these informal contract jobs or \u201cgigs\u201d explode, however, regulators are cracking down.\n\nWhile companies grope for answers, young workers have never been less likely to thrive in the old Ford system. Research shows they\u2019re better educated, more concerned with finding social purpose at work and less resistant to changing jobs. High debt loads often force them to delay or forgo buying a home, getting married or having kids.\n\nMr. Neumann in 2014.

What makes him different from most young CEOs, however, is that work is the actual thing he\u2019s trying to disrupt.\n\nIn exchange for rent payments, Mr. Neumann\u2019s company promises workers entree to a vibrant community. They\u2019ll work in hip, inviting, fun communal spaces with organized social events, many points of connection and all the latest technology\u2014or what the company describes as a \u201cphysical social network.\u201d The company also advertises flexible leases that make it easier to come and go and change trajectories.\n\nPart of Mr. Neumann\u2019s pitch, however, is that We is only getting started. The company has made a foray into developing and leasing shared living spaces, for example. And at an employee retreat last year, Mr. Neumann suggested the company could some day take on major social problems, including hunger. \u201cThe influence and impact that we are going to have on this Earth is going to be so big,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Neumann may not be the Millennial Prophet, but it\u2019s easy to understand why investors might have tolerated, or even appreciated his quirks and grand ambitions. After all, Henry Ford was a deeply flawed fellow with a messianic streak.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that there simply isn\u2019t any profitable way to turn offices into human fulfillment zones. Maybe the problem with work is that no matter how you dress it up, it\u2019s still work. Maybe Henry Ford\u2019s deal is the best one we\u2019ll get.\n\nOne thing is certain, though. There\u2019s a fortune to be made by trying.\n\n\u2014 Mr. Walker, a former reporter and editor at The Wall Street Journal, is the author of \u201cThe Captain Class: A New Theory of Leadership\u201d (Random House).\n\nWrite to Sam Walker at sam.walker@wsj.com", "description": "How was the We Co.
