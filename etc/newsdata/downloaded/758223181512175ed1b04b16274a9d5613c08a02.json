And the Worst", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nHealth care stocks have had a slow September. The S&P 500 Health Care sector is down 1.2% since the start of the month, compared with a 1.2% gain for the S&P 500, but that doesn\u2019t mean nothing has happened.\n\nAbbvie, for one, has taken off, while Incyte has tanked. Below, we\u2019ve collected the three best-performing health care stocks this month, and the three worst.\n\nThe Good\n\nPerrigo (ticker: PRGO)\n\nShares of Perrigo, which makes over-the-counter drugs sold largely under other companies\u2019 names, has had a strong month, up 17.5%. The stock jumped early this month on news that the company had purchased the rights to sell the heartburn drug Prevacid24hr in the U.S.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nAfter plummeting 30% from the beginning of the year through mid-August, AbbVie is crawling back, rising 13.9% so far in September. Investors appear to be warming to the company\u2019s controversial deal to acquire Allergan (AGN) as a string of analysts upgrade the stock.\n\nVarian Medical Systems (VAR)\n\nVarian, a radiation oncology company, is also in recovery. The stock fell 22.2% in July and August. So far this month, it\u2019s up 11.6%. All that volatility comes in part from tariff worries. In mid-September, China exempted some of the company\u2019s devices from tariffs, giving the stock a boost.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIncyte (INCY)\n\nDrugmaker Incyte is down 11% so far in September. The stock is up 14.5% since the start of the year, but has had a difficult early autumn. In late August, the company released data on its drug baricitnib, on which it partners with Eli Lilly (LLY). Though the study readout was positive, some analysts were not convinced that the drug could compete successfully.\n\nAnthem (ANTM)\n\nAnthem, the large health-insurance provider, is down 9.1% so far this month. The stock has been up and down this year, amid uncertainty over policy proposals in Washington, D.C. that could disrupt the managed- care industry.\n\nHumana (HUM)\n\nHumana, another health-insurance firm, is also down 9.1% this month. The company, a leading provider of Medicare Advantage plans, was among a number of health-insurance stocks that fell this month as chances of a victory by progressive Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren appeared to rise.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "Health care stocks have had a slow September.
