He refuses to take from people.\n\n\"He\u2019s always dancing, always joking and making light of everything. He\u2019s a bright light in everybody\u2019s life. I can\u2019t tell you the times he\u2019s had heart-to-heart talks with me this year talking to me about what my future holds. Regardless if I\u2019m doing well or doing bad, he\u2019s always there.
