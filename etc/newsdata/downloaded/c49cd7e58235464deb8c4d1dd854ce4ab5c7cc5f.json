Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) during a gun-safety forum in Las Vegas, Nev., October 2, 2019 (Steve Marcus/Reuters)\n\nSenator Kamala Harris is reportedly slashing her campaign staff and shifting her campaign strategy to focus almost solely on Iowa as her presidential bid struggles to remain afloat both financially and in the polls.\n\nDozens of aides will be laid off at the California senator\u2019s campaign headquarters in Baltimore, and others will be transferred to Iowa ahead of February\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses as the campaign upends its strategy, Politico reported.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, will see his $10,000 a month salary diminished, and other consultants will see their pay cut as well. Part of the campaign\u2019s new strategy involves conserving enough funds for a seven-figure media buy just before the Iowa caucuses.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of this campaign, Kamala Harris and this team set out with one goal \u2014 to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020. This requires us to make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in a memo.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign has floundered since a relatively strong launch on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Harris is currently at about 4.9 percent support and in fifth place among Democratic primary candidates nationally, according to RealClearPolitics poll average. In Iowa, she is at 2.7 percent support.", "description": "Senator Kamala Harris is reportedly slashing her campaign staff and shifting her campaign strategy to focus almost solely on Iowa as her presidential bid struggles to remain afloat both financially and in the polls.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Zachary Evans", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Frederick M.
