The last flight to repatriate Thomas Cook customers landed at Manchester Airport on Monday.\n\n'We've not been told anything'\n\nImage copyright SAMANTHAKENNEDY\n\nSamantha Kennedy, 34, from Alness in Scotland worked at an Inverness branch of Thomas Cook for six years.\n\nShe told the BBC that her WhatsApp chat group had been \"going crazy this morning since the media started reporting\" the deal.\n\n\"We've not been told anything. My manager hasn't been told anything. It would be absolutely amazing if it was true,\" she said.\n\nSamantha said she was sad the Thomas Cook brand had gone, but she loved worked in the industry.\n\n\"To continue to work in the industry would be amazing and there's not many travel shops in Inverness, so if Hays were to take over I think people would be pleased.\"\n\n'Deal with landlords'\n\nThe Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) union, which had members in Thomas Cook shops around the UK and in its head office in Peterborough, welcomed the move.\n\nManuel Cortes, TSSA's general secretary, said it offered \"real hope of reemployment to former Thomas Cook retail staff, many of whom are our members.\"\n\n\"We will now move swiftly to gather more details about the deal and are seeking an urgent meeting with Hays about the part our union can play in supporting what will be a significant expansion for them across our High Streets,\" he added.\n\nDavid Chapman, the Official Receiver, described the sale to Hays Travel as an \"important step\" in unravelling the finances of the 178-year-old chain.\n\nThe business is thought to have a licence for six months to occupy Thomas Cook stores, giving Hays time to strike new deals with landlords.\n\nIan Bell, head of travel and tourism at accountancy firm RSM, said it was a \"shrewd move\" for Hays, but would also represent a quadrupling of its travel agency stores at a time when customers are increasingly booking holidays online.\n\n\"Much may depend on the deals that Hays can strike with its new High Street landlords,\" said Mr Bell.\n\nAre you a Thomas Cook store employee?
