Christian Berg\n\nLocated on the central coast of Vietnam, Hoi An's Old Town is a heaven for photographers, foodies and architecture lovers.\n\nAdded to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1999, the former French colonial trade port has been one of the most commercially vital towns in Vietnam since the 16th century.\n\nAnd thanks to centuries as an important trade hub, the narrow streets of Old Town Hoi An feature rows and rows of charming mustard-hued merchant houses -- though many have since been transformed into low-key restaurants, bars, design boutiques and tailors' shops.\n\nAdding to the atmosphere, lush foliage spills from the rooftops and, come evening, romantic silk lanterns light up the town.\n\nWhile you're there, don't miss the array of delicious food experiences, from banh mi at ever-popular Banh Mi Phuong or local staples like herb-covered rice rolls, white rose dumplings and fresh seafood at Miss Ly's Cafe\n\nYufuin, Japan\n\nYufuin's quaint floral village. Shutterstock\n\nA tiny town in Oita Prefecture on Japan's southwestern Kyushu Island, Yufuin is best known for its peaceful atmosphere, onsen baths (hot springs), tile-roofed Japanese shophouses and pristine natural scenery, with Mount Yufu as a dramatic backdrop.\n\nIn autumn, travelers can expect an abundance of radiant orange and red leaves, while spring delivers soft and ethereal cherry blossoms galore.\n\nOnsens are another major draw. Travelers can experience them when staying in a ryokan (a local guesthouse), such as Yufuin Iyotomi, or in one of the public baths such as Shitanyu on Lake Kinrinko at the eastern edge of town.\n\nA stroll along Yunotsubo Street, which cuts neatly through the center of Yufuin, is a pleasant way to spend the morning thanks to countless artsy boutiques, tea shops and restaurants.\n\nRelated content 17 Japanese temples that enchant travelers\n\nCheese is particularly famous in this region, so we'd recommend a visit to Cheese Factory Yufuin (1101-6 Yufuincho Kawakami, Yufu) as well as a sampling of the crowd-pleasing cheesecake at the Milch Cafe dessert shop (3015-1 Yufuincho Kawakami Yufu).\n\nMeanwhile, art lovers will be spoiled for choice. There are more than 20 galleries in the tiny town, including the Kengo Kuma-designed Comico Art Museum Yufuin where multimedia works by prestigious Japanese talents such as Takashi Murakami and Hiroshi Sugimoto await.\n\nGeorge Town, Malaysia\n\nPenang's capital offers culture, cuisine and so much more.\n\nDesignated a UNESCO World Heritage site, the historic quarter of George Town in Penang, Malaysia, showcases multi-cultural influences.\n\nThe region's heritage can be traced back almost 500 years, when the former British colony was a prominent hub of trade on the Malacca Strait, enabling cultural exchange between Malay, Chinese, Indian and European residents.\n\nAs a result, George Town retains its unique character -- evidenced by the mix of pastel-painted shophouses and Chinese mansions, European government buildings, diverse religious buildings, festivals, music, food and fortresses.\n\nA roundup of the major landmarks includes Fort Cornwallis, St George's (the oldest Anglican church in Southeast Asia), Sri Mahamariamman Temple and the elaborate City Hall -- plus many travelers love to wander down Armenian Street to admire the old quarter's expressive street art.\n\nGeorge Town is considered the \"food capital of Malaysia\" and is one of the best food cities in Asia, so we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the hawker centers.\n\nPublic food centers like Sri Weld Food Court, New Lane Hawker Center and Cheapside Hawker Centre are so good, there's little motivation to set foot in a conventional restaurant while you're in town.\n\nLike the architecture, the local cuisine also captures George Town's multicultural history.\n\nMust-try dishes include char koay kak (rice cakes with eggs, prawns, bean sprouts and preserved radish), Hokkien mee (a mixed noodle dish with mixed seafood and soy sauce), rojak (a fruit and vegetable salad bathed in sweet peanut sauce), Assam laksa and kaya toast.\n\nCity of Vigan, Philippines\n\nVigan was established by the Spanish in 1572. Shutterstock\n\nOne of the best places to experience Spanish colonial-era architecture in Asia, the city of Vigan is situated on the western coast of Luzon island in northwestern Philippines.\n\nNow a UNESCO World Heritage City, Vigan was established by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nConquistador Juan de Salcedo developed a grid-like plan for the city, churches, schools and grand mansions with dazzling capiz-shell windows and dark wood interiors.\n\nRelated content 50 dishes that define the Philippines\n\nTravelers will find the vast majority of the colonial buildings around the central square, Plaza Salcedo, including the white and yellow St Paul's Cathedral. The beautiful Baroque structure was first built in 1641 and then restored after several earthquakes and fires.\n\nA short walk south, Calle Crisologo is another major landmark. The cobbled street features well-preserved heritage houses, alfresco bars and kalesa (horse-drawn carriages) that transport you back in time.\n\nWhile in Vigan, visitors may want to check out a pottery workshop such as RG Jar Factory (Liberation Boulevard), where you can try your hand at crafting a traditional earthen jar.\n\nMeanwhile, Vigan Public Market offers quotidian scenes and lots of food stalls hawking fresh and flaky empanadas.\n\nLuang Prabang, Laos\n\nThe former capital of Laos, beautiful Luang Prapang is home to colorful temples and dramatic natural scenery.\n\nOften hailed as one of the most spiritual places in Southeast Asia, Luang Prabang makes a dramatic first impression.\n\nSitting at the bottom of a valley in central Laos, the town is hugged by mountains while the Nam Khan River cuts through the center.\n\nServing as the seat of the first kingdom in Laos from the 14th to 16th centuries, Luang Prabang was long a strategic location on the Silk Route.\n\nIt was later taken by the French in the late 1890s and, over time, the harmonious intermingling of European and Laotian architecture created a distinct townscape.\n\nStill today, Luang Prabang, which was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995, continues to be the country's cultural and artistic capital.\n\nIn addition to the graceful architecture, Luang Prabang is also home to beautiful natural attractions, such as the three-tiered Kuang Si Waterfalls and Phousi Mountain, where 300-odd steps will lead you to a viewing platform to take in the countryside.\n\nThere are also more than 30 beautiful temples -- including the golden Wat Manorom, said to have been built in 1372 and considered the city's oldest temple -- not to mention the Royal Palace Museum, night markets, river boat rides, biking tours and more.\n\nKampot, Cambodia\n\nA serene coastal town, Kampot is most famous for its pepper. Shutterstock\n\nThough the first stop in Cambodia is usually Angkor Wat -- for good reason -- more and more travelers are falling for the charms of Kampot.\n\nBest known for its river scenery and pepper farms, the serene coastal town has garnered a reputation as one of the prettiest small towns in the region, thanks to colorful French colonial shophouses, pedestrian-friendly streets and plenty of outdoor activities.\n\nThe lengthy list covers everything from kayaking and biking to mountain treks, river cruises, paddleboarding and more.\n\nMeanwhile, a day trip through the countryside reveals lush paddy fields, cave temples, waterfalls, mirrored salt fields and pepper farms where you can sample the region's most famous -- and aromatic -- export.\n\nRelated content 7 of Cambodia's best islands\n\nFor those seeking a blissful beach holiday, the stunning nearby islands await.\n\nKota Gede, Indonesia\n\nKotagede's Gate of The Kings Tomb. Shutterstock\n\nAmong the oldest neighborhoods in Yogyakarta, Kota Gede is known for its silver industry, little lanes and photogenic architecture.\n\nThe beautiful setting can be traced to the 15th century, when the \"Big City\" served as the seat of the Mataram Sultanate -- the final independent kingdom before the Dutch colonized Java island.\n\nAt the time, many wealthy merchants built palatial homes in the Kalang style -- an eclectic, enclosed house that features a mix of Dutch structural elements, traditional Javanese layouts and ornate details.\n\nLater, in the early 1900s, silverworking had become one of the area's most important trades.\n\nStill today, travelers wandering along the main streets of Jalan Kemasan will find dozens of boutiques, galleries and workshops that showcases everything from jewelry to boxes to tableware.\n\nFor a little history, travelers can visit the 17th-century Kotagede Mosque and the Imogiri Graveyard where the former ruler is buried.\n\nWith Kota Gede as a homebase, it's easy to visit Yogya's UNESCO-listed landmarks such as the sculptural Prambanan Temple, an important Hindu site dating to the ninth century, and the eighth-century Borobudur Temple -- said to be the largest Buddhist monument in the world.\n\nThen there's the Parangkusumo sand dunes, Jomblang Cave and several inviting beaches. In other words: you'll need more than a weekend to explore.\n\nGalle, Sri Lanka\n\nGalle Fort is a UNESCO world heritage site and well-known tourist attraction. ISHARA S.KODIKARA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSitting on the southwestern coast of Sri Lanka, the walled town of Galle owes its historic atmosphere to many centuries as an important trade port.\n\nThe UNESCO-listed fortress has lived through three rounds of colonial rulers -- beginning with the Portuguese from 1505-1658, then the Dutch from 1658-1796 and, finally, the British from 1796-1948.\n\nThese days, many of the old warehouses and merchant houses have been converted into museums, boutique stays, shops, restaurants and bars.\n\nThe dining scene is particularly exciting, with highlights including popular Fort Printers -- built inside an 18th-century mansion and known for its fresh seafood -- or Hoppa for excellent Sri Lankan curries and egg hoppers (dome-like pancakes).\n\nRelated content How to explore Sri Lanka's southern coast in style\n\nAs for landmarks, you can see all of the major highlights easily on foot. There's the Dutch Reformed Church (aka De Groote Kerk), Galle Clock Tower, Galle Lighthouse, Meeran Mosque, Sudharmalaya Temple and the old Spice Warehouse, just to name a few.\n\nAfter exploring the colonial town, travelers can easily trace the southern coastline to join a surf camp, diving expedition, whale-watching trip or simply laze around at beautiful Unawatuna Beach.\n\nZhouzhuang, China\n\nHistoric Zhouzhuang is home to several ancient sites. Shutterstock\n\nWhile Suzhou, west of Shanghai, might steal the limelight as the most famous water town in China, Zhouzhuang is said to be China's oldest.\n\nBuilt over 900 years ago during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the beautiful river town feels like a living museum -- picture whitewashed Chinese houses, quiet canals and arched stone bridges that would fit perfectly in a landscape painting.\n\nRelated content China's 5 most beautiful water towns\n\nZhouzhuang is home to several ancient sites, including the more than 500-year-old Twin Bridges -- Shide and Yong'an -- the 11th-century Chengxu Taoist Temple and several wealthy merchant houses.\n\nAmong the top choices is the Qing Dynasty-style Shen House complex -- a vast Chinese mansion with more than 100 rooms, as well as elaborate gold carvings, quiet gardens and ancient furniture.\n\nIt's worth noting that Zhouzhuang can be very crowded on weekends. For the most elbow room and best photo opportunities, we'd recommend visiting on a weekday in the spring or fall.\n\nMawlynnong, India\n\nThe unspoilt forests of Meghalaya, India are home to a marvel of human ingenuity: the living root bridges.\n\nMawlynnong, located in the East Khasi Hills of northeastern India, has been named the \"Cleanest Village in Asia\" by various publications.\n\nThe village lives up to its reputation thanks to the Khasi families -- a matrilineal, ethnic community -- who call the town home and take great pride in keeping their village pristine.\n\nThey also cultivate abundant, meticulously pruned gardens that are famous across India.\n\nAs you might expect in the region's cleanest city, natural beauty is a major draw.\n\nTravelers can soak it up at Sky View -- a popular 85-foot-tall tree house made of bamboo that overlooks the jungle canopies all the way across the plains of Bangladesh to the south.\n\nAlso nearby, find the Mawlynnong Waterfall, while the living root bridges create an ethereal sylvan scene. They're pretty much what they sounds like: natural bridges formed by weaving together the roots of rubber trees.\n\nOver the course of about 15 years, they grew across waterways and became strong enough for people to walk on them.\n\nGhandruk, Nepal\n\nTake a 60 second vacation in Nepal where the stunning Himalayan mountain range is a huge draw for adventure tourists.\n\nA mountain village in the Himalayan region of Nepal, Ghandruk (also known as Stone Village) sits more than 2,000 meters above sea level.\n\nOnly accessible on foot, the village is about a five-hour hike from Pokhara, a lakeside city in central Nepal that serves as a starting point for the popular Annapurna Circuit.\n\nGhandruk welcomes hikers with traditional tea houses, a mountain-top temple, horseback riding and cultural experiences which provide a peek into the lifestyle and customs of the Gurung people who reside here.\n\nMembers of this Nepalese tribe have served in the British Army's Gurkha regiments during many conflicts and there's a museum in the village which provides lots of fascinating cultural and historical insights.\n\nIt's a place you could stay for a few hours or a few days, to soak up the traditional atmosphere and admire the Himalayan scenery -- with Mount Annapurna, Machhapuchhre and Himalchuli all within view.\n\nRelated content Best places to visit for the ultimate Asia experience\n\nSai Kung, Hong Kong\n\nThe town of Sai Kung in the New Territories of Hong Kong is lined with seafood restaurants.

Shutterstock\n\nThough most famous for its beaches, the Thai island of Phuket offers ample opportunities for cultural immersion as well.\n\nThe historic old quarter of Phuket Town, located in the center of the island, is lined with Sino-Colonial style shophouses, built during the island's tin-mining boom of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThere are plenty of hip shops, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and bars, including the batik shops along Thalang Road run by ethnic Malays and Indians.
