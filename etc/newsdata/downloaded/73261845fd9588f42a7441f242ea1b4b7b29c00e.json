Key interest rates are currently at minus 0.4 percent and have been since 2016.\n\nInvestors are forecasting about a 50 percent chance of a 0.2 percentage-point rate cut.\n\n\u201cThe ECB\u2019s monetary policy is doing its duty, but it can\u2019t do everything,\u201d Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd it certainly can\u2019t perform miracles.\n\nWhatever policymakers ultimately decide, however, could shed some light onto the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-setting meeting next week -- and whether the U.S. central bank will lower the benchmark federal funds rate by a modest 25 basis points, or leave it unchanged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign central banks often influence decision-making at the Fed; in fact, Chairman Jerome Powell frequently cites weak global growth as a threat to economic growth in the U.S.\n\n\u201cU.S. rates can diverge to some extent from global rates but there\u2019s a limit to how far that process can go, because of integrated capital markets,\u201d Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida recently told Fox Business.\n\nThe concern is that if the U.S. didn\u2019t send its rates lower alongside the ECB, it could lose demand to Europe, putting downward pressure on inflation and overall economic growth. It\u2019s also one of the reasons that President Trump frequently complains that rates are too high in the U.S.\n\n\u201cMario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come, which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cThey have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.\u201d\n\nA television monitor on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange headlines the rate decision of the Federal Reserve, Wednesday, July 31, 2019.
