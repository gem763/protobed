With Joker, Joaquin Phoenix is a certified graduate of the Acme Academy of Dramatic Arts. You want acting? Come and get it.\n\nSkills on display include but are not limited to leering, jeering, airhorn-style blasts of laughter timed for maximum audience discomfort, funky-chicken style dance moves, the occasional blank, dead stare and assorted moony expressions indicating soulful lonerism.\n\nBut don\u2019t for a minute think Phoenix isn\u2019t funny, too. They say you never forget Clowning 101, and Phoenix hasn\u2019t: He hops around like an unhinged Emmett Kelly, twisting his physique into weird and unsettling shapes. His body has a rubbery angularity, like a chicken bone soaked in Coca-Cola.\n\nIn Joker \u2014 playing in competition here at the Venice Film Festival \u2014 Phoenix is acting so hard you can feel the desperation throbbing in his veins. He leaves you wanting to start him a GoFundMe, so he won\u2019t have to pour so much sweat into his job again. But the aggressive terribleness of his performance isn\u2019t completely his fault. (He has often been, and generally remains, a superb actor. Just not here.)\n\nDirector Todd Phillips \u2014 who made frat-boy comedies like Road Trip and Old School before graduating to dude-bro comedies like The Hangover movies \u2014 bears at least some of the blame, and the aggressive and possibly irresponsible idiocy of Joker overall is his alone to answer for. Phillips may want us to think he\u2019s giving us a movie all about the emptiness of our culture, but really, he\u2019s just offering a prime example of it.\n\nJoker is a stand-alone origin story that dovetails with, but does not strictly follow, DC Universe Batman lore. Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck \u2014 he\u2019ll later become one of Batman\u2019s nemeses, the Joker, in case you didn\u2019t already know that \u2014 is an odd, lonely guy who lives at home with the mother (played by a wan Frances Conroy) he love-hates.\n\nArthur works for a sad rent-a-clown joint, and nothing ever goes right. This is clear from the moment we meet him: he\u2019s tense and nervous and he can\u2019t relax. The movie is set in a Gotham City that\u2019s a lazy approximation of gritty 1970s-era New York, complete with garbage strikes and \u201csuper-rats\u201d overrunning the city. On the job in clown costume, Arthur gets beaten up by a mob of nasty punks \u2014 and then almost gets fired because they stole and broke the \u201cgoing out of business sign\u201d he was twirling for a client.\n\nMore bad stuff happens, day in, day out. He gets angrier and more isolated by the minute. No one is ever kind to Arthur; he\u2019s the world\u2019s saddest punching bag.\n\nWhen the city\u2019s social services close down, he can no longer receive counseling there, or get his meds. (He carries around a little laminated card that he holds out helpfully whenever he laughs inappropriately, which is pretty much all the time. It reads, \u201cForgive my laughter, I have a brain injury.\u201d) The one bright spot of his day, or night, is watching a Johnny Carson-style talk-show host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), on television. He dreams of being a stand-up comic and someday being on the show. His wish will come true, but life will have beaten the poor lad down interminably before then.\n\nRead more: Here Are All the Upcoming Joker Movies\n\nAs you can probably guess, all of Arthur\u2019s travails are leading up to a series of \u201cSee what you made me do?\u201d brutalities, most of which happen while he\u2019s dressed up in his clown suit. Violence makes him feel more in control, less pathetic. Killing \u2014 usually with a gun, but scissors or a good old-fashioned suffocation will do just fine \u2014 empowers him.\n\nBut it\u2019s not as if we don\u2019t know how this pathology works: In America, there\u2019s a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week. And yet we\u2019re supposed to feel some sympathy for Arthur, the troubled lamb; he just hasn\u2019t had enough love. Before long, he becomes a vigilante folk hero \u2014 his first signature act is to kill a trio of annoying Wall Street spuds while riding the subway, which inspires the masses to don clown masks and march enthusiastically around the city with \u201cKill the Rich!\u201d placards.\n\nArthur also tries to work out a personal beef with rich asshat and aspiring city mayor Thomas Wayne, father of you-know-who. Because, it turns out, Arthur has some daddy issues too. Who would have guessed?\n\nZazie Beetz, Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips attend a photocall for the film \"Joker\" on August 31, 2019 during the 76th Venice Film Festival. ALBERTO PIZZOLI\u2014AFP/Getty Images\n\nJoker \u2014 which was written by Phillips and Scott Silver \u2014 doesn\u2019t have a plot; it\u2019s more like a bunch of reaction GIFs strung together. When Arthur gets fired from his clown job, he struts by the time-clock, deadpans, \u201cOh no, I forgot to punch out\u201d and then, wait for it, socks it so hard it dangles from the wall. Make a note of the moment, because you\u2019ll be seeing it a lot in your Twitter and Facebook feeds.\n\nThe movie\u2019s cracks \u2014 and it\u2019s practically all cracks \u2014 are stuffed with phony philosophy. Joker is dark only in a stupidly adolescent way, but it wants us to think it\u2019s imparting subtle political or cultural wisdom. Just before one of his more violent tirades, Arthur muses, \u201cEverybody just screams at each other. Nobody\u2019s civil anymore.\u201d Who doesn\u2019t feel that way in our terrible modern times? But Arthur\u2019s observation is one of those truisms that\u2019s so true it just slides off the wall, a message that both the left and the right can get behind and use for their own aims. It means nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, the movie lionizes and glamorizes Arthur even as it shakes its head, faux-sorrowfully, over his violent behavior. There\u2019s an aimless subplot involving a neighbor in Arthur\u2019s apartment building, played by Zazie Beetz, in an underdeveloped role. (Beetz also appears in another movie here at the festival, Benedict Andrews\u2019s Seberg, where she\u2019s given much more to do.) Arthur has a crush on her, and though he does her no harm, there\u2019s still something creepily entitled about his attentiveness to her. He could easily be adopted as the patron saint of incels.\n\nArthur is a mess, but we\u2019re also supposed to think he\u2019s kind of great \u2014 a misunderstood savant. Dressed up for his big TV moment in a turquoise paisley shirt, marigold vest and dapper cranberry suit (admittedly a marvelous feat of costume design), Arthur struts down an outdoor stairway like a rock\u2019n\u2019roll hero. It\u2019s the most energizing moment in the movie, but what is it winding us up for? Arthur inspires chaos and anarchy, but the movie makes it look like he\u2019s starting a revolution, where the rich are taken down, the poor get everything they need and deserve, and the sad guys who can\u2019t get a date become killer heroes. There\u2019s a sick joke in there somewhere. Unfortunately, it\u2019s on us.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Joker is an origin story that dovetails with, but does not strictly follow, DC Universe Batman lore.
