He was dropped as the writer of the forthcoming film \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX\u201d when the director was replaced. And h e wrote the book for the big-budget stage adaptation of \u201cKing Kong,\u201d which was poorly reviewed and closed as a flop on Broadway, although the producers are hoping to revivify the musical in Shanghai.\n\n\u201cIt was really, really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like there was a sort of presumption that we were commercial sellouts \u2014 you were aware that you were walking into a town that didn\u2019t like you very much.\u201d But he is also self-critical. \u201cThere were things about the show that didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that I panicked, because the first previews didn\u2019t work at all, and I didn\u2019t stay true to what I was trying to do. Probably I should have done something more radical and clever.\u201d\n\n\u2018I was quite seriously ill\u2019\n\nHe grew up in Bristol and Newbury, England; his father was a town planner, and his mother worked with adults who had learning disabilities. His parents were politically active Laborites. \u201cWe were always going on marches,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe end of history \u2026\u201d is about an argumentative family with zealously left-leaning parents who are not happy with their children\u2019s lack of political engagement. Mr. Thorne, who as a younger man was active in the Labor Party but is now disenchanted and uninvolved, called the play \u201ca complicated love note.\u201d\n\nHe was, by his own description, an unhappy child, but he was a voracious, and precocious, reader, who tore through so many books that at 8, after reading all the age-appropriate material his mother brought for him on a family vacation, he read her copy of \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d\n\nHis parents were also heavily into what the British call amateur dramatics \u2014 both of them performed in community theater, and his father wrote pantomimes and directed. Young Jack dreamed of being actor, before concluding that he was not good at it. (Among his last appearances: in the mini-series \u201cThis Is England,\u201d which he wrote with Shane Meadows, \u201cI played a part called Carrotbum, so-called because he once had a carrot stuffed up his bum, and Shane said he couldn\u2019t find anyone else lonely or weird enough to do it.\u201d)\n\nHe describes writing as an accidental discovery. While a student at Cambridge, he had wanted to direct, but couldn\u2019t afford the stage rights to plays, so he decided to write his own material. \u201cIt was drivel,\u201d he said. \u201cI was quite seriously ill, and I was very self-absorbed in my self-pity.\u201d", "description": "Eccentric and prodigious, the writer Jack Thorne won a Tony for \u201cCursed Child.\u201d Up next: \u201cSunday\u201d at the Atlantic Theater Company, and \u201cHis Dark Materials\u201d on HBO.", "authors": ["Michael Paulson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/arts/08thorne-promo/08thorne2-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
