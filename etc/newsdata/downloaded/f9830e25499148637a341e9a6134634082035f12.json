(Kelli Maple/YouTube)\n\nThe fact that personalized ads will be blocked on videos about kids' toys, games or characters could \u201cruin\u201d careers, said American YouTuber Kelli Maple in a video posted on her channel on Sept. 7.\n\nThe 17-year-old, who started her self-titled channel in 2014 as a way to express her love for dolls, said she had hoped to turn her passion into a career and \u201cnow that\u2019s not even an option.\u201d\n\nWhy advertising matters\n\nCareer YouTubers \u201ccan\u2019t survive\u201d without ads, said Latoya Moore-Broyles, one of the creative brains behind MyFroggyStuff. \u201cWe have to have houses and food.\u201d\n\nIn a video posted on Sept. 6, the mother-daughter team announced \u201cthe channel is maturing\u201d in order to keep the ads flowing.\n\nThat means no more unboxing toys or building miniature sets for dolls \u2014 but videos about crafting, upcycling and even hair care will continue.\n\nThe team behind the MyFroggyStuff channel says their content is maturing in order to make it easier to earn money from ads under new rules. That means they\u2019ll no longer go by their nicknames: Froggy and Little Froggy. They\u2019ll go by Toya and Bella instead. (MyFroggyStuff/YouTube)\n\nYouTube collects personal information about its users \u2014 including their likes and dislikes \u2014 for a number of reasons, one of which is to figure out which ads they might like.\n\nBut collecting personal information about kids without clear permission from their parents is illegal in the U.S.\n\nSo why was YouTube breaking the rules?\n\nYouTube\u2019s response\n\nThe platform was never meant for users under the age of 13, said YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki in a blog post dated Sept. 4.\n\nBut with a \u201cboom\u201d in family content coming online in recent years, she said it was time to take a \u201chard look\u201d at what more YouTube could do to protect kids\u2019 privacy.\n\nIn a blog post, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki explained the company will use machine learning (a computer program that can learn from experience) to decide which videos are targeting kids and should have their ads blocked. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)\n\nThe $170 million US fine might have had something to do with motivating YouTube to make changes \u2014 though Valerie Steeves, a criminology professor at the University of Ottawa, called it a \u201cminor\u201d fine \u201cgiven the amount of money that YouTube makes.\u201d\n\nWhy should kids care?\n\nThe private information that YouTube collects can have a real impact on your future, Steeves said.\n\n\n\nYouTube tracks all kinds of details in order to build a profile on you, including what kind of music you like, your favourite food, who your friends are and where you live.\n\nUntil 2020 when the changes kick in, YouTube is pushing kids under 13 to use the YouTube kids app, which doesn\u2019t include targeted ads. (YouTube Kids)\n\nThey can sell that profile to people who make ads, possible employers and even the police \u2014 and that can have an impact on your future opportunities, Steeves said, including whether you get a job, qualify for life insurance or get parole if you end up in jail.\n\nSure, you get to watch some good videos \u2014 for free \u2014 on YouTube, Steeves said, but it\u2019s \u201can unfair exchange.\u201d\n\nWhile you wait\n\nYouTube is giving creators \u201cabout four months\u201d before the changes kick in, Wojcicki.\n\nThe company is also setting up a $100 million US fund \u2014 to be used over the next three years \u2014 to make \u201cthoughtful, original children\u2019s content,\u201d she said.\n\nFor users who don\u2019t want to wait for more privacy, YouTube is suggesting they use the YouTube kids app, which doesn\u2019t include targeted ads and which comes ad-free if you pay for a membership.", "description": "An investigation in the U.S. means more privacy for kid users on YouTube.
