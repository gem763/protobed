The show, from executive producer Dick Wolf, of \u201cLaw & Order\u201d fame, explores the dark world of contract killings, highlighting some of the most shocking murder-for-hire cases ever caught on tape from across the country.\n\nWYOMING MAN RECALLS EX-WIFE'S ATTEMPT TO HIRE A HIT MAN IN NEW DOC: 'I DON'T THINK SHE HAS REMORSE'\n\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d Dippolito told Fox News. \u201cI couldn\u2019t catch her doing anything. But I had my eye on her and I had a good suspicion\u2026 I\u2019m not oblivious to what\u2019s going on around me, but who wants to immediately think it\u2019s your girl or your wife? That\u2019s just not a natural reaction\u2026 But I was praying it wasn\u2019t her.\u201d\n\nDippolito is aware that his story is unusual, even from the beginning. Before his newlywed spouse, now 36, was trying to have him killed, the pair met in October 2008 while she was working as a professional escort.\n\n\u201cI did order an escort,\u201d Dippolito admitted. \u201cIt was weird. I had a connection with her immediately. She was uncomfortable, I was uncomfortable. She\u2019s doing something she shouldn\u2019t be doing and I\u2019m doing something I shouldn\u2019t be doing. But we still had that moment where it was just two regular people getting along. And there was a connection. It was more than what we were doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the second time we met, we got along extremely well,\" he continued. \"It seemed like we had the same goals in mind. I was heading towards doing things I\u2019ve been trying to do and she told me she was a real estate agent. Everything was just going well, or so it seemed.\u201d\n\nTED BUNDY SURVIVORS RECALL SERIAL KILLER'S BRUTALITY ON 'DR. OZ': \u2018MOST OF MY BONES WERE BROKEN IN MY FACE\u2019\n\nIn February 2009, four months after Dalia showed up at Dippolito\u2019s door, the couple married.\n\n\u201cI remember we were out having lunch and we were like, \u2018Why don\u2019t we just get married?\u2019\u201d Dippolito explained. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s the difference? Let\u2019s just do it.\u2019 I wanted to get married, but\u2026 I should have gone a lot slower.\"\n\nDippolito said he was eager to have a fresh start after dealing with his own legal troubles. In 2009, Broward Palm Beach New Times reported Dippolito ran a telemarketing business that preyed on strangers, convincing them to invest in the foreign currency options market of 2001.\n\nCourt documents showed Dippolito\u2019s companies collected more than $200,000 in about 11 months. The outlet shared that by February 2002, customers started complaining to the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While investors were told they made a profit, Dippolito never wired their earnings.\n\n'THE DEVIL YOU KNOW' EXPLORES SELF-PROCLAIMED SATANIST WHO SUFFERED 'SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES'\n\nDippolito was arrested on March 2002 and pleaded guilty to charges of organized fraud and unlicensed telemarketing. He was sentenced to two years in state prison but served seven months for the time he spent in jail awaiting trial. He was ordered to pay restitution every month to his victims.\n\n\u201cI paid every penny back that I was supposed to pay,\u201d said Dippolito. \u201cI did everything I said I was going to do. That\u2019s what made these past 10 years harder.\"\n\nThe seemingly blissful, whirlwind marriage Dippolito happily dived into went crashing fast. The South Florida Sun Sentinal reported Dippolito accused Dalia of making off with $100,000 of his savings intended as restitution payments for his victims. Dalia also convinced Dippolito to give her sole ownership of his house.\n\nAccording to police records, Dalia was planting drugs in Dippolito\u2019s car in a failed attempt to get his probation revoked, the outlet shared. Then, detectives said, she tried to have Dippolito killed.\n\nThe documentary showed Dalia told former lover Mohamed Shihadeh she wanted her husband dead and was ready to hire a hit man to do the deed. A concerned Shihadeh then contacted Boynton Beach Police to reveal Dalia\u2019s plot. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported Shihadeh immediately began to work for investigators as an informant.\n\n\u2018HOMICIDE HUNTER\u2019 STAR LT. JOE KENDA REVEALS THE ONE CASE THAT HAUNTS HIM THE MOST\n\nDalia wound up meeting a hit man \u2013 who actually was an undercover cop \u2013 and insisted she was \u201clike 5,000 percent sure\u201d she wanted Dippolito gone for good. Dalia agreed to pay the undercover officer, Widy Jean, $7,000. She also discussed various plots before Jean said he would kill her husband at the couple\u2019s home, making it look like a botched burglary while she was at the gym.\n\n\u201cHalf of me was relieved,\u201d said Dippolito, explaining his missing savings and the drugs found in his car finally made sense. \u201cI just knew it. But the other half of me was scared to death. Because what\u2019s going to happen to me now?\u201d\n\nThe documentary revealed police kept Dippolito safe as they staged a murder scene at the couple\u2019s home. Video footage showed officers confronting Dalia, who believed her husband was fatally shot. As Dalia was taken away, Boynton Beach Police posted the video on YouTube where it quickly went viral, the outlet shared\n\nGEORGIA MAN WHO CONFESSED TO MURDERING BUSINESS PARTNER WAS DRIVEN BY GREED FROM POULTRY BUSINESS: DOC\n\nDippolito vividly remembered the moment when he finally confronted Dalia.\n\n\u201cI told her, \u2018You\u2019re caught,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201c\u2026 She just kept lying. I actually started laughing right in front of her. Maybe I felt like crying, but I laughed. I thought maybe the law would crack her, but it didn\u2019t. She just kept lying to my face. But I finally caught her red-handed.\u201d\n\nProsecutors believed Dalia wanted control of the couple\u2019s Palm Beach County townhouse and his savings. But a 2011 conviction and a 20-year sentence were thrown out on appeal. Then a 2016 retrial ended with a hung jury.\n\nDippolito said that while he was the victim in this case, he was painted out as a criminal during the lengthy trials.\n\n\u2018DEADLY WOMEN\u2019 HOST CANDICE DELONG SAYS FEW ARE \u2018BORN EVIL,\u2019 BELIEVES THERE ARE MORE UNDISCOVERED FEMALE KILLERS\n\n\u201cAt the time, I was trying to pay my victims back,\u201d he explained. \u201cDalia was trying to steal my money and have me killed. I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. I was making my payments \u2014 my full payments. And I haven\u2019t been in trouble once since then\u2026 My mother just passed away this year. She probably had like three nervous breakdowns over this.\u201d\n\nDalia was finally convicted in 2017 and given a 16-year sentence for soliciting first-degree murder. She is currently held at a women's prison in central Florida.\n\nDippolito said he\u2019s determined to build a new life for himself, one that is scandal-free. He recently earned his real estate license and said he paid off his debts. Now, Dippolito said, he can \u201cstart living.\u201d\n\n\u201cI finally got my freedom back,\u201d said Dippolito. \u201c.. I have no legal issues. [But] I\u2019m disappointed [Dalia] was so dumb to do what she did. Stealing is bad enough, but you\u2019re going to kill me over it? You could have hired a lawyer and moved out\u2026 You would have gotten half of what we had and everybody would have gone their separate ways\u2026 I just feel bad that she didn\u2019t have enough sense. It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s so stupid. I don\u2019t know, I probably would have just given her the money. It\u2019s just insane.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nDippolito knows he\u2019s made plenty of his mistakes in his life. He hopes his story on \u201cMurder for Hire\u201d will serve as a warning.\n\n\u201cIf anybody is watching, don\u2019t do anything so dumb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it\u2026 Have you not watched these shows?
