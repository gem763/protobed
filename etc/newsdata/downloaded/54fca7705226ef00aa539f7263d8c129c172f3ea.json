City Press will be running \u2013 or walking \u2013 for this important cause. Join us. Here\u2019s what it is all about.\n\nNappy Run, which this year coincides with National Children\u2019s Day, raises awareness and funds for children with disabilities. It was started in 2011 by the National Council of and for Persons with Disabilities.\n\nThe campaign is primarily aimed at educating the public the rights of our country\u2019s most marginalised and vulnerable group of people \u2013 children with disabilities. Furthermore, the Nappy Run appeals to the public for online donations which go towards the purchase of nappies \u2013 a vital incontinence-management product for children with disabilities.\n\nThe double jeopardy\n\n\n\nIn South Africa, the reality for most children with disabilities is that they live at or below the national poverty line. This double jeopardy \u2013 being poor and having a disability \u2013 often spirals families into a cycle of compounded marginalisation, from which escape requires intervention towards poverty reduction and disability inclusion.\n\nLiving in poverty restricts access to everything from housing, travel, food, healthcare and education. For those who have a disability, these challenges are further compounded by several factors that mainstream society is generally unaware of. This worsens marginalisation. Living on the periphery of society and being excluded from many opportunities, services and facilities available in mainstream society is exacerbated when people are poor and have a disability.\n\nThe cost of being poor with a disability\n\nTake, for example, children who need the use of a wheelchair. Being dependent on a wheelchair requires access to customised toilets and showers. But as a result of living \u201cbelow the breadline\u201d, their accommodation doesn\u2019t even have basic ablution facilities.\n\nUsing any type of public transport is an ongoing struggle: taxis are often reluctant to transport these children since they have to be helped load the wheelchair, which they have to pay for because it takes up space. For caregivers with limited funds, this is a financial burden.\n\nRedressing this marginalisation is a primary function of organisations such as the National Council of and for Persons with Disabilities.\n\n\u201cIt costs families or caregivers money to travel to rehabilitation sessions, while those in rural communities can see occupational or physiotherapists in clinics only once a month, if they are lucky.\n\n\u201cThese children often do not have access to mainstream day-care facilities or schools, relying on community-based and volunteer driven day-care centres with limited resources.\n\n\u201cExcluded from a chance at receiving a good education, these children will continue to be marginalised as the poorest and most exposed in society,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 Kalis, specialist: advocacy, policy and children\u2019s matters at the council.\n\nHowever, it need not be this way. The council, alongside other advocacy and lobby organisations, have called on government to break this cycle of compounded marginalisation.\n\n\u201cThe government must strive towards an inclusive budget that takes the extra cost drivers of children with disabilities into account. This would require a coordinated effort from different departments, including the department of basic education, the department of health, the department of human settlements and the department of transport,\u201d said Kalis.\n\nNappies \u2013 a saving grace\n\nFor children with disabilities and their carers, any form of help received counts as a blessing. Simple items such as nappies make a major difference. Nappies are a necessity for many children who have a disability, since incontinence is a reality for them. However, the cost of nappies is often too high for families, carers or centres, to bear \u2013 even though the department of health is constitutionally obliged to provide nappies, an essential health item. Children with disabilities deserve a comfortable life like every other child. They deserve dignity and hygienic conditions.\n\nThe Nappy Run\n\nThis is where the annual Nappy Run campaign plays an important role. The campaign, started in 2011 by the National Council of and for Persons with Disabilities, is primarily aimed at educating the public on the violation of the rights of our country\u2019s most marginalised and vulnerable group of people \u2013 children with disabilities. It\u2019s also used to appeal for online donations to raise cash to buy nappies.\n\nTaking place from October 3 to December 3 \u2013 the International Day for Persons with Disabilities \u2013 the campaign peaks with a 5km fun run, walk or wheel event at the Joburg Zoo on Saturday November 2, coinciding with National Children\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cSupporting initiatives such as the Nappy Run shows much needed solidarity for children with disabilities and the problems they continually face. Contributing to the cause, in any small way, will go a long way in the effort required to break the cycle of compounded marginalisation of being poor and having disabilities,\u201d said Kalis.", "description": "On November 2, at the Johannesburg Zoo, the annual Nappy Run takes place.
