(TT News Agency/via REUTERS).\n\nThe Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to three physician-scientists from the U.S. and Britain \u2014 William G. Kaelin Jr, Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza \u2014 \u201cfor their discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\u201d\n\nThe fundamental discoveries by the trio illuminated what the Nobel committee called \u201cone of life\u2019s most essential adaptive processes\u201d \u2014 how cells detect and respond to changes in oxygen levels, which is necessary for life and used to convert food into energy. Their work helps explain how, at high altitudes, the body adapts to thinner air by sending signals to generate more red blood cells to carry oxygen.\n\nRandall Johnson, a member of the Nobel committee, said the discoveries have implications in medicine for treating anemia, cancer and other diseases. But more fundamentally, he compared the molecular machinery the scientists discovered to a switch that ensures that the body always has the right level of oxygen.\n\n\u201cThe prize is for this \u2026 rheostat or thermostat of the oxygen levels \u2014 a damper that you\u2019d have on your furnace to let in more or less oxygen at any given time so that it\u2019s just right, so that the flame burns just right,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBREAKING NEWS:\n\nThe 2019 #NobelPrize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded jointly to William G.

Semenza is a scientist at Johns Hopkins University. Ratcliffe is director of clinical research at the Francis Crick Institute in London.\n\nAll three were notified by phone call of their prize Monday morning, according to Thomas Perlmann of the Nobel committee. Ratcliffe was \u201cthe most awake person,\u201d reached in his office, Perlmann said. Semenza was woken by the early morning call, before dawn on Monday.\n\nPerlmann said that the committee didn\u2019t have a phone number for Kaelin, and first called his sister to find out how to reach him. She provided two numbers \u2014 the first one a wrong number. When the committee finally reached Kaelin, \u201che was really happy, almost speechless,\u201d Perlmann said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Carolyn Y.
