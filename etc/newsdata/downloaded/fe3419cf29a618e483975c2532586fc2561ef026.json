I doubt they have much ammunition left,\" he said.\n\n\"JCap and WiseTech may continue to argue about the fine details of the allegations but it looks like neither is prepared to concede any ground and earnings guidance has been made.\"\n\nMr James, who is the most bearish of the local analysts, said WiseTech's half-year results in February would be the next major event for the firm, but speculated that there could be a period of uncertainty and volatility in its share price until then.\n\nJCap had claimed that WiseTech's acquisitons had resulted in lower revenue from these businesses and customers leaving for competitors. But WiseTech asserted that its deals were not \"revenue rollups\" \u2013 rather they were done to \"amplify knowledge, resources and access to new key markets\".\n\nMr White acknowledged that not all of its deals had been star performers, but he said none had been disasters.\n\n\"It would be rude to suggest there's no performance difference between the 33 acquisitions, but none have failed,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A couple get a bit excited at the beginning and run around the paddock too fast and then get tired and come back to home base and say 'can you give us some help'. Others stream along ... [like] Pierbridge, which is a fantastic business ... or Trinium, which is an unbelievably good business.\n\n\"But not everyone turns up at the front of the class and gets As.\"\n\nSince listing in 2016, the company has spent more than $400 million on 33 acquisitions. Its largest was the $92 million purchase of Singaporean business Containerchain in February, but most of its deals are only a few million dollars.\n\nIt can\u2019t be a system used as a battering ram to win someone else a grand prize for distorting the facts. \u2014 Richard White, WiseTech\n\nWiseTech chief growth officer Gail Williamson said the the basis of the company's acquisition strategy was to buy small assets, adding skilled people with local knowledge and regulatory experience in new geographies.\n\n\"We're not buying another big problem, we're buying things that are removing the risk for our business.\"\n\nJCap's reports also alleged the company had utilised an audit loophole to inflate its revenue and disguised the amount of organic revenue versus acquired revenue. It also claimed customers were unhappy with WiseTech's software and its customer attrition rate was higher than the 1 per cent WiseTech has stated. WiseTech rejected all of these claims and said they could mislead and manipulate the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report also claimed that only six of the top 25 global freight forwarders were users of CargoWise One, but the company refuted this and said 22 used the software, although some were only in the early stages.\n\nIn only a few hours of trade on Thursday and Monday morning, the allegations knocked about 21 per cent off the company's share price and $2.4 billion off its valuation.\n\nMr White is the largest shareholder in the business by some margin, owning more than 48 per cent of the company. He personally took a $1.2 billion hit from the JCap attack.\n\nBlue Ocean Equities analyst Stuart Turner said he was confident the JCap allegations would come to nothing.\n\n\"It's unfortunate for people who got scared out of their shareholding and sold at too low a price,\" he said. \"WiseTech does a very good job of explaining its business plan and its annual report this year was a tour de force of disclosure.\n\n\"Nothing in either JCap report would lead me to change anything in my most recent research report or my $35.40 price target.\"\n\nOn Wednesday WiseTech reiterated its 2020 financial year guidance, as set in August, of revenue growth of 26-32 per cent (a range of $440-460 million) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $145-153 million, representing growth of 34-42 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile WiseTech rejected all of JCap's claims, it did not deny the complexity of its business, saying it was not like other software-as-a-service companies.\n\nWhile Mr White said the company worked hard to \"make complex things simple\", he said the company's core software could be thought of in similar regard to Bloomberg \u2013 a complicated system.\n\n\"It's not like a CommSec application where someone's mother can get on the screen and make a simple trade ... it's a complex business and it's a complex system because of that business,\" he said.\n\nRichard White accuses JCap of not wanting to know the facts and simply \"lobbing a bomb\". Jessica Hromas\n\n\"But we have this really powerful, deep e-learning platform with thousands of learning modules, hundreds of exams ... and our customers' staff eat them up.\n\n\"Not everyone does those things, though. Some people buy the software and think it'll be better than their previous system but don't want to change anything they do. Then it becomes a very expensive electronic typewriter and not a very good use of the software.\"\n\nThe company has 15,000 certified CargoWise One professionals worldwide who have undertaken its training modules and exams.\n\nWhile Mr White said the company already gives the market \"an enormous amount of information\", he said it would continue to assess if more disclosure was needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe accused JCap of not wanting to know the facts and simply \"lobbing a bomb\".\n\n\"They weren't looking for more information to allay their fears ... they didn't want to understand us at all ... they didn't ask us any of the facts ... they just went hell for leather and lobbed a bomb in during trading on Thursday,\" he said.\n\n\"The problem is they're offshore ... And the world, particularly the internet, works globally and instantly.\"\n\nLike TechnologyOne executive chairman Adrian Di Marco, Mr White believed the assaults from firms like JCap could deter future tech leaders from listing.\n\n\"I'm worried about the next generation of tech leaders. They may well be repulsed by these types of attacks on listed companies,\" he said.\n\n\"It can\u2019t be a system used as a battering ram to win someone else a grand prize for distorting the facts.\"", "description": "Richard White says short seller researcher's reports could mislead and manipulate the market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8103%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_436%2C$y_27/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/84687ffe11f421892118b4205be771f23d04d328", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
