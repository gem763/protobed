In the piece, the editors praise new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his pro-reform agenda, and wondered why Trump was not warming up to him.\n\n\"Not only has Mr. Trump refused to grant the Ukrainian leader a White House visit, but also he has suspended the delivery of $250 million in U.S. military aid to a country still fighting Russian aggression in its eastern provinces,\" the editors write.\n\nThey then answer their own question.\n\nSome suspect Mr. Trump is once again catering to Mr. Putin, who is dedicated to undermining Ukrainian democracy and independence. But we\u2019re reliably told that the president has a second and more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump is not just soliciting Ukraine\u2019s help with his presidential campaign; he is using U.S. military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.\n\nGiuliani was reportedly one of the biggest instigators, pressuring Ukraine to investigate both Biden and his son Hunter for their connection to a Ukrainian gas company. He's tweeted publicly about the scandal in the past few months.\n\nExplain to me why Biden shouldn\u2019t be investigated if his son got millions from a Russian loving crooked Ukrainian oligarch while He was VP and point man for Ukraine. Ukrainians are investigating and your fellow Dems are interfering. Election is 17 months away.Let\u2019s answer it now https://t.co/FT34kX7Pst \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) May 10, 2019\n\nThe Politico coverup article doesn\u2019t mention the bribery of\n\nUkraine Pres. by then VP Biden to get the case against his son dismissed. Nor does it explain the Chinese pay-off of $1.5billion to Biden\u2019s useless fund. Joe took his son on AFII to get the investment. It stinks!! \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) August 3, 2019\n\nAfter seeing the WaPo op-ed, three Democratic House chairmen, Eliot L. Engel of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Adam B. Schiff of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Eli Cummings of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, announced on Monday that they're launching investigations into the controversy.\n\n\u201cA growing public record indicates that, for nearly two years, the President and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, appear to have acted outside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels to coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAs the 2020 election draws closer, President Trump and his personal attorney appear to have increased pressure on the Ukrainian government and its justice system in service of President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, and the White House and the State Department may be abetting this scheme.\u201d\n\nThe president has yet to respond to the Democrats' new probe, but we'll be refreshing Twitter!", "description": ".09/09/2019 19:17:37PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/266/1dd91349-16db-46a0-9816-21575184c25e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
