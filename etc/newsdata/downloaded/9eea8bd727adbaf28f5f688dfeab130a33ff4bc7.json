Martha McSally is one of the nation\u2018s most vulnerable incumbents. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo elections Democrats' path to the Senate runs straight through the Sun Belt\n\nTo take back the White House, Democrats only need to win back three key Rust Belt states. But if they want to move a president\u2019s agenda through the Senate, they have to flip the Sun Belt.\n\nFrom Arizona to North Carolina to a pair of seats in Georgia, Democrats have to clean up in that stretch of the country to have any chance of taking the chamber.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPresident Donald Trump carried each of those states in 2016, and in an era of polarized politics when Senate races are increasingly nationalized, Democrats need at least strong performances by the party's presidential nominee in the Sun Belt states \u2014 if not victories \u2014 to have a shot at flipping their Senate seats. So while some Democrats are laser-focused on winning back the Rust Belt, Democrats across the Southern half of the country are urging their party to invest heavily in their states \u2014 not just as a way to flip the Senate, but as part of the path to 270 Electoral College votes.\n\n\u201cThe path to the White House and the Senate majority must come through the Sun Belt and certainly must come through North Carolina,\u201d said Wayne Goodwin, that state's Democratic Party chairman. He referenced a House special election in the state last week that Republicans narrowly won in a district Trump carried by 12 points in 2016 as evidence of the party\u2019s prospects. \u201cFrankly, I think Republicans who are running statewide should be quaking in their boots for 2020.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not a simple equation for Democrats: Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has been pilloried for investing resources in Arizona and Georgia, while overlooking Wisconsin and, to a lesser extent, Michigan. But Democrats don\u2019t have Senate races in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania next year \u2014 in Michigan, they are defending Sen. Gary Peters \u2014 and investment in the emerging Sun Belt states will be critical down the ballot.\n\nThe question will remain unsettled until Democrats have a nominee \u2014 though many of the Senate states have relatively early primary contests, giving presidential contenders a chance to prove their mettle in potential battlegrounds.\n\n\u201cI think there's both a Rust Belt and Sun Belt strategy that are not incompatible at all,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist who has worked on presidential and Senate campaigns. He pointed to the party\u2019s gains among suburban women, in particular, as something that occurred across regions. \u201cThere are several places in both the Sun Belt and Rust Belt where they could make the difference.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Guy Cecil, the group\u2019s chairman, pointed to the overlap between expansion states and Senate races at a briefing for reporters Monday and said they would take a \u201cserious look\u201d at potentially investing in these states because of the Senate. He said North Carolina and Arizona should be on \u201ceveryone\u2019s target list,\u201d and that there would be \u201crobust conversations\u201d around Georgia.\n\n\"No agenda passes, nothing gets done, we have a much harder time dealing with judges if there's a Democratic president and a Republican Senate,\u201d Cecil said.\n\nDemocrats in those states are echoing the message. As the presidential contenders flocked to Houston for a debate last week, Texas Democrats homed in on arguments for why it could finally be a true battleground. Challenging for Georgia's 16 electoral votes would help the party contend for two Senate seats, including a special election for the seat Sen. Johnny Isakson will vacate when he resigns at the end of this year. And Arizona is seen as a potential opening after Trump carried it by less than 4 percentage points and Democrats won their first Senate race in three decades last year.\n\nIn Georgia, where Democrats haven't won a Senate race in two decades, Stacey Abrams not running dampened the party\u2019s chances to turn the race against Sen. David Perdue into a marquee matchup, and there is now a crowded primary of contenders. But the emergence of a second seat put the state squarely back into focus.\n\nIn a memo last week, Abrams detailed how 2020 candidates could build on her narrow defeat last year to put the state in play, both in the Senate races and at the presidential level. She called \u201cany less than full investment\u201d in the state \u201cstrategic malpractice.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorgia faces historic electoral opportunities, and Democrats cannot achieve success nationally without competing and winning in Georgia,\u201d she said.\n\nStacey Abrams not running dampened the party\u2019s chances to turn the race against Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema defeated Republican Martha McSally, who was later appointed to the state\u2019s other Senate seat and now faces a battleground race against Democrat Mark Kelly. Felecia Rotellini, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said they continue to build on the infrastructure and ground game from 2018.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in a very, very long time \u2014 in my lifetime \u2014 Arizona has been considered a battleground state,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to work harder, be more disciplined and be more organized in order to turn this state blue.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina, which Barack Obama carried in 2008 and lost four years later, may represent Democrats' best chance in the Sun Belt. The party's candidate lost a special election in a conservative district last week, but Democrats were buoyed by their overperformance compared with 2016.\n\n\u201cI think if you look in places like Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina, they're chock full of suburban women,\u201d said John Anzalone, a veteran Democratic pollster. He pointed out that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who is up for reelection next year, won North Carolina in 2016 even as Trump carried the state. \u201cYou have to have the right type of nominee to win the race, but it's not all about the top of the ticket.\u201d\n\nThom Tillis, the first-term North Carolina senator, also faces a wealthy GOP primary challenger. Tillis recently launched his first ad of the cycle highlighting his endorsement from Trump \u2014 and in a local radio interview this week, he emphasized the importance of his state up and down the ballot.\n\n\"North Carolina is going to be ground zero of the Senate, keeping the majority. It's going to be ground zero for the president winning his reelection,\" Tillis said, adding that the GOP's national party convention is in Charlotte.\n\nRepublicans scoffed at the Democratic optimism following the North Carolina special election, calling it a moral victory and downplaying concerns about the state.\n\n\u201cThe voters that are going to decide the outcome in 2020 were not voting in the special election,\u201d said Paul Shumaker, a top adviser Tillis. He called Democrats' optimism after the loss \u201cmore of a PR spin than a reality supported by data.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, Republicans aren\u2019t sweating their standing in these states, although they acknowledge that at least several of these Senate races are likely to be highly competitive. They argue Democrats' eventual presidential nominee is likely to provide plenty of fodder in a one-on-one matchup with Trump in states he carried.\n\n\u201cDemocrats fail to recognize the socialist agenda being promoted by the loudest voices in their party render their Senate candidates unelectable in these reliably Republican states,\u201d said Jesse Hunt, spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cMainstream voters are watching in horror as the Democratic Party embraces policies that eliminate employer-based health care and raise taxes on middle-class families.\u201d", "description": "The 2020 Senate map means a narrow, Rust Belt strategy in the presidential race would likely still leave Mitch McConnell as majority leader.", "authors": ["James Arkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c0/7e/dcbf6c314025ae4411999ff443c6/19919-martha-mcsally-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
