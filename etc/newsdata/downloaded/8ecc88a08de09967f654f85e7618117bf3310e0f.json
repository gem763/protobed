And over the summer, after ending her marriage to Liam Hemsworth, Cyrus embarked on a short-lived and highly publicized relationship with reality TV star Kaitlynn Carter.\n\nBut now that she\u2019s moved on with model and singer Cody Simpson, the Disney Channel alum apparently felt compelled to let women know that you \u201cdon\u2019t have to be gay\u201d because \u201cthere are good men out there.\u201d\n\nCyrus directed the message at her 100 million followers on Instagram on Sunday night during a livestream with Simpson, angering many of her fans.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up, you don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good dicks out there, you just have to find them\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI always thought I had to be gay because all guys are evil but that\u2019s not true\u201d\n\n\n\n- @MileyCyrus what's good? pic.twitter.com/y3yjUGpCSN \u2014 \u2022 (@bljcmie) October 21, 2019\n\n\u201cThere are good men out there, guys, don\u2019t give up. You don\u2019t have to be gay, there are good people with dicks out there, you\u2019ve just got to find them,\u201d Cyrus said, while Simpson laughed along. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a dick that\u2019s not a dick, you know? I always thought I had to be gay, because I thought all guys were evil, but it\u2019s not true. There are good people out there that just happen to have dicks. I\u2019ve only ever met one, and he\u2019s on this live.\u201d\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not how sexuality works, and Cyrus\u2019 comments perpetuate the damaging and false notion that queerness is a choice or a stop on a journey that eventually arrives at heterosexuality.\n\nHer comments immediately sparked backlash from disappointed queer fans, who dragged Cyrus not only for erasing bisexuality from the conversation, but for making light of an issue she\u2019s spoken so passionately about in the past.\n\nMiley, this is so not it. Women don\u2019t \u201chave to be gay\u201d because they \u201ccan\u2019t find a good person with a d*ck\u201d.\n\nDon\u2019t use the queer community as a stop-gap because you couldn\u2019t find a boyfriend.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t queer because they \u201cgave up\u201d on men.\n\nThis is so insulting. pic.twitter.com/lAzcEjHRcB \u2014 Rosie Percy (@rosiepercy) October 21, 2019\n\nshe was joking i'm pretty sure but yeah she shouldn't have said it regardless. \u2014 \u064b (@tellemcyrus) October 21, 2019\n\nMiley really had to go and say some dumb shit about being gay pic.twitter.com/wkP4LwdEi2 \u2014 \u064b\u064b (@iforgiveyiew) October 21, 2019\n\nDamn. In 30 seconds @MileyCyrus managed to burn up all goodwill she'd ever built with queer and trans people.\n\n\n\nNot all \"guys\" have dicks, Miley. Thought you knew better.\n\n\n\nYou \"had to be gay\" because men are bad? Do you not realize what an anti-lesbian trope that is?\n\n\n\nGross. \u2014 James Bradford's Undead Corpse (@jamesebradford) October 21, 2019\n\nOn Monday, Cyrus addressed her controversial comments, clarifying that she was \u201ctalking shit about sucky guys\u201d and reiterating her support for the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d she wrote on Instagram Stories, \u201cYOU don\u2019t CHOOSE your sexuality. You are born as you are. It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am a part of. Happy Monday!\u201d\n\nInstagram\n\nBefore her split with Hemsworth, Cyrus candidly discussed her \u201ccomplex\u201d marriage to the \u201cHunger Games\u201d star and her evolving sexuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a hetero relationship, but I still am very sexually attracted to women,\u201d Cyrus said at the time. \u201cPeople become vegetarian for health reasons, but bacon is still fucking good, and I know that. I made a partner decision. This is the person I feel has my back the most.\u201d\n\nBut if Cyrus\u2019 latest comments on Instagram are an indication, Hemsworth no longer falls into her \u201cgood men\u201d category.\n\nThe story has been updated with Cyrus\u2019 comments on Monday.", "description": "The singer sparked backlash for comments about her sexuality on Instagram Live with new boyfriend Cody Simpson.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dadc9fa210000431d34a951.png?cache=mr7anobdp6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
