Rather than allowing lies to triumph, listen to the angels of your better nature and rule that this prorogation is unlawful, an abuse of power which has been entrusted to the government.\n\n\u201cThis government has shown itself unworthy of our trust, as it uses the powers of its office in a manner that is corrosive of the constitution and destructive of the system of parliamentary, representative democracy upon which the union polity is founded. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nHe urged the judges: \u201cStand up for the truth, stand up for reason, stand up for unity and diversity, stand up for parliament, stand up for democracy by dismissing this government\u2019s appeal and upholding a constitution governed by laws and not the passing whims of men.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the government earlier in the day, Sir James Eadie QC defended Mr Johnson\u2019s decision not to provide a witness statement.\n\nHe said the government had made available an internal No 10 memo and a set of cabinet minutes that showed Mr Johnson had not been trying to \u201cstymie\u201d parliament when he asked the Queen to order the prorogation. Such claims were \u201cuntenable\u201d and \u201cunsustainable\u201d, he said.\n\nBut in a sign of frustration at the lack of a statement from Mr Johnson, Lord Wilson, one of the 11 judges hearing the case, said it was not enough to have documents \u201cfloating around\u201d without a signed affidavit.\n\nHe said: \u201cIsn\u2019t it odd that nobody has signed a witness statement to say, \u2018This is true, these are the true reasons for what was done\u2019?\u201d\n\nMuch of the highly complex case centres on whether the courts have the right to rule on the prime minister\u2019s use of his power to prorogue parliament.\n\nSir James told the court it was not for judges for intervene to rule against the prorogation when parliament itself had failed to do so. MPs \u201chad plenty of opportunities\u201d to pass a law overruling the suspension but opted not to, he said.\n\nThe power to prorogue parliament was, he said, \u201ca well-established constitutional function, exercisable and to be exercised by the executive\u201d.\n\nBut some of the judges appeared to express scepticism at that claim, with Lord Kerr pressing the QC on whether he was suggesting it would not be a matter for the courts even if a prime minister suspended parliament for as long as a year.\n\nSir James argued it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for judges to decide how long prorogation should last, and claimed it was \u201cnot appropriate for the court to be in that territory\u201d.\n\nSpeaking for the other side, Mr O\u2019Neill said Mr Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament \u201chad the intent and effect of preventing parliament, impeding parliament, from holding the government politically to account at a time when the government is taking decisions which will have constitutional and irreversible impacts on our country\u201d.\n\nWith parliament suspended, the courts were the \u201conly constitutional actor left standing\u201d to hold the government to account, he said.\n\nThe barrister also revealed he had attempted to hand a legal petition directly to the Queen, driving 400 miles from his holiday in Devon to the monarch\u2019s Balmoral residence in Scotland.\n\nThe court was told it was not clear how the government would respond if the Supreme Court ruled Mr Johnson\u2019s advice recommending prorogation was unlawful.\n\nGovernment lawyers again suggested the prime minister could attempt to prorogue parliament for a second time, but Sir James said he could not give more information because ministers\u2019 response would depend on what the court says.\n\nThat did not satisfy the judges, and Lady Hale, the president of the court, asked the government to provide written confirmation of how it planned to proceed in this scenario.\n\nThe hearing will continue on Thursday when the court will hear a submission from former prime minister Sir John Major.", "description": "Boris Johnson was dubbed \u201cthe father of lies\u201d and his government accused of playing \u201cdishonest, dirty tricks\u201d on the second day of a Supreme Court hearing into the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament.
