Coleman, like his team-mates, had endured a wretched night.\n\n\u2018Switzerland proved they're a very good side \u2013 it's no shock to me,\u2019 said McCarthy.\n\n\u2018We still have a chance to qualify automatically, and I would have taken that. It\u2019s a cup final in the Aviva now.\u2019\n\nMcCarthy started with Brighton teenager Aaron Connolly in attack knowing that a win would see them qualify. But Ireland had more changes in formation than chances during a first half in which they struggled to string two passes together.\n\nThey were much improved after the break - it was hard not to be - but there is a sad inevitability about this team being incapable of reversing a scoreline once they fall behind.\n\nEdimilson Fernandes celebrates after scoring his side's second with the last touch of the game\n\nManager Mick McCarthy looks on as his team missed the chance to qualify for Euro 2020\n\nIndeed, it was six years to the day since Ireland last came from behind to win a competitive game. They just don\u2019t do goals and even efforts on goal are seldom seen these days.\n\nDuffy did head on target from a Glenn Whelan corner but Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer was otherwise a spectator.\n\nThe result means the Swiss will be through if they beat Georgia and Gibraltar next month, while Ireland must overcome Denmark. If not, it will be a four-team playoff and the risk of missing out on a tournament for which they are one of the hosts.\n\nTo avoid that ignominy, however, they are going to have to score a goal at some point - and on current form that looks about as likely as McCarthy scaling the nearby Mont Blanc.\n\nSeamus Coleman reacts after the referee points to the penalty spot for his handball\n\nColeman is shown a red card by referee Szymon Marciniak after receiving his second booking", "description": "CRAIG HOPE AT STADE DE GENEVE: Republic of Ireland will have to beat Denmark in Dublin next month if they are to avoid the Euro 2020 playoffs after another uninspiring night here in Switzerland.", "authors": ["Craig Hope For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760042-0-image-a-12_1571176693156.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
