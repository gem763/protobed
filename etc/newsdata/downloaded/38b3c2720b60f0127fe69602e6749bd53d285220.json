The number of millionaires would also grow over this period to almost 63 million.\n\nThe share of the world's bottom 90% accounts for 18% of global wealth, compared to 11% in the 2000.\n\n\"While it is too early to say wealth inequality is now in a downward phase, the prevailing evidence suggests that 2016 may have been the peak for the near future,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Ros Russell)", "description": "The number of rich Chinese has surpassed the count of wealthy Americans for the first time as both countries keep churning out millionaires, a study by Credit Suisse showed.
