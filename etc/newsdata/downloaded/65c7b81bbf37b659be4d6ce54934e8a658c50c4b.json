And at some point that list will exceed the capacity of your brain and spill over on to the closest paper to hand. To lose yourself to Autonauts is to find notes like \u201creprogram plank-sorting robots!\u201d scrawled on the backs of envelopes scattered around your computer.\n\nAutonauts is a game about colonising new worlds; landing alone on an unspoiled planet, your task is to build a thriving civilisation. There\u2019s a little of the DNA of genre classics such as SimCity in there, but Autonauts busies you relentlessly with the fine detail of constructing a new settlement. Every individual plank must be hand-cut from logs, every tool assembled from scavenged materials, and every new structure must have its component elements delivered on foot before building work can begin. And there\u2019s only one of you.\n\nEasing the task of turning a patch of land into a bustling colony is automation. The most important thing you build in Autonauts is helper robots, each of which can be assigned to different tasks \u2013 a process that involves programming them using a real, functioning coding language.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to be proficient in Basic or C to get going \u2013 the game teaches you everything as you go, and it is the coding and automation that makes Autonauts something special. If you find yourself repeating a job too often \u2013 perhaps chopping down trees \u2013 then a robot can be programmed to do it for you. Using a basic \u201cvisual programming\u201d language, you can create \u201cscripts\u201d to guide a robot\u2019s behaviour, all without typing a line of code. Instead, you teach the robots by asking them to observe how you approach a task. That generates a script made of different coloured blocks, each representing a command like \u201cpick up\u201d, \u201cmove to\u201d or \u201cuse\u201d.\n\nThat script can then be edited to tweak a robot\u2019s function. Adding a \u201crepeat\u201d block, for example, loops a given task over and over. Hit a play button, and the robot sets off to work. Fundamentally, it works somewhat like real game development tools.\n\nYou could reasonably describe Autonauts as a busywork simulator combined with a coding tool, but that misrepresents just how fun \u2013 and rewarding \u2013 it is to play. It absolutely delivers the satisfying sense of establishing your unique outpost, and seeing a functioning rural hub emerge from the earth is entirely captivating.\n\nThis pleasure ramps up when you start to feel a sense of what it is to be creative with coding. Building robots in Autonauts isn\u2019t quick, and it needs to be done often. The instance in which you think to program a robot to build robots for you is a striking moment. Everything you can do in-game can be automated, and near-tangible shift in your thinking comes as you conceive ever more clever ways to automate complex tasks.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Down on the robot farm \u2026 Autonauts. Photograph: Curve Digital\n\nAnd that is Autonauts\u2019 greatest achievement. It opens something in you that makes you think like a creative coder, using automation to solve puzzles of efficiency. There are times you may feel a little lost when a dollop of guidance would be perfect. The playfield can get so busy with activity it can be hard to see why a robot isn\u2019t performing as instructed. The soundscape could be more diverse. A scattering of additional narrative beats might bring a shade more context and energy to the toil.\n\nBut, while wildly ornate, Autonauts is in equal parts playful, welcoming and charming. It is comparable to the cute farming sim Stardew Valley, yet it is very much its own game. And in the taste it gives you of thinking like a creative coder, it is in its own quiet way empowering and exciting.", "description": "There\u2019s plenty to do in this exciting and empowering simulation game, where automation is the key to your shining future", "authors": ["Will Freeman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9715c677ba65e1001287bcc4be2df5d1509630/0_624_2228_1337/master/2228.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4b53cd4f8b1d0ac022ad56f821297676", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
