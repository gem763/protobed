In 2016, the beauty mogul attempted to trademark the name \"Kylie\" \u2013 a move singer Kylie Minogue opposed.\n\nAccording to documents, KDB Pty Ltd. filed a Notice of Opposition on behalf of Minogue in February of that year, claiming that granting Jenner the desired trademark would dilute Minogue's brand. It also mentions that the singer is \"known worldwide simply as 'Kylie,'\" and that Minogue registered the domain www.kylie.com in 1996.\n\nMore:Kylie Jenner singing 'Rise and Shine' in an epic mom voice has taken the internet by storm\n\nAlong with establishing Minogue's longtime presence, the notice was quick to shade Jenner, calling her a \"secondary reality television personality who appeared on the television series 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' as a supporting character, to Ms. Jenner\u2019s halfsisters.\"\n\nMore:Kylie Jenner?
