He has Indigenous art tattooed his shoulder. He wears Ramadan socks and dances to bhangra music.\n\nTrudeau scrambles to halt damage as third blackface incident emerges Read more\n\nBut the emergence of three damning images of the Canadian prime minister in blackface have shattered the prime minister\u2019s carefully curated image as a progressive leader.\n\nThe incident has landed the prime minister in hot water as his Liberal party fights to secure another four-year term in a tightly contested federal election.\n\nTrudeau quickly apologized \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself. I\u2019m disappointed in myself,\u201d he told reporters \u2013 but the damage may already have been done, said Amarnath Amarasingam, a professor of religion at Queens University.\n\n\u201cI have a difficult time seeing him wiggle his way out of this one. He\u2019s not an authentic kind of messenger on the race issue. He\u2019s not an authentic messenger on the discrimination issue because he\u2019s never led that conversation in the country before,\u201d he said.\n\nThe timing for Trudeau is particularly bad: only weeks ago, the prime minister publicly castigated the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, over a recently unearthed video clip from 2005, in which Scheer expressed skepticism over the idea of gay marriage.\n\nScheer has seized on the blackface images, saying Trudeau \u201chas lost the moral authority to govern\u201d.\n\nBut the Conservative leader also has to grapple with that fact members of his own party have a history of racist or homophobic statements and social media posts. Scheer told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions \u2013 a standard he appeared unprepared to offer to Trudeau.\n\n\u201cThe more we get caught up in dichotomization of \u2018You said something racist and therefore you\u2019re bad\u2019, the more we\u2019re likely to miss the real point,\u201d said Aditya Rao, an Ottawa-based human rights lawyer. \u201cI worry that people are looking to score political points off of this.\u201d\n\nWhile Trudeau will likely sustain political damage in the coming days, he\u2019s unlikely to be facing an existential crisis, said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.\n\nThe immediate winners may be the leftwing New Democratic party. The NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, gave a powerful speech on Wednesday, in which he described the chilling impact the images had on him \u2013 and on millions of other Canadians who faced racism growing up.\n\n\u201cThe kids that see this image, the people that see this image, are going to think about all the times in their life that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, that they were hit, that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less because of who they are,\u201d Singh said.\n\nBut that boost for the NDP may fade away as the election draws closer: progressive voters turned off by Trudeau\u2019s escapades are unlikely to transfer their support to Scheer\u2019s party. \u201cA lot of those people will just fall back to the Liberals, because their primary objective will be to vote against the Conservatives \u2026 It\u2019s going to be a rough few days for the Liberals, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna move the needle in the polls much as the Conservatives might hope,\u201d said Wiseman.\n\nBeyond the immediate political frenzy, the emergence of Trudeau\u2019s blackface images has also cast a spotlight on a deeper thread of systematic racism in Canada.\n\nCanada\u2019s Indigenous population is disproportionately represented among murder victims, prison inmates and the child welfare system. First Nation communities struggle with enduring poverty and exclusion. Black residents of Toronto are 20 times more likely to be shot dead by the police than their white neighbours.\n\n\u201cCanadians generally see racism through the lens of what we are not. We are not the United States. We are not Europe. We\u2019re not having tiki-torch marches,\u201d said Amarasingam. \u201cWe always feel like we\u2019re kind of \u2018above the rest\u2019 when it comes to issues of race and racism and discrimination.\u201d\n\nBalpreet Singh of the World Sikh Organization, describe Trudeau\u2019s use of blackface as \u201cmocking\u201d and \u201churtful\u201d \u2013 but then pointed to Quebec\u2019s provincial government which recently introduced legislation banning public sector employees from wearing religious symbols \u2013 a law that disproportionately targets visible minorities.\n\n\u201cA picture of the prime minister in blackface is bad. But the fact that there\u2019s a province in Canada that is telling the members of certain religious groups that they\u2019re second-class citizens and won\u2019t be employed \u2013 that\u2019s really a thousand times worse,\u201d he said.", "description": "Incident has landed the prime minister in hot water as his Liberal party fights to secure another term in a tightly contested election", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a336081d45c13a00204270e5332fabb94947524c/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b59e1f32ca675ef7776ac1f0ae86daf", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
