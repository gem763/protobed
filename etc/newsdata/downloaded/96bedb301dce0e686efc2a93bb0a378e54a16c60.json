(Photo: NBC via Getty Images)\n\nDave Chappelle\u2019s homophobic and racist joke about Asians in his Netflix special \u201cSticks & Stones\u201d did not go unnoticed.\n\nIn an interview with WNYC\u2019s \u201cAll Of It,\u201d Korean American comedian Joel Kim Booster addressed the joke, in which Chappelle performs a backward, archaic and blatantly racist impression of a Chinese person while taking a jab at trans people.\n\nChappelle joked that if trans people were born in the wrong body, he could apply the same logic to race. What\u2019s more, Chappelle attempted to mitigate his errors by noting that his wife is Asian.\n\nBooster said he\u2019d originally avoided the subject but ultimately found the whole situation \u201ckind of sad.\u201d\n\nChappelle is \u201csomeone who has been rich for a long time now and no longer has that many interesting things to say, because they\u2019re not really living in the same world you or I are living in, at this point,\u201d he said in the interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad; I think Chappelle used to have really interesting and prescient things to say about power structures and things like that, and I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested in dismantling that anymore,\u201d Booster explained. \u201cAt least not from an interesting place, or at least not from beyond his own point of view \u2014 which is his right as a comic, I guess, but it felt a little bit, I don\u2019t know, old, when I watched it.\u201d\n\nMany critics are panning Chappelle\u2019s special as tired at best and offensive at worst. Once regarded as a comedian with edgy commentary on pop culture, Chappelle came under fire for taking aim at the subjects of \u201cLeaving Neverland,\u201d two men who accused Michael Jackson of molesting them, as well as members of the LGBTQ community. He also performs a bit backing Louis C.K. despite his sexual misconduct toward women.\n\nSlate\u2019s Inkoo Kang compared watching Chappelle\u2019s special to \u201cdropping in on a rascally uncle who doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t care, how much he\u2019s disappointing you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, his jokes make you wince. The soundness of their logic is as intact as ever, but they\u2019re seldom informed by facts or new perspectives,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAnd Vanity Fair called the show \u201cstale work from a comedian who was once known for truly boundary-pushing comedy\u2014the kind that actually understood nuance, particularly where famous and powerful men were concerned.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
