Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory -- that his Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer,\u201d Oppenheim wrote to staffers.\n\nOppenheim and NBC News chairman Andy Lack have been accused of a \u201cmassive breach of journalistic integrity\u201d by Farrow\u2019s former NBC News producer Rich McHugh. Farrow has long claimed that NBC News stopped his reporting in an attempt to essentially cover for Weinstein. The situation has been a public relations nightmare for NBC and Oppenheim\u2019s memo to staffers is the latest attempt to discredit \u201cCatch and Kill\u201d before its Tuesday release. The highly anticipated book details Farrow\u2019s side of the story and the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter has already caused NBC executives to release statements and hold staffer sit-downs prior to its official release on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cFarrow alleges there were employees who reported Lauer\u2019s behavior prior to November of 2017 and were paid settlements to silence them. Not only is this false, the so-called evidence Farrow uses in his book to support the charge collapses under the slightest scrutiny,\u201d Oppenheim wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Farrow did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the author responded on \"CBS This Morning\" Monday when informed of Oppenheim\u2019s email.\n\n\u201cThis book is an extraordinary, meticulously fact-checked work of investigative journalism. It's two years of reporting, one of the senior fact-checkers at The New Yorker checked it, I\u2019ll let the reporting in the book stand on its own. We\u2019re very confident in it,\u201d Farrow said.\n\nNBC NEWS PRESIDENT MOCKED BY STAFFERS DURING FIERY MEETING ABOUT LAUER RAPE CLAIM\n\nNBC News famously refused to hire an outside investigator to dig into who knew about Lauer\u2019s behavior, instead allowing internal general counsel Kim Harris to conduct a review. The internal review eventually declared that NBC management was completely oblivious to alleged sexual misconduct that was happening under their noses. While the internal review was widely criticized, Oppenheim is again relying on Harris \u2013 this time to discredit Farrow\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cKim Harris and the NBCU Legal Team have reviewed both the book and the referenced agreements and I\u2019d like to share their analysis. The only three examples we can find that Farrow alleges are Lauer-related before 2017, with even minimal detail, involve employees who by their own admission made no complaint to management, and whose departure agreements were unrelated to Lauer and completely routine,\u201d Oppenheim told NBC staffers before detailing the three examples.\n\nAccording to Oppenheim\u2019s memo, Farrow said a woman named in the book disclosed her allegation to former NBC News anchor Ann Curry in 2010.\n\n\u201cCurry says she then told two executives \u2013 both of whom are no longer with the company \u2013 that Lauer \u2018had a problem with women.\u2019 By her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer\u2019s \u2018problem\u2019 regarded any specific workplace misconduct,\u201d Oppenheim wrote. \u201cNBCU was able to speak with one of those former executives during the 2018 review and she denied having been told even this.\u201d\n\nLAUER\u2019S OFFICE SEXCAPADES KNOWN TO MEDIA ELITES, WHO ROARED WITH LAUGHTER OVER LEWD JOKES AT 2008 \u2018ROAST\u2019\n\nLast week, Farrow appeared on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and said that \u201cthere were multiple secret settlements and non-disclosures being struck with women at NBC News,\u201d but Oppenheim\u2019s memo combats this claim.\n\nThe NBC News president added, \u201cat the time of the employee\u2019s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer,\u201d and that her severance was based on years of service, not designed to prevent misconduct claims.\n\nOppenheim then wrote that the \u201con-air personality\u201d who Farrow reported received inappropriate messages from Lauer never complained to management and signed a standard confidentiality provision \u201cdesigned to protect proprietary company information, not prevent an employee from reporting misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe third point that Oppenheim disputes is that, according to the book, a \u201csenior member of the Today show team\u201d departed in 2017 with a seven-figure payout.\n\nMATT LAUER BREAKS SILENCE ON RAPE ACCUSATION: READ HIS LETTER HERE\n\n\u201cOur records indicate only one exit that matches this description and we can state unequivocally that no claims related to Lauer or sexual harassment of any kind were raised in that process. Farrow says this person \u2018mentioned Lauer and sexual harassment\u2019 to a \u2018senior vice president\u2019 but offers no details on who, when, or what exactly she said,\u201d Oppenheim wrote. \u201cShe signed a completely standard separation agreement, including a routine confidentiality provision that was in her original employment contract. Once again, in no way was it designed to prevent her from reporting misconduct. Her severance was commensurate with her salary.\u201d\n\nOppenheim, who many industry insiders feel will take the fall for the situation if NBC\u2019s parent company decides to take action amid an onslaught of embarrassing headlines, wrote that Farrow\u2019s book \u201cis built on a series of distortions, confused timelines and outright inaccuracies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel absolutely terrible that these three employees were subjected to Matt Lauer\u2019s horrific behavior, but the facts do not support Farrow\u2019s allegation of a \u2018cover-up,\u2019 and he offers no further evidence,\u201d Oppenheim wrote. \u201cThere is no evidence of any reports of Lauer's misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no \u2018hush money\u2019 \u2013 no way we have found that NBC's current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past.\u201d\n\nOppenheim then appeared to blame past NBC leadership for much of the ongoing public relations debacle.\n\nCNN BOSS JEFF ZUCKER ESCAPES QUESTIONS ABOUT OLD COLLEAGUE MATT LAUER\n\n\u201cWe can all agree those misdeeds should have come to light sooner, and that we should have had a culture in which anyone who knew about his abuse would have felt comfortable telling management. And if anyone on any past management team knew, they should have taken action. But we cannot undo mistakes that may have been made by people who have long since left the company,\u201d Oppenheim wrote.\n\nCurrent CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker was the executive producer of \u201cToday\u201d when Lauer was hired in 1994 and had oversight of the morning show anchor while in various roles until leaving NBC in 2010. Zucker has denied knowledge of Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe can make sure the culture today ensures this can never happen again,\u201d Oppenheim wrote. \u201cAnd that is what we have tried to do, each and every day since the moment Matt's offenses first came to light.\u201d\n\nOppenheim added that, \u201cFarrow takes the first false allegation \u2013 that we knew about Lauer's offenses \u2013 and uses it to sustain another, that we obstructed his reporting on Harvey Weinstein,\u201d and then listed a series of fact-checks related to \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d\n\nOppenheim also included an NBC News \u201cfact sheet\u201d that details the network\u2019s side of the story.", "description": "Embattled NBC News president Noah Oppenheim called Ronan Farrow's book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d an \u201ceffort to defame\u201d the Peacock Network that is \u201cclearly motivated not by a pursuit of truth, but an axe to grind\u201d in a memo sent to employees Monday morning.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
