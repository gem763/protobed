While stunts like offering laundry at a store near New York University or radically changing its physical store design haven't always translated directly to sales, it helps the company understand what works.\n\n\"You have to try some stuff and fail because it gives you so much information to then try something else,\" she said. \"American Eagle is very good at that. We're investing and researching, we're trying different things both online and offline, and we're trying to get more nimble and move faster.\"\n\nAn American Eagle concept store in NYC. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nAmerican Eagle has established itself as one of the few mall brands that have managed to stay afloat and avoid mass closures in recent years. In September, the company reported its 18th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales, with an increase of 2% in the second quarter of 2019. Aerie in particular continues to shine, posting 16% quarterly growth and ongoing national store openings.\n\nRecent initiatives like the American Eagle Youth Council \u2014 a group of teenagers who regularly consult with the corporate team on clothing styles and company efforts \u2014 have also helped build brand cachet, Andrew said. So too have outspoken efforts against topical issues like gun violence and testing models like buy-now, pay-later.\n\nRead more: American Eagle says it plans to offer buy-now, pay-later services as it appeals to cash-strapped teens\n\n\"Back in the heyday, it was all about Abercrombie and American Eagle telling people what they should look like, what's cool, and what you need to dress like,\" she said. \"Now we're really taking very different tactics ... our advantage is we've gotten so good at understanding our customer. We built a really strong database. We mine for information day in and day out.\"\n\nWhen it comes to innovation, however, she cautioned against rushing to integrate technology into physical stores merely for the sake of trying to appear modern.\n\n\"The digital piece has to enable the experiences you're trying to create versus digital being the 'thing,'\" she said. \"A lot of [retailers] fall into that trap of, 'Let's just put some technology and screens up.' It doesn't work that way.\"\n\nKambiz Hemati \u2014 vice president of global store design at Foot Locker, who also spoke at the UBS event \u2014echoed Andrew's sentiments.\n\n\"Every time we tried to incorporate digital in stores that turned into just a giant iPad on the wall it was a failure,\" he said.", "description": "Kyle Andrew, chief marketing officer at American Eagle, attributed much of the company's success to its willingness to experiment.", "authors": ["Bethany Biron"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c102df5a5ac611efb602801-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
