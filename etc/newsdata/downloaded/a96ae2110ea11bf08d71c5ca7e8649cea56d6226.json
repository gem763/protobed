(Alice Martins/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe U.S. military is taking custody of several dozen high-value Islamic State detainees, including two British men accused of involvement in the militant group\u2019s summary executions of American and other Western hostages. The action is designed to prevent their escape or release from camps in Syria, where they have been guarded by Kurdish forces now under threat from Turkey\u2019s incursion, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe move, a rare instance in which the United States has taken direct responsibility for Islamic State prisoners in Iraq and Syria, comes as U.S. officials scramble to ensure that Ankara\u2019s unfolding military operation does not permit the Islamic State to regain strength.\n\nThe roughly 40 individuals being taken into U.S. custody, all considered important Islamic State figures, previously had been held in a constellation of small prisons in northeast Syria, run by Syrian Kurdish forces who have been the Pentagon\u2019s primary partner against the Islamic State in Syria. The Kurds are now pulling guards from those facilities to confront the unfolding Turkish assault.\n\nThe British pair \u2014 part of a group of four British militants dubbed the \u201cBeatles\u201d by their hostages \u2014 were being detained with the goal of putting them on trial in the United States, said a senior U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. That official said the two men \u2014 Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh \u2014 had been taken to Iraq; other officials said recent administration discussions about the fate of those prisoners had examined the possibility of bringing them to Iraq. It was not clear whether that had occurred or whether they had been taken somewhere else.\n\n\u201cWe are taking some of the most dangerous ISIS fighters out,\u201d President Trump said at the White House on Wednesday, using an acronym for the Islamic State. \u201cWe are taking them out and putting them in different locations, where it\u2019s secure. . . . We have a certain number of ISIS fighters that are particularly bad, and we wanted to make sure that nothing happened with them in respect to getting out.\u201d\n\nA criminal prosecution in the United States rests on the ability to obtain evidence from British authorities \u2014 a matter being litigated in the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. In recent days, Attorney General William P. Barr asked Trump to make securing the detention of the two men a \u201cpriority\u201d so they could be eventually prosecuted in the United States, and the president \u201cimmediately agreed,\u201d according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\n\n\nAlexanda Kotey, seen in a detention center in Rmeilan, Syria, on Aug. 4, 2019. (Alice Martins/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe British men are accused of involvement in the beheading of Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig as well as other Western hostages.\n\nThe Turkish attack on Kurdish forces raised concerns about the ability of the Kurds to maintain control over thousands of Islamic State detainees, as well as tens of thousands of women and children housed in separate camps, some of which are militant supporters.\n\n\u201cThis is like a victory for the ISIS fighters. I just think it\u2019s appalling,\u201d said Diane Foley, James Foley\u2019s mother. \u201cIt\u2019s an abdication of our responsibility to ensure safety for our own citizens and allies.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said that the U.S. military had orders not to intervene if the Kurds abandoned detention facilities to press all of their troops into the fight with Turkey. That position appears to be changing now as the military takes custody of a small portion of those detainees, suggesting the Pentagon is revising its plans amid a fast-moving situation.\n\n\u201cWe now face the very real prospect of 10,000 ISIS prisoners rejoining the battlefield,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D.-N.H.) said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n[Pentagon won\u2019t take over Islamic State prisons if U.S.-allied Kurdish forces withdraw, officials say]\n\nMohammed Emwazi, the man who killed Foley, Sotloff, Kassig and other hostages in 2014, was killed in a drone strike the following year. A fourth American, Kayla Mueller, was killed while being held hostage by the Islamic State, but the exact cause of her death was not confirmed.\n\nKotey and Elsheikh had been in custody of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Their potential transfer to the United States for trial has been delayed by Elsheikh\u2019s mother, Maha Elgizouli, who has challenged the British government\u2019s decision not to prosecute her son in Britain. She also has sued the British government to block any evidence-sharing with U.S. prosecutors without legal assurance that her son will not be executed.\n\n\u201cMrs. Elgizouli is solely concerned to protect her son from the death penalty,\u201d attorney Edward Fitzgerald said in a July hearing before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. \u201cShe recognizes that they should face justice. . . . But she submits that they should face justice in this country.\u201d\n\nBut British authorities for years have said they would prefer to see the two charged in the United States.\n\nProsecutors in the United States would seek to convict Kotey and Elsheikh as conspirators in hostage-taking resulting in death, a charge that carries a potential death sentence, according to U.S. officials.\n\nIn an interview this summer, Kotey and Elsheikh denied involvement in any murders, saying they only facilitated ransom negotiations. Both men agreed to speak to The Washington Post, and Kurdish security officials facilitated separate interviews at a facility in Rmeilan, Syria.\n\nTheir role, both said, was to ask prisoners for contact information and personal details for \u201cproof of life.\u201d Kotey recalled having prisoners hold up signs urging their governments and families to \u201cbe quick or they will be kill me.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Kotey said, a Syrian prisoner was shot in the back of the head in front of the European prisoners, who were made to hold signs saying they wanted to avoid a similar fate.\n\nThe British and American hostages were not included in that video, he said, because their governments were not negotiating.\n\n\u201cThey were not pampered,\u201d Elsheikh said. \u201cThe treatment had to be harsh to keep them in the state of mind\u201d of compliance. \u201cThe prisoners had to be kept always under pressure.\u201d\n\nHe said the harsh treatment included headlocks, punches and stress positions. But he denied any involvement in mock executions or waterboarding.\n\nKotey said he saw Emwazi, better known as \u201cJihadi John,\u201d beat prisoners and threaten to waterboard them \u201cas if he had previously\u201d done so. He said Emwazi saw the killing of journalists and aid workers as warranted because they had \u201ccome to interfere in our internal affairs.\u201d\n\nBoth Kotey and Elsheikh claim they were no longer working with Emwazi when the killing of hostages began. But they say they were among a very small group of Islamic State members who knew Emwazi\u2019s true identity, first reported in The Washington Post in early 2015.\n\nA decision is expected in the coming weeks from the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on whether the British government\u2019s offer to share evidence on Elsheikh and Kotey, absent a promise from the United States that the men will not face the death penalty, violates British law.\n\nToby Cadman, a British lawyer representing Diane Foley, said he also worries that moving the prisoners around could create new opportunities for the defendants\u2019 families to delay a prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe last thing anyone wants is for the process to be . . . fudged in order to get them before a court that they can then challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want these people lawfully handed over.\u201d\n\nA fourth \u201cBeatle,\u201d Aine Davis, was convicted in Turkey of membership in a terrorist organization and sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nMekhennet reported from Rmeilan, Syria.
