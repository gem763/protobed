The agreement is designed to facilitate investigations related to terrorism, child abuse and exploitation, and other serious crimes.\n\nRelated: Zuckerberg: I'll 'go to the mat and fight' Warren over plan to break up Facebook\n\nPrior to the agreement, requests for data from foreign technology companies were submitted to governments and frequently took between six months to two years. The new bilateral agreement is expected to speed this process significantly, to weeks or even days.\n\nThe draft open letter was first reported by BuzzFeed News. The governments\u2019 request will reignite a longstanding debate over how to balance privacy with public safety.\n\nZuckerberg defended his decision to encrypt the company\u2019s messaging services despite concerns about its impact on child exploitation and other criminal activity.\n\nZuckerberg, speaking Thursday in a livestreamed version of the company\u2019s weekly internal Q&A session, said child exploitation risks weighed \u201cmost heavily\u201d on him when he was making the decision and pledged steps to minimize harm.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cWe strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.\u201d\n\nWhat are Facebook\u2019s planned changes?\n\nFacebook\u2019s messaging app WhatsApp already employs end-to-end encryption, shielding the content of its 1.5bn users\u2019 messages from the company itself. In March 2019, Zuckerberg announced plans to integrate Facebook\u2019s other messaging apps, Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with WhatsApp and incorporate end-to-end encryption across the entire service. Facebook\u2019s move to expand the use of encryption followed a year in which the company came under global criticism for its failure to protect the data of its users, and it was branded as a pivot toward a \u201cprivacy-focused communications platform\u201d.\n\nFacebook has announced end-to-end encryption for all its messaging apps.

Not doing so hinders our law enforcement agencies\u2019 ability to stop criminals and abusers in their tracks.\u201d\n\nThe letter specifically focuses on the threat of child sexual exploitation and abuse, noting that Facebook\u2019s combination of encrypted messaging and open profiles could provide \u201cunique routes for prospective offenders to identify and groom our children\u201d.", "description": "Facebook says it opposes calls for backdoors that would \u2018undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere\u2019Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill in Washington last month.
