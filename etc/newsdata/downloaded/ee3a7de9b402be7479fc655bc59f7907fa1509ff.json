It's not what we expect.\"\n\nThe Fed approved the quarter-point reduction even though its economic assessment changed little. The statement announcing the move featured language almost identical to that following the July rate cut, justifying the easing as a response to a weakening global economy and low inflation.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee members generally see the economy as running strong, Powell said.\n\n\"We made one decision today, and that decision was to lower the funds rate by a quarter percentage point. We believe that action is appropriate to promote our objectives,\" he said. \"We're going to be highly data dependent. I would also say as we often do that we're not on a preset course.\"\n\nThe cut came without indications that further reductions are ahead.\n\nIn fact, committee members were divided over the future course, with no additional reductions this year narrowly carrying the day. Powell acknowledged that making policy in the current environment is difficult and emphasized that officials are flexible in their approach.\n\n\"Sometimes the path ahead is clear and sometimes less so,\" he said. \"We're going to be looking carefully meeting by meeting a full range of information and we're going to assess the appropriate stance of policy as we go.\"", "description": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell pledged that the central bank would engage in a \"sequence\" of interest rate cuts if conditions warrant, but he doesn't see that as necessary now.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106011653-1562769142679gettyimages-1154875451.jpeg?v=1568730616", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
