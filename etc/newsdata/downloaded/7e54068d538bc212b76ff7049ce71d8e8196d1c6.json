You can be LeBron James, Barack Obama or Beyonc\u00e9 without darkening your complexion in a way that is sure to offend and teach your kids that it is ok when it\u2019s definitely not ok.\n\nIf you need a primer on why blackface will always be racist, History.com has an excellent piece about the way blackface minstrel shows soared in popularity following the Civil War and into the 19th century, during a time of intense racial hostility:\n\nThomas Dartmouth Rice , an actor born in New York, is considered the \u201cFather of Minstrelsy.\u201d After reportedly travelling to the South and observing slaves, Rice developed a black stage character called \u201cJim Crow\u201d in 1830. With quick dance moves, an exaggerated African-American vernacular and buffoonish behaviour, Rice founded a new genre of racialised song and dance\u2014blackface minstrel shows\u2014which became central to American entertainment in the North and South.\n\n\u201cThe process of darkening one\u2019s face was about objectifying and dehumanising a community in ways that then allowed society to find a moral peace with the violence that was taking place,\u201d says David Leonard, a professor of comparative ethnic studies and American studies at Washington State University. \u201cBlackface needs to not only be put into the history books but is something that (white Americans) still have yet to account for.\u201d\n\nParents should start by educating themselves on the history of blackface in America. Part of the privilege of whiteness, Leonard says, is to be immune from the history of blackface and have the choice to ignore the pain it causes. But it\u2019s up to us to help our kids understand the history of the practice so they grow up to know better and do better.\n\nWhy? Because more than half of white adults still think it\u2019s \u201calways,\u201d \u201csometimes\u201d or at least occasionally acceptable to use blackface (incorrect). The same percentage of black adults say it\u2019s never acceptable (correct).\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll often hear, \u2018it\u2019s just about fun, it\u2019s just about the holiday,\u2019\u201d Leonard says. \u201cWhat message does that send that my fun or that my child\u2019s fun comes at the expense of others?\u201d\n\nDoes intent matter?\n\nAs Leonard points out, white people who wear blackface often claim ignorance of its racist roots after the fact. That\u2019s a pretty shaky argument, even with children; even if the child didn\u2019t know better, the parent certainly should. But whether or not the intent is to harm, harm will still be done.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m walking on the street and I step on someone\u2019s toe, yes, my intent might matter, if I did it on accident or on purpose,\u201d Leonard says. \u201cBut it hurts no matter what; if it was an accident, that doesn\u2019t make the pain or the bruise any less felt. So this focus on intent ... belies the pain, it belies the history.\u201d\n\nParents can work with their kids to create costumes that honour their favourite black idols in a respectful way. A child dressing as LeBron James might wear a basketball jersey under a business suit because James is well-known as a basketball player, businessman and community activist.\n\n\u201cBut simply putting on a jersey and blackening one\u2019s face is not (respectful),\u201d Leonard says. \u201cIt\u2019s belittling, it\u2019s mocking, and it\u2019s reducing him to something that is ridiculed.\u201d", "description": "With Halloween just one day away and all the last-minute costume-making panic that is sure to ensue, it seems like a good time for a friendly reminder: Blackface is still racist and should not be a part of anyone\u2019s costume, child or adult.
