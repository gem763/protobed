Rape and incest are not grounds for a legal abortion, nor is foetal abnormality.\n\nPhoto credit: PAUL FAITH - Getty Images More\n\nWhat would a law change mean for Northern Irish women?\n\nAbortion is illegal in the majority of cases, so Northern Irish women have to travel to England for a termination currently or risk prison-time by using pills bought online.\n\n\n\nThe Westminster amendment would allow women in Northern Ireland the same rights to a termination as women in the rest of the UK, without having to travel or risk imprisonment. This means abortion would be legal until up to 23 weeks and six days of pregnancy.\n\nWhy now?\n\nLast year, the Republic of Ireland voted to legalise abortion by a landslide. Since then there's been pressure on Northern Ireland to follow suit.\n\nLabour MPs Conor McGinn and Stella Creasy brought two amendments to the Northern Ireland Bill in July legalising same-sex marriage and decriminalising abortion. Both were carried by significant majorities after a highly-charged abortion debate in Westminster.\n\nLast month, the High Court in Belfast ruled that Northern Ireland's abortion laws breach the UK's human rights commitments, in a case brought by Belfast woman Sarah Ewart. She was denied a termination will carrying a baby with a medically-diagnosed fatal foetal abnormality.\n\nPhoto credit: Charles McQuillan - Getty Images More\n\nBoth same-sex marriage and abortion will become legal in Northern Ireland at midnight tonight (21 October 2019) if the Northern Ireland Assembly has not been restored. The devolved government there is currently suspended after collapsing in January 2017 due to policy disagreements.\n\nPro-choice groups have welcomed the law change, calling it a \"watershed moment\" for the country. But, pro-life campaigners and the church say no-one in the country has voted for the reforms.\n\n\n\nStory continues", "description": "But there's one hurdle to pass first.", "authors": ["Natalie Cornish"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iF.6s7JHS8yrlEt53dMTFw--~B/aD01MTM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/c8a1b9108ac0349e1fcaf50c479aa29d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
