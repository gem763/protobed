The bill is set to benefit a large number of transgender persons, alleviate the stigma, discrimination and abused against the marginalised community and will help bring them into the mainstream society.\n\nThe bill provides a mechanism for social, economic and educational empowerment of transgenders by defining their identity and rights to prohibit discrimination against them.\n\nA government statement said the bill will lead to inclusiveness and make them productive members of the society, it said.\n\n\"The Union Cabinet has approved the proposal to introduce the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019. The Bill will introduced in the ensuing session of the Parliament. The Bill provides a mechanism for their social, economic and educational empowerment,\" the statement said.\n\nBCCL\n\nDon't Miss 234 SHARES 15.6 K SHARES 6.3 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 3.6 K SHARES\n\nAccording to the bill, a transgender is a person whose \"gender does not match with the gender assigned to that person at birth and includes trans-man or trans-woman (whether or not such person has undergone Sex Reassignment Surgery or hormone therapy or laser therapy or such other therapy), person with intersex variations, gender- queer and person having such socio-cultural identities as kinner, hijra, aravani and jogta.\"\n\nThe bill will give the right to choose to a transgender person to be identified as a man, woman or transgender, irrespective of sex reassignment surgery and hormonal therapy.\n\nContentious in nature\n\nIt restricts recognition of gender identity, as it only provides for transgender persons to receive identity certificates recognising them as \u201ctransgender\u201d and therefore, excludes all other gender identities.\n\nThe bill is contentious because it requires transgender persons to go through a district magistrate and \"district screening committee\" to get certified as a transperson.\n\nThe committee would comprise a medical officer, a psychologist or psychiatrist, a district welfare officer, a government official, and a transgender person.\n\nSuch procedures will create an environment of abuse and violate the basic human right to privacy and dignity. The measure will only rob the already marginalised community of discretion, given such close scrutiny by the government.\n\nThe bill has already been criticised for being hastily passed in Lok Sabha in 2018.\n\nBCCL\n\nThough the bill prohibits discrimination against a transgender person in areas such as education, employment and healthcare, it does not spell out the measures taken to create such opportunities for the community.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that the right to self-identification of gender is part of the right to dignity and autonomy under Article 21 of the Constitution. However, an objective criteria is required to ascertain one\u2019s gender to be eligible for benefits.\n\nThe Bill includes terms like \u2018trans-men\u2019, \u2018trans-women\u2019, persons with \u2018intersex variations\u2019 and \u2018gender-queers\u2019 in its definition of transgender persons. However, these terms have not been defined.\n\nIt still remains unclear as to how such laws would apply to transgender persons who do not identify with the two genders.", "description": "In a step for social and economic justice of the transgender community, the government has approved The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019.
