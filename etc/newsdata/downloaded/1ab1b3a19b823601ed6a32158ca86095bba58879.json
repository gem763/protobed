Add Interest\n\nThese days, Houston is the most diverse big city in America and Ortega is among its most celebrated chefs. In many ways, Ortega embodies the practical yet ambitious spirit of the changing city.\n\nAs ten presidential candidates arrive in Houston this week for the third round of Democratic debates, Houstonians say they will find America\u2019s future: young, multicultural and, two years after Hurricane Harvey laid waste to parts of this city, reckoning with the very real threat of climate change.\n\nAhead of the debate on Thursday, hosted by ABC News, Ortega said he hopes the candidates can learn from the city\u2019s welcoming approach to immigration and its pragmatic approach to hot-button issues.\n\n\u201cI came here with no money in my pocket and I crossed the Rio Grande illegally and today I have 500 employees and I am a James Beard Award winner,\u201d said Ortega, who has cooked quesadillas for former President Bill Clinton and served dinner to another former president, George H. W. Bush, and his chief of staff James Baker -- including making an emergency run to procure Bush\u2019s preferred skim milk as coffee was about to be served.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be able to contribute a hundred percent of who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cI will vote for someone who says, \u2018I understand my great, great grandfather was an immigrant, and this country is founded on that.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith 2.3 million residents, sprawling Houston is the fourth biggest city in the country, while according to the most recent census, close to two-thirds of the population is non-white and a quarter of residents are foreign-born.\n\nIlana Panich-Linsman for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\n\u201cIf you want to get a sense of where the United States will be 20, 25 years from now, take a look at Houston,\u201d Sylvester Turner, the city\u2019s Democratic mayor, said in a telephone interview. The U.S. Census Bureau projects non-Hispanic whites will represent a minority of the U.S. population within the next three decades.\n\nHouston\u2019s boom and bust and boom again has tracked with the fortunes of America\u2019s energy sector. During the oil boom of the 1960s and '70s, white men poured into Houston\u2019s to fill jobs in the oil industry and related sectors.\n\nBut since 1982, when that boom collapsed, the vast majority of the city's growth has come from African Americans, Latinos and Asians, and the non-Hispanic white population has fallen from two-thirds to one-third in Houston, making it something of a \"microcosm of the world,\u201d said Stephen Klineberg, a Houston sociologist who conducts the annual Kinder Institute Houston Area Survey.\n\n\"Houston is a logical place to hold this debate in a way it would not have been 25 years ago because it's so much a manifestation of what's happening in America,\" Klineberg said.\n\nHouston's demographic shift has also changed the city's politics. Since 2005, when the city was mostly split along party lines, it has grown more Democratic and is now reliably blue -- a move that is being seen, though at a far more gradual clip, across Texas.\n\nThe state has not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994, though in 2018 Democrats picked up two states in the state Senate, and 12 Texas House seats, and made additional gains in local races. Former El Paso Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who will be on the presidential debate stage on Thursday, received more votes than any Democrat has in Texas history when he narrowly lost his challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nChanges in Houston have also pushed economic inequality and jobs to the forefront of voters\u2019 minds. While Houston is still known as the \u201cenergy capital of the world\u201d and is home to a large share of Texas\u2019 oil and gas-related jobs, well-paying jobs for people without a college education have largely dried up.\n\nA sense of vulnerability has also taken hold in Houston following Hurricane Harvey, which destroyed or damaged some 40,000 homes -- and, according to Klineberg, more than seven in 10 Houstonians say they expect flooding to become more commonplace.\n\nIn Harvey's wake, the city has taken a proactive response to climate change and the state's heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Mayor Turner is the co-chair of a group called \u201cClimate Mayors,\u201d and has helped spearhead a national effort to drive down the cost of renewable energy.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s debate, he said he hoped to hear candidates talk about how they can remove bureaucratic hurdles so that cities hit by storms can access promised federal aid more quickly.\n\nBut even if Texas is less of the deep-red state it once was, its Democrats bring a Texas flavor to their politics.\n\n\"Houston, while at the center of all these changes, remains a laissez-faire, Texas anti-government kind of city,\" Klineberg said. \"So as we move Democratic, we do not necessarily become more enamored of government intervention and government programs.\"\n\nScott Dalton for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Jim \u201cMattress Mack\u201d McIngvale. Long known as the energetic TV pitchman for his Gallery Furniture retail chain, McIngvale was hailed as a hero after Harvey when he opened some of his stores as makeshift shelters.\n\nMcIngvale is Republican-leaning, though he describes himself as \u201chalf capitalist and half social worker\u201d and said he hasn\u2019t decided who to support in 2020. But he said he is more interested in hearing about how to bolster the country\u2019s skilled trade workforce and less interested in talk about mitigating climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Texan. So I think global warming is a bit overdone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issues are, I want a good job \u2026 a good place for their kids to go to school and a vibrant community that supports them without being too onerous.\u201d\n\nBut while Houstonians might be thinking about the issues facing them directly, Democrats in the city -- as in the country more broadly -- might be principally interested in which candidate appears most likely to beat President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe old adage that all politics is local? Not true. All politics is national,\u201d said Rice University pollster and political science professor Bob Stein. \u201cWhat you see at every level, even school board races, the strongest issue for voters, especially for Democrats, they just want to know who\u2019s a Trump supporter and who\u2019s a good guy.\u201d\n\nGina Calanni, a Democrat in the Texas House who defeated a two-term Republican in 2018 in a district won two years earlier by President Trump, said she expects access to high-quality healthcare to be a \u201cpivotal\u201d issue in 2020, especially for female voters outraged by Texas\u2019 refusal to accept $100 billion in federal money to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cA lot of women don\u2019t have the luxury of an annual checkup,\u201d said Calanni, who survived a bout with cervical cancer.\n\nAs far as what to do after the debate, Mayor Turner suggests they take a page from the late traveler and TV host Anthony Bourdain and head out to Burns Original BBQ to eat red beans, short ends, original sausage and potato salad on the restaurant\u2019s porch.\n\n\u201cGo to a place like that,\u201d he said. \u201cGo in and visit communities where the people won\u2019t be in the audience at the debate \u2026 Sometimes, you have to bypass the fundraiser and go to where people live.\u201d\n\nOf course the presidential hopefuls also have the option of heading to one of Ortega\u2019s restaurants, like Hugo\u2019s or Xochi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable to be part of these iconic times,\u201d the chef said. \u201cI would love to cook for all of them!\u201d", "description": "As ten presidential candidates arrive in Houston for ABC News' Democratic debate, Houstonians say the city represents America\u2019s future.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/houston-gty-er-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
