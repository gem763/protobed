So, it\u2019s kind of two different worlds going in opposite directions.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what his advice to aspiring actors trying to break into the industry would be, the producer and performer had this to say:\n\n\u201cFor me, in my humble opinion, it\u2019s about doing things the way that you believe in. If you believe in something enough, if you have the right karma you\u2019ll get in there and make it happen.\u201d\n\nWith the El Gouna festival handing out awards to frontrunners in the regional film industry, Seagal was asked whether nominations for accolades like the Golden Globes, Emmy Awards and Oscars meant anything to him personally.\n\n\u201cIn the highest spiritual sense, they don\u2019t mean a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in the normal human world they mean a lot.\u201d\n\nBEST ACTRESS HEND SABRY\n\nReceiving the award for Best Actress at the El Gouna Film Festival was Tunisia\u2019s Hend Sabry.\n\nThe 39-year-old is not only an actress, but a lawyer, and the first Arab woman judge at the oldest film festival in the world, Venice.\n\nOn screen, Sabry is known for being a fearless, feminist artist and her latest movie, Noura\u2019s Dream, made its regional debut at El Gouna.\n\nHend Sabry in Noura\u2019s Dream\n\nIt tells of a wife whose abusive husband is in jail and who herself risks imprisonment to start a new life with her lover.\n\nSabry spoke to Inspire about how, following the film's screening, audiences were taken aback by the gritty movie and its punchy script.\n\n\u201cThere was two to three minutes silence after the movie ended,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the claps were a little bit, I don\u2019t know, scared, shocked, surprised. Which is actually what cinema should create as a reaction.\u201d\n\nWhen pushed as to why she believed cinema-goers reacted this way, the actress pointed to a change in the way movies have been made in Tunisia for decades.\n\nHend Sabry speaks to Euronews\n\n\u201cThis non-judgment throughout the film with all the characters, this grey area where the characters are, is new to Arab audiences,\u201d she says. \u201cArab audiences are more used to the filmmaker that thinks for them or judges for them - or does their homework.\u201d\n\nThe actress, who has also recently released the horror movie The Blue Elephant 2, says that whilst she wouldn\u2019t turn down an opportunity to work in the United States, it isn\u2019t her top priority.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more needed in my Arab identity portraying different characters, than in Hollywood playing stereotypes, or creating an Arab identity that is one dimensional,\u201d she says.\n\nSUCCESS OF THE HANDMAID\u2019S TALE\n\nAnother lady people clamoured to see at El Gouna was Lindsay Sloane, the head of scripted television and development at MGM Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nShe delivered a presentation on her handling of the production for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, the award-winning drama adapted from the dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood.\n\nScene from Hulu series The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, starred by Elisabeth Moss\n\nSloane shared her thoughts on the popularity of the television series to date.\n\n\u201cI think when we were making it, we knew we had something special and we knew we were making a good show,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you never know if it\u2019s going to resonate with an audience. We\u2019re very lucky. Our writers just started breaking season four and it will come out some time next year.\u201d\n\nMaking comparisons between the early days of Hollywood\u2019s film industry and the emerging sector in the Middle East and North Africa, Sloane said it was filmmakers\u2019 knack for storytelling which united them worldwide.\n\nMGM\u2019s Lindsay Sloane speaks to Euronews\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of similarities with what\u2019s going on in the region and what\u2019s happening in the States,\u201d she says. \u201cYou realise that people make art, and celebrate art, in very similar ways.\u201d\n\nSloane is respected for having blazed a career path in a male dominated media and entertainment space.\n\nShe was the only female in her department during her early days at MGM, and before leaving El Gouna to fly back to L.A, she had these words of wisdom for women looking to follow a similar path to hers:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say, have an opinion and don\u2019t be afraid to express it.\u201d\n\nMore from El Gouna Film Festival:\n\nWhat were the highlights of El Gouna Film Festival\u2019s third edition?\n\nGive Up The Ghost wins Best Arab Short Film\n\nHow can film play a part in refugee crisis?
