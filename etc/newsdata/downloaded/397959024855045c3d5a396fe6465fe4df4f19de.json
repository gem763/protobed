I thought Juventus would be one of the dangers, but I watched them the other night and they are not going to win it.\n\n\"When Bayern Munich rinsed Tottenham the other week, I didn\u2019t think they were the team to beat. I didn\u2019t think that at all if I\u2019m being honest. I thought they looked quite open.\"\n\n(Image: BELGA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAnd Merson reckons Liverpool, who lifted the 2018/19 trophy after beating Tottenham in the final, are contenders again this year.\n\nHe added: \"I still think Liverpool are the team to beat. They lost in the final two seasons ago and then won it last season. Who\u2019s got better form than that?\n\n\"They hardly ever lose at home, if ever. No one wants to go and play at Anfield. I still think Liverpool will be there or thereabouts come the end of the competition.\"", "description": "Raheem Sterling scored an 11-minute hat-trick as Manchester City came from behind to beat Atalanta 5-1 on Tuesday", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Belga Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13192820.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DDP_CHP__2584mersonJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
