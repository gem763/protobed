It is technically legal but morally abhorrent.\n\nFacebook employs staff who are educated at our schools and universities, cared for by our health service and protected by our police.\n\nIt benefits from our expertise and infrastructure but balks at making a fair contribution towards their cost. When firms such as this leech off the state it is the rest of us who pick up the bill through higher taxes.\n\nWe need new laws that force global giants to pay taxes in the countries where they sell and make products.\n\nEU deal fragile\n\n(Image: via REUTERS)\n\nBoris Johnson was forced to the negotiating table after Parliament rightly blocked his path to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAgainst the odds there is now a chance that an agreement with the EU can be reached.\n\nThere is still much to do in a short space of time to nail down a workable deal.
