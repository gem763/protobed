Not as a coach, not as an assistant, but as a player.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s confusing,\u201d she asserted. \u201cYour entire team\u2019s focus and motivation is lost and defeated before you even start.\u201d\n\nGrace said that her team\u2019s spirit of \u201cYes, we can!\u201d was quickly replaced by \u201cWhy try?\u201d\n\nShe explained that when the boy\u2019s hitting ability gave the opposing team an edge of a couple of runs, her team of female athletes could not recover and ended up losing.\n\nGrace observed how allowing biological men to play women\u2019s sports is defeating the goal of an \u201cequal playing field\u201d federal law is supposed to protect. She said many female athletes who have to compete against males will lose out on sports scholarships to colleges.\n\nA recent study in Sweden has shown that biological males who claim to be transgender women still retained considerable advantages over biological females in strength and muscle mass, even after a full year of hormone therapy.\n\n\u201cDespite the robust increases in muscle mass and strength in [transgender men], the [transgender women] were still stronger and had more muscle mass following 12 months of treatment,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThese findings add new knowledge that could be relevant when evaluating transwomen\u2019s eligibility to compete in the women\u2019s category of athletic competitions.\u201d\n\nIn another study, researchers concluded that male athletes who claim to be female hold an \u201cintolerable\u201d advantage over biological female athletes.\n\nThree professors \u2014 two in bioethics and one in physiology \u2014 noted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is allowing \u201ctransgender women\u201d to compete against biological females if their testosterone is below 10 nmol/L. However, even that level is \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than that of biological females, they asserted.\n\nThe researchers also stated that \u201cindirect effects of testosterone will not be altered by hormone therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, hormone therapy will not alter bone structure, lung volume or heart size of the transwoman athlete, especially if she transitions postpuberty, so natural advantages including joint articulation, stroke volume and maximal oxygen uptake will be maintained,\u201d they explained.\n\n\u201cWe conclude that the advantage to transwomen afforded by the IOC guidelines is an intolerable unfairness,\u201d state the professors.", "description": "A female high school athlete said on Tuesday that having to compete with men on the field crushes the dreams of women athletes.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/female-athlete-protests-transgender-ideology-supreme-court-bbn-screenshot-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
