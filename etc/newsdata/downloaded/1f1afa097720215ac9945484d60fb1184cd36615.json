He stuck out from the more orderly politicians \u2013 a bumbling, peroxide-haired loose cannon who spouts Latin. Boris has always used comedy and bluster to paper over inadequacy and problems. Comedy was a tool to distract, sending the focus elsewhere the way a magician does. That method has gone now. Like frozen snow from the top of a slanting shed roof, it has slid off and landed with a real thump.\n\nNow we\u2019re in falling-to-bits mode and seeing an angry, frustrated Boris. At first he seemed to think it was all quite easy against a \u201cmugwump\u201d leader of the opposition. But Corbyn now has a bit of traction. Boris is a boxer in round four, frustrated by his opponent, and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B. The closest we got to this in the past was the 2013 interview with Eddie Mair who told him: \u201cYou\u2019re a nasty piece of work aren\u2019t you?\u201d We\u2019re seeing him under pressure. The way he is hugging himself in the Commons with arms folded, it is as if he is trying to shield himself from an unexpected hailstorm. The regular trusted game plan is not working any more. When you\u2019re prime minister it\u2019s an entirely different level of scrutiny. His comfort blanket has been taken away and he has to find a new strategy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shielding himself from a hail storm \u2026 Boris Johnson in the House of Commons. Photograph: Jessica Taylor/HOC\n\nI met Boris once, briefly, at an awards ceremony. As we passed each other he sort of gave a nod and a grunt. His body language is like when a child mimics an elephant. To do an impression of him when he\u2019s getting into Latin mode you need real octopus gesticulations. He should have been a compere at the Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club.\n\nIn the Spitting Image days, they had to invent a comic persona for certain characters like John Major. You certainly don\u2019t need that with Boris or Trump. It feels as if the pendulum has swung from the homogenised, bland tidiness of David Cameron and Nick Clegg right over to the political equivalent of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer hitting each other with frying pans.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nJames Graham, playwright\n\n\u2018The week Westminster jumped the shark\u2019\n\nIf we must have relentless high drama in our once relatively stable parliamentary democracy (The Crown took a year off while they recast \u2013 can\u2019t we?) then Johnson and his showrunner Dominic Cummings had probably aspired to something a bit more \u201cHBO\u201d, a bit \u201csubscription model\u201d. The sword-swinging violence but also the classiness of Game of Thrones. Theirs would be a shocking, bloody first season with enough larger-than-life characters and an unpredictable approach to killing off audience favourites that it might just run and run and run.\n\nThe classicist Johnson (whose political hero is Pericles) may have even been hifalutin enough to eye-up the Greek theatre format, which created the very conditions for the birth of democracy itself. However, there\u2019s another format that in times of turmoil plumps for an improbably high death toll, the swallowing up of story and the return of cancelled characters \u2013 and that\u2019s the soap opera.\n\nPlay Video 0:56 Boris Johnson rambles through attempt to recite police caution \u2013 video\n\nPoint of order, Mister Speaker, there is absolutely nothing wrong with British soaps. I didn\u2019t see a straight play outside of panto until my late teens but gobbled up Emmerdale and Corrie and \u2019Stenders, getting my neighbours to tape hours of episodes if we ever went on holiday. I wouldn\u2019t be a playwright without them. When they work it\u2019s because a loyal audience who have invested in the longrunning undulations of fictional lives are rewarded with plausible outcomes seeded in for months in advance if not years. They work less well when a new exec arrives and wants to shake things to make some noise.\n\nAnd so we have the week of jumping the shark in Westminster. Wiping out 20 \u2013 20! \u2013 rebel Tories in one go (for committing the same crime that Boris and Rees-Mogg did under May). It was meant to feel like the Red Wedding but is in fact just the plane crash in Emmerdale. The expulsion from the formerly-known-as-the-Conservative party of Nicholas Soames by whip Mark Spencer was meant to be the killing of traitor Alan Bradley by that noble Blackpool tram, but it was more the beloved Tiffany Mitchell run down by Frank Butcher one fateful night in Albert Square. The early prorogation of Parliament aspired to invoke that carefree derring-do of the lesbian kiss in Brookside but (rightly) engendered the queasy unease of David Wicks fancying his own daughter. Chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s character had incidentally indicated he would leave the show if that happened, but has miraculously developed classic soap amnesia. And so we are left with John Major returning Dirty Den-style to inject some old-school heft by suing the government for being illegal (Bouncer\u2019s dream).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Like Barbara Windsor leaving the Queen Vic \u2026 expelled Conservative MP Kenneth Clarke, far left, in the House of Commons. Photograph: Jessica Taylor/AFP/Getty Images\n\nI say none of this with writer\u2019s relish, incidentally. I don\u2019t revel in the wealth of potential material. Some formats need rebooting and starting afresh, no question, but you juxtapose that with the comfort of constants. Ken Clarke being forced out of the Conservative party after 50 years feels like Barbara Windsor no longer being behind the bar of the Queen Vic. It has all the foreboding of the ravens leaving the Tower. You can\u2019t help but feel the storyliners may have watched the show, sure, are maybe able to talk convincingly about the canon. But they just don\u2019t quite like it enough. They\u2019re not true fans. And an audience can always tell.\n\nBridget Christie\n\n\u2018This is a spectacularly bad run of gigs\u2019\n\n\u201cHe thinks the friends of this country are in Tehran, in the Kremlin, and in Caracas. I think he\u2019s Caracas!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s worried about trade deals, but there\u2019s only one chlorinated chicken I can see in this room!\u201d \u201cThe police have to learn a caution \u2026 what is it?

Even worse than May\u2019s coughing one and that dancing one, and she\u2019s a woman, and, as we all know, women aren\u2019t funny at all. He\u2019s doing the kind of material Alan Partridge would do if he suddenly found himself as prime minister, and none of it\u2019s working.\n\nPlay Video 2:01 Caracas and chlorinated chicken: Johnson's first PMQs clash with Corbyn \u2013 video highlights\n\nDuring his first PMQs, the PM had the demeanour of a comic who\u2019s had to dash straight to a gig after giving birth. This came after his catastrophic address to the nation on Monday, where he was drowned out by the noise of protesters. There wasn\u2019t much he could have done to rescue this one. Watching it, I thought about the daytime show I did to 80 screaming babies at Soho theatre once. It\u2019s an unwinnable situation. You can\u2019t negotiate with a baby or with a hostile crowd you can\u2019t even see.\n\nBut he\u2019s had missed opportunities, too. When Phillip Lee crossed the floor of the Commons and defected to the Lib Dems, instead of ignoring it and letting it rattle him, Johnson should have owned it. He should have committed to the bumbling, oafish posh-boy character he does, wrestled him to the ground, sat on him and farted. His fans would\u2019ve loved that.\n\nPlay Video 0:34 Tory MP Phillip Lee defects to Lib Dems midway through Johnson speech \u2013 video\n\nWere Johnson a fellow comedian, or literally anyone other than Boris Johnson, my heart would go out to him. But he isn\u2019t and so it doesn\u2019t. What we\u2019re watching now is a man realising that the character he invented for himself in order to get something he didn\u2019t want doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re prime minister. It was fine for panel shows and PR opportunities, and for getting him into No 10, but he didn\u2019t think it through. He failed to write the final act, and now he\u2019s trapped in his own clown, in a costume that doesn\u2019t fit any more, being forced to perform in a circus that\u2019s packing up around him. How funny is that?\n\nCritic Mark Lawson\n\n\u2018A mock-Churchillian mocked by TV\u2019\n\nIn November, it will be 30 years since the proceedings of the House of Commons were first televised. Opponents of the move argued that politicians might come across as false (or falser) because speeches pitched at the chamber would be too shouty and spitty for the lower-key medium. This position echoed the long hostility to TV of Winston Churchill, who perhaps knew closeups would not suit his grand operatic oratory.\n\nSupporters of parliamentary broadcasting argued that good politicians would find a way to mediate their speeches between the interior audience and the viewers beyond, while bad politicians would be found out by the camera\u2019s scrutiny.\n\nBoris Johnson, the ultimate mock-Churchillian, was this week mockingly exposed on and by television.\n\nPlay Video 0:15 Boris Johnson appears to call Jeremy Corbyn a 'great big girl's blouse' \u2013 video\n\nThe best public performing politicians of the mass-media era \u2013 Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair \u2013 had the ability to recalibrate their delivery for outside arena, indoor hall, media interview, TV address to the nation. Even Barack Obama, an astonishing high public orator, sometimes struggled to find the lower keys.\n\nAlthough often ridiculed as a speaker, Jeremy Corbyn has recognisably different registers for a campaign rally, the despatch box, and a Laura Kuenssberg interview. In contrast, Theresa May spoke the same way in any situation, a consequence of the robotic quality identified by the Guardian\u2019s John Crace.\n\nJohnson\u2019s problem is that, while his style is far more engaging and populist than May\u2019s, he also has only one \u2013 channelling Churchill. Although Johnson\u2019s hosting of Have I Got News For You? earned him a reputation for being \u201cgood on television\u201d, the impact came from a mismatch between his grand manner and the usual demeanour of a TV presenter, in the same way that it is amusing to see Brian Blessed booming lines from an Autocue.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A comic figure \u2026 Boris Johnson on Have I Got News For You in 2002. Photograph: BBC\n\nAnd, whereas Churchill had an inherent gravitas, Johnson is essentially a comic figure \u2013 the joke on him rather than, as he hopes, from him. As a result, his oratorical style is a jokey karaoke of Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour, bizarrely arrhythmic vocal rises and dives, punctuated, as when he was barracking Corbyn this week, by hollered insults presumably perfected at the Oxford Union and Bullingdon dinners.\n\nWhat it means for a politician to be a good media performer is partly a matter of personality, but also of content and context. Philip Hammond, long pilloried as a dreary speaker, was electrifying this week in both broadcast and parliamentary appearances, because what he had to say was so devastating. (Geoffrey Howe made an equivalent transformation in the final days of Thatcherism.)\n\nJohnson\u2019s problem is that, drilled by his wacky handler \u201cDom\u201d (increasingly seeming to be an abbreviation of Dominatrix) Cummings to keep his public utterances free of possibly incriminating substance, he has been reduced to a series of verbal and facial tics that are not even his own. Cummings has kept Johnson off the box as far as possible. However, while the Commons is still sitting, its proceedings will be televised; and the prime minister\u2019s inability to adjust his high, ripe style to the more conversational form has shattered his myth as a charismatic communicator.\n\nIt seems fitting that Johnson should have been exposed as the third-rate Churchill impersonator he is by the medium that the original so feared.", "description": "Impressionist Jon Culshaw, playwright James Graham, comedian Bridget Christie and critic Mark Lawson on the prime minister\u2019s opening week in Westminster", "authors": ["James Graham", "Mark Lawson", "Jon Culshaw", "Bridget Christie"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/426a483c775cde33f8d971f0326a0a2dc9812607/0_71_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dceb7f40f9f2d56fe7e93bbc8dda4035", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
