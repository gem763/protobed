The coming election is just the prelude. This month should have seen Britain\u2019s formal withdrawal from the EU, on Boris Johnson\u2019s deal, prior to serious trade talks with Brussels next year. The election should have taken place after, not before, formal withdrawal, to elect a parliament to conduct those negotiations \u2013 and with the outcome of those talks then validated by a referendum. That would have been dignified and sensible.\n\nEven Tories think an election is risky \u2013 because of Boris Johnson | Rafael Behr Read more\n\nIn theory, that could still happen. The House of Lords could this week delay the election bill \u2013 which tears up a constitutional measure, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, without even bothering to repeal it. If the Lords were not so bloated and gutless, it would delay the bill. In truth, the upper house is not fit for the job.\n\nUp to now, the anti-Johnson majority in the Commons had a golden opportunity to take command of Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn could have used his leverage to force through a soft Brexit. His ineptitude in dealing with the minority parties lost him that chance. He shot himself in the foot. Meanwhile the SNP and Liberal Democrats sensed they would win more votes with Corbyn still at Labour\u2019s helm than if they waited until next spring \u2013 even at the risk of putting Johnson and his hard Brexit back in Downing Street. They put party before country. Never has there been a more cynical Commons than this one.\n\nJohnson has not even had to promise \u2013 for what that is worth \u2013 to \u201ctake no deal off the table\u201d. He has merely returned Brexit to square one and concentrated on what he craves: a safe majority. The polls may be unreliable but, with a divided, demoralised opposition, the odds must be on Johnson winning. He will have his unamendable deal passed by January.\n\nThat is not the end. Next year comes the real moment of truth: proper negotiations on a long-term trade deal with Brussels. Remember, Britain will still be in a transitional customs union, and it will start to be hit by a tornado of economic bad news. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research says Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit will cost a staggering \u00a370bn or 4% of GDP, the most savage self-inflicted wound since the hundred years war. Johnson has accepted the EU customs union for Northern Ireland. Perhaps he will eventually see that what\u2019s good for Northern Ireland is good for the whole nation.\n\n\u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist", "description": "A win for Boris Johnson would lead to a ruinous hard Brexit, says Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins", "authors": ["Simon Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b6f99206a168ae3128088392efd8608a66d4683/0_250_5404_3242/master/5404.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cbb7c52718c710f226a272ba7fc09094", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
