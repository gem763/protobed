It gave no indication whether or when purchases might resume.\n\nPhone calls to the commerce and finance ministries weren't answered on Friday, a national holiday in China.\n\nBeijing imposed tariffs of 25% on American farm goods and ordered importers to stop buying soybeans, the biggest U.S. export to China, in response to President Donald Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese goods.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will delay by two weeks a planned increase in tariffs on some Chinese imports, which he described as \"a gesture of good will.\" The delay could signal a de-escalation of tensions ahead of trade negotiations that are slated to resume in Washington next month, although expectations are tempered, analysts said.\n\nA Commerce Ministry spokesman said Thursday that importers were asking American suppliers for prices of soybeans and pork.
