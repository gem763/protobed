You have time to catch up and make new memories, and you don\u2019t have to pay for a hotel. But you\u2019ll pay in other ways, such as having to sleep on an air mattress and sacrificing alone time.\n\nThat's why SmarterTravel is recommending 10 ways you can survive an extended stay with relatives this holiday season:\n\nMake your bed more comfortable\n\nRelegated to a futon, air mattress, or pull-out couch? There are a few things you can do to make your sleeping arrangement more comfortable. Air mattresses get colder than real beds (the air inside cools overnight, making you chilly). Pad it with extra blankets, or use a sleep sack, which is easy to pack and provides a ton of warmth. I\u2019ve used this one by Blue Water to stay warm while sleeping on planes and while camping, and it really works.\n\nPush the air mattress up against the wall if possible so your pillows don\u2019t fall off while you sleep, and put a blanket or a yoga mat underneath the mattress to make it less noisy when you move around.\n\nWill you be bunking on a blow-up mattress? Move it against a wall to keep your pillows from falling off and put a blanket or a yoga mat underneath the mattress to make it less noisy when you move around.

This mask is contoured to allow for eye movement during sleep, but still prevents light from getting in.\n\nEarplugs are also essential if you\u2019re a light sleeper (or just go to bed earlier/get up later than other people in the house). Or, bring a travel-sized white noise machine if you really want to drown out the world.\n\nStuck in the living room? You could go all out and pack a privacy pop-up indoor bed tent if you want to make a statement about the importance of alone time.\n\nHow to be a good holiday houseguest: 9 ways to avoid wearing out your welcome\n\nDon't forget to breathe\n\nAn air purifier can help you breathe easier if you're staying with smokers or pets.

If you\u2019re staying in an environment that you\u2019re not used to (for example, sharing a house with smokers or pets when you\u2019re allergic), bring along a tiny travel air purifier for your room. This can make a big difference and help you breathe easier.\n\nGet some quiet time\n\nNeed to get out of the house? Offer to walk your host's dog. Or if there's a relative you're close to, invite them along so you can catch up. (Photo: Halfpoint, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nSpending time with other people 24/7 can be tough. But you\u2019re going to be a better guest and family member if you take some solo time to decompress each day. Take a walk, or excuse yourself to take a nap and use the time to sleep or read. If you\u2019re coming home to a deadline-driven family, you could appear busy while also carving out alone time by offering to run errands on your own.\n\nStaying in a hotel over the holidays? 9 ways to make it feel like home\n\nStay charged and connected\n\nIf a big group is staying at your family\u2019s house, the Wi-Fi will get overwhelmed quickly. If it\u2019s important to you to stay online, bring along a Wi-Fi hotspot so you avoid the frustration of slow Internet. A travel-sized power strip can also save the day if everyone is fighting over one outlet to charge gadgets.\n\nWork out\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot is so popular. Whether you head out in the morning for a quick run or get a day pass to a local gym, working out can give you an excuse to get out of the house for a bit. Exercise is also a proven stress-reducer and mood enhancer, and will also make you feel less guilty about eating all that home-cooked food.\n\nKnit running shoes like Nike Frees are lightweight and easy to pack, so bring a pair with you. You can also use them to go for a walk with the family after a big holiday dinner.\n\nCan\u2019t get out of the house? Pack exercise bands, which take up minimal space and can be used for an easy at-home workout (or to stretch after a long travel day or a rough night on the couch).\n\nThe best travel workout gear: This stuff will earn its place in your luggage\n\nDon't dominate the bathroom\n\nChances are, you won\u2019t have a private bathroom while staying with family, so don\u2019t leave your toiletries scattered all over the sink and shower. This innovative bag is a great solution, as it lets you lay out all your toiletries on a flat surface to use; when you\u2019re done, simply fold it up and take it back to your room.\n\nProvide your own climate control\n\nUnlike at a hotel, you don\u2019t get control over the thermostat when staying with family. If you know the house is going to be cold, pack extra layers. In shoe-free houses, travel slippers keep you comfy. Merino wool sweaters are easy to layer without looking out of place, and a pashmina can double as a blanket. House too hot? A portable fan can be a lifesaver, and also act as a white noise machine at night.\n\nPack modest pajamas and a robe\n\nYou probably don\u2019t think twice about what you pack for sleepwear at a hotel, but you\u2019ll want something a little more modest if you\u2019re staying in someone\u2019s home. Don\u2019t forget to pack pajamas and a robe you won\u2019t be embarrassed to be seen in, for those middle-of-the-night bathroom trips.\n\nBring board games\n\nThe combination of the right family and the right board game can turn into a yearly tradition. (Photo: vgajic/Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nWorried about being bored? Pack travel-sized games that are fun for the whole family. Family Feud, HedBanz, UNO, and Scrabble are all good choices (depending on how competitive the crowd is).\n\nOffer to grocery shop, cook, or buy dinner\n\nTry to make your visit as easy on the host as possible. Just because it\u2019s your family doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re responsible for cleaning up after you and cooking every meal. Show up with a restaurant gift card to let them know a few meals are on you, or offer to go grocery shopping and cook for everyone while you\u2019re there.\n\nBe appreciative\n\nYour presence is not your present. Make sure to show appreciation to your host for putting you up. A thank-you note is never a bad idea. Some good gift ideas include: a bottle of wine and a wine chiller, a gift basket full of tasty treats, an easy-to-care-for plant, or a framed family photo.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2019/10/26/holiday-travel-10-strategies-surviving-your-stay-with-family/4088350002/", "description": "Staying with family saves you from paying for a hotel.
