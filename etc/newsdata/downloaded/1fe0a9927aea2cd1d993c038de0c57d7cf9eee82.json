The comedy heavily referenced the lack of equal rights that woman can face in the work place.\n\nDavis won an Oscar in 1989 for her supporting role in \"The Accidental Tourist\" but is perhaps best known for playing one of the titular characters in the 1991 film \"Thelma & Louise\".\n\nThe Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media aims to target children ages 11 and under with its work. According to the institute's website, it has influenced gender portrayal in family films such as \"Inside Out\" and \"Monsters University\".\n\nThe Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award is given to an \"individual in the motion picture industry whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the industry\" and was named after the Danish actor.", "description": "U.S. actress Geena Davis was awarded an honorary Oscar at the 2019 Governors Awards on Sunday for her efforts to promote a more balanced representation of women onscreen.", "authors": ["Vicky Mckeever"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106207467-1572276171721geenadavis.jpg?v=1572276187", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
