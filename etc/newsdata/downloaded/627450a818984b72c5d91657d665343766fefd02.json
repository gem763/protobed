PRECIOUS-Gold drops for 4th session as improved risk appetite weighs\n\n* Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust fell 0.82% on Monday\n\n* Chinese CPI, PPI data better than expected\n\n* Investors await ECB policy meeting on Thursday\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Karthika Suresh Namboothiri\n\nSept 10 (Reuters) - Gold prices dropped for a fourth\n\nstraight session on Tuesday as risk appetite remained buoyed by\n\nhopes for global stimulus and expectations of a possible thawing\n\nin the Sino-U.S. trade war.\n\nSpot gold was down 0.6% at $1,490.10 per ounce, as of\n\n0650 GMT, after hitting its lowest since Aug. 13 at $1,486\n\nearlier in the session.\n\nBullion prices have shed nearly 5% since hitting a more than\n\n6-year peak of $1,557 on Sept. 4.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.8% to $1,498.50 per ounce.\n\nData released earlier in the day showed China's August\n\nconsumer price index (CPI) rose above expectations, while the\n\nproducer price index (PPI), a key barometer of corporate\n\nprofitability, contracted less than expected, urging Beijing to\n\nstep up economic stimulus as its dispute with the United States\n\nintensifies. \"Globally we are seeing a shift back towards growth assets\n\nand that's coming at the cost of the safe-havens,\" said Michael\n\nMcCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n\n\"A lot has already been factored in about the effect of the\n\ntrade war on China. Better-than-expected numbers might suggest\n\nthat the impact might not be as deep as many thought.\"\n\nThe trade war between China and the United States has upset\n\nmarkets globally since it began more than a year ago, fanning\n\nconcerns of a global economic slowdown.\n\nHowever, markets took heart from their decision to hold\n\ntalks in early October in Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on\n\nMonday he did not see the threat of a recession as President\n\nDonald Trump seeks to revive trade negotiations, adding that he\n\nexpected a positive year ahead for the U.S. economy.\n\n\n\n\"If prices hold at $1,490, we might see gold steadying.\n\nHowever, gold's short-term trend is downward. If it breaks\n\nthrough $1,480, it could fall to $1,425,\" McCarthy said.\n\nInvestors now await the European Central Bank's meeting on\n\nThursday for clues on monetary policy easing. The ECB is all but\n\ncertain to introduce a package of monetary easing and stimulus\n\nmeasures, but markets doubt it will opt for a massive\n\nquantitative easing. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also widely expected to cut\n\ninterest rates next week.\n\n\"A resumption in U.S.-China trade talks along with\n\naccommodative monetary policy by global central banks has\n\nrenewed risk appetite for the current term,\" Phillip Futures\n\nsaid in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust , the world's\n\nlargest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.82% to 882.42\n\ntonnes on Monday. Among other precious metals, platinum XPT= dropped 1.2% to\n\n$935.20 per ounce, while palladium XPD= slipped to $1,542.34.\n\nSilver fell 0.2% to $17.92 per ounce.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold drops for 4th session as improved risk appetite weighs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED0M02I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
