The vote could come as soon as today. But the way they wound up wording it may end up giving the ride-sharing companies an immediate out once the inevitable challenges make it through the courts. (Insider)\n\nUber and Lyft\u2019s day of reckoning is here. California senators are set to vote as early as Tuesday on Assembly Bill 5, a proposed law that would expand many employment protections to drivers while potentially wreaking havoc on the company\u2019s balance sheets. The bill, as proposed in 2018 by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzales, would codify a three-part test to determine a worker\u2019s status as either an employee or independent contractor.\n\nThe Insider article describes AB5 as something that could \u201cdevastate Uber and Lyft\u2019s business model.\u201d That\u2019s a fair description because that\u2019s precisely what the legislation is intended to do while pretending to offer better worker protection. What they\u2019re trying to do is force the companies to treat the drivers as if they are regular, full-time employees instead of private contractors, meaning they would have to pay the same wages and benefits that all traditional businesses have to cover in California. That, of course, would price the ride-sharing companies out of the game almost instantly.\n\nBut as I suggested above, this effort may wind up failing. The Supreme Court has already ruled on who is or isn\u2019t a full-time employee and they apply a three-question test to make that determination. AB5 is forced to follow the same path, and the drivers probably don\u2019t qualify. As listed in the linked article, in order to be considered a private contractor, the employer must be able to show that the worker:\n\n1. is \u201cfree from the control and direction\u201d of the company that hired them while they perform their work.\n\n2. is performing work that falls \u201coutside the hiring entity\u2019s usual course or type of business.\u201d\n\n3. has their own independent business or trade beyond the job for which they were hired.\n\nAs to number one, the drivers are not under the direction and control of the company. They work when and where they feel like turning on the app. They decide which rides to take or pass on. That part seems pretty clear.\n\nFor number two, this may come down to a technicality, but the work of the drivers is, well\u2026 driving. Uber and Lyft don\u2019t operate any vehicles for hire. They run an app that people can load up on their phones and use with the company\u2019s approval.\n\nNumber three is the tricky one. Many (if not most) Uber and Lyft drivers are people who do it in their spare time for some extra cash and frequently have other jobs. Others are retired. But not all of them. There are some drivers I\u2019ve spoken to who are just out there hustling all day and driving for these companies has become a full-time job. So how would the rules apply to the entire body of drivers? That\u2019s a tougher one to call.\n\nMeanwhile, the two companies are pushing back against AB5 already. They are lobbying to have the state create a new, third classification of workers to cover the gig economy. It would be something between full-time employees and independent contractors. And if the legislature won\u2019t do it, they plan to take it to a public referendum next year.\n\nIn other words, this fight is far from over.
