Biden held a 10-point lead over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, according to a survey taken after Tuesday\u2019s debate that showed little immediate movement for the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders.\n\nMr. Biden was the top choice of 31% of potential Democratic primary voters and caucus-goers, followed by Ms. Warren of Massachusetts at 21% and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont at 18%, according to the Morning Consult poll released on Thursday. Those results were largely unchanged compared to pre-debate polling.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris was next at 7%, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, at 6%, entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3%, and Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas at 2% apiece.\n\nMs. Warren, who has caught or passed Mr. Biden in some recent polling, had a target on her back at the debate, with candidates such as Mr. Buttigieg pressing her to explain how she planned to pay for her universal \u201cMedicare for All\u201d health care proposal.\n\nThough there wasn\u2019t much immediate movement in the poll, Ms. Warren has gained 8 points of support compared to polling taken before the first debates in Miami in June, while Mr. Biden has lost 7 points of support.\n\nSupport for Mr. Sanders, Ms. Harris and Mr. Buttigieg was largely flat compared to June.\n\nThe new survey of 2,202 registered voters who said they may vote in a primary or caucus was taken on Wednesday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
