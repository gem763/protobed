A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and the underemployed also fell, declining 0.3 percent points to 6.9%, matching its lowest in nearly 19 years and just off the all-time low of 6.8%.\n\nGet the market reaction here.\n\nAlso, the jobless rate for Hispanics also hit a new record low, while the level for African Americans maintained its lowest ever.\n\nAt the same time, the economy saw another sluggish month of growth. The nonfarm payrolls count missed the 145,000 estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones; the expectation on the jobless rate was to hold steady at 3.7%.\n\nWages also were a disappointment, with average hourly earnings little changed over the month and up just 2.9% for the year, the lowest increase since July 2018.\n\nThe report comes amid uncertain times for the economy, with fears escalating that weakness abroad will bleed into the U.S. and possibly cause a recession. Readings earlier in the week showed continued contraction in manufacturing and a sharp decline in the much larger services industry.", "description": "The jobless rate dropped 0.2 percentage points to 3.5%, matching a level it last saw in December 1969.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox", "Fred Imbert", "Silvia Amaro"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103429200-GettyImages-501447642.jpg?v=1570123593", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
