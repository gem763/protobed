In 2011, the area was struck by an earthquake that unleashed a tsunami on the coast and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.\n\nBut as Japan's population ages, the resilience of residents to deal with hardship in the disaster-prone country appears to be eroding.\n\n\"Elderly people have told me that they are ready to give up,\" said Kenichi Bamba, the head of Bridge for Fukushima, a volunteer group that had come to help with the clean-up.\n\n\"As Japan grows older, social networks that support communities will begin to break down. Something needs to be put in its place,\" he said.\n\nElderly people rest at an evacuation center in Date City, Fukushima Prefecture, on Wednesday.

Everything I have has been destroyed.\"\n\nTaniguchi doesn't think her house can be salvaged, and said she will likely knock it down, and may even move out of the area.\n\nAs many as 300 households in the neighborhood would need help from volunteers over coming weeks, says Bamba.\n\n\"It will take 10 people about three days to clean each house,\" he said.\n\nBut with Typhoon Hagibis aftermath stretching responders in other parts of Japan, including Tokyo, volunteers able to help in Fukushima may be in short supply, he said.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "When a river in Fukushima Prefecture overflowed on Sunday at the height of Typhoon Hagibis, 700 homes were flooded, many belonging to elderly residents too frail to clean up and repair their water-logged houses.
