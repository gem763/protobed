This was the weakest headline reading since 2016 with housing price growth slowing to 8-year lows. Housing is likely to be a massive drag on the UK going forward as the country is highly leveraged to its housing stock which will suffer further declines should UK spin out of EU with a hard Brexit.\n\nAt very minimum, the lower price levels should keep the BoE on sidelines for a considerable amount of time irrespective of the political resolution of Brexit.

The consensus view is for a and anything outside of that level will be a major surprise to the market, especially if the Fed cuts by 50bps which would suggest that liquidity problems in the US banking system are worse than initially thought.\n\nThis week\u2019s turbulence in the repo market which saw rates spike to highs not seen since the global financial crisis is just the type of distraction that Chairman Powell did not need. Much of the tightness has been attributed to technical factors but given the skittish behavior of the fixed income markets, any attempt by the Fed to overcompensate on the accommodative side will be seen as a worrying sign that US policymakers are concerned about the US economy despite seemingly robust data.\n\nGiven Chairman Powell\u2019s hawkish slant it\u2019s unlikely that he will assume a deeply accommodative posture and that should keep the dollar bid unless the equity markets commence a sharp selloff in which case risk aversion flows could reverse any knee jerk bounce. Regardless of the outcome, given the great anticipation ahead of the event today\u2019s presser could prove to be volatile as traders navigate the many crosscurrents that are driving capital markets currently.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Boris Schlossberg covering: US Dollar Index Futures.
