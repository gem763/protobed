But we know one thing for sure: Brexit is a \u00adcomplete disaster that poses a huge risk to our country.\n\nThe October 31 deadline is just a few short weeks away. Yet Boris Johnson is still saying he would take us off the cliff edge with a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThis would be a catastrophe.\n\nWe often hear government ministers talking about how a no-deal Brexit would only lead to \u201cbumps in the road\u201d or \u201cshort-term pain\u201d.\n\nBut they should remember that they\u2019re talking about real people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.\n\nThose who would be hit the hardest by Brexit, particularly a no-deal Brexit, are not the politicians who are \u00adpromoting it at all costs from the luxury of the television studios.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt would be the poorest in our society, the communities already suffering from austerity. And those who have been ignored and left behind for years.\n\nThe truth is Boris Johnson has had months to sort out this mess but has chosen instead to spend most of the time running down the clock.\n\nIt now seems unlikely there will be any kind of deal. And even if there is, it\u2019ll be a very bad one.\n\nUnsurprisingly Boris Johnson is \u00adtrying to blame everyone but himself. It\u2019s the judges\u2019 fault. It\u2019s the media\u2019s fault. It\u2019s Europe\u2019s fault. And \u2013 of course \u2013 Parliament is to blame.\n\nThe public won\u2019t be fooled that \u00adeasily. Because it\u2019s clear that party politics and the personal ambitions of one man, Boris Johnson, have \u00adrepeatedly been put ahead of the national interest.\n\nEnough is enough. It\u2019s time to take Brexit out of the hands of this Government and put it back to the British public.\n\nWhat we\u2019re being offered now is a million miles away from what was promised in 2016.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nNo one voted for a bad deal or no deal at all. No one voted for the leader of their country to ride roughshod over the law and show such blatant disregard for our democracy. And no one voted to see their prime minister pit Parliament against the people.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s only right that we give the final say back to the public.\n\nCrucially, when the public does \u00adfinally get another say, politicians from all parties must be honest this time. They must tell the truth about what\u2019s really in the best interests of our \u00adcountry and for future generations to come. That is unquestionably to remain in the European Union.\n\nThat\u2019s why, whatever happens, I\u2019ll be campaigning night and day for the UK to remain in the EU.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be urging everyone \u2013 \u00adincluding the whole of the Labour party \u2013 to do the same.", "description": "As the deadline looms, it's time for a second referendum to poll-axe Brexit and prevent disaster for the UK", "authors": ["Sadiq Khan", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565624.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Cartoon_7716JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
