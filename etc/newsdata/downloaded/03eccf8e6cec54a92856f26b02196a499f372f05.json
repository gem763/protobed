Even if you hate Trump", "language": "en", "text": "If the U.S. economy enters a recession during the next 12 months, it could doom President Trump\u2019s reelection odds. Some Democrats probably hope that happens.\n\nBut nobody should hope for a recession. For starters, voters are wise to economic doomsayers trying to convince them everything is terrible. That is showing up now in conflicting data. GDP growth and hiring are slowing, and the manufacturing sector is contracting. Plus, short-term interest rates are now higher than long-term rates, a reliable warning of recession. The media is breathlessly reporting it all.\n\nYet consumers remain confident, with a measure of the \u201cpresent situation\u201d at the highest level since 2000. Workers see little evidence of layoffs or other dangers in their own lives, which means shoppers are spending freely. Consumer spending represents about 70% of the U.S. economy, so it\u2019s hard to have a recession if consumers are feeling good.\n\nConsumer sentiment can change quickly if things go wrong. But politicians trying to bum them out won\u2019t do the trick. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, constantly warns voters about a \u201ccrisis\u201d of one form or another, and she\u2019s been rising in polls among a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates. But she\u2019s still far behind front-runner Joe Biden, who\u2019s sunnier. In Morning Consult polls, Warren takes just 15% of the Democratic vote, fueling concerns about her electability in a general election where she\u2019d have to win pragmatic centrists wondering what crisis she\u2019s talking about.\n\n[Check our more episodes of our Ballots & Dollars podcast.]\n\nThere\u2019s also nothing recession-wishers can do to actually effectuate a downturn. You can\u2019t talk people into a bunker mentality, and no group of people can slow its spending habits enough to impact the gigantic US economy. It\u2019s folly to think otherwise.\n\nFinally, recessions are terrible and people suffer. Some dramatically. Safety-net programs help but don\u2019t leave everybody whole. In recent YouGov polling, 43% of Americans said they\u2019re prepared for a recession, while 44% said they\u2019re not. And 38% say they haven\u2019t fully recovered from the last recession, which ended 10 years ago.\n\nTrump is vulnerable on the economy without a recession. He said he\u2019d boost annual growth to at least 3% and possibly 4%, through tax cuts and deregulation. But the best he got last year was 2.9%, with GDP on track for about 2% growth this year.\n\nThe sharp cut in the corporate tax rate was supposed to trigger a business-spending boom that trickled down to workers. In 2017, the Trump White House said the average family would see a $4,000 income boost within 3 to 5 years. Nothing like that is happening. And now, business spending is falling, after a modest bump last year, as the following chart shows. There were two bigger bumps in business spending under President Obama.\n\nSource: St. Louis Federal Reserve, Bureau of Economic Analysis More\n\n\n\nPrices for hundreds of consumer goods will rise this fall, thanks to Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Trump still has time to pull a rabbit out of a hat and ink some kind of deal with China that allows him to pull back the tariffs. But as the election draws closer, Trump\u2019s hand weakens and China\u2019s gets stronger. Trump foolishly proclaimed, of course, that trade wars are \u201cgood, and easy to win,\u201d setting himself up for mockery by political foes pointing to Trump\u2019s tax hikes on ordinary shoppers. No recession required.\n\nTrump\u2019s Democratic opponents seem to worry that he has a hex on voters, backed by Vladimir Putin\u2019s deft ability to manipulate elections from afar. But the biggest hex on voters may be Democrats unable to capitalize on Trump\u2019s many failures. Then again, maybe they might.\n\nAll Markets Summit 2019 More\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman", "description": "Voters are wise to doomsaying politicians trying to make them think everything is terrible.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/iRlAt3ChqzR4GnhTAnwiPA--~B/aD01OTQ7dz0xMTYxO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/453a12a0-ca7c-11e9-9fcd-400ace353fb3", "published_at": "2019-08-29"}
