At that stage the property was only 80 per cent finished.\n\nThat was when Perth civil engineer Riccardo Rizzi snapped up the property and vowed to stay true to the dreams of Ms Marks and her husband in creating the highest quality property.\n\nMr Rizzi ensured everyone hired to work on the house had been paid and rehired most of the contractors.\n\nThe six-bedroom mansion now sprawls over five blocks after Mr Rizzi bought the property next door for $1.2 million, and was completed with a no-expense-spared approach.\n\nIt has been a labour of love for Mr Rizzi, who said he did not keep track of the costs.\n\n\u201cI can say it cost considerably more than I originally estimated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn opportunity comes up once in a lifetime to do something like this \u2026 it\u2019s been an absolutely, thoroughly enjoyable process.\u201d\n\nMr Rizzi is selling as the house is too big for him alone, with his four children all in Western Australia. He has lived in it while work has continued to complete it.\n\n\u201cMy children have all returned to Perth and I felt that after being there for six years it was time to be close to the children,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ostentatious offering features artesian windows worth up to $40,000 each, a 30m pool, 106m of waterfrontage, a roman-inspired garden and a 4m high, 1500kg statue of Neptune from Florence.\n\nIt can be sold with the furniture, which was styled by MJ Elegant Interiors.\n\nAlex Phillis of self-titled agency is marketing the property, which he said was in a league of its own with nothing else like it in the southern hemisphere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on one of the best positions in Australia and is one of the biggest volume houses in Australia \u2014 it\u2019s the size of a luxury boutique hotel,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe think the buyer will probably come from overseas, the fact the house hasn\u2019t been registered here, it is still available for foreign buyers to buy without having an Australian visa.\n\n\u201cWe are reaching out worldwide.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t rule out the local market as well, there are certainly enough big hitters in Australia and New Zealand to buy the house, but naturally you think Asia, Middle East and parts of Europe.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s taken years and millions of dollars to complete, but a notorious mansion has finally been finished and is up for grabs with an eye-watering $45 million price tag.", "authors": ["Mikaela Day"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/04071228/capi_6562149d2fda92a71621486d1267092f_6387a0cc0830c24947ef799c8291d424.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
