The film, about a mythological Indian queen, provoked anger among Hindu hardliners, who claimed it misrepresented its central figure, Queen Padmavati.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alia Bhatt, the best actress winner, poses at the awards.

The film\u2019s release was delayed but went ahead in 2018 under heavy security after India\u2019s censors suggested a name change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle and a blessing I made it as an actor. To do what I love to do for a living is a gift,\u201d said Singh, who praised Padukone, his wife and co-star.\n\nThe subject matter of Raazi, which tells the story of a Kashmiri spy who is married by her father to a Pakistani official, has also proved sensitive. In August, India announced it would revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status, a move that has faced major resistance and infuriated Pakistan.\n\nBollywood films have been banned from Pakistani cinemas since February, when a suicide bomb attack on Indian soldiers brought the two countries to the brink of war. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, reiterated the ban on cultural exchanges in August. Indian adverts, soap operas and films are also banned from local TV in Pakistan.\n\nThe IIFA awards, which have previously been held in London, Toronto, Singapore and Bangkok, followed a bumper year for Bollywood. Nearly 1,800 titles were released last year, making the Indian film industry the biggest in the world in terms of the number of films made.\n\nBollywood stars Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif, Sara Ali Khan and Madhuri Dixit were among those who performed at the ceremony.\n\nThe Bollywood industry grew by 12.2% in 2018, including not only Hindi-language movies but also titles in regional languages such as Tamil and Telugu, according to a report released in March by Ernst & Young and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.\n\nWhile Bollywood is hugely popular among the south Asian diaspora in North America, Britain and the Gulf region, it has also developed new audiences in China, which was the largest international market for Indian content in 2018. Last year, 10 Indian films were released in China.\n\nThe black comedy Andhadhun, for which Sriram Raghavan won best director, grossed almost $50m (\u00a340m) in China. The film also won best screenplay and best story at the awards.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this report", "description": "Controversial Padmaavat film also triumphs as Indian \u2018Oscars\u2019 held in country for first time", "authors": ["Rebecca Ratcliffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b0030d8611ef0a9e900acd15d2762fb4bfc089c/59_274_3153_1891/master/3153.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0ea5d95fe4886cdfc836406add4fa35", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
