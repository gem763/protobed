Gavin Newsom: 'Completely corrupt' Trump should be removed from office", "language": "en", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom has all the evidence to believe \u201ccompletely corrupt\u201d President Donald Trump should be removed from office by Congress, but with Republicans in control of the U.S. Senate he says the best way to boot Trump from the White House is at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t support impeachment unless I supported removal,\u201d Newsom told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday, marking the first time he has explicitly stated senators should vote Trump out of office.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, has long backed impeachment proceedings, calling for hearings as early as 2017 while seeking his first term as governor and the Russia investigation was consuming Washington.\n\nStill, he doesn\u2019t think removal is likely to happen. The Republican-controlled chamber \u201cwill simply do nothing but abdicate any traditional oversight of bad behavior of this administration,\u201d he said. He thinks voters, though, will choose a Democrat over Trump next fall.\n\nDuring the AP interview, Newsom discussed California\u2019s ongoing battles with the Trump administration and the faltering presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who Newsom endorsed. Harris and Newsom cut their political teeth in San Francisco, she as district attorney and he as a supervisor and then mayor.\n\nHarris launched her presidential campaign in January amid much fanfare and got a bump in the polls after challenging Joe Biden in the first Democratic debate, but she\u2019s since seen her standing in national and California polls fall. Newsom said Harris, who was elected in 2016, was at a disadvantage when she entered the race. She had little name recognition, he said, while former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren already were established on the national political stage.\n\n\u201cThe fact she\u2019s still a top-tier candidate is in and of itself pretty extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we set really high expectations \u2026 but I think she\u2019s now about where if she started this campaign without that expectation of those first few weeks, she\u2019d be probably pretty satisfied because she\u2019s in the mix.\u201d\n\nNewsom is headlining a fundraiser for Harris later this month in Los Angeles with Hollywood powerbrokers such as Universal chairwoman Donna Langely and producer J.J. Abrams. Harris raised $11.6 million in the fundraising quarter that just ended, falling short of Biden, Warren, Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nNewsom has made no secret of his disdain for Trump and his policies. California has filed roughly 60 lawsuits against administration policies on environment, immigration and other issues. Newsom has accused Trump of threatening aid to California as a form of political retribution and has not been shy in his criticism.\n\nHe doubled down on Tuesday, calling Trump a \u201cpunch drunk,\u201d \u201dflailing\u201d president before suggesting impeachment proceedings may sharpen the focus of a chaotic Washington.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has called California a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and pointed to the state\u2019s homelessness as evidence of failed Democratic rule. His administration has moved to revoke California\u2019s ability to set its own auto emissions standards.\n\n\u201cIn some ways it\u2019s a calming force,\u201d Newsom said of impeachment, noting Trump knows how to change the narrative. With \u201ceveryone running to the daily, shiny object, at least we are now within a box frame,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nNewsom did not specify whether Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate Biden is what sparked his belief that Trump should be removed from office or whether he thought there was enough evidence to remove him prior to that.\n\nHis spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "California Gov.
