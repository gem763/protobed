That's for me to know and no-one to find out. The thing is, if I say something they'll go digging for it,\" she ranted.\n\n\"Hopefully it'll come out in its own time.\"\n\nShe then begged magazines to get in touch with her to arrange holiday photoshoots and cash in exchange for nuggets of information.\n\n\"If you want to know the truth, get in touch and I'll do a Q&A, I'll do a glossy photoshoot, whoever comes up with the most money - it's all about the Pricey Pricey money,\" she went on.\n\n(Image: Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images)\n\n\"Who knows, if there's a man, you might get a photoshoot with him - if there's a man.\n\n\"Or take me away somewhere nice so I can wear a bikini, I can do a nice glossy photoshoot to reveal all.\"\n\nThe former glamour model managed to get to the radio show on time, which Rick joked he was surprised about.\n\nKatie revealed she could have joined him in Ibiza earlier this summer, but turned down the trip because she was worried about press stories about her partying ways.\n\n\"You were trying to make me come out, I was being good and refusing to party,\" she confessed.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"I thought if the media got hold of it it wasn't worth the story as I was trying to keep my head down.\"\n\nAs Rick played her track Hurricane, Katie joked: \"Do you know what, there's going to be a hurricane. She's on form today, the Pricey. This a live PA then.\"\n\nKatie is currently filming for the next series of her reality TV show Katie Price : My Crazy Life, which will go on until July next year.\n\nBut she told Rick that they still had to finish off her music album before her schedule got too hectic.\n\n\"I might change my name by deed poll to Drama Price, because my friends say there's always drama,\" she groaned.\n\n(Image: charlesdrury1/Instagram)\n\nAnd Katie hinted she's still struggling privately after her year from hell, which saw her split from third husband Kieran Hayler, dabble with cocaine and have a stint at rehab to treat her PTSD.\n\n\"If only you could hear the conversations me and Rick were just having,\" she told listeners after a break.\n\n\"I was shocked to the core. I don't know how you're keeping it together. I feel like breaking down for you,\" Rick said.\n\n\"After what I just told you, how could anyone go on?\" said Katie cryptically.\n\nKatie also took aim at the press again, insisting nobody except her family and friends know the real her.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"Believe me, I do hold back or there could be trouble. I'm like a chameleon, that's what I do, I can change - if you're at a posh event you change, if you're with kids you change. I adapt,\" she said.\n\n\"No management, no PR ever tell me what to do, that's why I always look discombobulated in the media.\n\n\"And they don't even know me. I have patience - why give them what they want? When people meet me they say, 'you're nothing like how you are in the media'. I am bonkers and nuts. There used to be a game with the media and sometimes I think I should engage with them, then they'd get the fun, bubbly side of me.\n\n\"It's fun doing photoshoots with all the magazines, I miss that but all the time they're slagging me off, why should I do a shoot with you? I've got dignity like that.\"\n\n(Image: You Tube / Katie Price)\n\nShe also opened up about \"first love\" Dane Bowers, revealing she's meeting him tonight at the Bad Boys On The Block gig.\n\n\"Me and Dane, I always talk to Dane anyway. I have known him since I was 18. He's been to my house parties, he's like my friend now,\" she insisted.\n\n\"I'm 41, he must be 39, 40 now - Jesus. There's nothing there like that. He was my first love and at 40 years we're friends.\"\n\nKatie Price appeared on Flex 101.4FM", "description": "Katie Price wouldn't be drawn on her rocky love life and insisted she should be getting paid for selling stories about herself", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Instagram", "Tim P.
