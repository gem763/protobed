Before that, he served as the chief operating officer, head of markets and deputy head of wholesale banking. Nordea has begun the search for his successor.\n\nThe Nordics\u2019 biggest lender said Sept. 5 its new chief executive would be Mr. Vang-Jensen. Last week, Nordea said Torsten Hagen J\u00f8rgensen, the bank\u2019s deputy CEO and group chief operating officer, and Karen Tobiasen, its head of its human resources department, also would be leaving the bank.\n\nFrank Vang-Jensen, Nordea Bank\u2019s new chief executive, in 2016.

The bank during the first quarter took a \u20ac95 million ($104.7 million) provision for a potential fine.\n\nOther European banks that have faced recent compliance and anti- money-laundering issues also have made changes to their top management teams in recent months. Danske Bank A/S this month hired a new finance chief. The appointment came after Danske\u2019s new CEO began in the job in June.\n\nSwedbank AB also recruited a new CEO at the end of August, and ING Groep NV announced a new finance chief in December.\n\nNordea has struggled with falling revenue for several quarters in a row. Mr. Vang-Jensen has said Nordea needs to focus on cost cutting and revenue creation.\n\nThe bank declined to provide additional insights into the type of candidate it would be seeking for its next CFO. But whoever fills the role will play a key role in accomplishing those efficiency and revenue goals, analysts said.\n\nThe bank, which relocated from Sweden to Finland in 2018, has pledged to reduce costs through 2021.\n\nThis year, Nordea\u2019s costs are set to be lower than the \u20ac4.74 billion in costs recorded in 2018. In 2021, the bank wants expenses to be 3% lower than they were in 2018, executives have said.\n\nNordea announced 6,000 job cuts in 2017, but more reductions might be necessary, according to Antti Saari, the head of research at OP Corporate Bank PLC. The bank employed 29,550 people at the end of the second quarter, according to an earnings release.\n\nHigher amounts invested in compliance were one of several factors, including expectations of lower interest rates, that led Nordea in July to announce plans to review its financial targets and dividend policy.\n\nAlthough the bank has invested heavily in improving its anti-money-laundering controls in recent years, those costs have begun to stabilize, former Nordea CEO Casper von Koskull said during a July earnings call. The company is now exploring ways to improve efficiency, including by investing in more automation.\n\nMr. Vang-Jensen is expected to provide new guidelines on the bank\u2019s dividend and other financial items later this year, according to analysts.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com and Kristin Broughton at Kristin.Broughton@wsj.com", "description": "The Helsinki-based lender said Christopher Rees, the group chief financial officer and head of group finance and treasury, is departing from the bank in 2020 and plans to relocate to the U.K. to pursue new opportunities, Nordea said.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Kristin Broughton", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com", "Kristin.Broughton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108413/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
