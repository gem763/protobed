Clyde Edwards-Helaire led the way with 134 rushing yards and two scores, part of a 218-yard night for the Tigers on the ground.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS:Highs and lows from Week 7 in college football\n\nSOONERS SHINE:No. 5 Oklahoma with stingy defense prove too much for Texas\n\nSEC SHOCKER:South Carolina knocks off No. 3 Georgia in two overtimes\n\nThe first half was thrilling, with Florida answering an LSU touchdown with a score of its own three separate times. Van Jefferson sent the game into halftime tied at 21 with a touchdown grab with four seconds remaining.\n\nThat throw gave Trask his second touchdown of the game. He had 141 yards in the first half. Counterpart Burrow was lights-out early, hitting the intermission 10-for-11 passing for 121 yards and two scores.\n\nBoth teams had over 100 rushing yards at the break and over 245 yards overall.\n\nFlorida came out after halftime and marched down the field to take its first lead, 28-21 on another Jefferson catch. LSU immediately responded with a drive of its own to knot the game again at 28.\n\nLSU was then finally able to force its first stop since it was 7-7, and turned the good field position back into the lead on Tyrion Davis-Price's 33-yard scamper.\n\nTrask finished with 310 passing yards on 39 attempts and had three TDs, but his interception was too much to overcome.", "description": "Joe Burrow again had a big day, throwing for three touchdowns, as No. 6 LSU beat No. 7 Florida in matchup of SEC unbeatens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/13/USAT/d6b7cf94-a188-4f2a-a60c-388dcb3e3731-USATSI_13507104.jpg?crop=2609,1468,x0,y81&width=2098&height=1468&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
