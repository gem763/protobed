Of these 57 needed to be relocated from Johannesburg to Durban, and a similar number were due to be moved from Durban to Johannesburg.\n\nA far smaller number of cars were available to be picked up in Margate, Newcastle, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, East London, and Richards Bay.\n\nTransfercar is testing the concept with a major rental car company it did not want to name. If it proves viable in South Africa, the company hopes to facilitate a few thousand rentals per year, Transfercar chief marketing officer Pascal Languillon said in an interview.\n\n\"Two thousand, three thousand or four thousand a year. It\u2019s in that range.\u201d\n\nSince the launch in August, \u201ca few dozen\u201d trips have been booked in South Africa via the Transfercar website, Languillon says.\n\nCheaper than trucks \u2013 but no free petrol for now\n\nRental cars are usually moved by truck, after being loaded onto a specialised trailer, or by professional drivers at great expense, Languillon says.\n\nTo avoid such costs some of the rental companies offer free petrol or even free toll fees during the relocation period, Languillon says, and even then they are paying between a quarter and a fifth of what they would otherwise.\n\nFor now, at least, free petrol is not on offer in SA.\n\nVolunteer drivers who want to use a vehicle for more than the single day \u2013 during the period when the rental company wants it relocated \u2013 can rent it for longer at something close to normal rates. The most expensive daily rental for a vehicle on Transfercar\u2019s local website is R1,204 per additional day for VW Tiguan, while the cheapest vehicle currently is a VW Polo Vivo, which is priced at R325 per day.\n\nMost of the cars that are up for relocation on the Transfercar South African website are sport utility vehicles.\n\n\u201cThat is because of the current requirement of the rental company. In the future we hope to have camper vans,\u201d Languillon says.\n\nTransfercar makes its money from the fee it charges the rental companies for each vehicle relocation.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Transfercar is in a testing period in South Africa, but hopes to help rental companies move thousands of cars a year \u2013 while the drivers get to \"rent\" cars for free.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9520/a38488f7db4c4d72b3ecc3ae6d2b8baf.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
