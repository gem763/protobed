REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\n\nLeveraged funds have increased their net short positions on the euro, expecting the ECB to cut interest rates, announce it will buy government bonds or other European assets, or both.\n\nOther global central banks are already loosening monetary policy, including the People\u2019s Bank of China which on Friday cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves.\n\n\u201cECB watchers are confident there could be a 20 bps cut and so the potential surprise (for the euro) on the rate cut isn\u2019t that big,\u201d said Esther Maria Reichelt, a Commerzbank analyst.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s far more difficult to assess what kind of unconventional measures\u201d the ECB could use to stimulate the euro zone economy, which \u201ccould have a far bigger impact on the euro,\u201d Reichelt said.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in a 72% chance the ECB will cut rates by 20 basis points on Thursday, a slightly lower level of certainty than last week. Some analysts suggest the ECB will start buying euro zone equities, not just government bonds, in a new wave of quantitative easing.\n\nBy 1040 GMT, the euro was steady against the dollar at $1.10335. It slipped to $1.10155 overnight, its weakest since Sept. 4. EUR=EBS\n\nHedge funds have added more short euro positions, taking the amount of contracts to $6.74 billion in the week to Sept. 3, the highest in a month, though positions were not as big as in April. EURNETUSD=\n\n(Graphic: Hedge funds' latest net short positions on the euro, here)\n\n(Graphic: CFTC weekly data, here)\n\n\u201cThe default is to be negative euro into ECB,\u201d said Kenneth Broux, head of corporate research at Societe Generale.\n\n\u201cResuming bond purchases won\u2019t do anything\u201d to the euro zone economy because \u201cthe monetary policy in Europe has stopped being effective,\u201d Broux said. \u201cThe ECB has done all it can.\u201d\n\nThe dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six other currencies .DXY, was flat at 98.33. The dollar was also confined to a narrow range against the yen as traders weighed the prospect of U.S. rate cuts against their demand for safe-haven assets. Dollar/yen was last up 0.1% at 107.02 JPY=EBS.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to sustain the U.S. economic expansion, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday in Zurich, bolstering expectations for a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting on Sept. 18.\n\nElsewhere, sterling turned positive to reach a six-week high of $1.2385 GBP=D3 after better-than-expected British economic data and because some banks have revised down their no-deal Brexit expectations.\n\nTraders waited to see whether the British parliament would vote to hold an early general election before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. If a snap election were held and the Conservative Party won, it could scrap recent legislation to extend Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union for a third time.\n\nAgainst the euro, sterling was up 0.6% at 89.17, having hit earlier a six-week high of 90.13.
