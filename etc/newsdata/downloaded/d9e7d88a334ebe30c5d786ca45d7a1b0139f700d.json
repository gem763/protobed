P. Michael McKinley resigned from his post just last week after a career that spanned decades and included posts as U.S. ambassador to Brazil and Afghanistan. The Washington Post reported that his resignation came amid low morale within the State Department and worries that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was not supporting those wrapped up in the controversy over Ukraine, allegations Pompeo has denied. McKinley's testimony Wednesday will come after a busy day Tuesday that included Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, ignoring a subpoena and refusing to turn over documents related to the inquiry. Also, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly rejected calls by Trump and his GOP allies to hold a full vote on whether to authorize the inquiry. The impeachment probe is looking at whether Trump abused his office for his own political gain and whether he used military aid to pressure Ukraine to gather dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nCLOSE Trump and impeachment: Can President Trump block witnesses and subpoenas, and what can Congress do about it? Lawyer and author David Stewart explains. Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\nPence, Pompeo head to Turkey, hope to get ceasefire deal\n\nVice President Mike Pence will travel to Turkey Wednesday to try to reach a ceasefire deal, according to President Donald Trump. Pence will lead a delegation that will include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and they will meet Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey pressed on with its incursions into Syria on Tuesday despite the Trump administration's demands for a ceasefire and the United States' imposition of economic sanctions and a threat to punish Turkish officials. The crisis began last week when Erdogan told Trump he planned to invade Syria and Trump announced the withdrawal of a small contingent of U.S. troops stationed on the Syria-Turkey border. Trump's decision sparked a bipartisan backlash and international outrage, largely because it seemed to give Erdogan a green light to attack the Kurdish fighters that have been key U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State terrorists.\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump says Vice President Mike Pence will be traveling to Turkey on Wednesday to try to reach a ceasefire deal. (Oct. 15) AP, AP\n\nSome Democrats head back on the campaign trail after Tuesday's debate\n\nThere is no rest for the weary for four of the Democratic presidential candidates who were at the party's debate in the key battleground state of Ohio Tuesday. Former Vice President Joe Biden; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris will all attend campaign events in Iowa on Wednesday. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar will start a two-day swing in New Hampshire before making her own trip to Iowa this weekend. Looking back at the fourth Democratic debate, the stage hosted a record 12 candidates battling it out over a series of key issues, including, for the first time, the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Another notable development saw the focus of shots and attacks shifting away from Biden and more to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, which is surely in response to her mounting support in recent national polls.\n\nCLOSE Twelve Democratic presidential contenders debated in Ohio, the first debate since the launch of the impeachment inquiry in President Trump.

It will be James' first appearance in front of the home crowd since he said Morey \"wasn't educated on the situation at hand\" when he tweeted out support for Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters. Morey's tweet and the NBA's subsequent support of Morey set off a firestorm that has caused tension between the league and China, a nation that has made the NBA billions of dollars.\n\nCLOSE Basketball player Lebron James' standing among basketball fans in Hong Kong took a hit because of comments the NBA star made about free speech.
