Key participants in the plan acknowledge significant risks, though, with citrus greening still sickening trees throughout the state.\n\nAt stake is a segment of an industry that has a $10 billion-plus economic impact in Florida, with some 60,000 jobs, according to Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\n\nGrowers are using new strategies to combat citrus greening, which is spread by the pin-sized psyllid insect. Canker also took its toll on Florida\u2019s citrus groves before citrus greening \u2014 but greening is by far the biggest threat now.\n\nOrange and grapefruit groves are trying new varieties that have shown resistance to greening. Screens are being used to cover new trees and keep the bugs out. New fertilizer techniques help the trees survive longer, too. But the uncertainty of success in planting so many new trees is high.\n\nRisky plan\n\n\u201cYes there is risk. We don\u2019t have our heads in the sand,\u201d said Dan Richey, of the Scott Family citrus companies based in Vero Beach. It is the biggest investor in the project, estimated to cost $25 million once all 1,500 acres are planted.\n\nThat company has partnered with Peace River Citrus, also based in Vero Beach, and Coca-Cola has agreed to buy juice from the venture. Japan-based Takasago International is paying $1.5 million to cover the cost of the trees and is guaranteeing purchase of grapefruit peel oil for flavors and fragrance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where if we don\u2019t recreate the industry from the ground up, the infrastructure collapses \u2014 and we don\u2019t want that,\u201d Richey said.\n\nCoca-Cola is supporting the new grapefruit planting by committing to buy juice for its brands, such as Minute Maid, for 20 years at a minimum price. The drink manufacturer also backed a large orange tree planting in Florida starting in 2013 \u2014 a $2 billion project spread over 25,000 acres.\n\nFlorida has been the nation\u2019s leader in citrus production since the 1800s, but that level had dropped closer to that of California in recent years. Florida has a well-developed network of groves, packers, processors and rail lines that connecting them. That network is collapsing, though, because growers have faced increasing hardships in recent years.\n\nFor example, even though citrus canker had been found in the state since 1910, previous outbreaks of that disease were successfully eradicated just by chopping down infected trees. But hurricanes in 2004 spread the disease to more than 25 counties, and in 2005, the state gave up trying to chop down infected trees.\n\nSince then, growers have had to live with the disease by managing it with chemicals and best growing practices.\n\nGreening a big threat\n\nThe newer and more dire threat of citrus greening was first discovered in groves around 2005, according the University of Florida. That\u2019s when steep losses in state citrus production really began. Farmers who had struggled to hold on during the canker wars then had to deal with a double whammy.\n\nCitrus acres in Florida dropped to 402,000 in 2018 from 679,000 in 2004, while the number of growers plummeted to 2,775 in 2017 from 7,389 in 2002, according to University of Florida assistant professor Ariel Singerman. Hurricane Irma in 2017 also damaged thousands of acres of orange and grapefruit trees.\n\nForty-one 41 juice processing plants operated in 2004, but only 14 were running in 2017. And Florida Citrus Mutual, the industry\u2019s advocacy group, said last month that only seven major citrus processing plants remain open. There once were 80 packing houses, but that dropped to 26 in 2017.\n\nCitrus production hit a record high of 244 million boxes in the late 1990s. But citrus greening and Hurricane Irma reduced that to just over 45 million boxes during the 2017-18 crop year. Last year\u2019s crop recovered a little, but still was one-fourth of the record high.\n\nCitrus canker and citrus greening are both native to Asia, which is where citrus originated, as well, said Jim Graham, emeritus professor of soil microbiology at University of Florida. He said Florida escaped those diseases in the first decades after citrus became widespread around the turn of the century.\n\n\u201cGrapefruit in general is particularly vulnerable to citrus greening. It usually doesn\u2019t even make it to the fruiting stage,\u201d Graham said. For that reason, success with a new grapefruit planting could signal a turning point in the war against citrus disease.\n\nStar Ruby chosen\n\nThe grapefruit project led by the Scott family will attempt to plant a different type of grapefruit, the Star Ruby, which was developed at Texas A&I University and made available to the public in 1977. It is popular in California.\n\nPreviously, in the Vero Beach area, almost all grapefruit were Ruby Red \u2014 which succumbed quickly to citrus greening.\n\nGraham said the Star Ruby is a better bet than Ruby Red.\n\n\u201cStar Ruby trees are showing better conditions. I\u2019ve seen that myself. But we don\u2019t know whether that variety will show less susceptibility in new plantings,\u201d Graham said.\n\nIn general, the state advises growers to try new varieties on a small scale for a few years to see how they hold up. But growers feel an urgency to preserve the infrastructure and workforce, Richey said.\n\n\u201cThe approach is a collaborative effort to mitigate the risk. It\u2019s a big project, but at this point, you can\u2019t be half pregnant \u2014 either we go big or we see the industry collapse,\u201d he said.", "description": "ORLANDO, Fla., Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 Florida grapefruit growers are trying to help preserve the industry with new plantings, taking a bold step in the face", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
