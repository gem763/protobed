Passengers, outfitted in specially designed spacesuits by Under Armour, will hurtle in a rocket-powered space plane to more than 50 miles into the atmosphere. At the peak of the flight, customers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness and can peer out the plane's windows at Earth's curved horizon and the blackness of outer space.\n\nThe startup has notched successful demonstration flights of its rocket-powered space plane called SpaceShipTwo. Test flights in December and February closely mimicked the flight path its commercial missions will take. The plane is designed to carry two pilots and up to six passengers.\n\nBranson is expected to be among the first passengers aboard a SpaceShipTwo flight.", "description": "Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic on Monday is set to become the first publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company.", "authors": ["Victoria Cavaliere", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190709094139-01-virgin-galactic-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
