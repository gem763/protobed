South Korean exports in the first 20 days of October, a leading indicator for intra-Asian trade and for the tech cycle, dropped almost 20%, extending their decline to 10 months.\n\nFactory prices dropped faster than in September, according to Bloomberg\u2019s producer price tracker, which was at the lowest since mid-2016. The tracker is a leading indicator for the official price data, which is due early next month, and shows that there will be no immediate improvement to the price declines which hurt both company profits and their ability to repay debt.\n\nSolid signs of stabilization remain elusive. Sales managers were the most confident they\u2019ve been in 19 months, though sub-indices including market growth and staffing indicate still-weak activity, according to World Economics, which compiles the data. Data for small and medium-sized companies did show signs of improvement in October, according to Standard Chartered (LON: ) Plc.\n\n\u201cSub-indices for \u2018current performance,\u2019 \u2018expectations,\u2019 and \u2018credit conditions\u2019 rose during the month, increasing the likelihood of a tepid recovery in the fourth quarter on continued counter-cyclical policy measures,\u201d Economists Lan Shen and Ding Shuang from Standard Chartered (LON: ) wrote in a note. \u201cDomestic demand recovered slightly, driven largely by a strong performance in the construction and manufacturing sectors,\u201d although external trade remains a major headwind, they wrote.\n\nStock prices also rebounded in the month, with a strong recovery in real-estate stocks, on the back of resurgent investment into the property sector. Iron ore prices dropped as supply increased.\n\n\u201cHigher tariffs and trade war uncertainties may continue to hurt corporate earnings and manufacturing sector investment,\u201d UBS Economist Tao Wang wrote in a recent note. \u201cWe expect policy support to strengthen in 2020 but with less monetary easing. We see more financing for infrastructure investment, support for SMEs and social safety net, and further structural reforms and opening up of the domestic market.\u201d\n\nNote on Early Indicators construction\n\nBloomberg Economics generates the overall activity reading by aggregating the three-month weighted average of the monthly changes of eight indicators, which are based on business surveys or market prices.", "description": "China\u2019s Slowdown Rolls On Into October, Early Indicators Show", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic24bbafced0a67954bed83ac3bd5c08e4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
