Scientists discovered that when they first cut open the whale\u2019s head, a milky substance known as spermaceti \u2013 sperm oil \u2013 seeped out. After the finding, they were officially named sperm whales and it is thought this substance controls buoyancy and echo location. The animals, which have the largest brain of any known sea or land creature, have been hunted mercilessly by whalers for spermaceti. It is a highly sought out substance as it has been used in lubricants, candles and oil lamps. Now sperm whales are classed as vulnerable, with around 200,000 thought to be alive today. The male ones can grow up to 60ft and typically live for around 70 years. They can dive to depths of up to 1.2 miles, with underwater hunts typically lasting around 30 minutes before they need air. The highest sound pressure level ever recorded from an animal was from a sperm whale off the coast of Norway, with a sound so powerful it can stun and even kill prey. Experts have regularly found marks on their bodies from tussles with squids and the whales have even been known to kill various species of shark.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
