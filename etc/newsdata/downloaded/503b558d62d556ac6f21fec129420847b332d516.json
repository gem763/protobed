The steep drop indicates US exporters have also suffered from the trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\n\"The Sino-US trade spat is behind these softer figures,\" Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst for Markets.com, said in a note on Monday. \"Trade data won't go anywhere but south as the second half of the year plays out and China feels the impact of the latest rounds of tariffs.\"\n\nFurther escalation of the trade war looks likely, Wilson added. More tit-for-tat tariffs could accelerate China's declines in the coming months.\n\nThe Trump administration slapped 15% duties on $112 billion worth of Chinese goods on September 1. If a trade agreement isn't reached, the US plans to hike existing tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% at the start of October and impose duties on another $160 billion worth of imports in mid-December.\n\nChina has targeted about $120 billion worth of US goods so far. It retaliated with new tariffs at the start of September and has a second batch planned for mid-December. Chinese officials are set to attend trade talks in Washington next month in the hope of striking a deal and avoiding those increases.\n\nChina's overall exports slid 0.1% in August, upending analysts' expectations of 2.2% growth, Bloomberg said. The surprise downturn could ramp up pressure on Chinese authorities to stimulate the economy. On Friday, the central bank said it would cut banks' reserve requirements \u2014 the amount of cash they have to keep on hand \u2014 to its lowest level since 2007 in a bid to boost demand.", "description": "China's exports to the US tanked 16% in August as President Donald Trump's tariffs sapped demand for Chinese goods in their biggest foreign market.
