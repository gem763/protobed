And they\u2019re praised for it, and the women are looked down upon for it. But I feel like it\u2019s good [to do] because once you realize you\u2019re confident and good at it, then you\u2019re even better at what you do.\"\n\nAstronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir\n\nU.S. astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir stepped outside of the International Space Station together on Oct. 18, marking the first all-female spacewalk in history.\n\nNASA\n\n\"There has been a long line of female scientists, explorers, engineers and astronauts and we have followed in their footsteps to get us where we are today,\" Meir told President Donald Trump from space.\n\nA presidential candidate\n\nOne year after a record-breaking number of women were elected to Congress, four women are in the top tier of candidates running for president of the United States in the 2020 Democratic primary.\n\nElizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Tulsi Gabbard and Marianne Williamson all remain in the race.\n\nNicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo transform into a candidate for Halloween, pair an outfit with a homemade \"I Voted\" sticker and carry a homemade campaign sign or some brochures with the platform on which you'd campaign.\n\nWorld Cup-winning US women's soccer team\n\nThe U.S. Women's National Team won their fourth World Cup title this summer and launched a national conversation as they fought for the same pay and treatment as the men's national team.\n\nFrancisco Seco/AP, FILE\n\nDress up as a Team USA player --like Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan or Carli Lloyd -- for Halloween by wearing a world champions shirt or soccer jersey (or a shirt calling for equal pay) and carrying a soccer ball and a homemade World Cup trophy.\n\nTrack star Allyson Felix\n\nOlympic sprinter Allyson Felix smashed a world record for total medals held by track star Usain Bolt, and she did it just 10 months after giving birth.\n\nFelix was part of Team USA's mixed-gender 4x400-meter relay team that won the gold at the World Championships earlier this month. The win gave Felix her 12th gold medal at the world championships, pushing her past Bolt's record for the most gold medals of any athlete at the track and field World Championships.\n\nPatrick Smith/Getty Images, FILE\n\nPut running shoes on your feet and 12 World Championship gold medals around your neck to dress as Felix this Halloween.\n\nJulia Child\n\nChild, a cookbook author and TV personality, broke new ground as a female chef in a male-dominated industry.\n\nBachrach/Getty Images\n\nBring her to life on Halloween by pairing a collared shirt with an apron and carrying kitchen utensils, or even a stick of butter. For true authenticity, craft a patch modeled after the one Child\u2019s husband designed for her.\n\nRosie the Riveter\n\nRosie the Riveter was a World War II-era symbol of working women across the country.\n\nReed Saxon/AP\n\nBecome her for Halloween by donning a red bandana, red socks and a blue collared shirt. To take the costume up a notch, create a handmade sign to carry that reads, \"We Can Do It!\"\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose loyal fans created the nickname \"The Notorious R.B.G.\" for her, continues to be a legendary figure for some women.\n\nGinsburg proved herself undeterred by health complications, telling NPR this summer, \"There was a senator, I think it was after my pancreatic cancer, who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months. That senator, whose name I have forgotten, is now himself dead, and I am very much alive.\"\n\nShannon Stapleton/Reuters\n\nAll it takes to transform into Ginsburg for Halloween is a black robe, a pair of glasses and a pair of bold earrings. A toy kitchen tool or hammer can be transformed into a gavel and Ginsburg's famous \"dissent collar\" can be created with some felt, glue and creativity.", "description": "A few simple supplies and some creativity are all that's needed.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/simone-biles-medals-ap-jt-191021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
