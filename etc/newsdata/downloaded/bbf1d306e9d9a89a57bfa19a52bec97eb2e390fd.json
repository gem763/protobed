Over the summer, the Federal Trade Commission imposed a $5 billion fine and oversight conditions on Facebook for privacy violations.\n\nThe Department of Justice is investigating the U.S.'s largest tech firms for allegedly monopolistic behavior. Roughly 20 years ago, a similar case threatened to destabilize Microsoft. WSJ explains.\n\nWhile the probes haven\u2019t focused directly on the platforms\u2019 relationships with news publishers, the media industry has seen its business model severely disrupted by tech giants, particularly in online advertising. Together, Facebook and Google controlled 60% of the U.S. digital advertising market last year, according to eMarketer.\n\nGoogle executives said the prospect of regulation didn\u2019t influence their effort to better promote original news, adding that technological advances had finally allowed the company to address a longstanding concern among publishers.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think lawmakers should regulate how tech companies share and feature news? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of identifying and precisely ranking original reporting has taken years to address and has proven extremely difficult,\u201d said Richard Gingras, Google\u2019s vice president for news. \u201cWhat has changed is that we now have a lot more technical capabilities than we had 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nFacebook has expressed a commitment to improving its partnerships with news outlets, particularly those that publish legitimate, high-quality reporting.\n\n\u201cWe understand the critical importance of rewarding publishers that put their resources into original reporting, which is why it\u2019s been one of our guiding principles for the news tab since we decided to develop the product earlier this year,\u201d said Campbell Brown, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global news partnerships. \u201cIt\u2019s important to get this right.\u201d\n\nThe outlets Facebook pitched on its news tab include the Journal\u2019s publisher, Dow Jones, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nWhile many in the news industry welcomed Google\u2019s algorithm tweak to help original reporting rank higher on Google News, several said they would reserve judgment until they could ascertain whether the change was making an impact.\n\n\u201cWith all of these things, you don\u2019t know what it means until you see it in practice,\u201d said David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, a trade coalition representing some 2,000 news organizations in the U.S. and Canada, including Dow Jones.\n\nMr. Gingras wrote in a blog post last week that Google had made changes to keep stories containing significant original reporting higher in search rankings for longer. It also had changed guidelines for some 10,000 human raters charged with checking the algorithms\u2019 work, to give greater prominence to news sites with reputations for producing high-quality journalism and with records of industry awards, such as the Pulitzer Prize.\n\n\u201cWe have long argued that provenance must be a priority and so applaud any change that actually highlights the qualitative difference in journalism and ends the crass commodification of content,\u201d News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said in a statement. \u201cWe will closely monitor these alterations to the algorithm and trust that the promised reforms do indeed eventuate.\u201d\n\nNews Corp, the Journal\u2019s parent company, has been developing a news-aggregation service called Knewz.com that is designed, in part, to promote original reporting over quick rehashes of existing articles.\n\nGoogle\u2019s rating-guideline change raised concern among conservative publishers who have long claimed big platforms have a liberal bias that leads them to unfairly downgrade right-leaning articles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy about this if they implement it fairly,\u201d said Neil Patel, co-founder and publisher of the Daily Caller. \u201cBut with Google, there has always been a lot of opacity about how they run their algorithms, and the worry is there will be a similar lack of transparency about how they define who they think is a respected publisher.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been offering news outlets as much as $3 million a year in licensing fees to use headlines and article previews in a special news section it aims to launch later this year, the Journal reported last month. The social-media platform has been offering some smaller, regional publishers fees in the range of $500,000 annually, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nNews Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti have both called on Facebook and Google to pay organizations that provide quality news.\n\n\u201cThose of us who do a lot of original reporting are thrilled Google is fixing this frustrating bug, but we\u2019re still waiting for Google and some other platforms to follow Facebook\u2019s lead in recognizing the real value they extract from our original journalism,\u201d said Ben Smith, BuzzFeed\u2019s editor in chief.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple announced a partnership with more than 300 magazines and several digital media outlets and newspapers, including the Journal, for a $9.99 a month subscription news bundle called Apple News+. As part of the deal, publishers would split 50% of the revenue based on readership of their stories.\n\nWrite to Lukas I.
