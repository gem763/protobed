But the story is nonsense in every which way.\n\nIt now looks as if Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelensky is at the center of the whistleblower complaint that top Trump officials have refused to transmit to Congress, in violation of the law, though this has not been publicly confirmed.\n\nThe emerging spin from Trump\u2019s propagandists is that Trump didn\u2019t \u201cpressure\u201d Zelensky to dig dirt on Biden and that there was no explicit quid pro quo involving the military aid.\n\nBut this spin is a joke. The already known facts are damning enough. To simplify this story, I created this timeline of it:\n\nSeptember 2018: Congress approves military aid to Ukraine, per House Democratic sources.\n\nFeb. 28, 2019: Congressional officials are notified that the administration is set to release large amounts of that aid. It doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nMay 19: Trump goes on Fox News and rails about Biden and Ukraine, falsely claiming that Biden improperly pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was supposedly \u201cafter\u201d his son.\n\nMay 23: Congress is again notified of a pending release of aid. It again doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nJuly 18th or thereabouts: Trump orders Mulvaney to freeze the aid to Ukraine. Trump\u2019s decision is communicated to officials at the State and Defense departments. Importantly, as The Post reports, officials are instructed to tell lawmakers that the delay stemmed from some kind of \u201cinteragency process,\u201d but not to share any more details.\n\nJuly 24: The special counsel testifies to Congress, and Trump hails the proceedings as a \u201cvery good day.\u201d While the special counsel detailed extraordinary corruption and wrongdoing, Trump plainly takes from it that he can conduct himself with total impunity.\n\nJuly 25: Trump holds a call with Zelensky. Trump himself will later admit he brought up Biden and \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine. It is also subsequently reported that Trump directly urged Zelensky to discuss this with Giuliani.\n\nLate July: A few days after that call, Giuliani meets with an aide to Zelensky, and demands an investigation into Biden. Giuliani later admits he would not be doing this without discussing it with Trump.\n\nAug. 12: The inspector general of the intelligence community receives a complaint from a whistleblower.\n\nAug. 26: The inspector general forwards the whistleblower complaint to the DNI, saying he deemed it of \u201curgent concern\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nAug. 30: CNN reports that Trump is seriously looking at blocking the aid entirely, and that the Pentagon privately advised for the aid to be released.\n\nEarly September: Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) speaks to Zelensky. Murphy has since characterized their conversation by saying that Zelensky \u201cdirectly\u201d expressed concerns that the cutoff of aid was a \u201cconsequence\u201d of failing to probe Biden.\n\nSept. 9: The inspector general alerts the congressional intelligence committees to the whistleblower complaint, and says the DNI hasn\u2019t forwarded it to them, in potential violation of the law.\n\nSept. 10: Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, demands that the DNI transmit the whistleblower complaint to Congress.\n\nSept. 12: The aid to Ukraine is released.\n\nSept. 13: Schiff subpoenas the DNI for the whistleblower complaint.\n\nSept. 17: The DNI again formally refuses to turn over the whistleblower complaint, arguing that the law doesn\u2019t apply, because the activity in question relates to \u201csomeone\u201d outside the intelligence community. Reporting indicates that the DNI did this after getting advised to do so by the Justice Department.\n\nSept. 17: The inspector general pushes back hard on the DNI\u2019s decision, flatly stating that the complaint \u201crelates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI\u2019s responsibilities to the American people.\u201d\n\nSept. 18-19: It turns out the \u201csomeone\u201d in question may be Trump himself. The Post scoops that the whistleblower complaint involved a \u201cpromise\u201d Trump made to a foreign leader. We then learn that it also involves Ukraine.\n\nSept. 19: Giuliani first denies to CNN that he is pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, before reversing and confirming as much.\n\nSept. 22: Trump confirms he brought up Biden and corruption in the call with Zelensky, but top administration officials deny Trump \u201cpressured\u201d him to investigate Biden.\n\nSo here\u2019s what we know: As the timeline shows, Trump was thinking hard about Biden and Ukraine well in advance of ordering the aid frozen. At the same time, many officials in Trump\u2019s own administration were deliberately kept in the dark about Trump\u2019s rationale for freezing the aid.\n\nDoes that prove a connection? No, and we still don\u2019t know whether Trump explicitly threatened to withhold the aid while making his demand of Zelensky, but this sequence makes a connection seem very plausible.\n\nRegardless, the timeline shows that this constitutes extraordinarily serious misconduct even if Trump didn\u2019t offer any explicit quid pro quo. Ukraine badly wanted the aid, and Zelensky told Murphy that Trump made him feel like there was a connection.\n\nBoth Trump and Giuliani have openly flaunted their own efforts to get Ukraine to dig dirt on Biden. Trump did this literally the day after the special counsel\u2019s testimony persuaded him he can operate with impunity.\n\nTrump\u2019s top officials then corruptly concealed the \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d whistleblower complaint from Congress \u2014 and we then only learned that Trump\u2019s pressure on Zelensky appeared to be at the center of that complaint through dogged reporting.\n\nNo matter how you cut this, Trump used the power of the presidency to try to leverage a foreign power into interfering in the election on his behalf. And his top officials appear to be breaking the law to prevent Congress from getting to the bottom of it.\n\nRead more:\n\nSeven freshman national-security Democrats: These allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect\n\nMike Murphy: I\u2019m a Republican.
