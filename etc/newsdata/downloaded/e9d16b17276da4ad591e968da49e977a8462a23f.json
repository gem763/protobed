Prices had firmed 0.5% last week on fears of\n\ncooling global growth.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 slipped 0.1% to $1,511.00 per\n\nounce.\n\nThe next round of U.S-China trade talks are set to be held\n\nin Washington on Oct. 10-11, although hopes of progress\n\ndiminished after a report that Chinese officials wanted the\n\nscope of this week's negotiations to be narrow. There is uncertainty regarding the trade negotiations. China\n\nseems to be very reluctant to agree, said Margaret Yang Yan, a\n\nmarket analyst at CMC Markets. \"There is demand for safe haven\n\nassets, which reflects a very cautious mood towards the trade\n\ndeal.\"\n\nThe long-drawn trade tussle between the world's two largest\n\neconomies has toppled markets globally and triggered fears of a\n\npossible recession.\n\n\"Gold has been in a range of less than $100. It will take a\n\nstrong catalyst to bring gold out of this channel,\" Yan said,\n\nadding that quantitative easing by the U.S. Fed, European\n\nCentral Bank and Bank of Japan could be a major factor.\n\nJobs growth in the United States slowed in September and\n\nwage growth stalled, even as unemployment dropped to a 50-year\n\nlow, a report on Friday showed. But that did little to change market expectations that the\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates at its next\n\npolicy review on Oct. 29-30 to support the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, China's foreign exchange reserves fell more than\n\nexpected in September amid a cooling domestic economy and the\n\nrising trade tensions. Spot gold may test a support at $1,488 per ounce, a break\n\nbelow which could cause a fall towards the range of\n\n$1,446-$1,462, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\nAmong other metals, platinum XPT= rose 0.3% to $878.87,\n\nsilver dipped 0.1% to $17.54 and palladium XPD= was\n\nlittle changed at $1,665.67.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRECIOUS-Gold edges up ahead of Sino-U.S. trade talks", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold edges up ahead of Sino-U.S. trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/gbp_usd_3_800x533_L_1411987810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
