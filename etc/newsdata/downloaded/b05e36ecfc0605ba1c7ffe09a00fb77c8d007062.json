(Mark J. Terrill, File)\n\nWhen it comes to his sister, Curtis Ingraham doesn\u2019t exactly hold back.\n\nOver the past year or so, Ingraham has won a reputation \u2014 and a significant Twitter following \u2014 for attacks on his high-profile sister, Fox News host Laura Ingraham. At different times and on a wide variety of platforms, he has called his sibling \u201ca monster,\u201d \u201ca Nazi sympathizer\u201d and a \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nBut after the controversial pundit compared Greta Thunberg and other youth climate activists to Stephen King\u2019s \u201cChildren of the Corn\u201d on Monday night, Curtis Ingraham took things to the next level.\n\n\u201cClearly my sister\u2019s paycheck is more important than the world her three adopted kids will inherit,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in a post that had garnered roughly 60,000 likes \u2014 and climbing \u2014 as of Tuesday morning. \u201cI can no longer apologize for a sibling who I no longer recognize.\u201d\n\n[A Fox News guest called Greta Thunberg 'mentally ill.' The network apologized for the 'disgraceful' comment.]\n\nExperts in political discourse said Curtis Ingraham\u2019s decision to invoke his sister\u2019s children marks an escalation in their ongoing feud. Children have typically been viewed as an out-of-bounds subject in American public debate, although that norm has eroded over the past several years, according to University of New Hampshire professor Lawrence J. Prelli.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely making it more personal,\u201d Prelli said. \u201cBut I have to say, it\u2019s ironic to be parsing out how this could be mean to Laura Ingraham. . . . What about her framing this girl as demented?\u201d\n\nCurtis Ingraham could not immediately be reached for comment, and Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStephen King\u2019s 1977 short story \u201cChildren of the Corn\u201d \u2014 later made into a popular movie \u2014 focuses on a murderous gang of children who live in cornfields in rural Nebraska, dress in Amish-style clothing and worship a vengeful deity called \u201cHe Who Walks Behind the Rows.\u201d Their god demands they murder all adults in the town.\n\nDuring the Sept. 23 edition of her show, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d Laura Ingraham drew a parallel between the fictional cornfield cult and the young people leading a global movement to combat climate change. Her remarks came on the same day that Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old from Sweden who has become the face of climate advocacy, delivered an impassioned address before the United Nations urging leaders around the world to take action.\n\n\u201cThe adults who\u2019ve brainwashed these kids should be brought up on charges of child abuse,\u201d Laura Ingraham said, speaking before a graphic bearing Thunberg\u2019s face and the words, \u201cThe Climatology Cult.\u201d\n\nShe later played a clip of Thunberg speaking at the United Nations, followed by an excerpt from the movie version of Stephen King\u2019s novel. In the excerpt, a child cult leader paces past cornstalks, fingering a weapon, and declares: \u201cA time of tribulation has come! A test is at hand, the final test.\u201d\n\n[Teen girls are leading the climate strikes and helping change the face of environmentalism]\n\n\u201cDoes anyone else find that chilling?\u201d Laura Ingraham asked, before concluding: \u201cI can\u2019t wait for Stephen King\u2019s sequel, \u2018Children of the Climate.\u2019\u201d\n\nHer comments spurred immediate backlash on Twitter. And she was not the only Fox pundit to draw fire for opining on the teenage climate activist: The network was forced to apologize to Thunberg on Tuesday after Michael Knowles, a guest on its show, \u201cThe Story,\u201d called her \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Thunberg, who was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome years ago, has called her condition \u201ca gift,\u201d saying it inspired her advocacy.\n\nIf anyone broke the \u201cconstraint upon criticizing children, generally,\u201d Prelli said, it was Laura Ingraham \u2014 not her brother.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty naked and ad hominem attack, to be characterizing this girl as somehow demented or evil,\u201d Prelli said of Laura Ingraham\u2019s remarks. By contrast, Curtis Ingraham \u201cis not criticizing her children,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s referring to them as children who have a future who can be impacted by climate change \u2014 I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s at all out of bounds.\u201d\n\nCurtis Ingraham \u2014 a teacher who lives in Northern California, according to the Daily Beast \u2014 began speaking out about his sister in early 2018, at the time tweeting to an audience of several hundred. His commentary swiftly earned him fans: Today, his followers number more than 21,000.\n\n[Laura Ingraham promoted a white supremacist on her show. At least one advertise is pulling out.]\n\nThe siblings have long had a complicated relationship, the Daily Beast reported. They hold sharply different political views \u2014 a divide exacerbated by the fact that Curtis Ingraham is gay. Although they were close at an earlier period of their lives, the two have \u201cvery limited contact at this point,\u201d he told the Daily Beast in a 2018 interview.\n\nHe added that his sister\u2019s prominent role as a right-wing analyst on Fox News \u2014 Laura earned her own prime-time show in September 2017 \u2014 all but destroyed their ties. Since her show debuted, Laura Ingraham has been accused of racism, anti-Semitism and of promoting white supremacy. The network has vehemently defended her every time.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy for me,\u201d Curtis Ingraham told the Daily Beast. \u201cMy heart has been bruised; it has been kind of irreparably bruised. But I\u2019m trying to illuminate and shed a light on hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the only social-media-fueled division between family members to garner headlines in the Trump era. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway\u2019s husband, lawyer George Conway, has earned a massive Twitter following as a devastating critic of President Trump \u2014 his wife\u2019s boss.\n\nRead more:\n\nA teen activist refused to take a gas-guzzling plane to a U.N. summit.
