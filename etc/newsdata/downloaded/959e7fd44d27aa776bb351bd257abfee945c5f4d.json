We\u2019ll see how he goes this season first, I hope he can keep up his form from last season.\u201d\n\nWhile Exultant won the Hong Kong Gold Cup and was runner-up in the QE II Cup over 2,000m at Group One level last term, Cruz says he is \u201creally a mile-and-a-half horse\u201d and the gelding is full steam ahead in his defence of the Hong Kong Vase (2,400m) on international day.\n\nHe trialled for the first time this season on Friday, travelling quietly at the back of the field under regular rider Zac Purton in a performance that ticked the boxes for Cruz.\n\n\u201cI was very happy with his trial, he\u2019s got one more trial before the Ladies\u2019 Purse [on November 3],\u201d he said. \u201cHorses like him, there are no earlier preparation races for them. I\u2019m happy with him and Zac is very happy with the horse.\u201d\n\nWhile last season Exultant began his campaign over a mile, Cruz has confirmed he will go straight to the Group Three Sa Sa Ladies\u2019 Purse (1,800m) this time around, before having his final tune-up for the Vase in the Group Two Jockey Club Cup (2,000m) on November 17.\n\nStablemate Time Warp also looks likely to follow the same path, at least to begin with, before potentially having another crack at the Hong Kong Cup, which he won in 2017.\n\nThe dual Group One winner was in the same trial as Exultant, moving freely in a close second to John Moore\u2019s Good Standing, but whether he can again be competitive at the highest level remains to be seen.\n\nAfter winning the Ladies\u2019 Purse last term, Time Warp finished third in last year\u2019s Hong Kong Cup but failed to have an impact at Group One level in three further attempts.\n\n\u201cLast season he didn\u2019t live up to his reputation, let\u2019s see how he goes this season,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nOne thing that could work in Time Warp\u2019s favour is his stint in Conghua, with Cruz suggesting the six-year-old is a calmer animal after his first trip to the mainland.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very happy at Conghua, he likes it and he\u2019s very relaxed. He\u2019s a bit better in his mind, he\u2019s very quiet now,\u201d he said.", "description": "Tony Cruz says a more mature Exultant is now ready for the rigours of international travel as Hong Kong\u2019s best stayer prepares to carry on from where he left off last season....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/11/9d0854fa-ebe3-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_150017.JPG?itok=1Aht-oll&v=1570777224", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
