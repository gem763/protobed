These chips were shipped in iPhones and iPads released between 2011 and 2017, and spanning eight generations of devices, from iPhone 4S to iPhone 8 and X.\n\nMust read: iOS 13: Security and privacy settings you need to tweak and check\n\nThis is an unpatchable exploit because, as opposed to a software bug that can be updated, this vulnerability is baked into the chipset.\n\nIt's right inside the hardware.\n\nEPIC JAILBREAK: Introducing checkm8 (read \"checkmate\"), a permanent unpatchable bootrom exploit for hundreds of millions of iOS devices.\n\n\n\nMost generations of iPhones and iPads are vulnerable: from iPhone 4S (A5 chip) to iPhone 8 and iPhone X (A11 chip). https://t.co/dQJtXb78sG \u2014 axi0mX (@axi0mX) September 27, 2019\n\nSo, what can you do to protect yourself or your company?\n\nThe only comfort for affected iPhone and iPad owners here is that this exploit requires physical access to the device and can only be triggered over USB, and it cannot be executed remotely. For the average user, this probably downgrades the severity of this vulnerability, but it will be of little comfort to companies who have hundreds, or even thousands of iPhones and iPads deployed.\n\nEndpoint software will also likely be useful in spotting compromised devices, but there are gaps in that sort of security (for example, it still leaves the data on the device vulnerable).\n\nThe other option is to buy new hardware.\n\nFor the average user, this exploit is nothing to worry about, but for enterprise users it is likely to be a headache that will hang around until the old iPhones and iPads are replaced with new iPhones and iPads.\n\nSee also:", "description": "The release of a new jailbreak that works on iPhones and iPads spanning eight generations of devices presents a possible major headache to those concerned about security.
