Jim Himes (D-CT) on impeachment, asking him what the House Democrats are waiting for when it comes to voting on articles of impeachment given that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) believes there is ample evidence of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump.\n\nCamerota asked Himes why not vote on articles of impeachment now, to which Himes said House Democrats \u201cneed an opportunity to talk to the witnesses who were in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of articles of impeachment,\u201d Camerota posed, \u201cit sounds as though Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi now believes there is ample evidence of obstruction of justice given that the Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u2019s appearance was canceled, given this letter and that there is evidence of asking a foreign power for help investigating a political rival in the upcoming election. We\u2019ve all seen the transcript. So, what are you waiting for? Why not vote on the articles of impeachment now?\u201d\n\n\u201c[I]mpeachment is a serious thing, Alisyn, and we need an opportunity to talk to the witnesses who were in the room,\u201d Himes replied. \u201cLook, despite what the president is saying, the whistleblower complaint is very specific and it is fully corroborated as you point out by the so-called transcript that the White House put out there, and by the way, by the president himself, who looked into a whole bunch of television cameras and said, \u2018Hey China, you too ought to investigate Joe Biden.\u2019 You know, you\u2019re right, the facts aren\u2019t really much in dispute here but you know, you don\u2019t rush to judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do away with a lot of the absolute baloney that people like the secretary of state of the United States of America have been putting out there so the American people understand the facts about what is happening here,\u201d he later added.\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During Wednesday's \"New Day\" on CNN, host Alisyn Camerota pressed Rep.
