Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused her, without evidence, of being a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democratic establishment has got to stop smearing women it finds inconvenient! The character assassination of women who don\u2019t toe the party line will backfire,\u201d Williamson wrote on Twitter. \u201cStay strong @TulsiGabbard . You deserve respect and you have mine.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic establishment has got to stop smearing women it finds inconvenient! The character assassination of women who don\u2019t toe the party line will backfire. Stay strong @TulsiGabbard . You deserve respect and you have mine. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) October 19, 2019\n\nWilliamson is only the second Democrat presidential candidate to express support for Gabbard. On Friday, Andrew Yang responded to Clinton\u2019s bizarre attack on Gabbard by stating the military combat veteran \u201cdeserves much more respect and thanks than this.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe literally just got back from serving our country abroad,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier Friday, Clinton trashed Gabbard as \u201cthe favorite of the Russians,\u201d who was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by the Kremlin as a potential third-party candidate.\n\nAppearing Friday on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign manager, the failed presidential candidate claimed:\n\n[Russia] has a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting [Gabbard] so far. That\u2019s assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not because she is also a Russian asset. They know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it.\n\nHours later, Gabbard hit back at Clinton in a series of tweets, labeling her the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and the culprit behind a New York Times hit piece prior to Tuesday\u2019s Democrat presidential debate:\n\n\u2026 concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and \u2026 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\n\u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nOn Saturday, Gabbard (D-HI) used Clinton\u2019s attack to raise money for her presidential campaign.\n\n\u201c[Clinton] finally came out from behind the curtain yesterday, accusing me of being a Russian asset,\u201d a fundraising email to supporters read.\n\n\u201cIf this is a fight she wants to have, one that has implications for all of us and the future of our democracy, then I challenge her to come out from behind her proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media, and face me directly,\u201d it concluded.", "description": "Marianne Williamson defended fellow White House hopeful Tulsi Gabbard after Hillary Clinton accused her of being a \"Russian asset.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1165994613-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
