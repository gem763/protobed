He was killed but it still doesn't bring my son back.'\n\nThe parents revealed that they were notified by the FBI just prior to the attack on Baghdadi's Syrian compound but were not given any specific details about what it involved or who it targeted.\n\nThey received a phone call from Trump soon after they saw news reports of Baghdadi's death.\n\nThe Sotloffs said President Trump told them he knew Steven was smiling down from heaven knowing the ISIS leader was dead.\n\nIn a press conference outside their Florida home later on Sunday, Shirley read a statement on behalf of the family that addressed the ISIS leader's death.\n\nSotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist taken hostage in Syria in 2013, was murdered on camera the following year by the ISIS militant notoriously known as Jihadi John\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi (above) blew himself up after being cornered by U.S forces in a dead-end underground tunnel in his Syrian compound\n\n'The Sotloff family is grateful to President Trump, our brave U.S. Special Forces and all involved intelligence allies for pinpointing and eliminating ISIS leader al-Baghdadi without suffering any U.S. Military casualties,' she said.\n\n'While the victory will not bring our beloved son Steven back to us, it is a significant step in the campaign against ISIS.'\n\nSotloff was among a group of about 20 Westerners taken hostage at the same time and tortured by ISIS militants.\n\nISIS beheaded a total of seven U.S., British and Japanese journalists and aid workers, as well as a group of Syrian soldiers. Sotloff was among them.\n\nThe daring raid on the compound where Baghdadi was hiding in Syria on Saturday was the culmination of years of steady intelligence-gathering work - and 48 hours of hurry-up planning once Washington got word on where he would be.\n\nThe daring raid on the compound (above) where Baghdadi was hiding in Syria was the culmination of years of steady intelligence-gathering work - and 48 hours of hurry-up planning once Washington got word on where he would be\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning. His lair was in a village known for smuggling, and he arrived there 48 hours before the raid\n\nTrump watched the raid in real time from the Situation Room via a video link as troops blasted into the hideout and sent the most-wanted militant running the last steps of his life.\n\nTrump said soldiers blasted a hole in the side of a building because they feared the entrance might have been booby-trapped.\n\nBaghdadi fled into a network of underground bunkers and tunnels that snaked through the compound.\n\nThe stout, bearded militant leader wore a suicide vest and dragged along three children as he fled from the American troops.\n\nTrump, happy to play up the drama, said that as U.S. troops and their dogs closed in, the militant went 'whimpering and crying and screaming all the way' to his death.\n\n'He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down,' Trump said. 'He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.'", "description": "Steven Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist taken hostage in Syria in 2013, was murdered on camera the following year by the ISIS militant notoriously known as Jihadi John.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/15/20330466-0-image-a-36_1572363110594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
