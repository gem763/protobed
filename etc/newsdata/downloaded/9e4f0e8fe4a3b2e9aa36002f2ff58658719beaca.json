As the safest region in Syria, pluralism is the norm.\n\nNot one bullet has been fired at Turkey from this territory. But it is this emerging administration\u2019s pluralism and affirmative feminism that poses a threat to the ruling Islamist-fascist coalition in Turkey.\n\nErdogan repeatedly claims that he intends to forcibly re-settle the three million displaced Syrian Arabs, who have taken refuge in Turkey, in this part of Syria. This means driving out the Kurdish local population and replacing it with an Arab population. It has a name: ethnic cleansing.\n\nSaddam Hussein did the same in Iraqi Kurdistan.
