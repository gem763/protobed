Yet most party leaders and voters agreed that being a married gay man would cause some discomfort with religious or conservative black Democrats.\n\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality may be a factor with religious and white conservative voters as well, but black Democrats are a focal point because they were critical to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and others winning the party nomination in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issue for him is he\u2019s married to a man,\u201d said Phyllis Harris-Drakeford, the Democratic chairwoman of Kershaw County, S.C. \u201cI have no problem with that: You love who you want to love and you have the freedom in this country to do that. But in the South in particular, that\u2019s not well favored.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Pete-Buttigieg-South-Carolina.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
