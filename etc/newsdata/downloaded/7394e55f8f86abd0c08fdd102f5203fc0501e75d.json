If people can find the spot and stimulate it through penetration using the penis or fingers, the theory goes, women can have out-of-this-world orgasms without any other stimulation.\n\n\u201cIf your partner is on her back and you insert a finger with your palm facing the ceiling, the \u2018top side\u2019 of her vagina is the spot you\u2019ll touch by curling your finger in a come-hither motion, almost like you\u2019re trying to stroke her belly button from the inside,\u201d reads one article from Men\u2019s Health.\n\nOn Cosmopolitan UK\u2019s website, a writer says women can find their own G-spots by sticking a finger about one-third of the way into their vaginas where they will feel the \u201cspongy area.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re aroused, your G-spot hardens, gets rougher (sort of like a walnut) and doubles in size,\u201d according to the article.\n\nBut according to gynecologist and \u201cThe Vagina Bible\u201d author Dr. Jen Gunter, recent research suggests the G-spot doesn\u2019t even exist. And even if it does, believing finding it is the key to out-of-this-world orgasms is dangerous since sexual pleasure is more complicated than touching one area of the body and calling it a day.\n\nRead more: 17 times celebrities got brutally honest about sex\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising to me when I hear of women who fake orgasms with male partners,\u201d Gunter wrote. \u201cAfter all, they have been led to believe that a female orgasm should be reached with a penis by way of a imaginary spot.\u201d\n\nRecent research suggests the G-spot doesn\u2019t even exist\n\nResearchers who have more recently studied this concept have been unable to locate this special spot Gr\u00e4fenberg described decades ago, even with the use of imaging scans and biopsies.\n\nGunter said it\u2019s likely that Gr\u00e4fenberg misconstrued other parts of a woman\u2019s genitals, like the nerve ending-packed clitoris, as this seemingly new discovery of the G-spot.\n\n\u201cThe lower part of the vagina, close to the urethra, will feel great for many women because stimulation here is accessing the clitoris, but it takes the right stimulation \u2013 it is not an \u2018on/off switch,'\u201d Gunter wrote.\n\nBelieving that area works like a button is dangerous because that can lead both men and women to believe that a woman should be able to orgasm through G-spot stimulation alone, Gunter said in the book. If she can\u2019t, they conclude something is wrong with her body.\n\ncaption The idea that the G-spot holds the key to the perfect female orgasm is untrue and has resulted in unfair societal expectations around the concept of a woman\u2019s pleasure. source Caroline Praderio/INSIDER\n\nClitoral stimulation provides the best chance for orgasm\n\nGunter said that ultrasounds that examined the clitoris during masturbation and vaginal penetration revealed that both actions cause the clitoris to swell, meaning that various form of sexual stimulation, whether they involve physically touching the clitoris or not, result in the brain sending pleasure signals to the clitoris.\n\n\u201cBasically, all pleasure roads lead to the clitoris,\u201d Gunter wrote.\n\nConversely, the idea that the G-spot holds the key to the perfect female orgasm is untrue and has resulted in unfair societal expectations around the concept of a woman\u2019s pleasure, which can be achieved in plenty of other ways that aren\u2019t focused solely on the inside of the vagina.\n\nFor example, nipple and anal stimulation can result in sexual pleasure and even orgasm for some people. The brain also plays an essential role in sexual function and pleasure. Without proper brain signals, the body doesn\u2019t know how to to become sexually aroused, regardless of what area or areas are being touched.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Business Insider - Recent research suggests the supposed pleasure center doesn't exist.
