How accurate were they and what, if anything, did they correctly predict?\n\nSix years is a long time and fans have become increasingly anxious and excited about a follow up to GTA V. And as fans get more desperate for information and leaks, rumours about GTA 6 become more and more common. But should fans trust any of these rumours? How accurate were rumours about GTA V before the game was released?\n\nGTA V Will Star A Police Officer (Or Maybe Not)\n\nThis is a rumour that popped up in various places before GTA V was officially announced. The exact details varied depending on the site or forum post, but the basic idea was that players would control a rookie cop in Los Santos or L.A. They would encounter characters from GTA San Andreas and players would be able to arrest criminals, respond to police calls and decide to be dirty or good cops.\n\nOf course, all of this was complete hogwash and most GTA forum-goers and fans seemed to realise this rumour was complete garbage. However, I did occasionally see reference of this rumour in the lead up to GTA V\u2019s official reveal, so for some, it seemed believable enough to share with others.\n\nOne odd thing about this rumour is that a few places that posted this rumour did predict that GTA V would use a weapon wheel like Red Dead Redemption. But this is honestly just a smart guess based on Rockstar\u2019s history of taking elements from past games and bringing them into future games.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just a cop that was rumoured to be the star of GTA V. Another popular rumour claimed the star of the game was actually Albert De Silva, a man from Vice City who has settled down to have kids in Los Santos. This sounds accurate to the story of GTA V, but remember that this rumour popped up after the first trailer.\n\nIn that trailer, the main character explains they wanted to start a family, settle down, etc. It\u2019s not hard to predict the story when a trailer lays out the setup. And the other details are wrong because those aren\u2019t revealed in the trailer, so whoever created this rumour had to fill in the gaps and guessed.\n\n\u201cLeaked\u201d Maps\n\nRockstar open-world games are known for their large and highly detailed maps. So it makes sense that people would be excited to learn about GTA V\u2019s map long before the game was released. Because of this, many, many, MANY, fake maps were posted online claiming to be leaked images of the real GTA V map.\n\nSome of these maps seemed REALLY plausible and were covered by various sites, including Kotaku.\n\nBut none of these ended up being the real map. Some were close, most were just fantasies featuring multiple cities and islands.\n\nNow, occasionally real maps will leak out ahead of a Rockstar release. For example, GTA V\u2019s map leaked a few days before release after some fans got their hands on early copies of the GTA V strategy guide. And the map for Red Dead Redemption 2 leaked well before the game\u2019s release, back in 2016.\n\nSo these things do happen, but it\u2019s rare. More often than not leaked maps are just Photoshop creations made by trolls and bored fans.\n\nToo Good To Be True Rumours\n\nA lot of the rumours and \u201cleaks\u201d that popped up before GTA V\u2019s official reveal and subsequent release are filled with ideas that sound amazing and also, probably, impossible to actually implement. For example, a few popular rumours that floated around claimed the game would have seasons, with extreme weather like snow and floods. None of this was true.\n\nOther rumours suggested multiple cities or that Los Santos would be bigger than GTA IV\u2019s entire map and the outside countryside would be gigantic and filled with small towns.\n\nAnother popular rumour claimed there was going to be a demo at E3 2013. This should immediately set off red flags to anyone reading it. Rockstar is known for rarely appearing at E3 in any capacity. Sometimes their games will appear on a stage show, but they never have a big booth or stations where people can play their games. That just ain\u2019t how Rockstar does things. Any rumour claiming E3 demos or big E3 gameplay reveals is most likely made-up nonsense.\n\nWhile Rockstar is filled with talented studios and developers, some of these rumours claimed things that sound impossible to pull off on current generation consoles, let alone Xbox 360 or PS3. Like dynamic traffic reports on the radio or having nearly every building be enterable.\n\nAccurate Pre-Release Information\n\nWhile many different sites and forums were filled with various rumours, many of which turned out to be wrong, some reports ahead of the game nailed it. Kotaku got information from a source in 2011 that GTA V was going to be set in Los Santos, and that it also would star multiple playable characters. Both of these things proved to be correct.\n\nThe big difference between this information and some of the other rumours mentioned in this post is clear. Nothing in here sounds too outlandish, it all seems like a natural evolution of previous GTA games.\n\nNot only that but Stephen Totilo is a great reporter and can be trusted. He and others at Kotaku have a long and proven history of getting information about games before they are announced. This information isn\u2019t just made up or grabbed from a random forum post.\n\nGrand Theft Auto 6 Rumours\n\nLooking back at GTA V rumours, it turns out that most of them were entirely wrong. Which isn\u2019t surprising. Random rumours spread on forums and Twitter are hard to prove and easy to make up. And as hype for the next GTA continues to build, be careful about trusting rumours that might show up online.\n\nRemember these tips when reading a new rumour:\n\nDoes this sound like a real list of features or a fan just listing off their dream GTA features?\n\nRockstar keeps the older GTA games separate from the modern games. So any rumour claiming \u201cCJ is back\u201d should be ignored.\n\nDoes the map or HUD on a leaked screenshot look a lot like GTA V or another open-world game? If so, it\u2019s probably fake.\n\nRockstar ain\u2019t showing gameplay at E3, so don\u2019t believe rumours that claim otherwise.\n\nI get people being excited for GTA 6 but don\u2019t let that excitement cloud your judgment. Take every rumour with a grain of salt and always assume random people on the internet are just trolling.
