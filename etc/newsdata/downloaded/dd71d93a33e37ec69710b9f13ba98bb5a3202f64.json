So, are they giant eels? Well, our data doesn't reveal their size, but the sheer quantity of the material says that we can't discount the possibility that there may be giant eels in Loch Ness.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Therefore we can't discount the possibility that what people see and believe is the Loch Ness monster might be a giant eel.\"\n\nEuropean eels can grow up to 5 feet, according to the USGS. They have a diet that consists of insect larvae, mollusks, worms and crustaceans. They're also able to \"survive near freezing temperatures\" and are seen as \"remarkably mobile,\" capable of moving over dams, weirs and even land, adding credence to Gemmell's findings.\n\nGemmell, who first announced the study in May 2018, said last month that one theory was \"plausible\" in attempting to explain the fabled Nessie.\n\nIn addition, the ideas that sturgeon or Greenland sharks lived in the loch were also put to rest after Gemmell said no DNA of either creature had been found among the 250 water samples taken from various depths.\n\nLOCH NESS MONSTER: THIS IS SCOTLAND'S PLAN IF THE FABLED BEAST IS CAUGHT\n\nGemmell's research was established to find what types of plants and animals live in the loch and not specifically to find the mythical creature, but Gemmell conceded that his work did add to the legend.\n\n\"People love a mystery, we've used science to add another chapter to Loch Ness' mystique,\" he said, according to the BBC.\n\nOne of Scotland's oldest myths, the story that a creature was living in Loch Ness, dates back to the sixth century. The 19th and 20th centuries, in particular, saw an increase in interest, especially after the infamous \"surgeon's photograph\" in 1934.\n\nA study published in April suggested that the legend of the Loch Ness monster and other long-necked \"sea monsters\" may have been influenced by something very real and even more terrifying \u2014 dinosaurs.\n\nThe legend of the Loch Ness monster has commonly been attributed to a plesiosaur that somehow managed to survive the mass extinction event that killed off the dinosaurs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "After months of speculation surrounding a study into whether the Loch Ness monster was real, the researcher behind it has claimed it could be a giant eel and\u00a0not a giant plesiosaur from a long-lost era.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/sci-loch-ness-monster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
