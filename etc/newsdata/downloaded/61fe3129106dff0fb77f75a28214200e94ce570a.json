A robust study in the United Kingdom found that vaping is twice as effective as other common nicotine replacements in getting smokers to quit. The flavors, according to surveys of users, are a big draw for smokers quitting traditional cigarettes.\n\nIt\u2019s manifestly absurd to ban vaping products and leave cigarettes, including flavored cigarettes, on the market.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Nypost.Com The-Utterly-Political-War-On-Vaping"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
