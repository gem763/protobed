REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nThe state-run World Internet Conference, one of the country\u2019s most prominent tech events, took place this year against a backdrop of rising Sino-U.S. frictions and has been especially overshadowed by Washington\u2019s moves against Chinese tech companies.\n\nThe United States earlier this month placed several Chinese AI companies on a supplier blacklist and trade talks between both countries show little sign of any quick resolution.\n\nAttendees in previous years included the heads of Google and Apple Inc. In 2017, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the conference that the company shared China\u2019s vision for developing a digital economy for openness.\n\nBut this year\u2019s three-day event, which ended on Tuesday, drew few American luminaries and did not feature a U.S.-China panel like last year, reflecting the heightened tensions between the United States and China.\n\nIn his opening remarks, China\u2019s propaganda chief Huang Kunming set the overall tone with the criticism that the cyberspace industry was being hindered by a \u201cCold War\u201d mentality and \u201cbully behavior,\u201d a barely veiled jibe at the United States.\n\n\u201cNo sanctions or restrictions can hinder China\u2019s development or the development of Chinese enterprises,\u201d Yang Shuzhen, the head of the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace Studies, a government-backed think tank, told reporters at the conference.\n\n\u201cNo country\u2019s enterprise can cover all the world\u2019s technical patents, components and equipment. The irreversible trend is that all countries rely on the support of the global market.\u201d\n\nSPYING AND AI\n\nIn May, Washington ramped up pressure on China by placing Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], the world\u2019s largest telecoms equipment provider, on a U.S. blacklist over national security concerns, banning it from buying American-made parts without a special license.\n\nThe U.S. government, fearing Huawei equipment could be used to spy on customers, has led a campaign to convince allies to bar it from their 5G networks. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claims.\n\nSome attendees told Reuters that they were seeing efforts by the Chinese government to allocate more resources toward the tech sector to compete with the United States.\n\n\u201cThe trade tensions have indeed impacted on our local traditional businesses, including the apparel industry and fiberglass manufacturers, said a local government official who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n\u201cBut we are trying our best to encourage high-tech businesses to set up operations here, such as renewable energy-driven vehicles and self-driving cars,\u201d the official added.\n\nStill, many speakers including Alibaba chairman Daniel Zhang and Microsoft\u2019s Artificial Intelligence & Research executive vice-president Harry Shum, avoided discussing the \u2018entity list\u2019 or other thorny topics publicly.\n\nHuawei and Megvii were also among 15 companies awarded prizes by the conference organizers for new product innovations, but no mention was made of the troubles they may face from being put on Washington\u2019s trade blacklist.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that everyone\u2019s avoiding the problems,\u201d said one U.S. attendee.\n\n\u201cThere is not a candid discussion of the problems foreign companies face in China, or some of the larger problems having to do with internet governance in China. Rather, there\u2019s technological boosterism,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers also tip-toed around the issue of the months-long protests in Hong Kong, even as a seminar was organized to discuss internet innovation in the city and Macau.\n\nBaidu CEO Robin Li was one of the few speakers to make a passing reference to the protests. In a speech talking about artificial intelligence, he predicted that people could one day use the technology to store their thoughts and have conversations with people from the past.\n\nFormer Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping could be among them, he said. Deng in 1984 and 1987 said if \u201cturmoil\u201d occurs in Hong Kong, \u201cthe central government must intervene\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can also ask Mr. Deng Xiaoping what he thinks of the situation in Hong Kong today,\u201d Li said.\n\n(This story changes \u201ctensions\u201d to \u201ctension\u201d in first paragraph)", "description": "At one of the world's showpiece tech conferences in China, jibes at the United States for its 'bully behavior' lent a Cold War tone to proceedings as trade tension once again reared its ugly head in an event that drew a dearth of top U.S. executives.", "authors": ["Yingzhi Yang", "Josh Horwitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443677995&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0SA-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
