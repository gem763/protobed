Yato had been instrumental in Fiji\u2019s flying start to the match but as he closed in on the try-line after 25 minutes, Hodge swept round to make the tackle.\n\nThe Australia wing appeared to make contact with Yato\u2019s head, and any use of the arms was minimal, but Hodge went unpunished. Yato left the field and failed his head injury assessment, meaning he was unable to return to the pitch.\n\nArgentina heartbreak after Camille Lopez\u2019s drop goal rescues France Read more\n\nJohn McKee, Fiji\u2019s head coach, said afterwards he had not seen a replay of the incident, but added that Yato\u2019s departure was costly for his side. \u201cSome injuries didn\u2019t help us \u2013 especially losing Peceli Yato early on in the game. Losing him to concussion was a big loss for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fiji captain, Dominiko Waqaniburotu, revealed he asked the referee Ben O\u2019Keeffe to consult the TMO, Rowan Kitt, who determined that no further action was required. Fiji were planning on raising the incident with the citing commissioner.\n\nMichael Cheika, Austalia\u2019s head coach, also said he had not seen the Hodge incident, claiming instead that O\u2019Keeffe and his assistants had singled out flanker David Pocock during the match.\n\n\u201cI heard his name mentioned between them on commentary at least half a dozen times in their own chat, when he hadn\u2019t even been involved in the ruck,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the focus on him is because he\u2019s only played one game since he\u2019s been out all year.\u201d\n\nUnder World Rugby\u2019s decision-making framework for high tackles, introduced in May, there is a strong argument that Hodge should have been shown either a yellow or red card, and that Fiji ought to have been awarded a penalty try.\n\nOn the eve of the tournament, World Rugby\u2019s head of referees, Alain Rolland, warned that officials would be more rigorous than ever in policing high tackles but in the opening two matches there has been little evidence of that materialising.\n\nFiji were leading 11-8 at the time of the incident thanks to Yato\u2019s opening try, and while Hodge proceeded to score Australia\u2019s second try before half-time, the Pacific Islanders went into the interval 14-12 ahead. Waisea Nayacalevu seized on a loose ball and ran clear under the posts early in the second half but the Wallabies rallied with tries through Tolu Latu (two), Samu Kerevi and Marika Koroibete to complete their biggest ever World Cup comeback.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Samu Kerevi goes over for an Australia try in Sapporo. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt must be said that Australia\u2019s quality shone through in the final quarter, their set-piece \u2013 both the scrum and the driving maul \u2013 was significantly superior and there is no guarantee the result would have been any different had Yato stayed on the pitch and Hodge been sanctioned.\n\nAt the same time, it left a sour taste in the mouth. All in all, it is simply a great shame that Yato was not able to continue. He emerged from the tunnel but it was clear he was not coming back on when he lay down flat on his back, evidently distraught, by the side of the pitch.\n\nAfter Ben Volavola\u2019s opening penalty, Yato scored a glorious try to put Fiji 8-0 ahead, combining with Josua Tuisova and Nayacalevu down the right after the ball was swiftly moved from the left. Australia were shellshocked \u2014 Levani Botia and Semi Radradra producing some thumping hits and Yato carving through the Wallabies defence.\n\nNew Zealand v South Africa: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 live! Read more\n\nMichael Hooper put Australia on the board with a close-range try but Volavala\u2019s accurate boot kept Fiji in the ascendancy. He continued to do so both after Yato made way, enough to give Fiji a half-time lead despite Hodge\u2019s well-worked try in the right-hand corner.\n\nFiji were given renewed hope when Nayacalevu pounced but ultimately Australia gathered themselves and ground out a lead. Hodge kicked Australia back to within six points and in between Latu\u2019s two tries form close-range driving mauls, Botia was sent to the sin-bin with Fiji\u2019s discipline rapidly deteriorating, the game effectively up.\n\nKerevi and Koroibete \u2013 both of whom were born in Fiji \u2013 added late tries for good measure but the bonus-point victory will be greeted more with relief than any great celebrations, with Wales coming up in their next Pool D match, in Tokyo next Sunday.", "description": "A strong second half from the Wallabies secured victory from a 21-12 deficit but Fiji can feel aggrieved after a high Reece Hodge tackle went unpunished", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7ffbb53879f08a81a766c0c6c4e46c31f26685/98_239_3491_2094/master/3491.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2c203b7dd8c822a478102b8ac7856b0e", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
