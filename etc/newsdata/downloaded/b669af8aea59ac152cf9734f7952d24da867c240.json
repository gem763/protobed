Announced today, the Nest Mini is an upgrade to 2017\u2019s Google Home Mini. The Nest Mini looks nearly identical to the Google Home Mini, except it comes with improved speakers and an included wall mount. It\u2019ll come in four colors: black, light gray, coral, and light blue.\n\nGoogle\u2019s particularly marketing the Nest Mini as an audio device. The company says the bass is twice as strong as the original Google Home Mini for more natural sound. If you\u2019re listening to audio content, the speaker will light up when you place your hand close to the device for volume adjustment. It can also pair with other Nest speakers to create a larger sound system. This means people can make Google Duo calls through the Google Home app or use other Nest speakers as intercoms.\n\nThe company says the Nest Mini also now includes a third microphone that\u2019ll help in noisy environments, and it features dedicated machine learning that allows Google Assistant features to run faster and on the device itself.\n\nIt\u2019ll cost $49, and the preorder is live today. It goes on sale on October 22nd and will be available in 23 countries. Retailers include Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.\n\nSky's out, Mini is up. The new #NestMini comes with a wall mount, giving you have more flexibility to choose where it goes in your home. And we added a new color (inspired by Lake Como ) to blend in with your decor\u2014Sky. #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/s0yov4JKD7 \u2014 Google (@Google) October 15, 2019\n\nDeveloping.
