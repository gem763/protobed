It's absolutely a given that they will come back,\" Mattis had said.\n\nThat's apparently when Trump cut Schumer off and called Mattis overrated.\n\n\"You know why?\" Trump said. \"He wasn\u2019t tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\"\n\nOn Thursday night, Mattis also said that being called \"overrated\" by Trump didn\u2019t bother him because he earned his \u201cspurs on the battlefield\u201d and Trump \u201cearned his spurs in a letter from a doctor,\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s medical deferments from serving in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs.\n\n\u201cI do stand before you, as was noted here, really having achieved greatness.
