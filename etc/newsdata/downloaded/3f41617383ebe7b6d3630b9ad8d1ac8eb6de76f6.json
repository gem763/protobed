You could hear them stomping on the ground,\u201d she said.\n\nWednesday\u2019s TV appearance followed the band\u2019s debut performance for 5,000 fans Saturday at Capitol Records in Los Angeles, where they also launched the music video for \u201cJopping.\u201d\n\nThe K-pop all-star ensemble seemed relaxed and comfortable with each other during multiple promotion events, including a showcase and press conference, where they spoke to reporters about performing with others they had idolized.\n\n\u201cWhen I was younger, I\u2019d watch these older members perform, and I grew up watching them. So what a great honor for me to be a part of them,\u201d Taeyong said via a translator.\n\nMark shared an anecdote about talking to Kai earlier in the day about how awkward it was for him to even touch the EXO member during the album jacket shoot. Now they are much closer.\n\nTen called it a \u201cdream come true\u201d to work with Taemin.\n\nSuperM is the latest unit under SM Entertainment\u2019s SMP, SM Music Performance, which have been one-off projects by the company with an emphasis on dance.\n\nTen\u2019s \u201cDream in a Dream\u201d from 2017 falls under this category, as did \u201cSpectrum\u201d from 2012, which featured Kai and Taemin as the youngest in the group with their seniors from Super Junior and TVXQ.\n\nNow the senior members themselves, SuperM set out to become the top K-pop figure on the international stage by focusing on high-impact performances and featuring a lineup of ace members from each group.\n\n\u201cWe wish to be pioneers of K-pop,\u201d Baekhyun said during the press conference in English, with fans cheering his use of the language. \u201cWe will bring K-pop to the next level.\u201d\n\nThe collaboration with Capitol Music Group is one of the biggest K-pop projects between South Korean and American music labels.\n\nThe group\u2019s formation was controversial among fans of the groups starting a trending hashtag, #SuperGroupDisbandParty, on Twitter, expressing concerns about the performers\u2019 hectic schedules. Fans said they\u2019d rather see solo work than a new supergroup.\n\nSuperM members reassured fans they wouldn\u2019t be leaving their original groups.\n\nFans in L.A. didn\u2019t seem fazed, wearing the official SuperM AR T-shirts that came alive with the help of an app or homemade gear like headbands with the members\u2019 names.\n\nOne of the loudest fans in the front row was Lee Soo Man, founder of SM Entertainment and the mastermind behind SuperM.\n\nJanae Lowary, 21, an NCT fan, drove from San Diego for the performance. Wearing a headband that said Kai in Korean \u2014 her favorite EXO member \u2014 she dismissed the initial criticism of the group.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a genius idea to put all these aces [together]. They\u2019re aces in their respective groups and you put them all together and it\u2019s like \u2014 you saw the turnout! The turnout is insane,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really optimistic for what they\u2019re gonna do in the future. Because this is their first time performing as a whole, and if it\u2019s this good now, imagine how good it\u2019s gonna be in six months when they have another comeback. I feel like it\u2019s something that\u2019s gonna be really big. Not only just for K-pop, but music as a whole.\u201d\n\nWearing a superhero-like red cape with the SuperM logo and the members\u2019 names painted on, 17-year-old Jae Shapia flew in from Las Vegas only to learn the ticket she bought was a fake. Someone on Twitter gifted her a real one and she was able to see her favorite member, Taeyong. Though a fan of NCT 127, Taeyong and Mark\u2019s resident group, Shapia acknowledges some apprehension for the new group.\n\n\u201cAt first I was like, \u2018This is going to be awful for their stamina and their self-esteem and they\u2019re just gonna be tired all the time,\u2019\u201d she said, explaining that SuperM\u2019s upcoming North America tour will collide with NCT 127\u2019s tour in Japan. \u201cBut seeing them out there and seeing how happy they were, they looked pretty proud about it, so I feel a bit better that they look ok and that they\u2019re happy and enjoying the group.\u201d\n\nSuperM\u2019s North American arena tour runs November through February. Though only 10 dates have been announced, the tour poster suggests more will be added.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 K-pop supergroup SuperM added a Wednesday performance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to their energetic American debut.
