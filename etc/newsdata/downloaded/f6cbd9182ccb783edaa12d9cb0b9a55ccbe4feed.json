Sign up here.\n\nAmber Guyger, the former Dallas cop convicted of killing her neighbor in his own apartment, has taken a key step toward appealing her conviction.\n\nHer appellate attorney filed a notice of appeal last week for both her murder conviction and her 10-year sentence. The notice does not necessarily mean Guyger will actually appeal. But filing it was a necessary step to keep that option open, since Texas rules require a defendant file a notice of appeal within 30 days after a sentence is imposed or suspended in court.\n\n\u201cMy sense is it will be months before any formal appeal, if a formal appeal is filed,\u201d Robert Rogers, the lead trial attorney for Guyger, told VICE News Wednesday.\n\nREAD: \"Not racist but ...\": Ex-Dallas cop Amber Guyger sent sketchy texts months before murdering unarmed black man\n\nGuyger, 31, was convicted of murdering her 26-year-old neighbor Botham Jean earlier this month. Guyger claimed she had entered Jean\u2019s apartment by mistake after a long shift, then proceeded to shoot him dead as he watched TV while eating ice cream.\n\nHer attorneys argued \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws applied, since Guyger said she thought she was in her apartment, which was on an entirely different floor.\n\nDuring the trial, Guyger apologized for killing Jean and said she wished she was the one who died that day in September 2018.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d Guyger said. \u201cThis is not about hate. It\u2019s about being scared that night.\u201d\n\nWhen Guyger appeared in court for her sentencing earlier this month, Jean\u2019s brother approached the former cop and hugged his brother\u2019s killer. The moment of forgiveness went viral.\n\nAt her trial, the judge also hugged Guyger and gave her a Bible, after Guyger received her sentence of 10 years in prison. But now its possible she\u2019ll try to undo that sentence.\n\nRogers said he would not be involved in the appeal process but that Guyger\u2019s team would have to take time to decide whether it was the correct move.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to file a frivolous appeal, you have to assess whether there is a viable appeal,\u201d he said.\n\nCover: In this Friday, Sept. 27, 2019, file pool photo, fired Dallas police officer Amber Guyger becomes emotional as she testifies in her murder trial in Dallas.
