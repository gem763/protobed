Lawmakers also voted to recognize the Armenian genocide of a century ago.\n\nWhile the latter move has no direct financial implication, Turkey has been resisting such findings for years, and the adverse diplomatic development may add to the impact on investor morale.\n\nAfter the vote, the Turkish lira sold off by as much as 0.33%, on top of yesterday\u2019s 0.36% advance. At 3:00 EDT, however, the currency plunged 0.36% within a single hour. No known fundamentals have been publicized. Therefore, it is likely to be on profit taking. Technically, however, we expect the lira to continue weakening.\n\nUSD/TRY Daily Chart\n\nThe lira strengthened 21% between the late-January trough and the May high. The last peak must be bested to extend the long-term uptrend, but the USD/TRY has established a medium uptrend in the meanwhile.\n\nThe pair has registered two troughs and two peaks between the August low and the October high. The trading formed a rising channel, whose lower line marks the levels where demand kicks in, while the upper line tracks the levels where they take profit.\n\nWhile today\u2019s decline may have found resistance by the 50 DMA, the price demonstrated support in the last week of trading above the 100 DMA, after bouncing off the 200 DMA in forming the second trough on Sept. 30.\n\nThe RSI has reached a support level since early September, corresponding to the price range during that period. A break below would complete a double top in the momentum-based indicator, applying pressure to the price, but a rebound above 50 would signal a continued uptrend within the rising channel.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders would wait to enter a long position after closing above the 5.8 level, having climbed above the Oct. 25 high, as demand absorbs all available supply at these levels. Then, they\u2019d wait for a pullback to prove support by the uptrend line.\n\nModerate traders may enter a long position after registering a higher high in the short-term, above 5.8, then wait for a return move, for a better entry, not necessarily for evidence of a continued medium-term uptrend.\n\nAggressive traders may risk a long position now, relying on the established medium uptrend within the long-term uptrend, the bottom of the rising channel, above the 200 DMA \u2013 with the vote for sanctions presumably scaring off investors.\n\nTrade Sample\n\nEntry: 5.7440\n\nStop-Loss: 5.7140 \u2013 below the Oct. 28 low\n\nRisk: 300 pips\n\nTarget: 5.8340\n\nReward: 900 pips\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio 1:3", "description": "Forex Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: USD/TRY.
