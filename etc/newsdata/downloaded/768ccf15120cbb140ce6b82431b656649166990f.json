The transmission cable, which could come online in 2027-28, would also unlock highly cost-effective wind power, fed by the famous Roaring Forties, currently lying untapped because of constraints in the existing Basslink interconnector.\n\nMr Balcombe said the Tasmanian project would work \"in concert\" with the 2000 MW Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project currently under development.\n\n\"Our perspective is that there is room for both,\" he said, pointing to estimates that about 12,000 MW of coal-fired generation would retire by 2035, needing to be replaced by about 40,000 MW wind and solar, complemented by about 8000 MW of dispatchable generation.", "description": "A second interconnector between Tasmania and Victoria would open up a bank of clean green energy and storage for the National Electricity Market but funding hurdles need to be overcome.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_46/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/fcf2870f72e43215b823f156ce6a864d95fee536", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
