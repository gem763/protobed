When I ate, I felt good, it gave me comfort and happiness.\n\n'I lived my entire life being morbidly obese and one hundred per cent dependent on that good feeling I got from food. I felt like food was the only thing there for me and never let me down.'\n\nShe added: 'Before I lost weight, I felt awful about myself. I felt ashamed, embarrassed, and completely trapped in my body. I had given up and just came to terms that this was how my life was supposed to be.\n\n'But I decided to make a drastic change and take control of my health. I have two kids who need me - and they need all of me, not just a shell of a mother.'\n\nAngela dropped to 154lbs after losing half her 308lbs weight, and now Angela's self-confidence has grown\n\nAt her heaviest, Angela (pictured after first having her excess skin removal procedure) felt miserable in her body and was constantly ashamed of how she looked\n\nSince losing weight, Angela enjoys running around with her children in the park - something she never believed would be possible.\n\nAngela said that her frame may never look 'perfect', but she has so much appreciation for what her body has been through.\n\n'I was a stay-at-home mother for a few years but then I got a job with great health benefits. I used those medical benefits to have weight loss surgery and it forever changed my life,' said Angela.\n\nSpeaking about her unhealthy food habits, the mother admitted: 'My diet before weight loss surgery was McDonald's drive thru on my way home from work and everything from the freezer section in the supermarket.\n\n'Now when me and my family go grocery shopping, we spend most of our time shopping the fresh produce, meat and dairy.\n\nAngela (pictured prior to her excess skin removal surgery) said losing weight has 'completely changed' her life for both herself and her family\n\nAngela said that her frame may never look 'perfect', but she has so much appreciation for what her body has been through\n\n'Now I do my best to try to only eat whole foods and limit how much processed food I eat. I am far from perfect and sometimes I indulge, but I no longer eat to comfort my feelings.\n\nShe added: 'I drink almost no sugary drinks anymore, mostly sticking to water or black coffee. I make it a point to drink no less than two liters of water a day, whereas before I would be lucky to get that much water in a week.'\n\nAngela, who can even shop in the teens clothing section now, said losing weight has 'completely changed' her life for both herself and her family because she now has more energy to spend time with them.\n\nShe continued: 'I can fit on rides and fully enjoy being out with my boys. I'm no longer the mother sitting on the side watching them.\n\n'I finally love my body and my flaws. I have never been so at peace with myself than I am now.\n\n'People are genuinely shocked at how much weight I've lost. They are so happy for me and I have some great support.'", "description": "Angela Gerzanics, 35, from Michigan,\u00a0halved her 308lbs frame - going from a size 30 to a size 10 - after undergoing\u00a0gastric band surgery in 2016 and kicking her unhealthy habits.", "authors": ["Jessica Green For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/19531464-0-image-a-2_1570699096292.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
