The Republican said, among other things, that he kisses women he considers attractive \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t even wait,\u201d Trump claimed at the time \u2013 which he said he can get away with because of his public profile.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,\u201d Trump said on the recording. \u201cYou can do anything. Grab \u2018em by the p\u2014y.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump denied having done what he bragged about doing, more than a few women came forward to accuse the Republican of sexual misconduct \u2013 one of whom, Summer Zervos, is currently suing the president for defamation, after Trump insisted each of his accusers were liars.\n\nTrump and his lawyers have spent months trying to make the case go away, insisting that a sitting president is immune to civil suits in state courts. As regular readers know, their efforts have come up short and the case is ongoing.\n\nThe Washington Post reported overnight on the latest revelations from the case.\n\nExcerpts of President Trump\u2019s private calendar from a dozen years ago made public on Thursday appear to show Trump was at a Beverly Hills hotel around the same time a former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant alleges he assaulted her there. Email exchanges from 2007 also released Thursday show that the woman, Summer Zervos, had sought a lunch meeting with Trump in New York around the time she claims he kissed her inappropriately in that city. The calendar records and email correspondence came to light in court filings related to Zervos\u2019s ongoing defamation lawsuit against Trump in New York State Court.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing, insisting he never met Zervos at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The president\u2019s lawyer in this case, Marc Kasowitz, told the Associated Press yesterday that Zervos\u2019s claims are \u201centirely meritless and not corroborated by any documents.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the latest details emerged as part of the discovery process in this case, and that process is ongoing. That\u2019s of interest for reasons that relate directly to the defamation suit, of course, but there may be related implications.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed before, Zervos\u2019 representatives have raised the prospect of seeking, among other things, documents from the Trump Organization about the president\u2019s alleged mistreatment of other women, as well as recordings from the archives of the president\u2019s former reality show.\n\nThe Post\u2019s report added that a judge has set a Dec. 6 deadline for depositions, \u201cmeaning Trump may have to make a statement or answer questions under oath.\u201d\n\nThat may be right around the time of the president\u2019s impeachment in an unrelated scandal.", "description": "As if Donald Trump weren't already at the center of several scandals, new details are emerging in the defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap_18156003038758.jpg?itok=nw4tBiX2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
