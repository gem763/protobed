It has resisted calls for a stimulus package to reverse the slowdown, saying the economy is not facing a crisis.\n\nEconomists say the forecasts do not factor in a possible escalation in the trade conflict between the United States and the EU and are based on the scenario that Britain will leave the bloc in an orderly manner.\n\nIf any of those risks becomes reality, the outlook for Germany would be grimmer, they say.", "description": "Employment in Germany's private sector fell for the first time in six years in October, a survey showed on Thursday, suggesting that a third-quarter slowdown in Europe's largest economy could stretch into the closing months of the year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
