This presents a new stumbling block for Libra's efforts to convince regulators and politicians about the coin's safety.\n\nFrance pledged last month to block Libra from operating in Europe, while the Bank of England laid out high hurdles it must meet before its launch. United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has also suggested the project could not advance before concerns were assuaged.\n\nLibra, announced as Facebook expands into e-commerce, will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and overseen by the Libra Association.\n\nThe structure is intended to foster trust and stabilise the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.", "description": "Exodus of major financial players raises bar for Libra to convince regulators and consumers of coin's safety.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/22/e6ba7c66313b465d9b6e3567ac49a531_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
