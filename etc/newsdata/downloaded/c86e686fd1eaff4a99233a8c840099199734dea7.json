Will this help me get salvation? \u2014 Rakesh Tomar, 48 years\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Habits develop slowly, through months of practice. By doing the same action again and again, a habit, good or bad, gradually becomes a necessity. It is rightly said that habit is a good servant but a bad master. If we let the habit control us, it becomes our master and we follow it like a loyal servant. A habit is doing things unconsciously. Therefore, we do things out of force of habit. Don\u2019t let habits inhibit you, be their master and keep them under control and enjoy the good they may do for you.\n\n\n\nVisiting a temple is good if you are not going just because it has become a habit; rather go there as a conscious seeker, then your visit will help purify your mind. When we enter the temple, we feel positivity inside us. We are at peace.\n\n\n\nSamskaras are formed out of our habits, when thoughts and actions leave impressions on the mind; though our repetitive behaviour also forms new samskaras and the cycle continues.\n\nBe conscious and aware of what you are doing, to discontinue the karmic process.\n\n\n\nOne can get rid of karma only by releasing it and this requires awareness in daily life. It will not bind you, and will help you on the path to salvation.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.speakingtree.in/a/749770-1350-420-5/be-conscious-749770.img", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
