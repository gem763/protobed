This is much in the vein of the summer of 2019, when New York struck out on several big-name free agents after clearly angling for Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving by trading Kristaps Porzingis in January.\n\nOf course, both Durant and Irving chose the Brooklyn Nets, and so the Knicks will have to watch their crosstown rivals climb up the ranks in the Eastern Conference.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMeanwhile, a source inside that Knicks says the organization was stunned when Durant and Irving chose Brooklyn over Manhattan.\n\nVia Frank Isola:\n\nWhile the Knicks have spun this notion that they didn\u2019t want meetings with either player \u2014 as well as Kawhi Leonard \u2014 a team source insists that management was \u201cstunned and depressed\u201d when they learned that Irving and Durant picked the other team in town.\n\nThis is sort of surprising\u2026 or perhaps it isn\u2019t? New York hasn\u2019t been a well-run organization for some time, and why any superstar would choose the Knicks at this point simply because of location is lacking in self-awareness. \u201cBig names go to big markets\u201d is a thinking that is at least a decade old. Stars still gravitate to big markets, but usually only to teams that have adequate management. Just ask the Los Angeles Lakers how having one and not the other is working out for them.\n\nWho knows if New York will ever get the big-name stars they desire through the open market. Meanwhile, they will just have to make do with potential Rookie of the Year candidate RJ Barrett.", "description": "Thinking superstars will choose the Knicks simply because of location is lacking in self-awareness.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5VrI8oIpfu1npd.Cc2bJ_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjAuMDkzNTY3MjUxNDYy/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uf7ji66_HsWLeszLzQW_gw--~B/aD00ODE7dz04NTU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/d665f9294fb0937e636a124073c40c64", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
