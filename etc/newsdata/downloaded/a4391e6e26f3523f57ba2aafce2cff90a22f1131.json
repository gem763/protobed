(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Trump administration released a sweeping plan Thursday that could remake the U.S. housing market, starting with ending more than a decade of government control of two massive companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that back half of the nation\u2019s mortgages.\n\nThe long-awaited plan from the Treasury Department features nearly 50 proposals, including many technical changes to financial regulations, and is aimed at shrinking the government\u2019s role in the housing market. The cornerstone of the plan would resolve the fates of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, which 11 years ago this week were put into government conservatorship during the global financial crisis.\n\nThe proposals will \u201cprotect taxpayers and help Americans who want to buy a home,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. \u201cAn effective and efficient federal housing finance system will also meaningfully contribute to the continued economic growth under this administration.\u201d\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a critical part in the housing market, buying mortgages from lenders, then packaging them into securities to sell to investors. The government seized control of both companies in 2008 as the housing market unraveled and the firms\u2019 losses piled up.\n\n[Republicans want mortgage giants Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac to be private companies again]\n\nThe housing giants back half of the United States\u2019 mortgages, and housing experts have warned that allowing them too much freedom again could lead to higher mortgage costs for consumers while enriching Wall Street investors.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s housing plan will make mortgages more expensive and harder to get. I\u2019m urging the president: Make it easier for working people to buy or rent their homes, not harder,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac represent the last major unresolved business from the financial crisis, and Mnuchin has called them a top priority for more than two years. Under the plan, they would be turned back into private companies but would be required to pay taxpayers a fee for government protection. It would also open the market up to competitors for the first time.\n\nWhile Democrats and Republicans support ending government control of the companies, several other plans have stalled in Congress. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration shied away from the topic, fearful that a wrong move could disrupt the housing market and the availability of 30-year mortgages.\n\nA senior Treasury Department official said that while the administration\u2019s plan was extensive, the changes are designed to be \u201cincremental and realistic.\u201d\n\n[Read the Trump administration's plan to overhaul the housing market]\n\nThe issue is being closely watched by housing advocates as well as the banking and housing industries \u2014 all of which have developed their own competing proposals on what should be done with the companies. Several Wall Street hedge funds also invested heavily in the companies\u2019 stock and bet that the Trump administration\u2019s efforts may clear the path for them to secure significant profits.\n\nThis comes at a time when many U.S. home buyers are already struggling to find affordable homes. Prices have been rising for years, and there are not enough moderately priced homes for sale, according to National Association of Realtors data.\n\nMost of the Trump administration\u2019s proposals require action by Congress, but the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could take some actions on its own. The agency is run by Mark Calabria, formerly Vice President Pence\u2019s chief economist.\n\n[How Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dodged a $600,000 cap on CEO pay]\n\nCalabria, without congressional approval, could end the government conservatorship of the companies and do away with a requirement that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac send most of their profits to the Treasury Department, for example.\n\n\u201cIt is, after 11 years, time to bring the conservatorships to an end,\u201d the proposal says. \u201cEnding the conservatorships is a critical step to reducing that government influence\u201d on the housing market.\n\nThe plan leaves many questions unresolved, including what would happen to the thousands of shares of Fannie and Freddie stock owned by the government.\n\nThe reports are comprehensive but leave it to Congress and regulators to figure out many of the details, said Guy Cecala, the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. \u201cLike a lot of things, the devil is in the details,\u201d he said.\n\nIt could take years for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to build up enough capital to be sustainable as private companies again, Cecala said. And it would require the Treasury Department to forgo billions a year in profits from the companies that currently flow into government coffers. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven our deficit, I would be reluctant to do it.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, Fannie Mae has received $119.8 billion in taxpayer bailouts, with Freddie Mac receiving $71.6 billion. But as they returned to profitability, the companies have sent a combined $300 billion in dividends to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s plan attempts to reduce the government\u2019s influence on the housing market by shrinking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s roles. It also calls for a smaller role for the Federal Housing Administration, which currently backs about 15 percent of home purchases.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac would pay taxpayers a fee in return for a government guarantee in case they fall into financial trouble again. But taxpayers would be forced to bail out the companies again only in \u201cexigent circumstances,\u201d according to the 53-page proposal.\n\nThe proposals also include several measures that target affordable housing. One administrative change urges the FHFA to \u201crevisit \u2026 underwriting criteria\u201d for loans on multifamily properties where rent control laws \u201cor other undue impediments to housing development\u201d are in place.\n\nThe housing agency should also take administrative action to come up with \u201cmore efficient mechanisms\u201d for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to achieve required affordable-housing goals, the proposal states. And the document calls on Congress to pass new laws that would replace statutory affordable-housing goals \u201cwith a more efficient, transparent and accountable mechanism for delivering tailored support\u201d to lower-income, rural and first-time home buyers.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development released a separate report that calls for the Federal Housing Administration, which backs loans to low-income and first-time home buyers, to \u201crefocus\u201d on its core mission. FHA-backed loans have gotten bigger and riskier since the financial crisis, the HUD report says. Homeowners are also increasingly using the program for cash-out refinance deals, the report says.\n\nThose trends should be monitored and Congress should limit homeowners ability to use the FHA to strip equity from their homes, the report recommends.\n\nHUD also calls for the FHA to help companies that participate in their programs avoid hefty fines for trivial issues, which the agency says has pushed some lenders out of the market. Lenders have complained about \u201cminor errors leading to exposure to severe financial penalties,\u201d the report says. Congress could also allow HUD to issue shorter suspensions for minor infractions, the report says.", "description": "The plan would end federal control of housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which back half of the United States' mortgages.
