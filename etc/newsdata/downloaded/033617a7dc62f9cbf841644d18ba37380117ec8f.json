USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred was careful in his words Wednesday, but it was clear he was agitated by the Houston Astros\u2019 actions, and embarrassed by assistant GM Brandon Taubman\u2019s expletive-filled tirade towards a group of female reporters.\n\nMLB has launched an official investigation into the matter Wednesday, interviewing Taubman, Astros\u2019 staffers and the three reporters who overheard the tirade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really concerned at this point about the underlying substance of the situation,\u2019\u2019 Manfred said, \u201cand what the atmosphere was, how it came to be. That\u2019s my focus right now.\n\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on providing an inclusive, harassment-free environment in all the various aspects of our business. I think it\u2019s a core value for baseball and I think we have to be tremendously concerned when we have an incident that attracts this much attention.\u2019\u2019\n\nTaubman, celebrating the Astros\u2019 American League pennant-clinching Game 6 on Saturday, yelled: \u201cThank God we got (Roberto) Osuna! I\u2019m so (expletive) glad we got Osuna!\u201d towards the three reporters who were standing in the team\u2019s clubhouse.\n\nOsuna was acquired in July 2018 while he was serving a 75-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball\u2019s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse policy.\n\nOsuna, who was arrested in Toronto for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, and the mother of their 3-year-old son, accepted his suspension without appeal. The charges were withdrawn last September when Osuna entered into a peace bond in Canadian court.\n\nTaubman, who has refused to comment on the incident, issued a statement that read: \u201cI used inappropriate language for which I am deeply sorry and embarrassed. In retrospect, I realize that my comments were unprofessional and inappropriate. My overexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue.\u201d\n\nASTROS: Fans grapple with 'tasteless' remark, specter of domestic violence\n\nMORE MLB: League investigating umpire's tweets\n\nAstros GM Jeff Luhnow has also declined comment, save for answering one question in an appearance on the team\u2019s flagship radio station \u2013 and has not made himself available to reporters.\n\n\u201cWhat we really don\u2019t know is the intent behind the inappropriate comments he made,\u2019\u2019 Luhnow told SportsTalk790. \u201cWe may never know that because the person who said them and the people who heard them, at least up to this point, have different perspectives.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe only member of the organization who has publicly commented to reporters is Astros manager A.J. Hinch, who has addressed the issue the past two days, despite not witnessing the incident.\n\n\u201cFor me, I feel responsible for the clubhouse,\u2019\u2019 Hinch said Wednesday. \u201cI feel responsible for everything that goes on down here. I consider myself a leader. I cherish this place. I cherish our players and everything that goes on. I was just being the manager of the club here down here in the clubhouse. \u2026\n\n\u201cNo one, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a player, a coach, a manager, any of you members of the media, should ever feel like when you come into our clubhouse that you\u2019re going to be uncomfortable or disrespected.\u201d\n\nManfred won\u2019t know whether Taubman\u2019s actions will warrant discipline until MLB officials complete their investigation, but they were not consulted when the Astros put out a statement calling the story \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible\u201d and saying it was an \u201cattempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be a conversation with the club at the end of the investigation,\u2019\u2019 Manfred said, \u201cand as often the case, we\u2019ll make a decision working with the club as to how, who should handle it. At the end of the day, he is an Astros employee.\n\n\u201cIn general, it is my view that you want to get all the facts, want to be as thorough as you possibly can, understand what the whole situation (is). Once you get there, you want to get it all behind you.\u2019\u2019\n\nManfred speaks to reporters prior to Game 2 of the World Series. (Photo: David J. Phillip, AP)\n\nManfred, who met with a small group of reporters after the Hank Aaron Award press conference before Game 2, also addressed the notion that MLB is using different baseballs than the regular season.\n\nBaseballs have traveled significantly less this postseason, according to research by Baseball Prospectus, and supported by St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt, who said that their analytics team discovered that baseballs were traveling 4 \u00bd-feet less than the regular season.\n\nThere\u2019s a 6% decrease in homers hit per game, 2.61, compared to the record-setting rate of 2.78 in the regular season. Curiously, the ball traveled further in the 2017 postseason, with a home-run increase of 12% from the regular season to 2.82 homers per game, the first season players strongly believed the ball was juiced.\n\n\u201cI can tell you one thing for very certain, just like every other year,\u2019\u2019 Manfred said, \u201cthe balls we used in this postseason were selected from lots that were used in the regular season.\n\n\u201cThere is no difference in those baseballs.\u2019\u2019\n\nYet, when you talk to players and coaches this postseason, and they\u2019re convinced there\u2019s a dramatic difference.\n\n\u201cWe try to be really disciplined about this,\u2019\u2019 Manfred said. \u201cI think an analysis based on large sample sizes \u2013 meaning season-long samples \u2013 is really the most reliable research. We\u2019re going to have that report from scientists.\n\n\u201cJust remember, you\u2019re backing into a drag number, and when you have a large sample, variables like weather and who\u2019s pitching, that all washes out in a very large sample. When you start picking three days in the postseason when the weather\u2019s different and you have the very best pitching in the game, it becomes less reliable.\u2019\u2019\n\nManfred also said that no decision has been made on a reported proposal that MLB wants to eliminate 25% of the minor league teams, dropping the total number from 160 to about 120, in hopes of prioritizing the upgrading of minor league facilities.\n\n\u201cWe had three preliminary meetings and then a round in the press that was pretty clearly orchestrated,\u2019\u2019 Manfred said. \u201cSome of what\u2019s been out there is inaccurate.\n\n\u201cI think the important points of this, there\u2019s an economic system in minor league baseball where we heavily subsidize what goes on in minor league baseball. We are more than prepared to continue to do that. Against that backdrop, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable of us to expect that we have facilities that are first-class for some of the greatest athletes in the world, that we have league alignments that are reasonable and not onerous for those same athletes.\n\n\u201cI think over the long haul, minor league baseball will be at the table and prepared to discuss those things. I see this as a momentary interlude.\u2019\u2019\n\nManfred shrugged off the idea that losing minor-league baseball in small markets could possibly hurt MLB.\n\n\u201cWe agree that minor league baseball is an entr\u00e9e into fandom,\u2019\u2019 Manfred said. \u201cIf you look at the discussions we had, many of those franchises average less than 2,000 people a game. They\u2019re not really major drivers of attendance in the minor leagues.\n\n\u201cOur preference was never to reduce numbers. It was to get to first-rate facilities. If we can\u2019t get to first-rate facilities, I\u2019m not sure it makes sense for us to send people to play in facilities that are inadequate, and continue to subsidize those inadequate facilities.\"", "description": "MLB has launched an official investigation into the matter Wednesday, interviewing Taubman, Astros\u2019 staffers and the three reporters who overheard the tirade.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
