By comparison, a mere 12 NSC policy staffers helped President John F. Kennedy deal with the Cuban missile crisis in 1962,\u201d O\u2019Brien wrote. \u201cWith the president\u2019s approval, we will reduce the NSC staff, making it more effective by reaffirming its mission to coordinate policy and ensure policy implementation. The NSC staff should not, as it has in the past, duplicate the work of military officers, diplomats or intelligence officers.\u201d\n\nIn order to trim the fat, the NSA will consolidate duplicative roles with other agencies and eliminate current vacancies.\n\nO\u2019Brien said his goal is to bring the agency back to its historical mission of advising the president on matters relating to national security, in alignment with the president\u2019s push for a \u201clean, efficient government.\u201d\n\nFormer National Security Adviser John Bolton exited the post in September, saying he resigned on his own accord. President Trump at the time, however, said he had informed Bolton that his services were \u201cno longer needed at the White House\u201d and asked him for his resignation.\n\nAbout a week later, Trump named O\u2019Brien as Bolton\u2019s replacement. O\u2019Brien was instrumental in helping secure the release of rapper A$AP Rocky from Swedish prison earlier this year.\n\nWhile Bolton and Trump are said to have had significant disagreements, O\u2019Brien touted the administration\u2019s accomplishments, including walking away from the nuclear deal with Iran, battling back the Islamic State, \u201cusing a firm hand with Moscow,\u201d and exerting pressure on North Korea.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Robert O\u2019Brien said his goal is to bring the agency back to its historical mission of advising the president.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Robert-OBrien.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
