Gruden became the fifth coach to be dismissed under owner Dan Snyder, and, after an 0-5 start, most people understood why.\n\nInstead, Mr. Allen was asked, repeatedly, to explain his own shortcomings, as well as the failures of the organization he has run since 2009.\n\nUnder Mr. Allen, the Redskins are 59-89-1 with only two playoff appearances in that span. Under Snyder, the Redskins are 139-185-1 the last 20 years.\n\nBut the son of George Allen, the iconic Redskins coach of the 1970s, dismissed questions about deep-rooted dysfunction and mismanagement, insisting that the franchise is close to a turnaround.\n\n\u201cThe culture is actually damn good,\u201d the team president told reporters. \u201cThese people care. We have a very young core of players that we have brought in here who are accustomed to winning. If you look at the record of these guys they\u2019re accustomed to winning. They want to win.\u201d\n\nJust five games into the schedule, 2019 already seems to encapsulate a little of everything that has gone wrong for the franchise over the past 20 years. From being demolished on the field to being embarrassed off, the Redskins are clearly among the NFL\u2019s dregs, with no easy fix in sight.\n\nAllen said the Redskins will wait until after the season before seeking a permanent replacement for Gruden. On Monday, Washington named Bill Callahan as the interim, promoting him from offensive line coach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no magic formula,\u201d said Callahan, who hasn\u2019t been a head coach in the NFL since his time with the Oakland Raiders in 2003.\n\nAfter firing Gruden, Snyder will look to hire his seventh head coach, or ninth if you include interims. Washington hasn\u2019t made an in-season coaching change since 2000, when Snyder dismissed Norv Turner and named Terry Robiskie as the interim.\n\nAllen has long been a target of scorn from fans, many of whom argued on social media and on sports talk radio that the owner\u2019s right-hand man should have been sent packing along with the coach.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s loss, one person was seen holding a banner that read \u201cFIRE BRUCE ALLEN\u201d and stood behind NBC Sports Washington\u2019s postgame show at FedEx Field \u2014 before security promptly confiscated the sign. Others have tweeted hashtags calling for Allen\u2019s job, while some have even bought shirts that demanded a change.\n\nAsked why fans should have any confidence in Allen\u2019s and Snyder\u2019s leadership of the franchise, Allen said it was a \u201cfair question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to hide from our record,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hide from things that didn\u2019t go the way we wanted them to go. All we can do is work. And do I believe in the group that\u2019s here? Yes. \u2026 I\u2019m not saying I care more than anyone, but I absolutely want what\u2019s best for the Washington Redskins and we\u2019re going to make sure we do it.\u201d\n\nThe lead-up to Gruden\u2019s firing shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. The 52-year-old was on rocky footing from the moment the Redskins waited weeks after last season to inform him that he would return for a sixth season. In May, he joked that if he didn\u2019t make the playoffs in 2019, he\u2019d be fired.\n\nMeeting with reporters this offseason, Allen justified keeping Gruden and the coaching staff because he felt the team was \u201cclose\u201d to playoff contention. That status quo, however, turned out to be a mistake.\n\nThe Redskins\u2018 season quickly fell apart, starting in the offseason with left tackle Trent Williams\u2019 holdout. Allen noted how the Redskins\u2018 five losses \u201cweren\u2019t close.\u201d Injuries, too, became a factor as the Redskins were without players like the talented but brittle tight end Jordan Reed and offensive line slawart Brandon Scherff.\n\nGruden\u2019s firing was greeted skeptically \u2014 even derisively \u2014 by players and media around the league.\n\nFormer NFL general manager Michael Lombardi said the move was akin to \u201cthrowing deck chairs off the Titanic\u201d in a radio interview on 106.7 The Fan. Former quarterback Sage Rosenfels tweeted \u201cone of the luckiest things that happened to me was being traded away from the Redskins.\u201d\n\nWhoever Snyder chooses to be the next coach, the person will likely be expected to oversee the development of Dwayne Haskins. Callahan said the first-rounder won\u2019t be a contender to start Sunday against the Miami Dolphins, but many in the organization, including Mr. Allen, have said the rookie quarterback is a key to the franchise\u2019s future.\n\nAllen did not reveal, nor was he asked, what qualities he was looking for in a future head coach. But in Snyder\u2019s tenure, the Redskins have tried all types: the hot college coach (Steve Spurrier), the well-respected NFL legend (Mike Shanahan) and a young, offensive guru (Gruden).\n\nNone of it has worked consistently.\n\n\u201cThe pieces are here for a winning team,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe have to put them in the right place, believe in each other, and keep fighting for our goal. There\u2019s only one way you win. You have to work. You have to get better and you have to beat your opponent. And that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
