But don\u2019t rest on your laurels \u2013 there are always new goals and fresh challenges. You are up and running, now keep going. CALL 0904 470 1168 (65p per minute)*\n\nSagittarius 23 NOV-21 DEC You\u2019ve reached a major turning point in your year, maybe your life. A New Moon in Scorpio followed by Venus\u2019s move into your sign means everything you don\u2019t want will vanish from your existence. Everything you do want will soon be yours. CALL 0904 470 1169 (65p per minute)*\n\nCapricorn 22 DEC-20 JAN Don\u2019t shut yourself away, even if you secretly fear letting others know how vulnerable you feel. The more you radiate friendship and warmth, the more you\u2019ll attract people who can in some way lighten your load or further your ambitions. CALL 0904 470 1170 (65p per minute)*\n\nAquarius 21 JAN-19 FEB Although yours is an Air sign and intellectual by nature, this week\u2019s New Moon could see you reacting emotionally and illogically to something less important than you believe. It will pay to postpone an important financial decision. CALL 0904 470 1171 (65p per minute)*\n\nPisces 20 FEB-20 MARCH You are flavour of the month \u2013 important people of all kinds will be eager to make your acquaintance this week. You may be flattered by their attention, but don\u2019t forget it works both ways. They\u2019ll want something in return for their favours. CALL 0904 470 1172 (65p per minute)*\n\nAries 21 MARCH-20 APRIL A time-consuming and complicated task is about to get easier, even if you don\u2019t make the effort to understand it. There\u2019s just one more emotional or financial hurdle to overcome before you\u2019re left with a clear run to the winning post. CALL 0904 470 1161 (65p per minute)*\n\nTaurus 21 APRIL-21 MAY This won\u2019t be a hard week but there could be confusion if you\u2019re not totally honest about your feelings, especially if you don\u2019t fully understand a financial or business matter. Better to speak up and look silly than worry yourself sick over trivia. CALL 0904 470 1162 (65p per minute)*\n\nGemini 22 MAY-21 JUNE You may understand how something works, but others will have trouble getting to grips with what to them is new and unusual. So don\u2019t just explain the mechanics, demonstrate how it works. You will be well rewarded for your efforts. CALL 0904 470 1163 (65p per minute)*\n\nCancer 22 JUNE-23 JULY The focus of your life won\u2019t alter instantly but by the time Venus changes signs on Friday, you\u2019ll have a clearer idea of what lies ahead. It may not seem as attractive as what you\u2019re leaving behind but, long-term, you will gain far more than you lose. CALL 0904 470 1164 (65p per minute)*\n\nLeo 24 JULY-23 AUG Venus, planet of peace, love and harmony, enters dynamic Sagittarius this week benefitting friendships, in general, and romance in particular. \u2018Anything goes\u2019 should be your motto: loved ones will be inspired by your sense of adventure. CALL 0904 470 1165 (65p per minute)*\n\nVirgo 24 AUG-23 SEPT Typical Virgos can get obsessed with their ambitions and work. But this week\u2019s aspects call for a more leisurely approach in which you put relationships first and spend more time with family and friends. You won\u2019t lose out by slowing down. CALL 0904 470 1166(65p per minute) *\n\nLibra 24 SEPT-23 OCT Communicate your needs clearly and concisely and you won\u2019t go wrong. Partners and colleagues are ready and willing to take some of the load off your shoulders but can\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking. Spell it out for them and they\u2019ll ease your burden.
