Who among us can say that? | Suzanne Moore", "language": "en", "text": "When Deborah Orr rang me up to ask me to write a piece for the now defunct arts magazine City Limits, in the star spot, I was shocked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be asking you if you weren\u2019t capable of doing something great,\u201d she said. \u201cSo don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want her to think I was stupid. Then I met her. She was in leather trousers, fag in one hand, scotch in the other, with a huge dog.\n\nColleagues pay tribute to journalist and 'lioness' Deborah Orr Read more\n\nEffortlessly cool. Absolutely singular. We became lifelong friends. I informed her I was a feminist and she said she had never heard anyone say that before. We would argue about that over the years, but whatever she identified as, it didn\u2019t matter to me. She broke conventions and boundaries as easily as others breathe, doing things in her inimitable Deborah way. Scary. Thrilling. Shocking.\n\nShe once head-butted an ex of mine when I wasn\u2019t there out of some misguided loyalty and then phoned me, shouting at me angrily because she\u2019d given herself a bruise on her forehead. Men were scared of her but also absolutely compelled by her. She was gorgeous. Even ill in hospital a few weeks ago her friend Tanya described her as \u201cshimmeringly beautiful\u201d.\n\nWe could have been competitors but something much more magnificent happened: we become co-conspirators. My success was her success, hers was mine, but in our early days at this newspaper no women were on the comment pages and no woman had edited the Weekend Guardian.\n\nShe became simply the most brilliant editor I ever had. Her instinct was mesmerising. She just knew stuff. I began to understand her incredible visual sense. She could design, she could draw, she could just see the world in a way no one else could. Her house and stunning garden were a testament to that. When I first used to go round to her flat in Brixton there were incredible mosaics that she had made \u2013 but we still had to eat tinned potatoes with ketchup as she insisted that was a nice dinner.\n\nGod was she difficult though, and I won\u2019t pretend otherwise. She would turn up at dinner parties with a bottle of whisky, drink it and berate the host. Yet she had a heart the size of Scotland. Infinite kindness and generosity. When a man managed to bleed on my ceiling putting up blinds she came round, sorted it out and then decided to strip the fireplace.\n\nShe also read nonstop. I never understood how she could read so much or how she understood plot so well. When we took the kids to see Derren Brown she worked out how he did it. What a mind!\n\nIt\u2019s funny to think I read some Andrea Dworkin at her wedding, but I did, and I was with her for the birth of her beloved Ivan. Luther came a few years later and has inherited her artistic gifts. She totally adored Maddy and Lexi, her wonderful stepchildren. Her refusal to be quiet for the sake of the kids about the hostility between her and her ex-husband was typical Deborah. Her brave, hard-won, often unpalatable honesty was at times difficult for all concerned.\n\nHer voice would not be silenced then and it won\u2019t be now as she left a magnificent memoir behind: Motherwell. I read it and called her \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d as she loved Elena Ferrante. When she was irritated with me as I tried to talk about \u201carrangements\u201d as she was so ill, she would sign off \u201cYour Thick Pal\u201d.\n\nShe also told me I was the crappest smoker she knew.\n\nThe only person I ever saw get the better of Deborah was my then 11-year-old in a row about which restaurant we went to on holiday in Jerusalem. As usual Deborah went hammer and tongs for it, had a drink, backed down and then danced for four hours in the hotel disco constantly telling us how much she loved us.\n\nSo many times I have tried to get her off the dancefloor. And failed. It\u2019s always a marathon. To see her lost in music was a joy. We went mad to Burning Down the House when we went to see David Byrne last year. She turned to me and said: \u201cI think that may have been the best three minutes of my life.\u201d\n\nYou just want the next book. Well, I just want more of her full stop, in her velvet swish\n\nAll her writing is there now for you to savour. It is full of empathy, nuance and humanity: the polar opposite of so many other formulaic, partisan columns. Motherwell, her memoir, is piercing in its insight and forgiveness. You just want the next book. Well, I just want more of her full stop, in her velvet swish. I want more of her withering put-downs, another lunch that turns into dinner and then why not go dancing?\n\nOne time we were getting on a plane from India and she was going straight from the airport into the office. She was wearing a bikini and tiny sarong. \u201cAre you gonna wear \u2026 you know, clothes?\u201d I asked her. \u201cAch,\u201d she said. \u201cRelax Suze.\u201d\n\nIn the days before her death, I told her to relax. She was alive through sheer strength of will and wanted so much to be with her boys by the sea. As it so happens I knew when to be there, though I had expected the last message from her to be \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fuck off?\u201d. I have had a few of those for being an interfering cow.\n\nDeborah ill was still the essence of Deborah. Actually the last text was: \u201cYou are Saturday to me. And my Friday night.\u201d I am so very glad I was there to tell her stories, all of them true, about all our crazy times. I am writing this by the light of the beautiful lamp she gave me. She had the best taste of anyone I have ever met.\n\nOh Deborah. In all her complicated glory she was wild. Untamed. Never not true to herself. \u201cWho among us can say that?\u201d I asked her in the ever-changing light of the big Brighton sky, as the sun glinted on the sea and I saw the small boat out on the horizon.\n\n\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist", "description": "As an editor, writer and my lifelong friend she was thrilling, shocking \u2013 and broke conventions as easily as others breathe, says Guardian columnist Suzanne Moore", "authors": ["Suzanne Moore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77278402cb3798f8daf8b4b16f44dd6cb6549da4/0_381_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=14e30cea0848dcf598ebc3c4608d0f0c", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
