Energy is making up less and less of the S&P 500", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "AFP/Getty Images Pump jacks on the Bakken Shale Formation, near Williston, N. Dak.\n\nEnergy companies are making up less of the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.08% and investors in exchange-traded funds should keep a careful eye on what that means for their holdings, according to a research note out Tuesday.\n\nAt 4.4% \u2014 down from 5.3% as recently as the end of 2018 \u2014 energy is only the eighth-largest sector in the index, just above utilities and real estate, CFRA analyst Todd Rosenbluth wrote. That's a fraction of the share it\u2019s held over the past decade or so. Even Exxon Mobil XOM, +1.06% , which for years was one of the top 10 holdings in the massive SPDR S&P 500 fund SPY, +1.14% , had fallen to the 12th-largest position by the end of August.\n\nAs always, that can mean very different things for different ETFs. Energy company representation in large, broad-based ETFs varies widely, CFRA points out: 6.5% in the iShares S&P 500 Value fund IVE, +1.23% , but just 2.7% of iShares S&P 500 Growth IVW, +1.05% \u2014 versus 11% of the Invesco S&P 500 Pure Value ETF RPV, +1.31% .\n\nRelated: Peak oil? A famed Texas oilman\u2019s ETF is going green\n\nThat means the Pure Value fund bucks the trend in declining investor interest in energy. The sector is third, behind financials and consumer discretionary. The ETF tracks something called the S&P 500 Pure Value Index, which includes securities that have strong value characteristics, which it defines as \u201cbook value-to-price ratio, earnings-to-price ratio and sales-to-price ratio.\u201d\n\nAmong its biggest holdings are Baker Hughes BHGE, +2.08% , making up nearly 2% of the fund, and Valero Energy Corp. VLO, +0.28% , at 1.8%.\n\nThere are a few factors driving the decline in energy\u2019s position in the S&P 500. Most importantly, the upswing in capital spending that accompanied the fracking revolution, running from about 2004 \u2013 2014, has now reversed. CFRA believes that the lower capital spending will at some point \u201cresult in disappointing production, but that imbalance is not here yet.\u201d\n\nInvestors seeking growth may be shunning energy companies since exploration and production companies \u201chave a checkered history of delivering production growth,\u201d in CFRA\u2019s words. As MarketWatch has previously reported, the sector has been the worst-performing this year as trade tensions, global growth concerns, and the long slow consumer pivot away from fossil fuels weigh on energy companies.\n\nRead: Where the 2020 Democrats stand on climate change", "description": "Energy is making up less and less of the broad stock index, but that means different things for different funds.", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HH231_frack__ZG_20190409111345.jpg"}
