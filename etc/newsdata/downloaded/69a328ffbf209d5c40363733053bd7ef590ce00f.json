The report did note that three crew members said they knew of no mechanical or electrical issues with the boat.\n\nThe report said that all six crew members were asleep when the fire broke out. Boats like the Conception, which caught fire around 3 a.m., are required to have a crew member keep watch at night.\n\nA lawyer representing Truth Aquatics, the company that owned the boat, disputed that part of the report.\n\n\u201cWe do have witness testimony that seems to contradict the notion that the entire crew was asleep,'' attorney Douglas Schwartz said in a statement. \"We do know that one crewmember checked on and around the galley area at around 2:30 a.m., approximately 30 minutes before the fire broke out.\u201d\n\nThe Coast Guard said it has convened a Marine Board of Investigation to determine the cause of the blaze. The bulletin noted it does not have to wait for the board's findings before taking \"immediate and positive\" action.\n\n\u201cIn some instances, our marine casualty boards identify pressing safety issues related to vessel stability, the engine room or lifesaving and firefighting equipment,\u201d said Capt. Jason Neubauer, chair of the Marine Board of Investigation. \u201cIn those instances, we issue safety alerts or bulletins.\"\n\nThe law that could make a difference: Charges may hinge on 1838 statute\n\nThe recommendations included ensuring that all required firefighting and safety equipment is on the boat and operational, that emergency escapes are clearly recognizable and functional, and that crew members understand their roles.\n\nBoat operators also should \"reduce potential fire hazards and consider limiting the unsupervised charging of lithium-ion batteries and extensive use of power strips and extension cords,\" the bulletin said.\n\n\"The intensity of the fire surprised people,\" Peter Goelz, former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, told USA TODAY. \"If it was being fed by lithium batteries, that might explain it.\"\n\nThe Conception is engulfed in flames in this Sept. 2, 2019, file photo provided by the Santa Barbara County (Calif.) Fire Department. Thirty-four people were killed in the fire aboard the commercial scuba diving vessel off the Southern California coast. More\n\nGoelz says he's never heard of charging stations being linked to a boat fire \u2013 but he was not surprised by the bulletin. On commercial airplanes, crew members have gloves, tongs and flame-smothering bags at the ready, he noted.\n\nMore than 30 divers spending a long weekend packed on a boat could have a lot of phones, cameras and laptops to charge, he said. One survivor even suggested the fire may have started in an area where electronics were charging.\n\n\"I've heard that a lot of attention is going there,\" Goelz told USA TODAY. \"Did they have a charging station of epic proportions? Were electronics stacked up? We don't know yet.\"\n\nOthers issues being reviewed include passenger access to escape hatches.\n\nThe NTSB report said one of five crew members sleeping in the wheelhouse was awakened by a noise. He found a fire rising from a compartment below, awakened the other crew members and the captain radioed a distress message to the Coast Guard, the report said.\n\nCrew members attempted to reach the bunk area where passengers and one crew member were sleeping but could not because of the flames, the report said. The captain and two others jumped into the water and swam around the boat and entered from another area but still could not access the passengers because of the fire.\n\nThey then launched a small skiff, picked up two crew members from the water, and went to a nearby recreational boat where they continued efforts to bring help.", "description": "In the wake of the deadly California dive boat fire, the Coast Guard recommends boat operators limit the unsupervised use of power strips.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mRC4OPFeA.qm_T8OlvC_Sg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/34638ac342dba21c3802a124823e715c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
