Fears of military conflict across the Persian Gulf cloud organizers\u2019 sunny projections. And the planning for the event, which begins Oct. 20, 2020, highlights the contradictions of Dubai and the wider United Arab Emirates, a nation governed by hereditary rulers, wildly enriched by its oil reserves and built by foreign laborers.\n\n\u201cWe can only again invite, we can only be open, we can only facilitate, we can only give discounts to incentivize them to come,\u201d said Tarek Oliveira Shayya, a board director for Expo 2020 and its chief spokesman. \u201cThe response, however, will come from them.\u201d\n\nWorld\u2019s fairs conjure great wonders of engineering, like Paris\u2019 Eiffel Tower for the 1889 fair. The light bulb and the Ferris wheel dazzled those at the 1893 fair in Chicago. The X-ray followed at Buffalo\u2019s 1901 fair, and Seattle\u2019s Space Needle opened to visitors at the 1962 fair.\n\nBut some of these extravaganzas can also turn sour. The 1984 world\u2019s fair in New Orleans went bankrupt and required a government bailout. Expo 2000 in Germany drew 18 million visitors, well short of the 40 million expected. Milan\u2019s 2015 expo saw rioting over corruption allegations.\n\nWhile estimating Expo 2020 will account for as much as 2.5% of Dubai\u2019s gross domestic product during its run, the government-backed bank Emirates NBD has warned that world\u2019s fairs \u201chave also resulted in higher than expected costs, increased debt for host cities, \u2018white elephants\u2019 and abandoned buildings.\u201d\n\nDubai functions like a company town. Its marquee employers are the state-owned Emirates airline, state-backed real estate developers and other government-associated industries. And those industries helped build the Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building at 828 meters (2,717 feet), the largest manmade harbor at its Jebel Ali port, and the manmade, frond-shaped Palm Jumeirah archipelago in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe city\u2019s well-known appetite for megaprojects once inspired a 2016 article from the satirical website The Onion about Dubai building \u201cthe world\u2019s first full-scale replica of Dubai, a multibillion-dollar investment known as the Dubai Experience built on the outskirts of the city-state.\u201d\n\nAt the center of the Expo 2020 site is the Al Wasl Dome, a 65-meter-high (213-foot) structure that will see videos and designs projected across it. Its Sustainability Pavilion, which recalls the towers of New York\u2019s 1964 world\u2019s fair, will be covered in solar panels and surrounded by similarly paneled \u201cenergy trees\u201d to make it a zero-energy structure. Construction crews will also build a network of roads and a connection to Dubai\u2019s driverless Metro line.\n\nAll told, construction costs around the event are estimated at $7 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are building a city,\u201d Shayya said. \u201cWe are not building an Expo site. We are building a city and it\u2019s a city that is going to be one of the smartest cities in the world.\u201d\n\nBut Dubai will need to incorporate the new city into its sprawling real estate market after the six-month expo ends on April 10, 2021. And already, that market shows signs of trouble.\n\nReal estate speculation and the Great Recession helped drag down Dubai\u2019s economy in 2009. A sharp drop in oil prices in 2014 also hurt its economy, as has tension between the U.S. and Iran and the war in Yemen.\n\nDubai\u2019s real estate market, which has been a major economic driver since it allowed foreigners to own property beginning in 2002, has seen its value drop by a third since its 2014 peak. Apartments, villas and office space stand empty, and more properties are due to come onto the market in the coming years, sparking enough alarm for Dubai\u2019s government to set up a commission to come up with ways of heading off the problem.\n\nExpo officials point out that the German industrial conglomerate Siemens plans to open an office at the site after the expo closes. They believe other businesses, drawn by the expo, will follow suit.\n\nHowever, uncompleted \u201cwhite elephant\u201d projects lurk around Dubai, like the Palm Jebel Ali, the unfinished twin of the Palm Jumeirah. A massive amusement park that recently opened near the Expo 2020 site reported a loss of $57 million last year and canceled an expansion. And the Al Maktoum International Airport, envisioned to one day take over for Dubai International Airport, has seen repeated delays to its expansion.\n\nSuccess for the event may also hinge on events beyond Dubai\u2019s control. Flights out of the country already swing wide around the Strait of Hormuz, the mouth of the Persian Gulf, because of U.S.-Iranian tensions. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, whom the UAE has been battling in a Saudi-led coalition for years, have repeatedly threatened to target the country.\n\nExpo 2020 officials say their event will be \u201capolitical.\u201d Iran will take part, officials say. Qatar, the energy-rich nation that the UAE and three other Arab countries have been boycotting over a political dispute since 2017, has been invited, and discussions are under way, said David Bishop, an Expo 2020 spokesman. Also taking part is Israel, which Gulf Arab countries don\u2019t recognize.\n\nConstruction continues unabated. Parts of the UAE\u2019s pavilion, which will look like a falcon in flight, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s exhibition, which will resemble a window looking up to the sky, are up. Others have begun construction under the relentless heat and humidity of Dubai, where it can go over 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer.\n\nTwo workers have been killed on the site, and there have been 43 other \u201cserious incidents\u201d resulting in injuries, said Rob Cooling, vice president of safety and environment at Expo 2020. That\u2019s over the course of some 140 million man-hours of labor expended so far, he said, as authorities offer training and cooling areas for workers.\n\n\u201cWhen these incidents happen they are absolutely tragic, but they are subject to a very, very detailed, thorough independent investigation,\u201d Cooling said. \u201cJust to emphasize: At no stage are we complacent. We\u2019re also always looking to maintain and, in fact, drive continued improvement.\u201d", "description": "Expo 2020 is a new city built in the desert of Dubai.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT498_expo_ZG_20191017093025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
