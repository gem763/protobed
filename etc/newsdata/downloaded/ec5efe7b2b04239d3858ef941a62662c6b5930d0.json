Some of the tampering occurred in a specific area of Fort Lauderdale, according to police. Williams is now under investigation for his connection to those events, which involved cutting brake lines and took place within a two-block area of Williams\u2019s home, according to NBC News.\n\nWilliams was caught red-handed on camera, police said.\n\nBecause police considered Williams to be a suspect, they set up scooters to see if he would tamper with the green, white and black Lime-branded scooters.\n\nHe did, without fail, they said.\n\nIn police video, a man identified by authorities as Williams can be seen casually walking up to two planted Lime scooters with a sharp object in his hands. He tampers with the handle on one scooter, places something in his shirt pocket and starts touching the neighboring scooter. He walks out of the frame for a few seconds before returning, then bends down and uses what looks like a cutting object to cause further damage to the ride.\n\nWilliams was arrested shortly after the video was recorded, NBC Miami reported.\n\nWilliams said he \u201cdid not want to dig himself into a grave\u201d after his arrest, according to NBC Miami.\n\nThe arrest report said his actions could have caused serious harm or death to riders, as the scooters can reach speeds of 15 to 17 miles per hour. No scooter-related injuries have been reported to police, according to NBC Miami.\n\nIt costs about $70 to repair each scooter \u2014 costs for which Williams could be responsible if he is convicted, according to NBC Miami.\n\nLime told NBC Miami it was pleased that Fort Lauderdale police were able to make an arrest and that none of its riders were harmed. The company also said it would take legal action against anyone who damages or vandalizes its scooters, the station reported.\n\nPolice urge the public to contact the appropriate vendor if a scooter appears to have been tampered with.\n\nWilliam has since bonded out of jail.\n\nRead more:\n\nElectric scooters have arrived in Europe \u2014 and a lot of people there hate them too\n\nHyundai\u2019s solution for navigating traffic-clogged cities: Mounting an electric scooter on your car\n\nMopeds for rent are taking over cities.
