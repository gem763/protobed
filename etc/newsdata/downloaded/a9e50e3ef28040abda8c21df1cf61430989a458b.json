He\u2019s suing for defamation.", "language": "en", "text": "Edward Dickinson Tayloe II was not happy.\n\nA Charlottesville newspaper had published a profile earlier this year featuring him as one of 13 people suing to prevent the removal of the city\u2019s embattled Confederate monuments. So far, okay \u2014 but the story focused heavily on his family\u2019s slaveholding history.\n\n\u201cTayloe, 76, comes from a First Family of Virginia that was one of the largest slave-owning dynasties in Virginia,\u201d reads the article, written by Lisa Provence for the C-Ville Weekly. It goes on to quote a University of Virginia professor, Jalane Schmidt, who claimed the Tayloes had antagonized black people for generations.\n\nAlmost exactly two months after the story came out, Tayloe took his revenge. He sued all three \u2014 the paper, the reporter and the professor \u2014 for defamation, demanding more than $1 million in damages.\n\nBy referencing his family\u2019s slaveholding past in a story about Tayloe\u2019s fight to preserve the monuments, Tayloe\u2019s lawyers argued, the C-Ville Weekly and Schmidt implied their client was a racist. The fallout caused Tayloe to suffer \u201chumiliation\u201d and \u201cemotional distress,\u201d among other things, the lawyers wrote in court documents.\n\n\u201cThe Profile damaged Plaintiff Tayloe\u2019s personal and professional reputation by alleging \u2026 Tayloe opposed [removing the monuments] because he is a racist and an opponent of people of color,\u201d reads the complaint, filed this May in Virginia circuit court.\n\n[They were once America's cruelest, richest slave traders. Why does no one know their names?]\n\nSome legal experts reached by The Washington Post said Tayloe\u2019s defamation claim is far-fetched and unlikely to succeed in court. Others cautioned it is too soon to know. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the suit \u2014 spurring Tayloe to file an opposition brief \u2014 and attorneys for both sides are set to make oral arguments before a judge in late October.\n\nNo matter how the case proceeds, experts said, two things are clear: It is probably the first of its kind in the United States. If not unprecedented, it\u2019s certainly unusual to contend the revelation of details about slaveholding ancestors constitutes defamation, law professors said.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s probably going to happen again. Soon.\n\nTayloe\u2019s lawyers declined to comment on their client\u2019s behalf. The C-Ville Weekly and Provence also declined to comment. Schmidt\u2019s attorney Eden Heilman \u2014 the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, which is undertaking Schmidt\u2019s case pro bono \u2014 said she is optimistic her client will win.\n\n\u201cI am very confident that the defamation pieces of his argument are not presented adequately for the case to go through, and we are extremely hopeful that the court agrees,\u201d Heilman said.\n\nThe lawsuit was earlier reported by the Daily Beast.\n\n\n\nA visitor eats lunch in front of a statue of Robert E.

(Steve Helber/AP)\n\n\u201cIt seems that as a society we\u2019re currently revisiting our history of slavery,\u201d said Evan Mascagni, the political director for Public Participation Project, a nonprofit that advocates First Amendment rights. \u201cAs more and more information comes to light \u2026 I think we will see a rise in lawsuits targeting those who are drawing attention to that family history.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think this is the beginning.\u201d\n\n[There\u2019s a new way to deal with Confederate monuments: Signs that explain their racist history]\n\nFor Tayloe, the saga started when Charlottesville\u2019s City Council voted in 2017 to remove statues of Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson from the city\u2019s downtown area.\n\nHe and 12 others soon filed a lawsuit to bar the monuments\u2019 removal \u2014 a few months before the memorials served as the site of the white supremacist \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally that left one woman dead. Undeterred, Tayloe and his fellow plaintiffs pressed forward. This month a Virginia judge ruled taking down the monuments would violate historic preservation laws.\n\nThe triumph may have been less than total for Tayloe. The C-Ville Weekly profile was still online \u2014 as it is today.\n\nThe story, published online March 6, is unsparing in its depiction of his family\u2019s deep ties to the slave trade. The Tayloes built a massive fortune by operating several cotton plantations \u2014 including, at one point, at least seven in Alabama \u2014 manned by enslaved laborers, the C-Ville Weekly reported.\n\nThough the international slave trade became illegal in the early 1800s, the family continued to mint money partly by engaging in the domestic version, according to the C-Ville Weekly.\n\nThe Tayloes forced hundreds of enslaved people \u201cto walk 800 miles to Alabama, where most were sold,\u201d the C-Ville Weekly reported.\n\nProvence tried to contact Tayloe for the story, according to the article, but was referred to a cousin, who told her the \u201cvast majority of my Virginia family are against Confederate monuments.\u201d The reporter also chatted with Schmidt, who leads free historical tours of Charlottesville\u2019s Confederate statues every month.\n\n\u201cFor generations this family has been roiling the lives of black people, and this is what [Plaintiff Tayloe] chooses to pursue,\u201d Schmidt told Provence, referencing the monuments lawsuit.\n\n[Are Confederate monument fans committing the sin of idol worship? An unusual Charlottesville Bible study makes the case.]\n\nTaken together, Tayloe\u2019s lawsuit alleges, the framing and the quote did irreparable harm to his standing in Charlottesville, where he\u2019s lived since 1958.\n\nTayloe grew up in the area, according to the suit, graduating from a local high school before enlisting and serving in the Vietnam War, during which he won the Bronze Star for Valor. Later, after earning a bachelor of science from East Carolina University and studying finance in New York, he returned to Virginia and spent roughly 30 years working as a \u201cstockbroker, trust investment officer, and financial planner,\u201d the suit says.\n\nThe suit alleges that the article destroyed decades of goodwill built up with clients and neighbors by falsely insinuating that Tayloe is \u201ca racist\u201d who joined the monuments lawsuit to \u201cantagonize people of color.\u201d The story also implied he \u2014 like his ancestors \u2014 generally hopes to \u201croil the lives of black people,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nTayloe, the suit says, \u201chas condemned racism for his entire life, and does so now.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the C-Ville Weekly and Schmidt contend this argument is nonsense. In a court filing, the paper argued the article contains \u201cno defamatory matter\u201d because it merely states accurate facts about Tayloe\u2019s family background, before quoting Schmidt\u2019s personal view on the matter. (Tayloe does not contest the story\u2019s factual accuracy in the lawsuit, instead challenging what he views as the article\u2019s implications.)\n\nHeilman, the ACLU lawyer, said in a phone interview that opinions \u2014 including the one her client shared with the C-Ville Weekly \u2014 \u201ccannot be defamatory as a matter of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Schmidt is stating her opinion about someone who is participating in a piece of litigation,\u201d Heilman said. \u201cThat\u2019s protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nThat line of argument is likely to be effective in court, said Eugene Volokh, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies defamation cases.\n\nIn Virginia, as in most states, proving defamation requires establishing that someone made a false factual assertion that causes harm to another person\u2019s reputation \u2014 a statement that \u201cexposes this person to public hostility \u2026 scorn, ridicule, contempt,\u201d Volokh said. The newspaper article does not meet this standard, according to Volokh, who predicted the judge will dismiss the case.\n\n\u201c[Tayloe] will lose, and he ought to lose,\u201d said Volokh, who said he had never encountered a suit like Tayloe\u2019s before.\n\n[Two women lead a free tour of Charlottesville\u2019s Confederate monuments each month. A new website lets everyone listen.]\n\nDeborah R. Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, also said the suit was a novelty. But she was less certain of Tayloe\u2019s immediate defeat: \u201cThere is a case to be made for the judge dismissing it, but I wouldn\u2019t put money on it,\u201d she said.\n\nGerhardt added that the case probably will serve as an important test of a new kind of law Virginia passed in recent years that aims to protect residents\u2019 First Amendment rights. That statute, known colloquially as \u201canti-SLAPP legislation,\u201d says people are not legally liable \u2014 and cannot face defamation claims \u2014 for anything they say that is protected under the right to free speech granted by the First Amendment.\n\nSLAPP stands for \u201cStrategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation.\u201d Virginia, which updated its anti-SLAPP law in 2017, is one of 29 states to pass anti-SLAPP legislation since the idea was popularized by two law school professors in the late 1980s.\n\nGiven that Virginia\u2019s version is nearly brand-new, Gerhardt said, the Tayloe case could set an influential precedent.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the anti-SLAPP legislation is to protect people who are exercising their right to free expression,\u201d Gerhardt said. \u201cSo it was designed exactly for the types of people that could be sued in this case.\u201d\n\nHeilman and other ACLU lawyers have alleged that Tayloe\u2019s lawsuit counts as a SLAPP suit in court documents. She said the chance to chart the course of SLAPP legal history in Virginia is partly what attracted the ACLU to the case.\n\n\u201cBut most importantly, defamation cases like this have the potential to really, really chill free speech,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is highly concerning to us \u2014 now more than ever.\u201d", "description": "By referencing his family\u2019s slaveholding past in a story about Edward Dickinson Tayloe II's desire to preserve Confederate monuments, his lawyers argue, the C-Ville Weekly implied their client was a racist.", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
