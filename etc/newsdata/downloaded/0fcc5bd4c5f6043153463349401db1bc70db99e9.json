REUTERS/Eva Plevier\n\nFive siblings, estimated to be aged between 18 and 25, and a man they identified as their ailing father were found near Ruinerwold, a village in the northern province of Drenthe.\n\nA man who police said had paid the rent on the property was detained, although they could not say on Wednesday whether he was suspected of a crime. Local mayor Roger de Groot had said on Tuesday that the 58-year-old was not the father of the family.\n\n\u201cThe man is still in custody and is being questioned,\u201d said Drenthe police spokeswoman Grietje Hartstra. \u201cA lot is still unclear and we are investigating exactly what happened there.\u201d\n\nThe family was discovered after one member, a 25-year-old man and the eldest of the siblings according to local media, sought help at a nearby cafe.\n\nIn a statement, police said they found the family in a \u201csmall space in the house which could be locked\u201d and that it was unclear whether they were being held against their will.\n\nInvestigators have not commented on published reports that the family may have held apocalyptic \u201cend of days\u201d beliefs.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of speculation in the media about what happened, but as police we deal with facts. We still have a lot of unanswered questions,\u201d Hartstra said.\n\nThe mother of the children was believed to have died before the family moved to the Dutch farm in 2010, De Groot said. None of the family members was registered as a resident with the municipality, police said.\n\nREMOTE SPOT\n\nThe farm is located on a secluded plot of land on the outskirts of the village, where residents speculated about how anyone could have been hidden away for so long in their tiny community without being noticed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible here ... (it) is such a remote spot, in the middle of fields,\u201d said neighbour Roelie van Dijk. \u201cYou see it can happen anywhere. Not only in a big city but also in the countryside. And perhaps even more in the countryside, where you can hide completely.\u201d\n\nVan Dijk said she and her husband had seen a man driving in and out of the property for years and doing construction work. He always kept the gates closed and never socialised, she said.\n\nHer husband Sjon said he once asked to see how the renovations were coming along, but the man yelled \u201cno\u201d and sped off.\n\n\u201cWe tried to make contact, my husband just last week, with the man in the car...(But) he drove on. He went through the gates and locked them again.\u201d\n\nThe siblings had apparently lived in makeshift rooms inside the farm and survived partly on vegetables and animals from a secluded garden on the property, local TV RTV Drenthe reported.", "description": "Dutch police are questioning a man who paid the rent on a farmhouse where six members of a family were found locked away in a secret room after apparently living for years in isolation, authorities said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Hilde Verweij", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441484173&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0R6", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
