(The couple\u2019s eldest son, Michael, 22, also attends NYU and was moving into his own apartment in the Big Apple.)\n\nBut while Ripa expected the drop-off to be emotional for her and Consuelos, she was particularly taken aback at how much it affected her younger two children, who are only 20 months apart.\n\n\u201cWe moved Lola into her dorm and it\u2019s one of those things that you don\u2019t realize how close [the kids are],\u201d Ripa admitted. \u201cThe younger two are really close in age. Like, I didn\u2019t even know I was pregnant with the third one because I was still nursing the second one!\u201d\n\n\u201cI just assumed that, you know, I was just gaining weight from nursing. I was that one person who was gaining weight from nursing,\u201d Ripa continued. \u201cSo they really are very, very close and I didn\u2019t realize how close they were until it was time to say goodbye.\u201d\n\nThe talk show co-host went on to share a number of photos from the drop-off, including one of Lola in her new dorm \u2014 complete with ombre pink bedding and her \u201cold school\u201d refrigerator, which Ripa said \u201clooks like it\u2019s from the \u201950s.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has four roommates so it\u2019s quite crowded in there,\u201d Ripa shared of the room. \u201c[They] all just met, it\u2019s all brand new. Scary and exciting \u2026 The room is so tiny, you just forget how tiny it is!\u201d\n\nOther photos featured an \u201coverwhelmed\u201d Joaquin sleeping on his sister\u2019s bed as the family continued to set up the \u201ctiny\u201d dorm room, a sweet group shot of Lola with her parents, and a touching snap of Joaquin and Lola hugging as they said goodbye.\n\nAside from the sentimental moments, Ripa said there were plenty of jokes to go around.\n\nThe mom of three revealed that her husband\u2019s words of wisdom to his only daughter prior to leaving were: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to get the syllabus, the syllabus is your best friend! Let the syllabus be your guiding light [and] time management is your friend.\u201d\n\nKelly Ripa and Lola | Audrey Slater/Instagram More\n\nRELATED: Lisa Rinna, Kelly Ripa and All of the Other Celebs Sending Their Kids Off to College This Fall\n\nAs for whether or not Ripa and Consuelos shed any tears at the final goodbye?\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t real tears but there were lots of \u2018Don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be home before Thanksgiving because I\u2019m not.
