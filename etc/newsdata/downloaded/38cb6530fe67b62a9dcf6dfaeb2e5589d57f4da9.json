What does that mean for existing startups and businesses? Simply put: nothing. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can ignore it forever.\n\nThere are three main points that anyone concerned with the possibility of quantum computing affecting their work should understand.\n\n1. It\u2019ll be a long time before anything really practical comes out of quantum computing.\n\nGoogle showed that quantum computers are not only functional, but apparently scalable. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re scaling right now. And if they were, it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything useful you can do with them.\n\nWhat makes quantum computing effective is that it\u2019s completely different from classical computing \u2014 and that also makes creating the software and algorithms that run on it essentially a completely unexplored space.\n\nThere are theories, of course, and some elementary work on how to use these things to accomplish practical goals. But we are only just now arriving at the time when such theories can be tested at the most basic levels. The work that needs to happen isn\u2019t so much \u201cbringing to market\u201d as \u201cfundamental understanding.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s tempting to equate the beginning of quantum computing to the beginning of digital computing, in reality they are very different. Classical computing, with its 1s and 0s and symbolic logic, actually maps readily on to human thought processes and ways of thinking about information \u2014 with a little abstraction, of course.\n\nQuantum computing, on the other hand, is very different from how humans think about and interact with data. It doesn\u2019t make intuitive sense, and not only because we haven\u2019t developed the language for it. Our minds really just don\u2019t work that way!\n\nSo although even I can now claim to have operated a quantum computer (technically true), there are remarkably few people in the world who can say they can do so deliberately in pursuit of a specific problem. That means progress will be slow (by tech industry standards) and very limited for years to come as the basics of this science are established and the ideas of code and data that we have held for decades are loosened.\n\n2. Early applications will be incredibly domain-specific and not generalizable.\n\nA common misunderstanding of quantum computing is that it amounts to extremely fast parallel processing. Now, if someone had invented a device that performed supercomputer-like operations faster than any actual supercomputer, that would be an entirely different development and, frankly, a much more useful one. But that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nAs an engineer explained to me at Google\u2019s lab, not only are quantum computers good at completely different things, they\u2019re incredibly bad at the things classical computers do well. If you wanted to do arithmetical logic like addition and multiplication, it would be much better and faster to use an abacus.\n\nPart of the excitement around quantum computing is learning which tasks a qubit-based system is actually good at. There are theories, but as mentioned before, they\u2019re untested. It remains to be seen whether a given optimization problem or probability space navigation is really suitable for this type of computer at all.\n\nWhat they are pretty sure about so far is that there are certain very specific tasks that quantum computers will trivialize \u2014 but it isn\u2019t something general like \u201ccompression and decompression\u201d or \u201csorting databases.\u201d It\u2019s things like evaluating a galaxy of molecules in all possible configurations and conformations to isolate high-probability interactions.\n\nAs you can imagine, that isn\u2019t very useful for an enterprise security company. On the other hand, it could be utterly transformative for a pharmacology or materials company. Do you run one of those? Then in all likelihood, you are already investing in this kind of research and are well aware of the possibilities quantum brings to the table.\n\nBut the point is these applications will not only be very few in number, but difficult to conceptualize, prove, and execute. Unlike something like a machine learning agent, this isn\u2019t a new approach that can easily be tested and iterated \u2014 it\u2019s an entirely new discipline which people can only now truly begin to learn.", "description": "Google and NASA have demonstrated that quantum computing isn\u2019t just a fancy trick, but almost certainly something actually useful \u2014 and they\u2019re already working on commercial applications.
