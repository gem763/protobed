He had pleaded not guilty in the case, in which prosecutors had claimed his abuse was abetted by unidentified conspirators who helped provide him with a stream of young girls and women to satisfy his sexual obsessions.\n\nProsecutors have said they are continuing to investigate the case, leaving open the prospect that others could be criminally charged.", "description": "The revelation by Maxwell's attorney came at hearing over how to handle the documents.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan Kevin Breuninger", "Dan Mangan", "Kevin Breuninger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106071604-1565364545796epstein.jpg?v=1567603087"}
