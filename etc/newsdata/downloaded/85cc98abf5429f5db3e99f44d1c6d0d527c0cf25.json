Here\u2019s some satellite footage. Prefer your hurricane coverage from the ground, with bending trees and stuff getting washed out to sea? No problem, some guy with an iPhone is always ready to risk life and limb for the chance to make a viral video.\n\nFrom satellite imagery to 24/7 cable, not to mention the nonstop chatter of the internet, we\u2019re all now exposed to far more minute-by-minute information about potential threats than ever before.\n\nThat includes photos of fires in the Amazon \u2014 some years-old and not of the actual rainforest.\n\nYes, extreme weather can kill by the thousands, and do billions in property damage. But things actually aren\u2019t getting worse. Notably, last year\u2019s report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated, \u201cno significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone [i.e., hurricane] frequency over the past century.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean climate change isn\u2019t a real issue, or that it\u2019s not important to protect the rain forest. But with weather as with politics (and anything else that stands a good chance of getting clicks), the modern world is full of people eager to grab your attention with fear or outrage.\n\nEvacuate if you\u2019re told to, certainly, and feel free to marvel at all the amazing weather photos and graphics you like \u2014 but generally you\u2019ll do fine by just keeping an eye or ear on the weather report.", "description": "With Hurricane Dorian headed out to sea and vastly diminished from the monster that slammed the northeastern Bahamas, it\u2019s time to consider how the advance of technology leaves many of us feeling less safe.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/hurricane-dorian-weather.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
