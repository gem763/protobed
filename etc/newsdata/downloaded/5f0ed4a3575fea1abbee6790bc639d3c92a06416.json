For lovers of the 9th art, the museum is a timeless nugget.\n\n\"I am 57 years old. At 27 years-old this museum opened, I was there, it was very small there was not much. And I said to myself: But nobody will come to see that, it does not interest anyone! And 30 years later I come back, I have already returned in the meantime see many exhibitions, 30 years near I come back I say to myself: it's not only for children,\" says one visitor.\n\nIf the museum is celebrating its 30th anniversary, its leaders do not just want to look back. They also seek to look to the future and to evolve in the image of readers and society\n\n\"The good news is that the audience continues to grow. There are always more and more visitors, readers and with an exhibition like Emmanuel Lepage we also touch another audience that can go to documentary or other genres. I believe that the comic book is not only about children but also adults and all the topics that make the news, which make our daily life, our history and it constantly evolves constantly, \" explains M\u00e9lanie Andrieu, head of exhibitions at the Comic Strip Museum.\n\nhas been in the business for 30 years.
