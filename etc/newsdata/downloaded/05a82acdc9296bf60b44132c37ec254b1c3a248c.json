Juninho will have to think. We are not where we wanted to be, that's for sure.\"\n\nLyon host Dijon on October 19 after the international break, before a Champions League trip to Portugal to face Benfica.", "description": "The Brazilian has paid the price for a poor start to the season with, despite having only taken the head coach job in May", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.BUvv2c2q7M6EVZg502Rog--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ewzs4HQj7WPHFzjJuO_vLw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/267eb8a58e152582343fbee5d3968247", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
