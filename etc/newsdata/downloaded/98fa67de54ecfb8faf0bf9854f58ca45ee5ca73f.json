Apple is looking to raise between $4 billion and $5 billion, according to Dow Jones.\n\nApple has $210.6 billion on cash and marketable securities on hand, the company said in July, down 26% from its first-quarter 2018 peak of $285.1 billion. It also has $98.3 billion in total term debt as of the end of the June quarter, according to the prospectus.\n\nApple announced that it would increase its share buyback program by $75 billion in April and raised its quarterly dividend by 5%.\n\nApple has said it's aiming for an net-cash-netural position. The company is also investing in the United States, including a planned $1 billion campus in Austin, Texas.", "description": "It's the first time Apple has borrowed through the bond market since U.S. tax reform took affect in early 2018.", "authors": ["Kif Leswing"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106014090-1562856620048gettyimages-1154875213.jpeg?v=1562856640"}
