No missiles, no anti-aircraft weapons, no anti-tank,\" added the source, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military affairs.\n\nWashington's policy towards the YPG has underscored the broader complexities of its role in the Syrian conflict that developed from protests against President Bashar al-Assad into a multi-sided war and sucked in Russia, Turkey and Iran.\n\nThough the SDF proved an effective ally against IS, U.S. support for it infuriated Turkey. Ankara views the YPG as terrorists because of links to the Kurdish PKK movement which has waged a long insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nSyrian opposition sources said some of the Turkey-backed Syrians now facing the SDF benefited from U.S. military support in an earlier phase of the war, when the Central Intelligence Agency oversaw a program to arm and train anti-Assad rebels.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump shut down that program in 2017, part of an effort at the time to improve U.S. relations with Russia, Assad's most powerful ally. The program was criticised because some of the rebels switched to jihadist groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n'ROJAVA' AT RISK\n\nThe SDF currently numbers around 40,000 fighters, a second YPG source said. On top of this, Kurdish authorities had long established other security forces such as the Asayish numbering in the tens of thousands.\n\nThough the United States did not provide heavy or advanced weapons, Kurdish fighters have sourced anti-tank missiles on their own, the second YPG source said.\n\n\"Our duty is to resist. This is the Middle East and the black market is in full swing,\" the source said.\n\nA Syrian rebel source familiar with Turkey's position said Ankara has long been monitoring the weapons delivered to the YPG, a point of friction with Washington. \"They were constantly in discussion with the Americans about the type of weapons being given to the (YPG)/PKK,\" the source said.\n\nThe part of the border that U.S. forces vacated this week, a nearly 100-km (62-mile) stretch between the Syrian towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ain, is now under attack. Turkey began pounding the region with air strikes and artillery on Wednesday.\n\nThe area is mainly flatland, making it a tough battlefield for hardened YPG fighters who have gained years of experience in urban warfare fighting jihadists but are left almost defenceless against Turkish warplanes.\n\nThat border strip, part of which historically had a strong Arab presence, is important to Syrian Kurdish fighters because it links the mainly Kurdish swathes of the Northeast with the Kurdish town of Kobani, where U.S. and allied troops still have a base.\n\nDepending on how deep Turkey pushes into Syria, the territorial contiguity of the SDF region in northern Syria, known as Rojava in Kurdish, could be endangered.\n\nThe SDF, which controls around a quarter of Syria across the North and East, has said the U.S. move amounted to a \"stab in the back.\"\n\nWashington has opposed the emergence of autonomous regions that Kurdish leaders and their allies carved out in Syria, even as it has militarily backed the SDF - which includes Arabs and other ethnicities.\n\n\n\n\n\n'BITING LIKE A MOSQUITO'", "description": "Kurdish fighters who defeated Islamic State across much of Syria with U.S. help will struggle to fend off the Turkish army and its Syrian rebel allies who thrust across the border on Wednesday in a long-threatened offensive.
