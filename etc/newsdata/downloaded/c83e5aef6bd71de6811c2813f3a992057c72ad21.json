There\u2019s also stronger hints than ever that a journey in time will happen and our heroine seems pretty determined to keep her brood safe. Whether that\u2019s the future\u2019s advanced weapons or medication, we\u2019ll have to find out.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s safer in the future,\u2019 we hear her say. \u2018It\u2019s time.\u2019\n\nWe might be time-travelling again very soon in the fifth season of the romantic drama (Picture: Starz)\n\nFrom the looks of a possible riot at Aunt Jocasta\u2019s house to Roger wanting to go back to the 1960s, there will be plenty to keep fans patiently (or maybe not so patiently) waiting until the new year to find out what happens.\n\nOf course, for most viewers the biggest revelation of the trailer is the return of John Grey. He was last seen in the fourth season grappling with his feelings for Jamie, and coming to an understanding with Claire that he was in love with her husband. Now, he looks set to make an almighty comeback, but why has he reappeared now? Could he even be hiding something?\n\nWe\u2019ve also had several behind-the-scenes snaps at filming of the new serial, and it looks like viewers are in for a few surprises. Could Claire really time-travel again? It certainly appears that way from the pictures and hints in the new trailer.\n\nJamie\u2019s loyalties will be tested in the new episodes (Picture: Starz)\n\nApparently Claire and Jamie aren\u2019t out of the woods yet either as season five will see their relationship tested more than ever before. As if they haven\u2019t been through enough!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutlander season 5 comes to Starz in 2020. Fans can stream seasons one to four now on Amazon Prime.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
