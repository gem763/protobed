The voice of the woman identified by authorities as Eley is heard in the background directing them to stop because it is a children\u2019s park.\n\nAD\n\nThe teen who was swinging dismounts, and the woman walks over in her blue-and-white running shorts and quarter-sleeved shirt, and pounds her palms on the large orange swing, stopping its momentum.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are children,\u201d one of the girls says to the woman.\n\nThe woman walks over to the teen and disputes her claim.\n\nwe were just trying to play \ud83d\ude14 i guess were adults pic.twitter.com/7RaLogxV2C \u2014 r lean \u00bf (@arlenedgaf) October 16, 2019\n\nThe teens respond with laughter and chatter. The woman then claims she is a law enforcement officer.\n\n\u201cOkay, well, I\u2019m a f------ PD, so get the f--- out of here now if you\u2019re not here to play as a child,\u201d the woman shouted, pointing her finger.\n\nThe teen whom the woman initially walked toward tells the woman that she\u2019s 16 years old. That age, according to the woman, is not a child\u2019s age, which would allow her to arrest the girl.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhich is your choice? Are you a child or a G-------- adult?\u201d the woman asked the teen.\n\nThe person holding the camera and her friends observe that the woman wasn\u2019t \u201con duty\u201d and questioned why she was cursing at their friend.\n\nThe video has been viewed 5 million times and fed online debate about white people feeling entitled to police minority communities.\n\nAD\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department tweeted the following day that Eley isn\u2019t an officer and that officers were investigating the incident.\n\nA real officer of the law, Det. B. Cantu, was the one looking into Eley, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nCantu created a six-page photo lineup that included a mug-shot image of Eley after researching different names.\n\nAD\n\nPolice said the investigator was able to identify the teen in the video. She met with police on Tuesday and picked out Eley\u2019s mug shot among the lineup of pictures the detective had created, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nThe teen told the detective that she did believe the woman was a police officer and that she and her friends left the park because of their interaction with her, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nThe detective went to Tarrant County Jail to read Eley her Miranda rights and to interview her, but she declined to speak, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nAD\n\nEley was already in custody after being arrested on Monday on a charge of bodily injury assault charge, according to the Tarrant County Correction Center.\n\nAD\n\nShe is being held in custody on $4,000 bond for both charges. If she\u2019s found guilty of impersonating a public servant, she could face up to $10,000 in fines and 10 years of incarceration.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The woman, nicknamed \"Swing Set Susan\" after harassing Hispanic teens playing at Fort Worth, Tex., park, has been charged with a felony.", "authors": ["Lateshia Beachum"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BSZyu7V0cUFe2LaIZFz1hcuJ0MU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SNHUMLZGGBBA5NEW63BS6PTN7Y.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
