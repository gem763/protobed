(Young Kwak)\n\nWashington State quarterback Anthony Gordon passed for nine touchdowns and 570 yards against visiting UCLA on Saturday night.\n\nHe lost.\n\nAt roughly 2:30 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, the highest scoring football game in Pac-12 history effectively ended when linebacker Keisean Lucier-South sacked Gordon, forcing a fumble. Linebacker Josh Woods recovered with 59 seconds left to preserve a 67-63 victory.\n\nUCLA had trailed 49-17 in the third quarter.\n\nGordon\u2019s fumble was Washington State\u2019s sixth turnover.\n\n[Box score: UCLA 67, No. 19 Washington State 63]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Pac-12 After Dark Saturday night win,\u201d UCLA Coach Chip Kelly said afterward during an on-field interview with ESPN.\n\nOh, yes, Chip Kelly. His Bruins scored 25 more points against the Cougars than they had in their first three games of the season combined to help Kelly improve to 1-3 this season and 4-12 in Westwood.\n\nKelly, with 2:38 left and UCLA trailing 63-60, elected to go for it on fourth and five from the Cougars 17 rather than attempting a relatively short tying field goal. Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw an incomplete pass, and Washington State took over on downs.\n\nAnd of course redemption arrived for Kelly when on the Cougars\u2019 ensuing series, when Krys Barnes forced and recovered a fumble by Cougars wide receiver Easop Winston Jr.\n\nFour plays later, Thompson-Robinson completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Demetric Felton for the final margin with 1:07 to play.\n\nThompson-Robinson threw for 507 yards and five touchdowns and ran for 57 yards and two more touchdowns.\n\nThe teams combined for 1,377 total yards.\n\n\u201cGive our guys credit,\u201d Kelly said during his postgame news conference. \u201cSpecial teams contributed. Our offense contributed. The defense came up with key turnovers at good times. It\u2019s a big win for us.\u201d\n\nThompson-Robinson threw touchdowns on four straight possessions to bring the Bruins within a field goal after they had trailed, 49-17, with 6:52 left in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cOur guys got frantic and panicked,\u201d Cougars Coach Mike Leach said. \u201cWe collapsed in every phase of the game.\u201d\n\nGordon\u2019s eighth touchdown pass, breaking the school-record Gardner Minshew set last season, put Washington State back in front, 63-60, with 10:08 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nOh yeah, Minshew took time off from being the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 rookie starting quarterback and emerging cult hero to watch the game from the Washington State sideline.\n\nHe wore a Cougars jersey and jean shorts he said he customized on his own.\n\nRead more:\n\nGeorgia-Notre Dame turned into a defensive slugfest, and the Bulldogs were left standing\n\nCollege football winners and losers: Michigan is mashed, UCF\u2019s run ends\n\nIowa investigating band members claims of abuse by Iowa State fans", "description": "The game featured a 32-point second half comeback and a quarterback who passed for nine touchdowns -- and lost.", "authors": ["Gene Wang", "Sports Reporter Covering Local", "National College Football", "September At Am", "Gene Wang Is A Sports Reporter Covering Multiple Beats", "Including Virginia", "Virginia Tech Football", "Basketball", "The Wizards", "Boxing"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mgis5M1O5tgg57DshXKQloP99ZE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BSQ5A4G5A4I6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
