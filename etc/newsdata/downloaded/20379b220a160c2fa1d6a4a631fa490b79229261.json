Its crumbling British colonial architecture, and street life in particular, provided a rich source of stories and images. Here, a young man sells fruit at a roadside stall beneath a rudimentary striplight (Wainwright is pictured just beyond him, wearing a blue T-shirt). \u201cThere was a specific time at the end of the day, when daylight was failing and the streetlights came on, when everything seemed to glow,\u201d says Levene.\n\nWords by Hannah Booth.\n\nBuy your exclusive print here\n\nPrice\n\n\u00a350, including free delivery\n\nPrints\n\nPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100+ years.
