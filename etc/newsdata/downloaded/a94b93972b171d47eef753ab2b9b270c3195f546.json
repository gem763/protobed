then kicking her out.\n\nAbdoulayr Fall, 34, met his victim at GBar in Liverpool City Centre, where he attended looking for women to have sex with, the court heard.\n\nThe victim woke up later that night to find him on top of her at his flat, where he told her \"be quiet\" when she asked him to stop.\n\nFall later claimed it was consensual sex.\n\nA judge today slammed Fall for the multiple lies he told to police and a jury about the attack at his Crosby home.\n\nThe woman was out with friends before becoming separated and going to the Eberle Street club on her own.\n\nShe had little or no memory of what happened, aside from being raped, during the disturbing incident last year, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nFall, who denied any wrongdoing, stood trial at Liverpool Crown Court in April, forcing his victim to give evidence.\n\nThe woman said she remembered coming around with Fall on top of her and pleading with him: \"Stop and get off me.\"\n\nThe victim told the jury: \"I 100% said stop, get off me, to which he said 'be quiet, be quiet', and carried on.\"\n\nJurors were unable to reach a verdict and a retrial was set for September, with the woman facing another harrowing ordeal.\n\nDays beforehand Fall admitted the charge, but only on a basis of plea, including that the sex was initially consensual.\n\nThis was rejected by prosecutors and a Newton Hearing - a form of mini-trial without a jury, when a judge establishes any disputed facts of a case - was held today.\n\nHowever, Fall decided not to give evidence and Judge Gary Woodhall was asked to instead consider transcripts of the trial.\n\nJudge Woodhall also watched CCTV footage and considered submissions made by prosecution and defence lawyers.\n\nThe judge said he found Fall to be \"a witness completely lacking credibility\", whose version of events \"shifted\" to fit evidence.\n\nFall told police the woman wasn't drunk, then the jury that he didn't think she was, and there were no signs she had been.\n\nJudge Woodhall said it was clear from CCTV the woman was intoxicated, which Fall reluctantly accepted at the trial.\n\nFall told officers it was consensual and he didn't ejaculate, but later admitted he did, when faced with scientific evidence.\n\nHe claimed they had been intimate during a taxi journey to his home, but this account was not supported by the driver.\n\nJudge Woodhall said the victim had no recollection of being at GBar, or going to or being at his flat, until she woke up.\n\nHowever, he said she was a \"highly credible and believable witness\" who didn't speculate on things she couldn't remember.\n\nHe said CCTV showed there a \"limited period\" of contact between the pair, with Fall showing more interest in her than vice versa.\n\nJudge Woodhall said he doubted Fall's claim that she asked to go back to his home, but couldn't be sure that didn't happen.\n\nBut he was satisfied Fall was at the bar looking to pick up a woman for sex and must have realised she was drunk.\n\nThe judge said: \"It must have been obvious she was in a state that would have consequent effects on her ability to consent.\"\n\nHe said Fall could be seen \"steering her towards that taxi\" and there was \"a degree of targeting of the complainant, knowing of her condition and vulnerability\".\n\nJudge Woodhall said the evidence was inconsistent with Fall's claim the woman led the sexual activity and afterwards she described being \"thrown out\", adding to her trauma.\n\nDavid Polglase, prosecuting, said the victim suffered psychological and physical problems as a result.\n\nThe woman said she already suffered from anxiety and depression, but was \"no longer the life and soul of the party\".\n\nShe told the court she didn't want to go out or be alone, blamed herself, and felt embarrassed and scared that she made a fool of herself.\n\nThe woman said she felt like \"her body was there but her mind was not, like a functioning zombie\" when being raped.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nShe found attending a sexual health clinic embarrassing and said the trial was \"harrowing\" and stressful.\n\nThe woman said it was \"awful\" that it was insinuated she was lying and she was \"devastated\" the jury couldn't reach a verdict.\n\nShe added that she suffered nightmares, felt violated and due to taking time off work was made redundant.\n\nMichael O'Brien, defending, said Fall, now living in Melling, was born in Senegal and had no previous convictions.\n\nJudge Woodhall, who said it was rape from the outset, jailed Fall for eight years and 10 months.\n\nHe told him to sign on the Sex Offenders Register for life.\n\nSpeaking after the case, Detective Constable Louise Wright said: \u201cThis is a significant sentence that reflects the horrific ordeal suffered by Fall\u2019s victim on that night. I would like to take this opportunity to commend and thank the victim for coming forward to speak to us and for remaining strong throughout this year-long investigation.\n\n\u201cI hope that knowing Fall has been brought to justice and will spend a considerable amount of time behind bars will now allow her to start moving on with her life.\n\n\u201cI would urge anyone who has been victim of a rape or sexual assault to find it within themselves to tell someone what has happened to them so that they do not continue to suffer in silence. If they come forward and speak to us we will do everything in our power to find the person responsible and put them before the courts.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information or wants to report a sexual offence is asked to call 101 where you will be spoken to by specially trained officers or you can pass information to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.\n\n\n\nSupport for victims is also available through the registered charity the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre Cheshire and Merseyside, who can be contacted on 01925 221 546 or 0330 363 0063 or Rape and Sexual Assault Merseyside (RASA) on 0151 558 1801.", "description": "Abdoulayr Fall, 34, met his victim at GBar in Liverpool City Centre, where he attended looking for women to have sex with, the court heard", "authors": ["Neil Docking", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20744881.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Abdoulayr-Fall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
