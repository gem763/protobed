The complaint was declassified last month, and the White House released a memo summarizing the call that corroborated the complaint.\n\nBut Graham told Axios that he did not consider the call between Trump and Zelensky to be enough evidence of an impeachable offense.\n\n\"I've read the transcript of the Ukrainian phone call. That's not a quid pro quo to me,\" he said.\n\nTrump has also asked other countries to investigate the Bidens. During a June phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump brought up Biden's political prospects, CNN reported earlier this month, citing two people familiar with the conversation.\n\nRead more: Trump suggests Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason amid impeachment inquiry\n\nTrump also made a series of comments on the White House lawn calling on China to investigate the Bidens. \"China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" he told reporters earlier this month.\n\n\"As to asking China to look into Biden, that was stupid,\"\n\nThough Graham has been one of Trump's most loyal GOP allies, his recent comments suggest that his view of Trump may be beginning to slip. Graham has slammed the president's decision to pull US troops out of Syria and called it\n\n\"shortsighted and irresponsible.\"\n\nGraham also told Axios on Sunday that Trump's abandonment of Kurdish allies was \"dishonorable\" and a \"sh-tshow.\"\n\n\"I've got to know him, and I find him to be a handful,\" Graham said of Trump. \"I find him to be an equal opportunity abuser of people. But at the end of the day, he can be very charming and be very gracious, and I'm judging him by his conduct.\"", "description": "Speaking to \"Axios on HBO\" on Sunday, Graham called Trump a \"handful\" and an \"an equal opportunity abuser of people.\"", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b2042941ae6621a008b4ded?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
