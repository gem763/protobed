Kamala Harris' demand that Twitter shut down Trump's account, which the president uses regularly to share his views on a multitude of issues.\n\nZuckerberg said Silicon Valley shouldn't be taking such actions.\n\n\"I generally believe that as a principle, people should decide what is credible and what they want to believe, who they want to vote for,\" he said. \"And I don\u2019t think that should be something that we want tech companies or any kind of company doing.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Harris, D-Calif., claimed Trump was using Twitter to inappropriately criticize an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint regarding the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"The President's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,\" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CNN.\n\nFACEBOOK CEO SAYS HE WON'T FURTHER ANTAGONIZE ELIZABETH WARREN AFTER THREATENING LAWSUIT\n\n\"Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting ... directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be -- his Twitter account should be suspended.\u201d\n\nIn the interview with Perino, Zuckerberg also responded to another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate's criticism of Facebook.\n\nLast week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign account tweeted it had created a \"Facebook ad with false claims\" and submitted it to the social media site's platform, which approved it.\n\nIn that same series of tweets, Warren's team claimed Facebook had \"changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies \u2014 explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.\"\n\nIn a recent live-streamed company meeting, Zuckerberg said that he would \"try not to antagonize her [Warren] further.\"\n\n\"Even when people disagree with what I think would be good to happen in the world, I still want to give them a voice \u2014 that's what we're here to do,\" Zuckerberg told his employees.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe 35-year-old billionaire told Perino it is important for Americans to \"think for themselves\" about what politicians say.\n\n\"Political speech is one of the most scrutinized [forms of] speech that is out there, so that\u2019s already happening,\" he added. \"Our position on this is not an outlier.\"\n\nZuckerberg discussed allegations of anti-conservative bias among tech companies.\n\nWatch the full interview airing Friday at 2 PM ET on \"The Daily Briefing.\"\n\nFOX News' Gerren Keith Gaynor and Sam Dorman contributed to this report.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0has responded to calls for social media companies to curtail\u00a0President Trump's\u00a0activities on platforms such as Twitter.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Zuck-Perino.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
