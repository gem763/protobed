You can start out with easier-to-read, basic books early in your investing career, then progressively move on to more difficult and complex concepts as you get better at investing.\n\nThe three main topics I think intermediate investors should wrap their brains around are (in no particular order of importance): behavioural finance and investment psychology, corporate growth and excellence, and factors that make a business great. Here are three investment books that tackle each of the above topics, geared toward investors who already have some years of investment experience and would like to further their knowledge.\n\nThe Little Book of Emotional Investing by James Montier\n\nThis is a great book for investors who want to understand the many types of fallacies and biases that may plague them during the investment process. Montier provides a list of psychological traits such as overconfidence, confirmation bias, and hindsight bias that regularly trip us up and cause us to make sub-optimal investment decisions.\n\nThe book also highlights the steps involved in the formation of a bubble, and it\u2019s useful in allowing investors to judge the state of the stock market right now, whether exuberant or downbeat. Finally, Montier provides eight dangers of groupthink (i.e., going along with the crowd) and advises us on how to guard against these when investing.\n\nGood to Great by Jim Collins\n\nCollins\u2019 book provides a great platform for analysing what makes good companies become great, while others remain mired in mediocrity. He outlines the essential attributes of such companies, from leadership to process to culture, and teaches readers what to watch for when trying to identify potential future greatness.\n\nI found this book extremely useful in teasing out the differences between \u201cnormal\u201d companies and truly great companies; it also taught me to focus my attention on how great companies are able to sustain a culture of innovation and adaptation that enables them to continually grow and prosper. Investing in such companies also allows an investor to get great returns through compounding.\n\nWhy Moats Matter (Morningstar) by Heather Brilliant and Elizabeth Collins\n\nThis book by global financial services firm Morningstar encapsulates the various types of competitive moats that allow companies to compound shareholder wealth over long periods of time. The book defines what a moat is, provides details on different kinds of moats (e.g., network effect, switching cost, low-cost), talks about moat durability, and also assesses moat trends.\n\nThose who invest in companies with competitive moats should find this book very useful as it defines the characteristics of a sturdy moat and teaches readers how to discern whether the moat is getting stronger or weaker over time. Using the techniques from the book, investors can then make more informed investment decisions and practice continually assessing if their investment theses are still valid, based on their assessment of how the moat evolves over time.\n\nMore reading\n\nThe information provided is for general information purposes only and is not intended to be personalised investment or financial advice.\n\nMotley Fool Singapore 2019", "description": "Investors who would like to deepen their investment knowledge should check out these three useful investing books.", "authors": ["Royston Yang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H_iHHX0p3Eq_7_bavHHpCA--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/motley_fool_sg_653/1680b4795bc2237941b7105b8305ede4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
