Ambassador Kelly Craft and her staff during a private event at the Intercontinental Hotel in New York, according to the L.A. Times, which posted audio from an attendee.\n\n\u201cBasically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, he never saw the call \u2014 heard something and decided that he or she, or whoever the hell they saw \u2026 almost a spy,\u201d Mr. Trump said behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nThe comments caused a firestorm online, with some wondering if Mr. Trump was joking about executing the people responsible for the complaint.\n\nDetails of the complaint were released early Thursday in a letter to the intelligence committee chairmen on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint accurately summarized the July 25 call Mr. Trump held with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and raised concerns that Mr. Trump was leveraging the presidency for personal gain.\n\nPrimarily, it focused on the president\u2019s decision to bring up a possible probe into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe complaint also detailed efforts by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to gather dirt on U.S. Democrats from Ukrainian officials, though the whistleblower \u2014 a non-White House official \u2014 gleaned most of the details secondhand amid inter-agency work.\n\nThe whistleblower alleged that White House officials moved to \u201clock down\u201d the contents of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone conversation with Mr. Zelensky, which seemed to suggest they understood the \u201cgravity of what had transpired in the call,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
