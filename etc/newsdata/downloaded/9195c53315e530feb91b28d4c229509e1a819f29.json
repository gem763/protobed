Changes to the format have been requested by UEFA member federations who want six competitive Nations League games instead of four, and avoid playing friendly games that are less popular, the officials say.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "People familiar with the changes tell The Associated Press that UEFA is looking to expand the Nations League's top tier, which would save Germany and Croatia from relegation after last-place finishes in their groups last season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Graham Dunbar"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
