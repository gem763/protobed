They were filmed shaking hands.\n\nShe explained her absence to popular news website The Paper as being the result of a tight schedule, saying that she went into hospital last week, and then went on a business trip.\n\nShe said that she had recently received a large number of messages on mobile WeChat, and had seemingly missed her landlord's.\n\n\"I will clean now\u2026 I will even clean overnight,\" she told The Paper.\n\nHow have Ms Li's fans reacted?\n\nImage copyright Pear Video Image caption Ms Li returned to clean her apartment\n\nFootage of Ms Li sweeping dog poo into a dustpan has shocked her fans, and led to a large amount of mockery online.\n\nMore than 60,000 users have commented on her page, many saying they were unfollowing her and calling her \"fake\".\n\nMany have also questioned her sincerity in her interviews with mainstream media. Users noted she has changed her social media handle and removed a number of earlier posts.\n\nImage copyright The Paper Image caption Ms Li told The Paper she hadn't seen messages from her landlord\n\nIs this the first time this type of thing has happened?\n\nChina is on a huge drive to push for celebrities to be \"socially responsible\".\n\nIt heavily frowns on influencers not setting a good example to young followers, and has a track record of making examples of such people, arguing that stars need to be good role models and preserve a healthy online culture.\n\nIn July, a Chinese vlogger became the subject of widespread mockery, after a technical glitch during a live-stream revealed her to be a middle-aged woman, and not the young woman she had presented herself to be.\n\nSome \"badly behaved\" influencers have even received short jail terms. In October 2018, Yang Kaili, a live-streaming celebrity with tens of millions of followers, was detained for five days for \"insulting\" the country's national anthem.\n\nThe live-streaming platform she used, Huya, took down her video and banned her channel, saying: \"Live-streaming platforms are not above the law - the law and moral standards similarly apply there.\"\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.
