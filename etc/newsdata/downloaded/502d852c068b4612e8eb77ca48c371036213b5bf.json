A series of capital transfers would make Jio, which already has capital of 650 billion rupees, almost debt free by March 2020, the parent said Oct. 25.\n\nThe move by Asia\u2019s richest man is the latest sign of the oil-to-petrochemicals group\u2019s pivot toward data and digital services for future growth, as it builds an online platform to take on the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.\u2018s Flipkart Online Services Pvt. in India. Ambani, 62, told shareholders in August that the new businesses, including retail, are likely to contribute half of Reliance\u2019s earnings in a few years, versus about 32% now.\n\nWith the new holding firm, Ambani is also readying the businesses for an initial public offering, which he has vowed to complete within five years. Since Jio\u2019s 4G network rolled out in 2016, the carrier has vaulted to the top in India with more than 350 million users. Ambani has also been stitching together a network of partners through acquisitions and stake purchases to build a backbone for his e-commerce plans.\n\n\u201cGiven the reach and scale of our digital ecosystem, we have received strong interest from potential strategic partners,\u201d Ambani said in a statement. \u201cWe will induct the right partners in our platform company, creating and unlocking meaningful value for RIL shareholders.\u201d\n\nReliance Industries will invest the money in the holding company -- likely on the lines of Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. and Alphabet Inc. -- through optionally convertible preference shares. The unit will acquire the parent\u2019s equity investment of 650 billion rupees in Jio, according to Reliance Industries.\n\nFollowing the equity infusion, Reliance Jio will transfer liabilities worth 1.08 trillion rupees to a subsidiary of the parent, turning Jio almost debt free, excluding airwave-related liabilities.\n\nStreamlining Structure\n\n\u201cThe reorganization of Jio\u2019s capital structure is intended at consolidating all digital assets under one entity, reducing debt at this entity and streamlining the structure to make it attractive for eventual monetization,\u201d Citigroup said in a research report.\n\nWhile former English teacher Jack Ma started Alibaba in 1999 from scratch, Ambani is using the heft of his empire to build something similar for India by connecting retailers and consumers. Alibaba, whose market value is $454 billion, reported a profit of $13 billion in the year to March, on a revenue of $56 billion. The Chinese giant\u2019s expansion has included mom-and-pop shops -- a key segment Ambani is also seeking to tap.\n\nShares of Reliance Industries have rallied 28% this year, compared with an 8.8% gain in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index. The stock, near an all-time high, will resume trading Tuesday when India returns from a holiday.\n\nAmbani said in August that Reliance Industries has spent almost $50 billion on Jio, whose entry with free calls and cheap data pushed some rivals to exit or merge in a consolidation that shook up the industry.\n\nJio\u2019s debt stood at about 840 billion rupees as on Sept. 30, Chief Financial Officer V. Srikanth said earlier this month. It had a stand-alone profit of 9.9 billion rupees for the quarter through September on revenue of 123.54 billion rupees.\n\nThe tycoon, whose net worth is about $56 billion as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has also revealed a plan to sell 20% of Reliance\u2019s oil and chemicals business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co. at an enterprise value of $75 billion. After years of spending billions of dollars on the new businesses, Ambani is cleaning up the parent\u2019s balance sheet, with the goal of making it free of net debt in less than two years.\n\n--With assistance from Abhay Singh, Ashutosh Joshi, Teo Chian Wei and Lulu Yilun Chen.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: P R Sanjai in Mumbai at psanjai@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Nagarajan at samnagarajan@bloomberg.net, Dave McCombs\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Mukesh Ambani moved a step closer to creating an e-commerce giant for India, unveiling plans to set up a $24 billion digital-services holding company that would become the main vehicle in his ambition to dominate the country\u2019s internet shopping space.The board of Ambani\u2019s Reliance", "authors": ["P R Sanjai"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p4gZZ7LKgmh7dvp2g1MTKw--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/9ce47599253995c040a59054db79f28d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
