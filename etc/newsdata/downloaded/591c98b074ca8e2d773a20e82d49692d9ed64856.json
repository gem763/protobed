Brown was killed in a shooting days after Guyger was found guilty of murdering neighbor Botham Jean. (Tom Fox/Dallas Morning News/Pool/AP)\n\nA witness who was key to the murder conviction of Amber Guyger, the former Dallas police officer who opened fire on her neighbor Botham Jean in his own apartment, was shot to death 10 days after testifying in the high-profile trial, according to a lawyer representing the Jean family.\n\nJoshua Brown, who lived in the same apartment complex as Jean and Guyger\u2019s and overheard their fatal encounter, was \u201cshot several times by an unknown assailant\u201d on Friday night, civil rights lawyer Lee Merritt said Saturday night on Twitter. Brown was a 28-year-old Lancaster, Tex., native and former University of South Florida football player who ran his own business in Dallas.\n\n\u201cHis murder underscores the reality of the black experience in America,\u201d Merritt wrote. \u201cA former athlete turned entrepreneur \u2014 Brown lived in constant fear that he could be the next victim of gun violence, either state sanctioned or otherwise.\u201d\n\nI just spoke with Joshua Browns mother. She is devastated. We all are. Joshua Brown was key witness in the murder of Botham Jean that helped put Amber Guyger away. We need answers. pic.twitter.com/5BCdkVXoQ4 \u2014 S. Lee Merritt, Esq. (@MeritLaw) October 5, 2019\n\nThe Dallas Police Department has not confirmed that Brown was the man killed, noting that the victim wasn\u2019t carrying identification. In an emailed statement, the department said officers had responded to reports of a shooting just after 10:30 p.m. at Atera Apartments at 4606 Cedar Springs Rd. Merritt said Brown was living there after moving from the South Side Flats, where he, Guyger and Jean resided when Guyger killed Jean in September 2018.\n\nAuthorities arrived at the Atera complex Saturday night to find a man lying on the ground in the parking lot with multiple gunshot wounds. Paramedics took him to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he died of his injuries.\n\n\u201cSeveral witnesses heard several gunshots and observed a silver four-door sedan leaving the parking lot at a high rate of speed,\u201d police said, adding that there are not yet any suspects.\n\nThe fatal shooting came two days after jurors sentenced Guyger to 10 years in prison for the murder of Jean, 26, a St. Lucia-born accountant and church singer. That a white officer had killed an unarmed black man in his home sparked widespread outrage and protests in Dallas.\n\nSome saw Guyger\u2019s conviction as a victory in the national push for police accountability. Her sentence \u2014 on the low end of the 99 years the jury could have given \u2014 prompted criticism from observers and a stunning act of forgiveness from Jean\u2019s younger brother.\n\nBrown\u2019s testimony was crucial to the outcome of the case, Merritt said. Brown took the stand on Sept. 24, the second day of the trial, and told jurors that he was walking toward his unit at the South Side Flats when he overheard what sounded like a surprise meeting between Jean, who lived across the hall from him, and Guyger. He said he couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying but was sure he didn\u2019t hear the loud police commands Guyger later claimed she made.\n\nThat testimony undermined \u201ca key element of the defense,\u201d Merritt said.\n\n\u201cAmber claimed she shouted commands to Botham before shooting him,\u201d Merritt wrote on Facebook. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. No one heard that. No neighbors. No passerby\u2019s. Not Joshua as he walked down the corridor. No one.\u201d\n\nBrown ran when he heard two gunshots ring out. Then, worried about his dog, he headed back toward his unit. Through the peephole in his door, he said, he watched Guyger pacing the hallway and talking on her phone.\n\n\u201cShe was crying,\u201d Brown testified during the trial. \u201cExplaining what happened, what she thought happened. Saying she came into the wrong apartment.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at his lap, wiped his eyes with his T-shirt and reached for a box of tissues as he explained that he had met Jean only once, just hours before the shooting on Sept. 6, 2018. But Brown had often heard him across the hall, singing gospel and songs from the rapper Drake: \u201cI heard him singing every morning,\u201d he said, before asking to take a break.\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp called a recess so Brown could collect himself.\n\nOn Saturday, friends and former teammates reacted to Brown\u2019s death with shock. They told the Tampa Bay Times that he was funny and outspoken.\n\n\u201cHe was a passionate individual,\u201d Kofi Amichia, who played with Brown at the University of South Florida, told the paper. \u201cA guy that always spoke his mind no matter what, and one of the funniest guys at USF. Could make anybody laugh.\u201d\n\nIn a Saturday interview with the Dallas Morning News, the lead prosecutor in the Guyger trial said Brown had been courageous to come forward with what he knew.\n\n\u201cHe bravely came forward to testify when others wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Jason Hermus said. \u201cIf we had more people like him, we would have a better world.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nInside the jury room, an agonizing deliberation to sentence Amber Guyger\n\nAmber Guyger\u2019s 10-year murder sentence sparks both protests and an act of forgiveness\n\nAmber Guyger was hugged by her victim\u2019s brother and a judge, igniting a debate about forgiveness and race", "description": "Joshua Brown lived in the same apartment complex as Guyger and her victim, Botham Jean.
