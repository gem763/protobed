The day after that visit from Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, and House Minority Leader John Rhodes of Arizona, Richard Nixon resigned.\n\nAs impeachment proceedings officially began in the House this week, speculation quickly turned to how they might end in the Senate. Articles of impeachment are drafted and voted on in the House, leading to a trial in the Senate. Unlike in 1974, Republicans now have a Senate majority. It would therefore require at least 20 votes from Donald Trump\u2019s own party to reach the 67 necessary to remove him as president, assuming all Democrats and the two independents all vote to convict.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon says an emotional farewell to his staff and Cabinet after resigning from office in 1974; President Trump.

Thus far, Trump\u2019s reputed stranglehold on the Republican base and his threats to support primary challenges to incumbents who oppose him have kept virtually the entire party in his corner. Rep. Justin Amash, the (very conservative) Michigan Republican, became the exception that proves the rule when he came out in favor of impeachment and was essentially thrown out of the party.\n\nBut it\u2019s good to remember that in the early days of Watergate it had seemed unlikely that Republican minds would change, either. A year before his final trip to the Nixon White House, Goldwater had told Time magazine: \u201cWatergate is the concern of every Republican I talk to. But both conservatives and liberals in the party are ready to stand behind the president.\u201d\n\nHistory similarly records as an act of courage and conscience the question posed in June 1973 in the Senate by Howard Baker Jr. of Tennessee: \u201cWhat did the president know and when did he know it?\u201d In fact, Baker was less interested in getting to the truth than in setting up a defense of Nixon. The question was directed at White House lawyer John Dean, aiming to get Dean to confirm that Nixon did not play a role in either the break-in at Democratic campaign headquarters or the subsequent cover-up. Instead, Dean testified to three dozen discussions with Nixon about that cover-up.\n\nJohn Dean is sworn in before testifying for the second day before the Senate Watergate Committee on June 6, 1973.

Are there more whistleblowers out there? Will future hearings be like the questioning of Dean or more like the stonewalling and theatrics of Corey Lewandowski?\n\nThere is a sociological model known as the cascade effect. A dinner party goes on and on, and finally someone stands up and says, usually with apology, that they must leave. Soon nearly everyone at the table is headed for the door. A lone agitator throws a rock through a window, and soon thousands are rioting. One well-known actress describes sexual abuse at the hands of a prominent Hollywood executive, and soon hundreds of women bring long-buried accusations to light. It can sometimes take a small group, even one person, to say what others are thinking and completely change the public equation.", "description": "Virtually the entire Republican Party is in President Trump\u2019s corner.
