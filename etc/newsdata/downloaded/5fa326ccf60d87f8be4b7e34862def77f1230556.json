When I\u2019m home, then I am with my dogs \u2013 Moses and Roxy.\u201d\n\nShe misses them a lot \u2013 as well as \u201cmy sister, my family \u2013 everything at home.\u201d\n\nShe has willingly given up the comforts of home to do everything she can to ensure that she and other young people in her generation aren\u2019t faced with insurmountable problems caused by a warming planet including food and water shortages, rampant disease and millions of refugees displaced by uninhabitable land who need a place to live.\n\nRELATED: Teen Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Blasts World Leaders at the U.N. \u2014 \u2018How Dare You!\u2019\n\n\u201cI have a lot of people listening to what I am saying, so I am using that platform to try to achieve a change,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very hopeful, all the young people who are a part of the climate change movement,\u201d she says. \u201cThat keeps me going, to see that it actually has made a difference.\u201d\n\nShe keeps going, she says, \u201cBecause there is no second option. I want to make sure that the people in power know that this is something they cannot continue to ignore.\u201d\n\nFor much more on PEOPLE\u2019s Women Changing the World 2019, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\nShe has done that \u2013 and more.\n\nIn March she was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and would have been the youngest to collect the award had she won. (Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali won the prize on Friday for his efforts to resolve conflict with bordering nation Eritrea.)\n\nIn May, she graced the cover of Time magazine, who named her one of the next generation of \u201ctrailblazers\u201d shaping the world.\n\nIn August, she sailed across the Atlantic from England on a zero-emissions sailboat (she doesn\u2019t fly to reduce her carbon footprint) to come to the U.S.\n\nDuring her time on the East Coast, she testified before Congress, urging them on Sept. 18 to \u201clisten to scientists\u201d and do more to become the global leader in tackling the climate crisis.\n\nOn Sept. 20, she led four million people in more than 150 countries worldwide in the biggest climate strike in history.\n\nThree days later, she gave an emotional and impassioned speech at the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York City, telling delegates and world leaders they need to act now to prevent more disastrous hurricanes, wildfires, flooding and drought \u2013 not just for their sakes but for future generations.\n\nUndaunted by the massive criticism thrown at her from everyone from President Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin, she is touring North America.\n\nShe will eventually head to South America, making her way to Chile for a UN climate change conference in December.\n\nShe says she will not stop crusading for a better world until the problem is solved.\n\nIf we don\u2019t do something about it now, she says, \u201cIt will only get worse. My hope is that we can fix it in time.\u201d", "description": "Greta Thunberg Like Any Other Teen In Her Spare Time", "authors": ["Kc Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bmEUPBanCgXgDChdQc0gpg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MTc5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/ff9c9d1399fb1fc8c722c47854a7da1b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
