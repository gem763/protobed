The tuna giant had asked U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen to reduce the fine to $50 million, arguing that a $100 million penalty could bankrupt it because it still faces millions more in potential civil damages.\n\nBut Chen said the court found the company has the assets, the ability to borrow money to pay the fine and legal recourse to ask for an extended payment schedule if it runs into financial trouble.\n\nHe ordered the company to pay $5 million within 30 days and $11 million next year. Starting in 2021, the company will have to make payments of $21 million each year for four years.\n\nBroad collusion\n\nStarKist Co. last year agreed to plead guilty to a felony price fixing charge as part of a broad collusion that included Bumble Bee Foods and Chicken of the Sea.\n\n\"We have cooperated with the DOJ during the course of its investigation and accept responsibility,\" Andrew Choe, president at StarKist, said in a statement. \"We will continue to conduct our business with the utmost transparency and integrity.\"\n\nThe scheme came to light when an attempt by Thai Union Group Chicken of the Sea to buy San Diego-based Bumble Bee failed in 2015, according to court records.\n\nChicken of the Sea executives then alerted federal investigators, who agreed to shield the company from criminal prosecution in exchange for cooperation.\n\nBumble Bee Foods pleaded guilty in 2017 to the same charge and paid a $25 million fine, $111 million lower than prosecutors said it should have been. Prosecutors said they feared putting the financially struggling Bumble Bee out of business with a high fine and agreed to let the company make interest-free payments for five years.\n\nScott Meece, StarKist's general counsel, addressed the court before the sentencing, asking the judge to consider the company's 2,600 U.S. employees.\n\n\"These employees have had this hanging over their heads for a long time,\" Meece said. \"They're worried about what is going to happen to their jobs.\"\n\nMeece said the company will probably have to make cuts and could consider layoffs or relocating its plant from American Samoa to Thailand. SunKist is owned by South Korean company Dongwon Industries.\n\nMore lawsuits in the pipeline\n\nTwo former executives of Bumble Bee and one from StarKist have also each pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges. None of them have been sentenced.\n\nFormer Bumble Bee chief executive Christopher Lischewski has pleaded not guilty to a price-fixing charge.\n\nThe three companies face myriad lawsuits from wholesalers, food service companies and retailers such as Walmart, Target and Kroger.\n\n\"Today's result demonstrates our commitment to enforcing the antitrust laws aggressively against companies that fix prices,\" said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. \"When a corporation cheats customers at the checkout line, the Antitrust Division will hold it accountable to the greatest extent.\"", "description": "The company pleaded guilty to colluding with other tuna packers to keep prices artificially high", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/19/47fe6780-b60b-4303-860f-88c01f55c790/thumbnail/1200x630/2e5f252acf2a2dcb5f1ab4999e945169/starkist-headquarters-pitttsburgh-1018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
