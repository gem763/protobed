It is an issue troubling some of the greatest minds in the world at the moment, from Bill Gates to Elon Musk. SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk described AI as our 'biggest existential threat' and likened its development as 'summoning the demon'. He believes super intelligent machines could use humans as pets. Professor Stephen Hawking said it is a 'near certainty' that a major technological disaster will threaten humanity in the next 1,000 to 10,000 years. They could steal jobs More than 60 percent of people fear that robots will lead to there being fewer jobs in the next ten years, according to a 2016 YouGov survey. And 27 percent predict that it will decrease the number of jobs 'a lot' with previous research suggesting admin and service sector workers will be the hardest hit. As well as posing a threat to our jobs, other experts believe AI could 'go rogue' and become too complex for scientists to understand. A quarter of the respondents predicted robots will become part of everyday life in just 11 to 20 years, with 18 percent predicting this will happen within the next decade. They could 'go rogue' Computer scientist Professor Michael Wooldridge said AI machines could become so intricate that engineers don't fully understand how they work. If experts don't understand how AI algorithms function, they won't be able to predict when they fail. This means driverless cars or intelligent robots could make unpredictable 'out of character' decisions during critical moments, which could put people in danger. For instance, the AI behind a driverless car could choose to swerve into pedestrians or crash into barriers instead of deciding to drive sensibly. They could wipe out humanity Some people believe AI will wipe out humans completely. 'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind's Shane Legg said in a recent interview. He singled out artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number one risk for this century'. Musk warned that AI poses more of a threat to humanity than North Korea. 'If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea,' the 46-year-old wrote on Twitter. 'Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too.' Musk has consistently advocated for governments and private institutions to apply regulations on AI technology. He has argued that controls are necessary in order protect machines from advancing out of human control\n\nMusk has been an outspoken critic of allowing such technology to progress unchecked, branding it a 'fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.'\n\nFor his latest cry, Musk has called out bot swarms.\n\n'If advanced AI (beyond basic bots) hasn't been applied to manipulate social media, it won't be long before it is,' he shared in the first tweet.\n\n'Anonymous bot swarms deserve a closer examination. If they're evolving rapidly, something is up', reads the second tweet.\n\nPope Francis' warning follows Telsa CEO Elon Musks concerns about AI in a pair of tweets (pictured) \u2013 stating it is not long until this technology manipulates social media\n\nThe billionaire suggested sites watch closely to see if bot swarms are evolving faster, as this could be a dead giveaway of a robot takeover\n\nMusk is suggesting that the bot armies could make bot accounts more convincing or effective.\n\nIt is not just artificial intelligence that Musk is worried about -- he worries about a robot takeover.\n\nResponding to footage of a six-foot back-flipping robot released in 2017, the Tesla CEO spoke of the need to control development of AI, or else it could be 'sweet dreams' for mankind.\n\nThe billionaire has been an outspoken critic of allowing such technology to progress unchecked, branding it a 'fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.'", "description": "Speaking at a three-day event, Pope Francis warned Silicon Valley and tech giants in the audience to be ware AI doesn't lead to a new 'form of barbarism', resulting in the manipulation of millions.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/17/19016716-0-image-a-23_1569600307154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
