I didn\u2019t really feel it or hear it at the back end (of the match), so it doesn\u2019t worry me.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sitting up there and we\u2019re going to have a couple of beers tonight and celebrate because the urn is coming home. I\u2019m not sure what the 9,000 people in that stand are doing tonight.\u201d\n\nLyon had Headingley hero Ben Stokes plumb lbw after the missed run-out chance but Australia had used up their reviews to challenge the umpire\u2019s not out verdict.\n\nThe 31-year-old laid on the ground as England completed their win and appeared inconsolable before captain Tim Paine literally picked him up off the turf.\n\nLyon said he was devastated.\n\n\u201cI wear my heart on my sleeve, and playing cricket for Australia means everything for me,\u201d said Lyon, who bowled on in Manchester despite suffering an injury to his bowling hand during England\u2019s first innings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about personal success, but I\u2019ve had some family issues over the past \u2013 my uncle\u2019s quite sick \u2013 so you realise quite quickly it\u2019s just a game. It does impact a lot of people, but mistakes happen.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to drop the run-out or anything like that, but I had him plumb (lbw) next ball. That\u2019s just the game of cricket, you\u2019ve got to pick yourself up and it\u2019s just the way you bounce back.\u201d", "description": "The Manchester crowd did everything to remind Nathan Lyon of his fumbled run-out in the dying moments of England's frenetic Ashes test win at Headingley but for the Australian off-spinner it was just \"white noise\" after the first couple of overs.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427889106&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880S7", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
