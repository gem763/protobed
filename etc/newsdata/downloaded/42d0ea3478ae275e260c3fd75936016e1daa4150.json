His dismissal was explained on the street as linked to his lack of corruption, in contrast to other senior figures, and his refusal to kowtow to the Popular Mobilization Forces, military entities within the Iraqi security forces, some of which have links to Iran.\n\nWhether people knew General Al-Saadi was less important than what he stood for, said Abbas Kadhim, the director of the Iraq Initiative and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who was visiting southern Iraq when the demonstrations started.\n\n\u201cThis was just a spark that unleashed all built-up grievances,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany of the grievances are not about Adel Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government,\u201d he added, referring to Iraq\u2019s prime minister. \u201cBut when you are the prime minister, you have to pay for your mistakes and those of previous leaders.\u201d\n\nAt first, the demonstrations were small, but as the police and security forces responded with violence, they grew and quickly spread. The government made little effort to curb the security forces\u2019 violence, and by Friday the Iraqi Federal Police had warned in a statement that snipers who were not part of the security forces were shooting at both the protesters and the police.", "description": "Protesters demanded an end to widespread corruption.
