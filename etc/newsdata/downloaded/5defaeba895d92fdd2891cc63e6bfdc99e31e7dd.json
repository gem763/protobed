She guards Taiwan's sovereignty and supports the gays. Thank you!\" he said, carrying a sign that read \"only vote for Tsai Ing-wen in 2020\", a reference to January's presidential election.\n\nSame-sex marriage remains illegal in Taiwan's giant neighbour China, which claims Taiwan as its sacred territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under Beijing's control.\n\n\"Taiwan is an independent country with an advanced civil society and a liberal environment. That\u2019s completely different from China,\" said Peng Yuhao, a 24-year-old sales representative.\n\nA small group shouted their support for anti-government protests in Hong Kong, which have roiled the former British colony for the last four months.\n\n\"Taiwan's democracy supports homosexuals. Taiwan's homosexuals support Hong Kong,\" a group of about 50 people chanted.\n\nStill, same-sex marriage has not had an easy ride in Taiwan.\n\nLate last year, Taiwanese voters opposed same-sex marriage in a series of referendums, defining marriage as being between a man and a woman in civil law.
