The First and Second Amendments both are under attack, as are the Senate and the Electoral College, and other counter-majoritarian institutions that form an important part of the American constitutional architecture. The everything-is-racist campaign of the past few years is intended largely to discredit these institutions. Representative Ocasio-Cortez has judged the Electoral College both \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201cscam,\u201d a common view among progressives. Paul Krugman and Will Wilkinson, both writing in the New York Times, have insisted that projects ranging from liberalizing regulations to defending the Bill of Rights are, somehow, racist enterprises. Michelle Goldberg, also writing in the New York Times, dreams of \u201can end of the GOP\u201d for the crime that Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg describes as conspiring \u201cto stop the New America from governing.\u201d Greenberg dreams of an unchallengeable Democratic monopoly on power \u201cliberated from the nation\u2019s suffocating polarization to use government to advance the public good.\u201d\n\nPolarization is what happens when there are two opinions about something. What happens when there is one opinion \u2014 one permitted opinion \u2014 about something is: China, roughly.\n\nThe main reason the modern United States has not, for all its errors and failures, pursued something as destructive as China\u2019s one-child policy is that no one actually has the power to do so.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Williamson", "Nationalreview.Com China-Population-Problem-Shrinking-Work-Force"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
