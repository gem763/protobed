In 2017, it set a goal for clean energy to meet 20% of its energy needs by 2030. However, despite this vast capacity for green power, most Chinese data centers don't use it, the report said.\n\n\"Nearly three quarters of that power comes from coal,\" said Ye Ruiqi, a Greenpeace climate expert, who said that centers' reliance on coal-fired power was mostly due to their geographic location.\n\n\"Most facilities are located on the east coast, near business hubs and away from China's renewable energy capabilities in the center and the west of the country. Out of the 44 data centers we surveyed, only five used clean energy in their mix,\" she said.\n\nChina's data center industry is dominated by domestic players like Alibaba and Tencent, though Apple is currently building a data center in the country's southern Guizhou Province . The joint venture with Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Company will allow the US company to improve the speed and reliability of its services, but also comply with new, tougher cybersecurity laws\n\nJUST WATCHED This solar farm floats atop a flooded coal mine Replay More Videos ...

If renewable energy increased to 30% by 2023, 16 million metric tons of CO2 emissions could be avoided, according to Greenpeace. That's equal to 10 million round-trip transatlantic flights.\n\nBut the Chinese government is aware it needs to act. In 2015, it launched a green data center pilot program. That same year, Alibaba, one of China's largest cloud computing providers, inaugurated a data center near Hangzhou, using solar energy and hydraulic power. It also relies on lake water to cool its servers.\n\nIn the United States, data centers have significantly reduced their carbon footprint. All of Apple's data centers are powered by clean energy, according to the company , and its new center in China will also use some renewable energy.", "description": "China's data centers produce 99 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, says Greenpeace.", "authors": ["Julie Zaugg", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190130120154-china-coal-plant-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
