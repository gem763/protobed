The sisters were on a trip alongside their BFFs, which not only included Malika Huqq and Poosh's COO Sarah Howard, but Larsa Pippen, too.\n\nIn one scene, Larsa and Sarah start to argue after Sarah sees a woman who they don't know crying in the restaurant's bathroom. Larsa responds, \"Who cares? It's not our fault. It's not our problem. I'm not trying to get to the bathroom and get in someone's business.\"\n\nWhen the scene aired, MailOnline say a viewer took to Instagram to write, \"I'm sorry but I'm the caring friend. If I see someone crying, I'll be the first to ask them if they are ok.\"\n\nLara apparently responded, \"Right a friend!!! If I knew them I would have. They were arguing all night. Like I'm not in Turks to counsel anyone I don't know. And we were all drinking so who knows how the night could have ended.\"\n\nAnother viewer then wrote, \"Why didn't she [do that and] mind her business with Jordyn? [Larsa] ran to the Hollywoodunblocked and TMZ. Spotlight seeking groupie.\"\n\nThe troll was referring to Larsa's response to the Jordyn Woods and Khloe Kardashian drama, when she told paparazzi that Kylie Jenner should evict Jordyn from her home.\n\nLarsa responded, \"Actually babe, I'm the one who tried to stop the stories by telling my friends what was going down. They also have called me, told me things about my situation and that's what friends do!!! But I'm in another country watching a couple fight all night long like what does that have to do with us? We're drinking, enjoying my friend's bday trip.\"\n\nLarsa also took to Instagram to defend her actions in the clip. \"I didn't mean to be dismissive to Sarah,' she wrote. '\"I just didn't think we should be getting involved in any type of domestic situation when we're out of the country #KUWTK.\"\n\nI know that @larsapippen is a great friend to Kourt and she has a great heart. Sarah and her are simply different people. But both are good souls #KUWTK \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) October 21, 2019\n\nKhloe also addressed the situation on Twitter, adding, \"I know that @LarsaPippen is a great friend to Kourt and she has a great heart. Sarah and her are simply different people. But both are good souls #KUWTK.\"\n\nSo there you go.\n\nLike this article?
