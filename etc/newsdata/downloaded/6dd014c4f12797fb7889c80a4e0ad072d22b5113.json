And it didn\u2019t involve Beal.\n\nThe Wizards spoiled Oklahoma City\u2019s home opener, 97-85, behind the leading efforts of center Thomas Bryant and rookie forward Rui Hachimura. Bryant paced the Wizards with 21 points and 11 rebounds, logging his second consecutive double-double, and Hachimura added 19 points.\n\nAD\n\nWith about a minute remaining as Thunder fans began moving toward the exits, Bryant yelled to no one but himself, \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe quiet one of this outfit, Hachimura proved again to be more capable than your average rookie, posting his second straight game in double figures on 8-for-20 shooting.\n\nTogether, the soft-spoken Hachimura and the excitable Bryant made for a dynamic tandem.\n\nBryant stepped back for three-pointers. Hachimura recognized mismatches and fearlessly moved around smaller opponents into the paint. Bryant excelled defensively, even while matching up with a bigger center in Steven Adams. Then, with 4:27 remaining and the score tied at 83, the two made clutch plays to power the Wizards\u2019 game-changing run.\n\nAD\n\nHachimura held on to the ball, waiting to find Beal, but finally decided to take control himself and moved past Danilo Gallinari for a hook shot that snapped the tie.\n\n\u201cJust him staying poised and being aggressive,\u201d Bryant said of Hachimura. \u201cSticking to the game plan, day in and day out. Just taking it day by day. He\u2019s not forcing anything. He\u2019s letting the game come to him, and when he sees openings, he\u2019s aggressive with them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn the next defensive possession, Bryant intercepted an entry pass, leading to Davis Bertans pulling up for a transition three-pointer. Moments later, Bryant found Beal cutting to the lane and flexed after the assist. Despite Chris Paul in the Thunder\u2019s lineup, the Wizards had more assists on the night (21-14).\n\nAD\n\nThe 7-0 run catapulted the Wizards to their first win of the season, despite an off night from Beal (7 for 22, 17 points). In two games, Beal has made 14 of 47 attempts.\n\nBryant\u2019s scoring was as necessary as it was timely. Looming large in the background of his strong offensive night was Washington\u2019s expanding injury list. Jordan McRae underwent surgery Friday in New York for a fractured ring finger. McRae scored 11 points in the opener and provides a veteran presence in Coach Scott Brooks\u2019s rotation.\n\nAD\n\nFor a night, they made up for the absence as Bertans (13 points) and Moritz Wagner combined for 20 of the 27 points by the bench. Soon, they will have a steadier supplement with the addition of another seasoned scorer. As the team concludes its trip, Isaiah Thomas expects to make his season debut Saturday in San Antonio.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf everything goes right, then I should be playing tomorrow hopefully,\u201d Thomas said Friday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a goal of mine. I want to, but it\u2019s just [a decision of] the medical staff.\u201d\n\nThomas missed all of training camp and preseason while recovering from surgery on his left thumb. During that time, he watched his new teammates and catalogued some of their weaknesses \u2014 among them, a complementary scorer to Beal. Thomas, who has averaged 18.6 points in his career, knows he can be that partner.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just want to play. I felt really good this summer. I felt really good in September, and then I messed up my thumb,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt was a minor setback, but I mean, I\u2019m ready to play.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNote: The NBA denied the Wizards\u2019 application for a second disabled player exception for Wall, who has been recovering from an Achilles\u2019 tendon injury since February. In January, when Wall required season-ending surgery for a bone spurs issue, the team applied for and was granted the exception. A month later, Wall suffered the Achilles\u2019 injury.\n\nWith the latest decision, a league-appointed doctor examined Wall and did not rule him out for the entire season. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Wall will return this year. While the Wizards like what they\u2019re witnessing from Wall\u2019s workouts \u2014 he looks strong and moves well while going through shooting drills \u2014 they also recognize the benefits of letting him take the season to recover.\n\nRead more from Post Sports:\n\nAD", "description": "Center and rookie forward combined for 40 points in Washington\u2019s 97-85 victory over the Thunder.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/J1Hbn62MHHjn1yE191nHSnuMcnc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6X7YRXXXTQI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
