She would be so proud,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cBless the duke\u2019s heart for following in his mum\u2019s footsteps,\u201d another commented.\n\nFor all the latest news on the royal tour, click here.", "description": "The Duke of Sussex has followed in the footsteps of his mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, by walking through an Angolan minefield.", "authors": ["Sabrina Barr"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/09/harry-diana-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
