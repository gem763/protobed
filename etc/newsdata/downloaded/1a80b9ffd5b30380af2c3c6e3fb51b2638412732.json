He returned his passport, public health care documents and driver\u2019s license to their respective government departments, he says, and destroyed his Australian bank cards.", "description": "Excluded from Australia\u2019s Constitution, Murrumu of Walubara, an Aboriginal man, renounced his citizenship and formed a sovereign nation in the northern reaches of the continent.", "authors": ["Livia Albeck-Ripka"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/world/xxwalubara-profile5/merlin_159047679_a44fdcc8-e85c-45d0-9767-7ef48330da96-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
