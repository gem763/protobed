Delegates of federal council told City Press that Waters and MP Ghaleb Cachalia were amongst those who argued that Maimane take his leave as per the report but the view was defeated.\n\nCity Press last week reported that Maimane allegedly told his close allies that he would resign should Zille win the race as working with her would be untenable for him after their falling out.\n\nThe party is now set to host a policy congress ahead of an elective congress sometime next year.\n\nWhen asked by City Press today if he will be seeking re-election, Maimane said the decision will only be made closer to the time.\n\nMeanwhile Zille was at pains to emphasise that she would be \u201cstaying in her lane\u201d and not interfering unless asked to.\n\nShe had told City Press in an interview on Friday that the position had almost 19 different functions and that she supported a view going into federal council that some of the powers in the position be delegated elsewhere.\n\nAt the press conference this afternoon, Maimane also reiterated that those who had been threatening to walk away from the party in order to form a \u201ctrue liberal\u201d breakaway should do so.\n\nHe said it was impossible to have two organisations in one.", "description": "Former DA leader Helen Zille has made a stunning comeback as she emerged victorious in the race for the party\u2019s new federal council chairperson.", "authors": ["S Thembile Cele"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7949/429fa11f65ed450abde7d312f4d55575.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
