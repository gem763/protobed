(AP) - Minshew Mania meet Anonymous Allen.\n\nTwo young backup quarterbacks with different looks but similar styles have taken over in Jacksonville and Carolina, energizing their teams with back-to-back victories after 0-2 starts.\n\nOn Sunday, Jacksonville\u2019s Gardner Minshew and Carolina\u2019s Kyle Allen will square off looking to extend those streaks.\n\nMinshew, a sixth-round pick out of Washington State, has developed quite a following in Jacksonville since taking over in the season opener when Super Bowl 52 MVP Nick Foles went down with a broken left clavicle.\n\nHe has the highest QB rating (106.9) of any rookie in his first four games in the Super Bowl era while leading the Jaguars (2-2) into a tie for first place in the AFC South. He\u2019s the NFL\u2019s highest-rated QB in the red zone this season, too, completing 8 of 11 passes for 57 yards with five TD passes and no interceptions. Minshew is dealing with a sprained knee , but is expected to start Sunday.\n\nAllen, who went undrafted in 2018, has rescued Carolina from two losses at home to start the season by beating Arizona and Houston on the road after Cam Newton decided to rest his injured foot. Allen is looking to become the first QB to win his first four career NFL starts _ he also won in Week 17 of last year _ since Kurt Warner, although he\u2019ll need to do a better job with ball security moving forward.\n\nThe only major differences between the two young QBs may be appearance and popularity.\n\nMinshew\u2019s face is everywhere these days _ on billboards and T-shirts _ depicting his handlebar mustache. Teammates have even started wearing fake mustaches in the locker room.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help but notice it,\u201d Minshew said of the attention.\n\nOn the other side, the average-looking Allen is still gaining the trust of Carolina fans. He threw four TDs in the win over Arizona, but three fumbles last week against the Texans were some cause for concern.\n\nUnlike Minshew, Allen said he can pretty much go anywhere without being recognized.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty unnoticeable,\u201d Allen said with a smile. \u201cI look like a lot like the rest of the people in this (media interview) room.\u201d\n\nBut both are producing on the field.\n\n\u201cI think you just see guys seeing more young quarterbacks playing,\u201d Allen said. \u201cGuys just letting it go and slinging it on Sundays. It\u2019s been cool to see a lot of young quarterbacks doing really well in the league.\u201d\n\nRUN SUPPORT\n\nBoth QBs are getting plenty of support from their backs, with Carolina\u2019s Christian McCaffrey leading the NFC in rushing and Jacksonville\u2019s Leonard Fournette leading the AFC.\n\nThe Jaguars chose Fournette over McCaffrey in the 2017 draft, taking him fourth overall. The Panthers also liked Fournette but happily settled on McCaffrey at No. 8.\n\nMcCaffrey has thrust himself into the league MVP talk early on, leading the NFL in total yards from scrimmage with three games already of 175 yards or more. Fournette had a career-high 225 yards rushing last week against winless Denver.\n\nWORKING OVERTIME\n\nFournette, McCaffrey and Le\u2019Veon Bell of the New York Jets are the only running backs in the league to play more than 90 percent of their team\u2019s offensive snaps this season. McCaffrey hasn\u2019t missed a snap in three of Carolina\u2019s four games. In fact, the only time he has taken plays off came in the latter stages of Carolina\u2019s 38-20 win over Arizona in Week 3 with the Panthers up three scores.\n\nSUPER MARIO\n\nCarolina\u2019s star pass rusher Mario Addison is thriving after coach Ron Rivera tweaked the defensive scheme. Addison, who is playing defensive end/outside linebacker as the team continues to move toward a 3-4 alignment, has five sacks in the last two games. As a team the Panthers are turning up the pressure with 14 sacks in the last two games.\n\nSTAR STILL SACKLESS\n\nOn the flipside, Jaguars defensive end Yannick Ngakoue, who piled up 29 1/2 sacks during the first three years of his NFL career, doesn\u2019t have one this season. It\u2019s the longest stretch Ngakoue has gone without a sack since a four-game stretch in 2016. Ngakoue has been dealing with a hamstring injury, but insists that\u2019s not an issue. The former Maryland standout is entering the final year of his rookie contract.\n\nHe could have some success Sunday if the Panthers are forced to start sixth-round pick Dennis Daley at left tackle. Greg Little is out with his second concussion of the season, meaning the Panthers must decide between Daley and struggling veteran Daryl Williams at left tackle.\n\nGETTING THEIR KICKS\n\nBoth teams are getting great production from their kickers. Josh Lambo was AFC special teams player of the week, while Carolina\u2019s Joey Slye won the award for the NFC. Lambo is a perfect 10 of 10 on field goal attempts, while Slye is 10 of 11 with an NFL-best four made field goals from 50 yards and beyond.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Mark Long contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Minshew Mania meet Anonymous Allen.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/03/panthers_texans_football_19269_c0-104-2492-1556_s1770x1032.jpg?8ffbaf5e3f834ca5288df6467fe9160f67002e15"}
