This aggressive strategy has led WiseTech to spend $642 million to buy 36 companies with combined earnings of $10 million in five years. But it has allowed the company to report ever-growing revenues. WiseTech provides guidance on a revenue and EBITDA basis.\n\nThe market has rewarded WiseTech by bidding up its valuation and brokers have embraced the ease with which WiseTech can make itself even more valuable by buying revenue from other businesses.\n\nBut a roll-up strategy is partly why many investors have avoided the stock and short-sellers have bet against it.\n\nIn June 2018, then Credit Suisse analyst Lucas Goode described it as \u201cthe most expensive software stock in the world on a revenue multiple\u201d.\n\nGoode, who has since joined Investors Mutual, said those \u201cfollowing the Australian market from afar would be wondering how a niche provider of workflow automation software for freight forwarders with good-but-not-great organic growth and relatively unsophisticated software architecture was worth [then] $5 billion and traded at double the valuation of US software companies\u201d.\n\nHe recommended selling the stock into the forthcoming result, but its valuation has since doubled. Today, WiseTech is worth over $10 billion \u2013 that's more than the market's other tech favourite Afterpay, funds management giant Magellan and even casino operator Crown.\n\nWiseTech has made its investors rich, but has come to embody what many believe is a bubble in Australian growth stocks, which trade at almost double the premium of global stocks that are growing earnings at similar rates.\n\nThe debate around WiseTech is whether its strategy of buying other software companies in a niche area has truly created the value ascribed to it by the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavvy growth investors have come to appreciate the attractive economics of software companies able to grow their sales and expand their margins at a rate which justifies what value investors would describe as ludicrous valuations.\n\nSoftware smarts\n\nKate Howitt of fund manager Fidelity explained this at Thursday's Morningstar conference.\n\n\"The true software companies \u2013 if they want to double their sales they don't have to build a second widget factory, they develop the software and they can sell it to twice the number of people and that's twice the revenue with no marginal cost,\" she explained.\n\n\"Most of the cost that they are incurring now \u2013 and this is particularly true of WiseTech \u2013 is to develop functionality for the future, to entrench their strength and their positioning.\"\n\nWhite, she said, \"is on a mission to make sure that no one else can compete with him or replicate what he is doing\".\n\nFor Howitt and Fidelity, WiseTech has been a tremendous success \u2013 a so-called ten-bagger.\n\nThe fund manager acknowledged the valuation had got ahead of itself, and that the portfolio has trimmed its position, but the potential for these firms to grow into the future has to be considered, she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShort-sellers have questioned whether WiseTech really is investing in future growth in the way that other software companies do, and whether the revenue it acquires can grow at the same rate demanded by its valuation.\n\nOne foreign hedge fund manager describes WiseTech as \u201cthe most utterly stupid thing we will ever see in Australian markets in our careers\u201d, but that the joke was on him as he\u2019d shorted the shares since they traded at $7. They last traded at $30.\n\nLingering scepticism\n\nAnother fund manager who specialises in technology stocks said the JCap report called out what local sceptics have been thinking for some time: aggressive capitalisation of costs and R &D, poor disclosure of organic growth and a highly aggressive and opaque roll-up strategy.\n\nBut there does seem to be some disagreement among WiseTech sceptics.\n\nThey are unconvinced by the JCap allegation that the revenues are inflated, and expect the company to refute this claim. Instead, they believe the market is failing to appreciate the capital intensity involved in generating revenue growth where customisation is often required.\n\nNow the ball is in WiseTech's court, and it is expected to respond forcefully. But JCap's work will ignite a simmering debate as to whether Australian investors are ignorant or innovative when it comes to new economy stocks.", "description": "The rise of WiseTech has been met with bewilderment by those that didn't buy the story.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_682%2C$y_68/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ef23c9b0fdf09c92773e9bc8dda323f65724e308", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
