This is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at the facts of this, the ones that you know, you will see there\u2019s absolutely no proof of this at all,\u201d Mr. Whelan added. \u201cThis is a dog and pony show. It\u2019s a kangaroo court. And it just continues. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nVideo of the outburst caught Mr. Whelan raising his voice to make it heard over a judge speaking increasingly loudly in Russian.\n\n\u201cI can actually speak louder than you, your honor,\u201d said Mr. Whelan.\n\n\u201cMy cousins in English would say that, \u2018This is bollocks. It\u2019s total bollocks\u2019,\u201d Mr. Whelan added.\n\nThe hearing was held to consider an appeal filed on behalf of Mr. Whelan after the court ruled last month to extend his pre-trial detention through October 29, 10 months and a day since his arrest at a Moscow hotel.\n\nRussian authorities claim Mr. Whelan was caught \u201cred-handed\u201d possessing a flash drive containing classified information. Defense lawyers previously said he expected to receive photographs of Russian churches, and the U.S. Department of State has complained that Moscow has failed to produce any evidence to support holding him as a spy.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in court Tuesday, Mr. Whelan said that he had been slipped something moments before his arrest by a known member of the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to give you details but I can say that I was set-up,\u201d Mr. Whelan told reporters. \u201cI did not commit a crime. I went to the Kremlin in the morning on a tour. I came back to change to go to a wedding. A person turned up in my room, put something in my pocket and then I was arrested. That person is an FSB officer. It\u2019s someone I\u2019ve known for 10 years. There is absolutely no reason that person should have been in my room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is an absurd provocation. No evidence of crime exists,\u201d Mr. Whelan told reporters.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nMr. Whelan faces a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment in Russia if convicted of espionage.\n\nBipartisan resolutions introduced last month in the House and Senate each urge Russia to provide evidence of Mr. Whelan\u2019s alleged wrongdoing or release him from custody, meanwhile. Combined they currently have 15 co-sponsors.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
