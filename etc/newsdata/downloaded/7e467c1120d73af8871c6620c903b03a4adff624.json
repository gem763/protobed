His business career is also likely to come under close scrutiny during the confirmation process in the European Parliament.", "description": "Macron loyalist will get the same portfolio as president\u2019s first candidate Sylvie Goulard, Elysee insists.", "authors": ["Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1169506698-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
