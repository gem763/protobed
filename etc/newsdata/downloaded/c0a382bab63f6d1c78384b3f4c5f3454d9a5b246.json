(Picture: AMC)\n\nAlpha has come across as one of the most powerful and fierce leaders we have seen so far on the AMC saga.\n\nHowever, it appears she has taken a turn, ever since losing her baby girl Lydia to The Hilltop.\n\nIn episode two, we see her still clinging on to Lydia\u2019s toy bunny, as well as trashing her home when asked by Beta if she misses her.\n\nAlpha then goes onto spare Frances, who started to attract attention from the walkers when she cried over losing her son.\n\nInstead of killing the mourning mother, she gave her a hug and let her free \u2013 however Frances still ended up dead when attacking Alpha later on in the eventful hour.\n\nWhere does Alpha go in the middle of the night?\n\nWhere does Alpha go on her own? (Picture: AMC)\n\nAlpha and Beta had a heart to heart in the woods when he caught her still holding onto Lydia\u2019s teddy.\n\nHowever, he let slip that his co-leader tends to sneak off in the middle of the night on her own.\n\nAnd now we have all the questions as to where she goes.\n\nIs she spying on our people? Or is she going to check up on Lydia? Does she know that the Alexandrians have crossed the border?\n\nWe sure hope that this wasn\u2019t just a fleeting comment, and we\u2019ll find out where Alpha has been taking herself off to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill there be an uprising in the Whisperers?\n\nWill there be an uprising? (Picture: Fox)\n\nBefore Frances was mauled by a herd of zombies, she pounced onto Alpha and tried to take her down while they were out traveling.\n\nHowever, despite being Gamma\u2019s sister, the Whisperers managed to free their leader and left the traitor on the floor to be eaten by the dead.\n\nBut just moments before, the mum had been having conversations with her group about what they saw at The Hilltop, and how they could escape and live there.\n\nAlpha tried to portray the civilisation as a dream, but we can\u2019t help but feel that the Whisperers won\u2019t try and fight for their freedom.\n\nAfter all, how long can you walk around with the skin of the dead on your face?\n\nLet\u2019s hope that Frances didn\u2019t die in vain.\n\nWill Gamma usurp Alpha?\n\nWill Gamma try and usurp Alpha? (Picture: AMC)\n\nGamma seems pretty dedicated to the Whisperers right now, however, will she want to avenge her sister\u2019s death?\n\nThere\u2019s part of us that thinks she is going along with the whole charade in order to take down Alpha and free her people.\n\nAnd while she might have a motive with her sister\u2019s death being at the hands of the show\u2019s villain, Gamma also appears to be power-mad.\n\nAlpha has clearly taken a shine to her, in an attempt to replace the hole left by Lydia, but could Gamma use this trust this to her advantage?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe don\u2019t trust the character one bit, and in our opinion, neither should Alpha.\n\nWas Beta a dad?\n\nAlpha was mourning the fact that her child, Lydia, had gone off with another group, and started to destroy her settlement in the woods.\n\nAnd while she was trashing her house, the episode then shot to a flashback of Beta reacting the same way in an abandoned asylum.\n\nIt was the first time Beta had met Alpha and while she was ushering him to walk with her among the zombie\u2019s he explained how he couldn\u2019t leave a body on the floor.\n\nWho this person is wasn\u2019t made clear in the episode, however, the similarities to both his and Alpha\u2019s breakdown makes us almost convinced it was his child.\n\nUnable to leave his son/daughter behind, Beta then cuts off the skin from his child\u2019s face and appears to have used it as his mask ever since.\n\nWill Carol kill Alpha?\n\nWill Carol kill Alpha? (Picture: AMC)\n\nWhile Carol didn\u2019t play a huge part in the episode, the final scene shows her looking down on Alpha when stood on a cliff.\n\nIt seems this might be foreshadowing a battle between the two characters \u2013 and we are team Carol!\n\nAfter Alpha killed her adopted son Henry in season 9 (not only killed but tortured and beheaded) our original champ has had a vendetta against the new villain.\n\nStaring down at Alpha, it seems Carol is plotting her revenge, which in all honesty, has been a long time coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears the Whisperers have a lot more to give in the upcoming episodes, but will they be gone by the end of season 10? Or even integrated with our original crew?\n\nThe Walking Dead season 10 continues Sunday in the US, with episodes releasing Mondays on Fox in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
