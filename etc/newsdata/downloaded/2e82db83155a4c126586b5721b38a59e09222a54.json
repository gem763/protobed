As they cradled their newborn, everyone was in awe.\n\nAaron (Danny Miller) was overjoyed for his mum, who told him she wanted to be there for him at Robert Sugden\u2019s (Ryan Hawley) hearing \u2013 but he told her she needed to focus on the baby. And Bear Wolf (Joshua Richards) was uncharacteristically moved as he held his grandchild.\n\nDespite all of the carnage going on elsewhere in Yorkshire, with Cain (Jeff Hordley) and Moira (Natalie J Robb) almost being killed in a boat explosion on the lake, spirits were high in the Woolie as everyone celebrated the birth of a new Dingle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell everyone except Mandy (Lisa Riley), who was so knackered from her dancing, singing and crowbarring that she fell asleep in the aftermath.\n\nAs Paddy and Chas found a moment alone, they marvelled at their new arrival and knew that Grace would be in love with her sister. After such a tough and horrendous year for the couple, it\u2019s warmed hearts to see them smile and bask in some joy for a change.\n\nAnd in coming scenes, they will be discussing names for their daughter \u2013 with Bear providing some surprise inspiration for the couple.\n\nThe scenes of joy however, will be juxtaposed by scenes of loss for Aaron as he sees Aaron in court and watches the man he loves be sentenced for the death of Lee Posner.\n\nAs he faces up to life without Robert, can Chas be there for him?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "They had been expecting a boy.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22_10_emm_chas_marlon-c457_1571856365.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
