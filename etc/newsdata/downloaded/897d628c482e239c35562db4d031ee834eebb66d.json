It\u2019s even more difficult when it\u2019s in from of the rest of the world, but I\u2019ll be fine.'\n\nStating that she had the support of her pals, she continued: 'I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ve got a really close group of girlfriends, they\u2019ve been really looking after me.'\n\nWhen asked whether her DMs were full now she's single again, India laughed: 'Maybe they\u2019ll be a bit more full now!'\n\nHowever, the beauty, who reached the final three of Love Island 2019 with Ovie, felt a little hesitant after being single again for the first time in months.\n\nGorgeous: India's raven locks cascaded over her shoulders in bouncy curls, while she added a glam palette of make-up to her face\n\nShe said: 'I feel like I\u2019ve been dropped back in the ocean. We\u2019ll see.'\n\nWhile India dazzled on the red carpet and gave an update into her romance woes, her ex Ovie was also at the event, but avoided posing for snaps and thus avoided India too.\n\nHe did however find time to greet his fans as his Instagram stories show him signing dozens of autographs.\n\nMeanwhile, the sportsman was also seen enjoying the night with his Love Island pal Amber Gill, who he sat next to at the event.\n\nTheir attendance comes after a source has told MailOnline that India and Ovie came to an 'amicable' decision to end their brief romance due to conflicting schedules.\n\nTough: Obviously it\u2019s difficult, but any break-up is difficult. It\u2019s even more difficult when it\u2019s in from of the rest of the world, but I\u2019ll be fine'\n\nThe former lovebirds were thought to be on the rocks over the last few weeks after having rarely been seen together following heavy cheating speculation on both ends.\n\nThe couple finished third on Love Island in July, after striking up a romance just weeks before the series came to an end.\n\nJust days ago, rumours surfaced claiming Ovie had got close to Maya Jama however he hit back at the claims.\n\nHe said: 'You know what\u2019s joke? I\u2019ve never met Maya. I\u2019ve never met her in my life. I swear to God, I\u2019ve never met her in my life...\n\nMoving on? When asked whether her DMs were full now she's single again, India laughed: 'Maybe they\u2019ll be a bit more full now!'\n\nHey guys: Ovie avoided an awkward run-in with his ex as he skipped the red carpet pictures and signed autographs for fans instead\n\n'They did filming for the very last [Love Island spin-off] Aftersun, which was at the villa, where she was there with two other talents and the whole cast we\u2019d sort of shot... I think it was like a promo.\n\n'You know she was standing outside a door but, no. Never met her in my life.'\n\nLast month Ovie was forced to hit back at claims that India had cheated on him with footballer Kieran Gibbs, 29, at his birthday party in Ibiza.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with MailOnline the basketball player said: 'Me and India are happy. I think that's definitely the most important thing. We're very happy.\n\n'Regardless of how many people [there are] in every one of our lives, there will be opinions. And everyone can have their own opinion.'\n\nFun night: Meanwhile, the sportsman was also seen enjoying the night with his Love Island pal Amber Gill, who he sat next to at the event\n\nAll over: The former lovebirds were thought to be on the rocks over the last few weeks after having rarely been seen together following heavy cheating speculation on both ends\n\nSpeaking of the cheating claims, India added to MailOnline: 'We've had a week of nightmare things. There was one [rumour] last week and then yesterday there was another. Can we have a break? Can we just live, please?\n\n'We've been absolutely fine, but obviously it's not nice. The worst thing is \u2013 something coming out in the paper is one thing, we know it's not true and we can just get over that \u2013 but it's all the people on Instagram that start sending you horrible messages.'\n\nClarifying the situation, she explained: \u2018I\u2019ve known Kieran and his brother for years and it was their 30th birthday so I was there with loads of friends and family. There\u2019s nothing about it! It got blown into a ridiculous thing.\u2019\n\nMaura Higgins and Curtis Pritchard, as well as Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury, are the only remaining couples from this year's Love Island.", "description": "The Love Island beauty, 28, stunned in a burgundy off-the-shoulder gown as she discussed her 'difficult' split from boyfriend Ovie Soko at the\u00a0Pride of Britain Awards at the Grosvenor House hotel on Monday.", "authors": ["Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/00/20305234-0-image-a-84_1572310150916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
