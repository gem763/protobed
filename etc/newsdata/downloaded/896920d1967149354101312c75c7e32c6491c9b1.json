Started in the early \u201870s by Ralph Nader, the group is known for its liberal-minded crusades on such unglamorous topics as campaign finance reform and consumer safety.\n\nBut for some period of time over the past few years, Public Citizen found its website being categorized as\u2014well\u2014porn by an internet filtering service used by a major government agency.\n\nSince April, Public Citizen has been in litigation with the Department of Education over what it claims to be a violation of its First Amendment rights. At issue was a truly bizarre and unexpected revelation that took place earlier in the year when officials with the group visited the department to discuss separate matters.\n\nAttempting to access their own website from the Department of Education\u2019s WiFi network, Public Citizen attorneys realized they were being blocked from doing so, with a note popping up that said accessing www.citizen.org was \u201cin violation of your Internet usage policy\u201d\n\nAt first, they thought it was a bit of vindictiveness from a department whose secretary, Betsy Devos, they had been targeting\u2014an attempt by the agency to use control over its network to silence critical voices.\n\nIn February, they filed a Freedom of Information Act request for more information, but that proved unsuccessful. So they filed a lawsuit instead. And in the course of litigation they discovered the actual answer to the blackout: the Department\u2019s web filtering company was categorizing them as an \u201cadvocacy organization\u201d\u2014which they are\u2014and, for some inexplicable reason, advocacy organizations were being placed under the \u201cadult/mature content\u201d categorization, right alongside porn and gambling.\n\n\u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d said Nandan Joshi, Public Citizen\u2019s lawyer.\n\nThe company responsible for all this is Fortinet, which provides network and content security to companies and government entities. According to federal procurement data, Fortinet has done work for a host of government agencies\u2014including the Defense Department, the Interior Department, the State Department, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is unclear from that data what services it provided beyond information technology and security products. But for the Department of Education, the company\u2019s role was to ensure that unsavory or problematic content could not be accessed from its network.\n\nTo do that, Fortinet applied (as it does for other clients) classifications for specific websites and then broader categories to those specific classifications.\n\nWhat methodology it uses for this is unclear. But when Public Citizen became privy to it months into the legal process, it struck the folks there as decidedly confusing. According to its own database, Fortinet listed Public Interest Research Groups\u2014which, like Public Citizen, is a liberal-minded interest group\u2014as a \u201cGeneral Organization\u201d as opposed to an advocacy organization. More confusing was why Fortinet decided that so-called \u201cadvocacy groups\u201d needed to be placed under the adult/mature content category at all.\n\nIn search of a resolution, the Department of Education first informed Public Citizen that it was \u201cwhitelisting\u201d its website so that it no longer got caught up in their security filters. When Public Citizen became more fully aware of what was happening with those filters, they sought to have Fortinet take \"advocacy organization\u201d out of the \u201cAdult/Mature\u201d content category.\n\nDepartment of Education agreed to ask Fortinet not to block advocacy groups on the Department\u2019s networks. And, as a result, Public Citizen announced on Thursday that it was dropping its lawsuit against the department. But even though the group is no longer bringing legal action, Joshi said they weren\u2019t exactly satisfied. There was, he noted, no way to know if other groups were also having their website blocked because Fortinet was listing them as \u201cadvocacy organizations\u201d and, therefore, subjecting them to the \u201cadult/mature\u201d filter. They are calling on the company to simply end the practice of putting advocacy organizations under that categorization.\n\n\u201cIt is possible this problem still exists but we just don\u2019t know about it,\u201d said Joshi. \u201cIt is a little bit scarier in that the effects are broader. Some web filterer decides to do a classification and all the sudden voices are silenced.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Lachlan Markay", "description": "No one thinks the citizen advocacy group Public Citizen is racy.
