Friendlier to the schnoz, if you will.\n\nSure, they provide some pretty good coverage and protection from the sun, but the pricks are wind-pollinators, so the springtime windy season for Melb means that they also turn a whole chunk of city-dewllers into a giant blocked up sinus.\n\nAs per the council\u2019s big, 20-year plan, any tree on its way out or obstructing a building or other city infrastructure will be removed and replaced by native trees and other international plants.\n\nTo be able to reduce the amount of plane trees in the city down to the 5% mark to align them with ever other species in the city, it\u2019s looking like the council will have to remove and replace up to 1400 trees a year. That\u2019s a whole lot of gardening.\n\nThe city is also looking to plant an extra 3000 plants and trees around the city during the plane tree removal period, in attempts to offset the heat that a big ol\u2019 cluster of concrete creates, and drop the city\u2019s temperature by around 4 degrees.\n\nREAD MORE Some Absolute Shit Has Painted Swastikas On Melbourne's Beloved Nylex Clock\n\nThough the council hasn\u2019t confirmed whether the replacement plants will be more hayfever-friendly, surely it\u2019s going to make existing in Melbourne in springtime a hell of a lot easier for everyone\u2019s allergies.", "description": "The Melbourne City Council has announce it'll be removing and replacing the hayfever-inducing London Plane Trees in the CBD over the next 20 years.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/melbourne-yarra-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
