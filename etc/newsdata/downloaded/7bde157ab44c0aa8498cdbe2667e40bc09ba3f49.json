My answer is clearly no,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStill, Le Maire said he was not opposed to the creation of a digital currency, which he said France could develop \"in a European framework\".\n\n\n\n\"The right answer is not a private digital currency under the control of one of the largest multinationals on the planet,\" he said, referring to Facebook's more than two billion users.\n\n\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) economies, which met in Washington on Thursday, announced that a legal framework was a non-negotiable condition for \"stablecoin\" cryptocurrencies, which are backed by other reserve assets.\n\n\n\nSo long as legal, regulatory and oversight risks have not been resolved to their satisfaction, the G7 will not permit stablecoins to enter circulation, the French G7 presidency said in a statement.\n\nMurky regulatory waters\n\nLast month, Le Maire said the European Union should create a common set of rules for virtual currencies, largely unregulated by the bloc at present. He also called for Libra to be blocked in Europe.\n\nIn the absence of specific regulations, EU officials are assessing whether existing rules governing financial instruments could apply, but have so far reached no conclusion.\n\nHowever, new EU-wide rules came into force last year to increase checks on virtual currencies' trading venues with the purpose of reducing risks of money laundering and other financial crimes.\n\nEarlier on Friday, an international monitoring agency warned of \"new risks\" from Libra and other virtual currencies.\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force said these currencies are being \"closely monitored\" to ensure they are not used to finance violent campaigns or launder money.\n\nFacebook announced the launch of Libra in June, saying the digital coin will come online in the first half of 2020 if regulators in Switzerland, where the new currency is to be based, give the go-ahead.\n\nThe social media giant has created a management tool it has named Calibra, which will offer digital wallets to save, send and spend Libras.\n\nIt will be connected to the billion-plus users of the Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp platforms as the network expands beyond social networking into the world of international finance.", "description": "French economy minister says the virtual currency threatens national sovereignty and has 'no place on European soil'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/18/bc9d09549bf04ab4b8119dd8ade9dce1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
