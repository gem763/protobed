The Kurds will never trust America again. They will look for new alliances or independence to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nIn August, the US and Turkey came to an agreement to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d in northern Syria, by which US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would pull back from the border. Ankara sees the SDF as indistinguishable from Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey and views it as a serious security threat. The safe zone deal was due to forestall a Turkish military offensive.\n\nIn the White House statement issued just before 11 pm on Sunday, however, that agreement was not mentioned.\n\n\u201cToday, President Donald J Trump spoke with President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey by telephone,\u201d the surprise statement said. \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the Isis territorial \u201ccaliphate,\u201d will no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d\n\nThe statement suggested that in return for US acquiescence in a Turkish offensive, Erdo\u011fan had assured Trump that Turkey would take over the detention of Isis militants captured by the SDF, on the battlefield. The custody of Europeans and other foreign fighters has long been one of Trump\u2019s preoccupations, and he has lambasted European governments for not taking responsibility for their own nationals in Isis ranks.\n\n\u201cThe US government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured Isis fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused,\u201d Friday night White House statement went on. \u201cThe US will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all Isis fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial \u201ccaliphate\u201d by the United States.\n\nSyria experts warned that the US abandonment of the SDF would lead to another, new front in the eight-year Syrian conflict, and could push the Kurds into seeking an arrangement with the Assad regime in Damascus.\n\nTwo weeks ago, at the UN general assembly, the US special envoy for the global coalition to defeat Isis, Jim Jeffrey, stressed that the US had an agreement with Turkey on a safe zone, in recognition of Ankara\u2019s security concerns, that obviated the need for an Turkish incursion.\n\n\u201cWe listen to the Turks\u2019 concerns. We try to respond to them when we can,\u201d Jeffrey said. \u201cAnd we have made it clear to Turkey at every level that any unilateral operation is not going to lead to an improvement in anyone\u2019s security \u2013 not Turkey\u2019s, not the people in the north-east, not the people around the world who feel threatened by Daesh [Isis], which is the basic purpose for our US military being in the north-east in the first place.\u201d\n\nAnother outcome of the Trump-Erdogan call, is that the Turkish leader is expected to visit the White House next month.", "description": "White House reveals sudden shift in policy, which follows conversation between Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b99c8cd0fe18e237cfa429bef482628642e00de2/0_308_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a799b23d3f327ce7010402c1d1523bb", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
