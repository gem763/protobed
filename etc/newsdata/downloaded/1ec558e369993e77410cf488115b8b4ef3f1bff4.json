According to the indictment, the site claimed more than a million downloads of child exploitation videos by its users.\n\nEach user received a unique bitcoin address to create an account on the website. An analysis of the server revealed that the website had more than one million bitcoin addresses, signifying that the website had capacity for at least one million users.\n\nA forfeiture complaint was also unsealed today. Law enforcement was able to trace payments of bitcoin to the Darknet site by following the flow of funds on the blockchain. Separately, Chainalysis said it was their Chainalysis Reactor software used to analyze the blockchain transactions.\n\nThe virtual currency accounts identified in the complaint were allegedly used by 24 individuals in five countries to fund the website and promote the exploitation of children. The forfeiture complaint seeks to recover these funds and, ultimately through the restoration process, return the illicit funds to victims of the crime.\n\nChainalysis said that with the site\u2019s listed bitcoin address, IRS Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations were able to use Chainalysis Reactor to analyze transaction activity and build a graph showing the flow of funds in and out of the WTV address.\n\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) processes enabled many of the exchanges involved to provide investigators copies of identification, addresses, and other relevant transactions associated with those accounts. In cases where that was insufficient, account information combined with open source intelligence and standard investigative techniques were enough to identify users.\n\nChainalysis said in a statement:\n\n\u201cWe want to enable an entire economy powered by cryptocurrency, but sites like WTV destroy the public\u2019s faith in the technology and slow down adoption in the legitimate economy. Fighting against them is a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAssistant Attorney General of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, Brian Benczkowski, said:\n\n\u201cDarknet sites that profit from the sexual exploitation of children are among the most vile and reprehensible forms of criminal behavior. This Administration will not allow child predators to use lawless online spaces as a shield.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Wednesday, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie K. Liu said:\n\n\u201cOur message for those who produce, distribute and receive child pornography is clear: you may try to hide behind technology, but we will find you, and we will arrest and prosecute you.\u201d\n\nOn March 5, 2018, agents from the U.K., and Korean National Police in South Korea arrested Son and seized the server that he used to operate a Darknet market that exclusively advertised child sexual exploitation videos available for download by members of the site.", "description": "A U.S. federal grand jury indicted a South Korean citizen for operating a child porn site, funded by millions dollars worth of bitcoin.", "authors": ["David Pan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4tM.VUersPpk0Li2.rwVOg--~B/aD02Njc7dz0xNTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/4fbb50ca8394c7950bdb1a44dd6ed2dc", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
