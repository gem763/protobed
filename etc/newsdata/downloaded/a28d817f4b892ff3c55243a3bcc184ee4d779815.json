I mean why else would you stop production of the most popular rifle in America? The recent spate of mass shootings has caused the anti-gun Left to resurface its ugly head\u2014and they\u2019re scoring wins, folks. In Florida and Vermont, two A-rated NRA governors, Rick Scott and Phil Scott signed terrible pieces of legislation into law after the Parkland shooting. Rick Scott, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2018, increased the age to buy all firearms, including long guns, to 21 before he left the governor\u2019s mansion. Phil Scott signed laws that banned so-called high capacity magazines and expanded background checks. At the state level, the anti-gun Left is building support. We need to be vigilant. Now, we have this kidney punch from Colt saying it's ending production of the AR-15 rifle for civilians. In a statement, the firearms maker said it will focus on meeting rifle demands for the military and law enforcement, adding that its decision to end AR-15s for civilians was due to the fact that the market already had a solid supply available (via AP):\n\nColt\u2019s chief executive officer, Dennis Veilleux, says it is not permanently ending production but believes there is already an adequate supply of sporting rifles on the market. He said in a statement Thursday the company will concentrate on fulfilling military and law enforcement contracts with its rifle manufacturing. The West Hartford, Connecticut-based company has received some criticism from gun rights advocates for moving away from the civilian market. Veilleux said in the statement the company remains committed to the Second Amendment and is adapting to consumer demand.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Wouldn\u2019t Colt want a piece of the uptick that\u2019s bound to happen given that Democrats have adopted explicit gun confiscation policies? Whatever the case, this will be used by the Left to fundraise and fill their coffers. And while Colt may not see this as caving to anti-gun pressure, it will be seen that way. Very disappointing.\n\nNEWS: #Colt will stop making AR-15 for consumer market, saying demand for the rifle is waning and there's too much supply on the market to justify making more. https://t.co/g5gPb7vES4 pic.twitter.com/babo2fTWjv \u2014 93 WIBC Indianapolis (@93wibc) September 19, 2019", "description": ".09/19/2019 19:02:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/311/37475148-ac7b-484f-aeca-76896676a8b9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
