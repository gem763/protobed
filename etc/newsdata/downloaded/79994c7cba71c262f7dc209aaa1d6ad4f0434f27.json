The team benched Manning coming off their second straight loss.\n\nGiants coach Pat Shurmur left the door open for Jones, the sixth overall pick, when speaking to reporters Monday. In Week 2, the 38-year-old Manning threw for 250 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nJones\u2018 selection was heavily criticized when drafted, but the Duke product impressed in the preseason. Now, he will get an opportunity to make his mark in the NFL, beginning with a 1-1 Tampa Bay team.\n\nThe Washington Redskins play the Giants in Week 4, so, barring injury, they will likely now face Jones.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
