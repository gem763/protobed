A political cartoonist compared her to Satan, and she was thrown in jail that same year for publishing an expos\u00e9 of a famous preacher\u2019s alleged affair.\n\nThough America has evolved to the point where voters have multiple female contenders to choose from in 2019, notes of the sexism and backlash that Woodhull faced because of her gender still linger in today\u2019s politics.\n\nWoodhull\u2019s candidacy was doomed from the start, and her embrace of what would now be considered feminist ideals ultimately led to her public downfall. But she was actually on a greater campaign: to expand what was possible for women of her time.\n\n\u201cVictoria did have a messianic aspect in all she did, which led her to believe she could make a major statement \u2014 that women should have the right to run for office, as well as get the vote \u2014 even if not in her lifetime,\u201d said Myra MacPherson, author of the Woodhull biography \u201cThe Scarlet Sisters: Sex, Suffrage, and Scandal in the Gilded Age.\"\n\nWoodhull was a contemporary of famed suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, but \u201cshe was a feminist, not a suffragist,\u201d MacPherson explained. The distinction was significant. While Anthony and Stanton primarily sought the right to vote, Woodhull espoused sexual, societal and economic liberation, concepts still controversial to many suffragists.\n\nShe advocated for \u201cfree love,\u201d a Victorian-era concept that espoused sexual and societal liberation for women and, most controversially, that women should be allowed to have sex outside marriage. Woodhull saw the institution as nothing more than a trap that robbed women of their identity, and denied them ownership not only of property, but their own bodies. At that time, when women married, they were completely subsumed by their husbands, with their rights to property and their children rendered moot. Long before \u201cdomestic violence\u201d entered the public lexicon, Woodhull was speaking before crowds about the evils of rape within marriage.\n\nBy the time Woodhull decided to run for president, she and her sister, Tennessee \u201cTennie\u201d Claflin, had already made a name for themselves in New York society for their views, which they espoused in their short-lived publication Woodhull & Claflin\u2019s Weekly. They lived large in Manhattan, establishing themselves as members of the new elite, despite the fact they actually hailed from the middle of Ohio, and had scrabbled their way to New York through ingenuity, grit and quite a bit of embellishment.\n\nIn 1870, with the backing of railroad and shipping tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, they opened the first female-run Wall Street Brokerage house, where \u201cthey played by men\u2019s rules\u201d and had a successful first year in business, MacPherson said.\n\nHaving stormed the Wall Street boys\u2019 club, Woodhull decided to make a bid for Pennsylvania Avenue. It had long been a dream of hers, MacPherson writes in her book, and Woodhull had gone so far as to fashion herself a signature of \u201cFuture Presidentess,\u201d a portmanteau of president and princess.\n\nShe announced her candidacy on April 2, 1870, in a New York Herald column, writing that \u201cI claim the right to speak for the unenfranchised women of the country \u2026 I now announce myself as a candidate for the presidency.\"\n\n\u201cI am quite well aware that in assuming this position I shall evoke more ridicule than enthusiasm at the outset,\u201d she continued, \u201cBut this is an epoch of sudden changes and startling surprises.\u201d She went on to compare women\u2019s suffrage to the 14th Amendment, which granted African Americans citizenship rights, saying that if this recently freed population could vote and hold office, so could women. (Woodhull\u2019s argument, however, was naively optimistic, as the battle to stop black disenfranchisement waged for another century, culminating in the Voting Rights Act. As many voting rights advocates would argue, that battle continues to this day.)\n\nIn a separate article, the Herald\u2019s writers praised her candidacy. At the time, suffragists pushed for a 15th Amendment to the Constitution that would guarantee women the right to vote, and the Herald boldly proclaimed that \u201cThe woman is inevitable, and she is \u2018coming\u2019 on the chariot wheels of woman\u2019s sweet willfulness and her irresistibly captivating appeal for a chance to experiment among the rulers. \u2026 Now then, for another amendment and victory for Victoria in 1872.\"\n\nOutlook: How racism almost killed womens' right to vote\n\nWoodhull sought to unite a coalition of African Americans, abolitionists, laborers, suffragists and 19th-century Spiritualists \u2014 groups that found themselves without a voice in government and relegated to the fringes of power.\n\nFirst, though, Woodhull needed a party, and there was no way Republicans or Democrats were going to choose her (they went with Ulysses S. Grant and Horace Greeley, a Liberal Republican, respectively.) Though she had support within the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), its co-founder, Susan B. Anthony, did not support her presidential ambitions, MacPherson writes.\n\nSo Woodhull hijacked the NWSA convention in May 1872, gliding onto the stage and declaring that \u201cthis convention adjourn to meet tomorrow morning at Apollo Hall!\u201d according to MacPherson.\n\nOn May 10, she convened a meeting of her newly formed Equal Rights Party at Apollo Hall in New York City. In \u201cThe Scarlet Sisters,\u201d MacPherson describes a progressive, diverse, chaotic and ultimately empowering scene:\n\nAs delegates assembled in Apollo Hall on the morning of May 10, they were tagged the most \u201cheterogeneous gathering that assembled in any city in any age.\u201d [\u2026] Banners draped throughout the hall reflected the party\u2019s support for radical working-class issues: government protection from the cradle to the grave; public employment a remedy for strikes. Blue silken banners on either side of the platform included one with gold writing: Jesus said: give to the poor [\u2026] Woodhull waited until the roar of applause died down, then gave an hour-long firebrand speech, denouncing politicians and the U.S. Constitution. \u201cSome may call this a revolution. Well, and if it does mean revolution what then? Shall we be slaves to escape revolution?\u201d Her voice rising, she shouted, \u201cI say, never! I say, away with such weak stupidity ... let us have justice, though the heavens fall!\u201d To tremendous applause and cheering, she called for a united movement to purge the country of \u201cpolitical trickery, despotic assumption and all industrial injustice.\u201d A new constitution was needed to replace an inadequate, \u201cblood-stained document.\u201d In the din, a delegate jumped up and swiftly nominated Woodhull for president; this was followed by a five-minute standing ovation. The uproar was so great that crowds rushed in from the street. Rumors that Woodhull had fainted were quelled when she reappeared onstage. Her bosom heaving and her voice trembling, she said, \u201cI thank you from the bottom of my soul for the honor you have conferred upon me tonight.\u201d The Scarlet Sisters, p. 165-166\n\nThe convention wasn\u2019t without its issues. It chose to nominate famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass as Woodhull\u2019s running mate, though Douglass never participated in the convention or acknowledged the nomination. Her supporters also lacked the money to donate to her cause.\n\nMacPherson writes that though some press outlets gave the convention page one coverage, others took jabs at the diverse attendees. \u201cSo far as dress and appearance went, [they] could be classed with either sex. There were all varieties of color and complexion,\u201d the New York World wrote, while the Philadelphia Inquirer referred to delegates as \u201csemi-\u00adlunatics.\u201d\n\nWomen of color were cut out of the suffragist story. Historians say it\u2019s time for a reckoning.\n\nWoodhull never got to actually campaign for the presidency or appear on any ballots, explained Kate Clarke Lemay of the National Portrait Gallery, who curated a current suffrage exhibition, \u201cVotes for Women: A Portrait of Persistence.\u201d Woodhull and her coalition were unquestionably ahead of their time, but within broader society, her beliefs were considered radical, even dangerous. The same ideas and outspokenness that made her famous ultimately led to her downfall.\n\nA February 1872 political cartoon in Harper\u2019s Weekly, titled \u201cMrs. Satan,\u201d depicts Woodhull as the devil holding a scroll that reads \u201cBe Saved by Free Love.\u201d Behind her, a ragged woman carrying two miserable looking children and an alcoholic husband on her back turns away from Woodhull, preparing to climb a steep, jagged path. The implication: that the burdened woman would rather suffer through life than associate with Woodhull.\n\n\u201cShe was a woman scorned, and it perfectly captured how scorned she was,\u201d Lemay said.\n\nAnd then, in November 1872, Woodhull and Claflin published a salacious accusation that a famous Protestant minister, the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, was having an affair. (For more context on Beecher\u2019s standing: His sister was abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin.\u201d) Beecher had preached against \u201cfree love,\u201d and Woodhull saw the affair as an example of a double standard for men.\n\nThe article ran afoul of the era\u2019s obscenity laws and spelled doom for her political career.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing just explodes, it becomes this national sensation,\u201d Lemay said. \u201cVictoria Woodhull gets arrested for spreading pornography, and put into jail for a couple months.\u201d\n\nImprisoned, Woodhull could not campaign, and never actually did as a presidential candidate. The first woman to actually campaign for president, Belva Lockwood, did so a few years later, in 1884, as a third-party candidate for the National Equal Rights Party. (Because of this distinction, some consider Lockwood, not Woodhull, the first woman to run for president.)\n\nThough she was doomed from the beginning, Lemay saw Woodhull\u2019s campaign as \u201ca great example of women in that era who saw they had no choices, and were doing anything they could to make room for themselves.\u201d\n\nWoodhull did not become president. No woman has. But that doesn\u2019t mean she failed.\n\n\u201cThe presidency is an incidental thing that gave her a historic base in some people\u2019s minds,\u201d MacPherson told The Washington Post. \u201cBut basically what was amazing was [Woodhull and Claflin\u2019s] ability to really fight on male terms, on Wall Street and the rest of their lives, on issues we still don\u2019t have, like equal pay for equal work, and coeducational classes teaching sex education.\n\n\u201cI think her real role was to present issues that didn\u2019t pass at the time but became very well recognized as women\u2019s issues,\u201d MacPherson said. \u201cShe really pushed it with the concept of trying to prove that women could do anything.\"\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018Night of terror\u2019: The suffragists who were beaten and tortured for seeking the vote\n\nFor International Women\u2019s Day, here are 7 of history\u2019s greatest women-led protests\n\nWhy did women in Congress wear white for Trump\u2019s State of the Union address?", "description": "Before Warren, Harris or Clinton, there was Victoria Woodhull, the woman often credited as the first female presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SVFULVOBMRBWFC5SLADTWUOMUE.PNG", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
