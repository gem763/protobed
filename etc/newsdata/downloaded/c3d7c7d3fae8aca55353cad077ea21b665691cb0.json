In hopes of cheering up his spouse, who was upset to miss the session, the prankster posed in and around a local waterfall, pretending to have a bun in the oven himself. Must-see images from the silly stunt have since gone viral on Facebook.\n\nKelsey Brewer was on bedrest for nearly two weeks before the birth of her son on Sept. 28, USA Today reports, and felt bad that she would have to miss her scheduled maternity photo shoot with her sister, Kiana Smither, who runs K.M. Smither Photography.\n\nWOMAN'S SIMPLE FRIDGE HACK GOES VIRAL\n\nKelsey\u2019s husband Jared, meanwhile, secretly coordinated with Kiana to pose for maternity-inspired pictures of his own, to give his wife a laugh.\n\n\"I had seen something similar before on Facebook and had early on in the pregnancy joked about taking photos like that,\" he told USA Today. \"But once she was put on bed rest, reaching out to her sister to take the photos for her seemed like the best idea to put a smile on her face.\"\n\nUnder Kiana\u2019s expert direction, Jared struck a pose at the Elkhorn Creek in Frankfort, smiling, holding and dramatically working it for the camera, holding his stomach. Dressed for the occasion in a snapback hat, button-down shirt and jeans, the good-natured jokester even splashed around and got soaking wet during the photo session.\n\n\u201cJared is a big goofball,\u201d the photographer told HuffPost. \u201cHe was working it in front of the camera! I would ask him to do a pose and he would add this extra flair to it.

That I will literally cherish for the rest of my life!!\u201d Kelsey wrote online. \u201cThank you so much Kiana\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to watch you work your magic once our sweet boy is here!\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nOn Sept. 28, the couple\u2019s son Kash Cooper arrived in the world, HuffPost reports, and his aunt Kiana has since described the infant as a \u201csuper cutie.\u201d", "description": "Lights, camera\u2026 that\u2019s not a baby bump!", "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
