One of the important documents of that moment in the spring was a piece in Politico Magazine by Bill Scher titled \u201dDid The Left Misread the 2020 Democratic Primary?\u201d To a not inconsiderable number of pundits, an obvious answer was taking shape, just a few weeks into Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cHe has dominated the polls since he entered the race last month,\u201d Scher wrote. \u201cBefore Biden announced, he was at a measly 29 percent in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, only 6 percentage points ahead of progressive favorite Bernie Sanders, who not all that long ago looked like a genuine co-front-runner. Since then, Biden has surged to 40 percent, kicking Sanders down to the mid-teens.\u201d\n\nScher went on to explain that the threat of Trump\u2019s reelection had made most of the primary electorate \u201cmore cautious and less radical,\u201d a mindset favorable to Biden and at odds with assertions that a large share of Democrats were hungry for ambitious policy change. \u201cIt\u2019s indisputable that such a faction exists among Democratic primary voters,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut if the left is wrong about its breadth, it will take more than a good clapback tweet for them to figure out what to do next.\u201d In New York Magazine, Jonathan Chait agreed. \u201cPerhaps it was the party\u2019s intelligentsia, not Biden, that was out of touch with the modern Democratic electorate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe conclusion that Biden could not lead the post-Obama Democratic Party is the product of misplaced assumptions about the speed of its transformation. Yes, the party has moved left, but not nearly as far or as fast as everybody seemed to believe.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis was a premature assertion for a variety of reasons, the simplest of which being math. The initial spike in Biden\u2019s support following his announcement leveled off by mid-June, at which point polls clearly showed that the combined constituency for the race\u2019s progressive standard bearers, Sanders and Warren, was as large or larger than Biden\u2019s\u2014without even counting the supporters of formerly moderate candidates who had taken from the 2016 election no small amount of encouragement to move leftward, such as Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.\n\nWe have seen since that Warren\u2019s progressivism has neither prevented her from broadening her base of support within the primary electorate, nor from taking the lead from Biden in a growing number of polls. Sanders, in third place, remains very much in the hunt having raised more money than any other candidate. Biden, by contrast, is lagging in fundraising and, it was reported Tuesday night, has only about $8 million in cash on hand. Even his advantage in perceived electability among Democratic voters seems to be waning, thanks perhaps in part to Hunter Biden and the Ukraine situation. The rest of the field\u2019s moderates have failed to build any meaningfully large constituency and some have been forced to move substantially left on issues including healthcare and climate change to keep themselves relevant within the Democratic policy discourse and within public view.\n\n", "description": "The Democratic field's middle-of-the-roadsters spent debate night working through their status anxiety.", "authors": ["Osita Nwanevu"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/c45d15e8f49ce93b3a4daa9e52a7f1379e2569c0.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
