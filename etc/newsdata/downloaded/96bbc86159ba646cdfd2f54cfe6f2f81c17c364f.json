And, if you're one of these folks, you know that all moisturizers are not created equal. Luckily, looking out for some key ingredients can save you a lot of trial and error when it comes to soothing your chapped face.\n\nFace creams that contain ceramides, for example, are usually a good bet; these molecules mimic your skin's natural lipid layer, which is a central component of its protective barrier. Hyaluronic acid is another ingredient to keep an eye out for. It works to attract and trap moisture, and in fact, can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water \u2014 making it something of an overachiever in the skin care industry.\n\nWhile finding the right face cream is key to mitigating dry skin, the steps you take before you apply that face cream are equally important. You'll want to gently exfoliate pre-moisturizer, since dry patches of skin can block pores and keep face creams from penetrating deeply. Misting your face with a hydrating toner is also a smart move; damp skin absorbs creams more thoroughly.\n\nOf course, if dry skin is a recurring issue you should talk to your dermatologist before embarking on a new routine. They can determine whether or not your skin is dehydrated because of an underlying condition like eczema or psoriasis. If that's the case, you may need a prescription for proper treatment.\n\nHere are the best face creams for dry skin in 2019:\n\nUpdated on 9/16/19 by Caitlin Petreycik: Updated copy, formatting, links, and prices.", "description": "We tested popular face creams specially formulated for dry skin to find the best, most hydrating options out there.", "authors": ["Maria Del Russo"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d1a6ae1a17d6c0b457ed552-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
