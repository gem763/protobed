Sean Duffy took a few moments at the end of his remarks to address the chairwoman, Maxine Waters. He very graciously thanked her for what he described as showing him respect, though usually off-camera.\n\nHow did Rep. Waters respond to Duffy? She responded mostly by swatting him with the back of her hand. Apparently it is impossible for the hyper-partisan Democrat to see Republican colleagues as decent human beings even when one delivers thanks to her for the time he worked with her on the committee. Sean Duffy is resigning from office due to personal family matters. He was first elected to represent Wisconsin\u2019s 7th District in 2011.\n\nDuffy and his wife Rachel Campos-Duffy are the parents of eight children, with a ninth baby on the way. Pre-natal testing shows that the baby will be born with a heart condition. Duffy made the decision to return home to be with his family rather than continue commuting to Washington, D.C. for work.\n\nAs you see, Waters delivers a weird kind of passive-aggressive riff to Duffy. She starts off by saying she is \u201cshocked\u201d by his kind remarks about her. My first reaction is that this is why Republicans shouldn\u2019t go out of their way to be gracious to Democrats, at least in the current atmosphere. The old days when at least basic civility and compassion was shown to other members of Congress in times of personal crisis \u2013 even to those on the opposite side of the aisle \u2013 are long gone. While Waters began in a quasi-decent way, she quickly tamped down any niceties with snark. Maybe it was playing to the camera and wanting to signal to other Democrats that she isn\u2019t going soft but it came off very unflattering and just icky. A good example is this: \u201cI want to thank you for the times you have tried to interfere with me doing my work over here when you rush across the aisle with another comment that is unwelcome.\u201d Oh, when Duffy was simply doing his job?\n\nWaters did finally settle down a bit and wish him and his family well in good humor. Was that so hard? Apparently so. Rep. Ann Wagner tearfully bid Duffy goodbye. She is a fierce advocate for the unborn and frequently gets choked up about the vulnerable.\n\nDuffy and his wife announced their family\u2019s decision for him to return home in August.\n\n\u201cWith much prayer, I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby and family need right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not an easy decision \u2014 because I truly love being your Congressman \u2014 but it is the right decision for my family, which is my first love and responsibility.\u201d\n\nWe can all wish the Duffy family well.", "description": "Is there no decency left?", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Maxine-Waters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
