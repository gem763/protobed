I couldn't be more proud of my body for giving me my son,' Tiffiny said.\n\nTiffiny said she took the pressure off feeling as if she had to return to her pre-pregnancy size by being 'proud of my body for giving me my son'\n\n'It was day one back at work (I'd been working from home, but this was my first commitment that required leaving the house - any new mum knows this is a big deal!) and Arnold was with me in the studio.'\n\nWhat makes the snap memorable was it marked the first day Tiffiny was able to return to exercise, something she could only manage for a few moments at a time.\n\n'I could only manage five minutes, with low-impact modifications, but my smile says it all! I got it in,' she said.\n\nDespite the fact Tiffiny could only manage five minutes of exercise at a time when she first started excising after giving birth, she soon built this up to 20 minutes a day\n\nAt the start of her journey, Tiffiny previously recalled she was too weak to even complete one push up on her knees.\n\n'\u2063Picture two is nine months after having Arnold. I am shooting new workout videos for my TIFFXO community,' she said on the Instagram post.\n\n'I built on that five-minute workout and I'm feeling fit and strong again.'\n\n'I'm still breastfeeding, I've dropped a couple of sizes and I'm feeling awesome. It took me months!\u2063'\n\nThe inspirational fitness guru said she 'never wanted to bounce back, I wanted to bounce forward'\n\nAs well as making fitness a priority, the health expert said she choosing to reframe her ideas about 'bouncing back' made losing weight and exercising a more positive experience.\n\n'I never wanted to bounce back, I wanted to bounce forward,' she said.\n\n'A new mindset of appreciation has helped me take the pressure off how I look and put focus on the power of my body\u2026 and nailing that jab.'\n\nA simple mindshift helped Tiffiny commit to healthy eating and regular workouts following the birth of her son Arnold (pictured with Tiffiny)\n\nSince sharing the photos to Instagram, nearly 10,000 people have liked the post and hundreds more have left comments thanking her for her inspiring words.\n\n'Thank you for your honesty,' one person wrote.\n\n'After my first born I struggled accepting my body changed and then I saw how you where embracing it and it made me change my outlook.\n\n'Without you I don't think I would have got my body back or feel great about just being me.'\n\nWhile another added: You are dead set legend! You have inspired me so much... from learning meditation, listening to my body and of course nailing that power jab!'", "description": "Australian fitness trainer  Tiffiny Hall has revealed how she transformed her body after giving birth to her son.", "authors": ["Emilia Mazza For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/23/19346004-0-image-a-2_1570315807175.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
