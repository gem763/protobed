It seemed almost like the Bulgarian fans were determined to live up to the worst representation of themselves.'\n\nThe first step of UEFA's anti-racism protocol was enacted as an announcement was made over the stadium's public address system calling for the abusive chanting to stop.\n\nSouthgate and his players spoke to the referee about the offensive chants they heard\n\nSelf-described 'hooligans from Sofia' dressed in black and had their faces covered\n\nGary Lineker praised Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov for pleading with the fans at half-time to stop the abuse\n\nIt continued, and there was a further delay close to half-time. It is understood that this did not constitute the second step of the protocol, where the referee takes the players off the pitch temporarily.\n\nThe third and final step of the protocol is to abandon the fixture.\n\n'There has to be a wider debate about, where we have a match like this, what should happen,' Powar added.\n\nSterling, who scored twice, posted an Ainsley Harriott meme as he agreed with Piers Morgan that there is 'no sweeter way' to show up the Bulgarians than having a black England player 'destroy their team with his sublime talent'\n\nSterling also took aim at the Bulgaria coach who said England had a bigger racism problem than his own country\n\nEngland forward Harry Kane speaks with the referees during a temporary interruption in the first half of the qualifier\n\nSouthgate consoled England striker and goalscorer Marcus Rashford as he left the field after being substituted having previously been targeted with abuse\n\nRashford, who scored England's opening goal with a fine finish, said he was 'proud we rose above it' and said it was not an incident that should happen in 2019\n\nA fan holds up a No Respect jumper, rubbishing UEFA's Respect campaign for equality and an end to racism in football\n\nBulgarian fans with hoods and face masks, some of them with 'hooligans' printed on their shirts, head for the exits after the second stoppage\n\nEngland fans responded to the racism with loud cheers for their players and a rousing rendition of the national anthem\n\nEngland captain Kane spoke to referee Ivan Bobek as game was stopped the first time\n\nBulgaria have previously been sanctioned by UEFA and they were ordered to leave 5,000 seats empty tonight as a punishment for previous abuse against Kosovo\n\nEngland and Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard tweeted an image of a black and white Three Lions crest, calling it a 'shameful' night in Sofia\n\nBulgaria coach denies abuse Bulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov insists he did not hear any racist chanting from his nation's supporters and slammed England fans for interrupting the Bulgaria national anthem. This is despite monkey noises aimed at England forward Raheem Sterling being clearly heard at the ground and on television. Balakov told ITV: 'I personally did not hear the chanting you are most probably referring to. I saw that the referee stopped the game. 'But I also have to say the unacceptable behaviour was not only on behalf of the Bulgaria fans but also the England fans who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgaria national anthem and during the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable.'\n\n'These are real genuine dilemmas which are difficult to resolve - should UEFA have intervened and told the Bulgarians where to host this match? There are not many football associations around the world who would take that sort of interference.\n\n'Should the England players and the English FA have refused to have played it given the fact all the predictions and all their concerns came true?\n\n'Should Bulgaria now be eliminated from the competition, regardless of what the next step in the sanctioning process is?\n\n'A lot of difficult questions UEFA will need to answer now, these are not easy issues to grapple with.'\n\nUEFA rules appear to indicate that the punishment for Bulgaria would be to play their next home match behind closed doors, but there is likely to be huge pressure for the sanctions to be more severe than that.\n\nAnti-racism campaign group Kick It Out called for a points deduction to be imposed or for Bulgaria to be expelled from the competition.\n\nTyrone Mings (centre) making his debut for England, was the first player to report the abuse which led to the first stoppage\n\nMings thanked the England fans for their support at the end of the match after being on the end of the horrific abuse\n\nMings said he was 'very proud' to make his debut despite the 'unfortunate incidents'", "description": "Anti-discrimination group FARE (Football Against Racism in Europe) will help UEFA build a 'legally safe' case to prosecute Bulgaria after the abusive chanting during their match against England.", "authors": ["Jamie Gardner"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/06/19725000-0-image-a-21_1571117627911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
