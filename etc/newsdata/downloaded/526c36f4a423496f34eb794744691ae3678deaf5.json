Today: Steven Marks, founder of Aussie Mexican restaurant chain Guzman y Gomez.\n\nCurrent gig: Founder and Global CEO of Guzman y Gomez.\n\nCurrent location: Surry Hills in Sydney, but next week we\u2019re moving...around the corner to Surry Hills!\n\nCurrent mobile device: Apple iPhone, of course!\n\nCurrent computer: Apple \u2014 it\u2019s all about Apple for me, they\u2019re one of my most favourite brands in the world.\n\nOne word that best describes how you work: Intensity\n\nWhat apps/software/tools can't you live without?\n\nThe Guzman y Gomez app is my No. 1, then Instagram, WhatsApp, Google, Netflix and a couple of secret ones my marketing team won\u2019t let me tell you about! They\u2019re our secret sauce!\n\nWhat social network do you find the most useful?\n\nInstagram, it keeps me in tune with my brand all over the world but also how my guests are feeling. That said, I\u2019m also finding LinkedIn a great way to connect with people these days.\n\nWhat were the most important lessons you learned while growing your business?\n\nYou have to go through major pain to succeed and you have to learn from failure. But never stop growing.\n\nWhat has been the most surprising part of your business journey?\n\nFor my most powerful results, I\u2019ve learned to balance intensity with calmness.\n\nWhat everyday thing are you better at than anyone else?\n\nMy team tell me I have great vision for GYG, for me it\u2019s just a gut instinct that feels right. I never doubt my decisions and I never look backwards. We can do the craziest things or have record days selling burritos but I\u2019m always looking at that next record and what\u2019s next. I feel like I can drive our business forward and I\u2019m always thinking a few years ahead so I know where we are going and how to get us there.\n\nWhat's your sleep routine like?\n\nI have my kids every second week so I do all my business meetings and socialising one week and then have a more relaxed week the next but I\u2019m generally in bed by 11pm most nights. I focus on keeping my mind and body healthy at all times so I\u2019m usually early to bed and early to rise. I start talking to my team around 5am each morning, fortunately the team are usually awake at the same time as me so it works!\n\nWhat advice would you offer to other businesses on how to succeed?\n\nYou have to believe in what you are doing. Not a blind belief, you always need to listen to what others are telling you but business is hard and Australia is really difficult. Rents are high, labour is high, food costs are high so if you can make it here in Australia, you can make it anywhere! Make sure you have people around you who will support you all the way. For me that was bringing in a co-founder, my best friend Robert Hazan. He keeps me centred and he\u2019s better at a lot of things in business that aren\u2019t my strengths.", "description": "How I Succeeded is a regular series on Lifehacker where we ask business leaders for the secrets and tactics behind their success.
