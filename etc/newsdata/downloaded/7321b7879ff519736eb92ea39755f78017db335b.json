Photo: Eric Liebowitz/Netflix\n\nTimothy Greenberg is the man responsible for cloning Paul Rudd. Well, more accurately, he\u2019s the man responsible for cloning Paul Rudd\u2019s character Miles in the Netflix series Living With Yourself, a show he created. Greenberg, who spent several years working on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart, recently explained to Vulture how the idea for the show \u2014 which focuses on a dissatisfied man who goes for an elite spa treatment and winds up with a superior duplicate of himself \u2014 occurred to him, and all the places the story could go from here. He also talked about the role Charlie Kaufman played in the show \u2014 both his work and the man himself \u2014 why the scene in which Paul Rudd emerged from his own grave \u201cscared the shit out of him,\u201d and what he learned from Rudd about how to project the best version of yourself.\n\nNote: There is a spoiler in this interview about the ending of Living With Yourself. Another warning will appear before that section of the interview for those who haven\u2019t watched in full.\n\nWhat inspired this particular idea for a TV show?\n\nHonestly, it was a lot of things. I\u2019d had variations of this idea over the years in a lot of different forms. Like anyone, I struggle with life. Sometimes I\u2019m the best version of myself. You know, the one that feels good about myself and presents well to the world, and because I feel good about myself, I think I am better to others and I am less selfish. And other times, when I\u2019m not feeling as good about myself or about the world, I think I am less kind and more selfish and certainly interact with others not as well, my loved ones perhaps most of all. It\u2019s been sort of a lifelong struggle with, why can\u2019t we get to be our best selves all of the time? The sort of, \u201cOoh, I\u2019d like to try that ride\u201d is, what would it be like if you met yourself? And then the thought is, well what would it be like if you met your imagined, perfect, and prized version of yourself? What if you met the worst version of yourself? What would that be like, you know?\n\nI think it\u2019s Robert Burns, right, that famous [line]: \u201cWould it be that we could see ourselves as others do?\u201d [Note: The exact line is, \u201cOh would some Power the gift give us, to see ourselves as others see us.\u201d] I think that\u2019s fascinating. I think if we could do that, if we could see ourselves, I think that would go a long way toward making us better people, making us a better society.\n\nLook, it came from a million things. It came from arguments my wife and I used to have. It came from, like I was really into science fiction my entire life, and this idea\u2019s been kicking around there for a long time. It came from the panic I had when I used to be at The Daily Show, and Jon Stewart told us he was leaving, and I felt like, \u201cOh my god! I need a job!\u201d It came from a lot.\n\nYou mentioned sci-fi and I was curious about whether certain films or projects inspired the show. When I watched it, I got some major Charlie Kaufman vibes from it.\n\nMy greatest hope is that one day somebody will call me, like, a cheap rip-off of Charlie Kaufman. [Laughs.]\n\nI mean, very specifically, he had somewhat of a role in this coming about. I was meeting with Anthony Bregman, who had produced Eternal Sunshine, just to ask his advice on movie stuff. But I\u2019d already had this idea a week earlier of doing a TV show. When I was walking out of his office, I noticed the Eternal Sunshine poster, and clearly there\u2019s some shared sensibility between the two. So I said, you know, \u201cYou have a TV division \u2026\u201d and he had just in fact hired somebody [to oversee that division]. So I came back a week later and I pitched him the idea and he loved it and we kind of went from there and developed it.\n\nBut I mean, there\u2019s no point in trying to rip off Charlie because he\u2019s too brilliant. Ironically, Adaptation, which is the one that has the two of them, that one doesn\u2019t feel quite as similar to me as some of the other ones. Although we did look at Adaptation very specifically for some of the stuff that Spike Jonze did in terms of how they had the two [Nicolas Cages] in the shot at once, and how the camera would move and that kind of thing. And Charlie actually was kind enough to read a couple of early drafts and talk about it, which gave me some ideas.\n\nWhen I talked to him, which was definitely one of the highlights of this entire project, what we got in discussion about was not as much the script and the story, it was about our worldview. And his worldview, his view of humanity, is definitely a bit darker than mine. Which is obvious if you see his movies, but it was only when I talked to him I was like, oh wow, he\u2019s definitely darker than I am! [Laughs.] That was a cool thing for me to experience, us talking about that on that level.\n\nThe opening of the series really grabs your attention, with Miles emerging from the ground wrapped in cellophane. How did you come up with that idea, that the clones would be buried? And not that deeply, by the way. They seem to be in a remote location, but they\u2019re not that far underground.\n\nI mean, it was plenty fuckin\u2019 deep. [Laughs.]\n\nOh, really?\n\nIt was deep. It was more panicked than I\u2019ve ever been while shooting anything, and I\u2019ve shot at The Daily Show over the years, some really ridiculous, dangerous stuff. But this scared the shit out of me. Like, it was really disturbing. That\u2019s behind the scenes. As they describe in the show, normally they dissolve the bodies into acid, but they\u2019d had problems, you know, sourcing things from Korea, so for now they\u2019re just kind of burying them in this big forest. So, this is not like all of their clients.\n\nWell, now I\u2019m wondering if Paul Rudd was freaked out by shooting that.\n\nHe did it four times, which is amazing. I thought we\u2019d get one, but he did it four times. He was such a trooper. But yeah, I mean, it just feels wrong. It was just horribly creepy, I think for him and for us, and terrifying. [Laughs.] Like, I won\u2019t do that again, or if I do, we\u2019ll do the stunts a different way.\n\nAt what point in the process did you think of Paul Rudd for this?\n\nI mean, instantly, and then not for four more years. Pretty much right out of the gate I was like, \u201cWho\u2019d be great for this?\u201d And he was the top of the list. Then it was a long process of us taking it around town to sell. We eventually sold it to IFC and fully developed it there, and I wrote the entire season for them. When we were there, we couldn\u2019t afford him. We didn\u2019t even bother calling him, because IFC\u2019s budget just limited us. It eventually died there due to circumstances beyond, I think, even IFC\u2019s control.\n\nThen we took it back out and got Netflix, and then we were able to take out the original list, because Netflix has money. Actually, they were the ones who said, \u201cHere\u2019s our list of people that we love, but Paul is definitely at the top.\u201d He had been at the top of our dream list way back when, and he was the first and only person we showed it to at that point. It couldn\u2019t have worked out better.\n\nYou were talking before about Adaptation and looking at that as far as how to shoot the same actor in a dual role. Obviously that\u2019s been done before, but can you talk a little bit about the challenges of doing that and how you navigated it?\n\nIn its basic concept, the techniques we used were as old as filmmaking, usually. We did have this one machine that could move the camera around through an x, y, z axis on a giant crane, and it would remember that and repeat it. That\u2019s one technique to use, to move the camera around and still have people moving in the frame. A lot of them were some of the more typical kinds of tricks you would use, split screens and some other things, and we did do some minimal face replacement. I don\u2019t wanna say our VFX crew did nothing, because they did a lot, but it was a lot more like you would imagine doing it at home than you might think.\n\nWhat\u2019s much more interesting to me is how Paul would do it from a performance perspective. We would decide who was driving the scene, and he would record the dialogue for the opposite character \u2014 in other words, the least important dialogue, he would record the audio of. He\u2019d kind of imagine the scene ahead of time, and he\u2019d try to do it in the timing, and the intonations and everything, as he was actually going to do it. He\u2019d take that recording, and put it in his [earpiece] and he\u2019d listen to that as he would perform the first side of the scene for the camera. Then, we\u2019d go back and do the second side of the scene again, now listening to his original film performance and playing against that. Not only did he have to get timing down, obviously, but he had to get the arc of the scene and the emotions and all of that mentally in place before he could even begin.\n\nHe\u2019s clearly done a lot of acting in general, and acting to, you know, a pair of tennis balls or things like that just seems second nature to him. But I thought it was really interesting, the way that he built the scene like that. And also, he could switch back and forth. What we did with Miles is just take off the makeup, mess up his hair, and get him in there. We\u2019d turn around fast, so he\u2019d really be switching characters very quickly. That was both great and fascinating to see, and saved our production schedule a lot.\n\nThat\u2019s really the main differentiator between the two versions of Miles: his hair, and he carries himself less confidently.\n\nHere\u2019s something that I still am amazed by. I think it\u2019s one of the two diner scenes, if you look at his face in each image, it looks like the shape of his face is different. I was there. We didn\u2019t do anything to him! But somehow, in his posture, and in his behavior, to me they really feel like markedly different [people]. Early on, long before he got on set or maybe before we even cast him, we were always worried about, well, are we going to have to resort to tricks to tell them apart? But you know which character it is. Even once this is New Miles trying to be Old Miles, he still feels like New Miles acting like Old Miles. He could manage that kind of 3-D chess of all those performances.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that you say that about his face in the diner scene, because there were a couple times where I did think, \u201cDid they film some of this at different times?\u201d\n\n\ufeffYeah, it was totally wild. I couldn\u2019t figure out how he was doing it. In one he looks almost like a movie star, and then in another he looks like a regular person. But he really did \u2014 I mean again, nothing against the makeup people, they were great \u2014 but like, we didn\u2019t do that much. It was really his performance.\n\nKind of makes you wonder how much better you could make yourself look if you could do whatever the heck Paul Rudd was doing!\n\nI swear to God, it\u2019s true. He would share some of what he was doing with us, but you know, he didn\u2019t want to have extensive conversations about it. But we did talk about posture a bit, and ever since then, it\u2019s made me much more conscious of my posture, because I\u2019m a big sloucher. Literally, right now, I\u2019m sitting on one of those balance chairs that\u2019s supposed to get your posture corrected. I just set it up today, because I\u2019m more aware of how your posture affects the way you look. Stand straight, I\u2019ve learned from Paul Rudd, and you\u2019ll be a better version of yourself.\n\n[Note: Here come some spoilers about the conclusion of Living With Yourself.]\n\nI wanted to ask you about the ending of the season. The idea that Kate would be pregnant: Did you have other possible endings, or was that always going to be what happened?\n\nThat was an idea from pretty early on, just because you know, now they\u2019re really tied together. [Laughs] Once you have family together, you guys are together. You better be able to live with your best and worst self because it\u2019s for real once the kid comes onto the scene.\n\nAlso the fun of it is the fact that they don\u2019t really know who the father is, because maybe it doesn\u2019t matter. Certainly, arguably, it doesn\u2019t matter. But to a different degree it does matter that they can\u2019t know and they can\u2019t ever know. Whenever that idea did come up, I immediately liked it. Never varied.\n\nWe did have to scooch around the potential timing of it. Like, just when could she have gotten pregnant and how long and when was the earliest? I had so many conversations with obstetrician-gynecologists: Could she have gotten pregnant, and when could she have tested positive? Okay, no, we need more time. How do we build in more time? That was something we were doing right up in the edit even.\n\nThat teases the things that could be explored in future seasons. Have you thought about what a second season might look like?\n\nI\u2019ve thought about it a lot. I don\u2019t want to get too tied to anything, emotionally or otherwise until all of the parties feel that we want a second season, you know?\n\nMyself, Paul, Netflix, at such time that we all feel like, yeah, maybe we want to continue the story or do a different take on the story, then I would really commit to thinking about it. But I\u2019ve got all kinds of great ideas. There\u2019s a lot of backstory that\u2019s only hinted at in this season that would be revealed in the future.\n\nOne of the reasons we ended it the way we did is it could go either way. I think it\u2019s very satisfying on its own, I think if it also raises a desire to see more \u2014 either way, I\u2019m happy.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "description": "Timothy Greenberg, creator of the Netflix series Living With Yourself, discusses the idea behind the series, the role Charlie Kaufman played in its creation, and what Paul Rudd\u2019s performance taught him about acting (and posture).", "authors": ["Jen Chaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-living-with-yourself.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
