However, what users don\u2019t see is the malicious macro code that will execute once they click on the button.\u201d\n\nIf clicked, the booby-trapped document begins communicating with a server containing Emotet and tries to install malware on the recipient\u2019s computer, in turn putting their data at risk of being digitally hijacked by hackers.\n\n\u201cEmotet is a double or even triple threat if it is not quarantined right away,\u201d Malwarebytes warned.\n\nReleased on Sept. 17, \u201cPermanent Record\u201d is the first book written by Mr. Snowden, 36, since he leaked a trove of classified U.S. government material to the media in 2013. The Department of Justice filed a civil suit against Mr. Snowden the same day it hit shelves, arguing the former National Security Agency contractor violated non-disclosure agreements by failing to have the book reviewed by the government before publication.\n\nEmails containing the malicious Word documents were sent in several languages and make reference to the controversy surrounding Mr. Snowden\u2019s book, Malwarebytes noted.\n\n\u201cFirst, they spy on us, then they persecute whistleblowers, now they ban books. Freedom? Time to organise collective readings of Snowden book everywhere. Go, buy the book now, read it, share it, discuss it,\u201d reads one of the spam emails sent in English.\n\nSimilar emails containing the malicious attachment were discovered in Italian, Spanish, German and French, according to the blog post.\n\n\u201cCriminals are known to capitalize on newsworthy events for scams and other social engineering purposes,\u201d the post acknowledged.\n\nOriginally designed to steal financial data, Emotet has wreaked havoc on computer systems belonging to victims in the U.S. and abroad since first being discovered in 2014, in one instance resulting in the city of Allentown, Pennsylvania, planning to spend $1 million to rebound from an infection.\n\n\u201cEmotet continues to be among the most costly and destructive malware affecting state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) governments, and the private and public sectors,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security warned last year.\n\nMr. Snowden was previously charged by the Justice Department with criminal violations related to leaking NSA documents. He was abroad when the charges were filed and has not returned to stand trial.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
