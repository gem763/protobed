We\u2019re able to talk about bigger things. Now that I\u2019ve opened up, the people around me have started to open up, too.\n\nCan having sex cause thrush?\n\nAnd it\u2019s made me think about how much time I\u2019ve spent being not-the-best friend when I wasn\u2019t open about what I was dealing with (meaning depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and obsessive thoughts).\n\nI want to say sorry.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for all the times I didn\u2019t message you back because I overthought a response, then decided that ignoring you entirely would make you hate me less than taking a few hours to send a text.\n\n(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nI\u2019m sorry I declined your calls, scared to reveal that yes, you had woken me up, because I\u2019m still in bed at 3pm on a Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sorry I backed out of plans at the last minute because after getting ready much too early, my anxiety jumped in to remind me of all the dangers outside my house.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for lying, for covering things up, for pretending I had food poisoning or other commitments.\n\nSome other stuff I don\u2019t feel proud of:\n\nAll the times I pushed you away because I didn\u2019t want you to notice that I wasn\u2019t being myself. The times I got angry for no reason, was irritable, and decided the easiest option was to cut you out of my life instead of letting you in.\n\n(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe moments I wasn\u2019t 100% invested in our conversations, when my attention wandered as you told me what\u2019s been going on \u2013 because I was too busy thinking about what a rubbish person I was and obsessing over mess-ups.\n\nThe times I let myself drift because I didn\u2019t feel like I could keep up with the rest of you, going out, going for runs in the morning, working on stuff together.\n\nI felt embarrassed.\n\nAshamed that the simplest things suddenly felt impossible, that my brain wasn\u2019t a safe place for me to be anymore, that I was scared of turned on light switches, open doors, footsteps behind me.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for doubting that you\u2019d understand. I\u2019m sorry that my brain told me I couldn\u2019t trust you or rely on you, that telling you would what was happening would be a mistake.\n\n(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about depression \u2013 it becomes your biggest secret and your closest friend, and pushes everyone else away in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepression hides the person people know and love. It makes you irritable, withdrawn, suddenly uninterested in all the things you used to get excited about.\n\nIt tells you that you don\u2019t deserve friends and loved ones, and makes you believe that if you were to tell anyone your thoughts, they\u2019d recoil in horror.\n\nThat\u2019s why actually opening up and being honest \u2013 which is a big part of being a good friend, if you didn\u2019t know \u2013 feels so f***ing scary.\n\n(Picture: Erin Aniker for Metro.co.uk)\n\nYou\u2019re scared that they\u2019ll reject you. That they\u2019ll say something pushes you over the edge.\n\nTrusting someone with your biggest, heaviest secret gives them power: to hurt you or help you get better.\n\nTo avoid that, I pushed people away.\n\nI became a good actress. I said I was fine, that something had come up when you asked to spend time together, I made sure to stick to \u2018safe\u2019 topics when we talked so I wouldn\u2019t let things slip.\n\nI wasn\u2019t a good friend because I wasn\u2019t being myself. I wasn\u2019t letting people in.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry about that, because it wrecked a lot of friendships, made me miss out on years of great talks with my mum, who I kept at a distance so she wouldn\u2019t figure out what was going on in my head, and held me back from making connections with new people.\n\nI\u2019m working on that now.\n\n(Picture: Erin Aniker for Metro.co.uk)\n\nI\u2019m learning that the people I care about care about me, too. They won\u2019t hate me just because I\u2019m sad, or judge me for being scared \u2013 they just care that I\u2019m okay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m working on trusting people. I\u2019m working on listening to the people I love instead of the negative voice in my head that tells me everyone hates me and I\u2019m generally sh*t.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to need a little help from the people in my life to get through a time that\u2019s not all that great.\n\nThe people I want in my life aren\u2019t the ones who\u2019d ditch me when things get tough. They\u2019re the ones that are there to listen when I need it, who know, now, that they can open up to me too, and they\u2019re the ones that help me to stay sane every day \u2013 more than they know.\n\nSo now I\u2019m done with the sorries \u2013 although I\u2019m sure there are more to come with further unanswered texts and ditched plans \u2013 I want to say thank you.\n\nThank you to the people who\u2019ve stuck with me when I haven\u2019t been the best friend in return. Thank you for listening. Thank you for caring.\n\nWhen your brain turns on you, you need good friends more than ever. And I\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve got you.\n\nI\u2019m getting better. And I\u2019ll get better at being your friend along the way.\n\nHow to listen to our new mental health podcast: If you like reading about mental health stuff, you\u2019ll probably also like listening to it.
