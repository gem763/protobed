As Evert recollected feeling stronger after giving birth than before being pregnant, her listener\u2019s face must have lapsed into know-nothing surprise.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said with her long-established wit. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have a baby. Take my word for it.\u201d\n\nLife is a mystery from moment one, including for mothers who exert to create moment one, and if Serena Williams wins her 24th Grand Slam title Saturday as the mother of a 2-year-old, she will notch more than a tie with Margaret Court atop the all-time chart. She will join a concise list of Grand Slam singles title-winning mothers alongside only Margaret Court (three, in 1973), Evonne Goolagong (Wimbledon, in 1980) and Kim Clijsters (three, from 2009-11). The particular feat does seem worthy of a singular level of impression, yet from hearing Williams and Evert and Shriver and others, it also appears that, like so many other areas in life, the hurdles vary in size and by person.\n\n[Oh, Momma, it\u2019s a rout: Serena Williams rolls into U.S. Open final]\n\nClijsters, for one, won the 2009 U.S. Open and described the physical rigors, referring to \u201cthe core, the lower back area, that was always something that was very strong, but after pregnancy, that just \u2014 yeah, it just goes.\u201d\n\nShe told of withstanding waves of \u201cthe most boring exercises ever,\u201d beginning that previous winter.\n\nWilliams certainly has spoken of the physical while straining to three defeats in Grand Slam finals since Sept. 1, 2017, when she gave birth. Briefly unable to remember dropping a 2018 Wimbledon final against Angelique Kerber, Williams said Thursday night, \u201cOh. That doesn\u2019t count. God, I had, like, an eight-month-old.\u201d\n\nYet while moving into another final at 37 opposite the 19-year-old Canadian revelation Bianca Andreescu, Williams has mentioned the emotional roadblocks. At one point in a considerable description of what Shriver calls \u201ca very unusual workplace juggle,\u201d Williams told of a worry many might not have pinpointed:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her to forget me.\u201d\n\n[At U.S. Open, Althea Gibson statue has become an essential stop]\n\n\u201cThe first months are very difficult after the birth,\u201d said Williams\u2019s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, soon adding, \u201cShe was feeling that the baby needed her a lot because a young baby is very weak, and I think as a mother you feel like you need to be here all the time to protect the baby. Whenever she was not here because she needed to practice or to play a match, she was feeling guilty \u2026 Not that it\u2019s not a priority now, but now she feels less guilty about leaving to play tennis, because she feels [her daughter] doesn\u2019t depend as much on her as when she was really small. So maybe this I would not expect.\u201d\n\nUnlike Court or Goolagong or Clijsters, who all gave birth in their 20s before resuming, or Williams, who gave birth at 35 before resuming, Evert and Shriver played long careers, stopped for good and then became mothers, Evert first at 36, Shriver at 42. Each has three children, Evert\u2019s in their 20s, Shriver\u2019s in their teens.\n\n\u201cI have to say,\u201d Evert said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect when Serena got pregnant and was going to have a baby and come back because I thought, \u2018Ohhhh, you have no idea.\u2019 You don\u2019t know the love. You\u2019ve never felt that kind of love before and that tugging at the heartstrings. So, you know, it\u2019s taken her a while. And it\u2019s still tough for her. But at least she\u2019s got a goal, so she\u2019s going for it.\u201d\n\nShriver marvels at the twin endurances going on as with Williams, calling motherhood \u201cone of the most endurance-ridden assignments that you have in life.\u201d She remembers finding it more routine as an 18-year-old in 1980, when Goolagong beat Evert, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), in the Wimbledon final \u2014 \u201cA fluke,\u201d Evert joked \u2014 and forged a conversation as the first mother since Dorothea Lambert Chambers in 1914 to win Wimbledon. Shriver then remembers feeling surprise that when Clijsters resurfaced in 2009, it had been \u2026\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine times four,\u201d Shriver said, noting the interim between Goolagong and Clijsters. \u201cWe\u2019re talking over a hundred, well over a hundred majors, and you think that, you know, not one mom won a singles major. Well, one of the things to me, it makes it difficult, is the choice women have to make is, if they\u2019re going to play a long, full career, you\u2019re missing prime time to have a baby.\n\n[Rafael Nadal rolls into U.S. Open semifinals]\n\n\u201cThat ended up happening to me where, because of my tennis, it just got really late in the game, and I ended up needing a lot of help to try to have [a baby]. It didn\u2019t just happen.\u201d\n\nEvert saw Goolagong, an athlete of rarefied ease, as a rarefied case: \u201cOnly Evonne, because she was just so carefree,\u201d and had a supportive husband.\n\nShe said to Shriver, \u201cCan you imagine playing?\u201d\n\nShriver: \u201cSome people would be better. Actually, I think about Martina [Navratilova], how she could compartmentalize, you know with whatever was going on.\u201d\n\nEvert: \u201cYeah. She\u2019s perfect. She\u2019s great at that. Yeah.\u201d\n\nShriver: \u201cI actually think she could have, had a difficult situation going on with your kid, whether it was a high fever or \u2026\u201d\n\nEvert: \u201cWhatever. Smoking weed, or whatever.\u201d\n\nShriver: \u201cDepending on the age. Smaller kids, smaller problems. Bigger kids, bigger problems.\u201d\n\nEvert: \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the sleeping issue. You have a baby. Or you have a young [child]. Hands-on. I had to be hands-on, 24 hours a day. That\u2019s just how I\u2019m different.\u201d\n\nShriver: \u201cYou want a baby that sleeps well. You want a baby that\u2019s easy to be put down to sleep and sleeps a lot.\u201d\n\nEvert: \u201cAnd that\u2019ll go with the dad.\u201d\n\nEven the decision to come back distinguishes those who do. \u201cOnce I had children,\u201d Evert said, \u201cI never wanted to do anything else but just be a mom. And I couldn\u2019t envision myself, I actually remember, I felt like, when I was pregnant \u2026 every woman is like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve never felt so good! And my skin, and my hair! And I have so much energy!\u2019 \u201d\n\nShriver laughed.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Evert said. \u201cI felt like \u2026 I don\u2019t know what word to use here. I was the opposite. I felt big and bloated and I didn\u2019t have energy and I just didn\u2019t feel great. So I kept thinking to myself, When I have this child, I\u2019m going to go play team tennis, because that was an option. I did. Yeah. I\u2019m going to go play some team tennis. I had talked to Billie Jean [King], and there\u2019s like three or four weeks in the summer, and I\u2019m going to go play. Once I had that baby, I was like, \u2018No team tennis. I want to be here 24 hours.\u2019 You know, I just wanted to be a mom. My nesting instincts took over. So that\u2019s why I admire Evonne, Margaret, Serena, I admire Kim Clijsters for being able to do that. I don\u2019t think I could do that. I feel like I could only do one thing well.\u201d\n\nIn that light, Williams didn\u2019t sound cheeky when she said, on her way to the final, \u201cYeah, I think it\u2019s cool that I\u2019ve been in more finals than I think anyone on tour after being pregnant. That\u2019s kind of awesome. That\u2019s currently on tour [smiling]. I kind of look at it that way because it\u2019s not easy to go through what I did and come back, and so fast. To keep playing, to also not be 20 years old, yeah, I\u2019m pretty proud of myself.\u201d", "description": "If she tops Bianca Andreescu in the U.S. Open final, she would become only fourth woman in open era to win a major after becoming a mom.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports.", "September At Pm", "Chuck Culpepper Covers National College Sports", "As Well As Some Tennis", "Some Golf"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aj-74VhH1NGNeJaoceZijxQtxeI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U33TZNWQ7UI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
