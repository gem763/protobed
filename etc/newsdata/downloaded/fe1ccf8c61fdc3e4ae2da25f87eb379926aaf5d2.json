Twelve of them had not, however.\n\nBefore and after treatment, stool samples were taken to analyse their gut bacteria, as well blood samples to check vitamin D levels.\n\nThe supplement group had sufficient levels of vitamin D while the remaining 12 did not.\n\nThe latter had 'significantly lower diversity and richness' in their gut at the beginning of the study.\n\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY? Vitamin D deficiency \u2013 when the level of vitamin D in your body is too low \u2013 can cause your bones to become thin, brittle or misshapen. Vitamin D also appears to play a role in insulin resistance, high blood pressure and immune function \u2013 and this relates to heart disease and cancer \u2013 but this is still being investigated. Low levels of the vitamin have also long been linked to an increased risk of multiple sclerosis. Although the amount of vitamin D adults get from their diets is often less than what's recommended, exposure to sunlight can make up for the difference. For most adults, vitamin D deficiency is not a concern. However, some groups \u2013 particularly people who are obese, who have dark skin and who are older than age 65 \u2013 may have lower levels of vitamin D due to their diets, little sun exposure or other factors.
