The single currency slipped to a fresh two-year low\n\npressured by an increasingly weak outlook for the euro zone.\n\nThe greenback also steadied against the Australian dollar,\n\nnear its strongest in three weeks, while it regained some ground\n\nhanded to the New Zealand dollar on Thursday.\n\n\"The positive U.S. dollar trend, with lots of noise in\n\nbetween it, remains intact,\" said Westpac analyst Imre Speizer\n\nin Auckland.\n\nHe added that risk aversion driven by trade war fears, a\n\nresilient U.S. economy and increasingly\n\nless-dovish-than-expected language from U.S. Federal Reserve\n\nboard members were supporting the greenback.\n\n\"There's a bit of political risk thrown in there as well via\n\nthe Middle East and Brexit,\" he said.\n\nThe pound wallowed at $1.2325, close to a two-week low hit\n\non Thursday after the European Union's Brexit negotiator said\n\nBritain had yet to provide \"legal and operational\" proposals for\n\nan agreement on exiting the bloc. Broader sentiment was fickle across markets. Positive\n\ncomments from the Chinese commerce ministry on progress in trade\n\nnegotiations had rallied European stocks overnight. [nL3N26H297\n\nRichmond Federal Reserve President Thomas I. Barkin said the\n\nU.S. economy looked strong and it was too early to tell whether\n\nfurther rate cuts were needed. But a Bloomberg report that said the United States was\n\nunlikely to extend a waiver over Huawei Technologies' blacklist\n\nweighed on U.S. equities.\n\nMarkets are also digesting the impeachment probe launched\n\ninto U.S. President Donald Trump, who went on the offensive as\n\ninvestors increasingly view the inquiry as a long-term drag\n\nrather than a short-term risk. The opening of the probe on Wednesday had initially knocked\n\nthe dollar, but it soon recovered and surged.\n\nThe dollar index , which measures the greenback\n\nagainst a basket of other currencies, rose overnight to its\n\nhighest since Sept. 3 and held near that mark on Friday at\n\n99.215.\n\n\"It seems that when push comes to shove, the USD remains the\n\nsafest place to be at the moment,\" said Rodrigo Catril, senior\n\nFX analyst at National Australia Bank in Sydney.\n\n\"In addition to its prime reserve currency status, the\n\ngreenback is still benefiting from a yield supremacy and a U.S.\n\neconomy that is still performing relatively well.\"\n\nElsewhere, the Australian dollar AUD=D3 was firmer at\n\n$0.6754, but only marginally as traders wait for a central bank\n\nmeeting next Tuesday where the Reserve Bank of Australia is\n\nwidely expected to cut interest rates. The New Zealand dollar NZD=D3 surrendered some of its\n\ngains won on Thursday, when Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor\n\nAdrian Orr was circumspect about the prospect of further\n\nmonetary easing to steady at $0.6295. The Chinese yuan CNH= eased in offshore trade to 7.1300\n\nper dollar.\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "FOREX-Dollar supported by safety flows; euro at new 2-year low", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/dollars_800x533_L_1411902913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
