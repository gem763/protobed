That seemingly self-opposing statement sums the debate between today\u2019s climate change doomsayers and doom deniers \u2013 with one side steadily upping the \u201cend of the world\u201d rhetoric while the other retorts, \u201cI feel fine.\u201d\n\nPredictions of our demise due to radical changes in weather are nothing new. Many times we\u2019ve been told by media, pundits and scientists alike that the end is near. Announcements that we\u2019re going to fry, freeze, be stricken with acid rain or worse have been around for decades. But today\u2019s versions of climate change alarmists, culminating in young Greta Thunberg\u2019s scolding of world leaders this week, have taken to selling such a dire, apocalyptic view of our future (in the absence of \u201cdrastic action\u201d) that writers of Mad Max movies must wonder just what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nA few more recent examples:\n\nIn February 2018, while speaking to students at Georgetown University Hillary Clinton had this to say, \u201cI would say that particularly for women, you\u2019re absolutely right, they will bear the brunt of looking for the food, looking for the firewood, looking for the place to migrate to when all of the grass is finally gone as the desertification moves south and you have to keep moving your livestock or your crops are no longer growing, they\u2019re burning up in the intense heat\u2026\u201d\n\nHow many women have livestock to move? Most women in American currently get their food from places like Safeway, Kroger, Publix, Walmart, Aldi and Cub Foods. Are Piggly Wiggly\u2019s going to somehow cease to exist in the future? If so, what\u2019s going to happen to them?\n\nNot content with \u201cin the future\u201d, earlier this year everyone\u2019s favorite nutso quote machine, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, decided it\u2019s time to put a(nother) time stamp on our demise when in January she proclaimed, \u201c\u2026the world is gonna end in twelve years if we don\u2019t address climate change.\"\n\nWhat does \u201cthe world is going to end\u201d actually mean? Apparently that twelve-year stake was a marker for others to best.\n\nA few months later, in April, everyone\u2019s second favorite nutso quote machine Beto O\u2019Rourke lopped off a couple of years when he declared we actually only have 10 years left. Appearing on MSNBC O\u2019Rourke told interviewer Chris Hayes that he wants \u201c\u2026to make sure that those who work in the oil and gas industry \u2014 those who work in the fossil fuel industry \u2014 are brought along as partners to make sure that we make this transition in the ten years we have left to us.\u201d\n\nSo now we\u2019re down to ten.\n\nThe DNC made the decision that its presidential primary debates would only be held on friendly networks, so thus far in 2019 we\u2019ve been treated to a bevy of softball questions asked by leftist moderators. NBC News hosted the June debate in Miami Florida. That night rather than simply asking candidate Jay Inslee about his climate change plans, Rachel Maddow prefixed her question in this fashion, \u201cHere in Miami, which is already experiencing serious flooding on sunny days, as a result of sea level rise. Parts of Miami Beach and the Keys could be underwater in our lifetimes. Does your plan save Miami?\u201d\n\nThis serious sunny day flooding in Miami is one of the best-kept news secrets of the decade. Of course Inslee answered \u201cyes\u201d, his plan will save Miami. Sadly for Miami\u2019s residents Inslee has dropped out of the race, thus potentially sealing their doom.\n\nIf this news wasn\u2019t dire enough along came AOC for round two. Earlier this month, on September 12, she dropped the final bomb on poor Miami \u2013 it only has three years left. Speaking at an NAACP forum the freshman legislator proclaimed, \u201cWe need to be realistic about the problem.\u201d What\u2019s the reality? \u201cWhen it comes to climate change, what is not realistic is not responding with a solution on the scale of the crisis \u2014 because what's not realistic is Miami not existing in a few years.\"\n\nApparently the NFL\u2019s Miami Dolphins and MLB\u2019s Florida Marlins are soon to literally become the NFL\u2019s dolphins and MLB\u2019s marlins.\n\nWhich brings us back to Greta Thunberg and the most recent calculations of world demise. How a 16-year old gets on the stage a United Nations summit and lectures heads of state is perplexing enough, but in her impassioned speech yesterday Thunberg stated, \u201c\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood... We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?\"\n\nSecond only to the vanishing of Miami, these mass extinctions are perhaps the second best-kept news secret of the decade. Not taking lessons from \u201cThe Boy Who Cried Wolf\u201d, today\u2019s doomsayers seem determined to continually up the ante, by Christmas they may be claiming we only have until New Year\u2019s Day left.\n\nDerrick Wilburn is the founder and Executive Director of the Rocky Mountain Black Conservatives and a fellow at the Centennial Institute in Colorado.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world as we know it, .09/25/2019 0:38:53AM EST.", "authors": ["Derrick", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/b5cc3fd1-b451-4db4-8a0f-53f1e9a00313.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
