Photo: Courtesy Snowe Home\n\nThese days, you can hardly take the subway in New York without running into an ad for a new bedding start-up that promises premium-quality, hotel-style sheets at direct-to-consumer prices. Linen sheets, in particular, are enjoying a bit of a moment, thanks to upstarts like Snowe, Parachute, and Brooklinen \u2014 all offering their own versions of the laid-back, rumpled fabric that still gives your bed an intentional look. With so many styles out there \u2014 a crisp cotton percale, a silky sateen, or something in between \u2014 we reached out to design experts and tastemakers for their recommendations on the best bedsheets to buy, from classic, white Egyptian cotton to ecofriendly linen to completely bespoke. (We also found the best-reviewed bedsheets on Amazon, if you\u2019re interested.)\n\nBest cotton percale sheets\n\nMatouk Scallop Full/Queen Embroidered 350 Thread Count Flat Sheet $93 (was $109, now 15% off) $93 at Neiman Marcus Buy with code: NMFRIEND\n\nMatouk was by far the most recommended sheets by our experts, with five designers calling it their favorite company for beautiful, high-quality sheets. \u201cMy favorite sheets are Matouk, mostly because everything\u2019s customizable, from the color of the threading to the monogram and the ruffles,\u201d says designer Sasha Bikoff, who keeps coming back to one specific style: \u201cIt\u2019s this very Hollywood Regency scallop-shell pattern that\u2019s kind of Miami-influenced too.\u201d Designer Lindsey Coral Harper also loves Matouk\u2019s assortment of scalloped edges, saying that Matouk bedding is a good option if you want something classic with a \u201cmodern twist.\u201d \u201cTheir percale is also one of my favorites to sleep on, and they mix and match very well,\u201d she says. Matouk\u2019s percale sheets are also interior designer Anne Hepfer\u2019s go-to sheets when she\u2019s looking for that \u201cultimate luxury\u201d quality and feel. \u201cMatouk\u2019s Sierra cotton percale sheets are a beautiful, classic base that can pair with any bedding,\u201d she says. Designer Vicente Wolf prefers their Meridian sheets, his go-to sheets for most of his projects. \u201cThere\u2019s something uniquely versatile about them \u2014 they\u2019re sophisticated enough for city life, but even in a country home they works perfectly against a more rustic backdrop,\u201d he says. \u201cI never second-guess these sheets.\u201d Matouk\u2019s linens are among Okin\u2019s favorite sheets as well.\n\nMarimekko Ajo 200 Thread Count Cotton Sheet Set According to Wood, percale sheets are great if you run hot when you sleep. \u201cWhile the thread count is lower, the sheets are crisp, cool, and more breathable.\u201d She recommends trying them in a fun print, like these striped ones from Finnish design house Marimekko. From $50 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nSnowe Percale Sheet Set, full A more affordable but still high-quality set of cotton-percale sheets comes from Snowe, recommended by Kai Avent-deLeon, owner of Sincerely, Tommy. \u201cI really liked Snowe\u2019s dinnerware, so I started using their sheets, too, and I\u2019ve found that they\u2019re really good-quality and decently priced,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re cotton, which is the only material I buy now, and they\u2019re really soft, kind of plush. They\u2019re breathable and low-maintenance, so I don\u2019t have to constantly clean them even though I buy an off-white color.\u201d These have a higher thread count than the Marimekko and Ralph Lauren sheets, making them particularly well-priced. $188 at Snowe Buy\n\nWilliams Sonoma Chambers Cane Embroidery Sheet Set If you want to add a little more texture to your percale sheets, consider this set from Williams Sonoma, recommended by interior designer Maggie Griffin. They\u2019re embroidered with the \u201clines of classic cane wickerwork\u201d that give them just the right touch of graphic detailing. \u201cThe bright white with intricate threading is just gorgeous,\u201d she says. From $120 at Williams Sonoma Buy\n\nThreshold Vintage Washed Sheets $25 (was $28, now 11% off) For a set of percale sheets that feel lived-in, consider these vintage washed sheets from Target. They\u2019re a personal favorite of designer Ashley Moore, who says that the wash makes them \u201csuper soft.\u201d She loves that they come in a variety of colors and patterns, and that the fitted sheets \u201cwill fit around deep mattresses and stay put.\u201d Plus, for a queen set going for under $50, \u201cyou cannot beat the price.\u201d From $25 at Target Buy\n\nJohn Robshaw Kama Sheet Set, Queen $300 (was $390, now 23% off) \u201cMy projects have intricate layers of color and pattern, but when it comes to sheets, I tend to veer towards easy, boho vibes,\u201d says interior designer Rayman Boozer of Apartment 48. He likes John Robshaw bedding, and his go-to colors are pale blues, pinks, and grays. Writer Kate Betts also vouches for Robshaw\u2019s bedding, which she first discovered at a friend\u2019s house in the South of France. She admits that they\u2019re pricey, \u201cbut the soft cotton and unusual colors and the way that each pattern evokes an exotic Rajasthan dreamscape make them worth it.\u201d $300 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nFrette Hotel Classic Sheet Set (Queen) $338 (was $450, now 25% off) Of course, you can\u2019t talk fancy sheets without mentioning Frette, which was recommended by two of our experts. It comes as no surprise that they also happen to be the most-recommended sheets by hotel insiders, too. Says Michael Shome, director of photography at Architectural Digest: \u201cMy absolute favorite sheets are the hotel classic from Frette, which are kind of like the fantasy version of Upper East Side hotel-bed linens. They\u2019re Italian-made in this Egyptian cotton that\u2019s just the softest and butteriest fabric to laze around in. I love the chic and simple double-line embroidery, too.\u201d Frette is among Okin\u2019s go-to sheets when she\u2019s looking for something classic. $338 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy $450 at Frette Buy\n\nBest linen sheets\n\nBrooklinen Linen Core Sheet Set Wood also loves Brooklinen\u2019s Luxe Hardcore set, but for a bit more of an \u201cunexpected\u201d look in the bedroom, she recommends trying their linen set. We agree \u2014 Brooklinen is among some of our favorite (affordable) linen sheets. Writer Lauren Levy says that they are \u201cso cozy and so soft\u201d and have \u201can immediately worn-in feel that only gets softer over time and with each wash.\u201d From $224 at Brooklinen Buy\n\nCultiver Linen Sheet Set These linen sheets from Cultiver, though they\u2019re definitely on the pricey side, also come highly recommended. Interior designer Tali Roth loves an effortless \u201ccrushed and casual look\u201d with her linen bedding and turns to Cultiver for their \u201cgorgeous assortment of colors\u201d and range of accessories that help pull the look of an entire bedroom together. Interior designer Tina Rich agrees, saying that \u201ctheir bedding instantly creates a cozy, relaxed vibe in any space.\u201d She adds that the sheets are supersoft, are of great quality, and come in a range of colors. Her favorites are dusk, smoke gray, and sage. \u201cI always suggest Cultiver to my client and also use them in my own home,\u201d she says. Our editors agree that if you\u2019re looking for unusual colors in a softer wash than other linen sheets, Cultiver is your best bet. From $315 at Cultiver Buy\n\nParachute Linen Sheet Set Fitted Sheet + Pillowcase (Queen) Top Chef judge Gail Simmons turns to Parachute for linen sheets \u201cthat won\u2019t cost you a crazy amount.\u201d Our editors agree, calling Parachute the best all-around company offering linen sheets for its \u201cmiddle-of-the-road price, the substantial feel of the linen, and the color options.\u201d $169 at Parachute Buy\n\nBella Notte Frida Linen Fitted Sheet Maria Augusta Louro also recommends sheets by Bella Notte, but she prefers their linen bedding, saying that while sleeping on 500-thread-count Egyptian cotton is nice, there\u2019s nothing like sleeping on pure linen, which to her feels so \u201cfresh.\u201d She especially loves the lace detailing on the pillowcase and says that the collection is \u201celegant, delicate, made under humane conditions, colored using low-impact dyes, and contains or emits the lowest possible levels of toxins.\u201d $282 at ABC Carpet & Home Buy\n\nLinge Particulier Linen Flat Sheet, Anthracite Gingham \u201cMy go-to and most beloved collection of bed linens are produced by a company named Linge Particulier,\u201d says Jenny Dina Kirschner, principal of JDK Interiors. The sheets are made of 100 percent soft, ecofriendly, biodegradable washed linen, and come in an array of rich, earthy tones and \u201cthe most beautiful vivid colors.\u201d Kirschner loves that they\u2019re breathable and help regulate body temperature, noting that the texture on the skin is especially nice. Though they are expensive, she loves how \u201clow maintenance\u201d they are: \u201cThey can be washed and tossed in the dryer and do not ever require ironing, unlike a more traditional crisp, cotton duvet and sheeting that wrinkles after one night of use.\u201d From $225 at Collyer\u2019s Mansion Buy\n\nBest sateen sheets\n\nPure Beech 100% Modal Sateen Sheet Set (Queen) These 100 percent modal sheets from Pure Beech are made in a sateen weave that feels silky and \u201csuper comfy,\u201d according to designer Ariel Okin. These well-priced sheets were also recommended by interior designer Sheila Bridges, who says that they\u2019re \u201cmy softest sheets by far.\u201d She describes them as feeling \u201calmost feel like flannel, but very lightweight, so they\u2019re not as warm \u2014 just really soft and comfortable to the touch.\u201d Even though she has 20 other sets of sheets folded in her laundry closet, \u201cI\u2019ll take these off the bed, wash them, and put them back on.\u201d And since a queen-size sheet set is just $100, you can definitely stock up. From $100 at Bed Bath & Beyond Buy\n\nBrooklinen Luxe Hardcore Sheet Set in Smoke Stripe Brooklinen\u2019s sheets also came recommended by two of our experts, designers Molly Schoneveld and Modsy\u2019s Alessandra Wood, both of whom say that they\u2019re an excellent value. \u201cIt is really hard to beat the quality of these sheets for the price,\u201d says Schoneveld. \u201cThey feel like butter, and still look and feel great after many times in the wash.\u201d She loves them so much that she uses them in her master and guest bedrooms. From $219 at Brooklinen Buy\n\nThe Company Store Wrinkle-Free 300-Thread Count Cotton Sateen Sheet Set These 300-thread-count sheets from the Company Store are wrinkle-free and come recommended by designer Crystal Sinclair, who says she always goes for classic white. \u201cThey\u2019re always crisp and never fade,\u201d she says, unlike dyed sheets. If you want to go a step up, there\u2019s a more expensive 450-thread-count option, but you have to buy the pieces separately. From $108 at The Company Store Buy\n\nHill House Home Savile Quick Snooze Sheet Set Designer Hilary Matt\u2019s favorite sheets are the Saville sheets from Hill House Home. \u201cI love the crisp and clean hotel look they have when your bed is made up,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel good and are supersoft and luxurious.\u201d She also appreciate the fact that you can customize them with your initials. Hill House Home is among Okin\u2019s favorite luxury sheets, too. From $250 at Hill House Home Buy\n\nSavoy Embroidered Sheet Set Here\u2019s another set of premium cotton-sateen sheets, this time by way of interior designer Maggie Griffin, who recommends Serena and Lily bedding to many of her clients \u201cfor their crisp whites, pretty embroideries, and beautiful colors.\u201d She particularly likes this embroidered set, which she\u2019s owned for a few years and says are \u201cstill so pretty.\u201d From $258 at Serena & Lily Buy\n\nBest alternative-fiber sheets\n\nBedVoyage Bamboo Rayon Sheet Set (Queen, Ivory) \u201cI recently used bamboo linens for a large project and I will definitely be using them more going forward,\u201d says Anishka Clarke, co-owner of Ishka Designs. \u201cBamboo is one of the strongest and hardest natural materials, and yet when you feel the fibers on these sheets, it\u2019s just incredibly soft. Softer than you\u2019d imagine. Supersoft. Like, baby-soft on your skin.\u201d But since they are made of this strong bamboo, she adds, the sheets are \u201cextremely durable \u2014 it generally lasts about two times longer than cotton sheets. It\u2019s usually more expensive, but overall quality and durability makes this the hands-down winner.\u201d $148 at Amazon Buy $148 at Amazon Buy\n\nMellanni Bed Sheet Set Moore loves the Mellanni sheets from Amazon \u2014 which has over 60,000 reviews \u2014 for a number of reasons, number one being the price tag. \u201cYou cannot beat these for the price,\u201d she says. According to Moore, they\u2019re made from a brushed microfiber that\u2019s \u201csupersoft.\u201d \u201cIf you read all the reviews, you\u2019ll hear almost everyone say the same thing. That\u2019s why we have these in every guest bedroom in our home.\u201d From $29 at Amazon Buy From $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: Ro, Lauren Comphy Sheet Set \u201cFor years, I\u2019ve been using Comphy as my go-to for bright-white, wrinkle-free, supersoft sheets,\u201d says Caitlin Murray, founder and interior designer at Black Lacquer Design. They\u2019re made from microfiber twill that, according to the website, is comparable to 600-thread-count sheets. Comphy started as a hotel-spa line, so the sheets are \u201cextra-durable and stain-resistant,\u201d says Murray. Bonus: They\u2019re also recyclable. From $138 at Comphy Buy\n\nBella Notte Madera Luxe Fitted Sheet \u201cBella Notte is my favorite luxury bedding brand,\u201d says Murphy. She especially recommends their silky Madera sheets, calling them \u201cseriously divine.\u201d They\u2019re made from Tencel, a sustainable fiber that is soft and breathable like cotton. Murphy typically goes with white for her sheets, but she notes that Bella Notte \u201chas a curated selection of beautiful colors that are small-batch garment dyed.\u201d From $341 at Bella Notte Buy\n\nBest silk sheets\n\nIf you want to get your hands on silk bedding but find it too expensive to spring for an entire set, consider a silk pillowcase. \u201cYou don\u2019t end up with as many pillow creases, it\u2019s gentler on your skin, and your hair isn\u2019t as frizzy when you wake up,\u201d notes Zoe Mac, founder of Zoe Mac Design. And though she finds most of the silk pillowcases on the market \u201creally tacky,\u201d Mac recommends the ones from Kumi Kookoon. \u201cThey have this range of incredible colors. I use a really deep indigo-navy and it\u2019s a dream to sleep on. They\u2019re so soft and I really notice the difference when I wake up. My hair is not as crazy-bedhead in the morning and my skin feels better.\u201d Kumi Kokoon also makes flat silk sheets for less than $500, so you can sleep fully encased in silk if you want.\n\nThe Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
