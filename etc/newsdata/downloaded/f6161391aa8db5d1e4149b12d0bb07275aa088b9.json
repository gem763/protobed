Sign up here.\n\nChinese and U.S. officials are struggling to agree on the schedule for a planned meeting this month to continue trade talks after Washington rejected Beijing\u2019s request to delay tariffs that took effect over the weekend, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nDespite efforts by President Donald Trump to soothe financial markets and portray the talks as making progress, the world\u2019s two biggest economic powers have yet to agree on basic terms of re-engagement, with mistrust on both sides.\n\nThe date for a visit of Chinese officials to the U.S. capital hasn\u2019t been set, though that\u2019s not necessarily a sign it still won\u2019t happen, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. U.S. equity futures fell on the news, touching their lows for the day.\n\nIn conversations over the past week, the two sides have failed to agree on at least two requests -- an American appeal to set some parameters for the next round of talks and a Chinese call to delay new tariffs, two of the people said. Trump went ahead anyway with tariffs on Sunday, doubling down on a strategy that seems to be having the opposite of the desired effect.\n\nChinese state media reacted by signaling the government is ready to weather the economic turbulence. Beijing then said it planned to file a complaint at the World Trade Organization against the U.S. tariffs under the dispute settlement process, according to a Ministry of Commerce statement late Monday.\n\n\u201cIt is time the U.S. administration reconsidered its poorly thought out China-bashing moves,\u201d an editorial in the China Daily argued. \u201cWorking to secure a trade deal would be a more fruitful approach.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about a meeting date.\n\nSome Trump administration officials are trying to keep talks from breaking down because global financial markets are moving with every positive and negative twist in a trade war that looks likely to extend into Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign. The S&P 500 Index dropped 1.8% last month and U.S. Treasury yields have plunged amid uncertainty that\u2019s hurting American companies and starting to chip away at consumer confidence.\n\n\"China is moving along, we\u2019re doing very well,\" Trump told reporters over the w. \u201cWe are talking to China, the meeting is still on as you know, in September. That hasn\u2019t changed -- they haven\u2019t changed it, we haven\u2019t. We\u2019ll see what happens. But we can\u2019t allow China to rip us off anymore as a country.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on the discussions.\n\nTrump has expressed frustration that the talks haven\u2019t brought the sides closer to a deal, even threatening last week that if he can\u2019t deliver a better agreement in the U.S.\u2019s economic relationship with China, then \u201clet\u2019s not do business together. I don\u2019t want to do business.\u201d\n\nMaking Excuses\n\nHis finger-pointing has extended beyond China. On Friday he lashed out at American businesses for complaining about the rising cost of the import taxes he has now placed on some $360 billion of Chinese imports, accusing them of bad corporate management.\n\nThe new 15% U.S. duty on about $112 billion of Chinese products will hit Americans more directly than an existing 25% tax on about $250 billion of goods, targeting consumer staples ranging from footwear and apparel to home textiles, as well as technology products like the Apple Watch. A separate batch of about $160 billion in Chinese goods -- including laptops and mobile phones -- will be hit with 15% tariffs on Dec. 15.\n\nFor their part, Chinese officials don\u2019t want to be seen as succumbing to strong-arm tactics like tariffs and are wary about setting a meeting date because of Trump\u2019s tendency to change tack via surprises on Twitter.\n\nGeng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, told a briefing in Beijing on Monday that \u201cthe most important thing at present is to create the necessary conditions for continuing the trade talks between China and the United States.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s export-driven economy is more exposed to the trade war than the U.S., and the toll tariffs are taking is increasingly evident. The nation\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index dropped to 49.5, according to data released Saturday by the National Bureau of Statistics, with sub-gauges showing that domestic and new overseas orders contracted.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
