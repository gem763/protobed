The Dutch rider has been in scintillating form this season and won the cyclo-cross world title among his many achievements, so the road race crown would complete a rare double.\n\nThere are plenty of other challengers, like the Belgian cohort of Greg Van Avermaet, Philippe Gilbert and young Remco Evenepoel, while the Italian Matteo Trentin always enjoys long routes like this one.\n\nThe weather is also likely to be something of a leveller. It is set to rain for much of the morning while the wind across the Yorkshire moors has proved decisive in several races already this week.\n\nBut even so, Alaphilippe will take some stopping. He carried similar expectations last year and failed to deliver, but with a brilliant summer behind him and French team geared towards his success, this might just be his time.\n\nPrediction\n\nMathieu van der Poel to go close but ultimately Julian Alaphilippe to be too strong, kicking away before Harrogate and holding on through the seven laps of the circuit.\n\nStart time\n\nThe race is set to start at around 9.30am in Leeds, with an estimated finish time of around 3pm.\n\nRoad closures\n\nLocation Race arrival Road closure Leeds 8:40am 4am to 12noon Cookridge 9am 8:30am to 9:30am Otley 9:09am 8:40am to 9:40am Ilkley 9:21am to 9:23am 8:50am to 9:50am Addingham 9:27am to 9:29am 9am to 10am Skipton 9:40am to 9:44am 9:10am to 10:10am Ryleston 9:51am to 9:56am 9:20am to 10:20am Kilnsey 10:04am to 10:10am 9:30am to 10:30am Kettlewell 10:11am to 10:18am 9:40am to 10:40am Starbotton 10:15am to 10:22am 9:45am to 10:45am Cray 10:23am to 10:31am 8:30am to 11:30am Kidstones Summit 10:23am to 10:31am 8:30am to 11:30am Bishopdale 10:29am to 10:38am 8:30am to 11:30am Newbiggin 10:37am to 10:46am 10:05am to 11:05am Aysgarth 10:43am to 10:53am 10:30am to 11:40am Bainbridge 10:51am to 11:04am 10:30am to 11:40am Hawes 11:01am to 11:13am 10:30am to 11:40am Buttertubs Summit 11:10am to 11:22am 08:30am to 12:30am Muker 11:17am to 11:30am 10:50am to 12:20pm Gunnerside 11:23am to 11:37am 10:50am to 12:20pm Reeth 11:36am to 11:51am 10:50am to 12:20pm Grinton Moor Summit 11:43am to 11:59am 9am to 1pm Leyburn 11:51am to 12:09pm 11:20am to 12:40pm Middleham 11:57am to 12:13pm 11:20pm to 12:40pm East Witton 12:01pm to 12:18pm 11:20am to 12:40pm Masham 12:14pm to 12:33pm 11:45am to 1pm West Tanfield 12:22pm to 12:42pm 11:45am to 1pm Ripon 12:34pm to 12:55pm 12noon to 1:15pm Wormald Green 12:43pm to 1:04pm 12:20pm to 1:40pm Ripley 12:51pm to 1:13pm 12:20pm to 1:40pm Killinghall 12:53pm to 1:15pm 12:20pm to 1:40pm New Park 12:55pm to 1:38pm 12:20pm to 1:40pm Ripon Road sector 10:30am to 6pm Harrogate Circuit 1 12:58pm to 1:21pm 10:30am to 6pm Harrogate Circuit 2 1:37pm to 1:41pm 10:30am to 6pm Harrogate Circuit 3 1:35pm to 2:01pm 10:30am to 6pm Harrogate Circuit 4 1:52pm to 2:20pm 10:30am to 6pm Harrogate Circuit 5 2:11pm to 2:40pm 10:30am to 6pm Harrogate Circuit 6 2:29pm to 3pm 10:30am to 6pm Harrogate Circuit 7 2:47pm to 3:20pm 10:30am to 6pm\n\nFollow the race here live with our latest updates.", "description": "Julian Alaphilippe will be the man to beat in the final instalment of the 2019 UCI Road World Championships, Sunday\u2019s elite men\u2019s road race.\u00a0 The French rider lit up the Tour de France this summer with his brand of aggressive riding, wearing the yellow jersey for most of the three weeks only to finally break in the giant Alpine mountains.", "authors": ["Lawrence Ostlere"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/30/16/Tour-de-France-2019-77.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
