It\u2019s where odours, once inhaled, are given context and meaning, then filed away as part of our personal history.\n\nIt\u2019s why seemingly ordinary sensory details \u2013 freshly mowed grass, drops of rain \u2013 can throw us into a tumult of nostalgia, why a spritz of your grandmother\u2019s signature scent is strangely transcendent. Memories surface when we smell whatever gripped us at the time. It\u2019s one reason the global fragrance industry is valued at $56 billion \u2013 our deepest emotions are swirling around in those bottles.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that early-childhood memories are behind two of the world\u2019s most famous fragrances: Coco Chanel\u2019s iconic No. 5 and Christian Dior\u2019s first fragrance, Miss Dior. They\u2019re both inspired by gardens the fashion designers spent time in as children.\n\nChanel\u2019s rose garden was located in a convent orphanage in central France, where she lived from age 12 after her mother\u2019s death. Dior\u2019s roses, meanwhile, were planted by his mother at the family\u2019s holiday house on the cliffs of Normandy.\n\nCoco Chanel\u2019s iconic No. 5 was inspired by the roses in the garden of the convent orphanage she lived in.\n\nThese beginnings have been woven into the mythology of both brands, with great success. This June, Chanel released its annual earnings for 2018; total sales exceeded $US11 billion ($16.3 billion), thanks in large part to the growth of its fragrance and beauty sector.\n\nChanel\u2019s longevity lies largely in its ability to layer modern interpretations over traditional product lines. The late Karl Lagerfeld knew this better than most: Chanel No. 5 never dies, it only morphs into moisturiser, shower gel and hair mist, before it splinters again into triplets: \u201cThe Woody\u201d, \u201cThe Fresh\u201d and \u201cThe Sensual\u201d, varieties of No. 5 that were released in 2016.\n\nMiss Dior was named after the designer's sister, Catherine, a spy in World War II who was captured and sent to a German concentration camp.\n\nThrough it all, the mythology remains. Few are unfamiliar with the story. It was 1920, dawn of the Jazz Age, and Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel wanted a fragrance for the modern woman. Her perfumer, Russian-born chemist Ernest Beaux, handed her vials with differing scents \u2013 and she picked the fifth one.\n\nChanel unofficially launched No. 5 in 1921 in a restaurant in Grasse, France. It\u2019s the same place Dior\u2019s roses are harvested today (nine kilos of pink petals for one bottle, in fact) for a scent whose moniker emerged from heroism during wartime.", "description": "It takes more than the link between memory and smell to keep a luxury fragrance making millions for decades \u2013 or even centuries \u2013 after it was created.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2825%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_427/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/77d2a64107d26b107bcdb155b744fed38c78d3ab", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
