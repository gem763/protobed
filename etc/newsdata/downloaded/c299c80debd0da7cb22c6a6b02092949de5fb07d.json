The California camera company has packed a lot into the same flagship price point of $399, with a new integrated mounting system, a refreshed software experience that requires fewer taps, and the ability to shoot up to 4K footage at 60 frames per second or capture startlingly steady footage, thanks to an improved version of the company\u2019s HyperSmooth digital image stabilization.\n\nThe Hero 8 Black is available to order today, October 1st, and it starts shipping on October 15th. It will sit alongside GoPro\u2019s new $499 360-degree camera, the Max, and the Hero 7 Black, which now costs $299. The Hero 7 Silver will round out GoPro\u2019s lineup at $199, while the Hero 7 White is being discontinued.\n\nThe Hero 8 Black costs $399, and there are now \u201cmod\u201d accessories\n\nThe Hero 8 Black looks very similar to its most recent predecessors, but those looks deceive. In fact, there are a lot of little changes that should add up to create a much different experience when compared to past Hero cameras.\n\nOne of the biggest is that the Hero 8 Black has optional \u201cMods,\u201d which will let users tack on accessories like a GoPro-designed microphone, an LED light, or a flip-up screen. (More on those here.) But for people who just care about the camera itself, this is what\u2019s in store.\n\nThe biggest change to the physical design of the camera this year is that it can now be mounted to any GoPro mount on its own, without a housing of any kind. GoPro took the two mounting \u201cfingers\u201d that slot into the company\u2019s mounts and integrated them into the body. They snap down when you\u2019re ready to mount the camera, but they flip up flush to the body (and are held in place by magnets) when you want to use the Hero 8 Black on its own.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lens of the Hero 8 Black doesn\u2019t protrude quite as much as the one on the Hero 7 Black, and it\u2019s also not removable. GoPro says it made the glass twice as hard as the glass on the Hero 7 Black, so it shouldn\u2019t need to be replaced.\n\nThe Hero 8 Black also uses a new battery, GoPro\u2019s first in years. It\u2019s the same shape and capacity, but it\u2019s more powerful. The new camera can draw power out of the new battery at a faster rate in order to help with some of the most intense shooting modes.\n\nOn the software side, GoPro\u2019s executed a number of impressive changes. Front and center is the new version of HyperSmooth. The digital image stabilization feature that made its debut on last year\u2019s Hero 7 Black garnered pretty rave reviews by making footage look super smooth without lots of noticeable warping or loss of resolution. GoPro has pushed the envelope even more with HyperSmooth 2.0, though. Footage shot on the Hero 8 Black with the new HyperSmooth enabled makes Hero 7 Black footage look almost jittery. GoPro teased the ability to ditch a handheld stabilizer last year, but this year, the company really means it.\n\nGoPro also built in more control over HyperSmooth, with the ability to set it to \u201chigh\u201d or even turn on a \u201cboost\u201d mode that crops in even tighter for extra-stable footage. Best of all, HyperSmooth is now available in all shooting modes.\n\nHypersmooth got even better\n\nThe company was able to improve HyperSmooth in part by changing the way the image sensor interacts with GP1, the company\u2019s custom-made processing chip. The Hero 8 Black is the third camera to use GP1, and the improvements to HyperSmooth show there\u2019s a lot more the company can do to exploit owning more of the image processing stack, according to Pablo Lema, GoPro\u2019s vice president in charge of product management and user experience.\n\nThe HyperSmooth-aided \u201cTime Warp\u201d feature that GoPro debuted on the Hero 7 Black gets its own refresh on the Hero 8 Black, too. It will now automatically adjust the speed of the footage based on data from the camera, and there\u2019s a new option to tap the touchscreen mid-Time Warp recording to snap into \u201creal time\u201d footage for when you want to focus on something instead of blowing right past it.\n\nGoPro also added a new Live Burst feature, which largely mimics Apple\u2019s Live Photos. In this mode, the camera saves 1.5 seconds\u2019 worth of still images before and after you hit the shutter button, making it harder to miss the exact shot you want.\n\nThe Hero 8 Black ticks pretty much every box when it comes to resolution and specs. It shoots 4K footage at up to 60 frames per second, including at 100 Mbps bitrate for the first time ever. It will shoot 240 frames per second at 1080p for super slow motion footage. The Hero 8 Black can live stream at 1080p, up from 720p on the Hero 7 Black.\n\nOne drawback to all these resolution and frame rate options is that it can be overwhelming. So GoPro added a \u201cpresets\u201d drawer that users can access with a quick swipe of the finger. The camera ships with four already dialed in, but they can be easily tweaked, and the camera can store up to 10 at a time. GoPro\u2019s ProTune settings are also now found here.\n\nNew customizable presets will make it easier to change multiple settings at once\n\n\u201cThe number one question we get in our customer support calls by a long shot is: \u2018What settings should I use for what?\u2019\u201d Lema told The Verge. \u201cOur cameras are very powerful devices. The permutations of frame rates, resolutions, and lenses, [turning] ProTune on or off. It\u2019s nauseating.\u201d Lema said his team \u201ctook whole brain trust of GoPro\u201d and boiled everyone\u2019s favorite settings down to the four presets that ship with the camera. \u201cThey\u2019re not meant to be exhaustive, but they\u2019re meant to be the first guiding suggestions from GoPro that says, \u2018These are how you should probably use the camera first.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn that same vein of emphasizing simplicity, GoPro has rebranded the different field of view options on the Hero 8 Black. It now refers to them as \u201cdigital lenses,\u201d and users can toggle between them with just a few taps, from super wide all the way to a more narrow view.\n\nOn the photo side, the Hero 8 Black captures 12-megapixel snaps, and users can now shoot RAW photos in time-lapse and burst modes instead of just in regular photo mode. The company says the Hero 8 Black\u2019s HDR photos will look much better now, too, because it\u2019s no longer using third-party processing algorithms to merge multiple photos, which was leading to \u201cghosting\u201d artifacts in pictures with movement\n\n\u201cWith Hero 7 Black, we were doing HDR in what I would say was an educated, but not super scientific, way,\u201d Lema said. \u201cBut with Hero 8 Black we\u2019ve truly changed the way we actually read the sensor to make it so that the HDR ghosting is almost completely eliminated.\u201d\n\nRelated GoPro CEO Nick Woodman on how the company is coming back into focus\n\nLast but not least, GoPro has once again overhauled its mobile app. It recently combined its Quik editing app with the main camera connection app to create one app that does pretty much everything. Lema calls it the \u201cbiggest software initiative we\u2019ve had at GoPro since we\u2019ve had a mobile app.\u201d\n\nA lot of these changes feel like they\u2019ve come from a place of confidence, which has not always been the case for GoPro over the last few years. The overwhelming success of the Hero 7 Black \u2014 it was GoPro\u2019s fastest-selling camera ever \u2014 has helped put distance between the company and more unstable times, like the recall and ultimate demise of its first and only drone, Karma; multiple rounds of layoffs; and the growth and subsequent culling of a crowded product lineup. The company also has its finances trending in the right direction, having recently upgraded its outlook for the second half of 2019.\n\nNow on solid ground, GoPro is obviously willing to try some new things, like releasing a new 360-degree camera into a market that isn\u2019t fully receptive to the idea, or investing money into developing a new system of Mods that could change how a GoPro gets used (and who buys them) or making tweaks to how a GoPro camera works. That approach will help GoPro fend off any new competitors (like DJI, which entered the action camera market this year) while staying strong as smartphone cameras get even better and more versatile.", "description": "GoPro\u2019s Hero 8 Black action camera was announced on Tuesday.
