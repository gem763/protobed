If downgraded to \u201cjunk\u201d, passive funds would automatically sell and cause a significant weakening of the currency.\n\nSo, 20 of 25 economists surveyed by Reuters in the past week expected the repo rate to be kept on hold at 6.50% next week when the Bank holds its penultimate meeting of the year, with a cut to 6.25% not expected until May 2020.\n\n\u201cWe expect the SARB to pause at the upcoming MPC meeting,\u201d said Elna Moolman, an economist at Standard Bank, citing the Moody\u2019s review, an upcoming budget and how a long-awaited turnaround plan for Eskom pans out as reasons.\n\nHowever, economists have said rate cuts won\u2019t necessarily change the face of a structurally hamstrung economy but rather soften the blow. A 25 basis point cut is predicted by the remaining five economists this month.\n\nThe central bank has room to move as inflation is expected to average 4.3 percent this year, just below the midpoint of the Bank\u2019s 3-6% target range.\n\n\u201cGiven the low inflation environment of contained electricity and food prices, another rate cut to 6.25% is likely in H1 2020, especially if we see a further escalation of the U.S.-China trade war,\u201d said Francesca Beausang, a senior economist at Continuum Economics.\n\nMinisters from Beijing and Washington are likely to meet in early October, presenting an opportunity for a trade deal but discussions have gone awry before and the rand could see some volatility before then.\n\nIn the meantime the rand ZAR=D3 is expected to keep clawing back losses made since the year began.\n\nGrowth is expected at 0.6 percent this year, accelerating to 1.3 percent next year, still not quite enough to get more South Africans into work. Almost a third of the labor force in Africa\u2019s most industrialized nation is jobless.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s ascension to power last year promised to attract much needed foreign investment that would create more jobs, but that has not yet happened.", "description": "The South African Reserve Bank will keep its repo rate unchanged on Sept. 19 despite a benign inflation outlook, a Reuters poll found, and any further rate cuts will likely hinge on a potentially game-changing credit rating review in November.", "authors": ["Vuyani Ndaba", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
