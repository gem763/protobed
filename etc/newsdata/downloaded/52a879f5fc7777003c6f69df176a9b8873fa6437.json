REUTERS/Axel Schmidt/Files\n\nConservative premier Kyriakos Mitsotakis was elected two months ago, replacing his leftist predecessor Alexis Tsipras on pledges to revamp Greece\u2019s economy a year after the end of its third international bailout.\n\nGreece remains under financial surveillance to ensure it meets its fiscal targets, and Mitsotakis says his government is confident of achieving a primary budget surplus \u2014 which excludes debt-servicing costs \u2014 of 3.5% of GDP in 2019 and 2020, as agreed with European lenders.\n\nHe hopes, however, that foreign creditors will be persuaded to lower that target to around 2% in 2021, after Athens gains credibility by implementing reforms such as modernising and making its state more efficient and cutting down on red tape.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s speech at an annual trade fair in the city of Thessaloniki, Mitsotakis is expected to reiterate that corporate tax will be cut to 24% in 2020 from 28% currently and to 20% in 2021, with taxation on dividends to be halved to 5%, government officials said.\n\nHe is also expected to announce measures to help ease the tax burden for certain groups of austerity-hit taxpayers and offer incentives to boost the construction sector.\n\nSecuring leeway from creditors on the primary budget surplus target would give Mitsotakis\u2019s administration scope to implement the tax cuts and boost public spending to spur growth in an economy that shrunk by a quarter during a long debt crisis.\n\nGreece has been exceeding its fiscal targets in recent years and European lenders expect the economy to grow by 2.2% in 2019.\n\nThe government also wants to resume talks with lenders on repaying earlier loans from the International Monetary Fund, officials said, finishing off a project the former government had started. Senior euro zone officials were neutral to positive this week to the plan presented by their Greek peer.\n\nMitsotakis visited Germany, France and the Netherlands in recent weeks to appeal to his European counterparts to support his campaign and also invest in Greece.\n\nThe prime minister is also expected during Saturday\u2019s speech to reiterate a government plan to revive a stalled gold mine project.\n\nOther initiatives that the government is keen to accelerate include a long-delayed tourist investment at a disused Athens airport and the sale of a stake at Greece\u2019s biggest oil refinery Hellenic Petroleum.", "description": "Greece's prime minister is expected on Saturday to detail tax cuts for companies strained by years of austerity, while also promising pro-business reforms aimed at convincing lenders to ease the nation's fiscal target from 2021.", "authors": ["Renee Maltezou", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427223823&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860FQ", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
