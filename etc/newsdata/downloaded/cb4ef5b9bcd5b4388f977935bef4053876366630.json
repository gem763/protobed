The dispute includes 28 local stations in major markets like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas-Fort Worth and others. Cable networks FS1, FS2, Big 10 Network, Fox Soccer Plus and Fox Deportes are also affected.\n\nThe companies had been making \u201csteady progress\u201d in negotiations, Dish said in a prepared statement. However, it accused FOX of asking for double-digit percentage rate increases to carry its local channels.\n\nA FOX Corporate spokesperson said Dish was forcing the network-owned channels off the air as a negotiating tactic.\n\n\u201cDish/Sling is at it again, choosing to drop leading programming as a negotiating tactic regardless of the impact on its own customers,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDish/Sling elected to drop FOX networks in an effort to coerce us to agree to outrageous demands. While we regret this is Dish/Sling\u2019s preferred approach to negotiating, we remind our loyal viewers that the FOX services are widely available through every other major television provider.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFOX Corporation is the parent company of FOX Business.\n\nAndy LeCuyer, Dish\u2019s senior vice president of programming, said FOX was trying to \u201cforce bundle\u201d its local channels with its cable networks for negotiating leverage right as the NFL and college football seasons are heating up.\n\n\u201cFOX is using local viewers as leverage to get more money for unrelated channels,\u201d LeCuyer said. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to use local viewers to raise rates on expensive, unrelated sports programming.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t Dish\u2019s only recent dispute with a channel provider. HBO has been off Dish for almost a year, and the satellite TV carrier reached a deal with Univision in March after nine months of negotiations. Meredith Corp., which owns stations in 12 markets, went dark on Dish in July.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The dispute affects 28 stations in 17 markets, plus five sports networks.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/04/0/0/Watching-TV-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
