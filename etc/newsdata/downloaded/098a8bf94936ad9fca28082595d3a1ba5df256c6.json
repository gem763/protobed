This Bill proposes amendments which would authorise the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to disclose information in order to participate in identity-matching services and provide for computerised decision-making in confirming identity.\n\nThis Bill would also support the objectives of the Identity-Matching Bill by making Australian travel document data available to identity-matching services via the Home Affairs-controlled interoperability hub.\n\nHastie said the committee heard concerns during its probe regarding the use of automated decision-making, in particular where unfavourable outcomes were made for the subject.\n\n\"Most felt that an element of human decision-making, should be kept and then avenues for review of decisions should be implicitly incorporated into the Bill,\" he explained.\n\n\"The committee agrees and recommends that the Bill should be amended to ensure that automated decision-making, can only be used for decisions that produce favourable or neutral outcomes for the subject, and that automated decisions should not negatively affect outcomes.\"\n\nHastie said the committee recognises that redrafting of the Identity Matching Bill may have consequential effects to the Passports Bill should, and as a result, the committee has asked it also be referred to the committee for further review.\n\nMeanwhile, ALP committee member Mark Dreyfus said that if the government has no intention of using the Bills for mass surveillance purposes that it should have no problem with accepting the committee's recommendations.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Bipartisan agreement that the Bills are not sufficient in their current forms.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/17/28e2f1bd-926b-44ed-a63e-322ce5501a83/thumbnail/770x578/9ecbb91d884d3864eccdc72f9b06c2f3/biometric.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
