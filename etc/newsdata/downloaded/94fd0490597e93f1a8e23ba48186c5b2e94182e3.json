Today, the company announced the appropriately named 8BitDo Lite, a rectangular gamepad that emulates the look of the Switch Lite so precisely that you might confuse it for a first-party Nintendo product. It\u2019s available in yellow and teal \u2014 sorry, gray Switch Lite owners \u2014 and features largely the same buttons and functionality as the built-in controls, except with a pair of D-pads in place of the joysticks.\n\nNow, you might be asking why you\u2019d need an extra for a device designed specifically for portable gaming. The most likely answer is for multiplayer play; if you want to get in some impromptu games of Mario Kart 8, you\u2019ll need a few controllers handy. And these are at least tiny enough to toss in a small bag. That may be a very specific use case, but the good thing is, like most 8BitDo products, the new controller works with a range of hardware beyond the Switch Lite, It also supports Windows, Mac, and Android.\n\nThe 8BitDo Lite starts shipping on October 30th, and it will cost $24.99. You can preorder on Amazon right now.", "description": "8BitDo has revealed a new controller that perfectly emulates the look of the Nintendo Switch Lite, giving players more options for multiplayer gaming.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2WW2ETy9DU2TIz8iagp6A67j4CM=/0x183:2560x1523/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19237935/1_8BitDo_Lite.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
