David walked down to the beach, where the waves were crashing over the sand\u2014up to the very edge.\n\n\u201cI was just standing down by the water, I went down to go see the water for a second. A little boy ran by and a rogue wave came up and snatched the little boy off his feet and started to take him out to the ocean,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s when he took action and rescued the boy, scooping him up out of the sea to safety.\n\n\u201cI just ran out five or ten feet, picked him up and got him back to safety,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut, he was pretty scared... he was crying when he was done.\u201d\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN LASHES FLORIDA'S ATLATNTIC COAST AFTER DECIMATING BAHAMAS\n\nTaylor said the family was standing 10 feet away from him, but it happened \u201cso fast.\u201d The family thanked him when he brought the boy back to shore.\n\nThe Taylors didn\u2019t know the family\u2014and say they still don\u2019t. The family left before they could get any names.\n\nEven so, this Palm Beach Gardens man in an instant went from a bystander at the beach to someone who stepped in to help.\n\n\u201cMakes me feel pretty good. I think anybody who was standing there would\u2019ve done the same thing, to see the terrified little boy, they would\u2019ve probably just jumped right in and done the same thing,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nHe said he\u2019s lived in the area for over five decades, understanding the ocean\u2019s temperament.\n\nHe also said people unfamiliar with the beach as storms approach should \u201cstay on dry land and look from afar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hurricane\u2019s gone, the elements are pretty much gone, but the ocean is still pretty fierce,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe National Weather Service said people in South Florida \"should continue to monitor weather conditions and follow the advice of local officials.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service Alert for South Florida as of Tuesday evening still said: \"The center of Hurricane Dorian continues its northwestward movement over the Atlantic waters east of Florida, slowly distancing itself from South Florida. Occasional tropical storm-force wind gusts from squalls are still possible over South Florida through this evening... A prolonged period of strong winds over the Atlantic coastal waters will cause very hazardous seas, rough surf, and beach erosion through the next few days.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJuno Beach experienced this first hand as people lined the coast to look at the erosion. Thankfully, Taylor was standing at the right place at the right time as that unexpected tide swept up the kid.\n\n\"I was just here, for whatever reason I was standing where God needed me at that time,\" Taylor said.", "description": "As people stood near\u00a0Juno Beach, about 20 minutes north of Palm Beach, with Hurricane Dorian moving north, some of them witnessed an emergency before their very eyes.", "authors": ["Charlie Lapastora", "Charlie Lapastora Joined Fox News In As A Multimedia Reporter Based In Phoenix."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/THUMBNAIL-RESCUE.jpg"}
