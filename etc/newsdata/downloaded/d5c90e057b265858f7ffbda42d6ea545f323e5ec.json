He deserves for us to know what happened to him. His story is unfinished \u2013 the mystery must be resolved. There are still so many closed doors, and we must have help in opening them.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raoul Wallenberg disappeared in 1945 after being summoned to Soviet military occupation headquarters in Budapest.

But Sweden does not push hard enough to obtain that material.\u201d\n\nBerger will accompany Von Dardel-Dupuy to Stockholm on 25 September to meet foreign ministry officials and MPs. She said: \u201cWe understand the pressures: we know it has to act with circumspection. But it could do far more.\u201d\n\nThe former Swedish prime minister, G\u00f6ran Persson (in office from 1996 to 2006) apologised unreservedly for his country\u2019s inertia over the case in 2001, noting that as long as there was \u201cno unequivocal evidence of what happened to Wallenberg \u2013 and this is still the case \u2013 it cannot be said he is dead\u201d.\n\nBut, Berger observed, in practice little has changed since then. She said Von Dardel-Dupuy would hand Swedish officials a letter formally asking them to submit an official request to Russian authorities for access to 10 key documents or files that researchers knew existed, and were \u201ccrucial to the investigation of Wallenberg\u2019s fate\u201d.\n\nBerger said the demand went to the heart of the current dispute with Swedish authorities. She said: \u201cRather than act itself, Sweden places the onus of finding the truth on the shoulders of researchers and Wallenberg\u2019s family \u2013 when it is quite clear that without official support this will always be an impossible task.\u201d\n\nRaoul Wallenberg was 31 when, in July 1944, he volunteered to travel as a diplomat to Hungary as part of a US-funded effort to protect the 200,000 Jews still living in Budapest. More than 400,000 outside the capital had already been transported to Nazi death camps.\n\nHe recruited 350 volunteers, rented 32 safe houses covered by diplomatic immunity, organised vital supplies of food and clothing, and issued thousands of \u201cletters of protection\u201d, official-looking documents that had no legal authority but were widely accepted by Hungarian and German officials, often with the aid of a bribe.\n\nJust six months after he arrived, however, Wallenberg \u2013 a member of the wealthy Swedish family of industrialists and bankers \u2013 himself became a victim. Invited to the Soviet military HQ in eastern Hungary, he was arrested and taken to Moscow.\n\nHis family have never received an official explanation for his detention, although suspicions he was also spying for the Americans, and his connections with some senior German politicians \u2013 he negotiated his humanitarian mission with, among others, Adolf Eichmann \u2013 have been suggested.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest From left: Louise Von Dardel, Matilda Von Dardel and Marie von Dardel-Dupuy in 2014 in Pully, Switzerland, with a letter asking the Russian president to open the archives to divulge Raoul Wallenberg\u2019s fate.

It was signed by the governor of the Lubyanka prison infirmary, claiming Wallenberg had died that night of a heart attack and that his body had been cremated.\n\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, however, Russian officials have also said \u2013 without evidence, and claiming variously that he was poisoned and shot \u2013 that the diplomat was summarily executed in 1947. Unconfirmed reports that Wallenberg was still alive continued to surface until the late 1980s.\n\nOver the decades, the uncertainty has taken its toll on Wallenberg\u2019s family. His mother, Maj, and stepfather, Fredrik von Dardel (his father died before he was born), devoted the rest of their lives to trying to discover the fate of their son, finally killing themselves two days apart in 1979.\n\nTheir son, Guy von Dardel, the diplomat\u2019s late half-brother, a particle physicist who helped establish Cern, sat on numerous commissions and travelled more than 50 times to Moscow, examining what records he could and compiling a 50,000-page dossier \u2013 but without ever uncovering any conclusive proof.\n\nHis daughters, Marie and Louise, now in their 60s, have also campaigned tirelessly, convinced the mystery could be solved within a year if Berger, her colleague Vadim Birstein and other Wallenberg experts had access to the relevant documents.\n\nAmong the classified records to which the historians want access are Soviet files on Willy Rodel, a German diplomat and Soviet informer who shared a cell with Wallenberg, and files that could help explain four days between Wallenberg\u2019s transfer from Lefortovo prison to Lubyanka when his whereabouts are unknown.\n\nOne Holocaust descendant's fight for justice: 'They stole not just our land, but my family's history' Read more\n\nThe researchers are also keen to see Red army \u2013 as opposed to military counter-intelligence \u2013 files relating to Wallenberg, as well as interviews with the diplomat\u2019s colleagues and Soviet intelligence reports on the wider Wallenberg family and its often controversial business interests.\n\nBut their main interest, said Birstein, a historian who was a member of the first international commission on Wallenberg in 1990, is in the records of prisoner No 7, a still unidentified prisoner who they know was interrogated, together with Wallenberg\u2019s driver, for more than 16 hours on 23 July 1947.\n\nIf, as researchers firmly believe, prisoner No 7 was actually Wallenberg, that means the diplomat was still alive six days after his official date of death. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely unclear why they are still refusing to release this material,\u201d said Birstein. \u201cWe know these records exist \u2013 so what do they have to hide?\u201d\n\nAfter a formal request by Von Dardel-Dupuy in 2018, Sweden last month belatedly released 40,000 pages of its own Wallenberg archives dating mainly from 1970 to 2018 \u2013 meaning a total of 170,000 pages are now available in Stockholm.\n\nMargot Wallstr\u00f6m, the foreign minister who has since resigned, said at the time that it was \u201cimportant to keep Wallenberg\u2019s memory alive\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cHis civic courage inspires us, and is much needed in today\u2019s world. The government will continue to support the work of trying to get clarity on his destiny.\u201d\n\nBerger said that was not really good enough. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s a gulf between the words and the action. Seventy-five years after Raoul Wallenberg risked his life in Budapest, the question is no longer when the truth will be known, but why neither side seems to have the political will to reveal it.\u201d", "description": "Raoul Wallenberg is thought to have saved as many as 30,000 Jews but his descendants do not know how, when or why he died", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af328be58a9679163e8f59cca242479b9bbc9dc5/0_102_3406_2044/master/3406.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=09cd400514f1a59555d804f043203aba", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
