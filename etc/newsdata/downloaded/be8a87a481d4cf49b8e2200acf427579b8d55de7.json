As the flight got closer, the company were saying they\u2019d be here on Friday, then on Monday. Now, we can\u2019t reach anyone.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gutted for the kids. My oldest doesn\u2019t understand and is asking why we can\u2019t just get new flights. But I\u2019m already \u00a35,000 down and don\u2019t know if or when I\u2019ll be getting it back.\u201d\n\nLast night Dendle said: \u201cThe issue was the aircraft we thought we had a firm contract on was withdrawn. We have spent the last 17 days in trying to find an alternative.\n\n\u201cThe issue was the cost in relation to rates we had agreed. We have been in discussions all day to secure a deal with another airline, we offered them equity in the company if they would supply the aircraft.\n\n\u201cI have been working 18-hour days to try and resolve this issue, but alas it was impossible.\n\n\u201cI apologise for the disruption and disappointment caused, I sincerely feel for the affected clients.\n\n\u201cAll clients\u2019 monies are fully protected and held in a CAA Trust and refunds will take 10 working days.\n\n(Image: DPA/PA Images)\n\nEarlier the CEO had added insult to injury by saying they would refund the ATOL fee of \u00a32.50pp and the SAFI insurance of \u00a32pp which \u201cis non-refundable but in the circumstances we are refunding these as well\u201d.\n\nSussex-based FlyLolo says it specialises in \u201cpeak season only\u201d flights, catering for families who travel in school holidays. They advertise flights to the Canaries from Gatwick, Manchester and Glasgow, offering ATOL protection on all bookings.\n\nA Glasgow Airport spokesman said: \u201cWe would ask all FlyLolo passengers affected not to travel to the airport and to contact the operator direct for further information.\u201d\n\nFlyLoLo can be contacted on 08444 720737.", "description": "Chris McDonald and his family, from Paisley, Scotland, were due to fly from Glasgow to Tenerife this morning", "authors": ["Sally Hind", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Daily Record - Tony Nicoletti", "Daily Record", "Dpa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20557353.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TNP_10-10-19_Flight_05JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
