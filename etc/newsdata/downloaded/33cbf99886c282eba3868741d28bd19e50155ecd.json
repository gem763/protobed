Forbes read the entire book and recommends it, even though he does not agree with all of Schultz\u2019s policy recommendations.\n\nThe post SKOUSEN: Founder of Starbucks Leaves the Democratic Party! appeared first on Stock Investor.", "description": "Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, is a social .09/12/2019 19:34:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Mark Skousen", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
