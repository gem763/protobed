Photograph: aydinmutlu/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nThe fight against plastic waste, often depicted by swathes of rubbish bobbing in the world\u2019s rivers and oceans, hasn\u2019t always been front and centre in people\u2019s minds. At the Museum of Design in Plastics, part of the Arts University Bournemouth, curator Louise Dennis says disposability was once seen as a sign of wealth and cleanliness. \u201cConsumers were encouraged to use disposable products for their efficiency and to avoid contamination,\u201d she says. \u201c[But] plastics are vilified for having a long life when they are in the wrong place. One of plastic\u2019s key features, its lightness, could actually be its downfall. It can be seen floating in water, blowing in the wind and caught in trees as litter.\u201d\n\nPublic opinion about plastic started to shift in the 1970s and 80s, particularly after the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held in Stockholm in 1972, the first to focus on international environmental issues. Interest has since grown significantly \u2013 a recent survey (pdf) found 87% of Europeans are concerned about the impact of plastic waste and almost all (94%) say industry and retailers should try to reduce packaging and design products to ease recycling. In Europe alone, 58m tonnes of plastic are created every year, of which an estimated 15.88m tonnes, or 31kg per person, becomes packaging waste. Only 40% of this is recycled.\n\nIn an effort to boost that percentage, it\u2019s composite materials (where more than one material has been bonded together) that prove to be the most problematic. In practice, separating those materials for further recycling often does not occur. So such packaging is sent to landfill, or burned for energy. But with countries including China, Malaysia and Vietnam banning waste imports, and Thailand set to do the same by 2021, it\u2019s imperative a solution is found for Europe\u2019s rapidly increasing piles of discarded packaging.\n\nMany are working towards achieving an ideal known as the circular economy \u2013 a regenerative model that seeks to minimise resource input and waste by slowing, closing and narrowing material and energy loops. \u201cIt\u2019s not new,\u201d says Dr Pauline Deutz, co-lead of the Plastics Collaboratory at the University of Hull. \u201cOne problem is we don\u2019t know exactly what the end goal is. You can say we want to be circular but there are so many different ways you might [do that]. The principle is that you design things looking ahead (and that doesn\u2019t really happen now so that would be a big, big step) \u2026 but that still leaves many different variables.\u201d\n\nAt Henkel, that\u2019s a challenge Dennis Bankmann is working on. He\u2019s one of the company\u2019s global business developers for the circular economy, focusing on adhesives for packaging and consumer goods: a remit that covers items such as cardboard boxes, bottles for drinks, yoghurt pots and labels, as well as furniture products in the construction industry, nappies, and shoes. It\u2019s a broad range of materials \u2013 paper, plastics, glass, metals and wood \u2013 \u201call of which have or hopefully will soon have their own recycling systems and streams,\u201d says Bankmann, although he admits there are challenges to achieving that goal. \u201cThis is something that no single stakeholder or entity company, or even country, can solve on their own ... you need a broad alignment to make the whole concept work.\u201d\n\nPart of that collaborative thinking has involved working with Saperatec, a German startup that has devised a process to break down the layer structure in composite items without degrading or changing them, including cardboard, plastic and aluminium. Founded by Dr Sebastian Kernbaumin 2011, the company uses a separation liquid to penetrate between multiple layers, before washing, sorting and drying the materials, which are then sold. It\u2019s already been used on products including drinks cartons, lithium-ion batteries, car glass, and packaging material.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Henkel worked with Saperatec to optimise products such as fruit juice pouches for recycling\n\nAs an adhesives manufacturer, Henkel worked with Saperatec to optimise its products for flexible packaging material, particularly items for coffee pouches and fruit juice pouches that include two types of plastics and a thin layer of aluminium foil. This included working together to identify the best adhesive to use for that process. \u201cThis kind of separation can be done very effectively, very completely, very efficiently,\u201d says Bankmann. \u201cIt\u2019s a good example of how you need different stakeholders to work together.\u201d\n\nPlastic recycling: a guide to the myths and realities Read more\n\nHenkel has also been in discussions with recyclers and companies in other sectors who buy recycled materials, and was one of the founding members of CEFLEX, a European consortium that aims to promote circular economy deliverables in flexible packaging. \u201cThis really raises the opportunity,\u201d Bankmann says. \u201cBecause there are so many multinationals here that if we come to a solution we have the opportunity to implement that very widely, geographically \u2026 for us, it\u2019s the clarity and harmonisation that has the biggest impact \u2026 [so we can] start providing solutions.\u201d\n\nMeaningful change has to happen at scale, Deutz agrees, although she believes governments have a role to play in achieving that shift. \u201cYou do need companies to take action, but to have enough companies taking enough action, you need regulation as well.\u201d In May 2019, MEPs called for all plastic packaging waste to be recyclable by 2030, and backed measures to ban the most common single-use plastics (including cotton bud sticks, plastic cutlery and drinking straws).\n\n\u201cI would say overall we are at a beginning,\u201d adds Bankmann. \u201cAnd I believe we will not stop at packaging. In coming to a more sustainable world, we cannot stop at packaging. More and more types of things we produce will come into scope \u2026 essentially every item from our daily life needs to become part of the circular economy.\u201d", "description": "Europe produces 31kg of packaging waste per person every year, but only 40% of that is recycled.
