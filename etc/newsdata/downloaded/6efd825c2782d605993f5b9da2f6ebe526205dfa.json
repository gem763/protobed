Let\u2019s stop fighting over representation and appropriation and start fighting again over quality: \u201cAt present we have a series of \u2018culture wars\u2019 over a wide range of issues \u2014 race, gender, sexuality, power and privilege. But the one culture war we don\u2019t have any more is over culture. Yes, we fight about the ideological messages of literary texts, but not about matters of personal taste. We scrutinise and interrogate works of art for their latent \u2014 or blatant \u2014 sexism and racism. Often what matters is what the work in question says about marginalised groups \u2014 not what it says about us as cultured individuals . . . Who today would dare to suggest that if you prefer Sally Rooney to Iris Murdoch, or Nick Hornby to Philip Roth, there is something wrong with you? That you could be dismissed as a person lacking in seriousness and substance. Answer: no one. But is that really such a good thing?\u201d\n\nIn praise of George Stubbs\u2019s beasts: \u201cThe 18th-century British painter was the \u2018Liverpudlian Leonardo,\u2019 revered for his portraits of racehorses and other creatures.\u201d\n\nEdmund de Waal returns to the homeland: \u201cThe celebrated writer and ceramicist Edmund de Waal has said it is a \u2018huge deal\u2019 for his family, whose Jewish ancestors were driven out of Vienna in 1938, that the Austrian government is to allow descendants of Nazi victims to reclaim their citizenship. De Waal, author of the 2010 bestselling family memoir The Hare with Amber Eyes, said he and his relatives would be returning to Vienna in November for their first reunion in more than eight decades. It would \u2018mean the world\u2019 to his 90-year-old father, Victor de Waal, a former dean of Canterbury cathedral, who came to Britain as a refugee at the age of 10, to reclaim the citizenship that was stolen from his family, he said.\u201d\n\nWilfred McClay explains how The New York Time\u2019s 1619 Project distorts the past: \u201cConsidered strictly as an exercise in historical understanding, and in deepening the public\u2019s understanding of a profound issue in our national past, the Project represents a giant missed opportunity. It passes over the complex truth in favor of an exaggeration bordering on travesty. And if it has any influence, that influence will be as likely as not to damage the nation and distort its self-understanding in truly harmful ways\u2014ways that will perhaps be most harmful of all to Americans of African descent, who do not need to be supplied with yet another reason to feel cut off from the promise of American life.\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nIn The Washington Post, Eli Saslow writes about the disappearing doctors of rural America:\n\n\u201cHe woke up to the sound of an ambulance\u2019s siren, knowing that the ambulance would soon be delivering another patient to him. Ed Garner, 68, changed into medical scrubs and walked out to his truck. He dialed the hospital as he started driving toward the emergency room.\n\n\u201c\u2018Any idea what might be coming?\u2019 he asked, but all anyone knew for certain was that the ambulance was still on its way out to a patient. Sometimes the paramedics were back within minutes, and other trips took nearly two hours. Sometimes they delivered Garner a patient in minor distress, and other times they brought him unresponsive victims of car crashes, heart attacks, drug overdoses or ranching accidents.\n\n\u201c\u2018Do we know anything yet?\u2019 Garner asked again, a few minutes later. A stethoscope dangled from his rearview mirror. He checked his police scanner, but it was quiet. He looked toward the adjacent interstate but saw no obvious wrecks.\n\n\u201cHe lit a cigarette and rolled down the window as he drove by the dusty ranches and dry lakebeds of West Texas. He\u2019d started smoking to cope with the stress of medical school, but now he\u2019d been practicing rural family medicine for 41 years as the stresses continued to mount. He was the only working doctor left to care for three remote counties east of El Paso, an area similar in size to the entire state of Maryland, home to far-flung oil encampments, a desolate stretch of interstate, communities of drifters living off the electric grid, and highway towns made up of truck stops and budget motels. \u2018A wild place of last resort,\u2019 was how Garner described parts of his territory, and for every person in every kind of medical trouble, the true last resort was him.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Vienna\n\nPoem: Lee Oser, \u201cApollo 13\u201d\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
