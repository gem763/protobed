Symptoms can include pain, odour, discharge and itching.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nWhile you might be attached to your earphones, Ms Hellwege suggests that over-ear alternatives are much better for your aural health.\n\nShe added: \u201cLike cotton buds, earphones often pick up the wax in the outer third of the ear canal where it is produced, and can leave the ears dry and itchy.\n\n\u201cLet the wax build back up and see if this improves things. Infections can also be reintroduced by soiled earphones - try cleaning them daily with an alcohol wipe which kills 99.9% of pathogens.\u201d", "description": "An ear expert has revealed that wearing earphones can cause a buildup of dirt, sweat, oil, dead skin and even hair in your ear", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Reuters", "Youtube Jon Collins"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12052466.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_Apple-AirPods-are-displayed-during-a-media-event-in-San-Francisco.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
