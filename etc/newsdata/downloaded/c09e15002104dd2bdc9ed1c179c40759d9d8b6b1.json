She added that \u201cany attempt at demographic change would be unacceptable. The EU will not provide stabilization or development assistance in areas where the rights of local populations are ignored.\u201d\n\nThe Hungarian foreign minister was in Baku accompanying Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to the Turkic Council. On Monday, Orb\u00e1n held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\nThe Turkish leader \"expressed his gratitude for the fact that Hungary stands up for Turkey on the international scene,\" a spokesperson for Orb\u00e1n said after the meeting.\n\nThe Turkish leader is scheduled to visit Budapest on November 7.", "description": "P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 says the most important thing is to protect Hungarian interests and stop migration.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer", "Joshua Posaner", "Jacopo Barigazzi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1126755658-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
