Former NBA star Shaquille O\u2019Neal defended Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s right to tweet his support of Hong Kong, which angered the Chinese government and has caused a rift between the NBA and China.\n\n\u201cOne of our best values here in America is free speech. We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say and we are allowed to speak out on injustices and that\u2019s just how it goes,\u201d O\u2019Neal said on Tuesday. \u201cIf people don\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s something they have to deal with.\u201d\n\nSince Morey tweeted his support of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in early October, which enraged the Chinese government, the ensuing fallout has dominated national news headlines. On Thursday, TNT will air the Rockets\u2019 first game of the season against the Milwaukee Bucks and will have NBA commissioner Adam Silver on its pregame show.\n\nAlso Read: ESPN, Turner Hope for NBA Ratings Resurgence Amid Wide-Open Chase for Title\n\nChina\u2019s state-run CCTV did not air Tuesday night\u2019s games, though they were available for streaming in the country on Tencent, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was unfortunate for both parties, and then you got people speaking when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. But Daryl Morey was right,\u201d O\u2019Neal continued. \u201cWhenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say \u2018That\u2019s not right,\u2019 and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nMorey\u2019s support of Hong Kong, where he wrote in a since-deleted tweet: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong\u201d \u2014 was immediately criticized by the Chinese government. The Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) suspended all cooperation with the Rockets, which is among the most popular teams in China. The Chinese Media Group, the country\u2019s state-controlled media arm, said it was \u201cdeeply shocked by the erroneous comments\u201d made by Morey. Tencent Sports, which signed a five-year, $1.5 billion contract to continue as the NBA\u2019s streaming partner in China, no longer offers live-streams of Rockets games and has suspended all news coverage of the team.\n\nAlso Read: Pro-Hong Kong and Free Tibet Activists Protest During Preseason Nets-Raptors NBA Game\n\nThe Rockets are more closely tied to China. Yao Ming, who played his entire career with the Rockets, is currently the head of the CBA.\n\nLast week, at the Time 100 Health Summit in New York, Silver said that China had asked the NBA to fire Morey over the tweet. He said there was \u201cno chance that\u2019s happening,\u201d adding further that they wouldn\u2019t even discipline him for the tweet. According to the South China Morning Post, in a commentary, China\u2019s state-run TV station CCTV said Silver could face \u201cretribution\u201d for defaming China and supporting Morey.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong, which began in March before growing to its current scale in June, came as a result of a proposed extradition law. This bill would allow criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial. Activists argue the bill would threaten legal rights that Hong Kong residents have under the current \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework.\n\nRead original story Shaquille O\u2019Neal Says Daryl Morey \u2018Was Right\u2019 to Speak Out on China At TheWrap", "description": "\u201cInside the NBA\u201d did not shy away from discussing the ongoing crisis between the NBA and China during TNT\u2019s pregame coverage of the first night of the NBA season on Tuesday.
