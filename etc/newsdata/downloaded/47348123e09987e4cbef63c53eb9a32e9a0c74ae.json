But at the same time, he\u2019s an incredibly talented actor and filmmaker and has a super impressive resume. So I think we all had absolutely no idea what to expect when it came to his latest film, Honey Boy.\n\nThe film is titled Honey Boy, after the nickname given to the now 33-year-old Even Stevens star by his problematic, heroin-addicted father.\n\nHoney Boy is a slightly fictionalised version of LaBeouf\u2019s troubled childhood including being thrown into the spotlight at a young age, and dealing with a heroin addict father. LaBeouf plays his dad in the film under the name James Lort, while the fictionalised version of himself is played by Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) and Lucas Hedges (Lady Bird).\n\nThe film follows the highs and lows of James Lort\u2019s battle with addiction, presenting the \u201cgood and the bad without judgement\u201d, Slant Magazine reports.\n\nHoney Boy also received four \u2018V\u2019s from Vox, who called it \u201can exercise in extreme empathy, and a must-see.\u201d\n\nConsidering how erratic and unpredictable Shia LaBeouf is in real life, nobody really knew what to expect from a film he basically did everything for. But I\u2019ll let the first reactions on Twitter speak for themselves, because the professional critics fucking LOVED it.\n\nHONEY BOY feels cathartic but then also inviting \u2013 an introspective and painful memoir that equally manages to be playful and so pretty. All three young men are very sad and talented and I enjoyed it a lot #TIFF19 \u2014 Ella Kemp (@ella_kemp) September 5, 2019\n\nHONEY BOY: I had high expectations for Shia LaBeouf's performance and he exceeded all of them. A brutal, wounding, and intimate movie that's unlike any biopic you've ever seen. #TIFF19 \u2014 Anne Cohen (@anneesthercohen) September 5, 2019\n\nGot to see #HoneyBoy today. It\u2019s intense and raw, and I absolutely loved the performances by Noah Jupe, Shia LeBeouf, and Lucas Hesges. Definitely check this out when it hits hot heaters. #TIFF \u2014 Wendy Lee Szany (@WendyLeeSzany) September 5, 2019\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m just stoked that people are starting to appreciate Shia LaBeouf for the artist he really is. All jokes and \u201cdo it\u201d memes aside, Shia LaBeouf is a wildly talented actor, writer and filmmaker.\n\nDespite not really making headlines for anything other than his wild antics, LaBeouf has actually got a pretty impressive resume. His works include films like Borg vs McEnroe, American Honey and The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman in addition to the obvious faves like Holes and Even Stevens.\n\nFor all of us whose Toronto Film Fest invites got lost in the mail, Honey Boy is officially released in the US on November 8 via Amazon Studios. Hopefully Australia won\u2019t be far behind.\n\nBut until then you can watch the trailer on repeat and maybe cry like I did because Shia LaBeouf is a treasure and I just want the best for him.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/honeyboy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
