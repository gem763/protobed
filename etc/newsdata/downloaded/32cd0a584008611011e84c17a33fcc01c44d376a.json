This is a fact about the American founding that has been suppressed for too long. Certainly all the firearms that sprout Hydra-like across the country were acquired by no mortal means, and it is important for us to describe exactly how they came about, so that we may better understand and appreciate them.\n\nThe year is not important. But it was a long time ago, at least 230 years.\n\nThe country possessed many wonders. There were waterfalls, rocks, rills, woods, templed hills. There were raccoons, small nervous bears that were forever washing their hands like tiny Ladys Macbeth. There were armadillos. There was even syphilis and Christianity, both thoughtful gifts from Europe. But when one surveyed the country from above, something seemed to be missing. What was it?\n\nSuddenly, thunder rumbled. In the hall in Philadelphia where they were gathered to write a Constitution, and also in Virginia where George Mason was crafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights (confusingly, these events were in different years, but theologians assure me this is possible), the delegates shuddered, and Benjamin Franklin had to rub James Madison\u2019s back soothingly and murmur to him so his hands stopped shaking enough to be able to start taking notes again.\n\n\u201cBEHOLD,\u201d said a thundering voice from a cloud. (Madison had resumed taking his notes at this point, which is how we know this.) The heavens parted. An enormous hand stretched forth, holding a mysterious black object, long and pointed like a stick.\n\n\u201cI\u2019M GIVING YOU THIS,\u201d the hand said. \u201cA GIFT, FROM ME TO YOU, THAT NO ONE CAN EVER TAKE AWAY.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the delegates asked.\n\n\u201cJUST TAKE IT,\u201d the hand said. \u201cDON\u2019T WORRY ABOUT IT.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it for?\u201d the delegates asked.\n\n\u201cKILLING,\u201d the hand said. \u201cINDISCRIMINATELY. CHILDREN, TEENAGERS, GRANDMOTHERS, PARENTS ON THEIR WAY TO PICK UP THEIR KIDS FROM SCHOOL. TODDLERS. I GUESS YOU COULD USE IT FOR HUNTING, BUT NOT IF YOU WERE PARTICULARLY GOOD AT HUNTING.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a musket?\u201d someone asked.\n\nThe voice laughed long and loud and rumblingly. \u201cONLY IN THE LOOSEST SENSE,\u201d the voice said. \u201cFOR BEHOLD, THIS CAN FIRE 600 ROUNDS PER MINUTE.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis seems like it could be useful in a war,\u201d Mason said, not unreasonably.\n\n\u201cI DON\u2019T MEAN IN WAR,\u201d the voice said. \u201cTHAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING. I MEAN, IN PRIVATE HOMES AND ON CITY STREETS AND UNLOCKED IN CABINETS IN HOUSES WITH TODDLERS IN THEM, AND IN THE HANDS OF POLICE OFFICERS.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d the delegates said. \u201cUh, well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU HAVE THIS,\u201d the voice said.\n\n\u201cIs this for the well-regulated militia?\u201d someone asked.\n\n\u201cNOT REALLY,\u201d the voice said. \u201cDON\u2019T GET DISTRACTED. IF ANYONE TRIES TO RESTRICT IT TO THAT, SAY NO. SAY I GAVE YOU THESE. SAY THEY\u2019RE FROM ME AND THEY\u2019D BETTER NOT TRY TO TAKE THEM.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a slight question,\u201d Benjamin Franklin said.\n\n\u201cSTOP ASKING QUESTIONS,\u201d the voice said. \u201cAND IF ANYONE EVER SAYS, \u2018THERE ARE TOO MANY, THESE ARE TOO DANGEROUS, WE DON\u2019T WANT THEM ANY MORE, THE MILITIA THING HAS REALLY WANED SO IT SEEMS LIKE MOSTLY THEY ARE USED TO CAUSE ACCIDENTS IN THE HOME, TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO END THEIR LIVES WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO, AND TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND CIVILIANS,\u2019 YOU MUST SAY NO, BECAUSE I TOLD YOU SO AND I AM PLEASED TO BEHOLD THIS GREAT WORK.\u201d\n\nThe clouds began to close. These objects began to rain from the sky in a great profusion. Large and small, shiny and dull. They fell onto the table until you could not see the Constitution underneath them.\n\nThe voice receded in a great rumbling.\n\n\u201cWait! Do you think the electoral college is a good system?\u201d Madison yelled after it. But there was no answer.\n\nThe objects lay there in a pile on the green felt-covered table. Nobody would touch them for a long time.\n\n\u201cHow do we,\" one of the delegates started, then stopped. \u201cUh, how do we indicate all of that, in the Constitution?\"\n\nMadison sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s just put in the militia thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of that may well happen, but I am not certain we should give it a head start.\u201d\n\nFranklin sighed. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m a deist.\u201d\n\nThat is as far as the notes go on the day when God gave us all this God-given right.\n\nRead more from Alexandra Petri:\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with good, harmless fun!\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s record player and his hot-air balloon of memory\n\nPlease enjoy Facebook Dating!", "description": "This is how it happened, approximately.", "authors": ["Alexandra Petri", "Columnist Offering A Lighter Take On The News", "Opinions Of The Day", "Alexandra Petri Is A Washington Post Columnist Offering A Lighter Take On The News", "Opinions Of The Day.
