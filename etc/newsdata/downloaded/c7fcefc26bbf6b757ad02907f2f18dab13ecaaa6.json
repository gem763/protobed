Prankster prepares hilarious Halloween costume based on WAG's feud", "language": "en", "text": "A prankster has prepared a hilarious Halloween costume based on the social media feud between Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.\n\nWith Halloween just round the corner, one Twitter user had the bright idea to put together an ensemble perfectly capturing the explosive row between the WAGs.\n\nEarlier this month Coleen, 33, accused Rebekah of leaking stories about her to the media, and revealed how she set up an elaborate Instagram 'sting' to catch the suspected culprit out.\n\nFans dubbed the mother-of-four 'Wagatha Christie' after her online sleuthing skills, and she concluded her lengthy social media post with: 'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nIt served as the perfect inspiration for Kieran, who is pictured on Twitter wearing a large cardboard cut out of what looks like an Instagram account, with a solitary viewer, Rebekah Vardy.\n\nTwitter user Kieran posted his innovative Halloween costume online and people thought it was 'amazing'\n\nA social media user called Lewis said: 'ding ding we have a winner' followed by laughing emojis\n\nAnother user posted a gif which said 'Iconic' after witnessing the innovative Halloween costume\n\nAnd Beard of the Match said this Halloween costume was the winner for 2019, and posted a gif of Leonardo di Caprio\n\nRachel A wondered when the Wagatha Christie costume was going to surface this year\n\nHe captioned it: 'it's.......Rebekah Vardy's account #Halloween2019.\n\nIn a follow up tweet he then cheekily copied in Coleen Rooney's Twitter handle with two emojis of a person blowing kisses, and a heart.\n\nNeedless to say, social media users found the innovative costume hilarious.\n\nBeard of the Match said: 'Halloween costume winner of 2019 goes to...you sir,' which he accompanied by a gif of Leonardo Di Caprio holding a trophy.\n\nIn the lengthy post about her detective skills on her own Instagram account, Coleen wrote: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these shock claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her and she concluded that it was Rebekah Vardy's account\n\n'After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion. To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while).\n\nRebekah Vardy stands behind Coleen Rooney at the Stade Bollaert-delelis For The England Vs. Wales Group B Match In Lens France\n\n'Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n'It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\nRebekah, who was on holiday with Jamie in Dubai at the time, hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations.\n\nShe wrote: 'Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even having to write this. I\u2019m pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation - she also slammed her for going public when she is heavily pregnant\n\n'I\u2019m now having to take legal advice as I can\u2019t deal with this stress myself when I\u2019m this pregnant.'\n\nShe also shared: 'As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\n'I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\n'If you thought this was happening you can could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.'", "description": "With Halloween just round the corner, one Twitter user had the bright idea to put together an ensemble perfectly capturing the explosive row between Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/18/20290866-0-image-a-2_1572287586025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
