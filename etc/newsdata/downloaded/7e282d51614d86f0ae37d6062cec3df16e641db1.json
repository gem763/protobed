I love the idea of appearing on a card in Australia myself and hope that one day I can fight down under.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a lot of friends who live in Sydney and have spent some time over there myself, so I would jump at the opportunity to compete in front of an Aussie crowd.\n\nWood\u2019s Fight to Watch\n\nWood is keeping one eye on rival bantamweight Taha (Picture: Getty)\n\nI will also be keeping an eye on the bantamweight bout between Khalid Taha and Bruno Silva this weekend as both men offer something a bit different to the division.\n\nHowever, I can only see one winner here and think Taha will continue his UFC winning streak. Taha is one of several European athletes on this card, including Swedish fighter Rostem Akman, and I felt that the Scandinavian fighters were outstanding last week in Copenhagen.\n\nThey have some amazing athletes and it would be great to see more exciting Scandinavian fighters competing on the biggest platform in MMA.\n\nMORE: Michael Venom Page: Derek Chisora should wait for Joseph Parker", "description": "I am really looking forward to the action this weekend, as UFC returns to Australia for the second time this year.
