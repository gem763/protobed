Chu responded to the news of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d co-writer Adele Lim\u2019s departure from the franchise after it was revealed Lim left the project due to a substantial pay disparity between the Malaysia-born screenwriter and white co-writer Peter Chiarelli.\n\nChu, who shared a written statement on Twitter, wrote that \u201cyou bet your ass I stand with Adele!\u201d\n\nFor those of you who are asking... pic.twitter.com/1SoFLrUBbF \u2014 Jon M. Chu (@jonmchu) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cI believed in her before we ever shot the movie and believe in her beyond,\u201d Chu wrote. \u201cAs many of you can imagine, negotiations are tough and more often than not mess \u2015 no matter who you are in this industry.\u201d\n\nBeing close with Lim, the director explained that when he learned she was not pleased with the initial pay offer, he, the producers, and some studio executives \u201cleapt into action to ensure we got to a place of parity between the two writers at a significant number.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported last week that for the hit film\u2019s sequels, Lim received a starting offer of $110,000-plus from Warner Bros. while Chiarelli\u2019s ranged from $800,000 to $1 million.\n\nThe studio reportedly rationalized the disparity, given that the industry has traditionally set ranges based on experience. Lim\u2019s first screenwriting credit was the 2018 rom-com hit. Chiarelli\u2019s credits include 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Proposal\u201d and 2016\u2019s \u201cNow You See Me 2.\u201d\n\nChu added that by the time the group had come up with \u201cseveral different ways to satisfy everyone\u2019s needs, a lot of time had passed and she declined the offer.\u201d\n\nAlberto E.

Pictures' \"Crazy Rich Asiaans\" at TCL Chinese Theatre IMAX on August 7, 2018 in Hollywood, California.\n\n\u201cThese things happen in negotiations, and I\u2019m proud that she was able to stand up for her own measure of worth and walk away when she felt like she was being undervalued,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile the director said he agreed with Lim in that pay parity is necessary for the \u201ccontinued enlightenment\u201d of the industry and Hollywood still needs work in the aspect, he said what he\u2019s \u201cdiscovered personally through this process is there are still things to debate amongst ourselves (like the value of experience vs lack of opportunity, tv vs film writing, work experience vs life experience, creative contribution valuations etc) which I am sure won\u2019t be simple answers but I know we must try to figure it out to keep the needle moving.\u201d\n\nLim expressed her appreciation for Chu and others involved in the culturally impactful movie on Twitter. Others from the cast, including Gemma Chan and Awkwafina, tweeted their support of both Lim and Chu.\n\nIt\u2019s been a week. My gratitude to the countless people who voiced their support. To people going through their own fight - you are not alone. Also, I have only love for @jonmchu and the cast & crew of #CRA. It was/is a movement and I\u2019ll always root for its continued success \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Adele Lim (@adeleBlim) September 8, 2019\n\nI too stand with @adeleBlim and fully support her, as I do every person fighting for pay equity. Pay disparity disproportionately affects women and POC and there is still a long way to go - both in the conversation and how to rectify it. We can and must do better, faster. https://t.co/GQtgIFHL9U \u2014 Gemma Chan (@gemma_chan) September 10, 2019\n\nI stand and will continue to stand with @adeleBlim - thank you for this and for shedding more light on a conversation that should be had @jonmchu https://t.co/27SlU10Fag \u2014 AWKWAFINA (@awkwafina) September 10, 2019\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s account of events, the studio refused to deviate from the old-school standard of setting pay ranges based on experience, a decision backed by chairman Toby Emmerich. Although Chiarelli offered to split his fee, prompting the studio to approach Lim with a more equal bid, Lim stood firm on her decision.\n\n\u201cPete has been nothing but incredibly gracious, but what I make shouldn\u2019t be dependent on the generosity of the white-guy writer,\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter.", "description": "Jon M.
