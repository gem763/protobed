Then I can really enjoy the off-season, or whatever off-season we have, December, January, and reset and go again.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy conceded he needed to \u201cdrag myself off the sofa\u201d after taking a two-week rest heading into the European Tour\u2018s flagship event this week.\n\nMcIlroy revealed: \u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s been quite tough. I\u2019m not used to playing this much golf in a short period of time. You used to play a couple weeks on, take a couple weeks off, play another couple weeks.\n\n\u201cI think I played 13 tournaments in a 16-week stretch. It\u2019s a lot of golf and it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to get used to. It\u2019s the new schedule, especially throw in the Olympics next year and the Ryder Cup and everything else.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I needed those two weeks on the sofa, just to sort of reset and get myself in the right place mentally to get motivated to go again for this last little bit of the year.\u201d", "description": "Rory McIlroy\u00a0is looking to close 2019 in style by adding two more wins to match his career-best total for a calendar year (5) \u2013 starting with the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth this week.\u00a0 The Irishman has already won three times this year: The Players Championship, Canadian Open and Tour Championship \u2013 which helped him clinch the PGA Tour\u2019s Player of the Year award ahead", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/15/McIlroy-enjoyed-a-superb-2019-on-the-PGA-Tour.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
