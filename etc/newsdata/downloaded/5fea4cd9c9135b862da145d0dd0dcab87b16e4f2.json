His critics were certain of it\u2014he had colluded with Russian interference in the 2016 election, or at least he the act of covering it up appeared impeachable. They thought that once Robert Mueller released his report, Trump would be finished.\n\nAnd then Mueller delivered the report\u2014without a recommendation to impeach. For weeks, anti-Trump commentators tried to interpret and spin the report in such a way to keep the possibility of impeachment alive. When that failed, they pinned their hopes on the prosecutors of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Now they were sure to have the goods\u2014they would indict Trump for his payoffs to mistresses like Stormy Daniels. That was a violation of campaign-finance laws, somehow, wasn\u2019t it?\n\nBut no, it wasn\u2019t. The court did not charge Trump with anything: not with sex-related payoffs as esoteric campaign-finance violations, not with any financial crimes of any kind. Nothing.\n\nEven before Mueller and his great dud of a report, there was the Emoluments Clause. Remember that one? Trump was going down because foreign dignitaries liked to stay at his hotels, and that amounted to the sort of emoluments forbidden by the Constitution. Impeachable offense!\n\nThat one was a dud too. Then there was the woman who claimed that in a changing room in Bergdorf Goodman one day in the 1980s, Trump . . . Well, her story didn\u2019t do the trick either, though it created a predictable media sensation for about a week.\n\nThe snap reaction of supposedly serious media figures and political analysts to each of these episodes, and a few others besides, has been premature and badly premised. They lept to conclusions out of Trump-hating zeal. And now they\u2019re doing it again, this time over the assumption that the Trump acted improperly in talking to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky about the curious business dealings Joe Biden\u2019s son had in the country. This time, Nancy Pelosi, under intense pressure from her party\u2019s most furious activists, has said she\u2019ll open an impeachment inquiry.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "What this scandal boils down to is Trump\u2019s willingness to use all legal means at his disposal to strike at business-as-usual among the political elite, or at least the Democratic side of the political elite.", "authors": ["Daniel Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MJ1hQ2duWCV5eJH0LeyO1Q--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/a72d8d6bd1cb60997ab0c12d7e0c01aa", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
