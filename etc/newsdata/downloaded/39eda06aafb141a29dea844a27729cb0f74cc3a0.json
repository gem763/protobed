The Pentagon has not yet commented.\n\nThe shelling occurred on Mashtenour hill in Kobani, a border city under Kurdish control. Turkish forces are moving in on the region to reclaim it from the YPG, a group of Kurdish fighters.\n\nTurkish forces allege that YPG fighters are planning to launch attacks over the border from the area.\n\nThe president, when asked about the shelling on the White House lawn on Friday afternoon, said: 'We'll take a look at it.'\n\nMembers of the Turkish-backed Syrian Free Army enter Syria's Rasulayn clear the town on Friday. Turkey is gradually making its advance on the Kurdish-controlled portion of Northern Syria where it says it wants to create a 'corridor of peace'\n\nKobani is a border city in the area of northern Syria being controlled by Kurds. Turkey is moving in to take control of it. The US Special Forces Unit was stationed on Mashtenour hill\n\nIt wants to move in and create a 'safe zone', wiping out the Kurds and any ISIS prisoners being kept there.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump agreed to remove US Special Operation Units which have been in the region for years, bolstering the Kurds in their fight against ISIS, and the Syrian Army.\n\nNewsweek cited anonymous Department of Defense officials who said it was unlikely that the Turkish army would mistake US troops for Kurds in that case and that they would be aware of US positions 'down to the grid.'\n\nBoth a senior Pentagon official and a Iraqi Kurdish intelligence official confirmed the shelling.\n\nCNN reported that there was no indication the shelling was deliberate.\n\n'Turkish artillery hit close to a US special operations unit near Kobani on Friday, US official confirms.\n\n'The artillery shells hit several hundred meters from where the US special ops forces were located. There are no US injuries,' one of its reporters tweeted.\n\nThey know we are there, we told them our position. There\u2019s no other target in the area. They\u2019re trying to drive us out. If Turkey can get us to leave so they can siege Kobane, it\u2019s all over Coalition officer after 'accidental' artillery bombardment on Friday\n\nTurkey's military also issued a statement insisting it was an accident and that it was returning fire on the Kurds.\n\nIt said that as soon as it realized US Special Forces had potentially been caught in the middle, it ceased.\n\nHowever journalists in the region cite other officials who say it is impossible it was a mistake.\n\n'They know we are there, we told them our position. There\u2019s no other target in the area. They\u2019re trying to drive us out. If Turkey can get us to leave so they can siege Kobane, it\u2019s all over,' one Coalition officer told Telegraph reporter Josie Ensor.\n\nThe unnamed official said the shelling was so heavy, US forces considered returning fire.\n\nThe Pentagon has not yet responded to DailyMail.com's inquiries.\n\nIt comes after President Trump agreed to remove US troops from the region, where they have been bolstering the Kurds since the start of the Syrian civil war.\n\nA US military convoy is pictured in a joint patrol with Turkish troops in al-Hashisha on the outskirts of Tal Abyad in September. The US is slowly removing troops from the region\n\nTurkey is fighting them, claiming they are a terrorist organization.\n\nTrump has been criticized for the decision, with some fearing it could enable ISIS fighters in the region by removing one of the key groups fighting them, and expose the Kurds to harm.\n\nHe has insisted he will impose sanctions on Turkey if it acts irresponsibly.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin also fired a warning shot at Turkey on Friday, saying Trump is prepared to impose 'very significant' sanctions on Ankara if President Recep Tayyip Erdogan steps out of line.\n\nMnuchin said that Trump had signed an executive order giving Treasury the authority, in consultation with the State Department, to impose sanctions a moment's notice. He declined to elaborate on potential targets but said financial institutions had been put on notice.\n\nTurkey has also been told 'not allow even a single ISIS fighter to escape' from captivity, he announced from the White House podium at a short-notice briefing.\n\nDespite the warning, he said Erdogan's invitation to visit the White House on November 13 remained intact.\n\nThe White House announcement was intended to mollify Republican lawmakers threatening to revolt over the president's decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria, in what they decried as an abandonment of Kurdish allies who helped defeat ISIS, and turn over control of imprisoned terrorists to Erdogan's army.\n\nSens. Lindsey Graham and Chris Van Hollen have vowed to sanction Turkey over the incursion.\n\nMnuchin told DailyMail.com the president has it handled, and Congress should stand down.\n\n'Secretary Pompeo has been speaking to them daily. I\u2019ve been speaking to the Secretary multiple times a day. I think the message to Congress is -- I know that people were contemplating sanctions. We\u2019re on top of sanctions. The President will use them when necessary.'", "description": "The shelling occurred  on\u00a0Mashtenour hill in Kobani, a border city under Kurdish control.\u00a0Turkish forces are moving in on the region to reclaim it from the YPG, a group of Kurdish fighters.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com", "Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailydailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19607656-0-image-a-87_1570828031837.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
