Yes, there\u2019s such a thing", "language": "en", "text": "The bottle: Clarendelle Red 2015, $17.99\n\nThe back story: If you\u2019re a fan of French wine, you should be preparing to pay more to enjoy a sip or two. New tariffs are set to go into effect that will raise the price by 25% on a host of European goods, including Scotch whisky, Italian cheese and, yes, French wine.\n\nBut there\u2019s an alternative of sorts. Namely, look for more affordable French wine.\n\nWhich brings us to Clarendelle, a label that is connected to the prestigious Bordeaux estate Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion. (Both are owned by Domaine Clarence Dillon, a family company.) But unlike Haut-Brion, Clarendelle is not part of the classification system that distinguishes the more rarefied (and by extension, more expensive) wines from France\u2019s prized Bordeaux region. Instead, Clarendelle simply bills itself as a \u201cpremium\u201d brand, but one aimed for the everyday drinker.\n\nTo quote Prince Robert of Luxembourg, the chair of Domaine Clarence Dillon, \u201cWhen I was a young man living in London, I didn\u2019t have a cellar and I wanted good wine, ready for drinking straightaway, at an affordable price\u2026That\u2019s how I imagined Clarendelle.\u201d\n\nThe concept is apparently catching on, at least in America: When Clarendelle was launched in the U.S. in 2006, it was carried in just five states, according to label representatives. Now, it\u2019s distributed in 20.\n\nWhat we think about it: This is simply a wonderful wine (and an incredible value at its current price under $20). More than anything, it\u2019s a straightforward and well-balanced sip made to be enjoyed with a hearty meal. The label points to its ripe red fruit flavors \u2014 we get a nice taste of cherries \u2014 and hints of spice and licorice.\n\nHow to enjoy it: Try this with any meat dishes: veal, pork, beef, lamb, you name it. But we also paired it with a plate of pasta in red sauce.", "description": "A wine to counter those looming European tariffs.", "authors": ["Charles Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS655_claren_ZG_20191004091452.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
