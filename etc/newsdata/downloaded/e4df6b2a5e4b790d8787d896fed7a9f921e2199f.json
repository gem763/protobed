They are pictured together outside Regents Park Mosque in July 2013\n\nIt is believed his wife was killed at around the same time.\n\nHaque, 39, was a devout follower of hate preacher Choudary since at least 2011. He was pictured acting as a bodyguard for him at demonstrations in London.\n\nHaque (centre) and fellow extremists chanted \u2018burn British soldiers, burn in hell\u2019 as crowds observed a two-minute silence nearby. Haque was charged with a public order offence following the incident \u2013 but was cleared due to lack of evidence\n\nHe is also said to have had links to Khuram Butt, ringleader of the London Bridge terror attack in 2017.\n\nBefore travelling to Syria, Haque was seen at several Islamist rallies, and in 2010 was filmed burning large plastic poppies near the Royal Albert Hall on Remembrance Sunday.\n\nHaque and fellow extremists chanted \u2018burn British soldiers, burn in hell\u2019 as crowds observed a two-minute silence nearby.\n\nHaque was charged with a public order offence following the incident \u2013 but was cleared due to lack of evidence.\n\nOriginally from Bethnal Green, east London, Haque reached Syria despite being on the radar of MI5 and anti-terrorist police.\n\nHe is then believed to have encouraged others to follow his lead and leave Britain to join IS.\n\nMohammed Reza Haque, known as the Jihadi Giant due to his 6ft 6in frame, fled the UK in 2014 and survived until the final days of the so-called IS \u2018caliphate\u2019\n\nIn January 2016, he was identified as one of five masked jihadis in an IS propaganda film. The men executed five alleged spies by shooting them in the back of the head in a Syrian desert.\n\nHaque resurfaced again in December 2016 when another IS film showed him beheading a terrified captive.\n\nThe footage led to him being described as the \u2018new Jihadi John\u2019 due to his similarity to the murderer, also from London, who beheaded five Western hostages.\n\nJihadi John (real name Mohammed Emwazi) was responsible for the deaths of two Britons \u2013 David Haines, 44, and Alan Henning, 47 \u2013 as well as three Americans. He was killed by a US drone strike on Raqqa in November 2015.\n\nExperts believe Haque subsequently took over from Emwazi as one of IS\u2019s chief executioners.\n\nIn the December film, he appeared with four other jihadis and five kneeling men who had been accused of spying.\n\nOne of the unidentified jihadis said in Arabic: \u2018They thought they were safe, but God shamed them, and they will be slaughtered by the knife which will slaughter those like them.\u2019\n\nHaque resurfaced again in December 2016 when another IS film showed him beheading a terrified captive\n\nHaque and the others in the video then grabbed each victim by the hair and beheaded them.\n\nSecurity experts have warned that his old friend Choudary continues to inspire a network of extremists.\n\nThey fear he poses a renewed terror threat a year after his early release from jail.\n\nThe \u2018unrepentant\u2019 father of five is now back at his home in east London \u2013 the site from which he previously led an extremist network which helped to radicalise a string of terrorists, including Lee Rigby\u2019s killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.\n\nChoudary was freed last October after serving under half of his five-and-a-half year sentence for inviting support for IS.", "description": "Mohammed Reza Haque, known as the Jihadi Giant due to his 6ft 6in frame, fled the UK in 2014 and survived until the final days of the so-called IS 'caliphate' before he was killed in Syria.", "authors": ["Larisa Brown", "Josh White For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20197884-0-image-a-23_1572036313304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
