(Photo: Lars Niki / Stringer, Getty Images)\n\nWe love trailers here at Gizmodo \u2014 there are few things about movies better than, well, y\u2019know, good entire movies. An artful teaser can inspire intrigue (and a desire to break its secrets down), dazzle the eyes, or evoke powerful tone without saying much in the way of actual information at all. But a new survey says that less is more rather literally.\n\nPublished by The Hollywood Reporter and Morning Consult, the survey \u2014 from a sample size of just 2,200 people in the U.S., so don\u2019t declare it entirely definitive, at least \u2014 found that 59 per cent of respondents preferred seeing only one to three trailers before a movie.\n\nConsidering a typical theatre chain can have a 20 minute pre-show containing 5 to 8 trailers on average \u2014 something only about 29 per cent of the surveyed respondents wanted to see \u2014 that seems like it could be bad news, especially if, like us, you actually don\u2019t mind trailers being part of the experience.\n\nEven as someone who, by both the nature of my job and as someone who likes keeping up with movie news, watches a lot of trailers as they break online \u2014 long before I\u2019ll ever actually see them in a movie theatre \u2014 there\u2019s still something magical about seeing a good movie trailer in a theatre.\n\nEmphasis on the good there: bland over-explanations of a film\u2019s premise that often just run through all the plot beats or cover all the good gags and what have you, are just overlong adverts, and between the actual ads in a theatre pre-show, there\u2019s already enough of that going on.\n\nBut seeing an artfully done teaser \u2014 snappy, creative, mysterious, jam packed with promise and intrigue \u2014 and letting it, well, tease you in that atmosphere is an electrical feeling. I can still remember seeing that final The Force Awakens trailer in a jam-packed theatre. I\u2019d seen it dozens of time already online.\n\nHell, I helped break the damn thing down with enough gifs to power a fully armed and operational battlestation. I could mouth along with the dialogue, whistle away at that triumphantly brassy take on John Williams\u2019 Force leitmotif.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t new to me, and yet, in that environment, surrounded by people who gasped and ooh\u2019d and aah\u2019d at it, seeing it again was like seeing it for the first time. I\u2019d take plenty of trailers like those over the drab, dime-a-dozen over-explainers in a pre-show any time. Cutting it down to just three at most seems like a good way to risk getting more of those general, \u201cgotta hit all demographic\u201d style trailers instead of the mysterious, speculation-inviting ones.\n\nThe survey did have a few silver linings for both cinema owners and trailer lovers: apparently the displeasure for more trailers before a movie is something that increases as you get older.\n\nAlthough they still in general were receptive to seeing just one to three trailers in a pre-show, Generation Z and Millenials \u2014 who make up the bulk of moviegoers and are probably also the most likely people to see trailers online and on social media before they do within the confines of a theatre seat \u2014 30 per cent of those polled in the 18-22 and 23-38 age brackets were fine with seeing around four to six trailers as part of a pre-show, that sweet spot in the current average.\n\nYou can check out the full data from the survey here.", "description": "We love trailers here at Gizmodo \u2014 there are few things about movies better than, well, y\u2019know, good entire movies.
