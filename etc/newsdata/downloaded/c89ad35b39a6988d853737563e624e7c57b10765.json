Over 900 people perished that day, more than a third of them children. As he lay dying of a bullet wound to the head\u2014a less painful way to go than cyanide and one that he probably orchestrated\u2014Jones told his followers that it was \u201call the media\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t believe them.\u201d\n\nThose words, uttered so long ago, sound disturbingly familiar as we approach the 41st anniversary of Jonestown. We have a president who regularly disparages and blames the media, calling it \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d and \u201cphony,\u201d and who calls journalists \u201cenemies of the people\u201d\u2014epithets that seem especially frenzied in the wake of the whistleblower complaint and the launching of the House impeachment inquiry. It might seem an outrageous proposition to compare Donald Trump to a murderous cult leader. And yet there are alarming parallels. Like Jones and other cult leaders, Trump exhibits features of what psychologist Eric Erickson called \u201cmalignant narcissism\u201d\u2014bombastic grandiosity, a bottomless need for praise, lack of empathy, pathological lying, apparent sadism, and paranoia. In short, he fits the stereotypical psychological profile of a cult leader.\n\nI have seen that profile up close. Over 40 years ago, while a junior in college, I was recruited into a destructive mind control cult, the Unification Church, popularly known as the Moonies after its leader, Sun Myung Moon. I rose rapidly through the ranks and was invited to attend meetings with Moon and his top aides, where we knelt and bowed to our leader Moon. Two years later, after three days straight of leading a fundraising team\u2014selling flowers on street corners\u2014I fell asleep at the wheel and woke up as I plowed into the back of an 18 wheeler. Fortunately, I survived. My family hired deprogrammers and, after five days, I realized I had been brainwashed.\n\nSince then, I have devoted myself to studying mind control cults and helping families rescue loved ones from their clutches. I have learned that mind control is not a vague, mystical process but, instead, is the result of a concrete and specific and systematic set of methods and techniques. Cult leaders may seem crazy, but they are cunning masters of manipulation, employing an arsenal of these techniques to render their followers dependent and obedient. It\u2019s what I call the cult leader\u2019s playbook.\n\nAs I argue in my upcoming book, The Cult of Trump: A Leading Cult Expert Explains How The President Uses Mind Control (Simon & Schuster), Trump has gotten where he is today in large part because he has exploited tactics straight out of that playbook. These include his grandiose claims, his practice of sowing confusion, his demand for absolute loyalty, his tendency to lie and create alternative \u201cfacts\u201d and realities, his shunning and belittling of critics and ex-believers, and his cultivating of an \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset. These are the same methods used by Moon, Jones, and other cult leaders such as L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology), David Koresh (Branch Davidians), Lyndon LaRouche (LaRouche PAC), and, most recently, convicted trafficking felon Keith Raniere (NXVIM).\n\nOf all these tactics, the \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset is probably one of the most effective. From the moment you are recruited into a cult, you are made to feel special, part of an \u201cinside\u201d group in opposition to unenlightened, unbelieving, dangerous \u201coutsiders.\u201d Playing on ancient human tribal tendencies, cult leaders extend this \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset outwards to an almost cosmic struggle.\n\nMany campaigns\u2014political, military, athletic\u2014pivot around the idea of conflict between parties. Even in literature there is a hero and a villain. But cults take this human habit of viewing the world in binary terms and infuse it with a kind of all consuming passion, which they reinforce in the minds of followers using cliches, platitudes, lies, and endless repetitions. You come to believe that you are superior to the rest of the world. In fact, everyone who is not in the group is, at some level, in the words of the eminent psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, dispensable.\n\nThe most effective tactics of all are those that play upon followers\u2019 emotions. For this reason, cult leaders often begin by making new recruits feel special, part of an \u201cinside\u201d group in opposition to unenlightened, unbelieving, dangerous \u201coutsiders.\u201d Playing on ancient human tribal tendencies, cult leaders encourage a kind of dualistic \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset, which they then extend outwards to an almost cosmic struggle.\n\n\u201c As did LaRouche, Moon, and Jones, Trump sees a world teeming with enemies. \u201d\n\nIn the Moonies, we were told that we were heavenly soldiers engaged in a great struggle to take the world back from the forces of Satan, which included godless Communism and human-centered Western democracy. Our ultimate goal was to replace these godless human-centered forms of government with a god-centered theocracy, under Moon\u2019s leadership.\n\nJones, a self-professed Marxist, told his followers\u2014who were often poor, black, and disenfranchised\u2014that the enemy was racism, capitalism, and the American government. He took his followers to the wilds of Guyana to escape the clutches of the U.S. government, which was evil and out to get him.\n\nFor Hubbard, the enemy was psychiatrists and governments, and also non-Scientologists. He used a racist term to describe the latter\u2014wogs\u2014and essentially argued that they were inferior to true believers.\n\nFor LaRouche, it was a global conspiracy consisting of the Queen of England, Wall Street, Jews, and various intelligence agencies, such as the CIA. He and his followers wanted to defeat this evil cabal that was destroying the world, which only LaRouche could save.\n\nTrump paints his enemies with a much broader brush. At rallies, he bounds on stage and tell his audiences how special they are\u2014\u201cI love you Indiana\u201d\u2014but it soon becomes clear that he has no \u201clove\u201d for anyone but Trump supporters. During his 2016 campaign, he would single out members of the audience\u2014and even journalists\u2014who he perceived as hostile and eject them, often to deafening cheers from his supporters. Shunning, humiliation, and ostracism are common methods for demonstrating who counts as \u201cus,\u201d and what needs to be done about \u201cthem.\u201d\n\nAs did LaRouche, Moon, and Jones, Trump sees a world teeming with enemies: the \u201cdeep state,\u201d globalists, radical left-wing Democrats, socialists, Hollywood actors, the liberal media. And, of course, Muslims, Mexicans, and migrant caravans. He depicts all of them as wanting to destroy America\u2014and him. Inspiring or creating fear of real or imagined threats overrides people's sense of agency. It makes them susceptible to the confident father figure, Trump, who promises to keep them safe\u2014\u201cOnly I can fix it\u201d\u2014and makes them more compliant and potentially obedient. Some followers of Trump have gone so far as to believe that liberal Democrats, George Soros, and the CIA are involved in an international sex trafficking ring run out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor. One such follower actually brought an AR-15-style rifle into the pizza parlor and fired three shots. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n\n\u201c The dangers of mind control are greater now than ever due to the digital world we are so plugged into. \u201d\n\nWhen I was in the Moonies, I was so indoctrinated that I was prepared to take up arms and die for the cause. I wasn\u2019t alone. My fear is that Trump might order his followers to take their weapons to the streets if he is not re-elected. In a recent tweet, he quoted his Christian Right ally, Robert Jeffress, that his removal from office \u201cwill cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d Worse still is the possibility that, if feeling sufficiently threatened, Trump might, like Jones, try to take others everyone with him, using his access to the nuclear codes. It\u2019s a dark scenario, but not entirely outlandish.\n\nThe good news is, I woke up and got out of a cult, as have millions of people. What I have learned in working with cult members, as I describe in my book, is that attacking their beliefs is doomed to fail. To help them recover their critical faculties, it is essential to develop a warm and positive relationship before teaching them about how mind control works. I often do that by showing how it operates in other groups, like the Jonestown cult or Scientology. We might use the same approach to heal the \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset of Trump\u2019s followers\u2014and also of some of their more rabid opponents. Ultimately, the goal is to educate and inspire people to regain their capacity for critical thinking, and to free their own minds.\n\nI have seen people throw off the mental and emotional shackles of many years\u2014even a lifetime\u2014of destructive conditioning. I believe that love is stronger than fear and that truth is stronger than mind control. But I also believe that the dangers of mind control are greater now than ever due to the digital world we are so plugged into. We ignore the lessons of history\u2014of Jonestown and other destructive groups\u2014at our own peril.", "description": "It might seem an outrageous proposition to compare Donald Trump to a murderous cult leader.
