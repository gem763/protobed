Cause obviously if it's my wife I would marry my wife.'\n\nHis response generated a series of 'Awws!' around the table - and no doubt from viewers watching the sweet moment.\n\nThat's not the only tricky question put to Mike, who was also asked if he would prefer to Leave or Remain in the European Union.\n\nWARNING: CONTAINS SWEARING\n\nMike Tindall and Zara, pictured during the Mike Tindall Celebrity Golf Classic at The Belfry on May 17, 2019 in Sutton Coldfield, married on July 30, 2011\n\nRoyal Family members are notoriously impartial on such political matters - and Mike dealt with the controversial question by pretending to toss a coin and exclaiming: 'Leave!'\n\nWhen asked if he thought England would beat the All Blacks in the semi-final, the ex-player said he would 'like to be proved wrong' but predicted New Zealand would take the win by five points.\n\n'It literally is a 50-50 for me on who turns up on the day,' Mike said - though Haskell backed England all the way.\n\nMike has been in Japan for the last few weeks working on his podcast, House of Rugby, and Zara joined him there ahead of England's final clash against South Africa. It's not known if their two children - Mia, five, and Lena, one, are with them.\n\nIn September the Duchess of Sussex, 38, let her cute monicker for baby Archie slip as she and Prince Harry prepared to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu for tea in Cape Town.\n\nDuring an interview with Alex Payne on the RugbyJoe podcast, Mike and fellow former rugby player James Haskell were challenged to a game of 'would you rather' - and the first question put to Mike is would he rather marry a royal or win the World Cup\n\nMeghan referred to her son as Bubba - usually used in her native America as a term of endearment derived from 'brother', mainly given to boys.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand it's commonly used as a noun to refer affectionately to a baby.\n\nIt's a common trait for royals to give nicknames to each other; Prince George revealed earlier this year that his nickname is Archie, and he called the Queen 'gan-gan' when he struggled to also say the word grandma, according to his mother Kate.\n\nFormer England rugby star Mike Tindall was a member of the squad which won the World Cup in 2003\n\nMeanwhile Meghan has been reportedly called 'Tungsten' by her father-in-law in reference to the strong metal.\n\nPrince Charles has apparently given the Duchess of Sussex the name based on her 'toughness'.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge also has a cheeky name for her husband - calling him 'Prince Baldy' referring to his thinning crown.", "description": "Former England rugby star Mike Tindall, 41, made the revelation about his wife Zara during an interview in Japan ahead of the team's semi-final clash against New Zealand last Saturday.", "authors": ["Hayley Richardson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20370480-0-image-a-332_1572433057104.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
