Elizabeth Warren issued a far-reaching labor-rights plan on Thursday with one overarching goal: to put power in the hands of American workers. Under it, she\u2019s proposing several ideas, including extending labor rights, strengthening unions, increasing the federal minimum wage to $15, expanding discrimination protections, and more.\n\nWomen are particularly in need of workers\u2019 protections. Women, and increasingly women of color, make up a substantial segment of the working class, and women still only earn about 80 cents to every dollar and experience disproportionate amounts of harassment and discrimination at work.\n\n\u201cWomen and women of color have led the fight for workers\u2019 rights \u2014 and they continue to do that today,\u201d Warren tells Refinery29. \u201cThey are locked into lower wages, discriminated against and harassed on the job, and disproportionately work in sectors that are excluded from basic protections. My plan will empower them, help them unionize, and benefit all workers.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in Warren\u2019s workers\u2019 rights plan?\n\nWarren\u2019s plan, among other things, would extend federal labor and safety protections to farm and domestic workers, who are not covered by laws such as the National Labor Relations Act. \u201cSome of these exclusions date back to objections from Southern segregationist politicians in the 1930s, who did not want these workers (in many cases, disproportionately women and people of color both then and still today) to have basic worker protections,\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign said in a statement. \u201cThese exclusions hurt millions of workers and have no justification.\u201d\n\nThe plan also promises to address employee discrimination with new protections, including for women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ people. For example, Warren said she wants to ban federal contractors from asking applicants for previous salary information, a practice that often locks women into lower wages. Warren also wants to pass federal legislation prohibiting discrimination based on \u201ctraits historically associated with race,\u201d such as hair texture, citing the fact that people of color are disproportionately discriminated against due to hairstyles such as dreadlocks.\n\nHow would Warren make her workers\u2019 rights plan happen?\n\nMany of Warren\u2019s proposals would require congressional approval, which means Democrats would have to win back the Senate before they become law. Some of the plans would reverse various Trump administration regulations, like the overtime rule that rolled back an Obama-era regulation which doubled the salary threshold under which workers must receive overtime pay. (Trump\u2019s rule cut pay for about 8 million workers.) Warren promises to push for a new law that would keep future administrations from weakening these types of rules.\n\nWhat do the other 2020 candidates want to do about labor rights?\n\nA few of the other candidates have also put forth ambitious labor proposals. Along with Warren, Sen. Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar all support various pro-worker bills in Congress, including: the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act, and the Raise the Wage Act.\n\nButtigieg has a comprehensive labor-rights proposal that includes extending federal labor and safety protections to farm and domestic workers, paid parental leave, a $15 minimum wage, and letting gig workers unionize.\n\nHarris has focused her labor platform on women, specifically teachers, promising to raise the average U.S. teacher\u2019s salary by $13,500.\n\nSanders\u2019 labor platform focuses on strengthening unions. Last month, he issued a proposal consisting of a series of executive orders and bills to boost union membership, punish union-busting employers, and improve wages and benefits.\n\nCompared to these candidates, Joe Biden, Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang have offered less-detailed labor platforms. Biden supports a $15 minimum wage and wants to make it easier for workers to form unions. Klobuchar would reinstate the Obama-era overtime rule and, as president, promises to \u201cstand up against attempts to weaken our unions.\u201d Yang makes no mention of unions in his platform, but supports paid leave and equal-pay efforts like salary-disclosure laws.\n\nLike what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?\n\nElizabeth Warren Pulls Ahead In New Iowa Poll\n\nWhy Young People Love Liz Warren's \"Real Talk\"\n\nElizabeth Warren Has A Plan For That", "description": "Sen.
