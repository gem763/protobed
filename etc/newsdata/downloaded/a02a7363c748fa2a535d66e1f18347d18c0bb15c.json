Iran has denied responsibility.\n\nSaudi oil attacks More\n\nU.S. government/Digital Globe via AP\n\nThe strike has proved so effective because it struck a key production bottleneck, knocking out in one go around 5% of the world's oil production.\n\nA former CIA officer, Bob Baer, who is now an author and pundit, has long been warning about the vulnerability of the oil processing facility at Abqaiq. It is vulnerable, he says, because it is a bottleneck through which much of Saudi's oil must pass before being exported.\n\nThe facility, spread over hundreds of acres, is filled with very specific and hard-to-replace custom equipment.\n\nSAUDI ATTACK IMAGES More\n\nAP/Business Insider\n\nIn his book, \"Sleeping with the Enemy,\" Baer calls Abqaiq \"the Godzilla of oil-processing facilities.\" He predicted \u2014 seemingly correctly \u2014 that a successful attack could knock offline about 5 million barrels per day of production.\n\nOn Sunday, Saudi officials said that 5 million barrels per day had in fact gone offline. They promised that 2 million barrels could be restored on Monday.\n\nWhile rebutting claims it was responsible, Iran instead it presented the attack as a logical response to Saudi's five year bombing campaign in Yemen. (Iran-backed Houthi rebels have said the attack was their doing.)\n\nThe Iranian response appears designed to reduce pressure on the US to expand the escalating military conflict, while also making the point that the entire world would suffer painful oil shortages if wider war were to break out.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its mercurial crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, entered the Yemeni civil war five years ago and since have conducted massive airstrikes on Houthi targets across Yemen that have terrorized the population while doing very little to degrade Houthi abilities or deter Iran from supporting its Yemeni allies.", "description": "Saudi Aramco officials said Sunday that 5 million barrels per day had been affected, carving a 5%-sized hole in the world's total oil supply.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A_K.sh1lAK6ut8iuWcjASQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/91b039e1b0fafef4f6ea23af114f8c2c", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
