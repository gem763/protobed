He managed just two games this year.\n\n\u201cScott has been a much-loved member of the club over his four years here. The way in which he has conducted himself on and off the field, has earned him great respect from his teammates and coaches,\u201d football manager Simon Lloyd said.\n\n\u201cScott is always welcome at the club, and we wish him well in his future endeavours. We hope to see a new opportunity come his way in football as he has a lot to offer.\u201d\n\nLast week the Cats delisted Jordan Cunico and Jamaine Jones. They are also expected to lose star midfielder Tim Kelly in the trade period.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SACKED PODCAST\n\nMORE NEWS:\n\n\n\nEVERY LIST CHANGE\n\nADELAIDE\n\nAndy Otten (retired)\n\nRichard Douglas (retired)\n\nPaul Hunter (delisted)\n\nSam Jacobs (free agent)\n\nCam Ellis-Yolmen (free agent)\n\n\n\nBRISBANE LIONS\n\nLuke Hodge (retired)\n\nCARLTON\n\nTom Bugg (retired)\n\nJarrod Pickett (delisted)\n\nDale Thomas (retired)\n\nAlex Fasolo (retired)\n\nJarrod Garlett (delisted)\n\nPatrick Kerr (delisted)\n\nMatthew Lobbe (delisted)\n\nAngus Schumacher (delisted)\n\nKym LeBois (delisted)\n\nStream every match of the 2019 Toyota AFL Finals Series before the Grand Final Live & On-Demand on KAYO SPORTS.
