The reasons why these homes are classified as vacant vary. Some are in popular vacation areas and are used only seasonally. Others are on the market, waiting for a renter or a buyer. Many are effectively abandoned.\n\nNationwide, only about 1.6% of single-family homes are vacant. In some parts of the country, however, vacancy rates are many times the national figure, exceeding 20%, and even 30% in the most extreme cases.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed the share of single-family homes that were unoccupied as of the end of the third quarter of 2019 to identify the 30 ZIP codes with the highest vacancy rates \u2013 America\u2019s ghost towns. Vacancy rates in these areas, which were calculated by ATTOM Data Solutions using tax assessor data, range from 16% to 31.3%.\n\nThe majority of ZIP codes on this list tend to be in urban areas in the South and Midwest. The majority of these areas with nation-leading vacancy rates are in Rust Belt cities. These cities have been hollowed out by the decline of American manufacturing and have little to offer in the way of economic opportunity.\n\nEach of the 30 ZIP codes on this list has a poverty rate of more than 30% \u2013 which is more than double the comparable national poverty rate of 14.6%. Many of these ZIP codes are concentrated within a single city. Gary, Indiana; Flint, Michigan; Cleveland; and Detroit have multiple ZIP codes on this list. These cities are relatively poor, and some rank among the poorest nationwide.\n\nHigh vacancy rates are indicative of low demand for housing, and most of these areas have reported a population decline in the past five years. The reduced demand has probably led to declining home values.\n\nIn 28 of the ZIP codes on this list, the typical home is worth less than $75,000. For context, the median home value nationwide is $193,500.\n\nIs your money safe?

There are about 10,700 single-family homes in the area northwest of downtown, and 1,720 of them are vacant, or 16%.\n\nAs is the case in most places on this list, people are moving out of the 48238 ZIP code. In the past five years, the population has declined by 8.6%. The typical area home is worth $34,800.\n\n29.

Of the 2,167 homes in the area, 350 are vacant. The area's vacancy rate of 16.2% may be partially attributable to population decline.\n\nMore than one of three residents live below the poverty line, and most households earn less than $25,000 a year.\n\n28. ZIP 35218 (Birmingham, Alabama)\n\n\u2022 Vacant homes: 316 (16.2%)\n\n\u2022 5-year population change: -5.3%\n\n\u2022 Population: 7,097\n\n\u2022 Median home value: $63,800\n\nThe population exodus may be attributable in part to a lack of economic opportunity.

ZIP 46208 (Indianapolis)\n\n\u2022 Vacant homes: 1,337 (16.4%)\n\n\u2022 5-year population change: 2.3%\n\n\u2022 Population: 23,300\n\n\u2022 Median home value: $103,900\n\nRelatively few vacant properties in the area are abandoned; the majority are classified as investment properties, meaning they are probably either on the rental market or waiting to be sold at a profit by the owner. In the past five years, the value of the typical home fell from $108,300 to $103,900, a 4.1% drop.\n\n26.

Across Baltimore as a whole, there are about 17,000 vacant properties, which have dragged down property values for about a decade.\n\nOf the 2,190 vacant homes in the area, more than 1,500 are classified as investment properties, which suggests that their owners may be renovating them or waiting for them to appreciate to sell. Unlike many ZIP codes on this list, property values are on the rise in this part of Baltimore. The typical area home is worth $130,500, a 15.6% increase from the median home value in the area five years earlier.\n\n24.

For the past 10 years, there have been about 17,000 vacant buildings across the city. In an effort to reduce that number, Housing Commissioner Michael Braverman pledged to demolish about 2,000 of them in the next year. The 21223 ZIP code has already seen some improvement, as there are about 60 fewer vacant properties than there were a year ago.\n\n21.

Most area households have an income of less than $24,000 a year, and 42.5% of the population live below the poverty line.\n\n19.

It may be a while before a real estate investment in the area pays off. The typical area home is worth $54,600, down 10.2% from five years ago. Over the same period, the typical American home has appreciated in value by 9.5%.\n\n17.

It is one of several parts of the Missouri city to have near nation-leading home vacancy rates. The problem has gotten considerably worse. Last year, there were only 670 vacant properties in the area.\n\nHigh vacancy rates can be tied to higher crime rates, and St. Louis is a relatively dangerous city. There were 455 violent crimes in greater St. Louis for every 100,000 people, well above the national violent crime rate of 369 per 100,000.\n\n16. ZIP 46016 (Anderson, Indiana)\n\n\u2022 Vacant homes: 1,248 (17.6%)\n\n\u2022 5-year population change: -3.1%\n\n\u2022 Population: 18,300\n\n\u2022 Median home value: $41,500\n\nThe urban decay evidenced by the large share of vacant properties is due in part to poor regional economic conditions. About 38.2% of area residents live below the poverty line, more than double the 14.6% national poverty rate.\n\nAnderson is within the Indianapolis metro area, which ranks among the most dangerous in the country. There were 642 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in greater Indianapolis in 2018, far more than the 369 per 100,000 national violent crime rate.\n\n15.

Few cities have been hit as hard by the decline of American manufacturing as Detroit.\n\nNearly 38% of area residents live below the poverty line, and the unemployment rate across the broader Detroit metro area stands at 4.5% as of August, well above the comparable national unemployment rate of 3.8%.\n\nZIP 44108 (Cleveland) (Photo: Tim Evanson / Flickr)\n\n10.

The rapid population decline has led to reduced demand for housing. The typical area home is worth $56,400, down 15.3% from half a decade ago.\n\nLike most ZIP codes on this list, 44108 is in a city that has long suffered economically from the decline of American manufacturing. Since the industry began to decline and factories began to close in the mid-20th century, the city's population was more than halved, from more than 900,000 as of 1950 to less than 400,000.\n\n9.

The typical area home is worth $22,100, about $170,000 below the value of the typical American home.\n\nEconomic problems and population decline across Youngstown began in the 1970s and '80s, when the city's once dominant steel industry declined. The lack of economic opportunity in the area remains a root cause of the high vacancy rate. Across the broader Youngstown metro area, August 2019 unemployment stands at 6%, well above the 3.8% national unemployment rate.\n\n6.

The city, which was economically distressed after the declining presence of General Motors as a major employer, was hit with a public health crisis after it was discovered in 2015 that the city's water supply was contaminated with dangerous levels of lead.\n\nThe crisis pushed many out of the city and provided little incentive for any would-be buyers to invest in area real estate. The typical house is worth $22,700.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify America\u2019s 30 ghost towns, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the share of single-family homes and condos that are unoccupied in 16,148 ZIP codes with at least 1,000 single family homes and condos. Occupancy status was determined by ATTOM Data Solutions using tax assessor data for the end of the third quarter in 2019.\n\nTo better identify areas with vacancy rates that remain high year round and are not likely to decrease significantly in the near future, we considered only ZIP codes with five-year population growth of less than 5%. We excluded ZIP codes where a large share of properties are vacant probably because of seasonal variation. This includes beach towns and places and other vacation destinations.\n\nMedian household income, median home value, poverty rates and population at the ZIP code level are all five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2017 American Community Survey. Five-year changes in population and median home value from 2013 to 2017 are also from the ACS. Violent crime and homicide rates at the metro area level are from the FBI\u2019s 2018 Uniform Crime Report.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
