Update: \u201cI will have my say in due course\u201d", "language": "en", "text": "How strained must this relationship have been for Trump to take the unusual step of canning this guy? You know how he likes to handle \u201cproblem\u201d advisors \u2014 marginalizing them, making his disapproval of them known, but keeping them in their positions for many months if need be. Ask Jeff Sessions or John Kelly or Jerome Powell, they\u2019ll you all about it.\n\nNot Bolton. He\u2019s done, as of last night. What the hell happened?\n\nIf a super-hawk natsec advisor and an isolationist autocrat-hugging president can\u2019t make it work in this topsy turvy world, what hope do the rest of us have?\n\nI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\n\u2026.I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service. I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2019\n\nSomeone forgot to tell the White House comms team:\n\nSo according to Trump, he fired Bolton last night. ~12 hours later, the White House press office was apparently unaware of this and announced Bolton would be at a press conference. Bizarre. \u2014 Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) September 10, 2019\n\nBolton is chiming in too:\n\nI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019\n\nDid they talk about it today? Or was the \u201cdiscussion\u201d limited to Trump blindsiding him with this morning\u2019s tweets?\n\nNot a good sign for POTUS if Bolton is already airing details of his private conversations with Trump.\n\nAnyway, his exit was months in the making. Back in May, with tensions rising between the U.S. and Iran, Trump\u2019s Fox buddy Tucker Carlson began taking hard shots at him on the air for his hawkishness. It got worse in June when Trump canceled a bombing strike on Iran at the last minute against the advice of Bolton, among others; Carlson took to telling Fox viewers that Bolton was a \u201cbureaucratic tapeworm\u201d and Trump reportedly lamented to a confidant about his own natsec advisors, \u201cThese people want to push us into a war, and it\u2019s so disgusting.\u201d A few weeks later, Bolton was conspicuously absent from Trump\u2019s big photo op with Kim Jong Un at the DMZ, having been tasked with a visit to Mongolia at the time instead. (Ironically, Carlson did accompany Trump, albeit as part of Fox\u2019s team.)\n\nThings seemed to deteriorate from there. The most hardcore Republican Bolton critic in Congress, Rand Paul, was deputized by Trump in July to try to broker negotiations with Iran. (Paul is already celebrating Bolton\u2019s termination on Twitter today.) More recently reports being bubbling up that Bolton had been sidelined from the peace process in Afghanistan and was being excluded from meetings. Rumors began circulating that his relationship with Mike Pompeo, a Trump favorite, had collapsed, with natsec deputies unsure who was actually steering the diplomatic ship between the more negotiation-minded Pompeo and the more hardline Bolton.\n\nThe final straw may have been Bolton reportedly (and correctly) urging Trump to resist his instincts to invite the Taliban to Camp David for peace talks. If anything finished him off in Trump\u2019s eyes, it may have been the public perception over the last 48 hours that his NSA was right about that and showed \u201ctoughness\u201d and judgment that Trump lacked. In fact, Trump may have suspected Bolton or his team of leaking the fact that Bolton opposed Trump\u2019s idea and chose to axe him for that reason. The president hates when his aides get the glory that he thinks he deserves, as Steve Bannon might tell you.\n\nI never understood why Trump hired him to begin with. Right, he\u2019s \u201cgood on TV\u201d \u2014 the cardinal virtue in Trump\u2019s eyes \u2014 and his reputation for hawkishness was of some use to Trump in negotiating with foreign powers, letting him play good cop to Bolton\u2019s bad cop. But they were destined to clash. Trump is clearly more dovish on foreign policy than Washington\u2019s hawkish Republican establishment and Bolton, if anything, is more hawkish. The marriage was doomed from the start.\n\nStand by for updates. And prepare for withdrawal from a variety of theaters overseas, now that Trump has one less hawk around him pressuring him the other way. Maybe we\u2019ll even get that Camp David cocktail party with the Taliban after all.\n\nUpdate: You can\u2019t fire me, says Bolton. I quit!\n\n\"John Bolton just texted me,\" @kilmeade says live on Fox News, where Bolton was a former contributor. \"He said, 'Let's be clear, I resigned.'\" \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) September 10, 2019\n\nWhy did he resign last night? Did Trump make some as-yet-unknown dovish foreign policy decision that Bolton couldn\u2019t live with, a la Mattis resigning after being given the order to withdraw from Syria? Bolton has a reputation as a crafty \u201cinside game\u201d operator against his enemies. If embarrassing natsec revelations start appearing in the media, don\u2019t be surprised.\n\nUpdate: My best guess at Bolton\u2019s replacement is Keith Kellogg, who served as acting NSA for a week after Mike Flynn was fired in 2017, signed on to become Mike Pence\u2019s NSA a year later, and has been publishing Trumpish op-eds over the past year like \u201cTime to leave Syria.\u201d Trump even cited him as a possible permanent replacement for Flynn two years ago before opting for H.R. McMaster.\n\nMaybe he\u2019ll surprise us and choose Tulsi Gabbard instead. The Camp David champagne-glass-clinking with Assad and his death squad will be a momentous diplomatic triumph.\n\nUpdate: The left\u2019s Strange New Respect for John Bolton begins in the person of Dem Sen. Chris Murphy.\n\nMaybe I'm a simpleton but it seems like if you criticized Bolton's hiring you probably shouldn't also criticize his firing. pic.twitter.com/iRIGNDc28A \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 10, 2019\n\nUpdate: Eventually the disagreements couldn\u2019t be papered over.\n\nHave similar reporting \u2013 West Wing officials said Bolton didn\u2019t want to defend Trump on Russia being readmitted to G7. People close to Bolton insisted it was because he didn\u2019t want to be the front person talking about tariffs, per multiple sources, which made little sense. https://t.co/qcop2GVK2F \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 10, 2019\n\nAnd yes, per Haberman, Bolton may have taken the blame for leaks about the meeting with the Taliban at Camp David, rightly or wrongly:\n\nLots of people saying the leaks related to the Camp David meeting, including about Pence\u2019s stance, infuriated POTUS. \u2014 Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) September 10, 2019\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s going to get ugly.
