REUTERS/Vincent Kessler\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said he and the European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier were doing all they could to get a Brexit deal, and if they failed it would be Britain\u2019s responsibility.\n\nIn an interview with a German newspaper, Juncker said he and Barnier were working intensively for a deal, because it would be a catastrophe for Britain and Europe if Britain left the EU without an organised withdrawal process.\n\n\u201cOur chief negotiator Michel Barnier and I are doing everything possible to get an agreement,\u201d he told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t succeed in the end, the responsibility would lie exclusively on the British side.\u201d\n\nBritain is scheduled to leave the EU on Oct. 31. Officials in Brussels say Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made little progress in negotiating a new exit deal to replace the one agreed by his predecessor Theresa May, but which was rejected three times by the British parliament.\n\nJuncker added that negotiations on a future trade relationship between Britain and the EU would be greatly complicated by a disorderly Brexit.\n\n\u201cWe will want to and need to seal a free trade agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that won\u2019t happen just like that, as some in Britain imagine. Some of the trade deals we sealed in my term of office took many years to reach.\u201d", "description": "Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said he and the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier were doing all they could to get a Brexit deal, and if they failed it would be Britain's responsibility.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434368134&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q05T", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
