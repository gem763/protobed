It is an image he is trying to change.\n\nSri Lanka's former wartime defense secretary and presidential candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa shares a moment with Muslims during his visit at Ketchimale mosque in Beruwala, Sri Lanka August 17, 2019. REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte\n\nWhen he was defense chief in his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s government he crushed ethnic Tamil separatist rebels, bringing a 26-year-long civil war to a close. But relatives of dead or missing Tamils have accused him of war crimes, including extra-judicial killings and abductions, in lawsuits filed against him in the United States.\n\nRajapaksa has denied the accusations.\n\nHis failure to publicly distance himself from radical Buddhist monks makes him a figure of suspicion in the minority Muslim community, as well as among some in the small Christian community.\n\nIn 2013, he was chief guest at the opening of a leadership academy run by a hardline Buddhist group, the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS). Groups such as BBS see the minorities as a potential threat to the Sinhala Buddhist majority in Sri Lanka.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped Rajapaksa and his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party from seeking to woo Muslim and Christian voters after he recently declared he was standing in the election due to be held by Dec. 9.\n\nHis overtures might work in parts of the Christian community fearful after Easter Sunday bombings of churches and hotels by Islamist militants that killed 250 people.\n\nSome Christians say they are looking for stronger security policies, even if that means going with a hardliner like Rajapaksa.\n\nBut Muslims are less convinced because they suspect a Rajapaksa government may turn a blind eye to attacks by Buddhist extremists. That is what some say happened in 2014 when anti-Muslim riots in the southwestern Kalutara district displaced thousands during the time of his brother\u2019s presidency.\n\nA spokesman for the Rajapaksa\u2019s SLPP, Keheliya Rambukwella, said the riots were orchestrated to turn Muslims away from the Rajapaksa camp.\n\nAs a politician who respected all communities and religions, Rajapaksa was doing the \u201cright thing\u201d by visiting houses of worship, Rambukwella said.\n\n\u201cIt gives a message very clearly that he wants communal harmony.\u201d\n\nRajapaksa\u2019s office declined a request for an interview with him.\n\nTAMIL FEARS\n\nHe has yet to tour the Tamil-dominated north and east of Sri Lanka but has said he would work toward fulfilling their aspirations, including more regional autonomy.\n\nRelatives of Tamils missing since the end of the war, former cadres of the Tamil Tiger insurgent group and people who say their land has been occupied by the military, interviewed by Reuters in recent days, said they feared a military clampdown if Rajapaksa rose to power.\n\nBut one Tamil party, the Eelam People\u2019s Democratic Party, is pro-Rajapaksa and says only his leadership can fulfill regional demands.\n\nThe political calculations are clear. While Sri Lanka is 70%Sinhala Buddhist, some Buddhists support current Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s rival center-right United National Party (UNP).\n\nMuslims account for about 10% of the island nation\u2019s 21 million population and Christians nearly 7%.\n\nHardline Buddhist monks enjoyed impunity during Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s government, antagonizing minorities who voted overwhelmingly against him in 2015, said Hilmy Ahamed, vice president of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka.\n\nMuslims would not be safe if Rajapaksa won the presidential election, said A.R.M Badiuddin, a former local council head in Dharga Town, about 80 km south of Colombo, which was caught up in the 2014 riots.\n\n\u201cThe Rajapaksas have betrayed us,\u201d said Badiuddin, on a day Rajapaksa was due to visit a historic mosque, near his village home.\n\n\u201cMuslims won\u2019t forget and won\u2019t help them.\u201d\n\nBLESSINGS AT THE MOSQUE\n\nOn Aug. 17, the centuries old Kechimale Mosque, which looks out over the Indian Ocean, was unusually busy for a Saturday evening as it prepared for the first ever visit by Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother, Mahinda. Hundreds waited for nearly four hours before they arrived in the late evening.\n\nInside the mosque, a cleric sought blessings for Gotabaya Rajapaksa so he could ensure \u201cunity and equality for all ethnicities in Sri Lanka\u201d.\n\nClerics said they welcomed everyone, declining to comment on the politics of the visit.\n\nRajapaksa is also trying to win over Sri Lanka\u2019s Catholics, many of whom have traditionally voted UNP.\n\nThis month, he met senior Catholic priests in Kandy and Matara. He recently said his government would promptly act on a demand by the Archbishop of Colombo to set up an independent panel to investigate the Easter bomb attacks.\n\nSome were skeptical of the motive but said Rajapaksa, nevertheless, might win the support of Christians.\n\n\u201cEverything is done to win votes, not in a genuine way,\u201d a senior clergyman told Reuters on condition of anonymity/\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility this time that Catholics will vote for Gotabaya.\u201d\n\nMahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s wife, Shiranthi, is Catholic and the couple met the Pope at the Vatican in 2014 and during his 2015 Sri Lanka visit. Shiranthi also donated land and money to a Catholic church in Colombo during Rajapaksa\u2019s term.\n\n\u201cThey helped us a lot\u201d, the clergyman added.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nBut Rajapaksa\u2019s authoritarian style worries many Protestants, who make up about 2% of the population.\n\n\u201cPeople are waiting to see whether he would actually say that he is moving from a very hardline stance to a more moderate stance,\u201d said Godfrey Yogarajah, deputy secretary general of the World Evangelical Alliance.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard him say anything at all to that effect.\u201d", "description": "Sri Lanka presidential candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa has been a polarizing figure for much of his political life.
