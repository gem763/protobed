If approved by Cabinet, it will be gazetted soon after.\n\nThe Integrated Resource Plan describes the state's plan for future energy generation, including projected electricity demand, cost estimates, and from what sources power will be generated. It will outline the state's thinking on the decommissioning of coal power stations, the role of nuclear power, and the growth of renewable energy. It is expected to be based, largely, on a draft plan published for comment in 2018.\n\nMantashe was addressing the Windaba Summit on wind energy in Cape Town. He said government support for wind energy and other renewables should not be seen as a \"war on other technologies\", saying the country needs a balanced energy approach.\n\nMantashe told delegates the IRP is a critical step in ensuring \u201ccertainty and stability\u201d in South Africa\u2019s energy sector.\n\n\"As ministers, we will be attending the Cabinet committee this week, where we will brief Cabinet on the IRP. We will officially table it before Cabinet next Wednesday and, if Cabinet approves, it will be gazetted.\n\nThe minister said that, in the meantime, investors in SA's renewables sector should work more aggressively to pursue investment in bankable projects, rather than worry about government\u2019s commitment to other energy technologies.", "description": "The Integrated Resource Plan describes the state's plan for future energy generation, including projected electricity demand, cost estimated, and energy sources.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7631/5fb92420a3804ab6b128e540105abdfd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
