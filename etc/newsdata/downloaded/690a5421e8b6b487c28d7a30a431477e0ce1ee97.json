He says it is better to leave my phone out of my room and concentrate on studying rather than listening to music. Is it OK to listen to songs when I am studying? \u2013 Robert, Year 11 student.\n\nIt\u2019s a good question! In a nutshell, music puts us in a better mood, which makes us better at studying \u2013 but it also distracts us, which makes us worse at studying.\n\n\n\nSo if you want to study effectively with music, you want to reduce how distracting music can be, and increase the level to which the music keeps you in a good mood.\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Why do adults think video games are bad?\n\nMusic can put us in a better mood\n\nYou may have heard of the Mozart effect \u2013 the idea that listening to Mozart makes you \u201csmarter\u201d. This is based on research that found listening to complex classical music like Mozart improved test scores, which the researcher argued was based on the music\u2019s ability to stimulate parts of our minds that play a role in mathematical ability.\n\nHowever, further research conclusively debunked the Mozart effect theory: it wasn\u2019t really anything to do with maths, it was really just that music puts us in a better mood.\n\nResearch conducted in the 1990s found a \u201cBlur Effect\u201d \u2013 where kids who listened to the BritPop band Blur seemed to do better on tests. In fact, researchers found that the Blur effect was bigger than the Mozart effect, simply because kids enjoyed pop music like Blur more than classical music.\n\nBeing in a better mood likely means that we try that little bit harder and are willing to stick with challenging tasks.\n\nMusic can distract us\n\nOn the other hand, music can be a distraction \u2013 under certain circumstances.\n\nWhen you study, you\u2019re using your \u201cworking memory\u201d \u2013 that means you are holding and manipulating several bits of information in your head at once.\n\nThe research is fairly clear that when there\u2019s music in the background, and especially music with vocals, our working memory gets worse.\n\nLikely as a result, reading comprehension decreases when people listen to music with lyrics. Music also appears to be more distracting for people who are introverts than for people who are extroverts, perhaps because introverts are more easily overstimulated.\n\nSome clever work by an Australia-based researcher called Bill Thompson and his colleagues aimed to figure out the relative effect of these two competing factors - mood and distraction.\n\nThey had participants do a fairly demanding comprehension task, and listen to classical music that was either slow or fast, and which was either soft or loud.\n\nThey found the only time there was any real decrease in performance was when people were listening to music that was both fast and loud (that is, at about the speed of Shake It Off by Taylor Swift, at about the volume of a vacuum cleaner).\n\nBut while that caused a decrease in performance, it wasn\u2019t actually that big a decrease. And other similar research also failed to find large differences.\n\nSo\u2026 can I listen to music while studying or not?\n\nTo sum up: research suggest it\u2019s probably fine to listen to music while you\u2019re studying - with some caveats.\n\nIt\u2019s better if:\n\nit puts you in a good mood\n\nit\u2019s not too fast or too loud\n\nit\u2019s less wordy (and hip-hop, where the words are rapped rather than sung, is likely to be even more distracting)\n\nyou\u2019re not too introverted.\n\nHappy listening and good luck in your exams!\n\nRead more: Curious Kids: Why do old people hate new music?\n\nHello, curious kids!
