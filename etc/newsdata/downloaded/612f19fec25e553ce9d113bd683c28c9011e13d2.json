But after he started a new company with a wildly speculative business plan in 2012, Epstein had no problem pulling in cash.\n\nHis startup, Southern Trust, reported more than $200 million in revenues over the next five years, according to a review of previously unreported financial statements filed in the Virgin Islands.\n\nDespite a name that calls to mind a financial services firm, the fledgling company with a handful of employees said it was developing a DNA data-mining service. Southern Trust was trying to gauge customers\u2019 predisposition to cancer by \u201cbasically organizing mathematical algorithms,\u201d Epstein told Virgin Islands officials as he sought a lucrative tax break in 2012.\n\nEpstein\u2019s business revival is documented in financial statements and other filings obtained by The New York Times. The documents \u2014 from Southern Trust and his earlier firm, Financial Trust \u2014 offer a glimpse of Epstein\u2019s mysterious finances. They show that Financial Trust peaked at the end of 2004, when it reported $563 million in assets and net income of $108 million. And they demonstrate how Epstein rebuilt his business in his later years, with Southern Trust reporting $175 million in retained earnings \u2014 leftover profits that can be reinvested \u2014 in 2017, the last year for which statements were available.\n\nBut the documents do not say who was paying vast sums of money to Epstein\u2019s new venture just a few years after his 2008 guilty plea to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Nor do they offer an explanation for why customers would hand over money to a man who had apparently switched from financial services to DNA research.\n\nThey do, however, offer a reason for that sudden change in focus. In 2012, Epstein asked the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority to note that Financial Trust no longer managed money, so it would not have to register with federal securities regulators as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. Later that year, Financial Trust was replaced by Southern Trust, which Epstein told territorial officials would still maintain a \u201cfinancial arm.\u201d\n\nThe single-page unaudited financial statements for both companies \u2014 obtained through a public-records lawsuit against the territory\u2019s Division of Corporations and Trademarks \u2014 are littered with curious line items.\n\nAt Financial Trust, a company with fewer than a dozen employees, investment expenses varied widely, from $1.3 million in 2000 to $16 million in 2004 to $42 million in 2005. In 2006 \u2014 the year Epstein was charged in Florida \u2014 Financial Trust pushed $117 million into an unnamed subsidiary whose purpose was undisclosed. The subsidiary was apparently transferred to Southern Trust in 2013, and by the end of 2017 the subsidiary accounted for more than half of the company\u2019s $391 million in assets. The filings also disclose that Southern Trust received a $30.5 million loan that same year, but do not say who provided it.\n\nOne thing the financial statements make clear: Epstein paid himself handsomely. He pocketed $400 million in dividends and other payments from the companies starting in 1999 \u2014 the first full year after he moved his operations to the Virgin Islands from New York.\n\nThe opacity of Epstein\u2019s financial dealings has been a perplexing issue since he was arrested in July on federal charges of sex trafficking with underage girls. Although the criminal case against him closed after he killed himself in federal custody in August, Epstein\u2019s finances remain an important matter for women who are suing his estate claiming they were among his victims.\n\nTwo days before he killed himself, Epstein signed a will that placed his estate \u2014 estimated in court records at more than $500 million \u2014 into a trust, potentially an attempt to shield it from public scrutiny. The will lists Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, two longtime associates, as executors.\n\nThe financial statements and accompanying documents reviewed by The Times were signed at various times by Indyke, a lawyer who incorporated dozens of Epstein\u2019s companies, and Kahn, a New York accountant. Indyke served as president of Financial Trust for two years, which included the period that Epstein was serving a prison sentence in Florida after his 2008 guilty plea.", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's biggest client had deserted him, his money management firm had lost more than $150 million during the financial crisis, and he was a registered sex offender.
