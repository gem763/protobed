It is a parental responsibility as defined in the Children\u2019s Act. The duty to maintain a child arises when the child is born and continues until such time as the child becomes self-supporting.\n\nThe duty is not dependant on the child\u2019s age (in other words, the duty to maintain does not end when a child becomes a major at the age of 18), whether the child is adopted, born in or out of wedlock or whether the child is born of the first or subsequent marriage.\n\nPresumption of paternity\n\nThere is a presumption in law, that when a woman is legally married to a man and a child is born during the course of the marriage, that her husband is the biological father of the child.\n\nThe presumption can be rebutted, if the man is able to prove that he is not the biological father. Should the man dispute being the biological father of the child, the court will order for a blood test to be done and even though blood tests are not 100% accurate, they can be as accurate as 99.9%.\n\nOnce the father\u2019s paternity has been established, either by acceptance or through a paternity test, the duty on the part of the father to maintain the child commences.\n\nIn the case of adoption, once a child has been adopted, the adoptive parent\u2019s duty to maintain the child commences and will continue until the child is self-supporting.\n\nPregnancy expenses\n\nA mother is entitled to claim what are known as 'lying in expenses' \u2013 these are reasonable costs a mother has incurred while pregnant to carry the baby and to prepare for the birth of the baby. These expenses can only be claimed after the birth of the baby and once paternity has been determined.\n\nLying in expenses refer to doctors appointments, hospital expenses and necessary toiletries for the baby.\n\nThe expenses must be reasonable but relate to the baby only. It does not include personal expenses of the mother, such as food and housing.\n\nBoth parents have a duty\n\nWhere the parents are married to one another, generally there will be no dispute in regard to when the duty to maintain the child arises as both parents have a duty to ensure that the child\u2019s needs are met.\n\nThe dispute regarding the duty to maintain usually arises where the father disputes paternity, the parties are not married at the time of the child\u2019s birth or where the parties get divorced and the child is still a dependant.\n\nParents can enter into an agreement to regulate maintenance for the child. The agreement will regulate maintenance until the child becomes self-supporting.\n\nHowever, in the event that there is a change circumstances (for example, an increase or decrease in income or a change in the child\u2019s expenses), that parent may approach the maintenance court to change the maintenance payable.\n\nWhere no agreement exists regulating a child\u2019s maintenance and when a parent requires maintenance, that parent may apply for a maintenance order at the Maintenance Court.\n\nPast, present and future maintenance\n\nThe court will hear the matter, and will make an order in terms of past, present and future maintenance.\n\nWhere a child has reached the age of majority, that is, 18 years of age, and there is no agreement in place regulating maintenance, that child will need to apply to court for a maintenance order against one or both parents.\n\nChildren\u2019s maintenance includes, but is not limited to, the day-to-day living expenses of the child, school fees, additional school expenses, tertiary education, medical expenses and the child\u2019s portion of the monthly household expenses, for example, rent, water and lights, and such.\n\nTo calculate an amount see How much maintenance money must a parent pay?\n\nA criminal offence\n\nFailure to pay maintenance is a criminal offence, and the offending parent may have his or her assets attached, face having a portion of his or her salary attached on a monthly basis (known as a garnishee order) and may be ordered to pay a fine or face imprisonment for up to three years, or both.\n\nCompiled for Parent24 by Elizabeth Mamacos\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
