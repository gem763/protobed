Leah was a hugely popular member of the Emmerdale cast for over 16 years.\n\n\u201cDuring that time, she featured in some of the show\u2019s most high-profile and explosive plots and always delivered a pitch-perfect performance.\n\n\u201cZoe Tate was one of soap\u2019s first lesbian characters and Leah made sure the character was both exciting and credible. Leah herself was a very generous and caring colleague, much loved by cast and crew alike.\u201d\n\nBracknell\u2019s stage four lung cancer diagnosis came to light in October 2016 when her husband, Jez Hughes, launched a fundraising page to help her access treatment overseas, due to a lack of options available on the NHS.\n\nFans helped Bracknell raise more than \u00a350,000 to undergo treatment in Germany. She started taking new medication, but later revealed it had failed.\n\nA statement from Bracknell\u2019s manager on behalf of her family said: \u201cThey would like to thank all the public for their support and generosity, which contributed to the extension and quality of her life over the past three years.\n\n\u201cLeah continued to embrace life and faced her illness with positivity. Many aspects of her journey can be found on her blog.\n\n\u201cLeah was best known and much loved as Zoe Tate in Emmerdale. She also had roles in Judge John Deed, A Touch Of Frost, The Royal Today and DCI Banks, to name just a few, as well as numerous appearances on stage and in pantomime.\n\n\u201cAs well as acting, Leah was also an accomplished yoga teacher and shamanic healer. Leah had an energy and enthusiasm for life, a kind heart and much love to give to those around her. Her family have asked for privacy at this very sad time.\u201d", "description": "Soap star who played Zoe Tate for 16 years was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in 2016", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f13a4036a54c4c6987649f7682e0369857595a5e/0_52_1312_787/master/1312.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3769962cee982d1871ea15793eb1a273", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
