That\u2019s not the case anymore. Most people get that Chromebooks can cover much more of their computing needs than before. A good Chromebook is more useful than a mediocre Windows laptop.\n\nIn fact, the message that people actually want good Chromebooks \u2014 instead of just cheap ones \u2014 has gotten through to manufacturers. As long as you\u2019re willing to spend around $500 or $600, you can get something great. That\u2019s more than we used to recommend people spend on Chromebooks, but that extra money goes a long way toward getting something you\u2019ll be happy with.\n\nFor the first time, the quality of laptops in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from HP, Asus, Acer, and Dell that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they\u2019re all sourcing their components from the same factory.\n\nThat\u2019s great news if you\u2019re comparison shopping. We have a pick for our favorite and a runner-up, but the majority of laptops on this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. Those discounts appear fairly regularly, too (with the exception of Google\u2019s Pixelbook, which remains maddeningly expensive).\n\nWhat you want in a good Chromebook are the same things you want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but there\u2019s still one that rises above the rest.\n\nThe best Chromebook right now: Asus Chromebook Flip C434\n\nAsus has a strong history of making good Chromebooks, but the C434 is something special. It\u2019s nearly unique among this class of laptops in offering a big 14-inch screen in a laptop body that\u2019s much closer in size to a 13-inch model. It pulls off that trick by minimizing the bezels around the screen, which is the same thing the best Windows laptops have been doing lately.\n\nAsus nailed the basics, too. The keyboard is great to type on, though it does have the annoying problem of being hard to see in dim lighting because the backlight is the same color as the keycaps. The trackpad is accurate, and I appreciate that there\u2019s not only a USB-A port but that the two USB-C ports are on opposite sides of the laptop so you can plug in on the side you prefer.\n\nThere\u2019s even a microSD card slot for expanded storage \u2014 and you might need it, as it only comes with 64GB. The processor isn\u2019t the most powerful one you can get in a Chromebook in this price range, but it should be enough for most tasks, especially if you follow our recommendation to get the model with 8GB of RAM. Unless it\u2019s wildly more expensive, it\u2019s totally worth it: as of this writing, the extra RAM only costs an extra $30 on Amazon, which is as close to a no-brainer as you can get.\n\nOur review of Asus Chromebook Flip (C434TA) Verge Score 8.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Tiny bezels\n\nGood performance\n\nGreat hinge\n\nGood price Bad Stuff Keyboard is hard to see in dim light\n\nSo-so speakers Buy for $569.99 from Best Buy Buy for $529.00 from B&H\n\nIn a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Asus sets itself apart by making a laptop that just feels better-made. It has a 360-degree hinge, but when you open it up in laptop mode, it subtly drops the screen down, minimizing the appearance of the bezel even further.\n\nA potentially cheaper, more powerful option: HP Chromebook x360 14\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to get more power and you don\u2019t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. Instead of the Asus\u2019 8th Gen Core m3 Y-series processor, you\u2019ll get a Core i3 U-series processor, which is slightly more powerful. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with that i3 processor.\n\nWhile we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn\u2019t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.\n\nOur review of HP Chromebook X360 (14-da0011dx) Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff B&O speakers\n\nNice trackpad\n\nFine performance Bad Stuff Big-ish bezels\n\nDisplay doesn\u2019t get very bright\n\nHigher price when not on sale Buy for $449.00 from Amazon Buy for $449.00 from Best Buy\n\nThe thing that puts the HP Chromebook x360 14 above the rest is it appears to often be heavily discounted from its original price. We regularly see it sell for well under $500.\n\nThe rest\n\nQuality on Chromebooks can, unfortunately, vary widely once you get below $400 or so. It's possible to find something pretty good if you're willing to forgo features like a touchscreen or a backlit keyboard, but you should try them out in person before buying if at all possible. That's because, by and large, the money savings come from cutting corners on the build quality and processor.\n\nBut if you\u2019re willing to spend more than that, you can generally get something fast and reliable if our main picks are unavailable or don\u2019t suit your needs.\n\nOur review of Google Pixelbook Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Beautiful, well-designed hardware\n\nGreat performance with Chrome apps\n\nThin and light Bad Stuff Battery life is only average\n\nTablet lacks features like split screen\n\nHigh price Buy for $999.00 from Amazon Buy for $999.00 from Google Store\n\nOur review of Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Small and portable\n\nIncluded stylus\n\nDecent performance Bad Stuff Keyboard not backlit\n\nAverage build quality\n\nAverage screen Buy for $599.99 from Best Buy Buy for $499.99 from Samsung\n\nOur review of Acer Chromebook Spin 13 (CP713) Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Big, beautiful screen with 4:3 aspect ratio\n\nBuilt-in stylus\n\nGood port selection Bad Stuff Oversized compared to competition\n\nFans spin up a lot\n\nPricey Buy for $684.99 from Amazon Buy for $699.99 from Acer", "description": "The best Chromebook will cost you a little more than it used to, but you\u2019ll get something that\u2019s competitive with Windows and Mac laptops in terms of hardware and features.
