But if people are taking them in high doses for a long time, that is usually a sign they are not working and those people need help to gradually come off them.\u2019\n\nOne recommendation of the PHE review was new guidelines for doctors on when they should intervene to help patients come off the drugs. Another was to set up a 24-hour advice helpline.\n\nIn the past year 11.5 million patients were given at least one prescription for opioid painkillers, antidepressants, sleeping pills or tranquillisers, a review by Public Health England (PHE) found (stock image)\n\nBut there are other, more radical ways to tackle the problem, according to a recent report by Dr Jessica Y. Ho, an assistant professor of gerontology and sociology at the University of Southern California.\n\nOne approach is specialist drug treatment centres. Developed initially for people addicted to illegal drugs, these can be \u2018very successful\u2019, says Dr Ho. But in the UK, the number of such centres has fallen since a decision in 2010 to hive them off from the NHS and make them the responsibility of local government.\n\nThis has been a disaster, according to Dr Stannard. \u2018With budget cuts of 40 per cent, the councils just can\u2019t afford to fund them and many have had to close,\u2019 she says. \u2018It\u2019s a false economy, as the costs of treating the effects of addiction are huge.\u2019\n\nIn the past, there have been no dedicated centres for those addicted to prescription drugs.\n\n\u2018The increased prescribing of these potentially addictive drugs shows the urgent need for [dedicated centres],\u2019 says Harry Shapiro, director of DrugWise, the information charity, who also sits on NHS and Parliamentary addiction advisory groups.\n\nThere is a huge demand for such centres. The UK Addiction Treatment Group (UKAT), a company that still provides addiction services for councils, is treating 45 per cent more people for prescription drug addiction than it was three years ago, according to Nuno Albuquerque, the head of its treatment programme.\n\nIn the UK, the number of over-65s taking antidepressants has more than doubled in two decades (stock image)\n\n\u2018GPs are already overstretched and most lack the resources and time to offer much more to these patients than repeat prescriptions,\u2019 he says.\n\nCentres can offer a more holistic approach \u2014 for instance, UKAT provides talking therapy, yoga, diet advice and acupuncture.\n\nDr Ho says the evidence supports greater use of non-drug treatments. In Portugal, she says, where people addicted to illegal drugs are offered free therapy, exercise and art under a treatment programme that also involves switching them to substitute medication, the number of addicts was halved in ten years.\n\nThe best way to wean patients off prescription drugs, an emerging consensus suggests, is gradually to reduce the dose \u2014 known as tapering \u2014 over months or even longer. But it can be difficult to make precise reductions when pills come in standard doses.\n\nAcknowledging this, a Dutch organisation has started marketing strips of very small doses of 24 prescription drugs.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an important option,\u2019 Dr Ho told Good Health, but added: \u2018It should involve your doctor to monitor you.\u2019\n\nAs for prevention, besides stricter guidelines for doctors, better information is needed about the drug combinations many patients take that can create new problems.\n\n\u2018Combining opioids with antidepressants increases patients\u2019 sensitivity to pain,\u2019 explains Harry Shapiro, \u2018which means they want higher doses, making it even harder to quit.\u2019", "description": "Specialist drug treatment centres are one way to tackle the problem of a 'hidden epidemic' of people dependent on prescription pills.
