From there, she headed to the United States, where she is also a citizen.\n\n\u201cI made it all the way to the biometrics, the fingerprint. The guy looked at the screen, then looked at me and pushed a button. And I knew that was it,\u201d Sochua said in an interview with Al Jazeera.\n\nSochua said the immigration officials who detained her were \u201cextremely polite\u201d.\n\nThai immigration authorities did not respond to requests for comment, but a document viewed by Al Jazeera showed that Sochua was rejected for \u201chaving behaviour which (was) possibly harmful\u201d to Thai society.\n\nCNRP President Kem Sokha was arrested for treasonin September 2017, and Sochua fled the country the following month. By November the party was dissolved entirely, allowing long-time Prime Minister Hun Sen to claim all 125 parliament seats in last year\u2019s election.\n\nSochua and CNRP co-founder Sam Rainsy - who has remained abroad since 2015 to avoid charges - pledged to return to Cambodia by land on November 9. They said they would rally thousands of supportive Cambodian migrant workers to come from Thailand with them.\n\nIt is the third time this year Rainsy has set a deadline for his return, and the government has responded by arresting dozens of supporters across the country, accusing them of plotting a coup. Hun Sen has also threatened to deploy the armed forces.\n\n'Thai wall'\n\nA spokesman for Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told pro-government media Sochua was \u201cblacklisted\u201d from Thailand after the Cambodian government claimed it would issue arrest warrants to all ASEAN countries.\n\nVeteran political analyst Lao Mong Hay said that with Sochua denied entry, Rainsy risked arrest and extradition if he tried to enter Thailand.\n\nMong Hay said Rainsy\u2019s pledge to involve Thai-based migrant workers may have forced the Thai government\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cHun Sen would be satisfied by that much cooperation from Thailand while it can ensure no disruption to Cambodian labour employed in its economy,\u201d Mong Hay said.\n\n\u201cBy refusing her entry but not arresting her, Thailand is trying to avoid getting in the middle of this dispute, and telling the Cambodians to take their political problems somewhere else\" says @hrw about refusal to allow @sochua_mu to enter country. https://t.co/4NmA0Oy1kD \u2014 Phil Robertson (@Reaproy) October 23, 2019\n\nHowever, Mong Hay said Rainsy\u2019s inability to enter the country could actually help him.\n\n\u201cThat Thai wall obstructing his return could enhance further Sam Rainsy's stature and popularity just as Iranian political and cleric Ayatollah Khomeni gained while in exile in France before returning triumphantly in 1979,\u201d Mong Hay said, adding that Rainsy remained a \u201cphenomenon\u201d and a \u201cforce to reckon with\u201d for Hun Sen.\n\nEar Sophal, a Cambodian-American associate professor of diplomacy and world affairs at Occidental College, agreed that any reputational damage to Rainsy would be minimised if he genuinely tried to return.\n\n\"He's got to get close and he gets an A for effort at least,\u201d Sophal said via email.\n\nSome are not so less generous.\n\nKem Sokha\u2019s own daughter has slammed the planned return as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d and a \u201cgimmick\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no real plan for any senior CNRP official to return to Cambodia on November 9,\u201d Kem Monovithya, also a party official, told local media.\n\nCambodian police officers stand guard near the National Assembly ahead of the official opening session of parliament after controversial elections in which the opposition party was banned. Hun Sen has resumed a crackdown on critics. [Mak Remissa/EPA]\n\n'Not over yet'\n\nWhether the desire is genuine or not, the journey is looking increasingly difficult.\n\nSophal said entering through Laos or Vietnam was \u201cnot really\u201d an option, but said Rainsy and Sochua could potentially return by air, from South Korea.\n\nThe CNRP, however, has long insisted the senior politicians will cross by land.\n\nWhile Sochua pointed out she has been granted entry to Thailand \u201cmany, many, many times\u201d in the past, Sophal said the situation appeared to have changed.\n\n\u201cThailand cooperated because they don't want trouble from Hun Sen and they made the calculation that it's better to deny her entry, a US Citizen no less,\u201d Sophal said, adding that because the date of return is well-known and impending, Thailand was more cautious than in the past.\n\nBut Sochua said some party leaders were already in Thailand, and that she and Rainsy were committed to returning to Cambodia by land, through Thailand.\n\nThe issue is being discussed with Thai authorities \u201cthrough many channels,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe will still book our tickets to go through Thailand.
