(AP) - A state appeals court on Thursday temporarily blocked New York from enforcing a new prohibition on sales of flavored e-cigarettes after the vaping industry sued to block the ban.\n\nThe stay comes a day before the state planned to start enforcing 90-day emergency regulations banning the sale of most flavored electronic cigarettes. The decision also follows a state court\u2019s refusal last week to issue a temporary restraining order on the regulations approved in September by Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nNew York\u2019s prohibition covering flavored e-cigarettes and other vaping products except for menthol and tobacco flavors went into effect immediately. Retailers initially had two weeks to remove merchandise from store shelves.\n\nHealth officials issued the regulations in response to worries that vaping may cause illnesses and that its use is growing among teenagers. According to data from the state health department, use among high-school students increased from 10.5% in 2014 to 27.4% in 2018.\n\nCritics including the Vapor Technology Association argued the bans are governmental overreach that will hurt small businesses selling e-cigarettes and adult smokers who say flavors help them quit. Such opponents instead say states should address improper marketing to kids and follow New York\u2019s move to raise the statewide smoking age to 21.\n\n\u201cWe continue to stand ready to work with the State of New York and all interested stakeholders on the many real solutions that should be implemented to achieve the twin goals of restricting youth vaping, which already is illegal, and preserving flavored alternatives for adults desperately trying to quit smoking,\u201d said Tony Abboud, Executive Director of the Vapor Technology Association.\n\nBut supporters such as the American Cancer Society\u2019s advocacy group said they\u2019ll continue pushing for New York\u2019s ban on flavored e-cigarettes and for laws to make such restrictions permanent.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt it is an emergency,\u201d said the group\u2019s spokeswoman Julie Hart. \u201cWe have to act and do something because our kids are getting addicted to flavored products. The next step is all flavored tobacco.\u201d\n\nNew York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said the court\u2019s decision won\u2019t deter officials from addressing the \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the court\u2019s ruling temporarily delays our scheduled enforcement of this ban, it will not deter us from using every tool at our disposal to address this crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nGov. Cuomo recently said he would move to expand New York\u2019s flavor ban to include menthol, though the status of such a change is unclear.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more than 500 confirmed and probable cases of lung illnesses and nine deaths nationwide have been attributed to vaping.\n\nStates such as Michigan and Rhode Island have moved to ban flavored e-cigarettes. President Donald Trump has also proposed a federal ban .\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A state appeals court on Thursday temporarily blocked New York from enforcing a new prohibition on sales of flavored e-cigarettes after the vaping industry sued to block the ban.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Marina Villeneuve"], "top_image": ""}
