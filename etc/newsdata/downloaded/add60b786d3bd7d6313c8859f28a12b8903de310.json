If you can find it, try Spicewalla\u2019s chai masala, but if you want to make your own, mix 4 parts ground ginger, 3 parts cinnamon, 2 parts ground cloves, 2 parts ground cardamom and 1 part freshly ground black pepper.\n\nFor a special occasion, you can top the cake with cream cheese frosting, but it\u2019s perfect on its own as an elegant, understated tea cake.\n\nStorage: The cake can be stored at room temperature, tightly wrapped, for up to 4 days.\n\nWhere to Buy: Spicewalla chai masala is available online.", "description": "It's like a gussied-up applesauce cake.
