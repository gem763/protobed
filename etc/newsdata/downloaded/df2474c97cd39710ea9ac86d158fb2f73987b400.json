Jones notes that the popular hashtag #nomenmidterms was used in memes that were made to look like they came from Democrats, while they actually came from 4chan in an effort to sow division in the party.\n\nWhat's next? \"We're going to see a lot of references like that leading up to 2020,\" says Jones. \"Fringe campaigns to manipulate the popularity of certain Democrats over others will increase, especially now while there are so many Democratic candidates in the field.\" Jones cites the down-ranking of Elizabeth Warren's YouTube videos as an example of this.\n\nGo deeper: Andrew Yang wants the support of the pro-Trump internet. Now it's threatening to devour him, by Buzzfeed reporter Ryan Broderick.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to remove Richard Spencer and Joe Rogan as examples of far-right influencers.", "description": "Alt-right communities online are testing messages and memes that will resonate ahead of 2020", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/cI9je-j9luRRuea-s_2_LY01cLM=/0x0:3200x1800/1920x1080/2019/03/19/1552991881164.png", "published_at": "2019-03-19"}
