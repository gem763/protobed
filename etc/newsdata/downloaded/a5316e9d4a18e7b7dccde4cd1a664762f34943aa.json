REUTERS/Vincent Kessler\n\nIn an address in the European Parliament, Juncker said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told him on Monday that London still wanted a transition deal, but that he would leave with or without an accord on Oct. 31.\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers cheered and applauded in the Strasbourg chamber.\n\n\u201cThere is very little time left...The risk of a no-deal is very real,\u201d said Juncker, who met Johnson in Luxembourg on Monday.\n\nJuncker repeated his public message, saying London must present realistic proposals to replace the Irish backstop arrangement in their Britain-EU divorce agreement.\n\n\u201cI am not emotionally attached to the Irish backstop,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cI have asked the prime minister to make, in writing, alternatives,\u201d he said, calling it a safety net to avoid a divided Ireland after Brexit.\n\nHis pessimistic tone was echoed by Finland\u2019s minister for European affairs, Tytti Tuppurainen, who also spoke in the parliament, saying a no-deal Brexit \u201cis a quite likely outcome.\u201d Finland currently holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency.\n\nHowever, many EU lawmakers warned against a no-deal. The parliament is due to adopt a resolution later on Wednesday calling for Britain to be granted another extension to allow more time for London to agree the terms of its withdrawal.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said that a no-deal Brexit would also not resolve many of the issues around the rights of EU citizens, the Irish border and British obligations under the bloc\u2019s long-term budget.\n\n\u201cIf the United Kingdom leaves without a deal, all these questions will not disappear. They are still there,\u201d Barnier said.", "description": "A deal to ensure a smooth British exit from the European Union is still possible but the risk of a no-deal is also \"very real\", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431148241&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0GQ-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
