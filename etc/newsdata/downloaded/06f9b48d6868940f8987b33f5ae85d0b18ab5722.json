They will be in place for six months starting November 12.\n\nFollowing the migration crisis in 2015, checks were introduced around the \u00d8resund bridge to stop the flow of people into Sweden. But the system cost millions of euros to maintain and lengthened travel times between Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6. Some 70,000 people cross the \u00d8resund bridge daily, with travelers roughly equally split between road and rail.\n\nDenmark said it has notified the European Commission of the plans.\n\nH\u00e6kkerup said the reintroduction of controls on the Swedish border is designed to counter criminal gangs, which are thought to have been responsible for 13 attacks in recent months including an explosion at a tax office in Denmark and a double murder. \u201cThe terror threat to Denmark remains serious,\u201d the government said in its statement.\n\nThe region around the \u00d8resund bridge is home to around 4 million people. The plan will also strengthen police presence at the frontier.\n\nBoth Denmark and Sweden are members of the Schengen zone of borderless travel, but the rules do allow for temporary reintroduction of checks under certain circumstances.\n\nThe Danish government also announced it will extend existing border checks with Germany for a further six months from November.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Move to tackle organized crime will particularly affect travel between Copenhagen and\u00a0Malm\u00f6.", "authors": ["Joshua Posaner"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-503260494-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
