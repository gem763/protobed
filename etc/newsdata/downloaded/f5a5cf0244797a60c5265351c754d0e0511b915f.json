There was some intrigue as relationships that seemed to be on shaky ground got back on track.\n\nMaria and Caesar together again\n\nThe biggest surprise of the night was Caesar\u2019s decision to get back with Maria. His Ukrainian girlfriend had dumped him after he failed to pay for her flight to Mexico.\n\nAt the time Caesar had planned to propose to her. Fast forward to Sunday and we discover that Maria had contacted Caesar weeks after the breakup, apologizing to her ex-boyfriend and asking for a fresh start. She also wanted some money to pay for her outstanding bills. Caesar apparently forgave his repentant girlfriend sent close to $3,000 dollars, reports E-News. Caesar\u2019s friend Jeremy called him the most gullible person he had ever known.\n\nCaesar is now planning a trip to Cuba to meet with Maria when they will likely try to rekindle their relationship.\n\nOther couples on the show were slightly less dramatic. Rebecca and Zied appeared to be working out their issues. Rebecca explained to her love interest that her divorce was in its final stages. While Zied appeared more accepting of the situation this week, Rebecca still fears that he will leave her.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most.

TV Shows\n\nShe said she was willing to do anything to save their relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, Benjamin had a meeting with Akinyi\u2019s parents and they haggled over her dowry price. Benjamin\u2019s offer did not impress his girlfriend\u2019s parents and they wanted more. The two parties managed to reach an agreement. Benjamin will pay what he can manage and settle the rest in the future. Akinyi found out that he was yet to tell his parents about her and it probably shocked her. Their chemistry will be interesting to watch in the few remaining episodes.\n\nAvery and Omar relationship\n\nAvery and Omar continued to follow up on Omar\u2019s chances of obtaining a visa to the United States. They met with a lawyer who gave them some discouraging news about Omar\u2019s chances. The lawyer said that the travel ban in America applied to him and he would have to request a waiver. His other option, also per his lawyer, is to spend some time away from Avery in the hopes that the authorities would see that the couple is going through hardship being apart.\n\nTimothy and Jennifer got back on track. She agreed to wear Timothy\u2019s engagement ring, but on her middle finger. She still insists on getting her own ring from him. The couple did not get intimate despite their make-up which could be cause for concern, moving forward.\n\nDarcey and Tom also had a good moment after he finally said he loved her. He made a romantic gesture, although, it was not what Darcey expected.\n\nHe gave her the key to his apartment which, while is a sign of progress, fans surely know that what Darcey really wants is an engagement ring.\n\nFinally, Angela met with Michael\u2019s parents and they seem to accept her relationship with him. She had a sit down with Michael\u2019s mom but, rather than reveal the truth about her fertility situation, she told her that they would conceive in the near future. The show will return next week and fans should be looking forward to the fallout from this week\u2019s episode.
