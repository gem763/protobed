In the last year, 900 officers were hired.\n\nThe Government department said it is 'continually looking to improve our capability to respond to changing threats, to detect, deter and disrupt harm'.\n\nPurfleet shown in relation to Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays where the bodies were found\n\nOfficers can use carbon dioxide detectors, motion sensors and sniffer dogs to detect people hiding in lorries. Containers are identified at ports to be searched.\n\nWhen searching cars, officers may test surfaces for drug residue, check underneath the vehicle and manually search among luggage in the boot.\n\nDrivers and hauliers are told to 'operate effective security measures' to stop migrants hiding in their vehicles. If any are found, the drivers and companies can be fined.\n\nBut some lorry drivers have told of daily difficulties in trying to prevent their cargo being targeted, even when they have taken steps to secure their vehicles.\n\nThe driver of the truck in Grays, named locally as 25-year-old Mo Robinson, from Northern Ireland, was still in custody today after being held on suspicion of murder.\n\nLorries are pictured outside the Purfleet Thames Terminal in Essex on Wednesday afternoon\n\nPolice also said a man and a woman, both aged 38 and from Warrington, Cheshire, were arrested on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter and people trafficking.\n\nFormer Purfleet port security guard Gary Lilley, 61, has described how the area 'comes alive at night' with the arrival of trafficked migrants.\n\nMr Lilley, who lives opposite the port where he worked for six weeks in 2012, also claimed minibuses meet lorries to take away the migrants following their arrival.\n\nMr Lilley told The Times there is a 'notorious' lay-by near the port where migrants ditch their documents so UK authorities don't know where to repatriate them to.\n\nHe added: 'Minibuses wait there at night for them to arrive. Last summer during the heatwave I gave water bottles to two five-year-old girls as they looked desperate.\n\n'They were standing by the side of the road in a group of about 15. At the lay-by you see the lorries pull up and the migrants pop their heads out to see if it's safe.\n\nPolice drive the lorry along the road next to Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays on Wednesday\n\n'On many occasions I've seen minibuses pull up and they jump in and are driven off. It's so organised.'\n\nRichard Ballantyne, chief executive of the British Ports Association, said: 'We were horrified to see the events in Essex unfold and our thoughts are with the 39 victims and also the emergency services responding to the situation.\n\n'People traffickers have adapted their methods in recent years and ports have been working with the UK Border Force and the police to deal with these ever varying risks.\n\n'Ports and shipping companies are all subject to strict security standards set by the International Maritime Organisation. Individual UK port operators have close working relationships with the national security agencies and with local authorities.\n\n'These organisations have a strong presence at our borders and a close working relationship with ports with which they share intelligence.'\n\nVile slave trade of China's Snakeheads: PAUL BRACCHI reveals how brutal criminal gangs exploit the country's poor, shipping them across the world\n\nThere is a saying in China that, \u2018when one person goes abroad, the whole family makes money\u2019.\n\nMight this hold the key to the pitiful discovery inside a refrigerated lorry on an industrial park in Essex? It would seem so.\n\nThe 39 stowaways who died, it has now been confirmed, were not from Africa, the Middle East or Eastern Europe, as was initially suspected, but China.\n\nChina has undergone rapid economic growth since the 1980s, making it the second richest nation on earth after the U.S. \u2014 prosperity symbolised by the skyscrapers of Shanghai and the gleaming Bird\u2019s Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing, images we have all seen countless times on TV.\n\nBut, outside the big cities, many Chinese (more than 30 million, according to Forbes magazines) live in abject poverty.\n\nThe majority of the disadvantaged and dispossessed live in the country on farmland which is sometimes little more than semi-desert and in homes which can often be found carved into the mountainside.\n\nOthers are crammed into suburban slums. And the gap between rich and poor is widening, fuelled, in part, by the continuing trade war with the U.S. which has forced many factories to close, disproportionately punishing some of the least well-off in society.\n\nSurveys have repeatedly found that even those from China\u2019s upper and middle class are eager to leave the mainland, citing concerns about the lack of high-quality schooling and health care, and lingering pollution and food safety problems.\n\nThe truth is that a growing number of Chinese dream of leaving their homeland in search of a better life in the West, especially Britain where there is already a large Chinese community.\n\nThe 39 stowaways who died, it has now been confirmed, were not from Africa, the Middle East or Eastern Europe, as was initially suspected, but China\n\nOfficially, there are 207,000 Chinese-born UK citizens, the tenth biggest group of overseas-born residents.\n\nChinese nationals made 1,139 asylum applications in the year ending June 2019 \u2014 up 16 per cent from the 2018 total, the highest number of asylum applications over the past decade. The unofficial total, though, could be significantly higher.\n\nThey disappear into the black market, working in restaurant kitchens, as agricultural labour or even cannabis farms. Women are often set up in nail salons or forced to work in brothels.\n\nThe terrible events of the past few days are but the latest example of the trade in \u2018human cargo\u2019 between China and Britain, a 5,000-mile route through Asia and mainland Europe that can take a month.\n\nTwo previous tragedies provide clues into the harrowing story which may yet lay behind the deaths of the latest victims.\n\nIn 2000, the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a sealed, airless container at Dover port. Post-mortems confirmed their deaths were due to asphyxiation.\n\nPerry Wacker, a Dutch lorry driver, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter of the immigrants who had paid a criminal gang thousands of pounds to be smuggled into the UK.\n\nThe inquest heard Wacker had closed a vent at the side of the container as the lorry went onto a ferry, fearing they\u2019d be heard.\n\nFour years later, 23 Chinese cocklepickers drowned after their ruthless gangmaster abandoned them on treacherous sands in Morecambe Bay.\n\nTheir recruiter, Lin Liang Ren, who was based here, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter at Preston Crown Court.\n\nIn 2000, the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a sealed, airless container at Dover port. Post-mortems confirmed their deaths were due to asphyxiation. Perry Wacker, a Dutch lorry driver, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter of the immigrants who had paid a criminal gang thousands of pounds to be smuggled into the UK\n\nBoth Dover and Morecambe Bay have at least one other thing in common: Fujian province. All those who died came from this region of south-eastern China, situated opposite the island of Taiwan.\n\nFujian is also the \u2018home\u2019 of the notorious Snakeheads, an off-shoot of the Triads.\n\nThe Snakeheads, who specialise in people smuggling, are so-called because those who wish to get out of China illegally need guidance as they \u2018twist and turn\u2019 to find ways around border controls \u2014 \u2018a sophisticated travel service in human misery,\u2019 they have been labelled.\n\nBack in the 1990s, their activities were focused on Hong Kong, providing black market labour mostly to the kitchens of restaurants run by Hong Kong\u2019s long-established Chinese community.\n\nIn the intervening years, the Snakeheads have branched out supplying young women, who are often kidnapped and forced into the sex trade in Britain.\n\nSome, as young as 11, have arrived in this country without passports or visas and claim asylum. Once here, they vanish from hostels or foster care to which they have been assigned by the immigration authorities.\n\nHome Office statistics show 3,641 women entered immigration detention in 2018 \u2014 with 420 of these being Chinese.\n\nThe latest annual statistics from the National Crime Agency (NCA) show the number of Chinese people reported to the National Referral Mechanism, which assesses instances of modern slavery, has increased by more than 50 per cent from 293 in 2017 to 451 in 2018.\n\nBetween January to March this year, another 131 Chinese slaves were referred for help, half of whom had been found by UK Border Force or immigration enforcement teams, and other victims were reported to police in the West Midlands, Gloucestershire, Cambridgeshire and London.\n\nWhen the NCA launched a Europe-wide operation targeting slavery and human trafficking in June, there were more Chinese victims found in the UK than almost any other nationality, representing more than a fifth of the 35 victims identified at that time.\n\nFour years later, 23 Chinese cocklepickers drowned after their ruthless gangmaster abandoned them on treacherous sands in Morecambe Bay. Their recruiter, Lin Liang Ren, who was based here, was jailed for 14 years for manslaughter at Preston Crown Court\n\nThe Snakeheads, of course, also target economic migrants. They were linked to the Dover tragedy, the worst such incident of its kind in Britain which has chilling parallels with the latest discovery at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex. The lorries in both cases entered the country from Zeebrugge in Belgium.\n\nLondon lawyer Tan Wah Piow has acted for around 6,000 asylum seekers from China since the 1990s,\n\nThe majority came from Fujian province. It is where, he said, the saying \u2014 \u2018when one person goes abroad, the whole family make money\u2019 \u2014 originates.\n\n\u2018For there to be a group of 39 in a container, they are most likely from Fujian, maybe even from the same place in Fujian,\u2019 he told the Mail. \u2018Fujian is prosperous nowadays and part of that prosperity is down to the remittances from relatives abroad.\n\n\u2018In Fujian there is a history of getting on in life by going abroad and sending money back. The majority of Chinese arriving since the Nineties, discounting students, are from Fujian. The UK still attracts people from the province.\u2019\n\nPoor people, he said, have the same concerns, but less opportunity to emigrate. The Chinese government controls who can get a passport and who qualifies for an exit permit.\n\n\u2018The people in containers will be the poor who are unable to get visas to come to work and live in the UK, and so they have resorted to paying people smugglers,\u2019 said Tan.\n\nBernie Gravett, a former police superintendent and an international expert in human trafficking crime says it is unlikely the victims asked to be trafficked.\n\nHe said: \u2018They will have been approached originally by the criminals in south China, where millions live in the direst poverty.\n\n\u2018The salesmen for the gangs will have promised that lucrative jobs were waiting in the West, and that migrants would be able to send money home to their families, and return to China when they wanted.\n\n\u2018A high price is usually stipulated in advance: the migrants would face charges of, on average, \u00a350,000. But they would be promised a chance to pay this off in instalments, out of their wages. The victims are being cheated and deceived, but it is rare to talk to any who were kidnapped or sold into slavery from the outset.\n\n\u2018Once the journey begins, so does the brutality. When victims start to complain at their conditions, perhaps asking for food, they will be beaten. Sometimes one will be maimed or killed, to frighten the others into submission.\u2019\n\nThe brutality and desperation of the victims chimes with the findings of the Chinese In Britain Forum charity.\n\nChina has undergone rapid economic growth since the 1980s, making it the second richest nation on earth after the U.S. \u2014 prosperity symbolised by the skyscrapers of Shanghai and the gleaming Bird\u2019s Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing\n\nIn 2009, it interviewed 177 Chinese migrants living in London, many of them undocumented, about why they came to Britain.\n\nThose who took part revealed heart-breaking stories of being smuggled into the UK to escape persecution or because of aspirations to the \u2018good life\u2019 imagined within these shores.\n\n\u2018In China, it is hard to find work and wages are low,\u2019 said one. \u2018If you had a family you can\u2019t support them. It may not even be enough for your own spending. The cost of living is particularly high. The money you earn may not even be enough for food and drink.\u2019\n\nDescriptions of corrupt officials and enforcement of the one-child policy were commonplace.\n\n\u2018We were subjected to persecution,\u2019 said another who was interviewed. \u2018When my wife was thinking of having a second baby she was sent to prison and was fined.\n\n\u2018I came here because I wanted to be able to feed my family and have a reasonable standard of living. But when I arrived here what I saw was totally different to what I had imagined. Life was hard for me.\u2019\n\nA third Chinese resident, called Wang Wei, smuggled into the UK via Dover, gave the following harrowing account of his journey.\n\n\u2018They [the criminal gang] put me inside a container and said we will take you to a safe place. Well, it took more than a month, more than 40 days. All inside the container. I didn\u2019t know where I was. I guess I was on the sea. I only noticed the container was loaded and unloaded.\n\n\u2018They got food for me. You pee inside as well . . . inside the container for more than 40 days. I paid them more than \u00a315,000.\u2019\n\nIt is hard not to believe that the reason for the latest tragedy lies somewhere in these pitiful testimonies.\n\nAdditional reporting Tim Stewart", "description": "The National Crime Agency warned ministers three years ago that criminals are now targeting ports along the UK's eastern and southern coasts in addition to Dover.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20184852-0-image-a-131_1572015013021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
