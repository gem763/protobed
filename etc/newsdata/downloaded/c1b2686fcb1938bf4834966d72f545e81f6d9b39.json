He was granted asylum by Ecuador and lived on the property for nearly seven years prior to being punted in April and promptly arrested. He was subsequently charged by the Department of Justice with crimes related to WikiLeaks and is currently fighting a U.S. extradition request while behind bars in a London prison.\n\nIn a press release, Spain\u2019s National Court said it is investigating a complaint brought on behalf of Mr. Assange that alleges the security firm installed hidden microphones and other devices within the embassy which recorded information later passed along to the Ecuadorian and U.S. governments.\n\nSpanish newspaper El Pais reported Wednesday that Mr. Morales was quietly arrested in southern Spain last month and released on bail. Authorities began investigating him and his company after El Pais revealed in June the existence of audio and video recordings from within the embassy of Mr. Assange and his meetings with attorneys and other visitors, the paper reported.\n\nA message requesting comment from Undercover Global was not immediately answered.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged Mr. Assange was crimes including multiple violations of the U.S. Espionage Act related to his solicitation and publication of sensitive military and diplomatic documents dating back to 2010. He has argued he acted as a journalist and is fighting extradition.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
