That's when you realise life has an end and people start telling you you have to grow up.\n\n\"I never lost my happiness. As an adult people just call you crazy. People assume you're taking something or drunk.\"\n\nShonette, who has four grown-up children and lives in Teeside, started travelling around the country to different schools after coming up with Dough Disco, a children's activity which aims to develop fine muscle control using play dough with a series of finger and hand exercises.\n\n\"I've always thought that a teacher has the ability to impact a larger number of people than most people in the world.\n\n\"A teacher has the potential to impact on 30 children. If they go home happy, they impact their family and then the wider community.\n\n\"I want to be the teacher that inspires children. That's what I thought every teacher would be, but when I started meeting other teachers I discovered there are lemon suckers.\n\n(Image: Shonette Bason-Wood)\n\n\"They are everywhere. No child should be taught by a lemon sucker.\"\n\nSo she now gives talks and holds sessions in schools, organisations and businesses, including the NHS, teaching people to power of happiness.\n\nShe said: \"People think that happiness is unicorns and glitter but it's not.\n\n\"You've got to constantly think it.\n\n\"Everyone has days where they wake up in a bad mood. It's your choice from that moment on how you impact others.\n\n\"People who are happy have to apologise for being happy in the workplace .\n\n\"But when you're happy at work you're 22 per cent more productive.\n\n(Image: Shonette Bason-Wood)\n\n\"My mission is to help people as being happy is a nicer place to be. It is so simple to be happier.\n\n\"One of the biggest things that I say to people is kindness. Things like complimenting people.\"\n\nShonette admits she's been through some very low points in her life, and says she definitely isn't always her normal happy self.\n\n\"It does make you stronger. It doesn't feel like it in the middle of something, but you get to the other side. As you get older it happens quicker.\n\n\"I always say to my children, you have to remember everything will always work out for you.\"\n\nIn the past five weeks she has nearly died twice after complications from a kidney infection left her in a coma and needing a blood transfusion.\n\n\"Sometimes in life, it just throws you a curve ball. Just because you're happy doesn't mean everything works out for you.\"\n\n(Image: Shonette Bason-Wood)\n\nAnd Shonette's positive attitude doesn't appeal to everyone and she believes it may be partly to blame for her two divorces.\n\n\"I think I'm probably a bit annoying to be with. I don't wake up whinging about Mondays.\"\n\nShonette's advice to anyone who wants to start the day on a positive is to have a personal anthem ready to hit play on every morning.\n\nEven when she was really poorly earlier this month, Shonette would put on Chuck Berry and imagine herself dancing around her kitchen with an air guitar.\n\n\"When you wake up and you're not feeling it or you've got meetings in the day you're dreading, you just put on your personal anthem .\n\n\"It's a bit like being Rocky. Mine is Pete Tong's Galvanize.\n\n\"Put the music on in the car and by the time you get to work you're pumped up.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE Shonette\u00a0Bason-Wood thought every teacher wanted to inspire their kids, but visiting schools around the country made her realise that wasn't the case - so she decided to do something about it", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Shonette Bason-Wood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20590624.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_UKs-happiest-person-explains-why-she-wont-let-divorce-and-terrifying-illness-get-her-down-Shon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
