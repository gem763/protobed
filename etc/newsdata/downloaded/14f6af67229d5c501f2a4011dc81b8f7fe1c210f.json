They\u2019re vulnerable in some fashion. But there are people whose livelihoods don\u2019t depend on this.\n\n\u201cThere are people, for example, who are no longer running for reelection in Congress. There are people who are independently wealthy. There are people who can just go back to the private sector,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cInstead of making all these political calculations, although I think the calculation they should be making is he\u2019s going to be gone at some point and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning and history isn\u2019t going to be kind to people who said nothing or stood up for Trump,\u201d he added.\n\nCheck out the full interview below. Conway\u2019s comments on the trap door begin at the 50-minute mark.", "description": "Kellyanne Conway's husband also tore into the people who remain silent on Trump in a wide-ranging new interview.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6a36ef3b00004e00cabeaa.jpeg?cache=jthjhkq667&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
