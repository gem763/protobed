The Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers were killed in a car bomb in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh in August 1972.\n\nDowney appeared this morning at Omagh Magistrates' Court having failed in attempts to prevent his extradition from the Irish Republic.\n\nJohn Downey, 67, has appeared in court in Omagh, Co Tyrone today in connection with the murder of part-time British soldiers Lance Corporal Alfred Johnson and Private James Eames in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh in August 1972\n\nDowney, from County Donegal, was extradited from the Irish Republic on foot of a European Arrest Warrant\n\nDowney is accused of the murder of Lance Corporal Alfred Johnson, 32, left, and Private James Eames, 33, right\n\nHe had previously been charged with the 1982 Hyde Park bombing which led to the murder of four members of the Household Cavalry.\n\nHis Old Bailey trial collapsed in 2014 after it emerged he had a letter from former Prime Minister Tony Blair\n\nThe Donegal man was arrested by Gardai on foot of a European Arrest Warrant on November 5, 2018.\n\nDowney handed himself in to Letterkenny Garda Station on Friday after he lost an appeal to challenge his extradition in July this year.\n\nDressed in a white shirt and blue jumper, Downey appeared in the dock flanked by a police officer, while his family sat in court and gestured to him.\n\nPSNI Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell told the court: 'Police object to bail for the defendant on the grounds that he is a flight risk.\n\n'The defendant did not consent to be extradited and appealed to High Court in Dublin.'\n\nMr Caldwell went on to list the number of hearings Downey had gone through to fight extradition in the Republic of Ireland, before stating: 'In light of all of this, police are of the view the defendant doesn't want to face trial in Northern Ireland.'\n\nSamuel Magee QC, for the prosecution, said Brexit could also pose a challenge in the case.\n\nHe told the court: 'Mr Downey has challenged extradition all the way.\n\n'In police custody last night we got the defendant's passport which he brought with him, however he could easily leave and go to the Republic and with all the uncertainty around Brexit, that could frustrate the justice process.'\n\nBut Downey's barrister Michael Duffy said the accused is not a flight risk as he has nowhere else to go.\n\nA PSNI officer told Omagh Magistrates' Court the force objected to Downey receiving bail as they considered him to be a 'flight risk'\n\nDowney, pictured today being led into court, handed himself into Gardai in the Irish Republic last night who handed him over to the PSNI\n\nDowney stood trial in 2013 over the Hyde Park bombing in 1982 but his trial later collapsed in controversy\n\nHe told the court: 'First of all, this is a 67-year-old man, he's married with children, there are no issues in relation to this man not complying with all conditions.\n\n'There's nowhere this man can go, his family are grounded where he lives, and has lived all his married life, he is a man of ill health with chronic conditions, and that should be taken into consideration.\n\n'There is no evidence the accused has committed any actual act in the 47 years since the alleged crime.'\n\nMr Duffy added that by appealing against his extradition, Downey was justifiably engaging with the legal process.\n\nMr Ranaghan agreed, adding: 'Human rights are there for a reason.'\n\nMr Duffy concluded any trial would be a lengthy and complicated one, adding it would be an 'affront to justice' not to grant bail.\n\nMr Ranaghan took a recess in his chamber for several minutes before making his decision, and then said: 'This is far from straightforward.\n\n'There are a number of matters that point toward granting bail, I have considered Mr Downey's age and health, and the strength of the evidence.\n\n'This will be a long and protracted matter with numerous pretrial issues.\n\n'On the other side of the coin, the charge couldn't be more grave.\n\n'I am conducting a risk assessment here in the circumstances, and I find he is a flight risk, and so I do refuse bail.\n\nHe told Downey he has the right to appeal against that decision.\n\nA large crowd had gathered outside the town centre court house in support of Downey, including Sinn Fein MP for the area Orfhlaith Begley and a number of former and current Sinn Fein representatives including ex-MP Pat Doherty.\n\nThe blast killed four Royal Household Cavalrymen but it was revealed Downey had received a written assurance from government that he was not actively wanted by the authorities\n\nThe flag-draped coffin carrying Lt Anthony Daly, the Blues and Royals officer, who was killed in the Hyde Park bombing\n\nAfter the hearing, Downey was transferred from the court to a waiting police van.\n\nCrowds shouted support for the accused, before a scuffle ensued between them and police officers after PSNI had attempted to move supporters and the press from the road.\n\nDowney was arrested at his home in Donegal in October last year under a European Arrest Warrant after authorities in Northern Ireland determined they had sufficient evidence to charge him with the murders of Mr Johnston, 32, and Mr Eames, 33.\n\nIn 2013, Downey was charged with murdering four Royal Household Cavalrymen in a bomb attack in London's Hyde Park in 1982.\n\nHe was tried at the Old Bailey in 2014 but the case dramatically collapsed after it was revealed he had received a written assurance from former prime minister Tony Blair's government that he was not actively wanted by the authorities.\n\nThe letter was allegedly issued under the terms of the controversial On The Runs (OTRs) scheme.", "description": "John Downey, 67, has appeared in court in Omagh, Co Tyrone today in connection with the
