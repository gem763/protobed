Look around us. They\u2019re clean. They\u2019re high tech. They are very much the industries of the future,\" she said.\n\nShe reported that as part of her \"Pledge to America's Workers\" initiative, the administration was able to see 300 private sector companies commit to training American workers.\n\n\"This economy, because of the policy and because of the environment that\u2019s been created through tax reform and deregulation that has unleashed business and unleashed investment in this country,\" she said.\n\nTrump added that the administration was working to craft agreements that would make occupational licensing simpler, an issue that particularly affects military families who frequently move. \"So we're thinking about compacts.
