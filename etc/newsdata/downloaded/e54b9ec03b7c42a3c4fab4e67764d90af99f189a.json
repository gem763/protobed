Most other ads listed under the company's LinkedIn page promote the company's co-working space in multiple languages, given WeWork's presence in 29 countries.\n\nRead more: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann's WeWork talk about the nonstop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nThe promoted ad advising on \"lagging company morale\" comes as many WeWork employees have called out the startup's chaotic work culture. Business Insider reached out to WeWork for comment.\n\nFormer and current employees \u2014 from cleaners to higher-up managers \u2014 spoke of the company's tequila-fueled party culture and long work days. Employees told Business Insider's Julie Bort and Meghan Morris of alleged sexual harassment from company executives, resulting in at least one employee lawsuit for gender discrimination.\n\nOther WeWork employees spoke of the \"truly, truly insane\" company turnover. Three former employees said every new month they received a new manager.\n\nThe company's reputation has soured employees so much, many worry having WeWork on their resume is a \"black mark against them.\"\n\nThe WeWork posted their ad on lagging team morale to LinkedIn two weeks ago, following its botched IPO filing and around the time news reports began detailing the CEO Adam Neumann's idiosyncratic management style.\n\nEven before the recent company controversy, at least two Twitter users complained of seeing too many WeWork sponsored ads on LinkedIn:\n\n\"Every day I report to LinkedIn that I do not want to see another ad about WeWork, and the next day, if not the next hour, I am bombarded with WeWork sponsored posts again,\" Eric Di Benedetto, a private investor, tweeted in January. \"What a stupid use of VC money!!!\" (Di Benedetto declined to comment for this article).\n\n\u2014Eric Di Benedetto (@ericdibenedetto) January 19, 2019\n\n\"Hey @WeWork. Ever hear of frequency capping? Your starting to SPAM your best source of leads with @LinkedIn ads,\" Troy Norcross tweeted in 2016.\n\nOn its website, LinkedIn states its sponsored ads are meant to target specific audiences on the site to promote a business or product. LinkedIn states its audience has double the amount of buying power as the average web audience, presumably given the white-collar professionals that use the service.\n\nThe cost of putting ads on LinkedIn depend on how much engagement your ads get and which audiences you want to target. Companies \"bid\" to put ads on the site in an auction where the highest offer gets to place their content.\n\nPer its advertising policy, LinkedIn will remove ads that are \"offensive to good taste,\" meaning hateful, vulgar, sexual, or violent. Posts that are initially approved can be later taken down as LinkedIn \"updates its policies to reflect new laws.\"", "description": "The promoted ad advising on \"lagging company morale\" comes as many WeWork employees have called out the startup's chaotic work culture.", "authors": ["Allana Akhtar"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e18773b33a75a417b30f2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
