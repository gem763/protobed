Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, calls for earnings of $2.71 a share.\n\nRevenue: Wall Street expects revenue of $18.22 billion from IBM, according to 16 analysts polled by FactSet. That\u2019s slightly down from the $18.25 billion forecast at the beginning of the quarter and the $18.76 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. Estimize expects revenue of $18.31 billion.\n\nIn addition to GTS revenue, analysts expect cloud and cognitive services revenue of $5.44 billion from IBM, along with global business services revenue of $4.12 billion, and systems revenue of $1.52 billion.\n\nThe only major segment expected to grow from the year-ago period is cloud and cognitive services with a 31% gain.\n\nStock movement: IBM shares have declined 0.2% since the company\u2019s last earnings report. In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.21% declined 1.5%, the S&P 500 SPX, +1.09% has slipped 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.34% has declined 1.6%.\n\nWhat analysts are saying: Of the 22 analysts who cover IBM, seven have buy or overweight ratings, 13 have hold ratings and two have sell or underweight ratings, with an average price target of $153.79, or 7.7% higher than Friday\u2019s close.", "description": "International Business Machines Corp. short-term stock performance will likely depend on the company\u2019s global technology services business even though much...", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS186_ibm_bl_ZG_20190927064552.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
