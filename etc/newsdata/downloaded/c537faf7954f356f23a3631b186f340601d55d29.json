This helped fuel a strong three months for the pharmaceutical company, which saw core operating income grow by 18 percent as well as net income from continuing operations up by 12 percent.\n\nZolgensma treats SMA, which is \u201ca genetic disease affecting the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, and voluntary muscle movement.\u201d It is one dose and designed for those under the age of two years old.\n\nAs Novartis notes, the hefty price tag over $2 million per patient is still less than other traditional treatments.\n\n\u201cThe current 10-year cost of chronic therapy, which is given over the patient's lifetime, can often exceed USD 4 million in just the first 10 years of a young child's life,\u201d Novartis noted in the May announcement of the drug.\n\n\u201cIn addition, that therapy stops working if treatment is stopped. Zolgensma is expected to save costs in the healthcare system compared to chronic treatment for the treatment and care of SMA.\u201d\n\nStocks in this Article NVS NOVARTIS AG $86.92 +0.36 (+0.42%)\n\nCritics railed about the price, even as those suffering from SMA said it was worthwhile. There were also concerns about the rollout and testing prior to release, with Novartis embroiled in a controversy about the \u201cdata manipulation in a specific animal testing procedure used in the development of the product.\u201d\n\nNet sales for Novartis for the third quarter check in at $12.2 billion, up 10 percent. Zolgensma\u2019s strong debut beat predictions of $98 million for the quarter and the growth appears likely to continue.\n\n\u201cZolgensma has been used to treat patients ranging in age from less than one month to two years old including all types of SMA,\u201d the Novartis release said. \u201cTo date plans are in place covering ~90% of commercial patients and ~30% of Medicaid patients.\u201d\n\nThe news from Novartis, which also detailed the strong clinical backing of Zolgensma, also outlined that the drug is under review in both Europe and Japan. Decisions on approval from both fronts are expected next year.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Zolgensma, the world's most expensive drug, beat sales expectations in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/novartis.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
