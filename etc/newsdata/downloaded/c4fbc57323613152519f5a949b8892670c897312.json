The remarkable installation organized by the Swiss curator Klaus Littmann is the realization of a long-held dream based on an artist's drawing he saw more than three decades ago.\n\nLittmann confesses that Max Peintner sounded skeptical that his vision, which he created in 1970, could be ever be realized. But the Basel-born curator, who studied with Joseph Beuys, will unveil the meticulously planned art project in the city of Klagenfurt in southern Austria on September 8. Called For Forest- The Unending Attraction of Nature, it has transformed the W\u00f6rthersee soccer stadium into a temporary forest of trees native to Austria and Central Europe.\n\nRead more: An Australian sports journalist was accidentally charged $100,000 for a bottle of beer during a work trip to England, and he won't get his money back for over a week\n\nThe curator has transplanted hundreds of specimens, some of them fully grown and weighing up to six tonnes each, to create the living work of art inspired by Peintner's work, which predates Beuys's proposal to plant 7,000 oak trees at documenta in Kassel in 1982.\n\nThe installation in Austria took a total of 22 days to execute, with diverse species like alder, aspen, field maple, and common oak being sourced from nurseries in Italy, Germany, and Belgium. The team, which was overseen by the firm Enea Landscape Architecture, opted to source from three locations to minimize the number of journeys involved in moving the plants to Austria.\n\nEach will be transplanted again at the end of October after For Forest closes. Mindful of the ecological footprint of the project, the curator explains that they will be moved to a site near the stadium.\n\nThe exhibition, titled For Forest \u2013 The Unending Attraction of Nature, is open until the end of October.

Littmann's version of his drawing opens as this year's Venice Biennale's Golden Lion-winning Lithuanian Pavilion also raises awareness about climate change. The operatic installation features an indoor beach.\n\nRead more: The Brooklyn Nets' Spencer Dinwiddie may have just dropped over $3 million on the highest penthouse in Brooklyn \u2014 here's a look inside\n\nWith forest fires raging in the Amazon, and Hurricane Dorian causing devastation in the Bahamas, the experience of nature contained inside the man-made structure of the soccer stadium seems set to also strike an emotional chord among spectators. The audience will be able to view the forest from many different angles within the 30,000-seat stadium. The ephemeral work will continually change as leaves on the tree change color and drop during the fall.\n\n\"With this art intervention I would like to challenge our perception of nature and sharpen our awareness of the future relationship between nature and humankind,\" the curator says. \"This project is also a warning,\" he adds: \"Nature, which we now take for granted, might someday only be found in specially assigned spaces, as is already the case with zoo animals.\"\n\nKlauss Littmann.

There will also be a group show called \"Touch Wood\" at the Museum of Modern Art in Carinthia and at the Stadtgalerie Klagenfurt, which explore the theme of forests.\n\n\"FOR FOREST\" will be on view at W\u00f6rthersee Stadion from September 8 through October 27, Klagenfurt.\n\nRead more:\n\nDana White barred BJ Penn from fighting in the UFC after recent footage showed him getting in a street fight\n\nRaiders plan to suspend Antonio Brown after he got into a screaming match with the GM and threatened to hit him in the face\n\nCristiano Ronaldo once dreamed of being the world's best soccer player.
