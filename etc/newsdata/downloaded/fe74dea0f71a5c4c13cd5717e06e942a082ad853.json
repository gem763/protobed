Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine policy expert for the National Security Council, is set to testify before the House intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees to answer questions about whether Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations involving Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nVindman monitored the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which resulted in a whistle-blower complaint that has sparked a Trump impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman writes in prepared remarks obtained by Politico and ABC News.\n\nVindman is the first White House official to testify in the impeachment proceedings. The Trump administration has made efforts to block other officials from giving depositions.\n\n\u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and [gas company] Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play, which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\u201d Vindman\u2019s statemen reads.\n\n\u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security,\u201d he added. \u201cFollowing the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\u201d\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony follows that of other key witnesses, including U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. In his remarks, Vindman said Sondland had stressed to him the importance of Ukraine\u2019s cooperation, and that he\u2019d been supported by former national security officer Fiona Hill.\n\n\u201cI stated to Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cFollowing the debriefing meeting, I reported my concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel. Dr. Hill also reported the incident to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\u201d\n\nVindman said in his statement that he worried the dealings would undermine U.S. interests in eastern Europe.\n\nHe said he decided to testify out of a \u201csense of duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d Vindman wrote. \u201cFor over 20 years, as an active duty United States military officer and diplomat, I have served this country in a nonpartisan manner and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both Republican and Democratic administrations.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 A top White House official is expected to testify Tuesday that President Donald Trump undermined national security by pressuring the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
