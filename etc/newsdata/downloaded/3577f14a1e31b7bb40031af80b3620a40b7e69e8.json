The result is clear: the allegations are groundless,\" the German company said in a statement to Bloomberg.\n\nLawyers for both Mr Winterkorn and Mr P\u00f6tsch have said the two men are blameless, while Mr Diess's lawyer said the current CEO did not join Volkswagen until July 2015 and would have had no idea about the breadth of the scandal.\n\nSecond indictment\n\nThe Volkswagen scandal erupted in September 2015, when the company admitted that nearly 600,000 cars sold in the US were fitted with \"defeat devices\" designed to circumvent emissions tests. Millions more across the world were also fitted with the device from 2009 through to 2015.\n\nMr Winterkorn, the CEO at the time, stepped down from the firm after the scandal broke, and Mr Diess took over as head.\n\nThis is the second indictment by prosecutors in relation to the diesel scandal.\n\nMr Winterkorn and three other VW managers were charged with fraud in April.\n\nIn a statement on that case, prosecutors accused Mr Winterkorn of a \"particularly serious\" fraud, as well as a breach of competition laws.\n\nThey said that the former CEO should have alerted car owners and authorities in Europe and the US about the manipulation of diesel emissions tests sooner.\n\nThey also accused him of approving a \"useless\" software update designed to conceal the true reason for the cars' higher emission levels.\n\nThis came after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Volkswagen and Mr Winterkorn a month earlier.\n\nThe SEC claimed the firm misled investors by issuing billions of dollars worth of bonds and securities, without disclosing that it had cheated emissions tests.\n\nThe company responded by saying it would contest the SEC lawsuit vigorously.", "description": "Three current and former executives are charged in relation to a diesel emissions scandal from 2015.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/611E/production/_108926842_vwboss.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
