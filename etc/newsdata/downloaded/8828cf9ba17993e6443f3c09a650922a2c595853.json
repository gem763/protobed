Amid forecasts of a new surplus next year, there\u2019s a chorus of calls from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) to Commerzbank AG (DE: ) for the alliance to deepen the curbs when it meets in Vienna in December.\n\nBut in recent months global markets have grown tighter, removing any immediate need to act. If extra cutbacks are announced, it would mark a break with tradition for the cartel, which typically waits for a glut to emerge before responding.\n\n\u201cIt would break the mold,\u201d said Derek Brower, a director at consultant RS Energy Group. \u201cOPEC makes policy reactively, not proactively.\u201d\n\nDepressed oil prices may compel the group to change its habits. has slumped about 20% in six months to around $59 a barrel in London -- below the levels most OPEC nations need to cover government spending -- and on Friday headed for a weekly loss of 1.4%. A renewed sell-off in 2020 would squeeze revenues even further.\n\n\u2018Daunting\u2019 Stockpiles\n\nOPEC+, a collective of 24 producers that pumps half the world\u2019s oil, confronts a \u201cdaunting\u201d surplus in the first six months of 2020 of about 1.2 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. Demand is being eroded by the weakest global growth in a decade and the U.S.-China trade war, while supplies are swelling in the U.S. and elsewhere. As a result, the group is facing a \u201cserious challenge\u201d to defend prices, said Neil Atkinson, the agency\u2019s head of oil markets.\n\nThe coalition agreed to cut output by 1.2 million barrels a day this year, a reduction that has been compounded by a range of crises, from sanctions on Iran to a missile attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil-processing facilities. Nonetheless, traders and consultants from Gunvor Group Ltd. to Rystad Energy AS recommend a further cutback when OPEC+ meets on Dec. 5-6.\n\n\u201cIf by December there are clear signs of economic weakness, then a further deepening by a minimum of 500,000 barrels a day would be highly likely,\u201d said Ed Morse, head of commodity research at Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). in New York.\n\nOPEC\u2019s top officials have signaled they\u2019re prepared to consider this. Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the group will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to prevent a market slump and that members are willing to \u201cput all options on the table.\u201d Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, who represents OPEC\u2019s biggest member, said his job is to check a surplus.\n\nEven Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin, who leads OPEC\u2019s most important, yet often reluctant ally, has said he recognizes the need for further cooperation.\n\nYet announcing a supply cut while the market is in deficit would be a departure for the organization.\n\nWhen OPEC+ was established in late 2016, surplus inventories had ballooned to a record of more than 300 million barrels and were still accumulating at a rate of 1.4 million a day, according to the Paris-based IEA. Its current round of cuts was agreed in late 2018, when supply was exceeding demand by 2.7 million barrels a day.\n\nTardy Approach\n\nIn the past, OPEC has more typically been criticized for acting too slowly. When a surplus brews, members are reluctant to gamble that sacrificing sales volumes will be compensated by higher prices. There\u2019s also the inevitable haggling over how much each nation should cut.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s far easier for OPEC to sit on its hands, hope for the best, ignore gloomy forecasts for as long as possible and try to deal with any problems after they\u2019ve emerged, rather than start the painful and tedious negotiations that are always needed before a new deal,\u201d RS Energy\u2019s Brower said.\n\nThe group can also be tardy in increasing production. OPEC\u2019s inaction during the rally of early 2008 allowed oil prices to hit an all-time high above $147 a barrel, feeding into the global recession that sent crude tumbling later that year.\n\nWhen OPEC assembles at its Austrian headquarters in December, global markets probably won\u2019t be telegraphing any immediate surplus to be dealt with.\n\nWorld oil inventories contracted in the third quarter by the most in a decade, falling by 228 million barrels, according to OPEC, as summer demand proved surprisingly robust and the group\u2019s deliberate cutbacks were amplified by disruptions in Iran, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.\n\nStockpiles are poised to shrink further in the fourth quarter, even if the kingdom has fully restored output from the Sept. 14 missile and drone strikes, the IEA estimates. Inventories may decline by about 55 million barrels.\n\nYet the outlook for the first six months of 2020 may nonetheless spur the producers into acting. The alliance needs to cut supply by 1 million barrels a day, and the only question now is the timing, said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former oil official at the White House under President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cNormally it\u2019s OPEC\u2019s habit to wait until they can see the oversupply in the whites of the eyes,\u201d McNally said. \u201cBut the heavily swollen balances for the first half of next year may push them to cut production earlier than planned.\u201d", "description": "OPEC\u2019s Next Meeting May Unveil New Approach to Cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf3942a66b22cddd16551d40d68efc65f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
