The band has also been cast in 9kt gold taken from the motherboard of smartphones.\n\nJames popped the question last Wednesday (Picture: O2)\n\nThe unique piece (Picture: O2)\n\nIt\u2019s believed to be the first ever ring to be made entirely of smartphones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project was a collaboration between O2 Recycle and sustainable jewellery experts Lylie\u2019s.\n\nHayley and her ring (Picture: O2)\n\nJames said: \u2018I met my fianc\u00e9e Hayley on Tinder and quickly realised she was the one for me. The foundations of our relationship were built by spending hours sharing messages every day and having long telephone conversations before bed every night.\n\n\u2018Those foundations turned into a house that we now share with our 10-month-old daughter and I wanted to celebrate the phones that brought me together with the love of my life.\n\n\u2018Hayley thought the ring looked beautiful and jumped at the chance to show all of her friends, she couldn\u2019t be happier with the sentiment.\u2019\n\nMORE: Couple\u2019s engagement photoshoot recreating Pinterest picture goes so wrong\n\nMORE: Couple wows the internet with their nude, pizza-filled engagement shoot\n\nMORE: Bride is savagely mocked for engagement ring that looks like \u2018a squirt of mayo\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A Wiltshire couple have become the first to get engaged with a ring made entirely out of their iPhones after they met on Tinder", "authors": ["Lizzie Thomson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_93232059_1572262380.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
