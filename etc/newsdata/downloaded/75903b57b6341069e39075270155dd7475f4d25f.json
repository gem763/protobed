Dealers decreased inventories by $400 million in the third-quarter of this year, after having increased inventories by about $800 million in the year-ago period, Caterpillar said.\n\n\"Our volumes declined as dealers reduced their inventories, and end-user demand, while positive, was lower than our expectations,\" said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby. \"We remain focused on executing our strategy and continuing to achieve our Investor Day targets for margin improvement and free cash flow.\"\n\nBeneath the headline revenue miss, Caterpillar\u2019s key construction industries and energy and transportation business segments also missed sales expectations and dropped on a year-on-year basis. In construction industries, the segment comprising the bulk of Caterpillar\u2019s machinery sales, revenue slumped 29% in the Asia Pacific region but posted a modest 3% rise in North America.\n\nThe Deerfield, Illinois-based company also lowered its full-year profit guidance. It now expects profit per share of between $10.90 to $11.40, versus previous guidance for as much as $13.06 per share.\n\nCaterpillar construction machines sit parked the Patten Cat dealership in Hammond, Indiana.

These factors have disincentivized machinery spending by many of Caterpillar\u2019s customers this year.\n\nCaterpillar\u2019s results come just after a week after the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast for a fifth consecutive time.\n\nAmid these concerns, Morgan Stanley analysts on Friday downgraded Caterpillar\u2019s stock to equal-weight from overweight, underlining \u201cincreasing downside risks\u201d to Caterpillar\u2019s construction and energy and transportation segments.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the U.S. construction equipment market peaked in 2019 and that E&T [energy and transportation] markets will fail to re-accelerate in 2020,\u201d Morgan Stanley equity analyst Courtney Yakavonis wrote in a note Friday. \u201cOur NA [North American] construction equipment replacement cycle analysis suggests that replacement will revert to a headwind in 2020 while elevated dealer inventory levels have also materially increased the risk of a dealer inventory de-stock.\n\n\u201cWe are also concerned about pricing heading into 2020, and think that margins could still be under pressure next year even if input prices fall,\u201d Yakavonis said. And while growth in the company\u2019s resource industries and buybacks have helped buoy Caterpillar\u2019s earnings per share thus far, these may be unable to offset expected declines in Caterpillar\u2019s construction and E&T segments next year, she added.", "description": "Caterpillar reported third-quarter results that missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations, underscoring the industrial bellwether\u2019s ongoing struggle to sell equipment against a slowing global growth backdrop.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.0C4.FkI.f0UWTrzm34i5Q--~B/aD0yMzM2O3c9MzUwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/0cc648f0-f4ff-11e9-beef-c30e7b3da986", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
