The Avalanche closed out an impressive six-game road trip with a 4-1-1 record in Bellemare's first game against his former team since signing with the Avalanche in the summer.\n\nColorado, which has scored at least one goal in 23 of its 30 regulation periods, dominated Vegas from the drop, sparked by Bellemare's goal 28 seconds into the game.\n\nWilliam Karlsson scored for Vegas.\n\nVegas' former fourth-line center intercepted Mark Stone's cross-ice pass, skated around Deryk Engelland and sent a shot past Marc-Andre Fleury to give the Avalanche a 1-0 lead.\n\nColorado Avalanche goaltender Philipp Grubauer (31) makes a save against the Vegas Golden Knights during the second period of an NHL hockey game Friday, Oct. 25, 2019, in Las Vegas.

Vegas' 26 shots on goal were its second-lowest this season.\n\nFleury was replaced by Garret Sparks with 7:24 left in the second period after allowing four goals and making just 22 saves. Sparks, who won 14 of his 37 career appearances with Toronto, allowed two goals and made 13 saves in his first appearance with Vegas since being acquired from the Maple Leafs in July.\n\nAfter Kadri made it 2-1 just before the end of the first period, Makar extended Colorado's lead to two with his first NHL goal.\n\nKadri netted his second goal of the game when Nathan MacKinnon moved past Cody Eakin at the top of the circle and sent a perfect pass into the slot. Kadri's one-timer got past Fleury on the blocker side and essentially ended his night.\n\nBellemare led a 2-on-1 break and dished to Calvert, who skated in and beat Sparks high on the glove side to give the Avalanche a 5-1 lead. Calvert scored his second goal late in the third period, a short-hander also assisted by Bellemare.\n\nVegas dropped to 3-3-0 at home this season.\n\nNOTES: A video tribute for Bellemare was played during the first period, drawing a standing ovation from the sellout crowd. ... Makar leads all NHL rookies in assists (8) and is tied for first with Buffalo's Victor Olofsson with nine points.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nColorado: Hosts the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday\n\nVegas: Hosts the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday in the second of a four-game homestand.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nVegas Golden Knights left wing William Carrier (28) checks Colorado Avalanche center Colin Wilson during the first period of an NHL hockey game Friday, Oct. 25, 2019, in Las Vegas.
