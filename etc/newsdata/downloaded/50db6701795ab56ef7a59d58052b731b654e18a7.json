While the NBA defended Morey\u2019s right to free speech, Commissioner Adam Silver said Beijing asked him to fire the Rockets executive, while Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James accused Morey of failing to consider the potential financial ramifications that could stem from his tweet.\n\nSpeaking on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA\u201d on opening night of the 2019-20 season, O\u2019Neal said Morey was right to call attention to the Hong Kong protests.\n\n\u201cOne of our best values here in America is free speech. We\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say and we\u2019re allowed to speak up about injustices, and that\u2019s just how it goes. If people don\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s something that they have to deal with.\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cI just thought it was unfortunate for both parties and then you have people speaking when they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. But Daryl Morey was right. Whenever you see something wrong going on anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say \u2018that\u2019s not right.\u2019 That\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nMorey has not made any public comment on the situation since he attempted to clarify his views in a series of tweets earlier this month. The NBA has said he will not face any discipline over his tweet.\n\nJames has faced widespread criticism in recent days over his reaction to Morey\u2019s tweet. The Lakers star has said he will not comment on the situation again.\n\nThe NBA has yet to resolve its dispute with Chinese sponsors. While NBA games are once again being broadcast on Tencent Sports, the league\u2019s streaming partner in China, state-run CCTV has pulled games off the air.\n\nDuring a recent appearance at the Time 100 Health Summit, Silver said he told Chinese government officials that there was \u201cno way\u201d Morey will be fired or disciplined. Beijing has denied requesting that Morey be fired.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cAgain, you know, when it comes to business, sometimes you have to tiptoe around things. But again, they understand our values, we understand their values and here, we have the right to speak. Especially with social media, we can say whatever we want to say, when we want to say it,\u201d O\u2019Neal said.\n\n\u201cChina can\u2019t us what to do and we can\u2019t tell them what to do. That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d he added.\n\nO'Neal's remarks came during a lengthy discussion on TNT's pre-game coverage of the opening night of the NBA's 2019-20 season in Los Angeles. When TNT returned to its set for halftime coverage, a Hong Kong flag was on prominent display in the crowd.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "The NBA\u2019s business interests in China have been at a standstill since Morey\u2019s Oct. 6 tweet generated backlash from Chinese fans and government officials.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Shaquille-Neal-Getty-001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
