After growing up on the tony Upper East Side of New York City, she has made a thriving career out of poking gentle fun at the richest of the rich who live there.\n\nBut even after a lifetime of living among them, Kargman still seems gleefully shocked by today\u2019s ostentatious displays of wealth. \u201cIn the 80s, even though it was this very decadent, Gordon Gekko \u2018greed is good\u2019 time, there was this real embarrassment of riches,\u201d the 45-year-old told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Jen Rogers for the series My Three Cents. \u201cSo the girls in my class who had drivers and limos, they asked to be dropped off two blocks away from school because it was embarrassing, whereas now they're pulling up with the driver in the SUV and they're flaunting logo bags. Everything is so over-the-top and there's so much conspicuous consumption, and I find that really depressing.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the moments and characters that even this New York Times best selling writer couldn\u2019t make up: For instance, the woman who humble-bragged to Kargman that, at the end of every year, she needlepoints the tickers of her husband\u2019s top stock picks as a gift for him. \u201cI was like, \u2018I'm swallowing vomit right now. You're so embarrassing,\u2019\u201d Kargman said laughing.\n\nKeeping it real\n\nKargman may have grown up with means herself (Her father, Arie Kopelman, was President and COO of Chanel), but she has no patience for the idle wealthy. In fact, she has an ambition and work ethic that no one could ever call into question: She graduated in three years from Yale University, has written or co-written 12 books, starred in her own hit Bravo series \u201cOdd Mom Out,\u201d had a radio show, a cabaret show and is the mother of three.\n\nRemarkably \u2014and fortunately \u2014 Kargman has managed to avoid the plight of others who were raised with money. \u201cI think that the worst thing for some of the people that I see is that there's a depression where they don't have the aspiration to get rich because they're already rich,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then they still have holes in their lives and in their souls, and so they're depressed, and there's nowhere to climb.\u201d\n\nKargman credits her parents, especially her father, for teaching her the importance and value of good old-fashioned hard work. While he may have helped her land internships during college, he made sure to keep her ego in check. \u201cHe would say, \u2018I just want you to know you didn't get this internship because you're so great, you got it because I picked up the phone,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. And, in a lesson that has lasted her entire life, he insisted that she be the first one into the office in the morning, and the last to leave at night: \u201cHe just very much impressed upon me that work ethic is everything.\u201d\n\nMy Three Cents with Jen Rogers is a weekly interview series that explores celebrities\u2019 history with \u2014 and relationship to \u2014 money and career.
