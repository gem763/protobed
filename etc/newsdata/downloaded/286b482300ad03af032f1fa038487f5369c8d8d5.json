Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe four will go toe-to-toe in an extravaganza featuring special in-match challenges and surprises, floodlit finishes with holes assigned increasing monetary value.\n\nThe event, called \u2018The Challenge: Japan Skins\u2019 will tee off on Oct.21 at the Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club in Chiba, and will be played under the \u201cskins\u201d format.\n\nThe format, designed to encourage aggressive play from start to finish, forces players to win a hole outright to take a \u201cskin\u201d, with tied holes resulting in a \u201cpush\u201d of the skin to the next hole.\n\n\u201cAfter discussing The Challenge with Discovery and GOLFTV, I wanted to be a part of it,\u201d 15-times golf major champion Woods said.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been back to Japan since 2006 and the golf fans there are some of the best in the world. It\u2019s a unique format and a top field with Rory, Jason and Hideki. I can\u2019t wait to play against them on a global stage.\u201d\n\nMatsuyama hopes local support might give him an edge, while Day says the winner will be the player who best executes an aggressive strategy on every hole.\n\nMcIlroy is eager to embrace a format he says he loves.\n\n\u201cThere are so many fun elements to The Challenge that will have me wanting to take home that title \u2013 playing with Hideki on his home turf; Tiger coming back to Japan with a Green Jacket \u2014the motivation is certainly there for me, and I\u2019m a huge fan of the skins format.\n\n\u201cI love the way it rewards attacking play and think it suits my game quite well. Any time I can go directly at pins to try and make birdies and eagles, I think it puts me at an advantage.\n\n\u201cThe other fun thing about skins is how you find yourself rooting for the other guys if you\u2019re not in a position to win the hole. You\u2019re hoping they can tie with someone else so you can play for that skin on the next hole. With the escalating dollar amounts, you\u2019re always in it until the end.\u201d\n\nEvent organisers GOLFTV plan on taking the competition to all corners of the globe for future editions.", "description": "Tiger Woods will clash with Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Hideki Matsuyama in a high-stakes, globally televised golf challenge in Japan next month.", "authors": ["Ossian Shine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431460408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I07F", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
