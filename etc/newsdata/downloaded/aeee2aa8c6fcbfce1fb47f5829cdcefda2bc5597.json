The weather had topped out at 2C that day. The temperature felt particularly biting because Kochuveettil had just come from Kerala, a state in southern India where the weather hovers somewhere in the vicinity of 20-30C all year.\n\n\u201cMy God, I thought, what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d he says. Kochuveettil, 41, has since adjusted to the wind-chill: he\u2019s grown fond of Ireland while ministering to Catholics in Shannon Parish in the country\u2019s south-west.\n\nKochuveettil is one of four priests from the Cochin diocese (a Catholic administrative district) in Kerala who are currently serving in Ireland\u2019s Killaloe diocese. These men, along with other priests from abroad, are helping fill a gaping void in Ireland\u2019s clergy as priests age and younger generations eschew the once-esteemed profession.", "description": "Ireland\u2019s population is rapidly ageing \u2013 and so too are its Catholic priests.
