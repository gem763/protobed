A May 2019 survey from Discover found that 60% of consumers say that having no annual fee is a very important factor when they choose a card. And 70% of consumers are very satisfied with their no annual fee cards, while only 35% of consumers are equally satisfied with their cards that charge an annual fee. The best no annual fee cards still offer a lot of perks: competitive rewards programs, intro 0% APR periods and low interest rates.

Credit cards with no annual fee for the first year of account opening but an annual fee in subsequent years were excluded. We compared each card on a range of features, including: rewards program, introductory and standard APR, balance transfer fee, welcome bonuses and foreign transaction fees, as well as factors such as required credit and customer reviews when available. CNBC Select teamed up with location intelligence firm Esri. The company's data development team provided the most up-to-date and comprehensive consumer spending data based on the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can read more about their methodology here. Esri's data team created a sample annual budget of approximately $21,852 in retail spending. This budget is comprised of the most common spending categories, including groceries ($5,019), gas ($2,394), dining out ($3,365), travel ($2,154), utilities ($4,959) and general purchases ($3,961). General purchases include items such as housekeeping supplies, clothing, personal care products, prescription drugs and vitamins, and other vehicle expenses. CNBC Select used this budget to estimate how much the average consumer would save over the course of a year, two years and five years, assuming they would attempt to maximize their rewards potential by earning all welcome bonuses offered and using the card for all applicable purchases. All rewards total estimations are net the annual fee. It's important to note the value of a point or mile varies from card to card and based on how you redeem them. When we calculated the estimated returns, we assumed that cardholders are redeeming points/miles for a typical maximum value of 1 cent per point or mile. (Extreme optimizers might be able to achieve more value.) Our final picks are weighted heavily toward the highest five-year returns, since it's generally wise to hold onto a credit card for years. This method also avoids giving an unfair advantage to cards with large welcome bonuses. When evaluating best secured credit cards, we did not calculate the estimate rewards consumers could earn because secured cards typically come with much smaller spending limits. While the five-year estimates we've included are derived from a budget similar to the average American's spending, you may earn a higher or lower return depending on your shopping habits.\n\nBest no annual fee credit cards of 2019 Best for\u2026 Credit Card Estimated rewards earned after 5 years Cash back Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card $2,185 Balance transfers Amex EveryDay\u00ae Credit Card $1,494 Low interest Visa\u00ae Titanium Signature Rewards Card from Andrews Federal Credit Union $2,270 Building credit Discover it\u00ae Secured N/A Travel PenFed Pathfinder Rewards American Express\u00ae Card $2,266\n\nEditorial Note: Opinions, analyses, reviews or recommendations expressed in this article are those of the CNBC Select editorial staff\u2019s alone, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any third party.", "description": "We analyzed 159 of the most popular credit cards that charge no annual fee whatsoever using an average American's annual budget and digging into each card's perks and drawbacks to find the best of the best based on your spending habits.", "authors": ["Alexandria White"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106180307-1571065892071creditcards3.jpg?v=1571065904", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
