Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRight-hander Joe Ross will start in Scherzer\u2019s place against the Astros\u2019 Gerrit Cole.\n\n\u201cYesterday he had a little bit of spasms in his right trap and neck,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez told reporters.\n\n\u201cThey treated it. He woke up today a lot worse.\u201d\n\nMartinez noted that Scherzer has pitched through pain before including when he took the mound despite a broken nose and black eye, which he suffered in June while laying down a bunt in batting practice.\n\n\u201cWhen he comes in and says he\u2019s hurt this bad, he\u2019s hurt. And I can tell you now he\u2019s very upset,\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be out there with his team mates.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old said he was bitterly disappointed to miss the start but was hopeful he could pitch in Game Seven, if necessary. The best-of-seven series is tied 2-2.\n\n\u201cI woke up this morning completely locked up. I couldn\u2019t even dress myself,\u201d said Scherzer, who beat the Astros with five solid innings in Game One in Houston.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my career that would be easy to pitch through at this point. This is literally impossible to do anything with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that the doctors are right and something could be possible for Game 7.\u201d", "description": "Washington Nationals ace right-hander Max Scherzer has been scratched from his start in Sunday's Game Five of the World Series against the Houston Astros with back and neck spasms, the Nationals said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445647017&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0VH-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
