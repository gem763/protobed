Ghislaine woke me up in the morning and said, 'You're gonna meet a prince today.'\n\n\"I didn't know at that point that I was going to be trafficked to that prince.\"\n\n'Do for him what you do for Epstein'\n\nShe said she was taken to \"Club Tramp\" where Prince Andrew gave her alcohol, possibly vodka, in the VIP section.\n\nThe prince asked her to dance and the three of them - Prince Andrew, Ms Maxwell and the 17-year-old Ms Giuffre - returned to Ms Maxwell's house.\n\nMs Giuffre said that Ms Maxwell told her: \"He's coming back to the house and I want you to do for him what you do for Epstein.\"\n\nShe said the abuse began in the bathroom and moved to the bedroom.\n\n\"He wasn't rude or anything about it, he said 'thank you' and some kind of soft sentiments like that and left,\" Ms Guiffre said.\n\n\"I just couldn't believe it, that even royalty were involved.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prince Andrew: \"I would like to reiterate and reaffirm the statements that have been issued on my behalf by the palace\"\n\nMs Giuffre has previously said that she was abused three times by the Duke of York, with one incident allegedly occurring at Epstein's New York mansion and another at his estate in the Caribbean.\n\nSpeaking about Prince Andrew, she said: \"He denies that it ever happened and he's going to keep denying it ever happened, but he knows the truth and I know the truth.\"\n\nShe rejected suggestions that she was motivated by the possibility of compensation, saying that the statute of limitations prevented her making a legal claim.\n\n'Disposable'\n\nThe Duke of York said he first met Epstein, a wealthy hedge fund manager, in 1999. Ms Maxwell, described by Epstein as his best friend, was photographed several times at social events with the prince.\n\nEpstein and Ms Maxwell were also pictured together on a pheasant shoot on the Queen's estate in Norfolk.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein: What we know and what we don't\n\nIn 2010, after Epstein had been convicted of sex offences relating to procuring a minor under 18, Prince Andrew was photographed again with the financier in New York's Central Park. Footage shows him inside Epstein's mansion at about the same time.\n\nNBC also spoke to a British woman who says she was abused by Epstein, Anouska de Georgiou.\n\nShe told the network that the abuse had conditioned her to be \"silenced, isolated, secretive and shameful\" but coming together with other alleged victims had created a \"very special bond\" between them.\n\n\"Jeffrey thought that we were disposable and he threw us all away.
