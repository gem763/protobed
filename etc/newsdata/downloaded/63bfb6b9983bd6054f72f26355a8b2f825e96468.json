The question is whether they are.\u201d\n\nA brief look at the state of global anti-Semitism:\n\nUNITED STATES AND CANADA\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which called the Germany shooting \u201cheartbreaking\u201d in a Wednesday statement, reported earlier this year that violent anti-Semitic episodes in the United States doubled in 2018. Wednesday\u2019s holy day of Yom Kippur also saw an anti-Semitic incident reported in New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a statement condemning what he called \u201cthe desecration of a Holocaust memorial\u201d in the city of White Plains on the eve of the holiday.\n\nIn Canada, the government reported a 4% dip in anti-Semitic attacks last year \u2014 but only after a sharp rise in 2017.\n\nEUROPE\n\nAnti-Semitism is a top concern in Germany, where data shows reported, anti-Semitic incidents rose 10% last year, according to Tel Aviv University\u2019s Kantor Center, and where the trial of a group of alleged neo-Nazis for planning an attack in Berlin began last week. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government earlier this year affirmed its commitment to protecting Jews who wear skullcaps from anti-Semitic threats.\n\nBut beyond Germany, several other nations are grappling with spiking reports of anti-Semitic sentiment as well as behavior.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Community Security Trust charity recently reported a 10% rise in anti-Semitic incidents during the first six months of this year. In the Czech Republic, the Federation of the Jewish Communities reported a rise in anti-Semitic incidents last year.", "description": "The shooting that left two dead and several injured in Halle, Germany, on Wednesday \u2014 when Jews celebrated Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/eb72c7_correction-germany-shooting-75264-corrects-city-dresden-police-officers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
