This clashed with the Trump administration, which argued that federal law should prevent California from setting its own emissions rules.\n\nThe Justice Department is now looking into whether the automakers violated federal competition law by making the agreement, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.\n\nErin Scott / Reuters President Donald Trump had wanted to eliminate California's right to set vehicle-emissions standards.\n\nA spokesperson for Honda, reached by the Journal, said the company plans to cooperate with the investigation.\n\n\u201cHonda will work cooperatively with the Department of Justice with regard to the recent emissions agreement reached between the State of California and various automotive manufacturers, including Honda,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn the months after taking office, the Trump administration has worked to roll back efforts to cut emissions standards that were set by the Obama administration. The White House has argued that the standards make vehicles more expensive and less safe for consumers.\n\nElcovaLana via Getty Images The Trump administration has worked to roll back efforts to cut emissions standards that were set by the Obama administration.\n\nAdvocates of the emissions agreement argue that it would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to help curb climate change as well as encourage a transition to electric vehicles.\n\nMary D. Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board which sets the state\u2019s air quality standards and verifies automakers\u2019 emissions compliance, was among those who immediately spoke out against the DOJ\u2019s investigation. In a statement obtained by HuffPost, she questioned the motive of the Environmental Protection Agency and its administrator, Andrew Wheeler.\n\n\u201cThe US Department of Justice brings its weight to bear against auto companies in an attempt to frighten them out of voluntarily making cleaner, more efficient cars and trucks than EPA wants. Consumers might ask, who is Andy Wheeler protecting?\u201d she asked.\n\nFred Prouser / Reuters Cars and trucks travel on a freeway in Los Angeles. Advocates of the emissions agreement argue that it would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who advocated for the emissions deal, similarly spoke out against the Trump administration on Friday while calling the president a \u201cbully.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration has been attempting and failing to bully car companies for months now,\u201d he said in a statement obtained by HuffPost. \u201cWe remain undeterred. California stands up to bullies and will keep fighting for stronger clean car protections that protect the health and safety of our children and families.\u201d\n\nNewsom, earlier on Twitter, additionally criticized the president\u2019s plan to revoke the state\u2019s legal authorities to regulate emissions, declaring: \u201cWe\u2019ll see him in court.\u201d\n\nIf @realDonaldTrump wants to:\n\n-Cost the US $400B\n\n-Force us to consume 320 billion more gallons of oil\n\n-Make consumers pay more at the pump\n\n-Degrade our air\n\n-Risk our health\n\n\n\nAll to force a deal carmakers don\u2019t even want? Fine.\n\n\n\nThen we\u2019ll see him in court. https://t.co/X8d8VPXcBP \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) September 6, 2019\n\nMathew Miller, who served as a spokesperson for former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, also called news of the DOJ\u2019s investigation \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a really disturbing abuse of power and another sign of how politicized DOJ has become,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAntitrust law doesn\u2019t exist to punish companies for adopting policies you don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story.
