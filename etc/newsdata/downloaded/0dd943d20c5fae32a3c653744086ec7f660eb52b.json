Whether politicians are trying to fight for Brexit, fight for a deal or fight to prevent parliament being prorogued, there is going to be a lot of energy as MPs return.\n\nDespite all that, chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s autumn spending review is still going to be big news. It will highlight the ways in which this new cabinet plans to wow a public that\u2019s largely weary of austerity and wanting news beyond Brexit.\n\nIt will also lay out the battle lines if an early general election happens.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut the Treasury has also said this review will only cover one year, making it less likely there will be any major long-term changes, such as changes to taxes.\n\nSo what is likely to be in Javid\u2019s notes next week? Here are some possibilities.\n\nIncome tax\n\nDuring Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign he pledged to raise the 40p income tax threshold from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, cutting taxes for around three million higher earners.\n\nThe move would have cost some \u00a39.6bn a year, which the now-prime minister said could be paid for by savings from the no-deal Brexit fund. His plans faced criticism for helping the richest at a time when poorer people are struggling.\n\nWhether this is a priority for the government in the current climate it is hard to predict but the chancellor may want to follow through on Johnson\u2019s pledges to cut taxes.\n\nStamp duty\n\nEarlier this month, The Times reported that the chancellor was considering making house sellers pay stamp duty rather than buyers.\n\nThe idea would be that shifting the burden of the tax onto the sellers would make it easier for people trying to move up to larger homes.\n\nHowever, it was criticised as an idea on the grounds that it would put off downsizing and mean some homeowners effectively paid twice.\n\nThe chancellor quickly distanced himself from such plans but he might be tempted to make some other changes to stamp duty, particularly if he was able to benefit new buyers or people on low incomes.\n\nInheritance tax\n\nVoters widely dislike inheritance tax, despite less than 5 per cent of all deaths resulting in a tax payment \u2013 in fact, fewer than 25,000 estates are liable for the tax each year.\n\nYet the public dislike could mean that the chancellor sees tax reform as a vote-winner and something that is relatively easy to implement.\n\nLaura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, says: \u201cThe chancellor is in luck, as the hard work on looking at how to reform the system has already been done by the Office for Tax Simplification, meaning he could just adopt some or all of their recommendations.\n\n\u201cThese include reforming the gifting system, scrapping the seven-year taper and creating an online system to prevent hundreds of thousands of people having to go through the IHT process. And as far as populist moves go, slashing the death tax is a pretty good one.\u201d\n\nIR35\n\nIR35 is anti-avoidance tax legislation that is intended to tax disguised employment at a rate similar to employment. The idea is this rule prevents de facto employees from gaining the tax perks of working for themselves.\n\nFrom 6 April next year it will become the responsibility of all medium and large-sized private sector bodies to determine whether contractors fall within the IR35 legislation. That has already happened for public bodies and this move is expected to bring many more contractors into the scope.\n\nSimon McVicker, Director of Policy at the freelancer\u2019s association IPSE, says: \u201cWith so much uncertainty, the upcoming spending round and Queen\u2019s Speech must remove any added confusion and strengthen our business base.\n\n\u201cThis means scrapping the chaotic IR35 tax changes that have already damaged the NHS and are now adding burden to business. Ministers must also maintain momentum to end late payment, which causes enormous damage to freelancers every day.\u201d\n\nAffected workers may hope for sympathy from the chancellor. A decade ago he argued that the UK should \u201crepeal the silly IR35 tax\u201d.\n\nIncreased spending on schools, hospitals and police\n\nOne thing that we will definitely see in this statement is an increase in spending. The chancellor has pledged extra money for schools, the NHS and police forces.\n\nHe\u2019s keen to increase funds for those areas that particularly matter to the public, which has only increased suspicion that the government is getting ready to fight an election.\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, the chancellor said there would not be a spending spree as \u201cit\u2019s important that we don\u2019t let our public finances get out of control\u201d.\n\nHowever, he said that after a decade of austerity \u201cwe can afford to spend more on the people\u2019s priorities \u2013 without breaking the rules around what the government should spend \u2013 and we\u2019ll do that in a few key areas like schools, hospitals and police\u201d.\n\nSo increased spending in those areas is all but certain. Whether every department can expect the purse strings to be loosened seems much less likely.\n\nAll will be revealed when Sajid Javid stands up and speaks on Wednesday in his first major event as chancellor. Amid the current political and economic uncertainty he will attempt to lay down some definitive plans. Whether they will act as policy or a manifesto in a snap election remains to be seen.", "description": "September means back to school and for the country\u2019s politicians, back to a flurry of political activity.
