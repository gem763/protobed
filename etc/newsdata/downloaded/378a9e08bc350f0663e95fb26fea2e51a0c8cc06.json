This sense of memes includes \u2014 but is much broader than \u2014 the \u201cfunny picture on the Internet\u201d definition that tends to be the default when discussing Internet culture. The term encompasses a broader cultural process that\u2019s more about verbs than nouns \u2014 that is, with ways of doing things in dialogue with one another. In this sense, memes emerge through the \u201ccollective creation, circulation, and transformation\u201d of media, from behaviors to images to catchphrases like \u201cLock him up.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s biggest memetic hits during the 2016 election included promises to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d drain the D.C. \u201cswamp,\u201d build a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d wall along the southern border, and of course, to \u201cLock her up.\u201d His presidency has also generated a litany of successful memes. Disagreeable press became \u201cfake news,\u201d accountability became \u201cPresidential harassment,\u201d and a caravan of Central American refugees became a violent \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese memes have worked because they\u2019re so abstract. \u201cMAGA!\u201d and \u201cyou are fake news!\u201d and \u201cTHE CARAVAN!!\u201d aren\u2019t about making logical arguments; they\u2019re asserting feelings, often bigoted ones, about the world. Unencumbered by the anchors of specificity, these memes can travel seamlessly across social media much more easily than stories that go into specific detail about specific lives. Those stories, after all, require reading and thinking. Trumpian memes only require gut reactions, specifically fear and loathing that an amorphous them is out to get us.\n\nTrump\u2019s reliance on gut-level memes has served to motivate his base. It\u2019s also allowed Trump to dominate the attention economy. From the moment he announced his candidacy in 2015, his memes have been easy to report on. The pattern goes like this: Trump says something racist or abusive or absurd, his supporters start churning out GIFs and photoshops, Trump retweets the worst of them, his detractors go into a panic, and the news narrative writes itself. Trump\u2019s memes, in other words, have helped ensure that news cycles play out on Trump\u2019s terms.\n\nBut as Trump\u2019s embarrassing greeting at Nationals Park suggests, that dynamic has begun to shift \u2014 all the more so as the impeachment inquiry has picked up speed. While Trump\u2019s most resonant memes are endlessly remixable in their abstraction, the Ukraine scandal is concretely incriminating in its facts. As these facts have accumulated, growing more damning each day, they\u2019ve begun to disrupt his memetic force field. What\u2019s been left behind is a politician suddenly reliant on the traditional mechanisms of governance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for Trump, who\u2019s always been better at trumpeting his accomplishments than at actually accomplishing things. But it has also created space for Democratic memes to filter in \u2014 memes that remain just as tantalizing for journalists, only to much different ends. Reporters pounced, for example, when Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), echoing Trump\u2019s alterations of the official Hurricane Dorian forecast, sharpied a map in mock support of Trump\u2019s assertion that we can protect the southern border by building a wall in Colorado.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Hillary Clinton, who appears to be relishing her position as chief Trump provocateur (or \u201cMaster Troll,\u201d as the New York Times put it). Most recently, Clinton lampooned Trump\u2019s jarringly informal letter to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by tweeting a parody wherein President John F. Kennedy tells Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev that the Cuban missile crisis is going to make people \u201ccall your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEven as they hijack eyeballs that would normally be on the president, the politicians and citizens memeing their way through the impeachment inquiry are doing something different from Trump. They\u2019re grounding their memes in the specificity of the moment. Leahy wasn\u2019t just making fun of Trump\u2019s lack of geographical knowledge; he was calling attention to one of his many abuses of power. Clinton wasn\u2019t just satirizing Trump\u2019s letter to Erdogan; she was emphasizing his fundamental unfitness for office and self-serving foreign policy. She was also, of course, ensuring that in articles describing her letter, reporters would once again repeat the details of the Ukraine call.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMessages that memeify Trump\u2019s crimes are part of the same attention economy that has long benefited Trump and his memes. But now underlying arguments, rooted in things that are actually happening, are being amplified. In other words, Democratic politicians \u2014 along with everyday citizens \u2014 are using the very techniques Trump used to make us look away from his scandals to instead make us pay attention to them. For the first time in his political life, Trump can\u2019t meme the problem away.\n\nNot that he hasn\u2019t tried \u2014 but these efforts have either backfired or simply failed. For example, when he attempted to show what a \u201cthird-grade\u201d politician House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was by posting a photo of her pointing defiantly at the president during a heated White House meeting, Pelosi responded by making the image her banner photo on Twitter. Similarly, while he was able to generate some headlines after he asserted that facing consequences for his crimes was a \u201clynching,\u201d a defense long favored by powerful men , the news cycle didn\u2019t budge. Nor did it budge after the successful raid against al-Baghdadi. Many framed the raid as a \u201cwin\u201d for Trump, and he certainly did his best to create a spectacle during his presser. Still, within hours, headlines were dominated by the \u201cLock him up\u201d chant \u2014 returning the conversation, once again, to impeachment.\n\nThese failures challenge the conventional wisdom about Trump. His inability to move the needle on impeachment may be due to how richly deserving of impeachment he is. But it may also be something else: that his political success was a product of the attention economy, journalistic amplification and everybody else doing his PR work for him \u2014 even when the goal was to condemn him. In other words, it\u2019s looking like the God Emperor has no clothes.\n\nAD", "description": "The catchphrases that once let him control the attention economy have been hijacked by his opponents.", "authors": ["Whitney Phillips", "Ryan M.
