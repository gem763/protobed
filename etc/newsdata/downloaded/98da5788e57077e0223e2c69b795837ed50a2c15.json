More than 2,700 objections to the scheme were received.\n\nCampaigners condemned the decision, saying the new facility would add to the strain on local services, and that expanding a prison system stricken with record levels of violence and despair was not the way to solve the prison crisis.\n\nBut prisons minister Lucy Frazer said it would create and support \u201chundreds of jobs\u201d and be a \u201cmajor boost to the local economy\u201d.\n\nFrances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \u201cThis is a disappointing decision. There were thousands of objections, and the residents of Full Sutton will now have to live next to a huge prison that will create crime and add to the strain on local services.\n\n\u201cExpanding a prison system mired in record levels of violence and despair is not the answer.\u201d\n\nPeter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \u201cEvery government for the last 30 years has tried to build its way out of the prisons crisis. The solution is not more prisons, but fewer prisoners.\u201d\n\nLocal police also raised some concerns about the plans when making their representations in relation to the now-approved planning application.\n\nSuperintendent Simon Gawthorpe said at the time that the extension to HMP Full Sutton would have the potential to increase demand on the force\u2019s officers and the local service they provide, including a higher number of incidents in the prison and additional traffic around the jail.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
