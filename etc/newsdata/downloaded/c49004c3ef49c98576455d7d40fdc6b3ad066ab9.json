It's at those junctures that your life changes.\n\n\"To look at what we're doing now... the artists and releases we're working with, it's surreal.\n\n\"And as much as it's nice to reflect, we're also focused on the next steps. You can't get caught up in your own hype, that's how you get left behind.\"\n\nImage caption Two Door Cinema Club have worked with Transgressive for a decade\n\nTwo Door Cinema Club started working with Transgressive in 2009, attracted by their approach of \"doing the opposite of what is sensible a lot of the time\".\n\n\"I don't think they ever think, when they take an artist onboard, whether they're going to sell a million albums or not,\" says frontman Alex Trimble.\n\n\"We have streaming and social media so you have this instant access to numbers and algorithms.\n\n\"So many people are turning their gaze towards those things as an idea of how an artist is going to perform, but Transgressive do things based on gut.\"\n\nGive honest feedback\n\nImage copyright Matilda Hill Jenkins Image caption A&R Manager Mike Harounoff and Project co-ordinator Grace Manning make up the Transgressive team\n\nAnother key element for any label is finding new talent.\n\nAt Transgressive, a lot of that responsibility falls to A&R manager Mike Harounoff.\n\nHe's has worked in the business for 10 years after meeting Lilas on her way to a Mystery Jets show, and realising not everyone in the music industry was \"a big man in red braces and a briefcase\".\n\n\"A&R in its most basic sense, stands for artist and repertoire.\n\n\"It's finding new artists, getting them settled with the company and working on new songs and how and when we release them.\"\n\nThis means he often finds himself having difficult conversations with acts about music they might have been working on for years before showing it to the label.\n\n\"You don't always agree on the music but nor should you try to disagree.\n\n\"You've got to be honest with each other.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Marika Hackman has now released three albums and is managed by Transgressive\n\nIt's important for that relationship to continue in the studio.\n\nDuring the making of her latest album Marika Hackman told Newsbeat \"It's about them knowing me really well\".\n\n\"They know how to manage my expectations without being a massive downer.\n\n\"That's important because I've worked with people before who will be like 'You're gonna be a star'... and then that doesn't happen.\n\n\"Tim and my mum are still the first people who hear my music and I just need validation from them that I'm not going insane.\"\n\nImage caption Foals are one of the label's longest-running acts\n\nBe the 'good guys'\n\nTransgressive were the first label to sign the alternative rock band, Foals, who have gone on to win multiple awards and release six albums. They have continued working with them throughout their career.\n\nAlthough they now release music on Warner, they still have a publishing deal with Transgressive which means they work with the band before and after release to get songs heard by as many people as possible.\n\nAlong the way, the band have been offered deals by other labels but say they're keen to keep working with \"the good guys\" in the music business.\n\n\"We were still at university and not even considering being in the band as a profession and they wanted to sign us,\" explains drummer Jack Bevan.\n\n\"Transgressive have smashed the glass ceiling and are beyond the good guys.\n\n\"You can be seduced by the business aspects of being in a band but that's never been us. We want to work with people we trust and respect.\"\n\nStep outside your comfort zone\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Australian producer Flume is among the acts Transgressive now work with\n\nBy the late 2000s, the indie guitar bands that some labels had committed to were starting to go out of fashion.\n\nAs other genres became more mainstream and tastes generally became more eclectic, the label adapted and started to find sounds from all over the world.\n\nTheir roster now includes a German orchestral group, a multi-instrumentalist from the US combining jazz and psychedelic pop, and dance producers.\n\nBack in 2012, they signed Australian producer Flume who has over 9m monthly listeners on Spotify.\n\n\"When that largely London/UK scene started dissolving we were lucky that we weren't tied to a mast,\" says Toby.\n\n\"We'd gone off on a different UFO mission really - it's like we were somewhere else altogether.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption KOKOKO! are one of Transgressive's latest singings\n\nThey also work with African collective KOKOKO! who are originally from the Congo.\n\n\"Other labels were dropping names of people and genres they were working with and it didn't really match up with us,\" says band member Xavier Thomas.\n\n\"It's important to not be pigeonholed and they were genuinely keen to work with us.\n\n\"You can't fake that level of excitement, unless they're really good actors but they seem to still be enthusiastic about working with acts like us.\"\n\nMental health matters\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nA growing concern for the music industry is the health - both mental and physical - of everyone involved in the release of new music.\n\nFor Transgressive, the issue has been fairly prominent over the last couple of years for one of the acts they manage - Ben Gregrory, the frontman of indie-rockers Blaenavon.\n\nIn January, the band released a letter to fans explaining how Ben had been recovering from a \"stress-related breakdown\" around Christmas 2017, which had delayed the release of their second album and led to the cancellation of several shows over the last couple of years.\n\n\"I can't describe in words how much they've had my back,\" says Ben.\n\n\"My relationship with Toby is long-winded and complicated but all for the best reasons.\n\n\"If I'd been on any other label in the world I genuinely don't know if I would have been able to do it.\"\n\nImage caption Ben posted a note about his mental health to fans on social media\n\nToby says that when it comes to supporting artists, the issue becomes \"more than just a band on our label\".\n\n\"We care about them as much as family members.\n\n\"The industry is still learning how to support artists properly on a soulful, mental, physical level.\n\n\"It's still very early days in knowing how to nurture and care for people.\"\n\nEverything changes, all the time\n\n\"It's not the kind of career where there's a set ladder for anyone.\"\n\nGrace Manning joined the company as a project co-ordinator just over a year ago after meeting Tim at a conference for women in music.\n\nShe says her job has taught her there's \"no one-size-fits-all plan\" for releasing music anymore.\n\n\"I'd love to say every project is the same and I go 'Right, we've got eight weeks until it comes out, this is everything we need to do. Done'.\n\n\"That's not how it works at all.\n\n\"The industry is modernising so quickly and putting out music is so different to how it was 10, even five, years ago.\n\nWhile discussing how they teased singer-songwriter Marika Hackman's new album, Grace suggests some of the label's approach plans can feel \"very experimental\".\n\n\"We have no guarantee of success, however you want to measure success these days.\"\n\n\"It's risky and scary but a lot of fun - that's the only way to do it really.\"\n\nToby says the first 15 years of the company is just the start.\n\n\"In another 10 to 15 years we'll hopefully still be active, doing what we love with the same values but everything's changed yet again... God knows in what ways.\n\n\"Music feels like a barricade at times and anything creative feels like it could be hard to get into. But it can happen for you.\"\n\nRadio 1 Newsbeat's new documentary How To Survive The Music Industry: The Transgressive Story is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "We go behind-the-scenes, on stage and on the search for new talent with one of UK's biggest independent labels.", "authors": ["Jimmy Blake", "Newsbeat Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rpfh0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
