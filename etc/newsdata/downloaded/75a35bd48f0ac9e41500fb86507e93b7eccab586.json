The debate has been going on for a long time now, but what happened recently has sparked it up all over again.\n\nFour people who went to watch Dhanush-starrer Tamil movie Asuran at a movie theatre in Bengaluru were forced to leave during the intermission for all they did was not stand up during the national anthem.\n\nIt is said that the national anthem was played at the beginning of the movie. After a few people didn\u2019t stand up, a lot of them protested, but because the lights were switched off, the protest died down soon.\n\nDon't Miss 26.5 K SHARES 45.1 K SHARES 14 K SHARES 18 K SHARES 6.5 K SHARES\n\nLater, during the intermission when the lights were turned on again, people in the theatre caused an uproar. They were shamed to an extent that they were asked \u201care you Pakistani terrorists?\u201d\n\nOne of the man hurling abuses at the group has been identified as actor Arun Gowda. He shamed men and women for \u201cnot sparing 52 seconds for the country.\u201d The video has gone viral on social media.\n\nDisgusted to see youngsters not respecting India and our national anthem ... see the resistance to stand up when being rendered in a theatre ! pic.twitter.com/6Yti6795K0 \u2014 Karuna Gopal (@KarunaGopal1) October 29, 2019\n\nThe incident has kickstarted the debate again. Here\u2019s how people reacted!\n\nRe the national anthem in theatres situation - YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IN CLOSED ROOMS. I learnt this at Naval Public School in 10th grade. pic.twitter.com/m50l2Nuzfm \u2014 Rachita \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc36\ud83d\ude34 (@visualfumble) October 29, 2019\n\nI have always felt that there is no greater insult to our National Anthem than it being played in movie Theatres.\n\nMost of the times, some B grade movie will be playing.\n\nThe over priced popcorn and water in theatres - Multiplex should be the thing that people should stand up. \u2014 Basalelu #ChaloVizagNov3 (@BasaleluPspk) October 28, 2019\n\nI will stand up for my National Anthem irrespective of where it is being played. Having said that I do believe that movie theatre is not a place to play it. Although I would stand for it even then. \u2014 shruti (@vyasshruti) October 28, 2019\n\nThere is a difference between patriotism and jingoism.\n\nSTOP PLAYING NATIONAL ANTHEM IN THE THEATRES. https://t.co/HHC2BmEoW3 \u2014 Amon (@leftesla) October 28, 2019\n\nOur supreme court says it is not mandatory to stand in theatres where national anthem is part of the movie.

How many remember that in 60\u2019s each Bollywood movie ended with National Anthem? I was 5yrs old, 1965, and distinctly remember black and white \u2018Tricolour\u2019 fluttering across full screen. \u2014 @ColSanjayPande (@ColSanjayPande) October 28, 2019\n\nFirstly Playing a National Anthem in Theatres where huge funny things happen is a wrong .\n\nGoons coming & compelling someone to Stand for National Anthem is a stupidity.\n\nIs There any necessary to prove someone Nationalism.\n\nCompelling is prohibited idiots pic.twitter.com/t88VDoONLc \u2014 Asgar Shaik\ud83d\udc4b (@Asgar7599) October 28, 2019\n\nThe incident took place at PVR orion mall.", "description": "Does standing up during the national anthem demonstrate patriotism?
