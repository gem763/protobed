It was later separated from the army and rebranded in 2005 as a domestic budget airline.\n\nCUA is now a subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines, the second-largest airline in the country behind Air China.\n\nI took CUA\u2019s Flight KN 5955 from Beijing to Shanghai for 1,994 yuan ($282) earlier this month. I flew out of the brand new Beijing Daxing International Airport.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nUntil a few weeks ago, CUA flew out of Beijing\u2019s Nanyuan Airport, which is much smaller.\n\nIt has now officially moved all its flights to Daxing, which officially opened to commercial aviation in late September 2019.\n\nYou can read about my journey through Daxing, Beijing\u2019s futuristic new airport, here.\n\nThe futuristic new airport had hundreds of these self-check-in kiosks equipped with facial-recognition technology and adorned with a Chinese flag.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nHowever, I was told to check in at the counter because I didn\u2019t have a Chinese passport.\n\nI missed my boarding announcements while exploring the airport, but managed to make my flight at the last minute. Here\u2019s a photo of my gate, which says in Chinese that we\u2019re flying to Shanghai at 3:40 p.m.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nI got to fly on a medium-sized Boeing 737 plane, which had roughly 26 rows of six seats \u2014 three on each side of the aisle. It was almost completely full.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nWhen I got to my seat, I was grateful to find a small bottle of water tucked inside the airplane pocket in front of me \u2014 I was exhausted after running to the gate.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nIn the pocket was also a flyer explaining how to travel into the city from Daxing Airport. This would presumably be more useful for people traveling to, rather than out of Beijing.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nThe amount of leg room was better than many budget European airlines I\u2019d previously been on.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nShortly after, flight attendants \u2014 wearing a dark blue traditional Chinese dress with a red belt, and a silk scarf \u2014 started giving a safety demonstration.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nThere was a TV screen for every three rows that showed promotional SkyTeam videos on silent from takeoff to landing.\n\nSoon after take-off we were given free food in a China Eastern Airlines paper bag. I was surprised we were given free food for a budget flight that was only two hours long.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nInside was a small container of apple juice, a walnut pie, what looked like was a chocolate- or jam-filled French pastry, and a wet towel. The juice was good and the walnut pie tasted average, but the last snack was the biggest shocker \u2014 despite looking like a croissant it was actually filled with some sort of cold chicken breast.\n\ncaption The contents inside the CUA\u2019s bag of food, clockwise from left to right: The French pastry (containing chicken), walnut pie, apple juice, and wet towel. source Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nMoments later \u2014 around halfway through the flight \u2014 the flight attendants served us boiling water.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nThough being served hot water may sound odd to foreigners, it\u2019s totally normal in China \u2013 Chinese medicine suggests that cold water is harmful to the body, so you can forget about being served iced water in here.\n\nI also spotted several water dispensers with only hot and warm water available while traveling through Beijing Daxing Airport.\n\nAbout an hour later, around 5:40 p.m., we approached a foggy-looking Shanghai and seamlessly landed at Hongqiao International Airport.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nI was lucky that my flight landed on schedule because according to the Airportia flight tracker, KN 5955 is usually on time only 23% of the time, with an average delay of 38 minutes.\n\nDisembarking was efficient as we didn\u2019t have to board any buses to arrive at the terminal.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nOnce inside the airport, I immediately found more hot water dispensers \u2014 a ubiquitous sight in Chinese airports. The boiling water had a safety lock on it to keep out of children\u2019s reach.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nI only had carry-on luggage, so all I had to do was board a series of moving walkways to the arrivals hall. It only took me about 20 minutes to get from the plane to Hongqiao\u2019s metro station.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nHongqiao Airport is linked to Shanghai\u2019s metro system. I bought a 4-yuan ($0.56) ticket to the city by scanning a QR code on my WeChat app.\n\nsource Andrea Verdelli/Business Insider\n\nAfter about an hour on the busy Shanghai subway, I arrived in the city center around 7 p.m. I left feeling like I had a seamless flight \u2014 except for the food.", "description": "Business Insider - I recently flew from Beijing to Shanghai on China United Airlines, which used to belong to the People's Liberation Air Force in the 1980s..
