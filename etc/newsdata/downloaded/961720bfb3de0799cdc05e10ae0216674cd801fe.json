Jonquel [Jones] was great, bounced back from the other night. . . . But the rebounding was a huge concern. When Elena went out \u2014 I thought that she did a terrific job in Game 1 on Jonquel on the boards, and that went out the door. So we\u2019ve got to do it the hard way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn the WNBA: In a Game 2 chess match, the Mystics were missing a queen\n\nThe Mystics appeared shaken from the moment Delle Donne left the court, even though they weren\u2019t aware of what, exactly, her injury was. She headed back to the locker room, where a group of Mystics medical staffers reportedly worked on her back for the majority of the game. With just under 10 minutes to play, she was officially ruled out.\n\nDelle Donne, 30, has had problems with her back before \u2014 it was a back issue that hindered her during her first WNBA \u00adFinals appearance in 2014 with the Chicago Sky. Last week, during the semifinals, she arrived at the team\u2019s first practice in Las Vegas with her lower back wrapped. She and Thibault said the extra support was to help with stiffness after a long flight, and she played with the wrap on in Game 3 of that series.\n\nAD\n\nThibault said Delle Donne will get an MRI exam Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nThe Mystics did not wilt in her absence, even drawing even early in the fourth quarter, but ultimately they couldn\u2019t match the Sun\u2019s firepower.\n\nWNBA season started with questions. It\u2019s ending with optimism.\n\nMeesseman scored 23 points on 10-for-17 shooting going up against 6-foot-6 Sun center Jones, a George Washington graduate. Hawkins scored 16 points to go with six rebounds, and Powers added 11 points, most of which came in a third-quarter run. Guard Kristi Toliver was the only starter in double figures with 13 points and seven assists.\n\nWashington shot 47.2 percent overall and 31.8 percent from the three-point line. The Mystics seemed unable to settle down after their franchise centerpiece went down, and the Sun \u2014 already on solid footing thanks to a stronger start than their slow first quarter in Game 1 \u2014 seized upon Washington\u2019s uncertainty.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had situations before like this when great players have gone down in games, and there\u2019s a real tendency to relax. There\u2019s a tendency to say, \u2018Oh, maybe things are going to be easier,\u2019 \u201d Connecticut Coach-General Manager Curt Miller said. \u201c . . . But this franchise has played stretches without her before. So we knew that we weren\u2019t going to get an easy break just because she was out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFocus intact, Connecticut played through Jones (32 points, 18 rebounds including nine offensive boards) with Courtney Williams (22 points) playing second fiddle on an offense that attacked the struggling Mystics. On defense, Connecticut out-rebounded Washington by a whopping 41-27 margin in what many Mystics players said was their cardinal sin of the night.\n\nAlyssa Thomas was free to drive without Delle Donne\u2019s presence and added 21 points to a team that played hard from whistle to whistle, rarely letting up despite Delle Donne\u2019s injury.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe could have pulled this out if we would have bought into the defensive end a little bit more,\u201d Mystics starting guard Natasha Cloud said.\n\nOnce Washington settled down in the second half, it made a series of runs and finally pulled even at 76 with barely more than eight minutes to play. But the ball started sticking on the Mystics\u2019 offensive end, and when it ended up in Toliver\u2019s usually steady hands, she missed three consecutive shots against the Sun\u2019s strong defense.\n\nAD\n\nConnecticut didn\u2019t waste the opportunity, pulling back ahead by six points in 71 seconds, and Washington never got another whiff of the lead.\n\nRead more on the Mystics:\n\nMystics guard Ariel Atkins lets her shot do the talking in WNBA Finals\n\nSoutheast D.C. has long been a hoops hotbed, so the Mystics are right at home\n\nWhen Mystics go to work in WNBA Finals, it\u2019s business casual\n\nTwo torn labrums won\u2019t stop Alyssa Thomas from chasing a WNBA title\n\nTerps well represented in these WNBA Finals\n\nAD", "description": "League MVP departs in first quarter with back spasms and does not return as Connecticut evens series with 99-87 win.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qAbRy_ouqssiE5tepK8Fx2HHSik=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JG3367XEXEI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
