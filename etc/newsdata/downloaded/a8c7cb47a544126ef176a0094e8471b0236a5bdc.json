They eased the conditions on the financial markets, increased demand and price growth. So for now we are keeping our present strategy.\u201d\n\nThere was room for more action, though the central bank would have to consider the cost and effectiveness of any new move, he said. The ECB was also expecting governments to adjust their fiscal policies to the new economic conditions, he added.\n\nEuro zone banks will have to adjust to those new conditions partly by consolidation and adapting to technological changes, Vasle told the station.\n\nVasle said he expected ECB\u2019s governing council would continue to make decisions by consensus after the bank\u2019s leadership changes - Christine Lagarde is expected to replace Mario Draghi in the top job in November.", "description": "Global economic conditions are very complicated, and the European Central Bank will likely have to take more action \"in the coming months, quarters and years,\" ECB governing council member Bostjan Vasle said in an interview aired on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
