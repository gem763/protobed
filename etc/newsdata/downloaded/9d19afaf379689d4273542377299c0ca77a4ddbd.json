M1 (193 miles long) - 112,098 roadworks 2. M6 (232 miles long) - 76,474 roadworks 3. M62 (107 miles long) - 37,071 roadworks 4. M5 (163 miles long) - 58,239 roadworks 5. M4 (189 miles long) - 42,399 roadworks 6. M40 (89 miles long) - 6,333 roadworks 7. M25 (117 miles long) - 4,994 roadworks Source: Highways England data provided to Select Car Leasing\n\nThe M1 topped the list with the most roadworks since the start of 2015. Many of them are believed to have been put in place to convert big parts of it into smart motorway\n\nIt found that the M1 had 112,098 separate road works carried out from the start of 2015 to September 2019.\n\nThe M6, which is 40 miles shorter, had 76,474.\n\nRoadworks per mile on England's motorways in the last five years 1. M1 - 580 roadworks per mile 2. M6 - 530 roadworks per mile 3. M5 - 357 roadworks per mile 4. M62 - 346 roadworks per mile 5. M4 - 224 roadworks per mile 6. M40 - 71 roadworks per mile 7. M25 - 42 roadworks per mile Source: Highways England data provided to Select Car Leasing\n\nMark Tongue, director of the vehicle leasing firm, said the figures tallied with other surveys it had conducted where it had found the M1 to be the 'most frustrating highway for UK motorists when it comes to roadworks, delays, disruptions and diversions'.\n\nWhile almost 112,098 roadworks over five years sounds a staggering amount, much of this is down to how Highways England defines them.\n\nThe government agency refers to everything from temporary lane closures, bridge repairs, barrier re-tensioning, carriageway sweeping, hard shoulder closures, pothole repairs, speed restrictions and even horticulture works as 'roadworks'.\n\nSurprisingly, the M25 came bottom of the list with just 4,994 roadworks in the last five years - meaning the M1 had twenty times as many.\n\nNot that this makes the London Orbital route any less susceptible to tailbacks.\n\n'You look at the stats for the M25 and you might assume that fewer roadworks results in fewer disruptions and therefore a more pleasant driving experience compared with other motorways of a comparable distance,' Tongue said.\n\n'But on the flip side it might also mean that the overall condition of the M25 is suffering much more than other motorways because it's not being maintained.'\n\nSurprisingly, the M25 came bottom of the list with just 4,994 roadworks in the last five years\n\nHighways Agency defines temporary lane closures, bridge repairs, barrier re-tensioning, carriageway sweeping, hard shoulder closures, pothole repairs and more as roadworks\n\nIn recent weeks Woking MP Jonathan Lord backed a petition calling on Highways England to resurface a section of the M25 described by one resident as 'the worst bit of motorway I have ever driven on'.\n\nThe offending stretch is between Junction 10, at Wisley, and Junction 11, at Chertsey, with a nearby residents group saying they can no longer tolerate the terrible sound it causes.\n\nA Highways England spokesman responded saying: 'We are aware of concerns which have recently been raised regarding the noise generated by driving over the concrete section of the M25 between junctions 10 and 11.\n\n'Despite the noise on this section, the road is completely safe to drive on.\n\n'However, a scheme is underway to renew the joints between the concrete slabs which will reduce the noise and improve the driving experience on the M25 between junctions 8 and 11.'\n\nThe M25 might have endured the fewest roadworks, but drivers are still regularly caught in jams on the capital's orbital route\n\nWith the smart motorways network set to double in size by 2025, drivers are being warned to expect to see more signs like this\n\nEach year national watchdog Transport Focus conducts a Strategic Roads User Survey to gather data on road user satisfaction on major and minor roads across the country.\n\nIts latest figures for the previous financial year revealed how the M6 scored worst among the major motorways, with an overall satisfaction rating of just 72 out of 100, with delayed journey times a particular issue.\n\nThe M6 was closely followed by the M25, with a score of 76, and the M1, with a score of 77.\n\nMeanwhile the highest ranking motorway in the satisfaction stakes is the M11 - which runs between London and Cambridge - and which had a score of 92.\n\nA Highways England spokesperson said: 'Roads play a vital role in keeping the country moving and as we continue to deliver \u00a315billion worth of improvements we work hard to plan and carry out our work in a sensible and responsible way.\n\n'We also do all we can to ensure drivers get the information they need about any expected delays and face the least disruption to their journeys as possible.\n\n'The majority of the large-scale improvements we\u2019ve already completed have added much needed capacity to some of our busiest roads and we have carried them out while keeping over 95 per cent of lanes available to reduce the impact on drivers.\n\n'We have also cleared 88 per cent of all incidents within an hour, reducing delays caused by accidents.'\n\nGovernment figures say that in 2018-19, 98 per cent of the network was kept open to traffic. Meanwhile, 88 per cent of incidents on the motorway were cleared within an hour, and more roadworks are being carried out at night.", "description": "The 193-mile route connecting Leeds with London is not the nation's longest route or busiest, though has been undergoing renovations to convert big parts of it into smart motorways.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
