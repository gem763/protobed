(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nI have noticed you are not laughing.\n\nI have noticed, indeed, as we near the anniversary of a wonderful confirmation of great innocence, as a new book and news story suggest there were more allegations against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh that were never looked into properly, that you are taking this all very gravely indeed. You are going so far as to get up in arms over a little tweet that described a penis in someone\u2019s face as \u201charmless fun.\u201d You are acting as though something real could have been hurt. Could it be that you do not have a sense of fun?\n\nLet me clarify. People (boys) are entitled to have fun. Could it be that you do not know what fun is?\n\nHarmless fun is when nothing real is hurt: when two friends knock the head off a doll, say, or hit a baseball as hard as they can into the window of a house where no one lives, or when two friends have a really good time, throwing something around \u2014 a toy or a Frisbee or maybe a frightened girl. Fun is when there is laughter, enough to etch itself into someone\u2019s hippocampus.\n\nFun is what I do to you. You can tell because I am laughing. (I have noticed that you are not laughing.) You must consider that this is all in good fun, good harmless fun, as popping a balloon or stealing someone\u2019s bag lunch or knocking over someone\u2019s drink or holding down a girl until she is terrified she cannot breathe. A cheerful and salutary incident in which nothing of value was harmed or lost, when no one who belongs or matters is startled or afraid. Fun can even be scary, as when you think that there are going to be consequences for an action, but then it turns out at the last minute that there won\u2019t.\n\nSo many things are fun, when you have the right perspective. Calling people funny names! Grabbing someone by the \u2014 anywhere! Chanting! Telling someone to die, humorously and ironically! Anything can be fun if no one is hurt. (If you are hurt, you are no one.)\n\nFun is when no one is harmed, when no one real, no nice young fellows with promising careers who are allowed to say \u201cjust kidding\u201d any time they want are endangered. Are you laughing yet? If you laugh hard enough, anything can be laughed off. Why do you insist on being hurt when being hurt is the one thing that will make you less real?\n\nTake it. Take the joke. Take it. If you remember that this is harmless fun, then it does not matter whether it keeps happening, whether it happens to anyone. It does not even matter whether it happens to you, or to your family. It ceases to be something you wish to stop or from which you wish to protect others. It becomes something over which you can laugh and shake hands, or smile, and shake your head.\n\nThis lack of laughter on your part leads me to suspect you are a humorless killjoy, the type of person who is harmful and not fun! Harmful fun is when a deserving young lad fails to obtain a deserved position. Harmful fun is when a fledgling career is wounded! That is unthinkable, and a loud outcry is warranted.\n\nSo let us suppose there really was an incident. Even, perhaps, multiple incidents. Would it have been worth inquiring into? Hardly.\n\nWe can agree that, after all, these were just fun. Just good, harmless fun.\n\nRead more from Alexandra Petri:\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s record player and his hot-air balloon of memory\n\nPlease enjoy Facebook Dating!\n\nJim Mattis\u2019s book is NOT about the president", "description": "I have noticed you are not laughing.", "authors": ["Alexandra Petri", "Columnist Offering A Lighter Take On The News", "Opinions Of The Day", "September At Pm", "Alexandra Petri Is A Washington Post Columnist Offering A Lighter Take On The News", "Opinions Of The Day.
