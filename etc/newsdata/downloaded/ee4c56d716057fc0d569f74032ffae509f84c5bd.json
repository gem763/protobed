There were inconsistencies in her stories, the agent wrote. They wondered about her parade of sports cars and even her age. They asked for their money back; to date, they have not gotten it, the agent wrote.\n\nNeither have most other victims of the woman, whose real name is Siew Im Cheah. Over the past two decades, prosecutors say the Malaysia-born con artist, now 59, has stolen at least six identities and several fortunes. From Virginia to California she would take on the personas of her roommates and nail technicians, then use those identities to profit from a series of scams.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne federal prosecutor described her in court as \u201ca one-woman crime spree.\u201d Another, in a sentencing motion, said she \u201chas perfected the art of identity theft.\u201d\n\nShe convinced professional athletes and successful executives she was the granddaughter of Singapore\u2019s first prime minister and a close friend of President Obama. The money they gave her for supposed investments in Ni\u00adger\u00adian oil and D.C. sports they now believe she spent on high-end cars, plastic surgery and designer handbags.\n\n\u201cHad we known she was not being honest about her real identity, age and criminal background, we never would have trusted her,\u201d the sports agent wrote in a letter to the court. She \u201cis very manipulative and has shown no remorse for the heartaches she has caused.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe can 'infiltrate the mind'\n\nCheah pleaded guilty this year in Alexandria federal court only to identity theft and fraud, having been caught speeding through southwest Virginia in a Porsche with an old roommate\u2019s driver\u2019s license.\n\nAD\n\nUp until her Oct. 4 sentencing, at which Judge T.S. Ellis III put her in prison for 51 months, Cheah\u2019s true identity was in question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little confused about what name to use for you,\u201d Ellis told the small, quiet woman with chin-length black hair streaked white.\n\nShe said her name was Sau Hoong Lee, and her lawyer said she was 66 years old. Prosecutor Gordon Kromberg jumped up in objection.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not 66 years old, the woman whose identity she stole is 66 years old. She\u2019s 59,\u201d he declared. \u201cSau Hoong Lee is just another identity which she stole.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCourt records say her victims included a chef, a trainer, multiple manicurists and an appointee of a Virginia governor. The sports agent declined to comment and his client, a prominent Redskins player who was not named in court papers, did not return requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nVictims described a mix of anger and awe at Cheah\u2019s near-mystical powers of persuasion. At first she was personable and affectionate. She wowed them with her fancy cars and clothes and apparent connections to the wealthy and famous. But some said she soon became demanding and when challenged, cruel, threatening them with ruin.\n\n\u201cShe does not use guns, knives, or any other sort of physical weapon like many criminals,\u201d Alan Perez wrote in a letter to the court. \u201cLanguage, and emotion are her weapons, and armed with them she can easily infiltrate the mind of anyone she wishes to prey upon.\u201d\n\nWhen she was arrested in 2017, prosecutors say Cheah was living in a $14,000-a-month high-rise on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles, leased under the name of a friend\u2019s unwitting mother.\n\nAccording to court records, she has claimed various people allowed her to use their names and that she planned to pay them back for any debts she incurred.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a brief phone interview from jail, Cheah said the people who spoke against her \u201cwere not victims at all\u201d and had \u201cnothing to do with the situation\u201d that put her behind bars. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been a very generous woman,\u201d her attorney Bill Hicks added. \u201cPeople invest money all the time; sometimes they win, sometimes they lose.\u201d\n\nIn court he argued that prosecutors were provoked not by what she did but the mysterious ways she did it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re upset because they would like to know everything about her,\u201d he told the judge.\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery federal agents have been trying to solve for years. When Cheah\u2019s daughter got married at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington in 2015, FBI agents were watching. Kromberg is a national security prosecutor, and according to a person familiar with the investigation, authorities initially suspected Cheah had ties to Chinese intelligence. For years they found no trace of her big spending in bank records. One victim said she would use him as a middleman for wire transfers and take her money in cash. In past court proceedings, Cheah said she lived off her past earnings as a plastics executive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to court records, the woman born Siew Im Cheah entered the U.S. from Malaysia on a visitor\u2019s visa under the name Sau Hoong Lee in 2001. The real Lee is a homemaker in the suburbs of Kuala Lumpur who says she never met Cheah.\n\n'Who would make something up like this?'\n\nHer first known crime in the U.S. dates to 2004, when she was convicted of burglary, auto theft and identity theft in Monrovia, Calif., for stealing her landlord\u2019s name and driver\u2019s license to buy a BMW.\n\nIn 2011 she was arrested in Monterey Park, Calif., after writing a bad $350,000 check under the name \u201cClaudia Lee\u201d to buy a diamond ring that she then pawned for $100,000. A year later, calling herself Teresa Cheah, she stole the identity of a roommate. Under the name Cindy Tran she opened a bank account, cashed out a life insurance policy, sold her roommate\u2019s two cars and bought a new one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2012 she took Tran\u2019s name across the country into a group house in Northern Virginia. Her roommate Cindy Lin started incurring debt on credit cards she had never opened, being chased by the IRS for taxes on casino jackpots she never won, and racking up traffic tickets in cars she never drove.\n\nFinally, in 2016, Lin contacted police in Brunswick, Va., about a speeding ticket and was shown a body camera image she recognized as her \u201cmother figure\u201d behind the wheel of a 2017 Porsche with her Shih Tzu, Sushi, in her lap. Lin learned that Cheah had used Lin\u2019s license when pulled over for speeding at least four times in Ferraris and Porsches registered in the names of various men.\n\nOne was Alan Perez, who met Cheah in 2015 when working as a chef at a Houston restaurant. \u201cCindy Lin\u201d drove up in a drop-top red Ferrari with California plates. They bonded over their hatred of the city and spontaneous natures. For someone as rich as she claimed to be, Perez said, Cheah was wonderfully down-to-earth.\n\n\u201cIt happened so fast, within a couple months,\u201d he recalled. In some part of his mind, he said he never trusted her. But in another, she became and remained the \u201cbig sister\u201d who had showered him with love.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven as his debt racked up and Cheah became harsh and demanding, he agreed to move with her to L.A. and start a nonprofit. She coached him on how to talk to police if they asked about her, telling him she maintained multiple identities because she worked for the CIA.\n\n\u201cThe avenue of least resistance was to go deeper,\u201d Perez said.\n\nShe left him $250,000 in debt, he said, most of which he wrote off by going bankrupt, and took money from his parents as well, leaving them estranged.\n\nShe charmed Perez\u2019s family by saying she wanted \u201csimple and modest pleasures.\u201d She impressed other victims with lies about her grandeur. She said she had access to a government investment fund in Singapore through her family but was \u201cGoogle-proof\u201d to avoid being killed by the people who kidnapped her father.\n\nAD\n\nCheah\u2019s connections to the rich and famous were why Jimmy Rhee thought Lin was the real deal. She once introduced him to the Redskins player at a Porsche dealership, Rhee said, and she claimed to be friends with Redskins owner Daniel Snyder.\n\nAD\n\nAnd when Rhee visited Cheah while she was sick, he saw flowers with a card that appeared to have been signed by President Obama. He now believes she sent them to herself.\n\n\u201cShe was always creating, manipulating a fictitious situation and environment,\u201d Rhee said. \u201cShe was a master at that.\u201d\n\nRhee was then-Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell\u2019s assistant commerce secretary when he met Cheah, who persuaded him to invest $300,000 in a Ni\u00adger\u00adian oil venture. She seemed to know the oil and entertainment businesses well, and she had financial documents that appeared to back up her claims.\n\n\u201cShe is a very, very personable lady,\u201d Rhee recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to resist her friendship.\u201d\n\nWhen he started pressuring her to pay him back, he said she put him off with talk of her plans to build a training facility for the Wizards.\n\nThe supposed head of the company Cheah started for that project was Lawrence Jones, her boxing coach at a local studio. Not long after they met, she bought him a Porsche and told him he should pursue his dream of owning his own gym.\n\n\u201cIt was a nightmare from there,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt obligated to be at her beck and call.\u201d She would wake him up in the middle of the night and demand he drive her to hotel meetings with visiting oil executives still on African time. No business deals panned out.\n\n\u201cShe was telling me that her dad was killed in a plane crash that had been hijacked by terrorists,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was so elaborate. Who would make something up like this?\u201d\n\nAfter about a year, he cut off contact. Lee Kuan Yew \u2014 the first Singapore prime minister, who she claimed was her grandfather \u2014 had died, and Jones watched the funeral on television. His whole family was present; Cheah was not among them.\n\nAsked by Ellis how Cheah could afford a lawyer, Hicks said she still has good friends. Present in the gallery was James Lange, a former professional boxer and Redskins coach. In a letter to the court, he said Cheah hired him as a personal trainer and proved herself \u201cimpeccable with her word.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter is Martin Scruggs, a former CIA officer who met Cheah through his girlfriend.\n\n\u201cI sincerely believe that the use of the ID\u2019s was an attempt to protect her while she conducted business to provide for herself, her family, and others,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAt sentencing, Cheah said little, except that she was sorry to learn Perez\u2019s father had cancer and that she would like to reach out with her sympathies.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Perez asked an FBI agent if he could get a restraining order.", "description": "Siew Im Cheah, who prosecutors say was involved in several scams, is serving a 51-month prison sentence", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Pwv8sQ8Uy7K82upDrTVqQTshOFI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/43YWCIXWRII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
