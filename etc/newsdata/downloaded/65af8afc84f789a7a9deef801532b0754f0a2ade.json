With Witron (which is building two automated distribution centres for Coles) we're paying for the equipment until we own it, but with Ocado we're paying more fees based on delivery, so it's a slightly different model than normal.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupermarkets' stocks to rise\n\nDespite Jefferies' reservations about CFCs, Jefferies Australia initiated coverage on Coles earlier this month with a buy recommendation and a share price target of $17, 26 per cent higher than the average price target of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and well above the current market price of $15.27.\n\nJefferies analyst Michael Simotas, who joined the bank from Deutsche Bank last month, said Coles and Woolworths stood to gain as inflation returned to the market and independent and specialty retailers lost market share.\n\nMr Simotas also downplayed the threat from newcomer Kaufland, saying it was unlikely to have a material impact for some time because the hypermarket format was unlikely to resonate with Australian consumers.\n\n\"We expect Coles to continue to lose market share to Woolworths for two more years while still growing at a level sufficient to underpin modest operating leverage, resulting in supermarket [earnings] growth of about 4.5 per cent from the 2020 base,\" Mr Simotas said.\n\nJefferies also has a buy on Woolworths and a price target of $42.50, compared with the market price of $37.95.\n\n\"Coles and Woolworths are trading well above consensus valuations, but in a world of\n\nlow yields and macro uncertainty, we believe they will continue to outperform given their stable earnings, solid cash generation and the strengthening industry thematic,\" Mr Simotas said.", "description": "Coles boss Steven Cain is confident centralised fulfilment centres will be cheaper and faster than the micro-fulfilment centres Woolworths plans to use.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_941%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b32db6b5ef6cdc3062359ff30239ccacac620816", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
