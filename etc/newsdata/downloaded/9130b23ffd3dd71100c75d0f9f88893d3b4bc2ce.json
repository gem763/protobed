The panelists of \u201cThe View\u201d weighed in on the recent sentencing of Amber Guyger, an off-duty police officer sentenced to a decade in prison for murdering her neighbor in what she says was a tragic accident.\n\nThe victim, Botham Jean, died from wounds he sustained after Guyger opened fire upon entering an apartment she thought was her own, but was Jean\u2019s. Jean\u2019s brother, Brandt Jean, spoke at Guyger\u2019s sentencing and said, \u201cI forgive you.\u201d He ended his statement by asking the judge if he could hug Guyger.\n\nBehar dismissed the notion of unconditional forgiveness, saying, \u201cTo me there are some crimes that are so heinous that they\u2019re unforgivable.\u201d She added, \u201cI think that to hold on to the rage gives you strength also. I\u2019m not sure you have to forgive so quickly.\u201d\n\nFellow panelist Whoopi Goldberg defended Brandt Jean\u2019s right to forgive his brother\u2019s killer, but also sympathized with Behar\u2019s point of view. \u201cHe thought his brother would have wanted him to forgive her, and none of us can judge that,\u201d said Goldberg. She added, \u201cWe\u2019ll always have to ask the question \u2018could we be so big?\u2019 I don\u2019t know if I could be.\u201d\n\nViewers on Twitter were split over Brandt Jean\u2019s forgiveness of Amber Guyger and his embrace of her in the courtroom. Many wrote that they agreed with Behar and wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive if they were in the same situation:\n\nHis emotions are still raw...when the spotlight no longer shines, it will hit him like a ton of bricks the fact that he wrapped his arms around a devil for all the world to see. \u2014 SUNSHINE! (@YetaSunshine) October 3, 2019\n\nI am SO impressed with Joy Behar for being real and authentic in her responses to this segment today! Joy had the courage to speak against the obviously popular opinion that forgiveness should be automatically given. \u2014 Jack Richter (@SingerJack) October 3, 2019\n\nOthers disagreed with Behar and said that forgiveness is the only way to truly begin to heal:\n\n@JoyVBehar @TheView\n\nIf you think \"some things aren't forgivable\", Joy you still haven't figured it out. That's the point of forgiveness, to forgive, especially, the most horrendous things bcuz if you can do that, you can create peace. Holding a grudge will never create peace. \u2014 Se\u00f1or Momentz (@heylair) October 3, 2019\n\n@TheView On the hugging brother... The only way to move on and not let the anger overwhelm your life is to forgive. Every religion addresses it.\n\n\n\nThose that can't forgive are doomed to live in dread and despair \u2014 Schmedley Johanson (@Springisnow) October 3, 2019\n\nHillary Clinton shares her biggest campaign regret:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
