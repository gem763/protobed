The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O\u2019Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organization logos.\n\nThe video was shown last week at an American Priority conference at Trump\u2019s Doral Miami resort, the newspaper said. Trump was not there. Event organizer Alex Phillips told the Times the video was played as part of a \u201cmeme exhibit\u201d and was not associated with or endorsed by the conference \u201cin any official capacity.\u201d \u201dAmerican Priority rejects all political violence,\u201d he said, and is looking into the matter.\n\nThe video includes the logo for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign but Tim Murtaugh, spokesman for the re-election organization, told the Times the \u201cvideo was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.\u201d\n\nThe setting for the massacre is the \u201cChurch of Fake News,\u201d capturing Trump\u2019s familiar refrain about news stories and organizations that he considers to be fake news.\n\nIn the video, Trump\u2019s face is superimposed on a killer\u2019s body as he shoots people in the face and otherwise assaults them. Among the targets: former President Barack Obama, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff, who as Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is leading the impeachment inquiry of Trump.\n\nLate Sunday, the White House Correspondents Association issued a statement saying it was \u201chorrified\u201d by the video.\n\n\u201cAll Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President\u2019s political opponents,\u201d said Jonathan Karl, WHCA president. \u201cWe have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nCNN, The Washington Post, BBC, PBS, NBC and Politico are among the news organizations depicted as victims of the fake Trump\u2019s violent fury.\n\nThe White House declined immediate comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A graphically violent parody video, shown at a meeting of President Donald Trump's supporters at his Miami resort, depicted a likeness of the president shooting and stabbing his opponents and members of the news media in a church, The New York Times reported Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/trump_98297_c0-124-3000-1874_s1200x700.jpg?6f06f4aee5bb8338517b1376bdd55b0df3bd0bc5", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
