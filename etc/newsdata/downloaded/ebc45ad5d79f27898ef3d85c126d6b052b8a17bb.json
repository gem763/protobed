YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE {{item.title}}\n\nI have never eaten as much food as I did travelling to all the Radisson hotels in South Africa.\n\nTo say that the hotel group pride themselves on their gastronomic experiences on offer to guests is an understatement - but they have the right to boast. From their three hotels in Cape Town to their Port Elizabeth property to their two Sandton offerings, their chefs and bartenders can whip up some of the most delicious dishes in the country.\n\nREAD: From waitress to executive housekeeper at the Radisson: How this super-mom of five didn't give up\n\nAnd they don't shy away from dietary requirements either - in fact it's almost seen as a challenge to the chef to come up with just-as-delicious alternatives to suit each appetite.\n\nIn Port Elizabeth you can make your own pizza, in Cape Town you can opt for star sign cocktails at Residence, delight in local flavour on Radisson Red's rooftop, get yourself into a sugar coma at Waterfront's Sunday Buffet (which I happily did), learn how to plate a starter at Sandton and indulge in cityscape views at Radisson Blu Gautrain.\n\nDespite being part of a global group, these hotels all have their own distinctive identity, fitting into their surroundings and taking on the local flavour. Talking to the chefs and bartenders behind the food and cocktail creations, the passion is as evident in person as it is in their food, and Radisson is capitalising on it.\n\nAnd when you're done gorging yourself, hit up the Amani Spa in Port Elizabeth and Waterfront to help massage all those calories away.\n\nWATCH: Always say 'yes' to a Radisson RED party\n\nHere are a few must-try dishes at each hotel:\n\nPort Elizabeth\n\nMilk and honey ice cream dessert with honey crumble.\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nOh Honey Bee cocktail with Espolon tequila, Fabbri sweet and sour mix, Martini Bianco, Fabbri strawberry and soda water.\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nCape Town Residence\n\nPi\u00f1a colada from Ghibli bar.\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nLamb served with broccoli stems at the Tobago's Restaurant.\n\nREAD: From the promenade to Chinese dumplings - the wonder of Cape Town's lively Sea Point\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nRadisson Red Silo\n\nButternut gnocchi with goats cheese sauce and deep-fried sage leaves.\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nLegally Green salad with green beans, baby peas, baby spinach, avocado, garlic chips and a lemon and caper dressing.\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nWaterfront\n\nSalted caramel cake with a bottom layer of cheesecake at the Sunday Lunch buffet.\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nBiltong-spiced beef fillet with blue cheese croquette, pumpkin puree, charred butternut and herb pomme anna jus.\n\nSEE: Waterfront's new Battery Park a city-to-sea connector for family fun\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nSandton\n\nLemon and pea risotto at their Vivace Restaurant.\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nGrilled sea bass in a coconut chilli and lime sauce, tender stem broccoli, orange and fennel salad and squid ink caviar.\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nGautrain\n\nDeconstructed cheesecake and the Cape Malay lamb curry.\n\nWATCH: The ultimate travel foodie bucket-list 2019\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\n*Disclaimer: Gabi Zietsman from Traveller24 was hosted by Radisson.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
