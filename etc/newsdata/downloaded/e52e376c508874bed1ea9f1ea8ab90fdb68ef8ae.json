Since then the Terps have scored a total of 17 points in consecutive losses.\n\nAD\n\nLorenzo Harrison III to have knee surgery, further depleting Terps' running back corps\n\nRutgers, meanwhile, is in a downtrodden state that has largely defined the program since it entered the Big Ten. It dismissed Chris Ash on Sunday, a day after it lost to Michigan to fall to 1-3 on the season and 8-32 in three-plus years under Ash. Tight ends coach Nunzio Campanile, who joined Rutgers last year after previously leading a powerhouse high school program in New Jersey, was elevated to interim coach.\n\nAD\n\nMaryland had an interim coach all of last season but under much different circumstances, after the death of offensive lineman Jordan McNair overwhelmed the players with grief and the program with controversy. Under Matt Canada, the Terps knocked off a ranked Texas team to open the season and later nearly beat Ohio State in overtime. That\u2019s why Maryland\u2019s players are \u201cwell aware\u201d of the challenge Rutgers could bring, Locksley said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would imagine, knowing Coach Ash and the type of team he developed, that these guys will rally together to form a bond and play for each other. So we expect them to have all types of effort.\u201d\n\nLocksley has experienced both sides of this situation. His tumultuous tenure as head coach at New Mexico ended when the school fired him midseason. The Lobos finished the 2011 season 1-7 with an interim coach after an 0-4 start under Locksley.\n\nAD\n\nA few years later, Locksley was an offensive coordinator at Maryland who became the interim coach when the school fired Randy Edsall. Locksley said his focus in that situation was making sure the seniors enjoyed their final games as Terps because \u201cthose are the kids that get kind of screwed when you fire coaches in the middle of the year.\u201d Locksley\u2019s group won one game out of the final six but nearly beat Penn State at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore in the first game after Edsall\u2019s firing.\n\nAD\n\nNow Rutgers will begin navigating this scenario with Campanile at the top of the ladder, at least temporarily, because Rutgers also fired offensive coordinator John McNulty. Campanile will have a chance to guide the Scarlet Knights through the majority of the 2019 campaign while also taking on play-calling duties.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is making sure that we take care of our players, that we give them a chance to be successful, that we keep them together,\u201d Campanile said Monday at a news conference. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a tough time for them, and our leaders are doing a great job of keeping everybody on task.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked whether he felt ready to take on the lead job, Campanile said, \u201cI guess we'll find out in the next eight weeks.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen Maryland faces the Scarlet Knights, Rutgers could look a bit different with its new play-caller, but no team can overhaul its scheme in less than a week. Campanile said the adjustments would come more in the form of \u201cjust streamlining what we do.\u201d\n\nBut those within Maryland\u2019s program also see the opportunity for a switch in mentality, a willingness to take risks that might not be present on tape from earlier this season.\n\n\u201cYou can expect anything,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cWhen I was the interim coach, one thing I know that I used to say was, \u2018Hey, you can do anything you want. We can fake punts.\u2019 So our guys have to be prepared for any and everything because, again, these guys have nothing to lose.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet this is still the Rutgers team that struggled immensely this season and in previous years. After all, the school felt it had reason to justify firing its coach in September. Rutgers\u2019s only win came against Massachusetts in its season opener. Since, the team failed to score against Michigan and Iowa and posted only 16 points in a loss to Boston College. Rutgers sits at or near the bottom of the conference in most statistical categories.\n\nBut even with losing records every year since 2014, the Scarlet Knights have beaten Maryland in two of five tries since both became Big Ten members.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doubting anybody,\u201d Maryland defensive back Antoine Brooks Jr. said this week. \u201cJust because they don\u2019t have a coach, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not going to fight.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTerps basketball, deeper and more experienced, expects a longer March run this season\n\nMaryland receiver DJ Turner charged with DUI\n\nD-III football players say choice to forfeit season after injuries was theirs, not college\u2019s\n\nPenn State hammers Maryland, 59-0, in Big Ten opener\n\nAD", "description": "The Terps appear to have an opponent tailor-made for a confidence-boosting win in the Scarlet Knights, who are less than a week removed from firing their coach.", "authors": ["Emily Giambalvo", "Reporter Covering University Of Maryland Athletics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pQU49V3spRskytnLdJa-cxJ31-M=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YBFI5KXCFII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
