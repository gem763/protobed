REUTERS/David Gray\n\nThe budget deficit in the 2018/19 fiscal year-ended June 30 was A$690 million ($470 million), effectively 0% of gross domestic product, far better than the forecast in its April budget for a A$4.2 billion shortfall, or 0.2% of GDP.\n\nThe surplus for the current year will be \u201can improvement\u201d on its earlier forecast of A$7.1 billion, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg added, but did not provide a new forecast.\n\nThe cheer over the windfall was overshadowed by separate data, however, also out on Thursday that showed Australia\u2019s unemployment rate at a one-year high of 5.3%, reinforcing expectations of more central bank stimulus.\n\nThe Australian dollar AUD=D3 skidded to a two-week low under $0.6800 as traders saw increased chance of a rate cut in the absence of fiscal stimulus anytime soon.\n\nFinancial futures are now predicting a 76% chance of a cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to 0.75% at its Oct. 1 policy meeting, from a 50-50 probability before the data. Another reduction to 0.5% is now almost fully priced-in for February. <0#YIB:>\n\n\u201cThe government needs to be responsive to the economy\u2019s needs,\u201d CommSec chief economist Craig James said. \u201cA balanced budget in the next year may be more appropriate than producing a big surplus in the current fluky economic times.\u201d\n\nDespite two back-to-back easings by the RBA there are few signs of revival outside of the housing sector.\n\nGrowth in the country\u2019s A$1.9 trillion economy ($1.3 trillion) slowed to a decade-low last quarter, inflation has undershot the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target for almost 3-1/2 years and consumer spending has been sluggish in recent months.\n\nThe RBA has said it would like to see the unemployment rate fall to around 4.5% to help generate wage pressures. That looks like a tall order, as the jobless rate has been edging up since it fell to 4.9% in February, the lowest since 2008.\n\n\u201cA higher unemployment rate suggests that stronger wage growth is unlikely for the foreseeable future,\u201d said Callam Pickering, economist for global job site Indeed.\n\n\u201cA cut at either their October or November meetings seems all but certain at this stage,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nFISCAL STIMULUS\n\nRBA Governor Philip Lowe has repeatedly laid out the importance of government spending and structural reforms to spur economy-wide growth and inflation, having already eased twice this year.\n\nBut the conservative government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison has refused to budge from its stance. Earlier this month, Treasurer Frydenberg reiterated the government\u2019s commitment to the \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d goal of a budget surplus in 2019/20.\n\n\u201cThis would frustrate the Reserve Bank,\u201d said Kaixin Owyong, Melbourne-based economist at National Australia Bank.\n\nA growth slowdown together with Thursday\u2019s weak unemployment number led economists at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) to join their counterparts at Westpac (WBC.AX) in forecasting an October policy easing.\n\nCBA does not expect the unemployment rate to improve this year despite expectations of further policy easing by the RBA.\n\n\u201cWe have long held the view that fiscal easing would be the better policy option than further monetary policy easing, especially with the RBA within reach of the lower bound,\u201d CBA economist Belinda Allen wrote in a note.\n\nShe listed several policy measures that could be employed including bringing forward \u201cshovel-ready\u201d infrastructure projects as well as early tax cuts for households and changes to income tax brackets.\n\n\u201cThere is considerable room for fiscal stimulus to compliment easier monetary policy that has been put in place since the RBA easing cycle commenced in June,\u201d Allen added.\n\nInvestors will next focus on a Sept. 24 dinner speech by RBA Governor Lowe that might further shape market expectations for the Oct. 1 policy meeting.", "description": "Australia's government said on Thursday its budget was in balance for the first time in a decade and a surplus this year was all but certain, though fiscal stimulus to boost jobs and growth was still seen unlikely for now.", "authors": ["Swati Pandey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431448190&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I061", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
