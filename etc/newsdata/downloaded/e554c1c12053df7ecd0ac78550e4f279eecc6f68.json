Or the personal essay that propels you into the exclusive program in the first place.\n\nFor this installment of Success Insider, your regular guide to making things happen in your life, we'll be perusing some transformational texts \u2014 and getting to know a remarkable 27-year-old inventor. Let's just say some lightbulbs are about to turn on, for all of us.\n\nOur writer Robin Madell profiled Aja Edmond, pictured above. Edmond is a 2012 grad from Stanford GSB, and she graciously shared with us the unedited version of the admissions essay that she submitted in 2009.\n\nIn Edmond's estimation, the essay is what got her into what's become the most-selective b-school in the US.\n\n\"I had a vision of how I wanted to position myself in order to accomplish this, and the essays were extremely instrumental in helping me showcase myself accordingly,\" she said.\n\nThe essay, like most pieces of highly effective professional writing, was crafted with specific design goals.\n\n\"It was most important that I show how I greatly exceeded the admissions requirements and would gain from and add value to the program,\" Edmond said. \"I felt a strong urge to show how I had to overcome a lot to get to where I was, and how my humble background uniquely positioned me to add a diverse perspective to the program.\"\n\nDig in \u2014 and get in \u2014 here.\n\nOur corporate innovation reporter Joe Williams has been canvassing the data and information chiefs at America's largest companies, as they turn their legacy firms into tech shops unto themselves.\n\nAnd digital transformations, like anything else, require inspiration.\n\nMark Maybury, the chief technology officer at Stanley Black & Decker, recommends \"Factfulness: 10 Reasons We're Wrong About The World \u2014 And Why Things Are Better Than You Think\" by the late demographer and statistician Hans Rosling, whose posthumous book outlines how to think more clearly and critically about the world. \"It will really take your mind for a ride, and it'll show you history in a visual way, with data analytics and graphics that will change your perception of the world,\" he said.\n\nHe also lauds \"Influence Without Authority\" by Allan Cohen and David Bradford, a management classic about getting people across departments \u2014 including those outside your team \u2014 to execute on the same vision. That's a must-do for today's leaders, technical or not.\n\nAdd to your reading list here.\n\nThe entrepreneur-inventor Greg Yeutter told us a telling fact about himself.\n\nAs a baby, his first word was \"light.\"\n\nYeutter, as a young adult, would then go to Drexel University's dLUX Lab, which studies the role of light in the modern world. And he realized, in great depth, that we get too much of the wrong kinds \u2014 like the blue and green lightwaves that keep you up at night.\n\nSo he built a better bulb. Specifically, the Bedtime Bulb, available on Amazon, landing Yeutter as a finalist for the tech giant's first-ever \"Small Business Owner Under 30\" award.\n\nHe walked our small business reporter Dominick Reuter through how he identified an unmet issue, poured his research background into finding a solution, and finally marketing the product and operationalizing the business.\n\nRead more about Yeutter here, and meet the entire crop of Under-30 finalists here.", "description": "The essay is one of the hardest and most important parts of the business school admissions process.
