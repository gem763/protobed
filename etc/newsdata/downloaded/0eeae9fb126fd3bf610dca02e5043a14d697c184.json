REUTERS/Omar Ibrahim\n\nAnti-government protests that have swept the country since Thursday have pulled together all segments of Lebanese society in an unusually unified call for the downfall of a political elite that protesters blame for plunging the economy into crisis.\n\nOn Sunday demonstrators clogged streets across the country for a fourth day with marches resembling outdoor festivals. Loudspeakers blared nationalistic music as energised protesters chanted calls for the government\u2019s fall.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect people from the country\u2019s north, south and Beirut to join hands and like each other. The protests have brought together everyone and this has never happened before,\u201d said Sahar Younis, a 32-year-old worker with a non-governmental organisation.\n\nHariri, who is leading a coalition government mired by sectarian and political rivalries, gave his feuding partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree to reforms that could ward off economic crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign.\n\nHe accused his rivals of obstructing budget measures that could unlock $11 billion in Western donor pledges and help avert economic collapse.\n\nGovernment sources said Hariri was waiting for his coalition to get on board with the economic proposals, which include taxes on banks and implementing a plan within one month to overhaul the country\u2019s costly and crumbling state electricity utility.\n\nReforming the country\u2019s wasteful electricity sector is key for potential investors and donors who consider it one of the biggest strains on the country\u2019s depleted finances.\n\nPressure on Hariri has mounted as a rising chorus of voices, from union leaders to politicians, join popular calls for his government to resign. The Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces party said late Saturday its four ministers would withdraw from the government.\n\nIf Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who is traditionally backed by the West and Sunni Gulf Arab allies, resigns it would be harder for the various parties that make up the ruling coalition to form a new cabinet.\n\nA new cabinet would also likely see Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies more in control, a shift that would make it nearly impossible for international donors or Gulf Arab countries at odds with Iran to offer aid or investments.\n\nEnding rampant corruption is a central demand of the protestors, who say the country\u2019s leaders have used their positions to enrich themselves for decades through favourable deals and kickbacks.\n\n\u201cAll of the leaders should be put under house arrest and be held accountable to return the money they stole from the state so Lebanon can get back on its feet,\u201d said Antoine Zahli, 43, a pharmacist who was among the protesters in downtown Beirut.\n\nCharbel Antoun, a 17-year-old student added: \u201cWe want to stay in Lebanon to build our future but if these corrupt politicians stay here what future will be left for us?\u201d\n\nHEZBOLLAH SUPPORT\n\nHezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has thrown his powerful Shi\u2019ite group\u2019s weight behind the current government, saying the country\u2019s deep economic crisis means precious time should not be wasted forming a new one.\n\nNasrallah said on Saturday that imposing more taxes on people could lead to an \u201cexplosion\u201d of unrest and warned of the risk of bankruptcy and currency devaluation if the government failed to come up with solutions.\n\nWithout a foreign funding boost, Lebanon faces bleak economic prospects. Officials and economists also predict a currency devaluation or a debt default within months if it fails to sure up its finances.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nThe IMF said last week that Lebanon\u2019s crisis requires tough austerity measures such as tax hikes and levies on fuel, steps the country\u2019s politicians have publicly vowed not to take.\n\nThe mounting unrest was triggered in part by a proposed fee on WhatsApp calls, a measure quickly scrapped but that was seen by many as the latest government attempt to squeeze citizens receiving little in return from the state.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy registered just 0.3 percent growth last year. The IMF said the reforms were needed to stem a ballooning deficit and public debt it forecasts to reach 155 percent of GDP by year-end, one of the world\u2019s highest.", "description": "Protesters in Lebanon flooded the streets on Sunday, keeping pressure on Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri as a self-imposed deadline to deliver a package of badly needed reforms for the country's crumbling economy drew near.", "authors": ["Eric Knecht", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443002575&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0F9", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
