The brand\u2019s hair ties fit in easily with the loose, colorful, casual look of the late \u201980s and \u201990s. For about a decade, the scrunchie was the default way Americans put their hair up.\n\nThen the 2000s came, and everything got really tiny and tight, including hair ties. Nylon-wrapped black elastic cords became the norm. Any look will fade away after it hits critical mass, but the golden age of scrunchies had an unusually ignominious and decisive end: The style was the butt of a famous Sex and the City joke in the early 2000s that declared the scrunchie hair tie non grata for fashionable city-dwellers. Carrie Bradshaw found it hopelessly middle-American and middle-class.\n\nThe scrunchie was mostly relegated to the home, used to hold people\u2019s hair in place while they slept or washed their faces. Now, those tiny, tight hair bands have been in favor even longer than their predecessors. Consumer restlessness is right on time, and the 1990s are the obvious choice for reconsideration, for reasons that run much deeper than hair accessories.\n\n\u201cWe've reached that 20-plus-year marker that often \u2018gilds\u2019 a previous decade,\u201d says Nancy Deihl, a fashion historian and a professor at New York University. \u201cThe hairstyles, the skirts, the earrings\u2014it's all looking fresh again.\u201d Far beyond the apparel world, the careful combination of nostalgia and novelty is frequently what makes a particular product a hit with consumers. Scrunchies fit that rubric perfectly. \u201cWhen a style went away too recently, it's because we had moved on,\u201d Deihl explains. \u201cBut after a certain time things get revalued.\u201d\n\nWithin hours of my personal scrunchie premonition, it became clear I hadn\u2019t been the only one at New York Fashion Week nudged to revalue the stretchy, puffy hair accessories. Fashion publications like Vogue and Harper\u2019s Bazaar devoted entire articles to Mansur Gavriel\u2019s scrunchies, which were made of vintage fabrics and would be available only at the brand\u2019s New York City boutique. (They\u2019ve long since sold out.) Mansur Gavriel is owned and run by two cool, young New Yorkers who already had one viral megahit under their belt; the brand\u2019s bucket bags had waiting lists that stretched for six months in the mid-2010s. The pair\u2019s blessing is exactly what a nascent, marginal trend needs in order to make its way to a broader audience.\n\nNot everyone loves the idea of the scrunchie\u2019s return. For the past two decades, it has been maligned as big, frilly, and objectionably retro-looking. Its opponents don\u2019t see any reason to change their views just because two hip designers decided the scrunchie is now cool. That attitude is typical of throwback fashion trends. While the nostalgic thrill is precisely the draw for some people, plenty of others who lived through bell-bottoms or baby-doll dresses the first time would love to leave those items in their past.", "description": "There\u2019s a reason the return of retro trends bothers so many people.", "authors": ["Amanda Mull"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/shutterstock_1145283458/facebook.jpg?1567656207", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
