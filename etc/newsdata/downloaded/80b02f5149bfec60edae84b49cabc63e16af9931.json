Hell, this thing could be a shell of a car without so much as a driver\u2019s seat or an engine inside, and I would\u2019ve signed up to buy four of them before I noticed.\n\nSell it, Hyundai. We dare you.\n\nHyundai calls the theme of this concept, which is no more than a concept for now and is headed to the SEMA show soon, \u201cfunctional ruggedness.\u201d\n\nBut ignore that branding term because it\u2019s silly and meaningless, while the Grappler itself certainly is not. SEMA is known for its ridiculous mods and vehicle displays, and a Veloster ready to take on the apocalypse fits right in.\n\nHyundai said in the release that the Grappler concept \u201cboasts increased ground clearance,\u201d which, duh, and that it\u2019s meant to take on \u201cunpredictable\u201d terrain \u2014 whatever that means. There are lights on top of lights, oversized all-terrain tires, a utility basket on the roof that\u2019s also a base mount for a removable solar panel, a carbon-fibre hood, a roll bar, and a full-size spare wheel and tire.\n\nThere are also a bunch of brands listed in the press release, along with barely decipherable phrases like \u201cvisceral audible resonance,\u201d because this is, at the end of the day, a branding exercise. But a nice branding exercise it is, because I don\u2019t often look at brand-new cars in the year 2019 and think, \u201cI\u2019ll take four.\u201d\n\nSadly, there is only this one photo so far, but we\u2019re holding out to see more.\n\nBut good on you, Hyundai, for creating something that I, a person who is too frugal to turn on lights at home during the night despite running into walls on occasion, would likely buy four of, dealership markups and all.\n\nIf only you\u2019d put it into the lineup.", "description": "I hadn\u2019t even begun reading the news release on this Hyundai Veloster Grappler concept before deciding, unequivocally, that Hyundai can take my money.
