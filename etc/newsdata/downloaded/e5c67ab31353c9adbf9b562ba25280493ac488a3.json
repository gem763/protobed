REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nThe deal represents a stunning reversal of fortune for WeWork as well as its largest shareholder, SoftBank, which has committed more than $13 billion in equity to a company that is now valued at just $8 billion.\n\nThe bailout comes as SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is seeking to convince investors to participate in the Japanese company\u2019s second mammoth Vision Fund, for which he is seeking to raise $108 billion.\n\nTo stem WeWork\u2019s bleeding, SoftBank will need to reverse its widening losses and find a way to make it profitable.\n\nThe rescue financing also marks a dramatic fall from grace for Neumann, who as recently as last month was preparing to take WeWork public as chief executive after attaining a $47 billion valuation for it in January.\n\nWhile WeWork employees now face the prospect of thousands of layoffs, Neumann has secured a $685 million side deal with SoftBank to step down from the board of WeWork\u2019s owner, The We Company, according to people familiar with the arrangement\n\nNeumann faced margins calls on his personal borrowings against WeWork\u2019s private stock as a result of the collapse of the company\u2019s valuation.\n\nSoftBank has agreed to extend to him a $500 million loan to repay a credit line from JPMorgan Chase & Co, as well as pay him a $185 million fee for a four-year assignment as a consultant to WeWork, one of the sources said.\n\nNeumann had drawn down on $395 million on JPMorgan\u2019s credit line, another of the sources added. Under the terms of the deal with SoftBank, he must use the proceeds of selling his stock to first repay the loan extended to him by SoftBank, according to the source.\n\nEven though he will give up his board seat, Neumann will get two representatives on WeWork\u2019s board, according to one of the sources.\n\nReuters first reported on Monday that Neumann was negotiating stepping down from the board and would serve as an adviser.\n\n\u201cThe consulting arrangement is mind boggling. It\u2019s terrible governance,\u201d said Nell Minow, vice chair of shareholder advisory firm ValueEdge Advisors. \u201cWhy pay the guy who got WeWork into this mess for advice. It\u2019s adding insult to injury and a little more injury too.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, some WeWork investors said they supported the deal.\n\n\u201cAdam is a visionary who has created an impactful company which has transformed the way many people work, live and think. We think he deserved to take some money off the table for his contribution to the company,\u201d said All Blue Capital managing partner Matt Novak. He declined to say how big his firm\u2019s stake in WeWork is.\n\nSoftBank said will it provide a $5 billion debt package to WeWork, comprising of $1.1 billion in senior secured notes, $2.2 billion in unsecured notes, and a $1.75 billion letter of credit facility. WeWork picked SoftBank\u2019s offer over an alternative $5 billion debt package submitted on Monday by JPMorgan.\n\nRelated Coverage SoftBank shares fall as WeWork deal adds to financial strains\n\nSoftBank said it will also accelerate a previous $1.5 billion equity commitment to WeWork in the form of warrants that are due in April at a new price of $11.60 per share.\n\nSoftBank added it will launch by the end of the year a tender offer for up to $3 billion to acquire WeWork shares from existing investors and employees at a price of $19.19 per share.\n\nNeumann\u2019s ability to tender his shares will be capped at $970 million, one of the sources said. He currently owns a little over a fifth of WeWork, and is expected to retain a stake.\n\nSoftBank said it will own 80% of WeWork following the tender offer, but will not be consolidating the company on its books because it will not hold a majority of voting rights.\n\nSoftBank and its first $100 billion Vision Fund already own about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $10.6 billion.\n\nAll of the Vision Fund\u2019s interests in regional joint ventures with WeWork outside of the Japan will be exchanged for shares in WeWork at $11.60 per share, SoftBank said.\n\n\u201cWe hope Softbank can execute on this enhanced vision, through leveraging its strategic partnerships, or otherwise, and bring back value to WeWork\u2019s minority shareholders,\u201d said All Blue Capital\u2019s Noval, adding his firm will be holding on to its stake because it views SoftBank\u2019s tender offer price as too low.\n\nWeWork abandoned its initial public offering last month, after investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way it was being run by Neumann, who gave up his CEO title last month. He had retained his position as chairman of the We Company.\n\nSoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure will succeed Neumann and become The We Company\u2019s executive chairman.\n\n\u201cThe new capital SoftBank is providing will restore momentum to the company and I am committed to delivering profitability and positive free cash flow,\u201d Claure said in a statement.\n\nArtie Minson, previously WeWork\u2019s chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, who was a vice chairman at the company, are now serving as its co-chief executives.\n\nPOOR GOVERNANCE\n\nWhile Neumann\u2019s investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities since co-founding WeWork in 2010, his free-wheeling ways and party-heavy lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company\u2019s IPO underway.\n\nDuring the attempts to woo IPO investors last month, Neumann was criticized by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares.\n\nThese included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donated to charitable causes. Neumann had also entered into several transactions with WeWork, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nNeumann, 40, is not the first founder of a major startup to be forced to step down recently. Uber Technologies Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned as CEO of the ride-hailing startup in 2017 after facing a rebellion from his board over a string of scandals, including allegations of enabling a chauvinistic and toxic work culture.\n\n\u201cI view this as SoftBank\u2019s moonshot to get WeWork back on all fours,\u201d said Eric Talley, professor of law at Columbia Law School. \u201c\n\n\u201cThey realize that Neumann\u2019s continued involvement in the company would be a continued impediment to that.\u201d", "description": "SoftBank Group Corp agreed to spend more than $10 billion to take over U.S. office-space sharing startup WeWork on Tuesday, doubling down on an ill-fated investment and paying off its co-founder Adam Neumann to relinquish control.", "authors": ["Anirban Sen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443954906&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M04F", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
