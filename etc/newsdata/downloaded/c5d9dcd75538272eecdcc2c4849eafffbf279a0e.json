They\u2019re turned off by default, but if you\u2019re a heavy Gmail user you can turn them on to make going through your inbox a bit more efficient.\n\nFor instance, once enabled, Shift+I can make a message as read, # can delete it, and Shift+C can start a new message in a new window. The shortcuts can be super useful (we even rounded up a ton of our favourites here) as long as you actually use them.\n\nPicking up a new habit like using shortcuts can take a little bit of an adjustment to get used to. KeyRocket is a Chrome extension that can help.\n\nThe extension pays attention to what you\u2019re doing in Gmail and then subtly reminds you when you could have used a keyboard shortcut in a situation where you chose to use mouse clicks and the like instead.\n\nIf you\u2019re just getting to use shortcuts, then the extension can be a helpful way for you to remind yourself as you go what shortcuts are available so you can use them in the future.\n\nAnd if you didn\u2019t know Gmail had shortcuts in the first place, you can turn those on by going into the Settings menu of Gmail and scrolling down to the \u201cKeyboard Shortcuts\u201d menu within the General tab.", "description": "Did you know that Gmail has a ton of built-in shortcuts?
