In fact, we've been seeing Joker portrayals for more than 50 years at this point, and as good as Phoenix's performance might be, both he and Phillips have continued to say that the movie is a one-off. So that means within the next few years, there will probably be yet another Joker, for Robert Pattinson's newly-cast Batman to face off against. Can't have a Batman without a Joker, right?\n\nBut for that being said, it's important for us to reflect on the various Jokers that we've seen through the years. Some, of course, are better than others. Where will Phoenix fall? We'll see once the dust settles.
