But she managed to find time in her busy schedule to announce the following:\n\nToday is International Pronoun Day which is particularly important to people who identify as transgender or gender non-conforming. Being misgendered can have a huge impact on somebody and their personal wellbeing. It also can be used as a form of abuse for somebody and that just isn\u2019t right. Today is about raising awareness, getting people to have conversations and understanding why it is so important to understand the pronouns that somebody wishes to be used.\n\nI suspect that thanks to Cooke\u2019s video people are indeed having \u2018conversations\u2019. But I doubt that many of these conversations concern which pronouns to use on someone who was born a man but thinks he\u2019s a girl, or vice versa.\n\nRather, I think these conversations might be including one or two of these questions:\n\nHow does this woman\u2019s BSc Honours Degree in Transport Management and Law \u2013 from an establishment so lowly she won\u2019t even name it on her CV \u2013 qualify her to lecture anyone on at all on the correct usage of pronouns?\n\nWhy is this woman appearing in police uniform, in front of a police logo, in order to proselytise on behalf of a niche, identity politics movement which is anathema to the vast majority of people she is supposed to serve?\n\nGiven that we are paying this woman \u00a3124,000 \u2014 plus benefits \u2014 out of our hard-earned taxed income, is there anyone, anywhere who believes that we are getting value for money?\n\nThe post of Deputy Chief Constable means that this woman is being groomed for the very highest roles in policing. Why?\n\nWhat is the point of the police if it insists on focusing on niche left-wing political issues at the expense of dealing with real crime?\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel: we know you hate all this nonsense. So when are you going to stop it happening?", "description": "Today is International Pronouns Day.
