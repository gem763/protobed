Using Microsoft\u2019s Wireless Display app, you can easily output the games from your Xbox One to your Windows 10 PC screen. Conversely, it\u2019s possible to stream what\u2019s on your PC to the TV that you\u2019re using with your Xbox One \u2014 you can even control it from the Xbox One console. Getting it set up is surprisingly simple.\n\nOne note, though: This is a wireless-only feature. Because the app uses Miracast to stream the content from your PC, you\u2019ll need to make sure that both the Windows 10 PC and Xbox One are on the same Wi-Fi network.\n\nHow to stream your PC to your Xbox One\n\nAny Windows 10 PC that can connect to Wi-Fi will support casting to a wireless display, but you\u2019ll need to download a free app for the Xbox One.\n\nNavigate on the console to the Microsoft Store (or simply click this link) and download the Wireless Display app.\n\nOnce the app is installed on the console, open it up. It will display a message saying that your console is now ready to be connected to your PC. The app also mentions a very helpful hint to keep in mind: the controller can switch between gamepad and keyboard / mouse control modes by pressing the menu and view buttons (the two buttons beneath the backlit Xbox logo on the controller).\n\nHead over to your PC. Once you\u2019re ready to stream some content, press the keyboard combo Windows + P. Alternatively, you can click the bottom right corner to open the Action Center, then click on Quick Actions. Either way, the next screen will show your console\u2019s name.\n\nFrom here, you can choose to extend what\u2019s on your PC monitor, duplicate it, or set the display on the Xbox One as your second screen. For my purposes, I set it as a duplicate so that my Xbox One display mirrored my PC monitor.\n\nOnce you\u2019re connected, you\u2019ll see a small, movable task bar located at the top of your PC monitor and your wirelessly connected TV. This lets you adjust the quality setting (accessible by clicking the gear) between gaming, working, or movie modes. During testing, it was tough to discern the difference in visual quality between the three. I found the gaming setting is best if you\u2019re solely playing PC games, as it has the least noticeable latency while using a controller.\n\nOne tip: if you\u2019ve got better-sounding audio connected to your TV, you can switch the audio to output there instead of your PC.\n\nTap the speaker icon on the Windows task bar.\n\nSelect \u201cDigital Output [your Xbox One\u2019s name here]\u201d\n\nFinally, Microsoft claims that you cannot use the Wireless Display app to display what it deems to be \u201cprotected content.\u201d So, any encrypted video content from apps like Netflix or Hulu won\u2019t work. However, I was able to stream anything I wanted through the Google Chrome browser. If you\u2019re running into trouble trying to get your movie or TV shows from Netflix or Hulu to appear, I\u2019d suggest downloading those apps for Xbox One instead.", "description": "If you own a Windows 10 PC and an Xbox One, a free app from Microsoft can assist you in wirelessly streaming PC games straight to your console over Wi-Fi.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1SvKn2hYr46H1icTUOhb2SzsdI=/0x356:4960x2953/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19214739/controlxbox.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
