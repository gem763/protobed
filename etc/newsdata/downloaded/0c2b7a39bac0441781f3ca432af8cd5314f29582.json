Another Dem Candidate Went Further.", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-03", "text": "Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden told reporters on Labor Day that he wanted a ban on all firearms that have magazines capable of holding \u201cmultiple bullets.\u201d While that position appeared to be one of the most extreme gun-control proposals among the Democratic field, Marianne Williamson outdid him.\n\nFirst, what Biden argued.\n\nWhile in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Labor Day, Biden criticized President Trump for not doing more to address gun violence in the country. He also took aim at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott because new laws that loosened gun restrictions went into effect the day after the mass shooting in Odessa and Midland, Texas, which left seven dead and more than 20 injured.\n\n\u201cOn dealing with firearms, it is irrational with \u2014 all due respect for the governor of Texas \u2014 on the very day you see a mass shooting and we\u2019re talking about loosening access to have guns being able to take them places of worship, store it in school, and it\u2019s absolutely irrational. It\u2019s all about special interests and it has to stop,\u201d he said.\n\n\"The idea that we don\u2019t have elimination of assault type weapons, magazines that can hold multiple bullets in them, it's absolutely mindless,\" he added. \u201cIt\u2019s no violation of the Second Amendment. It\u2019s just a bow of special interests of the gun manufactures and the NRA.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden wants to ban \u201cmagazines that hold multiple bullets\u201d\n\n\n\nThat would ban nearly every gun in America - including a majority of pistols\n\n\n\nThese are the people coming for your guns:\n\n\n\nZero understanding of how they work but never in doubt of their views pic.twitter.com/OHZYV0r6NP \u2014 Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 3, 2019\n\nObviously, The Constitution literally does not matter to these communists who wan to take over our country.\n\n\n\nDefeat them. https://t.co/BB3O7zD16y \u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 3, 2019\n\nWhy stop there? Williamson sure didn't.\n\nWriting in the Washington Post on Monday, the author called for a bullet ban.\n\n\"Of course, we need universal background checks; we need to close all loopholes; we need to outlaw bump stocks; and we need to outlaw assault weapons and the bullets needed to shoot them,\" she wrote.", "description": ".09/03/2019 19:37:49PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/d8099d95-f0ab-4d77-8def-340d6bc53f2d.png"}
