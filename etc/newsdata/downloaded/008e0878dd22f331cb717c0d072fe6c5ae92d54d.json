Playing comic Rudy Ray Moore onstage, he needled a member of the audience, then asked where he came from. The man, an extra, improvised: \u201cYour mama\u2019s house!\u201d\n\nEveryone on set roared (\u201cAwwwww!\u201d) and Murphy lit up, in character, unleashing insults, telling the guy he was the type \u201cwho would fart in the tub and turn around and bite the bubbles\u201d.\n\nIn an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the movie premiered to glowing reviews last month, Murphy, 58, describes the scene, acting out all the parts, sounding delighted. \u201cIt was a line I had heard Rudy say,\u201d he explains about the insult, \u201cbut still, it felt like a real moment with a heckler.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNext to him was the film\u2019s director, Craig Brewer, who adds that after the scene had ended and the star had left for a costume change, he looked around at his cast and marvelled: \u201cDo you know what we just saw?\u201d Brewer paused, sounding more fan than collaborator. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it. We just saw it.\u201d\n\nWhat they saw was something that has been sorely missing from popular culture for more than three decades: Eddie Murphy, one of the funniest people to ever tell jokes into a microphone, doing stand-up. Over the years, Murphy has teased fans with talk of a comeback, but this time, inspired by Dolemite, he appears to mean it. He signed a deal with Netflix to put out a new special next year, and has a theatre tour lined up, which means he could be in clubs working out jokes soon.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to just pop back up,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted a funny movie to remind them that they liked me. This movie turned out so strong that I figured this is a great way to come back.\u201d\n\nHis return to stand-up will be part of a broader reboot of the decade that made Murphy a star. In December, two months after the US theatrical premiere of Dolemite (it moves to Netflix on 25 Oct), he\u2019s hosting Saturday Night Live, for the first time since 1984 (before that he was a cast member for four years). And 30 years later, Murphy is working on a sequel, also directed by Brewer, to his 1988 hit Coming to America with the original characters. \u201cI\u2019m kind of looking at this period as a bookend,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been back to SNL. Let\u2019s fix that. Let\u2019s do stand-up again. That way, when I finally just sit on the couch, then it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nReferring to his most recent movie, a sober, uplifting drama from 2016, he added. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sit on the couch after Mr Church.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how big an impact Murphy made in the 1980s. In two specials, Delirious and Raw, performed, famously, in leather suits, he became the most influential stand-up of his generation. Besides entering the discussion of who is the greatest cast member in the history of Saturday Night Live and injecting a cutting racial consciousness into a show that lacked it, his dynamic presence arguably saved SNL from cancellation when it was struggling after the original stars left.\n\nIn the meantime, he became one of the biggest movie stars in the world after a string of blockbuster comedies (48 Hrs, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop) fuelled by his singular charisma. Replace Murphy with anyone else in Beverly Hills Cop, the third-highest-grossing comedy of all time, and it\u2019s probably a flop.\n\nBut even these credits don\u2019t entirely capture his singular success. It\u2019s difficult for a comic to be funny and sexy or funny and sweetly innocent, but nearly impossible to pull off this trick at the same time, as he did in seminal bits like the one about kids excited over the ice cream truck. No one killed like Murphy did in the 1980s. When I saw Raw in Washington as a teenager, the audience laughed so loudly that the people running the theatre actually turned the movie off and asked us to be quieter.\n\nIt\u2019s an intimidating legacy to live up to, particularly when you feel a bit alienated from the cackling, strutting star who defined a certain kind of wise guy cool. For when Murphy is flipping channels on television and stumbles across Raw, he cringes. The cocky jokes about women and relationships remind him, he says, of a break-up he was going through back then. \u201cI was a young guy processing a broken heart, you know, kind of an a**hole,\u201d he said.\n\nWearing a plush zip-up jacket with sunglasses hanging off the front, Murphy leaned back and shifted from a cool monotone to a comic impression of himself watching Raw as a snooty prude. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit much, my goodness,\u201d he says, cracking up, then shifting again, taking his voice down an octave to register a hint of moral disapproval: \u201cMy word.\u201d\n\nWith alacrity he returns to the measured voice of Murphy, unflappable superstar, recognising that what is a portrait of a place and time for him means something altogether different to everyone else. \u201cIt\u2019s forever,\u201d he says quietly in what might be considered a verbal shrug.\n\nMurphy describes himself now as a completely different person than he was back then, but spending an hour with him argues otherwise. He remains blindingly quick on his feet and an ingenious, hilarious mimic who can summon a big top of characters in seconds. With a soft voice and laid-back manner, he can seem remote, until he switches into a character, which he does often; raising his volume and intensity, he commits, firmly in the moment.\n\nAs is clear from his performance in Dolemite, one of his finest, Murphy\u2019s star power is undiminished. But there\u2019s a new tenderness and mature vulnerability in this role that also comes out in person. Asked how his sense of humour has changed, he concedes: \u201cI\u2019m mushier than I used to be.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 30 times things went wrong on film and TV sets Show all 30 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

It's not as glamorous as it sounds,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don't. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, 'What is it?' And they said, 'You look like you've been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.\u201d 2/30 Various cast \u2013 Jaws 2 During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn\u2019t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point. 3/30 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren \u2013 Rocky IV The fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It\u2019s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week. MGM/UA/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock 4/30 Marlon Brando \u2013 The Godfather Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s mafia film. It didn\u2019t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000. Rex Features 5/30 Gucci Mane \u2013 Spring Breakers In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine\u2019s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco\u2019s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.\u201d In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. \u201cI had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o'clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o'clock.\u201d Getty Images 6/30 Tom Cruise \u2013 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: \u201cI knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn\u2019t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, \u2018It\u2019s broken. That\u2019s a wrap. Take me to hospital\u2019 and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.\u201d PA 7/30 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen \u2013 Masters of Sex Caplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. \u201cAnd we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell \u201cCut\u201d and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.\u201c Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn't know that. She said: \u201dMy whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I'm a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that\u2019s just the way it's going to be.\u201d Showtime 8/30 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley \u2013 The Vampire Diaries Nina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley's finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries. Dobrev, who plays Elena Gilbert, falls in love with the good-natured vampire Stefan Salvatore (Wesley) in the supernatural teen drama TV series. But they certainly weren\u2019t expecting any injuries at work that day. In an interview, Wesley said: \u201cBeing the not-suave guy that I am, my thumb got bent back in a romantic scene where I slowly lowered Nina onto a bed. I was out of commission for a week.\u201d Rex Features 9/30 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of Grey Obviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a \u201cwee bag\u201d to protect his modesty, said: \u201cI got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.\u201d 10/30 Michael Imperioli \u2013 Goodfellas Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese\u2019s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds. Getty 11/30 Bill Murray \u2013 Groundhog Day During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a divorce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: \u201cBill said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I'm going to learn sign language.\u2019 And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That\u2019s anti-communication, you know? Let\u2019s not talk.\u201d Alamy Stock Photo 12/30 Lena Dunham \u2013 Girls It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: \u201cI stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There\u2019s not one guy who works on that show who hasn\u2019t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don\u2019t care.\u201d HBO 13/30 Kurt Russell \u2013 The Hateful Eight In one scene of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell\u2019s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting \u201cMusic time is over\u201d. As a result, the Martin Museum \u2013 which called the guitar a \"priceless, irreplaceable artefact\" \u2013 vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again. Moviestore Collection 14/30 Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore \u2013 Maps to the Stars The Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg\u2019s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore\u2019s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. \u201cI sweat like a f***ing crazy person,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, 'Are you having a panic attack?' It was so embarrassing.\u201d 15/30 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other Drugs Hathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. \u201cI have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!\u201d Getty Images 16/30 Edward James Olmos - Battlestar Galactica In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos\u2019s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000. 17/30 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During Wartime During a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey's co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. \u201cWe had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said \u2018Action\u2019 and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I'll never forget.\u201d Getty Images 18/30 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-Up The Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. \u201cIn the scene, she\u2019s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she\u2019s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I\u2019ve done.\u201d (Photo credit should read ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images) 19/30 Sean Connery and Lana Turner \u2013 Another Time, Another Place Sean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner\u2019s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend\u2019s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner\u2019s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US \u2013 but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide. Getty Images 20/30 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking Dead The long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered \u2013 but then as they were \u201chumping\u201d, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: \u201cThen we just started laughing, because it's ridiculous. It's two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.\u201d 21/30 Mel Brooks - Blazing Saddles During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn\u2019t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates. Getty 22/30 Christopher Mintz-Plasse - Superbad Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, \u201cIt\u2019s in. Oh, my God, it\u2019s in.\u201d \u201cShe got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,\u201d Mintz-Plasse said. \u201cAfterwards we didn't talk about it; we still don't speak about that moment.\u201d 23/30 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone \u2013 The Specialist Stallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. \u201cOk. Let it be known, I didn\u2019t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won\u2019t take it off. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t take any liberties, so what\u2019s the problem? She said, \u2018I\u2019m just sick of nudity.\u2019 I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else\u2019s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.\u201d 24/30 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard \u2013 The Legend of Tarzan Apparently Robbie \u2013 who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. \u201cI didn\u2019t injure Alexander,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he\u2019s a pretty strong guy. He can take it.

She's basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.\u201d He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not great when you\u2019re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?\u201d Getty Images 26/30 Jesse Metcalfe \u2013 Desperate Housewives It\u2019s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria\u2019s Gabrielle Solis. He said: \u201cWe were rehearsing and then the director was like, 'OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set', and I was like, 'I need a minute.'\u201c He added: \u201cIt doesn't happen that frequently\u201d because \u201dthere are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.\" 27/30 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes \u2013 The Princess Bride When you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner\u2019s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was \u201cmessing around\u201d between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant\u2019s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. \u201cI was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes \u2013 you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).\u201d Sony Pictures Entertainment 28/30 John Malkovich \u2013 Being John Malkovich The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting \u201cHey Malkovich, think fast!\u201d Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role. Universal Pictures 29/30 Viggo Mortensen \u2013 The Lord of the Rings When Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor.

She said: \u201dMy whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I'm a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that\u2019s just the way it's going to be.\u201d Showtime 8/30 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley \u2013 The Vampire Diaries Nina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley's finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries. Dobrev, who plays Elena Gilbert, falls in love with the good-natured vampire Stefan Salvatore (Wesley) in the supernatural teen drama TV series. But they certainly weren\u2019t expecting any injuries at work that day. In an interview, Wesley said: \u201cBeing the not-suave guy that I am, my thumb got bent back in a romantic scene where I slowly lowered Nina onto a bed. I was out of commission for a week.\u201d Rex Features 9/30 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of Grey Obviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a \u201cwee bag\u201d to protect his modesty, said: \u201cI got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.\u201d 10/30 Michael Imperioli \u2013 Goodfellas Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese\u2019s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds. Getty 11/30 Bill Murray \u2013 Groundhog Day During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a divorce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: \u201cBill said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I'm going to learn sign language.\u2019 And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That\u2019s anti-communication, you know? Let\u2019s not talk.\u201d Alamy Stock Photo 12/30 Lena Dunham \u2013 Girls It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: \u201cI stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There\u2019s not one guy who works on that show who hasn\u2019t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don\u2019t care.\u201d HBO 13/30 Kurt Russell \u2013 The Hateful Eight In one scene of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell\u2019s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting \u201cMusic time is over\u201d. As a result, the Martin Museum \u2013 which called the guitar a \"priceless, irreplaceable artefact\" \u2013 vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.

It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore\u2019s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. \u201cI sweat like a f***ing crazy person,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, 'Are you having a panic attack?' It was so embarrassing.\u201d 15/30 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other Drugs Hathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. \u201cI have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!\u201d Getty Images 16/30 Edward James Olmos - Battlestar Galactica In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos\u2019s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000. 17/30 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During Wartime During a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey's co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. \u201cWe had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said \u2018Action\u2019 and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I'll never forget.\u201d Getty Images 18/30 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-Up The Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. \u201cIn the scene, she\u2019s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she\u2019s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I\u2019ve done.\u201d (Photo credit should read ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images) 19/30 Sean Connery and Lana Turner \u2013 Another Time, Another Place Sean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner\u2019s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend\u2019s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner\u2019s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US \u2013 but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide. Getty Images 20/30 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking Dead The long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered \u2013 but then as they were \u201chumping\u201d, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: \u201cThen we just started laughing, because it's ridiculous. It's two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.\u201d 21/30 Mel Brooks - Blazing Saddles During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn\u2019t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates. Getty 22/30 Christopher Mintz-Plasse - Superbad Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, \u201cIt\u2019s in. Oh, my God, it\u2019s in.\u201d \u201cShe got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,\u201d Mintz-Plasse said. \u201cAfterwards we didn't talk about it; we still don't speak about that moment.\u201d 23/30 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone \u2013 The Specialist Stallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. \u201cOk. Let it be known, I didn\u2019t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won\u2019t take it off. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t take any liberties, so what\u2019s the problem? She said, \u2018I\u2019m just sick of nudity.\u2019 I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else\u2019s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.\u201d 24/30 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard \u2013 The Legend of Tarzan Apparently Robbie \u2013 who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. \u201cI didn\u2019t injure Alexander,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he\u2019s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.\u201d Courtesy Everett Collection/REX/Shutterstock 25/30 Henry Cavill \u2013 The Tudors Cavill says he had to \u201capologise profusely\u201d after he got aroused on set, adding that \u201cIt had only happened to him once\u201d. \u201cA girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn't rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She's basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.\u201d He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. \u201cAll you\u2019re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.\u201d But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not great when you\u2019re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?\u201d Getty Images 26/30 Jesse Metcalfe \u2013 Desperate Housewives It\u2019s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria\u2019s Gabrielle Solis. He said: \u201cWe were rehearsing and then the director was like, 'OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set', and I was like, 'I need a minute.'\u201c He added: \u201cIt doesn't happen that frequently\u201d because \u201dthere are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.\" 27/30 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes \u2013 The Princess Bride When you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner\u2019s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was \u201cmessing around\u201d between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant\u2019s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. \u201cI was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes \u2013 you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).\u201d Sony Pictures Entertainment 28/30 John Malkovich \u2013 Being John Malkovich The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting \u201cHey Malkovich, think fast!\u201d Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role. Universal Pictures 29/30 Viggo Mortensen \u2013 The Lord of the Rings When Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet. Rex 30/30 The entire cast of Roar But whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall\u2019s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.\n\nHis new movie provides some evidence. Murphy \u2013 who came up with the idea, and the title, for the blaxploitation parody I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka, which Keenen Ivory Wayans eventually directed in 1988 \u2013 takes a much warmer, more reverent approach to Rudy Ray Moore, a star of the blaxploitation era. Ed Wood, Tim Burton\u2019s affectionate 1994 portrait of a B-movie auteur, was an inspiration. (They even hired the same screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.)\n\nMurphy saw Moore\u2019s 1975 cult hit, Dolemite, for the first time as a teenager, introduced to Moore\u2019s comedy by his older brother Charlie (who died in 2017 and to whom the new biopic is dedicated). The younger Murphy was impressed by its audaciousness even though he recognised its artistic flaws. Murphy\u2019s taste has always leaned towards the mainstream, and his heroes were Richard Pryor, Elvis and Bruce Lee. As a kid, he felt distraught when he was banished from watching West Side Story on TV with his family as punishment for misbehaving, he recalls and imitated himself in tears listening to \u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d through the wall.\n\nYet he said he had always had a soft spot for blaxploitation stars because it was so rare to find African Americans on screen. \u201cFlip Wilson was really the first black person we saw in the mainstream, and then Hollywood started making movies with us,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t spend a lot of money on them, so they\u2019re not these high-quality pictures. But black people, ourselves, we were just excited to see ourselves. We never felt like they were exploitation.\u201d\n\nWhile Murphy became a star as a teenager, Moore, in sharp contrast, was a struggling, overweight comic who needed to go outside the industry to find success, which didn\u2019t come until middle age.\n\nDolemite was his rhyming alter ego, sometimes called the godfather of rap, who specialised in kung fu and oddball put-downs. (\u201cYou insecure, no-business, rat-soup-eating\u201d so-and-so went one insult.)\n\nHis movies were filled with laughable mistakes (a boom mic enters the frame), and when he knocked out a bad guy with a kick, his leg barely got off the ground. This made Dolemite a perfect midnight movie, beloved by stoned college kids for generations.\n\nMurphy views Moore as satirising blaxploitation heroes in movies like Superfly and Shaft, not trying to be like them. \u201cI\u2019ve had this conversation with comedians all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re laughing at him, saying: \u2018Look how bad he is. He doesn\u2019t realise how bad this is.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018No, no, he knows this is funny.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce Murphy decided to return to stand-up, he also settled on hosting Saturday Night Live. He had stayed away from it for decades, upset over some jokes made at his expense, including one by David Spade, although he seems no longer bothered by it. He returned for the 40th anniversary special in a brief appearance without telling jokes. This time it should be different. \u201cI have to do Buckwheat,\u201d he says, also mentioning Gumby and his Mister Rogers parody, Mr Robinson, his best-known characters from that era.\n\nThe show has recently become the subject of controversy for hiring and then firing a cast member, Shane Gillis, after recordings of him making racist remarks on a podcast surfaced. Murphy, who has never owned a computer and describes himself \u201cas close as you can get to a technophobe\u201d, says he wasn\u2019t concerned about new scrutiny of his comedy. He has been criticised for jokes on his specials that talked about fear of contracting Aids from kissing gay men and used homophobic slurs; in the past, he cited such backlash as the reason he stopped doing stand-up.\n\nHe has also said stand-up stopped being fun. But now he regrets giving it up and once he returns, he said, he will never abandon it again.\n\n\u201cI went through all that stuff, so this is not scary,\u201d he says about controversies over jokes. He points out that he had been picketed and had also apologised for material about Aids that he now calls \u201cignorant\u201d before adding, on the subject of anxiety by comics today: \u201cAll this stuff they are talking about: \u2018Hey, welcome to the club.\u2019\u201d\n\nMurphy says he never stopped generating material and has even been feeding ideas for jokes into a tape recorder for three years. He speculated that he had probably 15 to 20 minutes of material already but thought that he would need eight months to develop an hour and a half. Expect some bits about parenting from the man who has eight children.\n\n\u201cI now have a whole lifetime of experiences to draw upon. There was a time when I was at the centre of everything, what I was doing, and how funny I was and how popular,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not at the centre. Now my kids are and everything revolves around them.\u201d\n\nOne thing you can be sure of about his stand-up: don\u2019t expect him to wear leather again. \u201cNah, man, you can\u2019t wear a leather suit at 58,\u201d he says.\n\nJumping in, Brewer adds that leather makes you sweat, to which Murphy says that he was an exception. \u201cIf you watched Raw or Delirious,\u201d he says, in the voice of a punctilious fact-checker, \u201cI don\u2019t sweat.\u201d\n\nMurphy still has swagger, that confidence which, as it happens, is a major theme of Dolemite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his greatest talent and the one that\u2019s hardest to nail,\u201d Murphy says of Moore\u2019s faith in himself.\n\nAsked if his confidence ever flags when he thinks about returning to the stage, Murphy shifts his gaze to make direct eye contact, saying he\u2019s as confident as he has ever been.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still Eddie,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe way I look at things and paint pictures with words, I\u2019m still that guy. I\u2019m still going to be what I was. And then some.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 New York Times\n\n\u2018Dolemite Is My Name\u2019 is out on Netflix on 25 October", "description": "In the middle of shooting a scene from the new biopic Dolemite Is My Name, Eddie Murphy went off-script.
