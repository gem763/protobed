Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, said Tuesday the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint about President Trump\u2019s behavior on a phone call with the president of Ukraine should be identified.\n\n\u201cThe question I keep coming back to is why we don\u2019t know who this individual is,\u201d Jordan said as he walked into another day of closed-door testimony from another Trump administration witness in an impeachment investigation led by Democrats.\n\nJordan said the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act affords protections to the whistleblower but not anonymity.\n\n\u201cHe has a right to protection, that is what the whistleblower statute says,\u201d Jordan told reporters. \u201cIt does not say anonymity.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California and fellow Democrats launched the impeachment inquiry after the whistleblower came forward with a secondhand account of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe whistleblower said the call was alarming, using words such as \u201cfrightening\u201d and \u201ccrazy,\u201d and that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Democrats and Joe Biden, reportedly in exchange for hundreds of millions in security aid.\n\nThe person, Jordan said, waited 18 days to file a complaint but first reported the information to Schiff\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we know who this individual is, and to determine the credibility he or she has, I think is a fundamental question,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nSchiff said Sunday the whistleblower testimony may not be needed, prompting Republicans to question whether Schiff wants to avoid more questions about the whistleblower\u2019s prior contact with Democrats before reporting his complaint to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.\n\nJordan challenged reporters who suggested the whistleblower needed to maintain anonymity and said the person should be identified because his complaint is the basis for the impeachment inquiry Democrats are conducting in an effort to unseat the president.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think the American people have a right to know the individual who started this process, to try to remove the president of the United States, 13 months before an election?\u201d Jordan asked reporters. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we need to know how all of this started?\u201d", "description": "Ohio Rep.
