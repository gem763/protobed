The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 28, 2019\n\nIt comes ahead of a vote in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon on whether to back the prime minister\u2019s plan for a December general election.\n\nHis election bid, to be made under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA), would require a two-thirds Commons majority \u2013 434 MPs \u2013 for a snap poll on Dec. 12.\n\nLabour\u2019s lack of support for the proposal means it is likely to be defeated.\n\nJohnson has already had two requests for an election refused, but the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party (SNP) have offered Johnson a way out of the deadlock.\n\nLib Dem leader Jo Swinson and the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford have put forward a tightly drafted bill that would grant an election on Dec. 9 \u2013 three days earlier than the prime minister\u2019s suggested polling date.\n\nThe draft law, currently scheduled for Tuesday\u2019s sitting, would require a simple majority of 320 MPs to support it in order to dissolve parliament \u2013 114 fewer than under the FTPA \u201csuper majority\u201d rules.\n\nWith the SNP and Lib Dems supporting the initiative, the bill is likely to pass even without Labour backing.\n\nDowning Street indicated it could be willing to support the pro-Remain parties\u2019 proposals in a possible compromise offer.\n\nA Number 10 source said if the government\u2019s request for an election was lost, \u201cwe will look at all options to get Brexit done including ideas similar to that proposed by other opposition parties.\u201d\n\nIf passed on Tuesday, the SNP-Lib Dem Bill is likely to achieve Royal Assent by Thursday and Parliament would be dissolved by the end of the week for the first December poll in almost a century.\n\nIts quick dissolution turnaround period would mean the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \u2013 the attempt to put Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal with the EU into law \u2013 would fail to pass before Halloween.", "description": "The decision comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares for a general election vote in the House Commons.", "authors": ["Assistant Political Editor", "Huffpost Uk"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db6b488210000023334b394.jpeg?cache=aziggzfqv5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
