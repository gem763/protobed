But that has done little to assuage fears in Mahra.\n\n\u201cPeople have a regional way of thinking,\u201d Qalab adds, his voice trailing off.\n\nYemen has been ravaged by a complex five-year proxy war since the Iran-backed Houthi rebels swept control of the country in 2014, ousting the recognised president Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.\n\nFearing the encroachment of Iran\u2019s influence on their borders, Riyadh and its Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, launched a bombing campaign to reinstate Mr Hadi.\n\nThe Gulf later trained up tens of thousands of local tribesmen, including southern separatists, in a bid to oust the Houthis and snuff out jihadi groups like Al-Qaeda and Isis.\n\nBut the plan appeared to backfire when UAE-trained forces loyal to the STC seized Aden in early August, ripping the anti-Houthi alliance apart. Since then dozens have been killed, including 25 civilians.\n\nThe STC wants a return to a separate South Yemen, a country comprised of six governorates, including Mahra, which existed from 1967 until the country was first unified in 1990.\n\nA war within a war is brewing with potentially devastating consequences for civilians.\n\nFive years of fighting has already sparked the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis with 24 million people, or two-thirds of the population, relying on aid to survive, according to the UN. A staggering 13 million are on the brink of famine. More than 70,000 people have died.\n\nBut a further 3.5 million people have also been displaced within the country, with more than 55,000 families forced to flee their homes since the start of the year alone.\n\nIt is not known how many of them made it to Mahra but according to figures quoted by the Sana\u2019a Centre for Strategic Studies, the population of the governorate may have nearly doubled since the start of the war, likely due to people fleeing to the region.\n\nThere are concerns that the number may rise as the battle for independence sweeps across the south of the country.\n\nThe STC is not welcome in Mahra, and so experts have warned of conflict on the horizon.\n\n\u201cMy comprehensive survey of over 2,000 Mahris in early 2013 revealed that only 13 per cent of Mahris wish to be part of a separate South Yemen. There is little reason to believe that this has changed,\u201d says Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen expert at Pembroke College, Oxford, who has travelled extensively across the country.\n\nIn fact, she says that two-thirds of people she interviewed in Mahra favoured their own independent state, even if it may not be practical.\n\nAnd this points to an entirely separate internal conflict within Mahra, which could further complicate matters for displaced and vulnerable northerners.\n\nMany powerful tribesmen within Mahra, which prides itself on a unique culture and language, are locked in a potentially deadly standoff with Saudi Arabia.\n\nSince late 2017, Riyadh began shuttling hundreds of troops to the area and trained up local forces to tackle rampant weapons smuggling through the porous border with Oman.\n\nDespite initially promising not to, Riyadh took over and shut down Mahra\u2019s civilian airport, turning it into a military headquarters. It unfurled a further five main bases, sparking alarm and outrage among the Mahri who accuse the Saudis of a land grab and an \u201coccupation\u201d.\n\nProtests have been fairly constant, and sporadic clashes have erupted between tribesmen and Saudi-affiliated forces.\n\nQalab, a school teacher, says the displaced have noticed tensions rising within Mahra.\n\nHe currently lives in rented accommodation after fleeing Hodeidah in December 2017, when his children were seconds from being wiped out by a rocket, which had landed on their house.\n\nHis family sold all the gold they had to make the perilous two-day journey through Yemen to Mahra, thinking they would only be gone \u201cfor a few months\u201d.\n\nLike thousands of government employees across Yemen, he has not been paid since 2018. It is even more complicated as he is on the payroll as a teacher for Hodeidah, on the other side of the country. The family rely on help from aid organisations and locals.\n\n\u201cMy daughter does henna for girls to earn some money, I teach for free in a local school and try to do private tuition, but it\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nHe dreads going back to Hodeidah where 20 of his relatives have been killed and fighting is still rumbling on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure all the displaced are worried about that, we are praying it doesn\u2019t get to that,\u201d he adds.\n\nA few kilometres away in Mahra\u2019s main hospital, which is run down and woefully low on supplies, more who fled the north wait with anxiety.\n\nSabah Said, 47, lies on a hospital bed with her sick 13-year-old, Rahma, in the newly constructed \u201ccholera ward\u201d, which, according to the hospital\u2019s doctors, mostly treats the internally displaced.\n\nThe \u201cward\u201d is a breeze-block half-built extension, with the acronym \u201cDTC\u201d, (Diarrhoea Treatment Centre) scrawled in permanent marker on a portable-building door.\n\nSabah says she fled Taiz, a western governorate, last year, when a missile took out their neighbour\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cWe just grabbed the children and ran, we couldn\u2019t take a single item with us,\u201d she adds.\n\nRahma is malnourished from cholera and a blood infection, and looks younger than her teenage years.\n\nIt was the only peaceful and stable corner of Yemen we could find, hopefully the fighting will not come to us Sabah Said, 47, mother-of-six who fled Taiz\n\n\u201cIt was the only peaceful and stable corner of Yemen we could find, inshallah the fighting will not come to us. We already feel there is no hope,\u201d the mother-of-six adds.\n\nPalestinian doctor Qassem Abed, 26, is one of the senior medics running the hospital, and says the centre was already struggling to cope with the influx of displaced people and the shortage of supplies. It is the main hospital in the province, which is Yemen\u2019s second largest.\n\n\u201cWe need equipment like CT, MRI scans, we need a lab. We have one incubator, we don\u2019t have morphine. We are low on antibiotics, the list goes on,\u201d the GP says, walking through the half-built centre.\n\n\u201cWe are worried that there will be more people coming since the fighting started in Aden, we already received more patients this year than last.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAnd if the fighting comes here it will be a disaster, we have no way to prepare for it.\u201d\n\nBack in the dusty outskirts of Ghaydah, Nagwa says the family is trying to press on as normal.\n\n\u201cWe prefer not to watch the news so as not to scare the kids,\u201d she says, walking through the tiny rooms, the younger children in tow like a cloud behind her.\n\n\u201cWe pray that everyone takes peaceful decisions, that everyone gets to live. Hopefully, the fighting ends soon. But, as with everything, God decides.\u201d", "description": "The Yemeni family live 45 people to just three rooms since their building shattered like glass when airstrikes pounded Hodeidah in late 2017.
