Elizabeth Warren is proposing new taxes on high-income Americans for the Social Security trust fund, making her the latest Democratic presidential hopeful looking to tap the coffers of the nation\u2019s top earners to extend the life of the program.\n\nThe proposal is less dramatic than some other plans being floated in the Democratic Party. House Democrats are debating whether to advance a significant expansion of Social Security that would make the program solvent for at least 75 years through a combination of tax increases, tax cuts and larger benefits. That plan would raise taxes on top earners as well as middle-income workers, unlike Ms. Warren\u2019s plan.\n\nOne of her main presidential rivals, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, earlier this year unveiled a bill that would make Social Security solvent until 2071. Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal is expected to keep the Social Security trust solvent until 2054, about 20 years more than is currently projected.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s plan, however, is different in that she is calling for a new 14.8% tax on net investment income that applies to individuals earning over $250,000 annually and families earning more than $400,000.\n\n\u201cThis contribution requirement will ensure that the very wealthy are paying into Social Security even when they report the bulk of their income as capital returns rather than wages,\u201d Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, said in a post on the website Medium.\n\nMoody\u2019s Chief Economist Mark Zandi, writing in a Thursday note analyzing Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, found that it would immediately lift 4.9 million seniors out of poverty by redistributing cash from high earners and boosting benefits.\n\n\u201cThe plan results in a much more progressive Social Security system, as high-income people shoulder the financial burden of the plan, while low- and middle-income people benefit substantially,\u201d Mr. Zandi wrote.\n\nMr. Zandi also wrote that weakening the link between the amount of taxes workers pay into the system and the benefit they receive could weaken the widespread political support Social Security has received historically. He argued that because Ms. Warren\u2019s Social Security plan as well as her proposal to forgive over $600 billion in student-loan debt impose substantially greater taxes on high-income and high-net-worth households, they could\u2014if implemented\u2014trigger \u201csignificant behavioral changes by these households that are difficult to gauge.\u201d\n\nConventional wisdom in Washington has long held that Social Security changes have to be bipartisan because of the political risks for Democrats in raising taxes and for Republicans in cutting future benefits. Republicans in Congress have criticized House Democrats for considering moving on their own.\n\nCurrently, employers and employees each pay 6.2% of wages up to $132,900, and that limit increases each year. In addition to the tax on investment income, the Warren plan raises revenue by imposing the payroll tax on wages above $250,000 at a higher rate than for lower-income workers. Employees and employers would each pay 7.4%\n\nThe bill introduced by Mr. Sanders sets a 12.4% contribution rate for wages above $250,000. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, fellow Democratic White House hopefuls, are co-sponsors of the Sanders effort.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s plan would boost Social Security benefits by $200 a month, or $2,400 a year, for every current and future Social Security beneficiary. Mr. Sanders\u2019 bill would increase benefits by about $1,342 a year for seniors making less than $16,000 a year.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden in July called for making Social Security more solvent, but he didn\u2019t outline a specific date. He also didn\u2019t offer specifics on how he would raise revenue but broadly called for \u201casking Americans with especially high wages\u201d to pay more.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s plan would alter a tax provision that Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, have used to lower their tax bill.\n\nThe Bidens routed their book and speech income through S corporations, according to tax returns the couple released earlier this year. They paid income taxes on those profits, but the strategy let the couple avoid the 3.8% self-employment tax they would have paid had they been compensated directly or treated the money as labor income instead of business profits through the S corporations.\n\nThe Journal previously reported that the tax savings were as much as $500,000, compared with what the Bidens would have owed if paid directly or if a proposal floated by the Obama administration had become law.\n\nWrite to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "description": "Sen.
