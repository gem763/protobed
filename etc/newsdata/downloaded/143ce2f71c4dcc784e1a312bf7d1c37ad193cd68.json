But they have now branded the cruise 'the worst trip ever'. Pictured: Tourists hold up placards saying 'we want refunds' and 'shame on you'\n\nThey claimed to be fearful for their health aboard the ship as toilets had begun to back up and food had gone stale after the ship spent numerous days at sea without being able to dock.\n\nMr McNutt told the Victoria Derbyshire show: 'We expected to have a good holiday and we've had the worst trip of our lives.\n\n'We missed five ports, we floated around the English channel for two days, the food was going bad, the toilet in our room stopped flushing.\n\n'We were luck that no one got sick really. Then riots broke out on the ship; they pulled out security and were threatening to arrest several passengers.'\n\nMs Jones added: 'We were about 15 minutes from docking in Greenock and they turned the boat around and lied to everyone, they just keep saying \"we are going to dock any minute\".\n\n'Half an hour after we were supposed to dock the captain came on and said we would not be docking today and there were a roar from all the people ready to get off the ship. They ad their coats and bags ready to go.'\n\nAmerican tourists Cody McNutt and Katasha Jones were among a horde of passengers to leave the ship at Belfast on Tuesday and return home early\n\nPassengers are seen being addressed by crew on the Norwegian Spirit. Tourists say the ship \u2013 which set off from Southampton on September 27 \u2013 failed to dock in Le Havre or Amsterdam, apparently because of high winds\n\nThe cruise's route: Blue shows where it travelled, red is where it should have gone via Iceland and the green shows the stages left to complete. It failed to dock at La Havre, Amsterdam, Reykjavik and Glasgow\n\nThe pair said they had spent $5,000 on their rooms aboard the ship but had decided to pay for new flights at a cost of $900 so they could leave the ship early.\n\nMr McNutt added: 'We were fearful for our health and safety on the ship. All of the food on the ship was five days old that they were serving people.\n\n'The ship smelled awful. I don't know if the sewers were backed up but you could walk down the hall and smell it.'\n\nMany passengers said food served in the restaurants had gone stale. There was further fury when US-based operator Norwegian Cruise Line declined full refunds and offered passengers only a 25 per cent voucher towards a future cruise.\n\nFootage shows hundreds of passengers protesting in the ship's grand atrium amid chants of 'shame on you', 'we want refunds' and 'get us off this ship'.\n\nThe passengers, including British, American and Chinese tourists, can be heard shouting 'take us back to London' in front of crew members and security guards.\n\nOne demanded: 'I want to see the captain. He should be out here.'", "description": "American tourists\u00a0Cody McNutt and Katasha Jones were among a horde of passengers to leave the ship at Belfast and return home early after it set off from Southampton last month.", "authors": ["Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/14/19541730-0-image-a-20_1570715303749.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
