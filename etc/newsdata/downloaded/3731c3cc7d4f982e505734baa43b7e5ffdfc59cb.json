(AP) - All that mattered to Aaron Rodgers on Sunday was that the Packers won.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nRodgers threw two early touchdowns and Green Bay held on for a 21-16 victory over the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is that we\u2019re 2-0,\u201d he said. \u201cI know we owe a lot of that to our defense and (defensive coordinator) Mike Pettine and his staff and those guys for being opportunistic and making plays when they had to. But I think there\u2019s still a lot of great potential in this offense.\u201d\n\nOn a day when the Packers honored late Hall of Famer Bart Starr at halftime, Rodgers put on quite a show - particularly early. Rodgers completed nine of his first 10 passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns and had a perfect 158.3 rating through the first quarter. He finished 22 of 34 for 209 yards.\n\nRodgers and new coach Matt LaFleur experimented with Rodgers wearing a playcall wristband in the hope that it would speed up the play-calling process and get the offense out of the huddle quicker.\n\n\u201cYeah, this is probably the wordiest offense I\u2019ve been in since Cal,\u201d said Rodgers, who played college ball at California after transferring from Butte Community College. \u201cI think it just helps with communication. He doesn\u2019t have to say 12 syllables to me, and then I say 12 syllables in the huddle. It helps speed things up a little bit. But we didn\u2019t use it a whole lot. We only used it about five or six times.\u201d\n\nAfter scoring on each of its first three possessions, Green Bay\u2019s offense failed to muster another point. But the hot start was enough to win.\n\nThe Packers remained unbeaten under LaFleur after opening the NFL\u2019s 100th season with a victory at rival Chicago. They also beat the Vikings (1-1) for the fifth time in the past seven games at Lambeau Field.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Dalvin Cook had a career-high 154 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. It was the third-year pro\u2019s second consecutive game with over 100 yards rushing. Cook also had 37 yards receiving in the loss.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to find our rhythm,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt was a hostile environment. We knew what we were coming into. Tried to prepare as well as we could. You can never replicate a game. Just trying to find our rhythm. We found it, but they jumped on us pretty early.\u201d\n\nAfter throwing the ball just 10 times in the opener against Atlanta, Kirk Cousins finished 14 of 32 with 230 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Cousins was picked off by Kevin King in the end zone late in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t do that, can\u2019t do that,\u201d Cousins said of the interception. \u201cIt happened last week in our game against us. We talked about it all week, you just can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s uncharacteristic of me.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings are 5-2-1 in last their eight meetings against Green Bay.\n\nRodgers and Davante Adams connected on a 39-yard completion on the Packers\u2019 first offensive play. Rodgers found running back Jamaal Williams for a 15-yard touchdown to cap a four-play, 75-yard drive.\n\nAdams finished with 106 yards on nine catches.\n\n\u201cWe started off a lot faster,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely what we were after this week.\u201d\n\nIt took Green Bay\u2019s offense all of 12 minutes to score more points (14) than it did in the season opener at Chicago (10).\n\nAfter a missed field goal by Minnesota, receiver Geronimo Allison, who did not see a single pass against the Bears, gave the Packers a two-score advantage on a 12-yard strike from Rodgers.\n\nGreen Bay took over at the Vikings 33 after defensive lineman Kenny Clark sacked Cousins, forcing a fumble. Dean Lowry recovered the loose ball.\n\nThe Packers took a commanding 21-0 lead with 2 minutes to play in the first half on 2-yard run by Aaron Jones.\n\n\u201cWe came out hot,\u201d said Jones, who finished with 116 yards on 23 carries. \u201cWe thought we could do no wrong. We\u2019ve just got to continue to work at it because the fourth drive, fifth drive, sixth drive, we want points on those as well.\u201d\n\nAfter rushing for 111 yards and two touchdowns in a win last week against the Falcons, Cook broke out for a 75-yard score following a missed tackle by rookie safety Darnell Savage.\n\n\u201cEventually one of us was going to make a play to get this game rolling, and it was just me that made a play,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWhatever to get a team rolling, to get this thing going, that was the play to do it.\u201d\n\nStefan Diggs scored the Vikings\u2019 other touchdown with a 45-yard grab with 9:12 to play in the third.\n\n\u201cDisappointing loss today,\u201d Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. \u201cWe fought hard, but we didn\u2019t play well enough to win. We had some dumb penalties. \u2026 The interception at the end of the ballgame hurt.\u201d\n\nMinnesota had eight penalties for 100 yards.\n\nINJURIES\n\nPackers: S Raven Greene was carted off the field with an ankle injury following the first play of the second half. He did not return.\n\nSTARR CELEBRATION\n\nThe Packers honored Starr during a celebration that included a video tribute, words from Starr\u2019s wife, Cherry, and an appearance by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nStarr, who died in May at 85, was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls and won the league MVP award in 1966 with the Packers. Starr has the highest postseason passer rating (104.8) of any QB in NFL history and a postseason record of 9-1. Starr was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Packers Hall of Fame in 1977.\n\nNEXT UP\n\nVikings: Host Raiders on Sept. 22.\n\nPackers: Host Broncos on Sept. 22.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "All that mattered to Aaron Rodgers on Sunday was that the Packers won.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/vikings_packers_football_28728_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
