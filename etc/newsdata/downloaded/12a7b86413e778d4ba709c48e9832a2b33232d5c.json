How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nWith Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce yielding 5.2% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce!\n\nTSX:CM Historical Dividend Yield, October 14th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. In the last year, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce paid out 48% of its profit as dividends. A medium payout ratio strikes a good balance between paying dividends, and keeping enough back to invest in the business. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's dividend payments. During this period the dividend has been stable, which could imply the business could have relatively consistent earnings power. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was CA$3.48 in 2009, compared to CA$5.76 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 5.2% per year over this time.\n\nCompanies like this, growing their dividend at a decent rate, can be very valuable over the long term, if the rate of growth can be maintained.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWhile dividend payments have been relatively reliable, it would also be nice if earnings per share (EPS) were growing, as this is essential to maintaining the dividend's purchasing power over the long term. Earnings have grown at around 7.1% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! It's good to see decent earnings growth and a low payout ratio. Companies with these characteristics often display the fastest dividend growth over the long term - assuming earnings can be maintained, of course.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo summarise, shareholders should always check that Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. We're glad to see Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has a low payout ratio, as this suggests earnings are being reinvested in the business. Earnings growth has been limited, but we like that the dividend payments have been fairly consistent. Overall we think Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is an interesting dividend stock, although it could be better.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSE:CM) a good dividend stock?
