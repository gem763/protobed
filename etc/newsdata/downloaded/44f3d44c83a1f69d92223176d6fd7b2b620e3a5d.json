After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n'To try and prove this, I came up with an idea, I blocked everyone from viewing Instagram except ONE account. '\n\nShe continued: '(Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while). Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.\n\nThe full statement: Coleen made these claims on Instagram after discovering she had been betrayed by someone close to her, concluding that it was Rebekah\n\nWag-atha Christie: Coleen tweeted these words back in January, highlighting how she has been trying to get to the bottom of who was leaking stories on her life for some time\n\n'And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flood in my new house.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's......... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\n'I don't need the money': Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after the post and said she had nothing to gain and had no financial motivation - she also slammed her for going public when she is heavily pregnant\n\nShocking: Rebekah has since hit out at trolls after being bombarded with vile messages on social media\n\nShe also wrote: 'This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it......'\n\nThe Sun has since removed their story about Coleen's basement flooding after discovering she had made it up.\n\nRebekah hit back minutes later on social media and denied the accusations. She wrote: 'Can't believe I'm even having to write this. I'm pregnant & on holiday & am at a loss to why she would do this.\n\n'I'm now having to take legal advice as I can't deal with this stress myself when I'm this pregnant.

Such a shame that Coleen didn\u2019t just call her when she had her number.'\n\nRebekah has since slammed trolls who have wished her unborn baby would die in the wake of her Coleen Rooney story leaking scandal.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Wednesday evening, the WAG, 37, shared a screenshot of an Instagram message sent to her by a follower who penned: 'F**k u dirty sly c**t I hope that baby dies within you B***H'.\n\nShe is understood to have ended her family holiday in the Emirates and flown back to the United Kingdom in a bid to prove her innocence.\n\nSources close to the WAG say she is preparing to hit back and is working with her lawyers to prove she had nothing to do with the leak.\n\nAn insider exclusively told MailOnline: 'Rebekah has been incredibly stressed and hasn\u2019t stopped sobbing all day, which is very out of character for her.\n\n'The whole situation has left her distraught and she still doesn\u2019t understand why Coleen didn\u2019t reach out to her first to ask her outright about the issue.\n\nClose friends only: This is believed to be Coleen's private account - which is separate to the one she shares with the public\n\n'She\u2019s flying home early from Dubai as she feels her time abroad has been spoilt and all she wants is to be surrounded by family.\n\n'Rebekah wants to prove she had nothing to do with the leaked stories and is working with a lawyer and IT experts who can look at the forensics of her Instagram, which several people have access to.'\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesman for Coleen said: 'It is irrefutable that the leaks came from one account, and one account only.'\n\nOn Thursday morning former WAG Lizzie Cundy told Channel 5 news that Coleen wouldn't have pointed the finger if she had any doubt.\n\nTalking from her home, Lizzie told broadcaster Claudia-Liza Armah about her friendship with both Coleen and Rebekah and said: 'Well, like everyone else, I am in total shock.\n\n'Coleen has been doing her detective work for a couple of years now. I know these stories about her have been repeatedly coming out in the press.\n\nDumbfounded: On Thursday morning former WAG Lizzie Cundy told Channel 5 news that Coleen wouldn't have pointed the finger if she had any doubt\n\nThe flip side: Host Claudia-Liza Armah made it clear that Vardy has denied the accusations and that other people do have access to her Instagram account\n\nLizzie said: 'I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that'\n\n'She really wanted to get to the bottom of it and she did. I know Coleen and I am friends with both. Coleen is very intelligent, very bright. I don't think she is given enough credit for that.\n\n'She is determined and wanted to know who is releasing these stories. Whether it's right to out someone in the way she did is another question, but it was really upsetting her and upsetting her family life.'\n\nLizzie said she admires the way Coleen found out the truth.\n\nPals: Lizzie, who knows Rebekah well, said she still can't believe this is something she would do\n\nShe said: 'She wanted to get to the bottom of it. It was a clever way to do it. I am one of the followers who follow her on her private Instagram.\n\n'And I did wonder what was going on as she had been very quiet. I've got such a busy life and I didn't see anything coming up - but I would have a flick through.'\n\nLizzie, who knows Rebekah well, said she still can't believe this is something she would do.\n\nShe said: 'I can't believe she would do this. What are the reasons? She doesn't need the money. She has got a wonderful lifetyle, a wonderful family. It just beggars belief.'\n\nNot supporting Vardy: A host of celebrities leaped to Coleen's defense and said they felt sorry for her\n\nClaudia made clear that Vardy has denied the accusations and that other people do have access to her Instagram account.\n\nShe asked Lizzie what Rebekah is really like and she replied: 'I love her. We were at the National Television Awards together. We have great fun.\n\n'She doesn't need the money, she doesn't need the fame. The only other reason is possibly to keep in with journalists and press by giving these stories.\n\n'I have to say, for Coleen to do this, she must have had concrete evidence, because there is no way she would put this on social media knowing it's going out to the world.\n\n'She wouldn't do this unless she knew 100%. Really, I just can't believe that Becky would do this. Coleen really feel she has done it.'\n\nClaudia added: 'Rebekah also follows two of the journalists who reportedly posted these stories.'\n\nLizzie replied: 'Well yeah she does. But she is in the public eye. There are a lot of journalists who follow me and I follow them.\n\n'I do a radio show with one of the top journalists in the country. It's part of our work. It doesn't mean she's guilty.'\n\nClapping hands: People were telling Coleen to 'go girl' after her post was released\n\nIn the midst of the controversy a host of celebrities took to social media to air their views on the matter - and most appeared to be taking Coleen's side.\n\nFellow former WAG Danielle Lloyd posted some rat emojis in the comments section of Coleen's post and even Wayne Rooney prostitute Helen Wood leaped to Coleen's defence.\n\nShe wrote: 'Probably shouldn\u2019t comment but going to anyway always said Rebekah Vardy was a snake in the grass hence why I\u2019m blocked her whole persona screamed it on the jungle. Sly eyes too.'\n\nShe also retweeted a post from Vardy from a fan who wrote: 'Rebekah Vardy really embarrassing herself with that reply to Coleen Rooney.'\n\nTV star Richard Osman wrote: 'I will vote for any political party who agree to immediately give us the rest of the day off so we can follow this Coleen Rooney/Rebekah Vardy thing properly.'\n\nAwkward: In 2017, Rebekah's ex-partner and father of one of her children, Luke Foster discussed her relentless quest for fame when he gave an interview with The Mirror , saying at the time: 'I'm glad I am shot of her'\n\nHousehold name: In 2017, she appeared on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! but was the third person to be voted off.

Rebekah is the least homophobic or malicious person I know so afraid your all very much mistaken. Good luck Mrs Vardy.'\n\nNot a nice thing to do: Rebekah previously had a one-night stand with singer Peter Andre in 2001 and has spoken about their relationship in the press, leaking a story to the News Of The World, saying he had a 'chipolata penis\n\nShe also headed out to Russia with the family to support husband Jamie in the 2018 World Cup.\n\nRebekah previously had a one-night stand with singer Peter Andre in 2001 and has previously spoken about their relationship in the press, saying he had a 'chipolata penis.'\n\nShe gave an interview to The News Of The World about the fling, saying Peter was 'the worst lover' she'd ever had.\n\nAdding: 'He had great muscles and I thought he'd be a great lover.

This is all about becoming famous.

She's got the shopping, the house, the car. She's living her perfect life.\n\n'Becky upgraded. She said that to my face. She said he'd treat her a hell of a lot better.'\n\nThe couple split in 2013 and three months later Becky and Jamie were expecting their first child together - she is now expecting her third child with the footballer.\n\nWarning: It's understood that Wayne told Vardy to make sure Rebekah didn't provide a distraction with her social media posts\n\nIt was previously claimed that Coleen's husband had 'warned' Jamie about Rebekah in England showdown talks in 2016, when they both represented England at the European Championships in France.\n\nWayne and Jamie were both part of the England squad at Euro 2016 as the Three Lions were dumped out by minnows Iceland in one of the greatest international shocks in their history.\n\nThe Times claimed Rooney told Vardy to make sure Rebekah didn't provide a distraction with her social media posts.\n\nOld times: Despite his fears, England crashed out of Euro 2016 after losing to minnows Iceland\n\nShe had earlier hit out at French police for treating England fans 'like animals'.\n\nEx England boss Roy Hodgson was forced to deny reports that Rooney and Vardy had fallen out during the Euro 2016 tournament.\n\nHodgson said: 'I haven't got a clue what you are referring to. There are absolutely no problems in football terms between Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy.\n\n'In fact quite the reverse, they are very close friends, both on the field and off the field. I have got no idea what you are referring to\n\n'I certainly would advise Wayne to give no comment to it because it is obviously one salacious story that someone has managed to spin. It is of no interest to us.'", "description": "The Leicester City striker has maintained a stoic social media silence following Coleen's extraordinary claim that his wife has sold stories about to a national news outlet.", "authors": ["Jason Chester", "Rebecca Davison", "Sarah Packer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/10/19531900-0-image-a-104_1570699804290.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
