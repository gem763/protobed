Ilhan Omar \u2014 and he doubled down even after being told it\u2019s false.\n\nNorth Dakota state Sen. Oley Larsen claimed on Facebook Monday that a black and white photo of a woman holding a rifle and wearing a headscarf was Omar, who he falsely said was pictured at an \u201cAl Qaida training camp in Somalia.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is trying to get this picture blocked,\u201d Larsen wrote alongside the photo. \u201cShare it everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe problem? The Associated Press took that photo in Mogadishu on Feb. 25, 1978 \u2014 four years before Omar, the first Muslim refugee elected to the U.S. Congress, was born.\n\nThe Grand Forks Herald first reported that Larsen had posted the photo.\n\nOmar responded to Larsen on Monday night, referring to his post as \u201cpure propaganda.\u201d She also slammed Facebook for its infamous unwillingness to remove false posts from the site.\n\n\u201cThis is pure propaganda designed to stir up hate and violence coming from a GOP state rep,\u201d Omar wrote on Twitter Monday night. \u201cFacebook's unwillingness to crack down on hate speech and misinformation is not just threatening my life but our democracy.\u201d\n\nLarsen has since taken down the post, though he did not respond to requests for comment from Port or the Washington Post.\n\n\n\nBut in another comment on his Facebook page, which has also since been deleted, Larsen doubled down on the falsehood, and wrote that he is \u201cbegging to let everyone know [Omar] is an elected terrorist.\u201d\n\nElected Republicans, including President Trump, have routinely lobbed racist conspiracy theories about Omar, including that she married her brother to help him obtain permanent residency in the U.S.\n\nIn fact, Omar has previously been forced to address the photo in question because of its ubiquity among conspiracy theorists online. In August, Omar tweeted, \u201cReally feel sorry for the people at \u2066\u2066@snopes\u2069, fact checking outrageous claims like this must suck! It seems like you can make any kind of dangerous, disgusting and disturbing claim against me and have it get traction.\u201d\n\nAnd earlier this year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to request additional security for Omar because of the threats to her life.\n\n\n\nCover: North Dakota state Sen.
