He tentatively planted himself in front of her and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry your mother lost.\u201d Clinton looked into his face and appeared to summon every drop of sincerity she could muster: \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI am too. We just have to keep moving forward.\u201d To which he said, \u201cI\u2019m working on technology that\u2019s going to help us do that.\u201d He very briefly explained his project and then gently hugged her. \u201cThank you so much for telling me that,\u201d she replied.\n\nPeople stop her to say all sorts of other things as well, like the woman earlier that morning at her hotel gym who asked, \u201cAre you on Grey\u2019s Anatomy?\u201d No, Clinton said politely. \u201cHow do I know you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Chelsea Clinton,\u201d she said in her matter-of-fact way. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d said the woman. Clinton reassured her that no offense was taken, this sort of thing happens all the time. \u201cI just hope you thought I played a nurse or a doctor and not a corpse.\u201d\n\nSometimes the things strangers say to her are far less pleasant. \u201cI\u2019ve had people come up to me and say, \u2018I wish your mother had aborted you.\u2019 And I say, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry you feel that way,\u2019 \u201d Clinton told me. \u201cPeople have said to me, \u2018I hope you and your children die so your family line ends with you.\u2019 And I say, \u2018I hope you have a great day.\u2019 Because what else do you say to someone who has that much hate and bile? Except to respond with kindness, this sincere sense of, Not only do I not reflect that back to you, but I wish something different for you.\u201d\n\nThis is not what these years were supposed to be like for Chelsea Clinton. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be scarfing down gluten-free cereal bars and yogurt at the gate at La Guardia and then flying off to read her book to hundreds of young people at a zoo. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be comforting perfect strangers in airports over her mother\u2019s loss to Donald Trump. It\u2019s not hard to imagine she wouldn\u2019t have at least been considered as a choice by a President Hillary Clinton for, say, secretary of Education or Health and Human Services. At the very least, she would have been part of her mother\u2019s brain trust, the so-called kitchen cabinet. After all, for her entire life, people \u2014 including herself \u2014 seem to have expected this of Chelsea, that she would follow into the family business in some way or another. (And unlike Ivanka Trump, she has spent much of her career working on policy.) Another Clinton presidency, this one during her adulthood, would have been a kind of capstone to her professional life thus far.\n\nBut instead, after the cataclysmic event of her mother\u2019s loss \u2014 which she struggles to talk about \u2014 Clinton has cobbled together an unusual portfolio: a children\u2019s-book author who has sold over a million books, the vice-chair of the Clinton Foundation, and an adjunct professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, all while being a prominent member of the #resistance on Twitter and talk shows. She and her mother are currently on a multicity public tour for their joint book of essays, and she gave birth to her third child in August. Though each of these things is career enough for any normal human, one gets the feeling that she is a little insecure about whether she\u2019s doing all she can, all the good she can, whether it adds up to \u2026 enough, especially in the agonizing age of Trump.\n\nBorn in 1980, Clinton is, by my glib estimation, the First Millennial on the cusp of midlife. She has lived essentially half of her years in a kind of daughter-as-sidekick role in the shadow of two extraordinarily famous, accomplished people. It\u2019s clear that many of her choices so far have been dictated by what would serve the family project best. And now instead \u2014 in this period of time that, according to the family\u2019s plan, was going to be the full flowering of Clintonian ambition, her mother at long last smashing that glass ceiling \u2014 she\u2019s seeing a preview of the rest of her life. Her parents will always loom large, yes, but in this second half, she\u2019s got to figure out what she wants. She gets to figure out what she wants. It\u2019s probably unexpectedly freeing but also daunting and not a little scary.\n\n\u201cHer life has been characterized by all these huge events that have shaped her existence, over which she had no agency,\u201d said one of her best friends from her Oxford days, the British actor Simon Woods. \u201cThe way the last few years have played out have probably enabled her to be herself. There\u2019s less pressure on her now. She\u2019s not perpetually a surrogate for someone else. And that\u2019s a really good thing. So now is the time when she gets to shape her life by the choices she makes.\u201d\n\nClinton with her parents backstage at a campaign rally less than 24 hours before Election Day 2016. Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nClinton\u2019s publicity tour for Don\u2019t Let Them Disappear, a children\u2019s book about endangered species \u2014 her sixth book, and her fifth for children \u2014 began on April 2 and went well into May and took her all over the country. I joined her on the road for the swing through the Northeast and much of the South, mostly trundling among airports and hotels and book events, many of which took place at zoos. It was often just Clinton; her chief of staff, Bari Lurie; and me kibitzing during the spaces in between, figuring out where to get a bite and find a bathroom. Lurie and Chelsea first met when they were 20 and 21, when Lurie was an intern in Hillary\u2019s White House operation at the tail end of the Clinton administration in 2000.\n\nThe minute we arrived in Memphis, Clinton disappeared into a bathroom near the gate to do her makeup. She was five months pregnant, wearing jeans and a little black jacket, carrying a plain black Chanel bag heavy with books and electronic devices. While Lurie and I waited, we spotted Smokey Robinson sitting by himself. By the time Clinton came out ten minutes later, he was on his phone and Clinton decided not to bother him. \u201cI met him a couple of times, and he was lovely,\u201d she said, dragging her rolling suitcase through the airport. \u201cMy parents took me to listen to a lot of music when I was a little girl, especially my dad: Temptations, Four Tops, Smokey.\u201d\n\nIn the SUV on our way to the Memphis zoo, the conversation about music continued. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s concert film Homecoming had just been released on Netflix that week, and Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, had watched it. She and Lurie got to talking about that now-infamous moment when Beyonc\u00e9 FaceTimes Jay-Z to show-and-tell him how excited she is about fitting back into her costume after having given birth to twins but Jay-Z seems underwhelmed. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Marc, if that\u2019s ever me, you better have more enthusiasm,\u2019 \u201d Clinton says, letting out a big laugh. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you. That\u2019s amazing\u2019 that I arguably think any woman deserves, particularly someone who has clearly worked herself body, mind, heart, soul, and spirit to get to that place. Marc was like, \u2018Duly noted.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I bet every woman watching this has this sense of She deserves more enthusiasm. Marc was like, \u2018I got it. Can we go back to watching it, please? We\u2019ve talked about it three times in the last 90 seconds.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThe struggle is real,\u201d said Lurie, who had given birth four months prior and also has a 2-year-old. \u201cMen just don\u2019t get it. Your body made this thing \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo humans!\u201d Clinton shouted.\n\nBecause this is Chelsea Clinton, the conversation naturally turned to a lengthy disquisition on \u201cthe so-called developing world, where one in 45 women still die in childbirth. It\u2019s still incredibly dangerous for mothers and newborns. A million newborns die on their first day, and a million more die in their first month. And we know how to save most of the kids; we just don\u2019t have the structure and the systems to do it.\u201d Brief pause. \u201cAnyway, I loved Homecoming.\u201d\n\nThe Memphis event was packed and lively and had all the markers of a town hall, as if Clinton were running for office. A little boy named Caidyn asked, if she had to choose, would she rather be a paleontologist or an archaeologist. \u201cA question I\u2019ve never been asked before! And a good question! A paleontologist, because you find things that better help us understand climate change and extinction.\u201d Afterward, she did an interview with a local news station while a few people hovered around waiting for a selfie. I heard Clinton say to one of them, \u201cWe have a lot in common: I like zoos, and I like my mom too!\u201d Lurie and I were standing off to the side, and I mentioned that this felt a bit like a campaign stop. \u201cIt always happens,\u201d said Lurie. \u201cEven when the context is so not that, even when no Clinton is running anywhere for anything.\u201d\n\nThe people of America who love the Clintons behave around them in any organized setting as their constituents. A couple of weeks before, during a signing at Books of Wonder in New York, there was a fair showing of sensible liberals, women who wouldn\u2019t dream of coloring their hair, who move through the world with a chin-up longanimity. One was wearing a T-shirt with a blown-up picture of Hillary\u2019s face, the words YAS QUEEN! emblazoned underneath. At another signing in Atlanta, Chelsea got down on her knees and signed someone\u2019s sneakers. A southern-belle type appeared with her daughter \u2014 named Chelsea, born 1992.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that Chelsea Clinton is a southern girl. But when we landed in Memphis, her demeanor shifted ever so slightly \u2014 she seemed lighter, more expansive, giddier. Her accent thickened up a bit, too: \u201cAgenda\u201d became \u201caginda\u201d; \u201cI get it\u201d turned into \u201cI git it.\u201d It was almost incomprehensible to her that I had never been to Nashville or Memphis. You never been to Beale Street? You never been to Sun Studio? \u201cIt\u2019s this teeny tiny place. Where Elvis was discovered.\u201d Graceland? The Lorraine Motel where MLK was assassinated?\n\nIt pains her that we won\u2019t have time to go to the infamous spot, now the National Civil Rights Museum \u2014 so much so that the morning after our Memphis stop, she insisted that we order an Uber to the airport 15 minutes early so we could detour by the Lorraine Motel. \u201cI just think it\u2019s important that you see this,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish we had time to go in.\u201d To the driver: \u201cCan we go around to the other side? There you go, look. That particularly iconic view. At least you\u2019ve seen it \u2026 It is so well curated. After Dr. King was assassinated on April 4th \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cWas it April 4th or 6th?,\u201d said the driver, interrupting.\n\n\u201cApril 4th, 1968.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s an April 6 Street over there, so I don\u2019t know,\u201d said the driver, pointing in the direction of what\u2019s actually November 6 Street.\n\n\u201cHmmm. I think it\u2019s April 4th. I hope something good happened on April 6th.\u201d She let out a mordant chuckle. \u201cAnd there are other civil-rights museums. Montgomery, Vicksburg, which has even more Civil War \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cShiloh,\u201d said the driver\n\n\u201cSooo \u2026 Vicksburg actually has more monuments than Shiloh \u2014 \u201d\n\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is eerie. You\u2019ll go there and you\u2019ll understand the fight over Confederate monuments.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a pretty day!,\u201d said the driver.\n\n\u201cToday is the 24th,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cIgnominious day. Fifth anniversary of Flint not having clean water.\u201d Despite the fact that she has used the phrase \u201cwhen my mother was First Lady\u201d and talked about living in the White House, the driver never puts it all together. As we get out at the airport, he says, \u201cYou guys are real history buffs, aren\u2019t ya?!\u201d\n\nAs we were landing in Atlanta, the pilot came over the sound system and told the people on the left side of the plane that if we looked out the window, we could see Air Force One, which had just landed. Clinton did not look up from her Kindle. President Trump and the First Lady were here to speak at the gracelessly titled Rx Drug Abuse & Heroin Summit. Soon enough, our SUV hit traffic snarled by the presidential motorcade. Lurie was in the back making calls to the Georgia Aquarium, where we were headed for a private tour, letting them know we were running a little late. She was also trying to find a place for us to stop for lunch along the way.\n\n\u201cWe can eat after. I don\u2019t want to make us late,\u201d said Clinton.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually better to bump everything a little bit now,\u201d said Lurie.\n\n\u201cOkay, I just don\u2019t want to make anyone late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a little bit of a buffer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I just don\u2019t want to inconvenience anyone.\u201d\n\nClinton was now staring out the window, speaking under her breath, almost to herself. \u201cAll right. I do need to eat. But it can wait.\u201d We rode for a while as she and I talked about her friend who lives in Atlanta whom we were meeting at the aquarium. She heard Lurie say we\u2019d be there at 2:20 and started to obsess again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be 20 minutes late, so we\u2019ll eat superfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m clarifying for you. It was on your schedule as two, but it\u2019s not two. Relax. This is not a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loathe being late.\u201d\n\nWe pulled into the parking lot of a Baja Fresh near the aquarium at exactly 1 p.m. Plenty of time not to be late. We were all scarfing chips and salsa when a woman approached. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said. \u201cChelsea Clinton. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. What are you doing here? You\u2019re such a real person, sitting here in Baja Fresh. And you\u2019re, like, sooo beautiful.\u201d Her name was Cathy Heller, and she had a podcast. \u201cWe just had Howard Schultz on,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to talk about politics. We should have you on.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvite me!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we take a picture?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Clinton got up and put her arm around her. \u201cOh my gosh, Cathy, look at your amazing shoes.\u201d They have struck up an almost instantaneous camaraderie.\n\n\u201cSo how do you have time to do the books, change the world, be a mom?,\u201d said Heller. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m highly scheduled, and I have a great team. And I\u2019m very passionate about all of those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she loves nachos,\u201d said Lurie. \u201cWhich is why we\u2019re in Baja Fresh.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis says sooo much about you. You\u2019re just relaxed at the Baja Fresh.\u201d\n\nClinton says, \u201cThank you for being a woman in the business-podcasting space.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons promoting their book on Stephen Colbert\u2019s show this fall. Photo: Scott Kowalchyk/CBS via Getty Images\n\nSomething about being online seems to be freeing for Clinton: Her Twitter persona is spikier, angrier, a little more aggressive toward her political enemies and haters than she is in her daily life. In late September, when Trump called the impeachment probe and whistle-blower complaint \u201cthe greatest scam in the history of American politics!,\u201d Clinton retweeted it and wrote simply, \u201cYes, you are.\u201d She also comes out swinging for issues she cares about \u2014 \u201cShameful: House Republicans Are Pressuring Amazon to Sell Books on Gay Conversion Therapy, a form of child abuse.\u201d When Greta Thunberg tweeted about people \u201cgoing after me, my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences,\u201d something Clinton knows more about than she cares to, she tweeted to Thunberg, \u201cI am so sorry on behalf of all the adults who should know better and clearly don\u2019t.\u201d And was greeted on Twitter by a chorus of lefties who argued that Clinton\u2019s parents had been among those complicit in setting up the global system that has enabled climate change; being their daughter is a complicated legacy, even on #resistance Twitter.\n\nA friend of mine since first grade \u2014 the smartest, most politically astute person I know, who didn\u2019t go to college and never left our hometown \u2014 told me on the phone the other day that she treats Clinton\u2019s Twitter feed as a kind of guide to the \u201cshit\u201d she should care about. \u201cShe\u2019s like a fuckin\u2019 Twitter teacher!\u201d she said. When I shared this with Clinton one day over breakfast in Manhattan, she stared at me for a moment. I spooled it out a little further, into a question about people like my friend, who are scared and exhausted and look to her for a jolt of hope. Clinton listened intently and finally said, \u201cYou know, I think there is this sense, this perception now, that \u2026 you know, Is it just too hard? And yet, so many of the same people who are asking that are themselves persisting, to ensure that it\u2019s not as hard tomorrow.\u201d\n\nClinton is not on Instagram or Snapchat. She does not use Facebook to keep up with friends and family. But Twitter is different. \u201cIt can\u2019t be disconnected from the president\u2019s kind of mainstreaming and even mainlining of hate and hateful rhetoric. Twitter is the medium through which he largely does that,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet Twitter didn\u2019t create the president\u2019s bigotry. And it didn\u2019t create, I think, his horrific coddling of white nationalism. It just has enabled him to socialize it in an attempt to normalize it. Right? So I think it is important to respond online but to never think that that is a substitute for what still has to happen to make a real difference in real people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nI asked Chelsea what it\u2019s like doing interviews with her mother. She stared at me and blinked a couple of times. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nOffline, her tone as an author is less spicy. Clinton\u2019s picture book for kids, She Persisted, was the No. 1\u2013selling picture book at Penguin Young Readers in 2017. Clinton\u2019s editor there, Jill Santopolo (who also edits Kamala Harris and Sonia Sotomayor), was present at the launch of her book tour in April at the Bronx Zoo and brought along a tote bag filled with Clinton\u2019s books, including the sequel, She Persisted Around the World. Clinton has published seven books in five years, including It\u2019s Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired, & Get Going! and Start Now! You Can Make a Difference, books aimed to engage tween/teen activists. When Lurie handed me the tote bag, Clinton, who was being interviewed on-camera for a promotional spot for the zoo, said from across the room, \u201cYou could also give him my book Governing Global Health,\u201d drawn from her 712-page dissertation for her Ph.D. in international relations. \u201cI forgot that gem!,\u201d said Lurie, laughing. \u201cChelsea thinks the subtitle really gets ya: Who Runs the World and Why?\u201d Clinton said, smiling, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to read the whole book.\u201d\n\nHer children\u2019s-book career began when Santopolo saw Clinton on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart in 2013 discussing noncommunicable diseases. \u201cI was like, Why isn\u2019t she writing books for kids? She has this amazing ability to take a large, difficult concept and make it digestible,\u201d said Santopolo. She wrote a letter to Clinton, who, as a new mother, was particularly open to the idea because, she said, she had discovered \u201chow many kids\u2019 books are centered on male voices \u2014 even books about animals are told from the male-animal perspective. We desperately need to change that for our daughters and our sons.\u201d Then in early 2017, Republican senators tried to silence Elizabeth Warren during the Jeff Sessions confirmation hearings and \u2026 Nevertheless, she persisted. The phrase launched a gazillion memes and T-shirts but also a brand for Clinton. The book, about \u201c13 American Women Who Changed the World,\u201d sold like hotcakes and inspired a sequel; it has been adapted by the Bay Area Children\u2019s Theatre into an hour-long musical for kids that will likely appear in other cities beginning next year. She has also recently taken a bunch of pitch meetings in Hollywood toward turning She Persisted into a television special.\n\nIn some ways, working in the realm of children\u2019s content is an odd move. As a young girl, Clinton was not just taken seriously by adults (she grew up in the Arkansas governor\u2019s mansion and then the White House), she had no choice but to act like an adult when she was a child. Ironically, as an adult, she has been perpetually cast in the role of the dutiful daughter. So even now, there\u2019s a little girlishness that surfaces with some regularity \u2014 not stunted, just maybe a little repressed by circumstance. And she is earnest in the extreme, which is another aspect of her personality that adults can misread but that children connect with instantly. She has a deeply ingrained habit of remembering someone\u2019s name and repeating it when she addresses them. Surely, this is the result of being raised by two politicians. As How to Win Friends and Influence People reminds us, \u201cRemember that a person\u2019s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\u201d But it is also the coin of the realm in, say, kindergarten. At one point, I told her that because my friends have children who are reaching that crucial, questioning age, I was only just now realizing that when they ask me Why?, I\u2019ve got to answer it thoughtfully because they hang on every word I say. A big, mischievous smile spread across her face. \u201cWell, hopefully, Jonathan, you\u2019re yourself around your friends\u2019 children but you\u2019re yourself without the swear words.\u201d\n\nClinton in New York City with her children. Photo: Eldi/SplashNews.com\n\nTwo days later, Clinton was at the Lesniak Institute for American Leadership at Kean University in Union, New Jersey. The auditorium was packed with adults, some with kids in tow, and Clinton was here to do a Q&A with former state senator Raymond Lesniak about her book in particular and endangered species in general. Lesniak was wearing a baseball cap that read SENATOR RAY. He\u2019d helped put New Jersey at the forefront of animal welfare and conservation by, for example, banning the sale of ivory in the state as well as the importing of trophies of endangered species. This was the main reason Clinton agreed to join him onstage to promote her book. But Lesniak, who is 73 and recently retired after serving in office for 40 years, radiated the genial obliviousness of the career public servant who was reelected again and again. When she appeared onstage to surprisingly loud applause and took a seat next to him, he introduced her by holding up a blown-up photograph of \u2026 Chelsea with her parents when she was an awkward teenager. \u201cOh goodness,\u201d Clinton deadpanned as half the audience cooed on cue while the other half groaned in sympathy. \u201cWho\u2019s that girl?!,\u201d asked Lesniak, as if he were introducing a confusingly adult Shirley Temple. \u201cYou were so wonderful and powerful at the Democratic convention when your mom was nominated,\u201d he said, casting her as the sidekick yet again.\n\n\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d said Clinton, and then slowly, almost imperceptibly, she began to handle this guy, to take control. Clinton has a way of very politely, very subtly trolling people who cross a line. At one point, Lesniak said, \u201cMy wife says I always manage to turn the conversation back to me.\u201d Clinton leveled him with a look. \u201cWe are at the Lesniak Institute,\u201d she said. Later, he took a moment to brag. \u201cNew Jersey was the first state in the nation, with legislation sponsored by \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man sitting next to me,\u201d Clinton said to a laughing audience.\n\nWhen the questioning was turned over to the crowd, she said, \u201cAdults, please let the kids ask their questions first.\u201d \u201cI love how correct she is,\u201d I whispered to Lurie as Clinton answered a 7-year-old girl\u2019s question about whether she plans to run for office one day, a question Clinton has been answering since she was 3, which she always closes with some version of the following: \u201cSo while I don\u2019t have any plans to run for office, I think it\u2019s something that all of us who care about our communities and our country and world should be thinking about. Thank you for asking me that question, but even more, I hope you will ask yourself that question.\u201d\n\nIn early October, as if on cue, when the representative from New York Nita Lowey announced she would not seek reelection to Congress, press speculation ran rampant that Chelsea Clinton would run to replace her. Clinton put the rumors to rest on The View a week later, but, hilariously, reporters had convinced themselves that not hearing back from Clinton\u2019s office was \u201cfurther fueling\u201d speculation, when in fact her staffers field these calls so frequently they sometimes don\u2019t even bother to respond with denials.\n\nClinton\u2019s phlegmatic demeanor and her collected, deliberate, and measured way of speaking can sometimes read as detachment to those who don\u2019t know her. It can also seem like a coping mechanism, a way of deflecting \u2014 or absorbing \u2014 the endless lifelong scrutiny. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d says Lurie, \u201cI think people view it through the lens of political correctness, in comparison to celebrities, because they don\u2019t believe that anyone could truly, like, wake up and have a conversation with their kids about family separation at the border. But oh no: I walk into her apartment at 7:30 in the morning and she is teaching her daughter about how unfair and unjust it is. Don\u2019t get me wrong; there\u2019s also a debate about last night\u2019s episode of The Voice. It can be puzzling to others, but to those who know her best, it is one of the most endearing things about Chelsea. \u201d\n\nEvery moment, no matter how random, offers up an opportunity for her to teach. She can\u2019t be packaged into a sound bite; she is not a woman of slogans or one-liners. And in that regard, she is nothing like her parents \u2014 not a politician. She can\u2019t be rushed or interrupted. As someone who knows her well once said to me, \u201cYou ask her what time it is and she will build you a wristwatch.\u201d\n\nPeople \u2026 don\u2019t believe that anyone could truly, like, wake up and have a conversation with their kids about family separation at the border.\n\nOne day in New York, when Clinton was signing at Books of Wonder on 18th Street, I met her kids Charlotte and Aidan for the first time. The place was packed with parents and their children, including some of Clinton\u2019s school-mom friends. Charlotte had organized some sort of clever game and made herself the leader with a few other kids walking in line behind her, weaving under and around the ropes and stanchions. She was wearing red glasses that had slid down her nose, and when she looked up over the top of them, you could see her future: like she can\u2019t wait to be 45 years old and in charge of stuff. She\u2019s not just a chip off the old block \u2014 she\u2019s a chip off the old block who herself is a chip off the old block.\n\n\u201cWhat a kid!\u201d I said to Hillary Clinton on the phone one morning. \u201cShe really is a fun, curious little person, isn\u2019t she? We just have the best time with her,\u201d she replied. Nick Merrill, Hillary\u2019s longtime aide, told me that the grandchildren are \u201cthe center of Hillary\u2019s universe,\u201d that they \u201cprovide a normalcy that\u2019s hard to get if you\u2019re Hillary Clinton otherwise.\u201d Said Hillary, \u201cIf we\u2019ve got even an hour, we\u2019ll stop by and see them, read to them, play with them, maybe even help put them to bed and then go on to our evening activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you imagine what it\u2019s like to see Bill and Hillary babysitting a 3-year-old and a 5-year-old?,\u201d said Merrill.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019s conscious or deeply sublimated, but Chelsea does not talk all that much about her father. Indeed, she gives her mother most of the credit for instilling in her all the values she is rightly so proud of. She talks rhapsodically about Bill\u2019s mother, Virginia, with whom she spent a lot of weekends in Arkansas when she was a little girl. \u201cShe had a cardboard cutout of Elvis in her house,\u201d Chelsea told me late one night as we were driving from Athens to Atlanta. \u201cEvery Saturday, she would have a Scotch-and-soda, only one, at five o\u2019clock, and then she would make dinner and we always had homemade macaroni and cheese, stewed tomatoes, and either chicken or fish. And on special occasions she would bake a chocolate cake, and then we would watch \u2014 truly, every Saturday night that I stayed with her \u2014 a different Elvis movie. And there are 50 of them. That\u2019s just what we diiid. And then we would go to church the next morning.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon in early June, I visited Chelsea at the Clinton Foundation HQ in midtown on a day when she was recording the podcast she does with her father, though he wasn\u2019t around. The former president and the former secretary of State were at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative Action Network on \u201cPost-Disaster Recovery in the U.S. Virgin Islands,\u201d and the offices were quiet because the entire CGI team was also away at the meeting.\n\nChelsea was doing an interview with Kurt Kelly, the owner of the Stonewall Inn, as Gay Pride was a few weeks away (She attended the 50th-anniversary celebration at Stonewall on the Friday of Pride Weekend and was photographed hanging out with Lady Gaga and Donatella Versace). Chelsea may be the least-vain celebrity I\u2019ve ever met, but she is always put together. On this day, not so much: She was wearing a long blue cotton sack dress and a pair of beat-up old sneakers with no socks. Long straight hair, zero makeup, and glasses: magenta frames, as nerdy as they come. I almost didn\u2019t recognize her.\n\nKelly arrived, and we all piled into a small room filled with recording equipment and her podcast producers. Kelly was nervous at first, intimidated to the point of freezing up. \u201cMy mind is a little overwhelmed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many stories.\u201d Clinton said, in the sweetest way imaginable, \u201cAnd I want to hear them allll, so you can talk for as long as you want.\u201d\n\nWhen the interview was over, I wandered around the offices with Lurie. There was unusual, exotic art on nearly every wall, all of it gathered during President Clinton\u2019s travels to every corner of the globe. Later, I talked to Maura Pally, who, like Lurie, interned in Hillary\u2019s office when she was First Lady. She has been working at the Clinton Foundation for six years, now as the executive vice-president. Pally has particular insight into how Chelsea works with her father at the foundation. \u201cThey speak each other\u2019s language so clearly, so they have a shorthand with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also she is the one person who doesn\u2019t hesitate to challenge him and correct him on things. You know, if he is talking about something, which of course is always very factually driven and statistics driven, Chelsea will be like, \u2018Actually, Dad, you\u2019re wrong. Here is the correct factoid.\u2019 And he\u2019ll be like, \u2018Yup \u2026 you were right. That\u2019s my daughter. Has more degrees than me and Hillary combined and is smarter than the two of us combined.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t really have that banter with anybody else.\u201d\n\nThe foundation has always had a complicated relationship to Clintonian political power, but since Hillary lost the election, the organization has been struggling to find its footing. The Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting ended in the run-up to 2016, after 12 years. \u201cWe had accomplished what we had set out to do,\u201d Pally said, referring to its goal of making power-broker conferences more about action and less about schmoozing, \u201cand frankly, we knew that would be very challenging, in a hyperpolitical environment, to have heads of states and CEOs come to a Clinton stage to focus on issues.\u201d The foundation now does targeted disaster relief and runs a program for college students, among other initiatives, with which Chelsea is deeply involved. It has also focused its philanthropic efforts on issues like climate-smart agricultural practices in Africa, the opioid epidemic, and Too Small to Fail, an early-childhood program that Chelsea and her mother launched together when the secretary joined.\n\nFrom talking with Clinton Foundation folks, I got the sense that Chelsea has helped change things at the organization through sheer force of personality. And among the cache of Clinton-related emails published via WikiLeaks was a series in which it was clear that Chelsea had been the driving force behind severing the foundation\u2019s ties with Teneo, the consulting organization run by Bill Clinton\u2019s friend (and infamous \u201cbuckraker\u201d) Doug Band.\n\nWhen I asked Pally if Hillary\u2019s run and subsequent loss had changed the organization in ways that have been disappointing, she said, \u201cDo you have 12 hours?,\u201d and let out an exasperated laugh. \u201cI think honestly what really impacted us was the complete and utter political attacks and lies that came at us just relentlessly. We became a political punching bag, and I think in hindsight people look back and say, \u2018Oh yeah, of course that wasn\u2019t true.\u2019 \u201d Still, for Chelsea, the net effect has been one of reassessment. She must reconstitute this part of her professional life, too.\n\nGetting Chelsea Clinton to divulge her feelings about her mother\u2019s losing the election turned out to be a fool\u2019s errand. (As one person in the Clinton orbit said to me about Hillary, and it is also true about Chelsea, \u201cFeelings are not the immediate destination in any conversation.\u201d) I thought I could ladder her up to feelings by confessing my own trauma and subsequent anxiety during and after that Tuesday night in November. Nice try. \u201cFor me, what\u2019s traumatic is what\u2019s happened since. As sad as I was on Election Night for my mom, I\u2019m far sadder for our country,\u201d she said. What followed was a long list: demonizing Mexicans, white-nationalist rhetoric, family separation, anti-choice justices.\n\nA person who worked on Hillary\u2019s campaign told me it\u2019s not just Chelsea who has a hard time talking about Election Night: \u201cWe all failed to process that day in a lot of ways. The other thing is \u2014 and this is purely a guess \u2014 if I were Chelsea Clinton, I would have felt both enormous sadness for her mom and the country but also a sense of relief that probably has some guilt attached to it.\u201d One person close to the Clintons said to me, \u201cThe whole family will never fully recover from this.\u201d\n\nA week after I first asked Chelsea about Election Night, I brought it up again and got nowhere in the feelings department, but I did get this oddly detached response: \u201cI was still breastfeeding. Aidan was not even 5 months old. We went and we voted, and then I spent time with our kids and spent a lot of time breastfeeding and pumping, because that\u2019s what women do when we\u2019re committed to having that relationship with our babies. And then I took my kids to the hotel and we\u2019re with my parents and we got the kids ready for bed and then I think my friend Jen actually, literally brought the kids home and helped get them to bed. We were with my mom, and I pumped a lot on and off for the rest of the night.\u201d\n\nAside from putting their heads down and getting right back to work, as is their way, one of the things mother and daughter did was write together \u2014 something they would not have had time to do if Hillary had been president. First, Chelsea\u2019s publisher persuaded them to do a children\u2019s book together, Grandma\u2019s Gardens, which comes out next year, which got everyone thinking about doing something weightier. The Book of Gutsy Women, which came out on October 1, is essentially a collection of essays \u2014 some written by Chelsea, some by Hillary, and some jointly \u2014 about women who have inspired them both: Geraldine Ferraro, Harriet Tubman, Helen Keller. \u201cWe wrote, actually, more than 200 essays, which we cut in half,\u201d said Hillary. \u201cIt was really painful.\u201d She gets excited talking about their editorial choices. \u201cI write about the first famous woman I ever saw in person \u2026 who was Maria Tallchief, the Native American prima ballerina,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Chelsea talks about how she got to meet her later. We both learned a lot. I mean, obviously it\u2019s easier to write alone, but its very stimulating to write with someone else. It was, as we say, an iterative process.\u201d\n\nLurie told me the collaboration was fascinating to watch. \u201cThey write so differently. Hillary still writes and edits in longhand, while Chelsea believes that Microsoft Word is your friend.\u201d So they wound up bouncing drafts back and forth to each other via email.\n\nThis fall, the two embarked on a joint book tour. It has not been without controversy: Last week, reports circulated that Hillary had been contemplating jumping into the 2020 race, and on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show, her former aide Philippe Reines stoked the flames by saying that while it was unlikely, she had not closed the door on the possibility. That was on top of the hot water she had gotten into for reportedly saying the candidate Tulsi Gabbard was being groomed by the Russians. She\u2019d actually said \u201cRepublicans,\u201d not Russians (although she said Gabbard is \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d), but by the time that was cleared up, a Clinton outrage cycle on Twitter had been through all of its predictable and exhausting life phases.\n\nBut before all that, there was the launch, when Hillary and Chelsea finished a long, lively talk with Billie Jean King on the stage of the Kings Theatre on Flatbush Avenue. It was late for a Tuesday night, the first day of October, the end of Rosh Hashanah. When I\u2019d arrived a couple of hours earlier, the street out front was thrumming with the kind of energy one associates with Times Square in the \u201980s. There was the joyful boom-box throb of Flatbush, sure, but also a sizable group of angry Haitian protesters who were still convinced that the Clinton Foundation had mishandled funds meant for the recovery from the 2010 earthquake. Because of the protesters, there was also a sizable police presence, some with dogs, lending a sort of free-floating unease to the scene. But the crowd inside the theater leaned toward the genteel stroller people of the increasingly white, liberal neighborhoods that surround Prospect Park. As the program came to an end, hundreds of them, already standing for a lusty ovation, surged toward the stage instead of the exits.\n\nI noticed Chelsea\u2019s husband in the very center of the throng, smiling and taking pictures of his wife and mother-in-law. When Hillary \u2014 who had seemed cranky before the event but was now buoyant, reaching out to grab hands and soak in the adoration \u2014 pulled back from the edge of the stage in her burgundy pantsuit and waved good-bye, the crowd erupted into cheers and whistles, some shouting, \u201cI love you!\u201d As the last remaining stalwarts of Hillaryland (Huma!) headed backstage, everyone looked a little stunned, even emotional.\n\nChelsea\u2019s staff was making arrangements to whisk her back to Manhattan to her son Jasper, now 14 weeks old. Meanwhile, in a hallway amid the backstage hubbub, Hillary was telling King the story about \u201cthe only time I ever won a trophy\u201d as a not very good tennis player. It was a mixed-doubles match at a tournament at a Fayetteville, Arkansas, country club. When she and her partner were presented with one trophy (\u201cNo, no, no!,\u201d says BJK), Hillary was struck by the fact that the little golden plastic male tennis player on top of the trophy was several inches larger than the female player. \u201cOf course, I have that trophy!,\u201d said Hillary, laughing that deep, gusty laugh of hers. \u201cI said to my partner, the guy, \u2018You have to let me have this trophy, because this is such a statement.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEventually, I found Chelsea in a dressing room and we sat and talked for a few minutes. She was running late. \u201cI have to go take this picture with my mom, and then I have to go home and pump.\u201d I asked Chelsea \u2014 the pro, an expert in answering nosy questions with a long, thoughtful answer that sometimes doesn\u2019t actually answer the question \u2014 what it\u2019s like doing interviews with her mother. This was the first time I had ever seen her screen freeze up. She stared at me with her big blue eyes and blinked a couple of times. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d There were a few more awkward seconds. \u201cI love working with my mom.\u201d Blink, blink. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nMaybe she was just rushed and tired, but it\u2019s hard not to think that maybe it isn\u2019t so, you know, fun. Chelsea and Hillary had begun their media blitz for Gutsy Women just a few days before, right after Nancy Pelosi announced that the House was, at long last, launching an impeachment inquiry. Which meant that every interview (CBS This Morning, Good Morning America, The View, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert) was front-loaded with Important Questions for Hillary \u2014 arguably the world\u2019s foremost living expert on the subject, having been on the Nixon impeachment-inquiry staff in 1974 and married to the only president to have been impeached in the past 150 years. Their joint interviews about the book they co-authored were hijacked by the news, and here was Chelsea, cast once again as the dutiful daughter, listening respectfully.\n\nThe Ford Foundation on East 43rd Street is a deeply familiar yet utterly obscure structure that is easy to walk right past, because from almost every angle it looks like an impenetrable fortress. It is just a block from the United Nations, and I can\u2019t help but think about the time, ten years ago, when I spent a couple of days following then\u2013Secretary of State Hillary Clinton through her appointments during the U.N. General Assembly \u2014 the first and last time I had a reason to go to the U.N. It felt both rarefied and prosaic, teeming with people who spend their days trying to redraw the blueprint for how life could \u2014 should \u2014 be lived, if only everyone else would wake up and cooperate. Unlike the rest of us, these folks, Hillary especially, seemed to have an extra strand in their DNA, another gear the rest of us lack, that allows them to tolerate the drudgery and sacrifice, not to mention the endless disappointment and thanklessness, of trying to make the world a better place.\n\nI was always mystified by the fact that so many of my friends had so many misgivings about Hillary. But on that long spring book tour, I came up with a theory: Chelsea, like her mother, makes people feel guilty, almost ashamed, that they\u2019re not doing enough. That unless you are pitching in and helping and doing good \u2014 almost constantly \u2014 you are not measuring up. It\u2019s not that these people necessarily dislike Hillary, I realized; at least for some of them, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t like the way Hillary makes them feel about themselves. I caught a whiff of this in Brooklyn at the Kings Theatre, when, toward the end, Hillary said, \u201cWe hope that these stories don\u2019t just end with admiring those we profile but lead people to think about what each of you can do in some area that\u2019s important to you. And only you can know what that might be.\u201d In other words: Don\u2019t just enjoy this! It must lead you to discover a sense of purpose! Now imagine if you were that person\u2019s only child.\n\nI was meeting Chelsea Clinton this morning at the Ford Foundation for a gathering of Girl Scouts young and old. As it happens \u2014 and this will probably come as no surprise \u2014 Chelsea was a Girl Scout. So was her mother. So was Condoleezza Rice. Indeed, 72 percent of all female senators were Girl Scouts, and about 60 percent of the women in the House were once part of a troop.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation had partnered with the Girl Scouts to host an event on the importance of civics education: Chelsea was running a panel that included New York Attorney General Letitia James; Laura Dove, the Republican secretary of the U.S. Senate; Dr. Emma Humphries, chief education officer for iCivics; and Lauren Hoagland, a Gold Award Girl Scout from Birmingham, Alabama, who had just turned 18.\n\nAs the discussion was winding down, Chelsea turned to questions written on note cards from the Girl Scouts in the audience. \u201cThere\u2019s a question I feel obligated to ask because it\u2019s come up quite frequently, and I think this is a very succinct expression of it: \u2018How can we ask our girls to be brave and engaged when they see women candidates or other women who are in powerful positions treated badly or unfairly?\u2019 \u201d The resonance of Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter reading this question is lost on no one. James gave a great little speech about why these young girls must run for office. Humphries told a sharp, funny mean-girls story about a friend saying horrible things about her when she was their age and the invaluable three-word piece of advice she got from a teacher: \u201cConsider the source.\u201d Then Hoagland, the 18-year-old, who had been getting the biggest applause lines all morning, said, \u201cPowerful women have always turned heads. They\u2019ve always made people a little bit confused. All of you will turn some heads. You\u2019re going to get people confused as to why you care \u2026 It\u2019s a choice to be brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen!,\u201d said Chelsea.\n\nAfterward, Lurie and I worked our way through the packed reception room \u2014 filled with women and girls laughing and talking, a sound so distinct it ought to be a ringtone \u2014 and headed back into the greenroom and found Chelsea, then still hugely pregnant, sitting on a sofa, eating a muffin. The room was decorated with beautifully framed photographs of those who had appeared at the Ford Foundation for one reason or another. Above Chelsea\u2019s head was a giant photograph of her father. Her other staffers, Joy and Sara, turned up, and there was a lot of animated chitchat about how moving the program was, how well-organized the event was. \u201cThe Girl Scouts are on it,\u201d said Lurie. \u201cRight?,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a metaphor!\u201d And then, as she absentmindedly gathered her things to head off, she said to no one in particular, \u201cWas anyone sitting near Lauren\u2019s mom? She must be beaming. She must be so proud of her.\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the October 28, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
