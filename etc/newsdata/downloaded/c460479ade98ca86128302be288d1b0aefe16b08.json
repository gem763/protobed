It isn\u2019t just their differing politics that\u2019s a source of tension; Alan\u2019s new supermarket job brings an unexpected challenge in the form of a wild local lad, and at Far Slack Farm Gillian (Nicola Walker) faces trouble with a giraffe,\" the BBC said.\n\n\"Meanwhile John (Tony Gardner) is back on the scene, and Caroline (Sarah Lancashire) finds herself entangled in an emotional debacle with someone at work. Into all of this jets Alan\u2019s brother Ted (Timothy West) on holiday from New Zealand.
