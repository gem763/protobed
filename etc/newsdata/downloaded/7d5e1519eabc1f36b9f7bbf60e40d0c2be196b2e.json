They note that in the cases of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, the House held initial votes on whether to proceed.\n\nDemocrats say a vote isn't necessary for an inquiry ahead of more formal impeachment proceedings.\n\nWhile Giuliani was given a wide-ranging subpoena by Democrats, Pence's office was asked to provide Congress with certain documents.\n\nIn a statement released late Tuesday, Pence's office said it would only cooperate if Congress returned to the \"regular order of legitimate legislative oversight requests.\"\n\n(MORE: Rudy Giuliani's relationship with arrested men is subject of criminal investigation: Sources)\n\n\"Until that time, the Office of the Vice President will continue to reserve all rights and privileges that may apply, including those protecting executive privileges, national security, attorney-client communications, deliberations, and communications among the President, the Vice President, and their advisors,\" Pence's office stated.\n\nThe House is investigating a whistleblower complaint that Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and Biden's son. Giuliani has emerged as a central figure in the inquiry, pressing repeatedly a discredited theory that corrupt Ukrainian politicians meddled in the 2016 elections and were trying to help Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials say it was Russia, not Ukraine, that orchestrated election interference and in favor of Trump, not Clinton.\n\nPence and Giuliani also have defended the push for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
