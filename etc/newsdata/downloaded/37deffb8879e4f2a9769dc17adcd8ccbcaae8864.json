Nearly all the polls show that now people want to remain in the EU. We feel that we are voiceless,\" said Hannah Barton, 56, a cider maker from central England, who was draped in an EU flag.\n\n\"This is a national disaster waiting to happen and it is going to destroy the economy.\"\n\nAfter more than three years of tortuous debate, it is still uncertain how, when or even if Brexit will happen as Prime Minister Boris Johnson tries to pass his new Brexit deal and plots a way out of the deepest political crisis in a generation.\n\nWhile Brexit has divided families, parties, parliament and the country, both sides agree Saturday and the coming days could be some of the most important in recent British history: a juncture that could shape the fate of the United Kingdom for generations.\n\nLawmakers voted to withhold support for the Brexit deal until formal ratification legislation has passed, a step that will oblige Johnson to seek a delay.\n\nAs the crowd watched events in parliament unfold on large screens and mobile phones they cheered and shouted \"people's vote\" as they viewed the result as another chance to stop Brexit.\n\nMany protesters carried placards, some comparing Brexit to the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. Some wore elaborate costumes with one dressed as a banana holding a sign saying \"we are 'ripe' for change\".\n\nThere were also effigies mocking politicians such as Johnson and his key adviser Dominic Cummings.\n\nMany of the signs displayed a dry British sense of humor. One said: \"I am very cross about this\" while another was: \"I made this sign instead of screaming\".\n\nAs the marchers advanced some blew whistles and erupted in shouts of \"Stop Brexit\". A percussion band played and a gathering sang the EU's anthem \"Ode to Joy\".\n\nJames McGrory, director of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which organized the march, said ahead of the protest the government should heed the anger of pro-Europeans and hold another referendum on EU membership.\n\n\"This new deal bears no resemblance to what people were promised and so it is only right that the public deserve another chance to have their say,\" he said.\n\nCampaigners are confident that the protest will rival a similar demonstration in March when organizers said 1 million people took to the streets. A rally this size would be among the largest ever in Britain.\n\nLondon's police said it does not provide an estimates for the size of rallies because it is an \"inexact science\", but tweeted pictures showing streets and the square outside parliament crammed with protesters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBREXIT REVERSED?\n\nThe mood of protesters ranged from anger to despair. Many railed against political leaders championing Brexit for being elite and out of touch.\n\nSome were young people who were unable to vote during the 2016 referendum and described the fight for another vote as the defining political event of their lives.\n\n\"If we leave the EU this is not the end of this, we will keep fighting to rejoin until that happens,\" said Victoria Paynter, 17, who held a sign \"check us before you wreck us\".\n\nIn 2016, 52% backed Brexit, while 48% backed remaining in the EU.\n\nSome opinion polls have shown a slight shift in favor of remaining in the EU, but there has yet to be a decisive change in attitudes and many voters say they have become increasingly bored by Brexit.\n\nSince July 2017 there have been 226 polls asking people whether they support Leave or Remain, according to a poll of polls by YouGov published last week. Of those, 204 have put support for remaining in the EU ahead, seven have given a lead to leave and a few have been tied.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Britons marched through London on Saturday to demand a new Brexit referendum and celebrated as lawmakers in parliament voted to postpone Britain's departure from the European Union.
