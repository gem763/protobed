So, I hope you packed your umbrella.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Bureau of Meteorology told press that \u201cit will be a bit wet, and a little windy,\u201d which seems like a light way to describe up to 100mm of rain.\n\nAccording to Sky News Weather, Newcastle and surrounding areas are set to cop the worst of it, with about 100mm predicted. The rest of the NSW coast won\u2019t cop it quite as bad, with about 50mm set to hit the rest of the coast.\n\nSydney\u2019s warm morning of up to 30 degrees in some areas is screeching to a halt this afternoon, dropping by seven degrees in less than an hour. The torrential rain is predicted to begin this afternoon and continue throughout the night starting in the south west.\n\nBut the worst of the storm isn\u2019t expected to hit until tomorrow, with Sydney\u2019s \u201crain bomb\u201d expected to hit at some point on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cSydney could be seeing up to 45mm of rain and Newcastle could be seeing up to 60mm rain from this event,\u201d Sky News Weather presenter Rachel Raez said.\n\nA strong wind warning is currently in place for the southeast coast of NSW, which has been escalated to a gale force wind warning for the Macquarie, Hunter and Sydney Coasts on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorology, the rain and wind is set to stick around until at least Thursday, but we should see a bit of relief on Friday before a rainy weekend.\n\nOur meteorologist Miriam Bradbury presents next week's weather forecast as aired today on ABC Landline.
