For a very long time, Britain and the United States styled themselves as the custodians and promoters of democracy globally, fighting a great moral battle against its foreign enemies. From the cold war through to the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, the Caesarism that afflicted other nations was seen as peculiar to Asian and African peoples, or blamed on the despotic traditions of Russians or Chinese, on African tribalism, Islam, or the \u201cArab mind\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian view on Modi\u2019s 100 days: trashing lives and the constitution | Editorial Read more\n\nBut this analysis \u2013 amplified in a thousand books and opinion columns that located the enemies of democracy among menacingly alien people and their inferior cultures \u2013 did not prepare its audience for the sight of blond bullies perched atop the world\u2019s greatest democracies. The barbarians, it turns out, were never at the gate; they have been ruling us for some time.\n\nThe belated shock of this realisation has made impotent despair the dominant tone of establishment commentary on the events of the past few years. But this acute helplessness betrays something more significant. While democracy was being hollowed out in the west, mainstream politicians and columnists concealed its growing void by thumping their chests against its supposed foreign enemies \u2013 or cheerleading its supposed foreign friends.\n\nDecades of this deceptive and deeply ideological discourse about democracy have left many of us struggling to understand how it was hollowed from within \u2013 at home and abroad. Consider the stunning fact that India, billed as the world\u2019s largest democracy, has descended into a form of Hindu supremacism \u2013 and, in Kashmir, into racist imperialism of the kind it liberated itself from in 1947.\n\nNarendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government is enforcing a seemingly endless curfew in the valley of Kashmir, imprisoning thousands of people without charge, cutting phone lines and the internet, and allegedly torturing suspected dissenters. Modi has established \u2013 to massive Indian acclaim \u2013 the regime of brute power and mendacity that Mahatma Gandhi explicitly warned his compatriots against: \u201cEnglish rule without the Englishman\u201d.\n\nAll this while \u201cthe mother of parliaments\u201d reels under English rule with a particularly reckless Englishman, and Israel \u2013 the \u201conly democracy in the Middle East\u201d \u2013 holds another election in which millions of Palestinians under its ethnocratic rule are denied a vote.\n\nThe vulnerabilities of western democracy were evident long ago to the Asian and African subjects of the British empire. Gandhi, who saw democracy as literally the rule of the people, the demos, claimed that it was merely \u201cnominal\u201d in the west. It could have no reality so long as \u201cthe wide gulf between the rich and the hungry millions persists\u201d and voters \u201ctake their cue from their newspapers which are often dishonest\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Looking ahead to our own era, Gandhi predicted that even \u201cthe states that are today nominally democratic\u201d are likely to \u201cbecome frankly totalitarian\u201d.

But the delay in heeding Ambedkar\u2019s warning has been lethal \u2013 and it has left many of our best and brightest stultified by the antics of Trump and Johnson, simultaneously aghast at the sharpened critiques of a resurgent left, and profoundly unable to reckon with the annihilation of democracy by its supposed friends abroad.\n\nModi has been among the biggest beneficiaries of this intellectual impairment. For decades, India itself greatly benefited from a cold war-era conception of \u201cdemocracy\u201d, which reduced it to a morally glamorous label for the way rulers are elected, rather than about the kinds of power they hold, or the ways they exercise it.\n\nAs a non-communist country that held routine elections, India possessed a matchless international prestige despite consistently failing \u2013 worse than many Asian, African, and Latin American countries \u2013 in providing its citizens with even the basic components of a dignified existence.\n\nIt did not matter to the fetishists of formal and procedural democracy that people in Kashmir and India\u2019s north-eastern border states lived under de facto martial law, where security forces had unlimited licence to massacre and rape, or that a great majority of the Indian population found the promise of equality and dignity underpinned by rule of law and impartial institutions, to be a remote, almost fantastical, ideal.\n\nThe halo of virtue around India shone brighter as its governments embraced free markets and communist-run China abruptly emerged as a challenger to the west. Modi profited from an exuberant consensus about India among Anglo-American elites: that democracy had acquired deep roots in Indian soil, fertilising it for the growth of free markets.\n\nAs chief minister of the state of Gujarat in 2002, Modi was suspected of a crucial role \u2013 ranging from malign inaction to watchful complicity \u2013 in an anti-Muslim pogrom of gruesome violence. The US and the European Union denied Modi a visa for several years.\n\nBut his record was suddenly forgotten as Modi ascended, with the help of India\u2019s richest businessmen, to power. \u201cThere is something thrilling about the rise of Narendra Modi,\u201d Gideon Rachman, the chief foreign affairs columnist for the Financial Times, wrote in April 2014. Rupert Murdoch, of course, anointed Modi as India\u2019s \u201cbest leader with best policies since independence\u201d.\n\nBut Barack Obama also chose to hail Modi for reflecting \u201cthe dynamism and potential of India\u2019s rise\u201d. As Modi arrived in Silicon Valley in 2015 \u2013 just as his government was shutting down the internet in Kashmir \u2013 Sheryl Sandberg declared she was changing her Facebook profile in order to honour the Indian leader.\n\nIn the next few days, Modi will address thousands of affluent Indian-Americans in the company of Trump in Houston, Texas. While his government builds detention camps for hundreds of thousands Muslims it has abruptly rendered stateless, he will receive a commendation from Bill Gates for building toilets.\n\nThe fawning by Western politicians, businessmen, and journalists over a man credibly accused of complicity in a mass murder is a much bigger scandal than Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s donations to MIT. But it has gone almost wholly unremarked in mainstream circles partly because democratic and free-marketeering India was the great non-white hope of the ideological children of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher who still dominate our discourse: India was a gilded oriental mirror in which they could cherish themselves.\n\nThis moral vanity explains how even sentinels of the supposedly reasonable centre, such as Obama and the Financial Times, came to condone demagoguery abroad \u2013 and, more importantly, how they failed to anticipate its eruption at home.\n\nEven the most fleeting glance at history shows that the contradiction Ambedkar identified in India \u2013 which enabled Modi\u2019s rise \u2013 has long bedevilled the emancipatory promise of democratic equality. In 1909, Max Weber asked: \u201cHow are freedom and democracy in the long run at all possible under the domination of highly developed capitalism?\u201d\n\nThe decades of atrocity that followed answered Weber\u2019s question with a grisly spectacle. The fraught and extremely limited western experiment with democracy did better only after social-welfarism, widely adopted after 1945, emerged to defang capitalism, and meet halfway the formidable old challenge of inequality. But the rule of demos still seemed remote.\n\nThe Cambridge political theorist John Dunn was complaining as early as 1979 that while democratic theory had become the \u201cpublic cant of the modern world\u201d, democratic reality had grown \u201cpretty thin on the ground\u201d. Since then, that reality has grown flimsier, corroded by a financialised mode of capitalism that has held Anglo-American politicians and journalists in its thrall since the 1980s.\n\nWhat went unnoticed until recently was that the chasm between a political system that promises formal equality and a socio-economic system that generates intolerable inequality had grown much wider. It eventually empowered the demagogues who now rule us. In other words, modern democracies have for decades been lurching towards moral and ideological bankruptcy \u2013 unprepared by their own publicists to cope with the political and environmental disasters that unregulated capitalism ceaselessly inflicts, even on such winners of history as Britain and the US.\n\nHaving laboured to exclude a smelly past of ethnocide, slavery and racism \u2013 and the ongoing stink of corporate venality \u2013 from their perfumed notion of Anglo-American superiority, the promoters of democracy have no nose for its true enemies. Ripe for superannuation but still entrenched on the heights of politics and journalism, they repetitively ventilate their rage and frustration, or whinge incessantly about \u201ccancel culture\u201d and the \u201cradical left\u201d, it is because that is all they can do. Their own mind-numbing simplicities about democracy, its enemies, friends, the free world, and all that sort of thing, have doomed them to experience the contemporary world as an endless series of shocks and debacles.\n\n\u2022 Pankaj Mishra is an Indian author and writer of literary and political essays.
