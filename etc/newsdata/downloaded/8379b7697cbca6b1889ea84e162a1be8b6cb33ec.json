Since yesterday was a Monday, there is also a gap up on the weekly chart.\n\nThe bulls want a measured move up. Their minimum goal is based on the height of the 5-day bull channel from the October 18 low to the October 24 high. Since it was about 40 points, their 1st target is around 3055.\n\nThe bears want the gap to close this week. If there is a gap down, there would then be an island top.\n\nWhen there is a gap above important resistance, the Emini often goes sideways for a day or two. It then decides if the breakout will succeed or fail.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s is a potential catalyst for a big up move up or down. Since traders may wait for the news before trading aggressively, there is an increased chance of sideways trading today.\n\nOvernight Emini Globex trading\n\nThe Emini is down 2 points in the Globex session. It, therefore, might have a small gap down on the open. That would create a 1-day island top. Island tops and bottoms are typically minor reversal patterns. Also, a small gap usually closes in the 1st hour. It would not significantly increase the chance of a failed breakout above the July all-time high.\n\nYesterday was a small trading range day. Tomorrow\u2019s FOMC rate cut announcement is a potential catalyst. Consequently, traders expect that today will probably be another mostly sideways day.\n\nSometimes traders front-run a major announcement. That means there is a slightly increased chance of a big trend up or down today. Unless there is a series of big trend bars, day traders will assume that today will again have a lot of trading range price action.\n\nYesterday\u2019s setups\n\nEmini 5 Minute Chart: Trading Range\n\nHere are several reasonable stop entry setups from yesterday. I show each buy entry with a green rectangle and each sell entry with a red rectangle. I rarely also show limit order entries and entries on the close of bars. Buyers of the Brooks Trading Course and Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns have access to a much more detailed explanation of the swing trades for each day.\n\nMy goal with these charts is to present an Always In perspective. If a trader was trying to be Always In or nearly Always In a position all day, and he was not currently in the market, these entries would be logical times for him to enter.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Al Brooks covering: S&P 500 Futures.
