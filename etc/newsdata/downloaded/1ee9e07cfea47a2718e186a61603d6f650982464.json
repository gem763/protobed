State officials ordered the special election earlier this year, and invalidated a win by GOP candidate Dan McCready in the 2018 midterms, after uncovering apparent ballot fraud efforts.\n\nBefore leaving Washington, Trump dismissed questions of whether a poor result for the Republican candidate would serve as a warning sign for 2020.\n\n\"No, I don't see it as a bellwether,\" Trump said.\n\nSome analysts have said the fraud scandal could undercut the new Republican candidate for the seat, Dan Bishop, and undermine any attempts to draw larger lessons from the race.\n\nHowever, the special election could offer clues about the mindset of Republicans in the suburbs, whose flight from the party fueled the GOP's 2018 House election losses.\n\nThe House district flows eastward from the prosperous Charlotte suburbs into rural areas hugging the South Carolina border. State officials invalidated last November's election following allegations of voter fraud by a GOP operative.\n\nThe district has been held by the GOP since 1963. In 2016, Trump won the district by 11 percentage points. Should Bishop defeat Democrat Dan McCready, it could give Trump room to assert that he pulled Bishop over the top. If McCready prevails or Bishop wins by a whisker, it will suggest GOP erosion and raise questions about Trump's and his party's viability for 2020.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA POLITICAL OPERATIVE FACES MORE CHARGES IN BALLOT FRAUD CASE\n\n\"This will tell us if Trump can carry candidates through suburban districts or not,\" said Sarah Chamberlain, president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, which represents moderate Republicans. If not, she said, the GOP must \"work harder to address the concerns of suburban individuals, mainly women.\"\n\nThe rally may also pose a different sort of test: It will be held just over 100 miles from the site of a Trump rally in July where \"send her back\" chants aimed at a Somali-born American congresswoman rattled the Republican Party. Trump later condemned the chant, which has not been repeated at subsequent Trump events.\n\nMarshville residents Philip and Diane Ezzell, both 70, were near the front of the line Monday waiting to enter the Trump rally. Both attributed their support for Bishop to his backing by Trump.\n\n\"We like his values, and he supports Trump,\" Diane Ezzell said. \"And we don't want no socialist clowns.\"\n\nThat was a reference to a TV spot by Bishop superimposing the faces of McCready and other prominent Democrats on swaying clown figures.\n\nCynthia Brown, of Fayetteville, 50, is also attending the rally. Brown, who is black, said supporting Trump has been \"a pretty lonely experience\" for her. She added, \"But that's OK. I'm not a follower.\"\n\nWhile the stakes for the House are high, Trump's trademark rallies inevitably become more about him than the local candidate, as he uses the stage to settle political scores, sharpen attacks and take on perceived foes. After a light rally schedule of late, the president will have plenty of new material to work with.\n\nChief among them are the White House's worries about the impact an economic downturn could have on a president who has made a strong economy his central argument for a second term. Trump advisers worry that moderate Republican and independent voters who have been willing to give him a pass on some of his incendiary policies and rhetoric would blame him \u2014 and, in particular, his trade war with China \u2014 for slowing down the economy.\n\n\"We don't want no socialist clowns.\" \u2014 Trump rally attendee Diane Ezzell\n\nTrump has increasingly turned to culture-war issues to rev up his core supporters. He's leveled harsh criticism at majority African American cities, like Baltimore, and delivered repeated broadsides against four liberal Democratic congresswomen of color.\n\nThose attacks have been cheered by Trump's advisers, who are bullish on running a campaign critical of Democrats they cast as socialist and unpatriotic. But they went too far for many Republicans, who recoiled when the crowd at a Trump rally in Greenville, North Carolina, in July erupted into a \"send her back\" chant about Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\n\nIn the hours before Monday's rally, Trump flew to coastal North Carolina to inspect the damage left by Hurricane Dorian, but bad weather forced officials to scrap those plans. Instead, he received a briefing on Air Force One where Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper told him that three deaths are connected to the storm and that some 3,500 people are without power.\n\nMuch of the president's comments about the storm have been about defending his erroneous claim that Alabama was likely to face significant impact from it.\n\nMcCready has not had any public events in the district with Democratic presidential hopefuls, though any such appearances by candidates jostling to appeal to liberal voters might not have helped him in the moderate area. But former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., two rival candidates, have emailed fundraising solicitations on his behalf. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence will also campaign in the district on Monday for the Republican.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats captured 39 GOP-held House districts in the 2018 midterm elections, more than enough to give them majority control of the chamber.\n\nMuch of that turnover occurred in suburbs, largely in Democratic strongholds like California and New Jersey but also in red-leaning communities near places like Dallas, Oklahoma City and Atlanta. GOP alarm bells have been ringing about the suburbs ever since.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The stakes were unusually high ahead of President Trump's campaign rally in Fayetteville, N.C. on Monday night, with just hours to go until voters there head to the polls in a pivotal tossup\u00a0special election\u00a0that will\u00a0decide the winner of a long-contested -- and long-vacant -- House seat.", "authors": ["Gregg Re", "Trump Rally Attendee Diane Ezzell", "Gregg Re Is A Lawyer", "Editor Based In Los Angeles.
