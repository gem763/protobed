When you are in United, everything gets much bigger. There are more people watching, more people writing about the club than any other club.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n\u201cFor him it is probably nothing new, he himself has been a player there, then things went a little better for the club, but he knows exactly what it takes to be a player and how much pressure there is on us.\n\n\u201cThere is probably no danger to him.\u201d\n\nRio Ferdinand also thinks United will hold off the trigger for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"There's no way the club would have thought this would be rosy straight away, they're not naive enough to think that it was going to be a situation where he just changes it overnight,\" the United legend told talkSPORT.\n\n\"This is definitely something where there is going to be early pain, there is going to be a situation where the results are not going to go our way, especially with the new recruitment that they've started to go with younger players.\n\n\"That's why I don't see there being a change straight away, I'd be very surprised if I wake up, open a paper or an app and see that he has gone so quickly.\"", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's reign as Man Utd boss has been rumoured to be coming to a close but Victor Lindelof has had his say", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Manchester United Via Getty Imag", "Reuters", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20576383.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Leicester-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
