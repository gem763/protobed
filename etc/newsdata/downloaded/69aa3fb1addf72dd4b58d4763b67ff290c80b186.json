Now in its 10th year, the survey spotlights the importance of a planning mindset as people in their working years must shoulder the burden of funding their own retirement. The Wells Fargo Retirement study was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of Wells Fargo among 2,708 workers age 18 to 75 and 1,004 retirees.\n\nThe survey found several key characteristics that influence today\u2019s retiree, who \u2013 in this survey \u2013 is an average age of 70. Most striking, more than eight in 10 (86%) retirees fund their retirement primarily with Social Security or a pension; just 5% say personal savings, such as an IRA or a 401(k), is their main source of funding. By contrast, for younger generations the quality of their retirement will depend almost entirely on how much they save through vehicles such as a 401(k) or IRA. Indeed, 45% of Millennial workers say the top source of funding for their future retirement will come from an IRA or a 401(k), compared to just 25% who say they expect to rely on Social Security or a pension for their retirement income.\n\nPrimary Source for\n\nPaying\n\nRetirement Expenses Retiree Baby Boomer Generation X Millennial Generation Z 401(k) and or IRA 5% 22% 41% 45% 44% Social Security 64% 41% 21% 13% 16% Pension plan 22% 19% 16% 12% 4%\n\n\u201cOur survey clearly shows stark differences between current retirees and younger generations and how they will fund retirement,\u201d said Fredrik Axsater, head of the Institutional Client Group for Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM). \u201cFor those still in the workforce, saving for a viable retirement lies almost entirely in their own hands, which requires a vastly different strategy and approach. As an industry, we need to ensure that more workers take the necessary actions today to adequately fund their retirement tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTwo-Thirds of Workers with Student Loans Say Student Loan Burden Impedes Retirement Saving\n\nDespite recognition that saving and paying for retirement now rests with the individual, younger generations hold mixed views about whether they are saving enough. Moreover, financial challenges negatively impact the ability of nearly half of workers to adequately save, the survey found.\n\nOverall, just over half (55%) of workers say they are saving enough for retirement. By generation, 61% of baby boomers say they are saving enough, followed by Millennials (55%), Generation X (51%) and Generation Z (48%).\n\nDebt plays a crucial role in workers\u2019 ability to save, as 31% of Millennials say they have an \u201cunmanageable amount of debt,\u201d followed by Generation X (26%), Generation Z (25%) and baby boomers (14%). Additionally, among all workers, nearly half (46%) say they are putting off saving for retirement due to current financial challenges, and 67% of workers paying student loans say the burden of student loans is getting in the way of saving for retirement.\n\nAs a result, many workers appear to be falling well short of what they will need to fund their retirement. Twenty-nine percent have personally saved less than $25,000; 13% have saved between $25,000 and $100,000; and 11% have saved between $100,000 and $250,000 \u2013 which means that more than half (54%) of workers have saved less than $250,000 for retirement. Moreover, 32% of workers can\u2019t estimate what they have saved for retirement \u2013 and only 15% of workers have saved $250,000 or more, according to the survey.\n\nLooking at workers on a median basis (including those who have saved $0), baby boomers have saved $160,000; Generation X $66,000; Millennials $10,000; and Generation Z $2,000.\n\nPersonal Savings\n\nLevels by\n\nGeneration Retiree Baby Boomer Generation X Millennial Generation Z Less than $25K 21% 16% 22% 45% 49% $25K \u2013 <$100K 10% 11% 14% 14% 8% $100K \u2013 <$250K 10% 12% 15% 8% 3% $250K or more 16% 29% 16% 4% 4% Not Sure 43% 32% 33% 30% 36%\n\nOn the bright side, younger workers are starting to save much earlier than older generations of workers. Though baby boomers started saving around age 36 on average, Generation X started at age 31, Millennials at age 25 and Generation Z at 18, according to the survey. Today\u2019s retirees began saving for retirement at age 40 on average.\n\nSocial Insecurity\n\nFear that Social Security may not be available for retirement represents a concern across all working generations in the survey, with 71% indicating they are \u201cafraid\u201d it won\u2019t be available when they retire. Just over six in 10 workers (63%) say they would have no idea what they would do if Social Security were not available \u201cwhen they need it,\u201d a concern that jumps to 71% for current retirees.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today\u2019s retirees are the last generation in the United States to live a retirement shaped by the forces of the prior century, standing in stark contrast to baby boomers, Generation X, Millennials and even Generation Z, according to the 2019 Wells Fargo Retirement study, which examines the attitudes and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
