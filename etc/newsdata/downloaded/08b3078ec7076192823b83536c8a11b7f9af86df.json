She suggested that organizers opted to invite survivors whose stories were deemed \u201crisk-free for the SBC.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have picked those who don\u2019t ask anything of them at this point,\u201d said Brown, who has been pushing the SBC to create an independently run database listing pastors and other church personnel who have been credibly accused of abuse.\n\nThe conference is being organized by the SBC\u2019s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, which holds a national meeting every year in its role as the SBC\u2019s public policy arm. It decided in April to scrap its planned theme, \u201cGospel Courage,\u201d and instead devote the entire meeting to the sex-abuse crisis wracking the SBC and other churches.\n\nThe commission\u2019s president, the Rev. Russell Moore, says he and his colleagues sought a diverse array of speakers, and are urging them to be \u201ccandid and forthright.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can understand skepticism from all sorts of people, given the track record of the church, especially over the past several years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conference is not intended to produce new policies or recommendations. Its goal, Moore said, is to provide churches with expert advice on how to prevent abuse and support abuse survivors.\n\nDue to multiple scandals, sex abuse became a major issue for the SBC in 2018. Its president, the Rev. J.D. Greear, formed an advisory group to draft recommendation s on how to confront the problem.\n\nThe crisis intensified this year, in part due to articles by the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio Express-News asserting that hundreds of Southern Baptist clergy and staff had been accused of sexual misconduct over the past 20 years. Many of them returned to church duties, the articles said, and more than 700 victims were left with little in the way of justice or apologies.\n\nAt the SBC\u2019s national meeting in June in Birmingham, Alabama, Greear issued an emotional apology for the crisis as he shared a stage with tearful survivors of abuse.\n\nAmong the most prominent invitees to the upcoming conference is attorney/activist Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to go public with sexual assault complaints against now-imprisoned former sports doctor Larry Nassar.\n\n\u201cLooking at the lineup of speakers, there are some incredibly important voices, but there are others who don\u2019t have credibility in the survivor network,\u201d said Denhollander, who attends a Reformed Baptist church in Louisville, Kentucky. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a very sharp divide between those who want to deal with the problem honestly and those who want to preserve the status quo.\u201d\n\nAnother scheduled speaker is Boz Tchividjian, an attorney who is the grandson of evangelist Billy Graham and who heads GRACE, an organization working to combat sexual abuse in faith-based organizations.\n\nTchividjian has close ties with many abuse survivors and says he understands many of their concerns about the SBC\u2019s resolve in combating this problem. He said he initially wrestled with his decision before agreeing to speak, but intends to be \u201cconstructively direct\u201d about how the SBC is fueling such concerns among many people who were abused within SBC churches.\n\n\u201cI think the SBC must go through a season of substantive lament, learning and changes if it ever wants to become a genuine leader in preventing and addressing all forms of abuse,\u201d said Tchividjian. \u201cI want to remain hopeful for change, but time will be the true test.\u201d\n\nPsychologist Diane Langberg, who runs a clinic near Philadelphia, will address the conference on how to help support abuse survivors. She\u2019s an expert on abuse and other traumas occurring in the context of Christian churches, and says she wants to provide \u201ca strong voice\u201d at the conference on behalf of victims.\n\n\u201cThis is a systemic issue - and it\u2019s going to take years for a system to change,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like turning a huge ship. I want to strengthen the voices calling for the ship to turn, so they do it strongly and clearly, and know it\u2019s a long haul.\u201d\n\nAmong abuse survivors, there are sharply contrasting views about the SBC\u2019s anti-abuse efforts.\n\nJules Woodson, a Colorado Springs-based flight attendant, says she was sexually assaulted by her youth pastor in Texas two decades ago at age 17 and received no support after reporting the incident to her senior pastors. Only in 2018 did Woodson file a police report, eventually prompting the former youth pastor to apologize and resign from his current church position.\n\nThe upcoming conference, Woodson says, \u201cis giving off a false hope that the SBC is taking this seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not seen genuine repentance or genuine moves toward change,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all words right now - it\u2019s lip service.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Megan Lively of Wilson, North Carolina, says she\u2019s been solidly supported by SBC leaders since identifying herself as a key figure in a 2003 sexual-assault incident that contributed to last year\u2019s ouster of the Rev. Paige Patterson as president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Patterson was faulted for discouraging Lively from filing a report with police after she told school administrators she\u2019d been raped by a fellow student while attending Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Patterson was president of the school at the time.\n\nLively, one of the scheduled speakers at the conference, says she doesn\u2019t consider herself a \u201csafe option\u201d for the organizers.\n\n\u201cI know that SBC leaders have listened to women inside and outside the church,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have listened to me. I have aggravated them.\u201d\n\nAdded Lively, \u201cIt\u2019s more important to stay involved in the process from within than to demand change from the outside.\u201d\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention encompasses more than 47,000 individual churches. It had 14.8 million members in 2018.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Entangled in a multifaceted sex-abuse crisis, the Southern Baptist Convention is preparing to host a high-profile conference on the topic that has kindled skepticism even among some of the scheduled speakers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Crary"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/southern_baptists_sex_abuse_86252_c0-198-5472-3388_s1770x1032.jpg?96187cd75839279a41bda201f18504f79a748519", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
