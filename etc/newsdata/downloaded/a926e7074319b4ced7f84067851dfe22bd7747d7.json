We spoke about many things. So I think you read it that nobody pushed me.\"\n\nTrump then piped up: \u201cIn other words, no pressure.\u201d\n\nTrump and Zelenskiy offered tense jokes and subtle jabs during a televised meeting at the United Nations that came just hours after the White House released details of the July conversation that showed Trump urging Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens. That call, and a whistleblower complaint raising red flags about its contents, were catalysts in the House formally launching impeachment proceedings against Trump on Tuesday.\n\nIn the middle of the controversy is hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that Trump reportedly asked his acting chief of staff to put on hold just days before his phone call with Zelenskiy. While Trump has denied that a quid pro quo took place between the two leaders, Democrats accused Trump of betraying his oath of office in asking a foreign government to investigate a political opponent. Biden is a front-runner among the Democrats running against Trump in next year's election.\n\nIn the White House memo released Wednesday morning, Trump does not explicitly link the release of that aid with an investigation into Biden, though he does launch into an ask for a \u201cfavor\u201d from his Ukrainian counterpart in response to Zelenskiy saying he\u2019d like to purchase a new batch of missiles from the U.S.\n\nThe White House memo introduced a new twist to the Trump-Zelenskiy story, that Trump informed the Ukrainian president that he planned to enlist U.S. Attorney General William Barr to assist in gathering potential dirt on Biden.\n\nTrump has asserted repeatedly that his only intention in seeking a probe of the Bidens was to help Zelenskiy fulfill his campaign promise of rooting out corruption in Ukraine. The president and his supporters have argued that it is Biden who was corrupt in pushing for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who'd been widely criticized by the international community. That prosecutor is said to have been looking into an energy company for which Hunter Biden sat on the board, but there is no evidence that Biden himself was under investigation.\n\nBut Zelenskiy, for his part, underscored that Ukraine is an independent country, explaining on Wednesday that \"I can't push anyone.\"\n\nStill, he said through a translator, \"we have a new prosecutor general in the Ukraine, a highly professional man with a western education. He's free to investigate anything he considers and deems appropriate,\" adding that \"we have many more issues to care about and tackle\" including corruption.", "description": "Trump and Zelenskiy offered tense jokes and subtle jabs during a televised meeting at the United Nations.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Paul Dallison", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Natasha Bertrand", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171052767-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
