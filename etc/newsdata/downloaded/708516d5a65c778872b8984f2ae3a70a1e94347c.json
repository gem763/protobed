Looters took to the streets targeting small shops primarily owned and operated by foreign entrepreneurs as violence spread, causing millions of rands in damage and significant losses for business owners.\n\nThere is no small irony in the fact that many people employed in those stores are South African and join the long list of the unemployed. Criminal opportunism, however, pays no heed to the concerns of others.\n\nWomen, fed up by a rising tide of femicide and attacks on young children, laid siege to the Cape Town International Convention Centre, seeking to embarrass the South African government into some sort of action to harshly punish culprits and improve protection of the vulnerable.\n\n\n\nInside, delegates spoke about the fourth industrial revolution and its future benefits.\n\nFascinating for those allowed inside. Meaningless to those trapped in the brutal reality of surviving South Africa\u2019s harsh realities.\n\nThe good news of a better than expected bounce in Q2 growth was overshadowed by a surge in anger at a state which is seen to be failing its citizens.\n\nImagine if we added load-shedding into the mix now?\n\nIt would most certainly drive the country into despair.\n\nEskom bragged this week that it had gone 160 days without forced blackouts. The fact that it has only one job and that is to generate enough energy to support growth, seems to escape the battered utility.\n\nThe debt-ridden state-owned enterprise warned, however, that it was unable to guarantee supply as it begins the regular summer maintenance of its creaking infrastructure.\n\nThat is a terrifying prospect.\n\nThe impact of load shedding was a primary contributor to the first quarter economic contraction and the spike in unemployment to an average 29.2% currently. Another round of power outages now would cause considerable further despair.\n\nEskom\u2019s inability to generate sufficient power cheaply is symptomatic of broader governance failings. Abject poverty and the rising tide of unemployment is a governance failure. The fact that significant numbers of women feel compelled to protest angrily for something as fundamental as the right to personal security is yet another failure of governance.\n\nThe fact that the country\u2019s intelligence agencies, previously so effective at running up bogus spy allegations to help ex-president Jacob Zuma dispose of his political enemies, is unable to discern the origins of highly organised and apparently pre-planned looting sprees is another failure.\n\nTo have police so vastly outnumbered on the streets that they are unable to contain hoards of criminal gangs stealing from foreigners is also a catastrophic failure.\n\nNo number of government and private sector condemnations and other platitudes will fix the problems. That requires skill, hard work and considerable political will to crack down hard on failings.\n\nThe sentiment expressed by the SAMint this week as it promoted a new collectors range of coins commemorating 25 years of constitutional democracy was lost, as the brutal daily reality of far too many people in this country overshadowed the great achievement.\n\nIt failed to grasp the public mood. As did the World Economic Forum Africa gathering which has entered its second day of proceedings focussing on the impact of, and opportunities a fourth industrial revoloution might bring.\n\nUntil government finds a way of simultaneously addressing the immediate needs of its people, its high level grandstanding on the future is likely to fall on deaf ears.\n\nBruce Whitfield is a multi-platform award-winning financial journalist and broadcaster.\n\n\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Bruce Whitfield:", "description": "The good news of a better than expected bounce in Q2 growth was overshadowed by a surge in anger at a state which is seen to be failing its citizens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8118/6189b7db857a4b1e8e03780fd1d10f43.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
