The contract was on track for a 4.3% weekly advance after ending Thursday at a nearly one-month high.\n\nDecember Brent crude BRNZ19, -0.05%, the global benchmark, was off 22 cents, or 0.4%, at $61.45 on ICE Futures Europe, paring its weekly rise to 3.4%.\n\nThe driver for gains this week came from the surprise drop in U.S. oil and product inventories reported by the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday, said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, in a note.\n\nThe EIA on Wednesday reported that U.S. crude supplies fell for the first time in six weeks, down 1.7 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 18. Separately, supplies of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, fell by 1 million barrels for the week. Petroleum products gasoline and distillate also saw declines in stockpiles.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. crude draw ended a run of above average builds brought on by deep refinery maintenance and challenging export economics,\u201d said Robbie Fraser, senior commodity analyst at Schneider Electric, in a daily note. \u201cAs the U.S. hovers near net exporter territory for combined crude and products, export volumes have become an increasingly key component of weekly inventory swings.\u201d\n\nEven so, \u201cheadwinds remain in the form of potential demand weakness with 2019 already showing a clear decline in demand growth from recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crude market continues to rely heavily on major emerging markets for new demand, which means high exposure to a slowing Indian economy and any negative impact to Chinese demand amid ongoing trade tensions.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, disruptions to output in the North Sea earlier this week also contributed to oil\u2019s trading tone, Patterson noted. News reports said workers from a North Sea oil platform were evacuated this week as a precaution following a structural inspection.\n\nTraders will be paying attention Friday afternoon to the latest weekly tally of U.S. drilling rigs from oil-field services firm Baker Hughes BKR, +0.90%.\n\nSpeculation is also swirling around the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, namely Russia, and their willingness to extend and deepen an agreement on output cuts that\u2019s due to expire in April.\n\nWhile Russian officials have expressed reluctance, such reticence has become almost a \u201crite of passage in the run-up to OPEC meetings,\u201d said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a note.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u201cyielded a host of lucrative new deals that should sufficiently compensate for curbing output,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile Saudi Arabia seems focused on ensuring all members honor their commitments, we think a deeper cut is very much a live option given growing demand concerns and domestic fiscal needs.\u201d\n\nBack on Nymex, November gasoline RBX19, +0.15% was off 0.1% at $1.661 a gallon\u2014trading 2.5% higher for the week, while November heating oil HOX19, -0.59% was off 0.9% at $1.969 a gallon, poised for a weekly rise of about 1.1%. November natural gas NGX19, -0.47% was off 0.8% at $2.298 per million British thermal units, for a potential weekly loss of 1%.\n\nThe formation of Tropical Depression Seventeen on Friday serves are a reminder that the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs through Nov. 30, is far from over. Traders will watch for any possible disruptions to energy production in the Gulf of Mexico. The center of the cylone is expected to \u201cmove across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico this afternoon and then move over the northern Gulf cost [late Friday] or Saturday morning,\u201d according to the National Hurricane Center.", "description": "Oil futures make modest moves Friday, seesawing between modest gains and losses, as concerns over a slowdown in energy demand persist, but renewed supply...", "authors": ["Myra P.
