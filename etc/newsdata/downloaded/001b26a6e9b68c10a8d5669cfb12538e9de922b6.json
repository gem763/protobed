Al-Muhajir was in Jarablus to facilitate Baghdadi's entry to Euphrates Shield area,' referring to a zone in northern Syria controlled by Turkey's Syria proxies.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Trump said Baghdadi was killed, dying 'like a dog,' in a daring, nighttime raid by US special forces deep in northwest Syria.\n\nTrump said that US forces killed a 'large number' of IS militants during the raid, which culminated in Baghdadi cornered in a tunnel, where he detonated a suicide vest.\n\nThe operation to kill Baghdadi took place near a small village in northwestern Syria called Barisha, more than a 100 kilometres west of Ain al-Baydah.", "description": "Footage circulated on social media this evening purports to show a helicopter raid by US special forces that took place in the border town of Turkish-controlled Jarablus.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/22/20254656-0-image-a-30_1572300288033.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
