New research, however, shows women who become stressed during pregnancy are at greater risk of having children with a personality disorder. That makes me wonder how many mums-to-be this leaves out.\n\nLet\u2019s hope a lot because children whose mothers experience severe stress while pregnant are 10 times more likely to develop a behavioural problem by the age of 30. And those mums who are moderately stressed are four times more likely.\n\nExperts believe this is because stress in pregnancy, with high levels of the associated hormone cortisol, affects the way the infant brain develops.\n\nPersonality disorders include a wide range of behavioural problems with disturbed thinking, impulsive behaviour and aggression.\n\nRoughly one in 20 people in the UK have this condition alongside are other mental problems, such as depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Study leader Ross Brannigan, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, says: \u201cThis study highlights the importance of providing mental health and stress support to both pregnant women\n\nand families during the antenatal and postnatal period.\u201d\n\nThe Finnish research team tracked 3,626 people born in 1975 and 1976 in Helsinki who were assessed in 2005, when they were 29 or 30 years old. During that time 40 of the 3,626 in the sample were diagnosed with personality disorder.\n\nAfter taking into account parental psychiatric history and smoking, both of which influence the risk of personality disorder, the authors found children exposed to severe maternal stress were 9.53 times more likely to develop the problem (with moderate stress 3.59 times more likely) as those whose mothers weren\u2019t stressed at all during pregnancy.\n\nWe already know there are brain differences between those with and without personality disorders, and that prenatal stress impacts infant brain development. It also affects\n\nthe mother-child relationship in the crucial early months of bonding.\n\nDr Trudi Seneviratne, chairman of the perinatal faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, has said: \u201cPregnancy can be a stressful time and this study shows the importance of ensuring mums-to-be have access to the mental health support they need.\n\n\u201cNHS England has dramatically improved access to perinatal mental health services in recent times \u2013 and these findings show how important it is for them to continue investing in this area.\u201d\n\nI know, however, that post-natal mental health support often falls short of what mothers need.\n\nDaily Mirror news", "description": "New research shows women who become stressed during pregnancy are at greater risk of having children with a personality disorder", "authors": ["Miriam Stoppard"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641763.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS147878379.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
