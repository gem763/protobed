The Extinction Rebellion protests have been largely peaceful and brought vital attention to the climate emergency \u2013 the most important issue facing the world.\n\n\u2018Any criminal acts should of course be handled by police, but an outright ban is wrong and completely contrary to Britain\u2019s long-held traditions of policing by consent, freedom of speech, and the right to protest.\u2019\n\nIn a statement, the Met said: \u2018Any assembly linked to the Extinction Rebellion \u2018Autumn Uprising\u2019\u2026must cease their protest(s) within London by 9pm on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Protestors have been notified, and given an opportunity to leave the site. Anyone who fails to comply with the condition is liable for arrest and prosecution.\u2019\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor added: \u2018These conditions have been imposed due to the continued breaches of the section 14 condition previously implemented, and ongoing serious disruption to the community.\n\n\u2018Since the beginning of this operation officers have been working hard to keep London moving. There have been more than 1,400 arrests, and a number of people have been charged. The policing operation continues, and we will continue to take action against anyone engaged in unlawful protests at locations targeted by Extinction Rebellion.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
