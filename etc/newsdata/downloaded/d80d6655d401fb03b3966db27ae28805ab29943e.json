On Wednesday, at a press event at its Seattle headquarters, the company is expected to announce new products and services that will help it maintain its position as the market leader. These are likely to include a wide range of Alexa-infused products for different places in the home and at different prices, as well as updates to Alexa's functions.\n\nOver the past five years, the market for smart speakers that use virtual assistants \u2014 Amazon's Alexa and its Echo smart speakers in particular \u2014 has ballooned. According to data from tech market researcher Canalys, companies including Amazon, Google, and Baidu shipped 26.1 million smart speakers in the second quarter of this year. Amazon is sitting on top of this market: Canalys reports Amazon shipped a quarter these speakers, or an estimated 6.6 million between April and June. (China's Baidu took a distant second place with roughly 17% of the market, shipping 4.5 million speakers).\n\nAmazon has been working to keep its momentum: Last September , Amazon introduced Alexa-controlled products ranging from the expected (more Echo smart speakers) to the surprising (a $60 AmazonBasics microwave that can warm food via voice commands \u2014 such as, \"Alexa, heat up one cup of coffee\" \u2014 when used with an Echo device).\n\nThis year, analysts anticipate products that will go in your house and, perhaps, even on your body.", "description": "When Amazon first introduced its virtual assistant in 2014, it was hard to imagine that, several years later, you'd have to be careful where you utter the name \"Alexa.\"", "authors": ["Rachel Metz", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924151744-01-dave-limp-amazon-product-event-2018-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
