Human subjugation is not a \u2018theme\u2019 for a wedding,\u2019 added someone on a Facebook comment.\n\n\u2018Wow, this is deeply disturbing. \u2018Praise be\u2019? Seriously? I love the show, but this photo is truly puke-worthy,\u2019 said another.\n\n\u2018A white woman cosplaying oppression on her wedding day..this is too much,\u2019 wrote someone else on Twitter.\n\nPhotographers Shawn Van Daele and Clint Russell have come out defending the image, saying that the whole point was to start a difficult conversation.\n\n\u2018To all who are upset by this image: We actually totally agree! Mission: accomplished!\u2019 wrote Shawn.\n\n\u2018Everyone is talking about this issue now, rather than binging on a television series and then not doing anything about what they\u2019re so worked up over until the next season comes out in the spring.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s sad is that the oppression and hatred, the division, fear and breakdown of humanity and compassion is being perpetuated in every one of these comments.\n\n\u2018Take a step back and consider you may not actually know the facts, either \u2013 that this image was created and put out by a pair of \u201cGender Traitors\u201d who are no strangers to many of the subplots of oppression, violence, and inequality that run through Margaret\u2019s brilliant work.\u2019\n\nThe dystopian TV drama stars Elisabeth Moss (Picture: George Kraychyk/Hulu)\n\nShawn said the angry reaction was sad and exactly as expected. He said it was a missed opportunity for people to educate themselves and engage in an issue rather than just being \u2018keyboard warriors\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We\u2019d love to see you out in the streets participating in women\u2019s marches, supporting equal rights for everyone regardless of their sexual orientation, and so many other important causes, instead of sitting here scrolling through Instagram, knee-jerking your way through comments,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018So you\u2019re correct \u2013 it\u2019s gross, disgusting, and a horrible reality that is rampantly becoming more \u2018real\u2019 in the world day by day \u2013 and comment by comment.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no more \u201cus\u201d \u2013 only division and hatred, and no more curiosity to learn, to help, to actively become engaged in correcting humanity\u2019s breakdown instead of instantly attacking. Congrats for adding to that today!\n\n\u2018Why exactly are you offended? Have you asked yourself? And what are you actively doing about it in the real world? We\u2019re thrilled that this is starting a conversation!\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re not sure that Kendra and Torsten are as happy about their wedding day becoming a political moment as their photographers seem to be.\n\nDo you have an amazing wedding story you\u2019d like to share?
