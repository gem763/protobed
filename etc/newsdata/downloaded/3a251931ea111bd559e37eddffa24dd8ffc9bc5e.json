Burisma may have come across your news feed in recent weeks because Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, sat on the board of the company while it was being investigated for corruption. He reportedly received hundreds of thousands of dollars for the gig.\n\nREAD: Statement from the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office about today's announcement. Lots of confusion around whether Burisma and Biden being investigated. So, here it is in English: pic.twitter.com/wEwipB4IpH \u2014 Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) October 4, 2019\n\nRuslan Ryaboshapka, Ukraine\u2019s general prosecutor, said that the review is one of at least 15 past probes that had been closed or dismissed. He insisted no foreign or Ukrainian politician influenced his decision to restart the audit.\n\n\u201cThere are 15 cases where Zlochevsky, Kurchenko and other people and companies could be involved or could be targets for investigation,\u201d Ryaboshapka said. \u201cWe are now looking again at all cases that were closed or broken up or were investigated earlier to make a decision to reconsider those instances where illegal procedural decisions were made.\u201d\n\nA whistleblower complaint against President Trump accused him of quid pro quo for asking Ukrainian President Zelensky to look into the Bidens' ties to Ukraine. In doing so, it cast a spotlight on the former vice president and claims that he tried to get former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko fired while he was investigating Burisma.\n\nBiden had told the press that he never discussed Hunter's overseas business dealings, but, to quote Nickelback, look at this photograph.\n\nDemocrats are more interested in Trump's conversation with President Zelensky. To them, it was enough to launch an impeachment inquiry.", "description": ".10/04/2019 12:56:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/277/dfaba410-115a-4b40-8fe0-1d50c845e967.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
