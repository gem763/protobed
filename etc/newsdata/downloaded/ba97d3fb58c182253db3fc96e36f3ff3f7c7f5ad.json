The moves come as Harris is hemorrhaging cash and in danger of lacking the resources to mount a competitive bid against better-funded rivals in Iowa. The overhaul will touch nearly every facet of Harris\u2019 operation, with layoffs or re-deployments coming at headquarters, as well as in New Hampshire, Nevada and her home state of California, a Super Tuesday prize that her advisers once viewed as a big asset. Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez will cut his own salary, according to the memo, which was just over $10,000 a month in the third quarter of the year. Harris\u2019 consultants will also have their payments reduced and the campaign plans to trim and renegotiate other contracts to slash overhead.\n\nTeam Harris is portraying the candidate will make it to the Iowa Caucuses, which will be held in February, but the slowdown of her campaign more than three months out indicates otherwise.\n\nThe news of the cuts come shortly after Harris was caught saying she was going to \"move to f*cking Iowa,\" where she has spent months campaigning.\n\nSo, how did we get here? A flashback to earlier this year:\n\nNot a \"top tier\" candidate anymore.", "description": ".10/30/2019 19:18:33PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/281cb513-d42f-488b-9962-f339b8d4b786.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
