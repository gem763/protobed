But his latest documentary, \u201cCountry Music,\u201d which premieres Sept. 15 on PBS, presented a new set of challenges.\n\nIts very subject matter was a turnoff to some people, perceived at times as a \u201ccountry cousin,\u201d Mr. Burns says, a musical \u201cbottomland not befitting the attention of sophisticates and, God forbid, scholars.\u201d The filmmakers wanted to convey a level of nuance, more complex than trains and whiskey, heartbreak and going home to Mama. The music\u2019s story mirrored America\u2019s, expressed by performers who often echoed their tragic personal narratives in songs.\n\nThe 16-hour, eight-part series features all the Burns hallmarks: evocative music, leisurely interviews and archival images made famous in works like \u201cBaseball\u201d (1994) and \u201cThe Civil War\u201d (1990). Beneath the historical turmoil depicted on screen, there is a nostalgic faith in America. Many Burns films feature academics. Here, the only scholar is Bill Malone, author of \u201cCountry Music USA,\u201d first published in 1968. Talking heads include Dolly Parton, Vince Gill, Loretta Lynn, Wynton Marsalis, Elvis Costello and Rosanne Cash.\n\nCountry music had so many influences and reached so many places that the initial structuring of the film was an organizational feat. With Mr. Burns presiding over several films at once, that fell to writer-producer Dayton Duncan, who has worked with him for nearly 30 years, including on films about national parks, Mark Twain and Lewis and Clark. Growing up in Iowa, Mr. Duncan didn\u2019t listen to country music, but in the 1970s he leapt into it, partly by discovering Emmylou Harris, a fixture in the series. In 2011 he and his team began reading hundreds of books and listening to records.\n\nThe next year, deep in research, Mr. Duncan drove to Portsmouth, N.H., to meet Merle Haggard, who had been ill but was back on the road. He presented the singer with a copy of their 2012 documentary, \u201cThe Dust Bowl,\u201d and they talked for an hour on the tour bus. Haggard was a legend for his 50 years of music, his parents\u2019 migration from Oklahoma to California, his time in San Quentin and his five marriages. Mr. Duncan wasn\u2019t yet scheduling interviews but knew he needed this man on camera. He got him, before Haggard died four years later. Of the 101 people whose interviews were used in the film, 20 have died.\n\n\u201cI staged the interviews sort of based on actuarial tables,\u201d Mr. Duncan said. \u201cWe went to the oldest ones first.\u201d\n\nMerle Haggard, with Dayton Duncan in December 2014, spoke with the filmmakers about his 50 years in music.

The stopping point was critical: The filmmakers are historians, and history needs time to settle. \u201cWe could have a great conversation about whether Blake Shelton or Taylor Swift will endure as significant artists in 20 years,\u201d Mr. Duncan says. \u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d\n\nHaggard made sure the filmmakers were aware of Jimmie Rodgers and Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys. He mentioned the lesser-known Maddox Brothers and Rose, who were among the creators of California\u2019s \u201cBakersfield Sound\u201d\u2014a rival to the Nashville music scene. Haggard also cited Emmett Miller, father of the classic \u201cLovesick Blues,\u201d who performed in blackface at minstrel shows.\n\n\u201cCountry Music\u201d moves through the Depression and wars and business and the women\u2019s movement as well as blues, gospel, jazz, R&B, soul and folk. Rock \u2019n\u2019 roll terrified Nashville\u2019s overlords even while the early Beatles sang Buck Owens\u2019s \u201cAct Naturally\u201d and the likes of Gram Parsons and Bob Dylan further blended country and rock. Viewers also meet Marty Stuart, the unofficial curator of history and artifacts in Nashville. Mr. Stuart, a musician, is a link between Americana/roots music and mainstream commercial country\u2014which often are at odds.\n\nDolly Parton with Dayton Duncan, center, and Ken Burns in November 2016, is among the performers interviewed for \u2018Country Music.\u2019 Photo: Katy Haas\n\nCountry singers and songwriters resisted barriers, opting simply to make American music. The filmmakers point out the many African-American influences: The banjo came from Africa. Hank Williams, Rodgers and A.P. Carter all had African-American mentors.\n\nAmong audiences, racial divides persisted for years. For decades, there were few black faces in the crowds at the Grand Ole Opry , a Nashville institution. When Charley Pride began crooning hits in the mid-1960s, many were shocked to learn that this son of a Mississippi sharecropper was black. His label wouldn\u2019t release his version of \u201cGreen, Green Grass of Home\u201d as a single because the song refers to \u201csweet Mary\u201d with \u201chair of gold.\u201d\n\nIn 1962, when Ray Charles first won creative control of one of his albums, he named it \u201cModern Sounds in Country and Western Music\u201d and in 1962 sent \u201cI Can\u2019t Stop Lovin\u2019 You\u201d to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. In New York, jazz great Charlie Parker would play country on the jukebox between sets and tell skeptics: \u201cListen to the stories.\u201d\n\nSome of the musicians in \u201cCountry Music,\u201d resurface in very different places. Willie Nelson wrote \u201cCrazy\u201d for Patsy Cline, but was frustrated in Nashville, where producers had him wear turtlenecks and sing lush arrangements. He and Waylon Jennings grew their hair and beards and Mr. Nelson headed home to Texas. They became stars of \u201coutlaw\u201d country and Mr. Nelson became even more famous by singing American-songbook standards like \u201cStardust.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountry Music\u201d rests on two building blocks, which the filmmakers call Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. Members of the Carter Family, exemplars of the latter camp, were about church, home and Appalachian hills, with songs such as \u201cKeep on the Sunny Side.\u201d The rougher, Saturday Night strain was personified by the vagabond Jimmie Rodgers, whose songs such as \u201cMule Skinner Blues\u201d chronicled riding the rails, drinking, gambling and landing in jail. The two camps are reflected in the tumultuous lives of Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Bill Monroe, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Tammy Wynette and others.\n\nJohnny Cash looms large in the film as a giant tangle of both strains, tortured by pain and pills and at times seeking redemption through the gospel music of his Arkansas youth. Cash, who married a Carter Family daughter, June, in 1968, made a hit out of Kris Kristofferson\u2019s lyrical hangover song \u201cSunday Morning Coming Down.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo us he\u2019s the avatar,\u201d Mr. Duncan says. \u201cIt\u2019s a wide-arm embrace of all the different styles of music and the social and personal conflicts of the 20th century.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Cash, the filmmakers even bent their decision not to go beyond 1996. They included his death\u2014in 2003\u2014in the final episode of \u201cCountry Music.\u201d", "description": "In a new PBS series, the director of \u201cThe Civil War,\u201d \u201cBaseball\u201d and other documentaries, portrays America\u2019s development through the lens of country music.", "authors": ["Richard Turner"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105666/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
