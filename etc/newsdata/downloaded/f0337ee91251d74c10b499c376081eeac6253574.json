The number was eventually taken down to 6,500 by July 2019, as London police sorted through the backlog.\n\n\"At the time of our inspection City of London Police told us that they were actively working to solve this problem,\" the HMICFRS said in its audit published today.\n\nA London police spokesperson told the Guardian that the issue was linked to an IBM system and that they're working with the vendor to address the issue.\n\nOfficers are now belatedly contacting victims to acknowledge reports and follow through on inquiries.\n\nOverall, with a few isolated incidents, the HMICFRS report [PDF] found that UK police have \"a well-established national strategy for dealing with the threat from cyber-dependent crime\" with \"efficient working arrangements between law enforcement agencies.\"", "description": "Over 9,000 cybercrime reports got quarantined by accident.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/01/10/cbb237a4-164e-4414-a120-4aa9541549d0/thumbnail/770x578/75719a965ca082845cc64e6b4a6d5832/screenshot-2019-01-10-at-17-37-46.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
