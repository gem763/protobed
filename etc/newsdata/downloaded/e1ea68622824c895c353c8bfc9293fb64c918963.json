Boris Johnson Denies Lying to Queen Over Suspension: Brexit Update\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson won some respite from a series of setbacks when a court ruled on Thursday morning that a no-deal Brexit wouldn\u2019t violate the peace accord in Northern Ireland. It came after Scottish judges said his suspension of Parliament was unlawful and he was accused of lying to the Queen, a charge he denied.\n\nThe prime minister is trying to keep his Brexit government on track with a relentless focus on domestic issues ahead of a general election expected in the fall. His government was also forced to reveal the full scale of the damage a no-deal Brexit could cause to the U.K.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nGovernment published no-deal Brexit planning documents late Wednesday ahead of Parliament-imposed deadline: U.K. Warns of Protests, Chaotic Border Scenes in No-Deal Brexit\n\nA Belfast court ruled that a no-deal Brexit would not break the Good Friday Peace accords\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said the government is working to mitigate no-deal Brexit risks\n\nFormer Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd wants Tory rebels readmitted before she considers rejoining Conservative Party\n\nJohnson \u2018Hopeful\u2019 of Deal With EU (11:20 a.m.)\n\nIn his TV interview, Boris Johnson said he\u2019s \u201cvery hopeful\u201d of securing a deal with his European counterparts at an Oct. 17-18 summit in Brussels and that he\u2019s \u201cworking very hard\u201d to secure one.\n\n\u201cWe can see the rough area of landing space of how you could do it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt will be tough, it will be hard, but I think we can get there.\u201d\n\nCrucially, Johnson said, if the U.K. can\u2019t secure a deal, then \u201cwe will be ready to come out on Oct. 31, deal or no deal.\u201d\n\nJohnson wins in Belfast Court (11:15 a.m.)\n\nA Northern Irish court ruled that a no-deal Brexit wouldn\u2019t violate the Good Friday peace accord, handing Johnson a legal victory in one of a string of cases related to his plans to leave the European Union.\n\nJudge Bernard McCloskey issued a ruling Thursday in Belfast. The case is set to be immediately appealed to a higher court in Northern Ireland before moving to the U.K. Supreme Court next week.\n\nJohnson Denies Lying to Queen (11:10 a.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d didn\u2019t lie to the Queen when he asked her to suspend or prorogue Parliament, because the government needs a new session to put forward its agenda.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge number of things that we want to get on with and do,\u201d Johnson said in pooled television interview. \u201cWe need a Queen\u2019s speech, we need to get on with these.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the release of the Operation Yellowhammer document setting out projected outcomes of a no-deal Brexit, he stressed it\u2019s \u201ca worst-case scenario.\u201d\n\nThe document was \u201cwritten by planners to make sure that we do everything we need to do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have to come out on Oct. 31 with no deal, we will be ready. The ports will be ready and the farming communities will be ready.\u201d\n\nEU Parliament Open to N. Ireland-Only Backstop (10:30 a.m.)\n\nThe European Parliament has signaled the European Union\u2019s willingness to change the contentious Irish border backstop in the Brexit deal to make it apply solely to Northern Ireland rather than the whole U.K.\n\nAccording to the text of a resolution that EU lawmakers will vote on next week seen by Bloomberg, the parliament \u201cexpresses its readiness to revert to a Northern Ireland-only backstop but stresses that it will not give consent to a withdrawal agreement without a backstop.\u201d\n\nWhile the parliament doesn\u2019t have any formal role in the negotiations with the U.K., it does have a full veto over the final deal. In the resolution, it says it won\u2019t hold a vote until after the U.K. Parliament has approved the agreement.\n\nThe EU has, in recent days, signaled that British negotiators seem to be moving toward accepting a Northern Ireland-only backstop. This would keep the province aligned to the EU\u2019s customs union and single-market rules to prevent a hard border with the Irish Republic. In the current deal, rejected three times by British MPs, the whole U.K. would remain in a customs union.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday denied he was ready to accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop, saying it wouldn\u2019t work for the U.K.\n\nRudd Wants All 21 Tory Rebels Readmitted (8:50 a.m.)\n\nFormer Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who quit Johnson\u2019s government and the Parliamentary Conservative Party at the weekend, said she would wait to see how the 21 Tory MPs expelled from the party last week are treated before deciding if she would rejoin.\n\nRudd was responding to reports that some of the rebels have been offered a way back into the party. She said she\u2019d been struck at the effective organization of the group of MPs, who were expelled for voting for legislation to block a no-deal Brexit, and said they should all be allowed back.\n\n\u201cThe group needs to be considered as a whole to be brought back,\u2019\u2019 she told BBC Radio. \u201cI will wait and see on what terms other people choose to stay out.\u2019\u2019\n\nRudd described the expulsion of the lawmakers as an \u201cact of political vandalism\u201d in her resignation letter and said on Thursday that their vote against the government was no more \u201cegregious\u201d than the repeated votes of hard-line Brexiteers against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit agreement.\n\nWallace: Yellowhammer is a \u2018Living Document\u2019 (8:20 a.m.)\n\nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said the government is working to mitigate the risks exposed in the Yellowhammer planning document released on Wednesday, and will publish an updated version showing progress soon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending the money on doing lots of things to mitigate those assumptions,\u201d Wallace told BBC Radio 4. \u201cWe should consider it as \u2018this is what would happen if we didn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\u2019\n\nDescribing it as a \u201cliving document,\u201d he said there would be further versions. \u201cOur job as a government is to say to people what could happen and then say what we\u2019re doing about it,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nLabour: Yellowhammer Shows \u2018Catastrophe\u2019 for U.K. (Earlier)\n\nAndy McDonald, transport spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said the government\u2019s Yellowhammer planning documents show that a no-deal split from the EU would be \u201ca catastrophe for our country.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is more like emergency planning for a war or a natural disaster,\u2019\u2019 McDonald told BBC Radio 4 on Thursday. Boris Johnson is \u201cdriving the ship onto the rocks,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cand he\u2019ll have a lifeboat but working people will not.\u2019\u2019\n\nPeople on low incomes would be \u201cdisproportionately affected\u2019\u2019 by higher food and fuel prices after a no-deal Brexit, the government warned in the paper.\n\nGrieve: Court Will Tell More on Parliament Suspension (Earlier)\n\nFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who led Parliament\u2019s efforts to force the government to publish its decision-making process behind Boris Johnson\u2018s suspension of Parliament, expects more details to be revealed when the Court of Session in Scotland publishes its full judgment on Friday.\n\nThe court ruled on Wednesday that Johnson had acted unlawfully when he advised the Queen to prorogue Parliament.\n\nNo-Deal Brexit minister Michael Gove refused to release documents relating to the decision on Wednesday evening. Publishing communications between Johnson\u2019s advisers would be \u201cunreasonable and disproportionate,\u2019\u2019 he said in a letter to Grieve.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s reasons for proroguing Parliament have turned out to be entirely bogus,\u2019\u2019 Grieve told BBC Radio 4. \u201cIt\u2019s very serious when a government comes out and deliberately sets out to mislead the public about its motives.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier:\n\nU.K. Warns of Protests, Chaotic Border Scenes in No-Deal BrexitBrexit Is Making English Civil War Comparisons Hard to DismissU.K.\u2019s Leadsom to Meet Businesses to Assess Brexit PreparednessYellowhammer Details Reveal Worst-Case Scenario: Brexit Bulletin", "description": "Boris Johnson Denies Lying to Queen Over Suspension: Brexit Update", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE4D16A_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
