I have a lot to play for. It's not like actually winning this tournament is at the forefront of my mind. I still have to play shots,\" the 36-year-old Colsaerts told reporters.\n\n\"I'm in control of a lot of things, my striking, emotions... it would be amazing to win this thing. But if I stay away from thinking that, my chances will be a lot higher than if I see this thing right in front of me.\"\n\nThe 2012 Ryder Cup winner, who has dropped to 424th in the world rankings, had back-to-back birdies on the fifth and sixth holes and picked up further shots on 11 and 12.\n\nAfter a bogey on the 17th, Colsaerts finished with a birdie.\n\nCoetzee was 10-under overall following a round of 70 to stay in contention despite a disappointing double bogey on the 13th after three straight birdies.\n\nWelshman Jamie Donaldson and American Kurt Kitayama were tied for third at nine-under.", "description": "Golf: Colsaerts leads French Open by three shots", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9I0IX_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
