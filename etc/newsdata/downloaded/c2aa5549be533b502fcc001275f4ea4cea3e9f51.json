He also insulted model and cookbook author Teigen but without mentioning her name.\n\nInstead, the president referred to her only as Legend\u2019s \u201cfilthy mouthed wife.\u201d\n\nTrump tagged Legend and NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, but not Teigen \u2015 and she fired back by taunting him with a new nickname:\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\nThat led to plenty of tweets referring to Trump as \u201cPresident Pussy Ass Bitch.\u201d\n\nThat phrase didn\u2019t trend, likely because of the expletives. But many of his critics began abbreviating it \u2015 and that worked as #PresidentPAB climbed to the top of the list of trending terms:\n\nIt took me a few seconds to figure out what #PresidentPAB meant...and then I smiled. \u2014 Wajahat Ali (@WajahatAli) September 9, 2019\n\n.@ChrissyTeigen\u2019s tweet at Trump was too vulgar for the news to repeat.

It\u2019s going to be painful, lengthy, and you\u2019re going to spectacularly lose. \ud83d\udc2e#filthymouthedwife #PresidentPAB \u2014 Devin Nunes\u2019 cow \ud83d\udc2e (@DevinCow) September 9, 2019\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why #PABOTUS #PPAB and #PresidentPAB are trending, it\u2019s because 45 came for Chrissy and John last night. And they handed him his wig. But Twitter wouldn\u2019t allow #PresidentPussyAssBitch to trend. I will now and forevermore be referring to him as #PABOTUS. https://t.co/SSI6Ix1xIV \u2014 April (@ReignOfApril) September 9, 2019\n\nSeptember 9, 2019: On this day in American history, #PresidentPussyAssBitch trended on Twitter. \u2014 Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) September 9, 2019\n\nComing home from work to see #PresidentPAB is trending has made my damn day.\n\n\n\nDon't ever get in a Twitter war with Chrissy Teigen & John Legend. \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 \u2014 Andrew Goss \u270aUSAF\u270a (@Goss30Goss) September 9, 2019\n\nIf I were to refer to #PresidentPAB would everyone know what that means at this point? \u2014 David Rothkopf (@djrothkopf) September 9, 2019\n\nWondering why Chrissy Teigen, John Legend, #filthymouthedwife, #teamchrissy, #PresidentPAB #PPAB, and #PABOTUS are trending?\n\n\n\nIt's Trump.\n\nOf course.\n\n\n\nEnough about him.
