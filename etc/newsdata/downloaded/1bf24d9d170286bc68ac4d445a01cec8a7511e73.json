That\u2019s what husband-and-wife duo Corey Stoll and Nadia Bowers are doing in the Classic Stage Company production of the Shakespeare tragedy this fall, stepping into the roles of the central couple, only after promising director John Doyle that \u201cwe weren\u2019t going to bring a lot of drama to this.\u201d The two met at an alumni event for NYU\u2019s graduate acting program in 2008, and balance their acting gigs (Stoll recently finished filming Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story; Bowers appeared in the Chekhov-esque Life Sucks) with parenting their almost 4-year-old son. After a day of rehearsals on Macbeth, the two sat down with Vulture over iced coffee to discuss Doyle\u2019s approach to this production, the advantages of acting together as a real-life couple, and what it\u2019s like to have your husband appear in The Romanoffs when you\u2019re an actual descendant of the Romanovs.\n\nDid the offer come in for you two to do this simultaneously?\n\nCS: No, it came to me. I\u2019d worked with John Doyle before; we did Three Sisters a decade ago. John and I were talking about Lady Macbeth, and who would be good, and it seemed clear to me that Nadia would be a great choice. I wanted it to be his choice as much as mine.\n\nNB: [Doyle] didn\u2019t know my work, was the thing. I was also doing a play, Life Sucks, at the time. We had an audition. He\u2019s British, so the way they audition is, they just meet people. We just talked for a while and truly hit it off, and then and I was like, \u201cYou should come see my play.\u201d Then they [gestures at Corey] had a secret meeting that I didn\u2019t know about, where he was like, \u201cSo I want to cast her, but I just want to check with you that that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nCS: He just wanted to make sure that we weren\u2019t going to have pillow talk about it. We weren\u2019t going to bring a lot of drama to this.\n\nYou were both in an episode of The Strain, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve acted together in anything else.\n\nNB: Just some readings, but this was the first time that we\u2019re actually in a rehearsal room together.\n\nDoes that take some getting used to?\n\nNB: It feels very normal. We went to the same acting program, the NYU graduate acting program, and there\u2019s definitely a way of working and a playfulness we have, so maybe that has something to do with it, too.\n\nDo you take the roles home much?\n\nCS: We do some running lines. It\u2019ll be interesting when we go into running it, and the whole scope of the tragedy, taking that in every day. Even though your mind knows that these things aren\u2019t happening, your body is still going through these actions.\n\nNB: It\u2019s a very dark play. It\u2019s like a brutal world that they\u2019re in; John\u2019s really embracing that aspect of it. I feel a heaviness, actually.\n\nHas John talked about the other ideas he wants to explore in Macbeth?\n\nNB: He\u2019s like, \u201cI would like to tell this story to the person who\u2019s never seen Macbeth before.\u201d He has some ideas and some images that are very strong with him.\n\nCS: I think that was partially why he was interested in casting us against each other. We can bring an intimacy \u2014\n\nNB: He said we don\u2019t have to sign an intimacy clause.\n\nCS: Amazing things that you wouldn\u2019t expect can emerge from a real couple working together. If I was coming in and meeting a new actress and trying to establish that we have this relationship, there would be this sense of, like, looking into each other\u2019s eyes, but that\u2019s taken for granted.\n\nNB: What was taken for granted?\n\nCS: But that\u2019s part of a couple! You become a team toward the outside world, and that\u2019s really what these people are.\n\nHow do you approach the dynamic between the Macbeths as a couple?\n\nNB: I have to say some pretty horrible things to you! That\u2019s not so hard. I\u2019m getting to enjoy it more. I think they speak to each other in a way that we don\u2019t.\n\nCS: We\u2019re definitely much more careful with each other\u2019s feelings.\n\nNB: They don\u2019t have a child. That\u2019s part of the problem, I think. Historically, Lady Macbeth was married before and had a child, and in this play there\u2019s only one line that alludes to her perhaps having had a child. Most people are going to think it\u2019s the child between them, but what we\u2019re kind of working with is perhaps there\u2019s a child from a previous marriage who has died. Maybe, since I had children before, I can have children, maybe it\u2019s him. But Male infertility would not be something discussed at that time, so of course everyone would look to her.\n\nCorey, between doing Brutus in Julius Caesar, and Iago in Othello, and even Ulysses in Troilus and Cressida, you\u2019re really working through all the Shakespeare you can.\n\nCS: For me this has been this great education, these last few years, at the audience\u2019s expense [laughs]. Selfishly, I\u2019ve felt I\u2019ve learned so much. This was not a plan. Macbeth wasn\u2019t something that I was dying to do, strangely. I remember reading it, being like, How can the audience possibly have any identification with me? He\u2019s just this murderer. But the language is so beautiful, and it becomes more beautiful and more human as he embraces this bloody path, which is really remarkable.\n\nThe Julius Caesar you were in had a very direct political allegory about Trump, and there are in some ways similar political themes in Macbeth, but I imagine this won\u2019t be that direct.\n\nCS: In terms of any sort of political analogy, we\u2019ve completely steered clear of that. But it\u2019s impossible to hear some of these lines and not feel incredible resonances with what\u2019s happening now.\n\nNB: When I had the audition with John, he said, \u201cDo you have any questions for me?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy are you doing this play right now?\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about evil, and I think we\u2019re at a place where we might be staring evil in the face.\u201d When he was younger, he was part of a political group, and they would say that there\u2019s no evil, there\u2019s just different gradations of good. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that that\u2019s true anymore.\u201d\n\nCS: Evil as a force, not evil as identified in a person.\n\nCorey, when you were in The Romanoffs, one of the anecdotes you told the press was that Nadia is an actual descendant of the Romanovs. Nadia, what was it like to watch him in that show?\n\nNB: You know, it was great. I loved it. I recognized the people he was depicting. I know those people a little bit, you know, especially in the first episode. Marthe Keller\u2019s character was a slightly exaggerated version of some members of my family. But the funny thing was that I heard about this series and I was like, I have to be on this, and 24 hours later the phone rang for Corey. I was like, \u201cThis is the only time in my life I\u2019ve wanted to kill you!\u201d You know what? Like, maybe I could get you killed because I\u2019m a Romanov, so.\n\nCS: I can attest to that. Being in a couple as both actors, the assumption from the outside is that there\u2019s this incredible amount of competitiveness, and that\u2019s actually very rare.\n\nNB: But that time it was allowed, and you understood it.\n\nCS: It\u2019s your birthright!\n\nDo you consult each other on your careers?\n\nNB: Yes, and we also have an almost 4-year-old, so there\u2019s more consideration now because of this child.\n\nCS: Yeah, it\u2019s become more complicated.\n\nNB: This is the first time we\u2019re ever on the same schedule. Usually there\u2019s some kind of unevenness.\n\nCS: Once we\u2019re in performances and we\u2019re exhausted, we can\u2019t say, \u201cI was performing last night, you wake up and, you know, take him to school!\u201d\n\nNB: Yeah, that is the one thing. We\u2019ll have to alternate or something.\n\nI guess if your kid is 4, you\u2019re not quite at the point where you have to explain, \u201cMommy and daddy are going to go pretend to kill people onstage.\u201d\n\nNB: I don\u2019t think so. Although my son said to me the other day, \u201cMommy, I have my opening tonight so that means I\u2019m not gonna see you for a while.\u201d He was totally matter-of-fact about it! But I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll bring him to the theater. I brought him to Life Sucks and he sat down in the front row and he was like, \u201cMommy, do some acting.\u201d I don\u2019t think he totally understands what it is, but he knows what rehearsal is and audition, he knows those words.\n\nAre there other theatrical couples you two would like to play together?\n\nNB: Someone said Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, someday. That would be fun.\n\nCS: That one I feel like it would be hard not to bring stuff home.\n\nNB: They don\u2019t kill!\n\nCS: No, but they kill each other.
