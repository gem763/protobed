Versions of the video reached more than 15,000 accounts on the messaging platform Telegram within half an hour, according to an analysis by Megan Squire , a computer science professor at Elon University in North Carolina.\n\nMs. Squire, who studies online extremism, said she monitored dozens of \u201cvery severely racist, violent channels\u201d that promote white supremacy. On several channels, users debated whether the gunman should be made into a saint, according to screenshots she shared.\n\n\u201cTelegram exists as a forwarding network \u2014 that\u2019s the main way the information flows,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very efficient mechanism for them.\u201d\n\nThe Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism , a nonprofit organization formed in 2017 by Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube, said in a statement that it was \u201cactively removing perpetrator-created content related to the attack\u201d in an attempt \u201cto prevent its viral spread across our services.\u201d Amazon is also a member of the forum.\n\nThe footage that appeared on Twitch was posted from an account created two months ago.\n\nThe assailant identified himself in accented English as \u201cAnon\u201d before denying the Holocaust, complaining about feminism and immigration and saying that \u201cthe root of all these problems is the Jew.\u201d\n\nHe then drove to a synagogue on Halle\u2019s Humboldt Street, an arsenal of weapons visible in his car. He struggled to enter the synagogue. After a woman spoke to him as she passed in the street, he shot her in the back, and then shot her several more times after she collapsed.\n\nUnable to enter the synagogue even after shooting at the door, he drove to a kebab shop. He fired at two men cowering behind a beverage machine and then went outside, where he fired at several pedestrians. Later, he re-entered the shop and shot the body of one victim several times.", "description": "The live-streaming platform, owned by Amazon, has struggled to police content as it is posted.", "authors": ["Tiffany Hsu"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/business/09TWITCH-01/merlin_162441444_fe0e1132-bf7e-4416-a536-bbac7c3b33d7-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
