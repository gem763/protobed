General Assembly this month in New York. Whether such a meeting materializes, however, remains in question, though Iranian comments Wednesday seemed to suggest Tehran would be willing to pin hostilities on the departing Bolton rather than Trump himself.\n\nRouhani spoke after a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, a day that saw all major newspapers in Iran cover Bolton\u2019s departure. The pro-reform Shargh daily newspaper had one large headline that read: \u201cBolton: A scapegoat for Iran?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans have to realize that warmongering and warmongers are not to their benefit,\u201d the Iranian president said in televised remarks. \u201cThey should not only abandon warmongering but also abandon their maximum pressure policy.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS John Bolton listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Aug. 20, 2019, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nAli Rabiei, a government spokesman, said after the meeting that Bolton\u2019s dismissal may help the U.S. have a \u201cless biased\u201d attitude toward Iran.\n\nThough he stressed the dismissal was an internal U.S. issue, Rabiei called Bolton \u201cthe symbol of America\u2019s hawkish policies and its animosity toward Iran.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Zarif again used Twitter to write about what he calls the #B_Team, which included Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, all hawks on Iran.\n\nZarif said \u201cthe world \u2014 minus 3 or 2 panicked cohorts \u2014 was breathing a sigh of relief\u201d after Bolton\u2019s ouster. \u201cThirst for war \u2014 maximum pressure \u2014 should go with the warmonger-in-chief,\u201d Zarif wrote.\n\nHard-liners, however, urged caution.\n\nGen. Mohsen Rezaee, a commander in the powerful Revolutionary Guard and its former chief, said in a tweet: \u201cWe will not be deceived by the sacrificing of Bolton.\u201d\n\nBolton was critical of any potential talks between Trump and leaders of Iran and had persuaded Trump to keep U.S. forces in Syria to counter the Iranian influence in the region.\n\nLast year, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal that lifted sanction on Iran in exchange for caps on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The U.S. administration later also intensified sanctions on Iran, slashing its sales of crude oil abroad and sending the country\u2019s economy into freefall.\n\nIn response, Iran has in recent months crept past the limits the nuclear deal imposed on uranium enrichment and its uranium stockpile. And over the weekend, Tehran announced it would use advanced centrifuges prohibited under the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, mysterious attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, the downing of a U.S. military surveillance drone by Iran and other incidents across the wider Middle East have exacerbated the crisis in the region as Tehran tries to pressure Europe to find a way to sell crude oil abroad despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nRouhani has called the use of faster centrifuges Iran\u2019s \u201cthird step\u201d away from the nuclear deal. On Wednesday, he said that \u201cif necessary, we will take other steps in future.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Bolton was a longtime hard-liner on Iran who favored regime change and took money for speaking engagements from an Iranian exile group reviled by Tehran called the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, or MEK. Bolton famously wrote in 2015, before Iran\u2019s nuclear deal was struck, an op-ed in The New York Times headlined: \u201cTo Stop Iran\u2019s Bomb, Bomb Iran.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran,\u201d Bolton told a cheering crowd of MEK supporters in March 2018. \u201cThe behaviors and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore, the only solution is to change the regime itself. And that\u2019s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\u201d\n\nBolton would become Trump\u2019s third national security adviser a month later.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t back away from any of it. Those are positions I took as a private citizen,\u201d Bolton said when journalists asked him during a visit to Abu Dhabi in May about his prior remarks to the MEK. \u201cRight now I\u2019m a government official. I advise the president. I\u2019m the national security adviser, not the national security decision-maker. It\u2019s up to him (Trump) to make those decisions.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision Tuesday was to fire Bolton. What happens next remains unclear.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.", "description": "\u201cAmericans have to realize that warmongering and warmongers are not to their benefit,\u201d the Iranian president said in televised remarks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d78dfd7240000122777cc0f.jpeg?cache=iva0owulae&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
