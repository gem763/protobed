There is no need to talk. The sole focus is to shoot. And shoot again. And again. Once the ball leaves Cowan\u2019s hands, his right wrist flicks and his feet tap back to earth, it just repeats. He creates one copy after the next every few seconds.\n\nRhythmic booms echo off the walls, the sound of the ball thudding against the hardwood or occasionally bouncing off the rim. That\u2019s the soundtrack that persists through this night and so many others, joined only by murmurs of spoken numbers from graduate assistant Brenton Petty, who keeps track of how many shots Cowan has made from each spot.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Petty interviewed for the job at Maryland, director of operations Mark Bialkoski mentioned how Petty would be the guy always on call for the mundane but critical task of rebounding and passing balls back to players who want extra shooting practice \u2014 whether that\u2019s at 1 a.m. or 7 a.m.\n\n\u201cI was cool with it because I love being in the gym,\u201d said Petty, a Washington native who played college basketball at Fordham. \u201cI\u2019m a grinder. I just love basketball, so if the guys want to get better, I\u2019m there. I can\u2019t say no to that.\u201d\n\nThe previous night, Petty posted an Instagram story, time-stamped 10:33 p.m., featuring sophomore Jalen Smith, who had just finished his extra workout. As Petty began to leave Xfinity Center, Cowan called via FaceTime. Cowan saw the post and knew Petty was still at the gym with Smith, so he figured he would come over and shoot, too. Instead of heading home, Petty readied to help another player late that evening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnce official practice began in October, such late-night and early-morning sessions tapered off and will become less frequent as soon as games begin and the players need to stay fresh. But during the offseason, Petty joined a handful of players, usually in 30-minute intervals, just about every morning and evening for the additional work.\n\n\u201cIt's a culture you want,\u201d Coach Mark Turgeon said. \u201cAnd I think it's a culture you need to have a chance to win. Because if you don't have it, you have no chance.\u201d\n\nWith the start starting next week, accompanied by high but welcomed expectations for the Terps, this offseason work has been an oft-mentioned point of discussion. Many of the team\u2019s core players will be sophomores, such as Smith. They are expected to take the leap that usually comes with a player\u2019s second year in a program. Those strides begin to take shape in the months when games aren\u2019t played.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen there\u2019s that crushing NCAA tournament loss to LSU on a late layup that ended Maryland\u2019s season and snatched away the chance to play a round-of-16 game in the District. Most players quickly cite that defeat as fuel for much of their work this offseason.\n\nAaron Wiggins, a sophomore poised for a breakout season, sometimes found himself in the gym four times a day this summer. (\u201cI know it sounds insane,\u201d he said, before explaining why it\u2019s sensible in his eyes.) Wiggins is close friends with Petty, so he would enlist rebounding help at night with a quick text message that said, \u201cGym?\u201d Petty would reply with a time that worked. Wiggins would shoot. Then they would agree on a time for the next morning.\n\nHere\u2019s Wiggins\u2019s rationale: \u201cI want to get better. I need to get better. I can sleep at night.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe mentality trickles down to the newcomers learning how to approach college basketball, just as these players learned about work habits from Bruno Fernando, who Petty said was a frequent inhabitant of the Xfinity Center gyms.\n\nTurgeon never knows the exact schedule of who is practicing on their own, how often and when, \u201cbut I have a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it. I\u2019ll hear about it. I sense it. I can see it in the way they\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\nGraduate assistants, and the managers who also help with the extra work, can\u2019t instruct players on the court. They can only rebound and pass, but those are the two elements necessary for efficiency. A couple of weeks into the school year, Petty worked out a schedule that assigned a pair of managers to each day of the week. In a group text, he provides the daily schedule of what times certain players want to shoot. Players usually take off Saturdays, the day Petty frequently visits his girlfriend, who works in New York. The managers rotate in shifts, but Petty attends every session.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s choreographed chaos. If a ball bounces out of reach, the manager quickly chases it down so the player\u2019s flow never halts. When Petty and manager Michael Belay helped Cowan that Thursday night, the senior point guard\u2019s work lasted just 21 minutes. He took about 350 shots and made 265. That\u2019s about 17 shots per minute, or one every 3.6 seconds.\n\n\u201cI think muscle memory is everything,\u201d said Cowan, who avoids mornings, at least for the voluntary work. \u201cI think this year, I\u2019m just doing whatever I think I have to do to win something.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the extra practice, Cowan is an \u201ceveryday-type guy,\u201d Petty said before they started shooting. So even though Cowan began the following day with a 6:30 a.m. lift, chances are he stayed late again that night, too, with each shot inching him closer to the time of year when a three-pointer on the same court is followed by a deafening roar.\n\nRead more from Post Sports:\n\nAD", "description": "Graduate assistant Brenton Petty has the keys to Xfinity Center.", "authors": ["Emily Giambalvo", "Reporter Covering University Of Maryland Athletics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oYWEsNwrQK6AhTfvjLyjLCFczl4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RSQJRMXQHAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
