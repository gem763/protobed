People living here are doomed. This village will be a ghost town in a few years\" Goran Stoyak Tuzla local community spokesman\n\nThat\u2019s where our reporter Val\u00e9rie Gauriat met Goran Stojak, who recently lost his father to lung cancer.\n\nIn the last four months, six people from Divkovici have died of the same condition.\n\nThey are the latest on a long list of deaths from lung cancer in the area.\n\nThe finger of suspicion points towards the Tuzla power plant. Waste from its coal combustion is discharged just outside the village.\n\nBosnia faces legal action over Chinese-backed coal dash: https://t.co/1VNw1dXjG7pic.twitter.com/nwtX90KiTH \u2014 Climate Home (@ClimateHome) October 31, 2016\n\nGoran Stojak has been fighting to save locals from the plant\u2019s pollution for years.\n\n\u201cThe power plant is there, and the waste comes through the pipeline,\u201d Stojak explained to Euronews.\n\n\u201cAnd this water gradually seeps into the ground, it spreads on the banks, on both sides of the lake. And it gets into the wells from where people get their drinking water.\u201d\n\nOnce filtered and mixed with water, the waste is piped to large landfills on the village outskirts.\n\nTests carried out by an independent laboratory have shown high concentrations of heavy metal residues lying deep underground.\n\n\u201cIt looks like fairly rich, fertile soil. But it\u2019s actually waste residues from the coal plant.\u201d commented Valerie Gauriat, taking some of the brown ashes Goran had scraped from the surface in her hand. \u201cAnd in there, you can find things such as cadmium, mercury, arsenic , chromium. All this has contaminated the land around the village, as well as the water.\u201d\n\nIn dry weather, the wind blows particles of toxic soot to peoples\u2019 homes.\n\nMost villagers are affected by asthma, bronchitis and even more serious lung diseases.\n\n\u201cLast night, I had to take my wife and our seven-month-old baby to hospital for lung obstruction problems,\u201d Stojak said.\n\n\u201cLying in bed at night I often hear my neighbour crying out from the pain of lung cancer, he continued. \u201cPeople living here are doomed. This village will be a ghost town in a few years. There\u2019ll be nobody left.\u201d\n\nGoran heads up a neighbourhood community and constantly tries to get local authorities to do something about the plant\u2019s pollution.\n\nHe says nothing has been done for the 70 people who still live in the village, such as Mila, who lives off a meager pension, and until recently, from food grown in her garden.\n\n\u201cThey used to weigh up to three kilos,\u201d she told Euronews,, showing a finger-size beet grown in her garden for the cows.\n\nLaboratory test results scare Mila, but she says it is not easy to give up on her home-grown produce.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have small pensions, we have to live off something.. We have no money to buy things outside. My son is unemployed. I have to grow what we eat. \u201c\n\nEuronews reporter Valerie Gauriat said It was impossible to get into the Tuzla power plant. Repeated requests to the electricity company managing the plant \u201cgot lost in the chimney fumes,\u201d she said.\n\nCoal \u2013 the most harmful fossil fuel\n\nHeavy metals, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and fine particles, make coal the most harmful of fossil fuels.\n\nAlong with air pollution from cars and domestic coal burning, the plant puts Tuzla high on the list of Europe\u2019s most polluted cities.\n\nThe Centre for Ecology and Energy has complained about the Tuzla power plant\u2019s expansion projects. Its director Dzemila Agic says it\u2019s better to invest in energy efficiency.\n\n\u201cWe found out that by implementing simple measures, we can reduce the consumption of thermal energy by 42 percent and carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent. Things like thermally insulating buildings,\u201d Agic told Euronews.\n\nPlans for more coal sites\n\nThere are four coal plants in Bosnia and Herzegovina and plans to build a further seven coal sites.\n\nNGOs say that could generate an 18 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions) \u2013 from the level seen in 1990 \u2013 by 2030.\n\nIn the absence of a national energy programme, building new coal facilities at the moment doesn\u2019t depend on the State\u2019s decision, but on the country\u2019s entities own individual plans: The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska.\n\nVal\u00e9rie Gauriat spoke with Admir Softic, vice-minister for energy at the foreign trade ministry in Sarajevo.\n\n\u201cWould you agree that in order to comply with reduction of emissions commitments, all these plans would have to be cancelled?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cThis is a political issue that the governments of both entities which make up Bosnia and Herzegovina will handle,\u201d says Softic\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the state is determined to meet its commitments towards the Energy Community and the European Union. We are determined to achieve the target of 40 percent for renewable energy by 2020,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Republika Srpska, the Ugljevik coal power plant also plans a new unit.\n\nManagement opened the plant\u2019s door to Euronews; but did not comment on the expansion project, which has also attracted complaints from environmental organisations.\n\nWhat they did want to speak about, was its plans to modernise the existing plant over the next three years.\n\n\u201cOnce we have completed the construction of a desulfurization unit, we will reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 80 times, at 200 mg per cubic meter, which represents the most rigorous European standards,\u201d the plant\u2019s project manager Zlatko Malovic told Euronews. \u201cOn the other hand, we will also reduce by 8 times the emissions of particulate matter from the chimney by installing new electro filters.\u201d\n\nNobody here disputed the health and environmental impact of the plant; but workers insist it\u2019s a crucial source of employment for the whole region.\n\nRadivoje Radic has worked at the Ugljevik power plant for 20 years. He told Euronews that until clean energy is developed, locals can not do without the coal industry to find jobs.\n\n\u201cDespite the health risks, we are forced to produce electricity in this way,\u201d Radic said. \u201cOtherwise our youth would leave for other cities, other states, other continents in order to find jobs.\n\n\u201cAnd if there were no more young people living here, then what would be the point in keeping this plant open?\u201d\n\nLive updates from our Insiders team", "description": "On all Saints day, people had come from all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and even from abroad, to honour their loved ones at the cemetary of the Divkovici village, in Bosian and\u2026", "authors": ["Val\u00e9rie Gauriat", "Goran Stoyak"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/349197/1000x563_349197.jpg", "published_at": "2016-11-11"}
