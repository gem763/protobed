Mueller III\u2019s investigation, arguing that despite legal rulings during the impeachment inquiry into President Richard M. Nixon, in hindsight courts in 1974 should not have given Congress materials from the Watergate grand jury.\n\n\u201cWow, okay,\u201d Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of Washington responded, sounding unpersuaded. \u201cAs I said, the department is taking extraordinary positions in this case.\u201d\n\nHowell called the stance one of several \u201cextreme\u201d arguments presented by Trump administration lawyers in opposing the House request for Mueller grand-jury materials, part of a widening impeachment investigation of President Trump.\n\n[Read the Watergate grand-jury letter to President Richard M. Nixon]\n\nOver a two-hour hearing, Howell voiced strong skepticism of Justice Department arguments against granting the House petition, presented in a lawsuit that predated Congress\u2019s current impeachment inquiry surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nHowell, a 2010 appointee of President Barack Obama, pressed veteran Justice Department civil division litigator Elizabeth J. Shapiro on whether the department now viewed as \u201cwrongly decided\u201d a landmark ruling by then-Chief U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica that transferred a sealed report and grand-jury evidence to House investigators, who prepared Nixon\u2019s articles of impeachment.\n\nThe grand-jury materials, colloquially known as the \u201cSirica road map,\u201d gave Congress evidence in the legal case against Nixon for the burglary \u2014 and subsequent coverup \u2014 of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex. Nixon resigned as the 37th president before he was formally impeached.\n\n\u201cIf that same case were heard today, a different result would obtain,\u201d Shapiro said, saying Sirica relied on an \u201cambiguous\u201d interpretation of law that no longer is valid.\n\n[House panel asks court to enforce Mueller-related subpoenas, a step toward possible impeachment]\n\nThe courtroom debate Tuesday turned on a 1974 federal appeals court decision in Haldeman v. Sirica that upheld that congressional impeachment proceedings are excepted from normal grand-jury secrecy rules.\n\nThe decision found that a House impeachment investigation and Senate trial qualify under an exemption that permits prosecutors to share information \u201cpreliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d\n\nIn the request before Howell, the Judiciary Committee and House General Counsel Douglas N. Letter are asking her to order the release to Congress of redacted portions of Mueller\u2019s 448-page final report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, grand-jury materials cited by the report and grand-jury witness statements subject to the \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d exception.\n\nIn court Tuesday, the Justice Department argued that in a decision this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit tightened grand-jury secrecy requirements in a way that would exclude impeachment inquiries.\n\nThe circuit, in April in McKeever v. Barr, struck down one factor relied on by Sirica, finding that contrary to his 1974 ruling, judges have no \u201cinherent authority\u201d to release such grand-jury materials when the public interest outweighs the need for secrecy. However, the circuit court in a footnote agreed with Sirica that congressional impeachment still qualifies as a \u201cjudicial proceeding.\u201d\n\nHowell did not say how or when she would rule but ordered Justice Department attorneys to explain by Friday why prosecutors are not sharing the information under another exception that allows prosecutors to give federal or foreign officials information about \u201cgrave hostile acts of a foreign power\u201d or \u201cclandestine intelligence gathering.\u201d Howell also ordered the department to disclose how many \u2014 and which \u2014 FBI witness interview reports that it pledged to give the committee have been turned over so far and how many it plans to turn over, as well as the legal basis for withholding FBI interview reports of witnesses who never went before the grand jury.\n\nIn an evening filing, the Justice Department said it had provided the committee access to FBI reports for 17 of 33 individuals it requested, although those of senior Trump advisers Uttam Dhillon and Rob Porter were mostly redacted to protect conversations with the president. The department said it expects to make the remaining individuals\u2019 reports available \u201cso long as they do not adversely impact ongoing investigations and cases\u201d and are redacted \u201cto protect Executive Branch confidentiality interests.\u201d\n\nThe remaining individuals include former White House counsel Donald McGahn and two of his deputies, John Eisenberg and Annie Donaldson; former top Trump advisers Stephen K. Bannon, Hope Hicks and Reince Priebus; and senior Justice Department officials Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham and Dana Boente, a former acting attorney general and now FBI counsel.\n\nThe House lawsuit preceded Congress\u2019s impeachment inquiry. It started about two weeks ago, after disclosure of Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian government officials to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 campaign rival, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden.\n\nThat inquiry focuses on an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s complaint that Trump abused the powers of his office and that the White House allegedly tried to cover up the matter, including the withholding of hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. military aid from Ukraine.\n\nLetter, in court, said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), in announcing the official impeachment inquiry, did not limit it to Ukraine but included an \u201cumbrella\u201d of pending investigations by six House committees.\n\nRead more:\n\nAppeals court in D.C. rules judges may not create exceptions to grand-jury secrecy rules\n\nWatergate report released from archives could be a \u2018road map\u2019 for Mueller\n\nThe foreman of the Watergate grand jury was among those watching confrontations with another president\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Trump administration lawyers argued that under current precedent, courts should not have sent the Watergate grand-jury report to Congress.", "authors": ["Spencer S.
