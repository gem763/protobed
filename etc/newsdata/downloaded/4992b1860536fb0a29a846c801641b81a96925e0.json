The Cruel Intentions star put the round of treatment to bed back in July in an effort to suppress her immune system\u2019s reaction to multiple sclerosis attacks. By the looks of it, Blair is doing much better. In fact, she seems downright cheeky!\n\nOn Saturday, she posted a photo of herself posing in front of a mirror. Blair, who is bald from the chemo, is wearing a super preppy and polished pink and Kelly-green blazer in the picture \u2014 and nothing else. Well, actually, she is holding a crab-shaped purse, which is strategically placed to cover her private parts in the front. But the view of her bare derriere makes it clear that Blair went pantless for the \u201cportrait of a lady,\u201d as she captioned the shot.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Blair\u2019s famous friends to begin filling her comment feed with positivity. Rocker Gavin Rossdale dropped three black heart emojis. Michelle Pfeiffer gushed, \u201cPerfection!\u201d Demi Moore let loose a string of emojis including hearts, applause hands, a flame and lips. Christina Milian weighed in, \u201cAdore you!\u201d And Blair\u2019s longtime celeb BFF Sarah Michelle Gellar joked of the crab purse placement, \u201cYou know they have medicine for that.\u201d\n\nBlair\u2019s unapologetic display of her baldness (on both ends!) resonated with some fans who themselves are struggling with MS or who are bald due to other health issues. One, who suffers from an autoimmune disorder, summed it up nicely, saying, \u201cThank you for showing me that bald is beautiful. But more than just the outward appearance, you show me how to be fierce!\u201d\n\nThe photo did find a few critics. However, Blair seemed to handle them with grace, humor and refreshing honesty. When one commenter said they didn\u2019t understand why she posted the picture and told Blair to hold on to her \u201cdignity,\u201d the actress explained why she shared the portrait. \u201cI think it\u2019s a vulnerable, humorous, odd and interesting fashion shot,\u201d she replied. \u201cI like it.\u201d\n\nKeep doing you, lady.\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.
