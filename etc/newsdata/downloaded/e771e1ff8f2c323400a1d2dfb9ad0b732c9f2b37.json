The Democratic National Committee (DNC) said it was sharply raising the qualification requirements for the third debate in Houston next month to thin out the crowd.\n\nBut for a miracle, the 10 who will appear at Houston\u2019s Texas Southern University on September 12 will be Joe Biden, who is polling at 37 per cent according to a DNC average cited by Politico, Bernie Sanders (21), Elizabeth Warren (20), Kamala Harris (17), Pete Buttigieg (7), Cory Booker (3), Amy Klobuchar (3), Andrew Yang (3), Juli\u00e1n Castro (3) and Beto O\u2019Rourke (3). On Wednesday, Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York senator, announced she was dropping out of the race after failing to qualify for Texas.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

A number of candidates, including Montana governor Steve Bullock and Hawaiian congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, criticised those regulations. On Monday, Ms Gabbard termed them \u201ccockamamie criteria\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Ms Gabbard, a military veteran who has spoken out about the US\u2019s involvement in foreign wars, had reached 3 per cent in several polls, but they were not those recognised by the DNC.\n\nOn Wednesday, two new polls she and Mr Steyer had been relying on to push them over the line ahead of Wednesday\u2019s midnight deadline, did not show any surge in support for any of the trailing candidates. Neither Ms Gabbard nor Mr Steyer crossed the 2 per cent threshold in the polls released by Quinnipiac University and USA Today/Suffolk University.\n\nMs Gillibrand had also been hoping for better news in the new polls; it did not appear. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t the result that we wanted. We wanted to win this race,\u201d she said in an online video. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to know when it\u2019s not your time.\u201d\n\nIn the Quinnipiac poll, Mr Biden, the former vice president, was in the lead on 32, with Ms Warren on 19 points and Mr Sanders on 15.\n\nThe single night format could have a dramatic impact on the race. Mr Biden, the frontrunner, has generally been reckoned to have had two bad debates and was strongly attacked in the first by Ms Harris, raising questions about his ability to think on his feet, and about the wisdom of his running at the age of 76.\n\nThe third debate will now see him confronted not just by Ms Harris, but also by Ms Warren, who is widely believed to have been among the strongest performers in the first events and has debating skills that combine emotional power with a forensic grip on policy details.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point when Democrats want to, and must, narrow the field. Debates help to do that,\u201d said Larry Sabato, professor of politics at the University of Virginia. \u201cAt the debate itself, it\u2019s always possibly a candidate or two may commit a gaffe so egregious that they are eliminated. I call it the suicide watch. It is rare but occurs from time to time.\u201d\n\nJeanne Zaino, professor of political science at New York\u2019s Iona College, told The Independent, candidates may increasingly feel the need to do something to stand out as the field narrows. She also said it was unclear how long the apparent non-attack agreement Ms Warren and Mr Sanders appeared to have agreed to would hold as the contest went forward.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re down to one debate, I think it will help voters put the presidential candidates in some sort of order,\u201d she said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "description": "Democrats are set to slash the number of candidates taking part in their next, vital debate \u2013 a move that could have dramatic consequences for the race to take on Donald Trump in 2020.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/27/03/pri71773576.jpg"}
