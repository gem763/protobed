Now you can, with Pix, the \u201cfirst smart animative backpack,\u201d which is currently funding on Kickstarter. The backpack can display pictures, animations, and playable 8-bit games like Tetris and Snake, all synced through an iOS and Android app.\n\nEarly-bird backers can get the backpack for $199, which seems a little on the expensive side. But how important is a customizable illuminated screen to you? You can\u2019t put a price on individuality, okay? What if you\u2019re a kid getting ready for the first day of middle school? Or you need to be easily spottable in a sea of people at a rave? Plus, just look at all the other useful ways it can be used!\n\nYou can use it to wait for your friend Ann at the airport:\n\nHail a cab when your friend Ann lies to you about coming to see you for winter break. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s really not ready for a relationship right now:\n\nUse it to hitchhike to Oslo when taxi drivers see your weird backpack and refuse to pick you up:\n\nAnd finally, use it to give up and meditate at the airport while you accept your fate that no one is going to pick you up, and this is your life now:\n\nAll jokes aside, it does seem pretty useful for cyclists. A cycling remote (which is offered in the $299 cyclers pack) attaches to your bike and can sync with the backpack through Bluetooth to display turn signals and stop signs. It can also display other widgets like time, weather, and mobile notifications.\n\nThe Kickstarter campaign for the Pix smart animative backpack just launched today, and as of now, it\u2019s on a healthy trajectory to reach its $35,000 goal. As with all Kickstarters, use your best judgment when backing projects.", "description": "The PIX smart animative backpack can display your pixel designs, play games, and display widgets.", "authors": ["Dami Lee", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QL9Ej1yO5dwF8mf1bnFNFEcADsY=/0x16:803x436/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12458671/Screen_Shot_2018_08_22_at_2.14.42_PM.png", "published_at": "2018-08-22"}
