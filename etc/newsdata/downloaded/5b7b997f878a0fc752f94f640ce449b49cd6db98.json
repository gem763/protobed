And it's up to us now.\n\n'I feel like we've got everything in front of us that we need to achieve and sometimes you can have a wake-up call, which can be the best thing for you.\n\n'In football a wake-up call can be huge for the whole squad and everybody looking forward to the games.'\n\nMcTominay and Scotland are set to return to action against San Marino on Sunday\n\nScotland suffered their fourth defeat in succession as they were beaten 4-0 by Russia\n\nMcTominay stressed the importance of treating San Marino with respect in order to avoid an upset against the team who sit bottom of the FIFA World Rankings and are currently on a 34-match losing streak.\n\nHe added: 'Every football match you want to win, first and foremost. Whether that's San Marino or whether that's Belgium or Russia or Kazakhstan, it makes no difference to us.\n\n'Every game of football we want to go and do our best and give a good account of yourself as well.\n\n'You have to treat every team with respect because if you don't you can be shocked because that's football and anything can happen.\n\n'Obviously we're working now - today and the couple of days before - to put things right. We've got to get back to that positive stage where we're looking forward to the games coming up in March as well.'\n\nMcTominay stressed the importance of treating San Marino with respect to avoid an upset\n\nClarke's current squad contains a host of players, like McTominay, who ply their trades at the highest level in England and Scotland.\n\nAnd the 22-year-old believes it is key that they replicate their club form for the national team.\n\nHe added: 'You've got different players who are playing in the Premier League, the Championship, the Scottish Championship and the Scottish Premiership and it's important for us to bring our club form into the national team as well.\n\n'And that's one thing that the manager has asked, it's important that you have to bring your own stamp on the game as well.'", "description": "Scott McTominay spoke of the positive effect a wake-up call can have on Scotland as they look to bounce back from four straight European Championship qualifying defeats.", "authors": ["Euan Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/23/19637648-0-image-a-22_1570917623366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
