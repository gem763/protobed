Now the cyclists cannot mount their bikes without a sugary gel, bottles of Gatorade and whatever else the sports-food/-drink industry is pushing, which is definitely not raw meat.\n\nThe Tufts University epidemiological study is just more unscientific, food-questionnaire rubbish, the purpose of which is to prop up food-industry investments and dogma. These investments basically involve anything coming from government-subsidized grain.\n\nTufts is still on the low-fat/high-carbohydrate train, which is purported to be good in some sense. The implication is that saturated fat causes artery damage and thus heart disease. It won\u2019t make it into the headlines or the American Medical Association, but at this point the military is so desperate with a 67 percent overweight and obesity rate that it is actually paying for randomized, controlled trials to figure out what to do. It should be noted that U.S. Army food is dictated by the USDA food guidelines, which is the low-fat approach to nutrition.\n\nRecently, the Army funded a study at Ohio State involving ROTC students which were randomized into two arms; one high-fat (ketogenic) and the other high-carbohydrate, or exactly what Tufts recommends. Compliance was measured by blood tests, done at least daily. As it turns out, the saturated fat in the cells of the keto group were a quarter of that in the high-carb group.\n\nWhat happened? The keto study arm metabolized the saturated fat, and the high-carb group did not. It ended up building up in the students\u2019 tissues, and thus in their blood streams. That saturated fat came from the carbohydrates via the liver, and that is exactly what Tufts is pushing. Unless the Army or the Defense Department gets serious and junks the Tufts/USDA recommendations, they will continue to get fatter and sicker.\n\nSAMUEL BURKEEN\n\nReston, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
