The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index dropped to 47.8 in September from 49.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.71% was most recently fell 205 points, or 0.8%, lower to reach 26,771, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.58% declined 0.6% at 2,958, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.38% fell 0.4% to 7,966. The slowdown in manufacturing reflects a retrenchment in the U.S. and global economies exacerbated by a trade war with China. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 50.2.
