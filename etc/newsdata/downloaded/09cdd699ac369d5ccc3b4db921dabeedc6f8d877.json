As the Supreme Court showed us a few weeks ago, he is not. No one is above the law, even a British Prime Minister.\"\n\nShe also confirmed that the letter requesting an extension to Article 50 \u201chas been drafted and attached to the Act to the European Union asking for more time.\"\n\nThe Labour peer added that it was important to see what a Boris Johnson deal might look like, and that Parliament must be able to scrutinise his proposals.\n\nShe said his current proposals \"cannot get through\".\n\nHowever, that if a deal was approved by Dublin and Brussels, it would be something that would be \"more likely\" to pass Labour's tests.\n\nQuestioned on the prospect of a caretaker Prime Minister, in the event of Mr Johnson resigning or being removed from the post, she dismissed current speculation that Commons Speaker John Bercow could take on the role.\n\n\u201cIf I may say so, we are now getting into almost fantasy football.
