US to beef up military defenses in Saudi Arabia, UAE Move follows drone and missile attacks attributed to Iran or its proxies in the region.\n\nThe U.S. military is dispatching an undetermined number of additional forces to Saudi Arabia to beef up its air and missile defenses after blaming Iran for recent drone and missile attacks on Saudi oil facilities, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon Friday.\n\n\"To prevent further escalation Saudi Arabia requested international support to help protect the kingdom's critical infrastructure,\" Esper said. \"The United Arab Emirates has also requested assistance. In response to the kingdom's request, the president has approved the deployment of U.S. forces, which will be defensive in nature, and primarily focused on air and missile defense.\n\n\"We will also work to accelerate the delivery of military equipment to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to enhance their ability to defend themselves,\" he added.\n\nThe announcement followed an hourslong meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump in which Pentagon leaders outlined a series of options to respond to renewed aggression from Iran and its proxies in the region.\n\nMarine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters the number of American personnel needed is still being determined but said it would be a \"moderate deployment,\" and likely \"not thousands\" of troops.\n\n\"This is the first step we are taking in response to these attacks,\" Esper said.", "description": "Move follows drone and missile attacks attributed to Iran or its proxies in the region.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey", "Caitlin Oprysko", "Nahal Toosi"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170757292-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
