Other potential symptoms include depression, fatigue, blood clots and appetite loss, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nPancreatic cancer, which is projected to kill about 45,750 Americans this year, is the third deadliest cancer in the U.S. The overall five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 9%, according to 2008 to 2014 National Cancer Institute data cited by the American Cancer Society. For Stage 4 patients, the relative survival rate is 3%. Pancreatic cancer is hard to detect early, since its symptoms often don\u2019t emerge in early stages.\n\nTrebek disclosed his diagnosis in March, announcing two months later that he was in remission. But the game-show stalwart went on to face setbacks in his cancer treatment, and suggested to CTV in a recent interview that the physical toll from his chemotherapy might eventually prevent him from hosting \u201cJeopardy.\u201d\n\nAlso see: I was diagnosed with Stage 3 pancreatic cancer in April \u2014 should I tell my family how I intend to distribute my estate?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of dying. I\u2019ve lived a good life, a full life, and I\u2019m nearing the end of that life,\u201d Trebek said. He added: \u201cIf it happens, why should I be afraid [of] that? One thing they\u2019re not going to say at my funeral, as a part of a eulogy, is \u2018He was taken from us too soon.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe costs of pancreatic-cancer treatment \u201care high and increasing,\u201d according to one 2012 study published in the journal Cancer. Researchers analyzed a data set of more than 15,000 pancreatic cancer patients aged 66 and older who received their diagnoses between 2000 and 2007, finding that total direct medical costs totaled more than $65,500 per patient on average, with a marginal cost increase over time.\n\nPancreatic cancer\u2019s economic burden is \u201csubstantial,\u201d the study\u2019s authors added, despite patients\u2019 \u201cpoor prognosis and short survival.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur estimate of the total direct medical cost of care for pancreatic cancer patients ranks at the lower end of the range of cost estimates reported for other cancers in the Medicare population,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHowever, survival for other cancers, such as breast, prostate, colorectal, bladder, and even lung, is typically much longer. Considering their limited life expectancy, pancreatic cancer patients incur substantial costs in a very short time period.\u201d\n\nTrebek, for his part, encouraged people to participate next month by wearing purple, spreading the word on social media and visiting WorldPancreaticCancerDay.org.\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you join me in this fight?\u201d he said. \u201cTogether, we can get it done.\u201d", "description": "The overall five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is 9%.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU341_trebek_ZG_20191030131502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
