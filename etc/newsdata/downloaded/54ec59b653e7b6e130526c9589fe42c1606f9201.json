Federal prosecutors, who usually handle cases involving suspected terrorism or cases dealing with national security, have now taken over the investigation.\n\nIt is unknown how many people were inside the synagogue at the time of the incident, but the head of Halle's Jewish community, Max Privorotzki, told Der Spiegel that he estimated there were about 70 to 80 people inside.\n\nPHOTO: A police officer speaks with a Jewish man near the site of a shooting, in which two people were killed, in Halle, Germany, Oct. 9, 2019.

We first received information that there is one suspect, who was armed. There have since also been suggestions that there potentially there have been more people involved, but that at this point is not confirmed. We currently know of at least one suspect.\"\n\n\"The suspect then fled in a car. The police were able to trace a vehicle, which has been secured outside of Halle. The police arrested one suspect,\" he added.\n\nPHOTO: Policemen climb over a wall close to the site of a shooting in Halle an der Saale, eastern Germany, on Oct. 9, 2019.

My wife came running to me screaming, 'Someone is shooting outside!'\" Splett told ABC News. \"I ran to the window looked outside and saw a man wearing a steel helmet. His face was all red, either painted or maybe he has a skin disease. He was very calmly shooting with a double-barreled gun arbitrarily at a group of people. Those people at first weren't realizing what was going on at first. They then all ran away.\"\n\nPHOTO: Policemen walk through a street close to the site of a shooting in Halle an der Saale, eastern Germany, on October 9, 2019.

He had a whole arsenal of guns in his trunk. A woman in the kebab place under my flat screamed. After about half an hour lots of police came in terrifying gear. They said we can't leave our house and if we do, we can't come back inside,\" he said.\n\nThe German government's secretary of state, Heiko Maas, drew a link between the shooting and anti-Semitism in the country.\n\n\"The fact that on the reconciliation festival #YomKippur shots were being fired at a synagogue hits us right in the heart,\" he posted on Twitter in German. \"We all have to fight against anti-Semitism in our country.
