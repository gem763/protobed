'She's my baby, I just wanted to know she was okay.\n\n'I had texted her earlier in the night saying 'come home' and she said she would be home soon - I keep thinking if she would have come home this wouldn't have happened.\n\n'We had to lay her on her front going to the hospital because she could not lay on her back - I could smell her legs burning the whole way. When the doctor saw Emily he could smell the burning too.'\n\nMs Godfrey said that Emily had been at the park, a place she goes to regularly with friends, but they decided to leave after noticing a gang at the other side of the field with fireworks.\n\nThe teenager was left with burns and cuts (right) and had to have bandages after the firework hit her nerve endings\n\nThe yobs threw a firework as she was approaching the gate to exit the park.\n\nIt hit the teenager, despite her friend trying to push her out of its path.\n\nHer distraught mother said: 'She has been left with burns to both legs and one on her bum too. She is bruised from the impact.\n\n'She was wearing a black designer coat, and if the firework had hit her any further up her whole coat would have gone up in flames.\n\n'Doctors told us Emily's burns are superficial and have hit nerve endings so she's been given strong painkillers.\n\n'The shock must have kicked in around 11pm last night as near enough on the hour, every hour, she was throwing up.'\n\nShe said that Emily, who is struggling to walk due to her injuries, is due back in hospital today when doctors will be able to assess her recovery time.", "description": "GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Emily Godfrey (pictured) was left 'screaming in agony' after\u00a0a gang launched the missile at her in Merseyside.", "authors": ["Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20275212-0-image-a-48_1572259551690.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
