Today we were excellent, with fast flowing football. That\u2019s Manchester United. We\u2019re trying to get back to that,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cMarcus has that strike in him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him in training so many times.\u201d\n\nLampard said Rashford\u2019s free kick had been a bolt from the blue.\n\nHe felt the game was theirs for the taking after Batshuayi, scorer of the winner at Ajax last week, ran from the halfway line before holding off a tackle and coolly dispatching a low shot into the bottom corner.\n\n\u201cNo team can stop that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t at our best in the first half, we were a little slow with our passing, but I loved the first half hour of the second half.\u201d\n\nChelsea have lost three games at Stamford Bridge in all competitions this season, one more than they did in the whole of the 2018-19 campaign. But Lampard was not too downhearted.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\n\u201cI saw a lot of things that were good for us for the future, a lot of positives,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate losing, we all do here, but it\u2019s clear there is a big picture and there are a lot of big games for us to come and a busy fixture list.\n\n\u201cNow we move on and focus on what is to come.\u201d\n\nThe draw for the quarter-finals is on Thursday in which United will be joined by Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Leicester City, Everton, Colchester United and Oxford.", "description": "Marcus Rashford's \"bolt from the blue\" stopped resurgent Chelsea in their tracks as his sensational free kick fired Manchester United into the League Cup quarter-finals with a 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446697512&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T201", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
