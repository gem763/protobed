The runway looks included everything from bonafide floral bouquets on heads at Marni and Prabal Gurung, to temporary facial modifications (again!) at Balenciaga, to barely-there makeup at Stella McCartney. And, again this season, many designers opted to customize the beauty direction to fit each model and outfit, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach to hair and makeup.\n\nHere are six of the new season's top hair and makeup trends.\n\nSide hustle\n\nGood news: The easiest hair trend of the season is one that you can recreate quite easily at home.\n\nAt shows including Loewe, Prada, and Michael Kors, the go-to hair look involved a deep side part finished with sleek, smooth tresses. The quick, versatile technique adds edge to tight ponytails, loose waves and slicked-back hairstyles.\n\nDark side\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, intensely dark blue and black lip makeup reigned supreme for spring, at Courr\u00e8ges, Marques'Almeida, Max Mara and other runway presentations. The bold pouts \u2014 shown in both matte and shiny finishes \u2014 created an interesting contrast to the bright and pastel colours that dominated many collections. At the Molly Goddard show during London Fashion Week, artist Hiromi Ueda even emphasized models' cupid's bows using black liquid lipstick.\n\nRainbow dash\n\nRemember last season's painterly eyes? Multi-coloured, painted lids were popular again for Spring/Summer 2020. Techniques ranged from high-contrast shapes at Chromat to more sheer, blended colours at Christian Siriano.\n\nThe rainbow-hued eye look at Salvatore Ferragamo, created by artist Fara Homidi, was inspired by Murano glass and finished using MAC's high-shine Lipglass product.\n\nWet 'n' wild\n\nYou may want to retire your hair dryer for spring: The wet-hair look is back, big time. For the Christopher Kane show, hairstylist Guido Palau created low ponytails with a glossy look with gelled hair. Other shows that featured wet-looking hair this season \u2014 which can be tied up or left in loose waves \u2014 include Prabal Gurung, Prada and Versace.\n\nPearl jam\n\nPearls have become a popular, modern fashion trend in recent years, and this season was no exception. Faux pearls were used to embellish the headbands at Simone Rocha, on the sculptural ear cuffs at Prabal Gurung, and to create an otherworldly facial effect at the wonderful Dries Van Noten show, designed this season in collaboration with iconic couturier Christian Lacroix. The French manicures at the Alice + Olivia show were also finished with pearl tips.\n\nPlaits please\n\nAt Max Mara, hairstylist Sam McKnight created simple, centre-part double braids on some models for the military meets Killing Eve-inspired wardrobe, while at Canadian designer Erdem's show, the bow-finished plaits were created by hairstylist Anthony Turner.\n\nWhether your hair is shoulder-length or much longer, the key this season is to have a tight centre part so that the effect is more graphic and less romantic.\n\nTruc Nguyen is a Toronto-based writer, editor and stylist.
