Marra ruled that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Miami under Alexander Acosta\u2014who later became President Trump\u2019s labor secretary\u2014broke the law in 2007 when it devised Epstein\u2019s secret sweetheart deal without notifying victims. The ruling was seen as a huge victory for Jane Does 1 and 2, who sued the government in 2008, alleging the deal violated the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act by keeping them in the dark on the negotiations with Epstein.\n\nBut in his ruling on Monday, Marra rejected most of the victims\u2019 requests for remedies, including their demand that the government turn over FBI records related to the Epstein investigation and strike the immunity provision for Epstein\u2019s alleged co-conspirators.\n\nFour women were singled out for immunity in the 2007 plea deal\u2014in addition to other potential unnamed accomplices\u2014after victims identified them as recruiters who allegedly helped procure underage girls for the financier\u2019s pleasure. The women were identified in the document as \u201cincluding but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Melendez", "Thedailybeast.Com Jeffrey-Epstein-Judge-Refuses-To-Scrap-Plea-Deal-That-Protected-Co-Conspirators Source Articles Via Rss"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
