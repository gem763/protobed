It Didn\u2019t Work", "language": "en", "text": "A thoughtful, moving letter (slightly edited by me for privacy) from a reader, responding to my post about the new Pew numbers on the collapse of Christianity in America:\n\nI\u2019ve just read your Christianity Collapsing in America post. I\u2019d like to speak to your frustration or desperation at the end about the importance of working out a response. People for whom their Christian faith is a very, very big thing\u2014the biggest thing of anything in their lives\u2014are and have been working to defend and pass it on to their children for several decades now, but I think you underestimate how high the number of the \u201cfallen\u201d (using a battlefield metaphor more than a wages of sin metaphor) is likely to be even with intensive Ben-Oplike action.\n\nThis is not to counsel giving up but to emphasize how much more insidious and seductive the West\u2019s soft atheism/agnosticism/scientism/religious mush is. I think it may be worse for the faith than Communism was in Eastern Europe and Russia, because, though the stakes then compared to now (this likely will change some at least) were much higher for Christians in such societies, the seduction factor was less. Also, many people who didn\u2019t have the heroism to remain practicing Catholics or Orthodox or whatever were not convinced into atheism or agnosticism but internally tilted with greater or less slant to the side of the angels.\n\nI sound defeatist, and in part it is because, personally, as a parent of now-grown children, I have been defeated. That is, my two sons are agnostic at best; my two daughters are vaguely spiritual/Christian without, as far as I can tell, doctrinal content, except that God is chill with whatever makes us happy. Nobody goes to church or identifies particularly with any faith. In college, my youngest briefly attended a sort of cool, interdenominnational church called either Liquid or Fluid\u2014I could never remember which, which she found annoying.\n\nI was very consciously contending with the culture while I brought them up. I was quite aware that we needed community to support us, and for 8 years I belonged to a terrific home-schooling group of interesting, faithful, intelligent Catholics having lots of kids and loving and enjoying them while remaining quite firm about what they believed and how they and their children were to live. We talked about the Faith, tried to live the Faith, provided counter-arguments to what was wrong. We celebrated holidays and events together, even had intramural sports together.\n\nNow, I know that a couple of important factors specific to our situation influenced my kids to defect. My husband, though Catholic and technically conservative doctrinally as well as politically (I am not sure even now, however, to what extent he really believes in the truth of God and all that), [had some severe personal problems]. Eventually (when the oldest kids were high school age) things got really bad, we separated, and the kids went to (Catholic) schools since I was working full-time to support everybody. So I can see those fault lines quite clearly. But, not to normalize our experience, there are A LOT of broken marriages, abusive marriages, and alcoholic marriages even among the fervently religious, so there are many people reading BEN OP stuff or in the category that should who also live with the kinds of major dysfunction that don\u2019t make handing on their religion easier.\n\nBut additionally, as I said, the softness of the current atheistic/agnostic/pantheistic/fill-in-the-blanks Western society is extremely hard to push or pull against. As you know, everything the surrounding culture produces proselytizes with greater or lesser subtlety for secular materialism, scientism, whatever you want to call it. As the children grow older, realistically speaking, being a traditional, orthodox Christian in this polarized climate begins to drastically reduce your friend pool, your potential romantic partner pool, your potential employer pool, your odds of getting stellar recommendations from professors, etc. I don\u2019t say that the kids do a cost-benefit analysis\u2014I am sure though that the idea of writing off most of their peer group and many of their potential mentors is unappealing.\n\nAnd that is when \u201cideas\u201d and thinking even come into it! The biggest barrier to keeping the next-generation believers, I think, is the seeming monopoly on tolerance that the surrounding liberal secular world persuades people it has. You still have younger children, and from what I can tell there has been no slippage yet, but once someone\u2019s children have slipped into questioning-the-faith-of-their-fathers mode (not in the way all people do at some point to make a faith their own, but in the way someone beginning to break off from family to sidle over to the culture does), then it is almost impossible (at least, I found it so) to make arguments for the faith that aren\u2019t immediately dismissed because we \u201cwon\u2019t just let gay people be happy too\u201d or we\u2019re ignoring the latest research on transgender people. And don\u2019t even start on contraception, or the indissolubility of marriage, arguments about not living together beforehand, etc.\n\nThe sexual issues, and particularly the newer same sex marriage/transgender ones, are like an enormous dike walling them off from Christian belief. It is not that there aren\u2019t arguments and there isn\u2019t a vision of life that makes sense of Christianity, as you know, but that they are impervious to these\u2014they won\u2019t listen to these, they discount all of it in their heads as a holdover from past prejudices and tribalism. They are similarly largely impervious to history, or to classic literature, which becomes a storehouse of outmoded, superseded beliefs. And they believe so firmly that science explains everything they need explained. And this includes social science. I know that whenever I say something along traditional lines they are with greater or lesser patience or hostility thinking, \u201cYou have nothing to say to me: You come from a place that history and society have rightly and thankfully journeyed beyond.\u201d\n\nI know it is not impossible for strong Christians to emerge in this culture\u2014I have seen some of them in my children\u2019s generation and under. But there aren\u2019t many, and even in the non-dysfunctional smart, strategic, and heroically faithful families, even in those who surround themselves with supportive families and friends for their children, there is no guarantee that all or even most of the children will enter adulthood faithful.\n\nI say this not to dissuade or dishearten you, but to ask you to be more aware of how much people can be doing and trying even when the desired result does not occur. Just don\u2019t conclude that they didn\u2019t, so to speak, do Ben Op right\u2014don\u2019t be like those test pilots in Tom Wolfe\u2019s The Right Stuff who, when someone crashed a test plane, were driven to coming up with a theory about why, if the pilot had only done this or that, the crash would not have occurred. Sometimes, in some cases, if nothing has worked, it is possible that nothing would work.\n\nOh, and one observation I had about the PEW figures and tables you showed\u2014though you correctly mentioned that the largest drop occurred in the Northeast, the percentage drop in the South was quite close to it and was I think much more significant, since in the Northeast religious belief and influence have been tanking for some time, but the South is where everyone counts on seeing Christian affiliations.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rod Dreher"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-17-at-5.42.55-PM-e1571352200498.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
