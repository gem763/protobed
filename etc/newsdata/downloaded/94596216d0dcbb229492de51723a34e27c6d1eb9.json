It centers around a shocking whistleblower complaint filed by an anonymous intelligence community official.\n\nThe whistleblower said that in a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump used \"the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election.\"\n\nThe complaint detailed concerns how Trump used the call with Zelensky to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son days after withholding a nearly $400 million military-aid package.\n\nBiden's son, Hunter, served on the board of Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings from 2014 to 2019. Trump and his allies have falsely accused Biden of using his power as vice president to urge Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma in order to protect Hunter.\n\nA memo summarizing the call released by the White House confirmed the substance of the whistleblower's complaint. It showed that after telling Zelensky that \"we do a lot\" for Ukraine in terms of military support, Trump asked him for \"a favor\" by investigating Hunter Biden's business dealings and helping to discredit the Russia probe.\n\nAsking a foreign government for material campaign aid is not only unprecedented from a president, but it could even violate campaign finance laws against soliciting aid from foreign nationals. Cipollone is now in charge of crafting the White House's defense against damning allegations that Trump abused his office for personal gain.\n\nThe \"Department of War\"\n\nWhile Cipollone is more reserved and has stayed out of the public spotlight, he's been forcefully staking his claim on being the White House's point person leading the impeachment defense in a sometimes-chaotic White House without a clear impeachment strategy or leadership structure.\n\nA graduate of the University of Chicago law school, Cipollone clerked for a federal judge, did a stint in the Department of Justice, and worked in private practice for the white-collar firm Kirkland Ellis and at the firm Stein, Mitchell, Cipollone, Beato & Missner.\n\nCipollone, a devout Roman Catholic who has 10 children with his wife Rebecca, also has a background as a religious activist, and has been involved in Catholic caucuses like the National Prayer Breakfast and the anti-abortion March for Life. One of his daughters works as a booking producer for the prominent Fox News host Laura Ingraham.\n\nAn in-depth profile of Cipollone recently published in The New York Times reported that in his career as a lawyer, Cipollone is known for approaching cases with a more combative approach, which he dubs \"the Department of War,\" rather than a diplomatic strategy.\n\nCipollone took a hardball approach in his letter to House Democrats, writing, \"you have conducted your proceedings in secret. You have violated civil liberties and the separation of powers by threatening Executive Branch officials, claiming that you will seek to punish those who exercise fundamental constitutional rights and prerogatives.\"\n\nRead more: The floodgates are opening as Trump officials publicly defy his orders and more whistleblowers come out of the shadows\n\nWhile Cipollone's strongly-worded letter certainly made a splash, several legal scholars criticized it for both flatly refusing to cooperate with the House's inquiry and falsely suggesting that impeachment \u2014 a process outlined in the constitution \u2014 is itself unconstitutional.\n\nAccording to a separate recent report in The Times, Cipollone has also put his foot down in the White House, and quickly shut down a proposed plan to hire former GOP congressman Trey Gowdy \u2013 who led the House's Benghazi's hearings under the Obama administration \u2014 as their main lawyer running point on the impeachment inquiry and \"the face\" of their impeachment defense.\n\nThe plot to hire Gowdy ultimately fell apart due to lobbying regulations that would have prevented him from formally joining the administration until January.\n\nThe Times reported that Cipollone has been clashing in particular with Trump's right-hand-man acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, \"with one disagreement about hiring an additional lawyer taking place in front of Mr. Trump.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nProsecutors are scouring Rudy Giuliani's bank records and business dealings in Ukraine as part of a widening criminal investigation\n\nFBI officials were 'rattled' and 'blindsided' by Trump's call for Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Joe Biden\n\nThese are the key players you need to know to make sense of the Trump impeachment inquiry", "description": "Cipollone is known for his mild-mannered demeanor and low profile, but he's taking a hardball approach to the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da612c04af909075f5b2b24?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
