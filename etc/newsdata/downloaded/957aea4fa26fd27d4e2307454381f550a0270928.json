The rate of decline in prices has slowed in recent months and that can foreshadow a reversal from down to up. Let's check further.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of GME, below, we can see the brutal decline in price from around $17 back in January and last September to near $3 last month. GME has been below the declining 50-day moving average line for much of the past 12 months and GME is testing the underside of that line now.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line had been in a decline until the middle of August where it starts to show some improvement. As noted above, the 12-day price momentum study in the lower panel shows higher lows from June to July to August, telling us that the pace of the decline has slowed. This is a bullish divergence compared to the price action.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of GME, below, we can see a three-year decline from around $28. The 40-week moving average line has been bearish the entire time.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows an uptick in August and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is crossing to the upside for a cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of GME, below, we can see an upside price target above $5.\n\nBottom line strategy: If you are holding any of the approximately 58 million shares short GME I think it is time to cover.", "description": "Let's check further....GME", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "This Party Is Over", "Gamestop Shorts Need To Cover", "Let'S Check Further.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Helene Meisler", "Eric Jhonsa"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/784682ad-8086-11e8-b47c-2fa7b9478b78.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
