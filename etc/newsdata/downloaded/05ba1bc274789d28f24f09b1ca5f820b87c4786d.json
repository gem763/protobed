To celebrate, God himself apparently opened the gates of hell (which you would know if you watched last season\u2019s finale) and, you guessed it, released everyone, including every single demon, ghost, and murderer captured during the series\u2019 previous adventures. \u201cYou and me versus every soul in hell? I like those odds,\u201d says Dean. See, this is why these guys were so good at their job. The Earth is going to be a real mess after they retire. The final season of Supernatural premieres on Thursday, October 10.\n\nRelated", "description": "Sam and Dean Winchester find the ghost of serial killer John Wayne Gacy, as well as all their previous foes, in the trailer for Supernatural\u2019s 15th and final season.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/13-Supernatural-Final-Season-Trailer.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
