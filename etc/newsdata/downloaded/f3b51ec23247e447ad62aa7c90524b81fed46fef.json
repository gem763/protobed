Who are they? What is their intention?\" Hasina said in a speech to her political party's members.\n\n\"I asked our countrymen to have patience. And those who want to fish in troubled waters, we will find them and take action against them.\"\n\nBhola's deputy police chief Sheikh Sabbir told AFP that the man came to the police station on Saturday, claiming his Facebook account was hacked.\n\n\"We also suspect that his account was hacked and these contents were spread through Facebook messenger,\" he said. However, the charges have not been dropped.\n\nIn 2016, angry Muslims attacked Hindu temples in an eastern town over a Facebook post that allegedly mocked one of Islam's holiest sites.\n\nIn 2012, Muslim mobs torched Buddhist monasteries, houses and shops in the coastal Cox's Bazar district following a Buddhist youth's alleged defamatory photo post of the Quran.\n\nBangladesh has also experienced a number of attacks on people from religious minorities, secular bloggers, publishers, writers and foreigners, many claimed by far-right groups.", "description": "At least 4 killed after police fire at thousands of protesters calling for action against blasphemous post.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/20/6e88bc78c85446f9bc26815923557b80_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
