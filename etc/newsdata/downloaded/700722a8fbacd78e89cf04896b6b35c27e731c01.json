Voters have only failed to re-elect an incumbent candidate to a second term on four occasions in the country\u2019s history, but recent polls show Trudeau\u2019s approval hovering around record lows, making him vulnerable against the former youngest-ever Speaker of the House of Commons:\n\nCanadian Electoral Landscape\n\nWith both candidates polling just above 30%, the winner will likely have to form a coalition with smaller parties in addition to working with a fragmented Parliament, but it\u2019s still worth exploring what their economic policies may mean for the and the Canadian economy more broadly. Starting with the obvious: the Canadian economy has performed relatively well under Trudeau\u2019s tenure, with near record lows, inflation subdued, and the stock market hitting a record high last month, though GDP growth has moderated to below 2% this year.\n\nBeyond voters\u2019 evaluation of the candidates\u2019 personalities, the biggest policy-related issue will be around the environment.

Meanwhile, a bounce from this support level, perhaps on the back of a Trudeau victory, could extend into the 1.3200-1.3300 area before encountering meaningful resistance.\n\nWith the major candidates polling neck-and-neck on the eve of the election, and a minority government likely in either case, is poised for elevated volatility in the coming week!", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Matthew Weller covering: USD/CAD.
