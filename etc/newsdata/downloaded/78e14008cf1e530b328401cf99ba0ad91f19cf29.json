(Tom Fox/Dallas Morning News/AP/AP)\n\nAs she walked to her apartment on the night of Sept. 6, 2018, Amber Guyger missed a series of signs that she wasn\u2019t on the right floor, prosecutors say.\n\nThe off-duty Dallas police officer didn\u2019t realize that the illuminated unit numbers contained fours instead of the threes of a floor below, where she lived. She didn\u2019t recognize the doormats were all different. And, in the final seconds before she turned the doorknob to apartment 1478 and opened fire on the man who lived there, 26-year-old Botham Jean, she didn\u2019t notice the doormat he\u2019d placed outside. It was red \u2014 his favorite color.\n\nDuring opening statements Monday in Guyger\u2019s murder trial, prosecutors offered a reason: She was distracted by the sexually explicit conversation she had been having with her partner on the police force, Martin Rivera.\n\nThey had been in an intimate relationship for the past year, prosecutors say, and spent hours swapping messages about being \u201csuper horny\u201d and wanting to meet later that night. After a 16-minute phone call with Rivera, Guyger was so consumed that she didn\u2019t process the \u201crepeatedly obvious signs\u201d that something wasn\u2019t right, Assistant Dallas County District Attorney Jason Hermus told jurors.\n\n\u201cAll of these things that she\u2019s aware of, she just doesn\u2019t let them get here,\u201d he said, gesturing toward his head. \u201cAnd that failure cost Bo his life.\u201d\n\n[Ex-Dallas officer to stand trial for shooting neighbor in his own apartment]\n\nThe killing of the Saint Lucia-born accountant and church worship leader \u2014 who was among 992 people fatally shot by police officers in 2018, according to a Washington Post database \u2014 came amid national scrutiny of police use of force, especially against people of color. That a white police officer had shot a black man in his own apartment stoked outrage and drew protesters to Dallas.\n\nGuyger, who told a 911 operator she thought Jean was burglarizing her apartment, was arrested on a manslaughter charge days after the fatal encounter and fired from the police department, where she had worked for five years. A grand jury later indicted the now-31-year-old on a murder charge. Defense attorney Robert Rogers attributed that decision to \u201call the political pressure and the emotion that seemed to be injected into the process,\u201d telling the Dallas Morning News that the killing was \u201ca tragic mistake.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Rogers made the same case to jurors. He dismissed Hermus\u2019s claims that Guyger was planning a rendezvous with Rivera on the night of the shooting, saying the pair hadn\u2019t been intimate in months. The explicit text messages cited by prosecutors are merely \u201ca distraction,\u201d he said. Guyger went to the went to the wrong apartment not because of her flirtation with Rivera, but because she was \u201con autopilot.\u201d\n\nHe described the South Side Flats apartment building as confusing and noted that at least 90 residents had reported accidentally parking on the wrong floor. Guyger, worn out from her 13-hour day working on the crime-reduction team, didn\u2019t notice the doormats or the other clues she was headed the wrong way, her lawyer argued.\n\n\u201cWhat was going through Amber\u2019s mind was just, \u2018I\u2019m going home,\u2019 \u201d Rogers said. \u201c \u2018I\u2019m done with my day of work, I\u2019m exhausted and I\u2019m going home.\u2019 \u201d\n\n[Ex-Dallas officer to stand trial for shooting neighbor in his own apartment]\n\nWhen Guyger opened the door to apartment 1478, Jean was sitting on the couch in a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, watching TV and working on a bowl of vanilla ice cream \u2014 \u201cdoing no harm to anybody, which was his way,\u201d Hermus said. But Rogers argued the officer believed she had walked in on an intruder. He said she didn\u2019t recognize the variation between her apartment and his \u2014 the cluttered counter top, the different furniture \u2014 because she was experiencing tunnel vision.\n\nThe prosecutor said that in firing two shots at Jean, Guyger strayed from her police training, which teaches officers confronting a burglar to take cover, contain the intruder and call for backup. The defense attorney said Guyger feared he might kill her. It was only after one of the bullets had gone through Jean\u2019s chest that she realized \u201cwhat a horrible, horrible mistake\u201d she had made, her attorney said.\n\nShe called 911 and told the operator, \u201cI shot a guy thinking it was my apartment.\u201d Rogers said Guyger knew Jean was beyond her ability to help, and thought that summoning emergency medical services was the best way of helping him. But Hermus contended that she \u201cshould have made it her point of existence to take care of that man.\u201d\n\nInstead, she texted Rivera again.\n\n\u201cI need you, hurry,\u201d she wrote.\n\nA minute later, she sent him another message: \u201cI f----- up.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA Texas teen football player collapsed and died in his twin brother\u2019s arms\n\nAn Iowa hog farmer said his wife fell on a corn rake.
