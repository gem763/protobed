He will land that job now and join Graham Thorpe as one of Silverwood\u2019s assistants, with both expected to be given more responsibility in a coaching team who have a very familiar look to the one led by Trevor Bayliss.\n\nSilverwood will also look to appoint a full-time bowling coach, a position left vacant after his own promotion, but this is unlikely to happen until after the New Zealand tour next month, with an interim to be used for that trip, possibly from within the county game.\n\nSilverwood was yesterday named as the replacement for Bayliss, becoming only the second Englishman to coach the Test team in almost 20 years, a period that included two stints by Peter Moores.\n\nHe was chosen ahead of the far more experienced Gary Kirsten, who boasted a glittering CV after working with the best players in the world and guiding India and South Africa to the top of the Test rankings. He also led South Africa to a Test series win in Australia, the ultimate target for Silverwood, and won the 2011 World Cup with India.", "description": "One of Chris Silverwood\u2019s first steps as England head coach will be to appoint Paul Collingwood as a full-time member of a backroom team with a strong English identity.", "authors": ["Nick Hoult", "Cricket News Correspondent", "Michael Vaughan", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/07/TELEMMGLPICT000209187997-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjJeHvIwLm2xPr27m7LF8mVHgqYUgJ_JhTzwMJn4tS-c.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
