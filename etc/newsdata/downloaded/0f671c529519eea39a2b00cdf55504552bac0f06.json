But it\u2019s likely to further undermine efforts by Europeans and Trump himself to find a diplomatic opening with Tehran.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBrian Hook, the U.S. special envoy for Iran, unveiled the reward program at the State Department. The announcement comes as Tehran has pledged to take more steps this week to reduce its commitment to the Iran nuclear deal, which is barely hanging on after the U.S. pulled out of the deal last year.\n\nThe reward program\u2019s goal is to get more information about the financial mechanisms of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which Trump has designated a terrorist group.\n\nHook insisted that despite greenlighting such punitive moves, Trump still wants to negotiate a diplomatic solution to the standoff with Tehran. Trump \u201cbelieves very much in bilateral diplomacy,\u201d Hook said.\n\nThere is widespread speculation that Trump will try to get a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during the United Nations General Assembly later this month. But Iranian officials have rebuffed such overtures from Trump in the past.\n\n\"Anything is possible,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

The sanctions target an Iranian petroleum shipping network directed by the Quds Force, a special unit of the Guard.\n\nEarlier this week, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Iran\u2019s space program, saying the efforts are simply advancing Iran\u2019s ballistic-missile activity.\n\n\u201cThere will be more sanctions coming,\u201d Hook said Wednesday.\n\nIranian officials, meanwhile, have said they will further reduce their commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal by the end of this week, despite efforts by European leaders to keep the deal intact. Under the deal, the country scaled back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nAfter pulling out of the nuclear deal, Trump reimposed those sanctions on Iran and then piled on numerous additional sanctions, badly hurting the Iranian economy.\n\nIn retaliation, Iranian officials have taken a few steps to back away from the 2015 deal and appear more inclined to pull out of the deal altogether.\n\nFrench officials this week have been talking to Iranian and U.S. officials about coming up with a way to give Iran a line of credit worth billions of dollars to entice Tehran to fully adhere to the agreement and pave the way for more diplomacy.\n\nBut that line of credit would require some easing of U.S. sanctions. And Hook sounded dismissive of the idea in general, saying the U.S. has no plans to tamp down its \u201cmaximum pressure campaign\u201d on Iran.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no concrete proposal that has been generated,\u201d he added about the credit line idea. \u201cWe have to see a change in Iranian behavior, which we still haven\u2019t seen yet.\u201d", "description": "The goal is to get more information about the financing for Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist group.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a0/61/362b560e4139ae7a1906d3764f9c/190722-iran-flag-ap-773.jpg"}
