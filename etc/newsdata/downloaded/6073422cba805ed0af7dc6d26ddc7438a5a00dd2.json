Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), adding that Democrats should insist on providing zero new money for the wall, even as the White House has found ways to circumvent Congress to secure billions for the wall by shifting funds away from military construction projects.\n\nBut a funding fight over border security also risks exposing divides within the Democratic party \u2014 reigniting an emotional debate that nearly tore the caucus apart earlier this summer. And those tensions could complicate Democrats\u2019 efforts to complete their packed fall agenda.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
