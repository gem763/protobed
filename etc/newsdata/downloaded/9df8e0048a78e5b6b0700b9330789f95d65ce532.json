Apple's $160 AirPods, for example, don't offer any features for blocking out or reducing noise from your surroundings and aren't sweat-resistant. They also don't come with tips in varying sizes to accommodate different preferences.\n\nThat all changes with the AirPods Pro, the company's newest wireless headphones that launch in stores on Wednesday and cost $250. The upgraded AirPods now support noise cancellation, using outward and inward-facing microphones to cancel out sound before you hear it. There's also an option to switch to transparency mode, which lets you hear sound from the world around you along with whatever content you may be listening to through the AirPods. And they're now sweat resistant, so you should be able to wear them during a workout or in light rainy conditions without worrying.\n\nWith the AirPods Pro, Apple is closing the gap between its popular earbuds and the competition, especially as the space continues to get even more crowded with newcomers like Amazon and Microsoft. By launching a pair of high-end headphones alongside its regular AirPods, Apple is also following a strategy its pursued with other products in recent years, like the iPhone and iPad.\n\nOverall, Apple's new AirPods offer meaningful improvements over the regular version that will make a bigger difference for most people than the jump between Apple's first- and second-generation AirPods. I'd have to spend more time using them before I can make a judgment call, but this feels like the upgrade that owners who purchased AirPods back in 2016 have been waiting for.\n\nHere's a brief look at my first impressions after spending just a couple of hours with the AirPods Pro.", "description": "Apple's new AirPods Pro offer noise cancellation, sweat resistance, and other enhancements that may make it worth upgrading from the regular buds.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db8acb2dee01968de5da194?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
