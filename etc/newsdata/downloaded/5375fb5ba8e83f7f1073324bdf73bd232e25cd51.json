Although it was Africa that was mentioned in the documentary (by Harry) as a potential future home for them, reports that the couple may be planning to take six weeks off work (a \u201cwell-earned break,\u201d as palace sources describe it) and spend much of it near Meghan\u2019s mom in Los Angeles have rekindled suggestions that ultimately the Sussexes might be heading west.\n\nMeghan never gave up her passport, and therefore could easily apply for dual citizenship for Archie, smoothing the transition.\n\nAnd their recent move to engage an American PR company, Sunshine Sachs, has been interpreted as the laying of foundations to construct an American power base.\n\nFor Prince Charles, the departure of Harry and Meghan threatens a serious disruption of his vision for the future of the royal family.\n\nHaving spent much of the past decade ruthlessly cutting back dead wood, having long thought that a bloated royal family living off the public purse represented a mortal threat to the continued existence of the Monarchy, Charles might now regret the haste with which he pensioned off Her Majesty\u2019s grandchildren, Eugenie and Beatrice.\n\nThey were horrified when they were first informed by Charles\u2019 office that they would henceforth have no public role or funding and that their police protection was also to be withdrawn.\n\nHowever, after the initial shock, both have adjusted well to life in the outside world. They both got jobs while continuing with their charity work, Eugenie married last year and Beatrice is now engaged. When the Daily Mail runs stories about how many vacations they have been on, they can shrug them off, arguing that they are now private citizens entitled to do whatever they want with their time.\n\nIt seems unlikely they would want to go back to more public roles, but Harry and Meghan\u2019s one-hour film has blown Charles\u2019 succession plans sky high.\n\nMeghan and Harry\u2019s friend, the journalist Tom Bradby, appeared to question whether or not Harry and Meghan would ultimately carry on being full time royals in the closing seconds of the film.\n\nHe would not have made these comments without the consent of his most valuable contacts.\n\nOne can\u2019t help wondering, therefore, whether Harry and Meghan intended the remark to be a veiled threat to William and Charles; start treating us nice, or we will walk away, causing unimaginable instability at the very heart of your beloved institution.\n\nOf course, the Sussexes may genuinely feel they will have little choice but to put clear blue water between themselves and the Monarchy.\n\nHarry confirmed that relations are not good between him and William now; so how will that play out when William becomes king in, say 20 years (if Charles lives to 90)?\n\nWilliam has many qualities, but forbearance is not one of them.\n\nHarry may be able to get away with undercutting and overshadowing his big brother at the moment, with the queen, weakened by age and her astonishing indulgence, unable to stop him.\n\nThe writer Lady Colin Campbell, a friend of Princess Diana, her biographer and the author of a new book, People of Color And the Royals, says: \u201cWhen the two boys were very young the queen was concerned that their mother allowed them too much freedom and did not discipline them to the extent that she thought they should be disciplined.\n\n\u201cWilliam she was able to take under her influence, as an apprentice, and this has had a very positive influence on him. He understands and accepts and performs true to the constraints required of a responsible monarch in waiting. Harry on the other hand has not had the benefit of this nurturing. Such nurturing as he had was from a mother who used to tell him, \u2018Do whatever you want and as long as you don\u2019t get caught it\u2019s fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe queen may not be up for a fight with Harry, but the idea that William would tolerate a documentary like this without reprisals if he was actually king beggars belief.\n\n\u201c His financial firepower makes his threat to walk away entirely credible, and it will be fascinating to see if they use the six week vacation to play at being a non-royal couple \u201d\n\nThe comparison with Prince Andrew is interesting. Andrew has felt for a long time that being part of the British royal family has negatively impacted his life, but his relative penury has left him with few options. He has to toe the line to continue receiving the handouts that sustain his lifestyle.\n\nHarry is in a very different situation. He is independently wealthy; thanks to Diana\u2019s financial legacy he is estimated to have private investments and wealth totaling well over \u00a330m.\n\nBut, what\u2019s he really getting out of being a royal at this stage? Mental health problems and abuse.\n\nHis financial firepower makes his threat to walk away entirely credible, and it will be fascinating to see if they use the six week vacation to play at being a non-royal couple.\n\nHarry and Meghan\u2019s office have not responded to requests for an official comment on their rumored break, but the suspicion is growing that this may be more than just a holiday.\n\nIt could be a trial run for a more permanent arrangement.", "description": "The Royal Family's advisers are \u201cafraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple,\u201d according to a source close to Meghan and Harry.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571769995/191022-sykes-meghan-harry-hero_vlgzdd", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
