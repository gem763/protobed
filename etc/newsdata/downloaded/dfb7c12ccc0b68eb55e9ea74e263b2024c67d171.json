There was Mitch McConnell\u2019s (R-Ky.) bah-humbug silencing of Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the Senate floor turned liberal rallying cry. And before that there was the pussy hat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGrab \u2019em by the p---y,\u201d Trump said on a bus with Billy Bush back in his reality-TV-star years. \u201cPussy grabs back,\u201d read the signs hovering above the pink-knit-clad heads of women at their march on the Mall after his inauguration.\n\nThis is the sort of political jiu jitsu that works well in an age of Internet-enabled mass mobilization: Turn the attacker\u2019s energy against him not by pushing back against his words but by absorbing them to your advantage. It works in the other direction, too: Remember Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cdeplorables\u201d? There\u2019s another reason, though, that the tactic is so effective today.\n\n\u201cWe must have been at two different meetings,\u201d Pelosi said in a news conference the day after the confrontation. In a way, they were.\n\nAD\n\nThe tale of the pussy hat is not the same as the tale of \u201cnevertheless, she persisted\u201d and unlike the tale of this week\u2019s Cabinet Room snapshot. Almost everyone agrees that Trump\u2019s language with Billy Bush was disgusting and degrading; women were attempting to transform it into something else entirely.\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell\u2019s language, on the contrary, wasn\u2019t disgusting or degrading. Women and their allies didn\u2019t have to transform what he said. They just had to repeat his words to point out their absurdity, because persistence \u2014 in their eyes \u2014 was objectively good. Whether you agreed depended on whose side you were on.\n\nThis week\u2019s photograph has provoked the same phenomenon, only more pronounced. This time, the object of debate isn\u2019t an argument from the mouth of someone with an agenda. It\u2019s just a picture, depicting what\u2019s supposed to be unvarnished reality. The problem is, the reality people see when they look at it is split right down the middle.\n\nAD\n\nProgressives look at the image and see a woman doing her job well and powerfully. They see a petulant man with his lips open to interrupt her and the men around him with their hands clasped and heads down in submission. Trump supporters look at it and see, well, a meltdown. Here\u2019s a lady throwing a hissy fit in the White House, and how dare she display such disrespect toward her exalted host?\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a Rorschach test for an America cleaved into two. Tell us what you see, and we\u2019ll tell you which world you\u2019re living in.\n\nThe country takes this same test every time Trump employs his typical \u201cno, you are!\u201d tactics to accuse his opponents of whatever flaws or whatever malfeasance he himself is guilty of. Donald Trump Jr. proved on Fox News this week that the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree \u2014 by arguing that the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDude your name is literally your dad\u2019s full name,\u201d someone replied on Twitter after Trump Jr. attacked Hunter Biden on Fox News for profiting off nepotism in Ukraine and elsewhere.\n\nOnly when a nation\u2019s citizens occupy distinct realities can some actually think Biden capitalized improperly on family ties five years ago and not think Trump Jr. capitalized improperly on family ties as soon as he woke up this morning. Only then can the villain and the hero in the same picture swap places depending on who\u2019s viewing it, and only then can \u201cI hate ISIS more than you do,\u201d as the president claimed about Pelosi in the same meeting, be presented as a testable proposition.\n\nAD\n\nBut that\u2019s the America we inhabit now, and it\u2019s in this landscape that impeachment is about take place. Laying out the facts doesn\u2019t change anything when at issue isn\u2019t only what the facts are but what they signify. The transcript is the transcript, but whether it\u2019s diplomacy as usual or an criminal abomination depends on whether Nervous Nancy had a meltdown or she melted down the panicked man across the table.\n\nAD\n\nThe only hope of progress or persuasion? Those Republicans in Congress with enough constituents who are looking at the Rorschach and still trying to figure out what they see.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Impeachment means you see what you want to see.", "authors": ["Molly Roberts", "Editorial Writer Covering Technology", "Editorial Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pWGSjxyhitti_JU-Q4Ai7iwxj-g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3F3NIYXQ7MI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
