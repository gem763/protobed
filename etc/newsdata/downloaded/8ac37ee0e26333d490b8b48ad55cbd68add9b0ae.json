While labor markets and consumer spending have held up well, they expect a slump in global trade and manufacturing to affect other economic sectors through sagging corporate profits, reduced hiring and a pullback in business investment.\n\nThey look for U.S. GDP growth to slow to just 1% or so in the first half of 2020, down from 3% in the first quarter and 2% in the second quarter of this year. A recession isn\u2019t Pimco\u2019s \u201cbase case,\u201d but \u201cit doesn\u2019t take much to tip over an economy that is moving at stall speed,\u201d they said.\n\nSee: Second-quarter U.S. GDP left at 2%, slower economic growth seen persisting\n\n\u201cDuring this window, we think it prudent to focus on capital preservation, to be relatively light in taking top-down macro risk in portfolios, to be cautious on corporate credit and equities, to wait for more clarity, and to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves,\u201d the Pimco strategists said.\n\nStocks are trading not far below record territory, with the S&P 500 SPX, -0.32% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.22% both trading around 2% below their all-time closing highs et in July.\n\nAmong the highlights of the investment outlook, Pimco\u2019s asset allocation team sees downside risks to corporate profit growth, they said, leading them to favor an underweight position in equities in multi-asset portfolios and a continued emphasis on high-quality, defensive growth stocks.\n\nLooking at bonds through a duration lens \u2014 duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a bond to a change in interest rates \u2014 yields continue to look too low given the firm\u2019s baseline outlook, they said. But if recession risks rise, the market could see an \u201congoing global grab for duration that may be quite insensitive to yield levels,\u201d they said.\n\nThey\u2019re cautious on corporate credit, meanwhile, reflecting both tight valuations amid above-average recession risks and worries over credit-market structure. In particular, they\u2019re watching the rise in corporate issuance and investment industry allocation to credit, combined with a fall in dealer balance sheets dedicated to trading \u2014 a source of concern about liquidity.\n\n\u201cWe favor \u2018bend-but-don\u2019t-break\u2019 credit (short-dated and default-remote) and will look to implement the high conviction ideas of our global team of credit analysts and portfolio managers,\u201d they said \u201cBut we will be very wary of exposure to generic corporate credit at tight valuations.\u201d\n\nThey also see structured credit, particularly U.S. nonagency mortgages and other residential mortgage-backed securities as offering \u201crelatively attractive valuation, a more defensive source of credit risk, and a less crowded sector.\u201d", "description": "Investors should be cautious on stocks and look to avoid macroeconomic risks as the global economy enters into a low-growth \u201cwindow of weakness\u201d that\u2019s...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS142_window_ZG_20190926115322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
