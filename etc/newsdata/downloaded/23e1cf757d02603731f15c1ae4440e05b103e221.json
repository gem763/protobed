Popular designs like Strawberry Thief adorn cushions and mugs, but do they really fit the modern interior? Surprisingly, not only have these botanical themes made a massive comeback, but Morris himself has been enjoying a new wave of popularity \u2013 as an environmental prophet and anarchist.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- What inspired the \u2018master\u2019 of fashion?\n\n- Green buildings around the globe\n\n- The rise of guilt-free gems\n\nAt the Venice Biennale in 2013, a mural portrayed him throwing Abramovich\u2019s superyacht Luna into the lagoon \u2013 symbolising Morris\u2019s outrage at capitalism. The artwork by Jeremy Deller, We Sit Starving Amidst Our Gold, was interpreted as a critique not only of the yacht \u2013 which earlier had been docked so that it blocked the view of the lagoon \u2013 but also of the crass commercialisation of art.\n\nThe British textile designer, writer, activist and leading member of the Arts-and-Crafts Movement has also recently been extolled as a precursor of green theory, according to biographer Ruth Kinna. If he were alive today, it is very likely he would be standing shoulder to shoulder with environmental protestors. He was 170 years too early, but he foresaw the ill effects of industrialisation: \u201cWhen our green fields and clear waters, nay the very air we breathe, are turned... to dirt... let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die \u2013 choked by filth.\u201d\n\nFighting the evils of the \u2018modern age\u2019 underpinned his life\u2019s work\n\nThe natural world in which he had grown up \u2013 cantering his pony through Epping forest \u2013 was being destroyed before his eyes, and the \u2018common man\u2019 enslaved to carry out this destruction. Observing the ill effects of factory work on people, Morris realised that a healthy environment was linked to psychological as well as physical health; that the landscape itself could lift spirits and contribute to psychological equilibrium. Obsessed with the pollution, congestion, and squalid industrial waste produced by the Industrial Revolution, he retreated artistically into a medieval utopia. Fighting the evils of the \u2018modern age\u2019 became, in due course, linked to his entire design ethos, and underpinned his life\u2019s work.\n\nIn 1854, aged 20, Morris and Edward Burne-Jones had travelled to see the cathedrals and churches of France and Belgium. Inspired by these buildings, created under the guild system, they pledged to abandon their theological studies and devote their lives to art. \u201cFired with the medieval idea, Morris spotted that the craft system offers labour that can be dignified,\u201d says historian Peter Cormack.\n\nSeven years later, along with fellow \u2018fine art workmen\u2019, he founded Morris, Marshall, Faulkner and Co \u2013 later to become internationally famous as Morris & Co. \u201cWe found that all the minor arts were in a state of complete degradation\u2026 with the conceited courage of a young man, I set myself to reforming all that,\u201d wrote Morris.\n\nThe new exhibition Inspired By Nature at Standen House, a National Trust property in West Sussex, UK, provides a chance to look at Morris\u2019s legacy both in the arts and as an activist. It is a particularly good place to appreciate the revolutionary nature of Morris\u2019s ambitions because the house, created by his close friend the architect Philip Webb (who had also built the Red House for him), breaks all the rules of an important country house design.\n\nArts and crafts\n\nInstead of a sweeping driveway leading to an impressive grand frontage, the first building you come to at Standen is a barn. Built in 1892-6 for the wealthy Beale family, rich industrialists (ironically) from the north, Standen is furnished from top to bottom with products and designs from Morris & Co, and the current exhibition contains a recreation of the showroom in London in which the Beales would have chosen their fabrics and wallpapers. A portrait of James Beale hangs in one of the main passages, decorated with the famous Trellis design wallpaper \u2013 an early design by Webb and Morris.\n\nArt historian Abigail Harrison-Moore explains: \u201cAt Standen the first thing you see is a house and barn almost as if Webb and the Beales wanted their country estate to be a home but not a stately one.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the building is a water tower \u2013 designed so the house could be self-sustaining with water. Internally, kitchens and servant quarters are not hidden away in attics and basements but celebrated as part of the communal life of the house.\n\nThe house is full of examples of works by others in the Morris circle, including William de Morgan and William Arthur Smith Benson, but the common theme in all of the decoration and furnishing is the application of old craft techniques and the celebration of artisan products. This, after all, was in the DNA of Morris & Co.\n\nOne example in particular that Harrison-Moore picks out is the Morris chair. \u201cIn itself it typifies all the ideals \u2013 an object found in a historic farmhouse changed into a 19th-Century design that became very popular.\u201d\n\nStanden, where local materials such as brick and tile were chosen instead of imported marbles and other stones, was one of the first houses built with electric fixtures. The importance of the relationship between function and beauty is evident in the designs for the lights by Webb that are based on natural forms. As you might expect given Morris\u2019s forward-thinking views, women designers were to be found here. The Garratt cousins, who worked at Standen, were some of the very first professional decorators, doing a job that was not generally considered right for women.\n\nHis deeper passion was for sustainability\n\nMorris made a conscious attempt to change people\u2019s lives through his design work. He was well known for his dictum: \u201cHave nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful\u201d but his deeper passion was for sustainability. He was also an egalitarian. His clients would probably have been shocked if they had known his deep concerns about his own design and decorating business \u201cministering to the swinish luxury of the rich\u201d. But the economic reality was that only the affluent elite could afford his products.\n\nIt was a dilemma that he never resolved, hoping (in vain) that consumers could be educated into buying less and regarding their purchases as investments. It was a challenge taken up later by British designer and retailer Terence Conran with his mission to bring good design to the high street. \u201cI have a Morris-like view about not producing things only the rich can afford,\u201d he once wrote.\n\n\u201c[Conran] has for some years been consumed by Morris-style fury at the failure of successive governments to pay serious attention to design,\u201d says Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy, who also curated a 2015 exhibition devoted to Morris, Anarchy & Beauty, at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. \u201cApart from the desire to produce beautiful things, the leading passion of my life has been and is hatred of modern civilisation,\u201d wrote Morris. That passion reveals itself as an obsession with the natural world. Form, Morris believed, was beautiful only if it was in accord with nature. \u201cI must have unmistakable suggestions of gardens and fields, and strange trees, boughs and tendrils.\u201d\n\n\u201cMorris\u2019s love of nature was a well-spring for his work. He possessed an understanding and deep love of all natural things: flowers, trees, birds, animals and insects,\u201d Alice Strickland, Standen\u2019s curator, tells BBC Designed.\n\nThe exhibition, which also includes exquisite embroideries by Morris\u2019s daughter May, emphasises the importance he placed on the revival of traditional skills and techniques, including natural dyeing, despite the fact that his company was guilty of using arsenic to make a green dye for wallpapers.\n\n\u201cAs with other followers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and aestheticism in general, the key motivator for his art was beauty itself,\u201d Morris expert Professor Bradley Macdonald tells BBC Designed. \u201cWith that said, beauty \u2013 and beautiful designs that draw upon nature \u2013 have critical components that remind us of the need for keeping nature intact. This point is definitely implied in Morris\u2019s writings. He clearly felt that humans desperately needed a connection to nature to live a truly human life, and his designs were attempts to keep that connection alive.\u201d\n\nInspired by Nature at Standen House, Hoathley, West Sussex, runs until November 10.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called \u201cIf You Only Read 6 Things This Week\u201d.
