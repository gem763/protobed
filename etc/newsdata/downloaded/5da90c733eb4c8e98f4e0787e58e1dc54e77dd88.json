In the wake of the fresh allegations made by Farrow she tweeted: 'I knew that Hillary Clinton's people, were protecting the Monster.\n\n'I can't believe I used to support her. I guess predators are her style.'\n\nRose McGowan, left, has lashed out at Hillary Clinton over her ties to Harvey Weinstein, pictured together right in 2004, saying her people 'were protecting the monster' and labeling 'predators her style' in an apparent attack on husband Bill\n\nThe actress, 46, launched an extraordinary attack on the former Democratic presidential candidate on Tiwtter after Ronan Farrow's new book Catch and Kill alleges her team were 'concerned' by his investigation into the disgraced producer\n\nShe later followed up with a more direct attack on the former president, writing: 'Hillary Clinton, did you have any concern for your husband's victims? And what about HW victims? No? Didn't think so.'\n\nMcGowan later said she is 'against abuse of power, whether it be Trump, Clinton, HW, @NBC ... the list is long. I'm not raging, I just really, really dislike liars and those who protect them'.\n\nFarrow's book Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to protect Predators is scheduled for release on October 1\n\nMerrill responded to the article on Twitter on Wednesday, writing: 'I genuinely respect Ronan\u2019s work, but have no idea what Weinstein was saying to people to save himself.\n\n'What I do know is simple: I\u2019d already rejected a Weinstein Co proposed doc about the election before talking to Ronan. If HW misrepresented facts, it wouldn\u2019t be the 1st time.'\n\nWeinstein raised money for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. After The New York Times reported the allegations of sexual assault, Clinton told the BBC she was 'shocked and appalled,' Variety reported.\n\nWeinstein also made a call to Farrow's estranged father Woody Allen, new book Catch to Kill reports.\n\n'Jeez, I'm so sorry. Good luck,' Allen told Weinstein, explaining that there was nothing he could do to stop the story.\n\nIn the book, Farrow goes as far as to say that Weinstein had conspired with American Media Inc., which owns The National Enquirer, and that they together were blackmailing NBC with dirt on Matt Lauer to get bosses to 'kill' his story on Weinstein.\n\nThe network said earlier this week when the allegation emerged: 'NBC News was never contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter.\n\n'And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity.'\n\nFarrow was fired from NBC in August 2017 after trying unsuccessfully to get executives to publish his reporting on Harvey Weinstein.\n\nMcGowan followed up her initial tweet with a more direct attack on the former president, Bill Clinton, writing: 'Hillary Clinton, did you have any concern for your husband's victims? And what about HW victims? No? Didn't think so.'
