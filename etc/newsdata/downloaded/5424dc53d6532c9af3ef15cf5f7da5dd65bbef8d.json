Nineteen Republican members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee signed a joint letter to the Wall Street Journal that was published on the paper\u2019s op-ed page last month with the headline, \u201cImpeachment Is What Vladimir Putin Wants.\u201d The GOP members of Congress wrote, \u201cHis goal, now and before the 2016 election, has been to pit Americans against one another and erode confidence in our democratic process.\u201d\n\nThat might be true up to a point. But the impeachment investigation might be a bit too chaotic, even for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThere are many ways in which the Ukraine affair is terrifying the Kremlin, because it threatens to unwind what little progress Russia has made in recent years and undercuts its wider goals. Putin\u2019s long-term goal is pretty clear: He wants the United States to conclude a \u201cbig deal\u201d that would revise the outcome of the Cold War and limit the strategic threat that he believes the West poses to Russia through its military expansion, double standards in foreign affairs and liberal values.\n\nPutin himself repeated many times that it\u2019s hard to deal with a United States that is torn apart by internal fighting. \u201cAs regards the developments in the United States\u2014how can we cooperate with them when they are so engaged in their domestic political affairs?\u201d Putin said earlier this month. \u201cObviously, this is always the case during an election campaign, and the United States is no exception. But this domestic political race has got a little over the top.\u201d\n\nThis is not the scandal the Kremlin wants for three reasons. First, the Russians were interested in an improvement in Russia-U.S. relations during the Trump presidency. Just after Trump\u2019s election Moscow began preparing proposals aimed at finding ground for the kind of \u201cbig deal\u201d the new American president had talked about during his campaign.\n\nBut the initial euphoria has faded. U.S.-Russia relations turned out to be worse than ever, following revelations of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Even so, Trump remains the one political actor the Kremlin has been relying on to revive bilateral relations.\n\nThis spring, Moscow began to hope that tensions between Russia and other countries, including the United States, were relaxing for the first time since Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. French President Emmanuel Macron called on the West to embrace Russia without geopolitical conditions, which was interpreted by Russia as the start of a possible d\u00e9tente with the West.\n\nEven relations between Russia and Ukraine were looking up. Moscow and Kiev carried out a historic exchange of prisoners in September. Some hoped that the exchange would open the door to progress on the Minsk agreements, the stalled framework deal of 2014-15 to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Implementation of those agreements is a prerequisite for the lifting of U.S. and European sanctions, which have hurt the Russian economy.\n\nAnd now\u2014poof. A new cycle of chaos and madness has begun, which may lead to more negative repercussions for Russia. A new wave of anti-Russian sentiment is being unleashed in U.S. politics that could trigger new congressional sanctions. No less an authoritative figure than Nancy Pelosi has suggested that Russia was directly involved in the Trump-Ukraine mess. The call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is often interpreted as an extension of Russia\u2019s 2016 interference. All the discussions about Ukraine in the United States almost always lead to Russia and become a reason to talk about Ukraine as its victim in need of protection. Altogether, any mention of Ukraine in the current anti-Russia news media further damages Russia\u2019s international image, which, of course, is already considerably underwater.\n\nThe second reason for the Kremlin\u2019s worry is that the Ukraine scandal undermines Trump\u2019s capacity to conduct his own Russia policy, in opposition to the rest of the U.S. political establishment. As far as the Kremlin is concerned, Trump functions, in Putin\u2019s eyes, as a buffer between Russia and the traditional U.S. national security establishment, which the Kremlin sees as implacably hostile. Trump has thrown overboard all of the established U.S. foreign policy approaches to Russia. He doesn\u2019t preach and he doesn\u2019t stand in Russia\u2019s way. Trump is a businessman, not an ideological warrior, and he is not impeded by annoying democratic values.\n\nRussia is ready to pay a price to maintain the Trump buffer, including enduring further rounds of Western economic sanctions. The rest of the U.S. political class, both Democratic and Republican, represents a long-term strategic threat to Russia and its geopolitical interests. Thus, regardless of whatever headaches Trump may create for the Kremlin, he will always seem like the lesser evil. Not surprisingly, whatever happens to Trump, Putin publicly supports him. But now, there is more scrutiny than ever on Trump\u2019s foreign policy conduct, and he will likely not be able to operate in secret.\n\nThe third and final reason for the Kremlin to be worried comes from the growing fear that a private presidential conversation with Trump could be published without Russia\u2019s permission. After the release of a transcript of the July 25 conversation between Trump and Zelensky, the Kremlin said that Washington would need Russian consent before publishing any transcripts of conversations between Putin and Trump.\n\nPutin is probably not worried the transcripts can hurt his standings at home\u2014in domestic affairs he remains politically untouchable. Rather, there are two other problems Putin is likely concerned about if such a transcript is published. First, Putin surely sees the transcript as a potential tool that could be used by Trump\u2019s rivals to undermine and weaken Trump, which is not good for Moscow. We know from news accounts that Trump has said some very embarrassing things to Russian officials, such as dismissing the significance of Russian interference in the 2016 election and endorsing the idea of a joint U.S.-Russian cyber unit to somehow prevent this from ever happening again. Second, the risk itself that the talk can be published is psychologically uncomfortable for the Russian president, as he likes to have intimate heart-to-heart conversations with his counterparts\u2014something that apparently worked during the Trump-Putin 2017 Helsinki summit. This is his style of dealing with his counterparts\u2014to try to find some special chemistry with other world leaders. It\u2019s harder to establish that kind of rapport while thinking that all you say might go public tomorrow.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Putin wants to sow chaos in the United States. He certainly enjoyed Trump\u2019s presidential campaign victory and its corrosive effect on American political life. But the Ukraine scandal and the impeachment investigation might be moving a bit too fast, even for the chaos mastermind. For Putin, it would have been better if the Ukraine scandal had never happened. Trump is better than a traditional American president, who would continue the traditional policy of treating Russia as a Cold war loser.", "description": "There\u2019s one thing the Kremlin wants even more than sowing chaos in the United States: Keeping Trump in the White House.", "authors": ["Tatiana Stanovaya"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/75/b5/8b8e9e694c6899437c0f5c6653cc/191018-putin-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
