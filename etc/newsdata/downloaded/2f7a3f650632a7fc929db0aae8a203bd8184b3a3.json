Read the policy.\n\n(CNN) \u2014 For much of the 20th century, the Egyptian Museum in the center of Cairo was the gold standard for collections along the Nile.\n\nMainly because among the many nuggets inside were the glimmering death mask of Tutankhamun and all the other relics discovered in the boy king's tomb by archeologist Howard Carter in 1922.\n\nBut Egypt has always had far more treasures than a single museum could display.\n\nIt's only in recent decades that a flurry of museum-building up and down the Nile has allowed the Middle Eastern nation to showcase more of its artistic and cultural heritage than ever before.\n\nSlowly but surely, the Ministry of Antiquities is relocating many of the Egyptian Museum's priceless relics from crowded downtown Cairo to a sprawling new suburban campus called the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM).\n\nLocated in Giza, the GEM will display the entire King Tut collection for the first time and connect to the nearby pyramids via a landscaped causeway spangled with immense statues from Egypt's ancient past.\n\nIn southern Egypt, the Nubian Museum in Aswan, housed inside a stunning sand-colored structure that blends perfectly into the surrounding Sahara, won an Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2001.\n\nAlong the Mediterranean shore, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina houses six specialized libraries and four separate museums inside a futuristic building whose design was inspired by the significance of the rising sun during ancient Egyptian times.\n\nTaking a cue from the historic house museums of Europe and North America, Egypt is also transforming some of its heritage homes into museum spaces like Cairo's Gayer Anderson -- which has already \"starred\" in a James Bond movie.\n\nHere are some of the best places to explore Egypt's ancient artifacts.\n\nEgyptian Museum\n\nThe Egyptian Museum in Cairo has been the go-to spot for Egyptology fans for years.
