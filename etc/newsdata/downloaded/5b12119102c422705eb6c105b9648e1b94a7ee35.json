But as they are increasing liquidity, they could lead to an increase in debt in emerging economies including those in Asia,\" he said.\n\n\"That's not to say Asian central banks should withdraw monetary stimulus. It's just that they need to be mindful of the various impacts their policies could have.\"", "description": "IMF says Japan can ramp up fiscal stimulus if tax hike sinks growth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G2AI_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
