Larson also allegedly spray-painted \u201cEVIL\u201d on the ground outside the popular tourist attraction, which is built into a red rock mountain butte.\n\nThe church vandalism, which occurred in front of a number of visitors, appears to be the latest instance of violence involving a QAnon believer. Two QAnon fans have been charged with murder in cases apparently prompted by the conspiracy theory, including the slaying of the head of the Gambino crime family.\n\nIn June 2018, an armed QAnon believer in an improvised armored truck allegedly shut down a bridge near the Hoover Dam to protest after a Q prediction failed to come true. The FBI has warned that QAnon could potentially inspire domestic terrorism.\n\nAs the Sedona vandal left the church, he warned onlookers that \u201cthe Catholic church supports human trafficking\u201d and told them to \u201cnot support Satanists.\u201d Many QAnon disciples think, without evidence, that the Catholic Church is part of the supposed global child-trafficking conspiracy in cahoots with Democratic Party leaders.\n\nBefore leaving the church, Larson left behind business cards emblazoned with a large \u201cQ,\u201d according to police. He also posted to Twitter pictures of the cards, which declares him to be a \u201cbadass patriot\u201d and a \u201chuman trafficking investigator\u201d\u2014both phrases popular with QAnon fans. Larson allegedly had a large knife and a katana-style sword on him when he was arrested.\n\nThe alleged vandal appeared to acknowledge the attack on Twitter after it happened, posting about the church in a tweet that declared \u201c#QAnon Mission Success.\u201d Larson attached what appeared to be a video of him hitting a tether ball with an American flag, with the acronym \u201cMAGA\u201d\u2014a reference to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan\u2014prominently displayed.\n\nLarson prolifically posted about QAnon on Twitter in the lead-up to the vandalism, tweeting the day before the attack that he was working for \u201cTeam Q.\u201d In October 2018, he wrote that QAnon \u201cwas a major part of my self-actualization.\u201d And in an August 2018 tweet, he called for investigations of some of the most bizarre QAnon claims\u2014including the idea that the nonexistent global cabal communicates by XBox game chat\u2014and listed astrological signs of various liberal Trump critics and media personalities.\n\nLarson was arrested a few hours following the incident after a store clerk called 911. Before his arrest, Larson had purportedly told the clerk he was \u201cinvestigating human trafficking.\u201d\n\nSedona police did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Larson couldn\u2019t be reached by The Daily Beast.\n\nDespite the growing number of violent incidents attached to QAnon, the Trump administration invited a number of the conspiracy theory\u2019s promoters to the White House in July for the \u201cSocial Media Summit.\u201d In August, a warm-up speaker at a Trump rally used a QAnon slogan during his speech, although he later claimed he didn\u2019t mean it as a signal to QAnon fans.", "description": "Self-described \u2018badass patriot\u2019 Timothy Larson, a follower of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory, allegedly trashed an Arizona church and posted online about it afterwards.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569872668/190930-qanon-tease_berqeh", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
