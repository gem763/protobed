Business customers who store their data in Microsoft\u2019s cloud retain the rights to that data, and the tech giant becomes the steward and protector of that information, he said. Microsoft has threatened to shut down data centers in undisclosed countries when such surveillance requests come up. \u201cWhenever we\u2019ve been forced to push, governments have backed off,\u201d he said.\n\nMicrosoft won a legal battle with the U.S. in 2016 when a federal appeals court ruled that the government couldn\u2019t force the company to turn over emails or other personal data stored on computers abroad. Congress, though, passed a law in 2018 giving U.S. investigators access to data stored on overseas cloud servers.\n\nMicrosoft also is taking a stand on AI-based facial-recognition systems, calling for government regulation of the technology. Laws can reduce bias and the risk of discrimination, he said.\n\nFacial recognition can have important societal benefits, he said, mentioning a nonprofit group in Brazil that reconnects families with missing children using facial recognition. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to innovate if you can\u2019t use something, and it\u2019s hard to learn if you can\u2019t innovate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company won\u2019t sell facial-recognition services for the purposes of mass surveillance anywhere in the world, he said. Microsoft has turned down a specific deal for the broad use of facial recognition in an undisclosed country, he said.\n\n\u201cWe thought it raised the risk of being used by a government to chill freedom of expression and prevent people from being able to assemble and protest,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nOther Microsoft executives have also been vocal about the need to help guide companies through ethical challenges, specifically those related to AI. Microsoft last year created a position to help companies deploying AI learn how to prioritize ethical principles, including fairness, accountability and transparency, in algorithm development.\n\nMr. Smith, also Microsoft\u2019s chief legal officer, joined the company in 1993. A book he co-wrote, \u201cTools and Weapons,\u201d was released this week. It discusses Microsoft\u2019s take on a range of societal issues that have become ubiquitous in the technology sector, including national surveillance, technology\u2019s role in public safety and challenges in rural communities that lack fast internet connections.\n\nWrite to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com", "description": "Technology companies increasingly enmeshed in social issues need to decide on principles to guide them as they face challenges related to regulatory compliance and customer trust, said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft.", "authors": ["Sara Castellanos", "Sara.Castellanos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107156/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
