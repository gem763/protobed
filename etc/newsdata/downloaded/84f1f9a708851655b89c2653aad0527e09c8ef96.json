The president uses them all the time \u2014 kind of a verbal aside.\u201d\n\nMr. Hannity tried to prove his claim by playing a montage of clips showing five times Mr. Trump previously discussed requesting favors from others, saying the examples were among \u201chundreds\u201d found by the Fox News host.\n\nHe also argued that Mr. Trump asking for a favor is on par with the president saying \u201cbig league,\u201d one of his more frequently used phrases.\n\nDemocrats in the House of Representatives initiated an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump last month after his administration tried to prevent Congress from viewing a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community.\n\nThe White House subsequently released a rough transcript of a July 25 phone call that triggered the whistleblower complaint, and it showed that Mr. Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s political opponent, former Vice President and current Democratic presidential front-runner Joseph R. Biden, while the U.S. withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in critical aid from Kyiv.\n\nMr. Trump requested a favor from Mr. Zelensky in response to the Ukrainian president bringing up defense assistance, according to the White House\u2019s version of the phone call.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump said before asking him to investigate Mr. Biden, according to the White House.\n\nMr. Hannity, 57, argued during Tuesday\u2019s broadcast that the \u201cthere were no strings attached\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s request because \u201cUkraine had no idea the U.S. had temporarily delayed aid.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported Wednesday morning that top Ukrainian government officials were aware at the time that the aid with being withheld, however, effectively undercutting Mr. Hannity\u2019s argument.\n\nMr. Trump has denied wrongdoing with respect to the Ukrainian call.\n\nMr. Hannity has previously characterized himself as the president\u2019s biggest on-air booster at Fox News, and one of his colleagues recently went as far as to say his show is single-handedly preventing Mr. Trump from being impeached.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t your show, Sean, they would destroy him absolutely. You\u2019re the difference between Donald J. Trump and Richard Nixon,\u201d Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera said on \u201cHannity\u201d earlier this month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
