To collect, they had to fill in an online form providing details including their name and address.\n\nRobyn Fleming, of St. John's, was displeased to get this email from Loblaws in March 2018, requesting she send identification before getting her $25 gift card. (Robyn Fleming)\n\nWhile many people received their card in the mail without any additional steps, some were told they needed either to mail or send electronically a copy of their driver's licence or a utility bill to Loblaws \u2014 or they wouldn't get anything.\n\nThat sparked protests from affected customers, who got the ID request in March 2018.\n\n\"It was just like, 'Oh hell, no, I'm not doing that,'\" said Suzette Collins in Toronto who refused to comply.\n\n10% affected\n\n\"Nobody should just be able to request your driver's licence,\" said Collins, who happens to work as a privacy and access-to-information consultant.\n\nAccording to the privacy commissioner's investigation, about 10 per cent of Loblaws' gift card applicants received a request to send in ID \u2014 a step Loblaws took to weed out fraudulent claims.\n\nThe commissioner also said that on March 16, 2018, Loblaws revised its communications to customers to make clear that it was only seeking information that would confirm their name and address. The grocer also indicated on its website that customers could redact sensitive information \u2014 such as their photo or driver's licence number \u2014 when they sent in ID.\n\n\"Loblaw took steps to limit the information it was collecting,\" said the privacy commissioner's report, which said it was \"satisfied with those measures.\"\n\nLoblaws said it welcomed the privacy commissioner's findings.\n\n\"The Loblaw Card program was designed to distribute many millions of dollars to our customers quickly and directly, with all the necessary privacy and anti-fraud safeguards,\" said spokesperson Catherine Thomas.\n\nDespite the resolution, some customers who refused to comply with the initial ID request never collected their $25 gift card, including Collins. She said she never received any follow-up communication from Loblaws explaining what information was actually required, or that she could redact details from her ID.\n\n\"They really don't care,\" she concludes.\n\nA number of non-compliant customers did, however, eventually receive their $25 card \u2014 in July, 2018. At the time, the company told CBC News that it was able to validate their name and address through other measures including publicly available resources.\n\nWhere's data going?\n\nThe privacy commissioner also investigated a complaint that Loblaws transferred sensitive personal information it collected from customers requesting cards to a third-party company in the U.S.\n\nLoblaws' privacy policy for its gift card program stated that personal data provided could be shared with three separate companies working with the grocer: prepaid card suppliers Blackhawk Network Canada, Peoples Trust Company, and U.S.-based legal administrative service company JND Legal Administration.\n\nThe privacy policy also stated that \"personal information may be stored, accessed or used in a country outside of Canada,\" including in the U.S. and El Salvador, where privacy laws may differ.\n\nThe privacy commissioner concluded that the complaint wasn't \"well-founded,\" because limited information was shared with third parties and Loblaws was transparent about the process.", "description": "Canada's privacy commissioner has concluded that Loblaws initially requested too much personal information from some customers before they could collect their $25 gift card \u2014 offered to make up for the company's bread price-fixing scandal.", "authors": ["Business Reporter", "Sophia Harris Has Worked As A Cbc Video Journalist Across The Country", "Covering Everything The Start Of The Annual Lobster Fishery In Yarmouth", "N.S.", "To Farming In Saskatchewan.
