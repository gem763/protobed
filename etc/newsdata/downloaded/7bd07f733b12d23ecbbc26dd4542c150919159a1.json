Late last month, he condemned Trump\u2019s false corruption allegations against Joe Biden, now at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, as \u201cbaseless\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d.\n\nTrump has lashed out at Smith, other Fox News hosts and Fox News polls.

The opportunities afforded this guy from small-town Mississippi have been many.\u201d\n\nSmith listed big stories he worked on, including the 9/11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina and the Columbine school shooting.
