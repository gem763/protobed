The woman, Bharti Singh, is the 28-year-old daughter of former MLA from Bhopal Central, Surendra Nath Singh. Bharti has approached the Madhya Pradesh High Court in order to stop her family from trying to pursue the matter and to be granted police protection.\n\nFamily claims she is mentally unstable\n\nA local news channel released a video of Bharti accusing her family of torturing and tormenting her for years. She said, \"My family wants me to get married to an MLA's son against my wish. I am being drugged with injections.\u201d\n\nHer family, however, insists that she is mentally unstable. Her father, the ex-MLA, had filed a case with Kamla Nagar police station in Bhopal, on October 16th, where he said that his daughter had gone missing and he had claimed she was \"mentally unwell\".\n\nInterestingly, Bharti went on to state that she is \u201cnot with a Christian, Muslim\u201d and that she was \u201csafe and happy\u201d after having left her home of her own accord. She also said, \"I am mentally sound. My family has gathered fudged documents regarding my health as they are influential. I am being bothered intentionally. I don't want to return home.\u201d She also added that a cousin was beating her up amid \"10 years of torment\" .\n\nHer counsel, Ankit Saxena, also informed a news wire agency that she had left home \"10-20 times\" earlier.\n\nFact stranger than fiction?\n\nUsually, when women defy their family\u2019s wishes when it comes to who they date and/or marry, they are usually forced to marry the man their parents have chosen. Even in this case, Bharti\u2019s lawyer informed the press that she had been in a relationship with a man from Pune but was forced to call it off in order to get married to a BJP leader's son.\n\nThis case sounds eerily similar to one of the weddings that was portrayed in popular Amazon TV series Made In Heaven. The show showed a politician\u2019s daughter in a heavily drugged state being forced to pose for pictures for her upcoming nuptials to another politician\u2019s son.\n\nShe manages to escape with the help of some friends and the wedding planners and then goes on to publicly marry her Christian boyfriend in a white wedding at a church.\n\nThis is probably why Bharti made it a point to mention that she was not in a relationship with a \u201cChristian or Muslim\u201d but just did not want to marry the person her parents had chosen for her.\n\nIf what she is saying is true, she\u2019s definitely not mentally unstable just because she does not want to be forced into marriage with someone not of her choice.\n\nWho would imagine that real life would be just as crazy as fiction?", "description": "In a story straight out of Amazon\u2019s \u2018Made In Heaven\u2019, ex BJP MLA\u2019s daughter from Madhya Pradesh claims she was being drugged in order to make her marry another politician\u2019s son against her will.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_MLAs-daughter-drugged-in-order-to-marry_Social_5dad7c7e545de.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
