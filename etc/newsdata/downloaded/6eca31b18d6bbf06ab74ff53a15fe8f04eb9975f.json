Mdm Ho, who also serves as CEO of Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek, made these remarks in response to a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study on \u2018housing wealth\u2019.\n\nThe NUS study showed that while Singapore\u2019s housing policies help children from lower-income families upgrade to more expensive homes when they are older, the same does not necessarily apply to children from middle-income families.\n\nThe study, that was published on 6 Oct, found that children from middle-income families tend to end up worse off than their parents, with over 50 per cent of these children who grew up in private properties having to downgrade to public housing when they are older.\n\nNoting that children from middle-class families were facing downward mobility and that there is little room for these children to surpass their parents, the researchers said that it is difficult for the sandwiched group to move up the social ladder because of the \u201chigh price and also the lack of government subsidies\u201d for private housing.\n\nEveryone should own HDB flat regardless of income ceiling\n\nResponding to the findings of the study, Mdm Ho vouched for public housing and called on people to make a \u201csmarter wealth choice\u201d and opt to live in HDB housing.\n\nown HDB Flat More\n\nEveryone should own HDB flat\n\nShe wrote: \u201cErrr\u202680% of housing is HDB. These come with various subsidies for first timers, for staying closer to parents, with excellent amenities minus the cost of maintaining private swimming pools. So families in the 60-80% income bracket may be making the smarter wealth choice going for HDB housing.\u201d\n\nCalling on policymakers to consider removing the income ceiling for first-time HDB buyers, she added: \u201cOver time, we should perhaps remove the income ceiling for buying HDB flats for 1st time property buyers/owners.\u201d\n\nCalling the ownership of public housing a beneficial opportunity and one that everyone should be able to take advantage of, Mdm Ho suggested: \u201cNow that we have stabilised the HDB housing supply, we can perhaps add a premium to the posted HDB price for new builds, based on some % of the income above the current ceiling.\n\n\u201cThat way, everybody who doesn\u2019t already own a property can benefit from the opportunity to own and live in HDB regardless of income levels.\u201d\n\nIncome ceiling lowered to own HDB Flat\n\nMinister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Sep 10, announced various housing policy measures to make public housing more affordable and accessible for Singaporeans. The housing policy measures will help more Singaporeans from lower to upper-middle income households buy their first homes and start a family. The Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Housing & Development Board (HDB) will enhance housing grants and raise the income ceilings for flat buyers.\n\nTo provide more citizen households with access to affordable housing options, the monthly household income ceiling will be increased from $12,000 to $14,000 for eligible families to:\n\nBuy a flat from HDB;\n\nBuy a resale flat on the open market with a CPF Housing Grant; and\n\nGet an HDB housing loan for the purchase of a new or resale flat.\n\nThe monthly household income ceiling for eligible first-timer singles aged 35 and above will also be raised from $6,000 to $7,000. MND and HDB will also raise the monthly household income ceiling from $14,000 to $16,000 for citizen households to buy an Executive Condominium (EC) unit from property developer. There is no change in income ceiling for CPF Housing Grant for ECs.\n\nEnhanced Housing Grant introduced to make it easier to own HDB Flat easier\n\nMND and HDB also introduced a new Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) to replace the existing AHG and SHG. To benefit more first-timer home seekers, the EHG will be made available to eligible buyers, regardless of whether they purchase a new or resale flat. To be eligible for the EHG, the monthly household income has to be $9,000 or less. The flat applicant, or spouse/fianc\u00e9(e) must also be in continuous employment for at least 12 months before the flat application, and remain working at the point of flat application. There are also no restrictions on flat buyers\u2019 choice of flat type and location \u2013 unlike the SHG, which is restricted to purchases of 4-room or smaller new flats in non-mature estates.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Everyone, regardless of income ceiling, should own HDB flat, believes the Prime Minister's wife.
