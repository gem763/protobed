The opening was a celebration for not only Louis Vuitton, but the Trump administration as the plant is set to create 1,000 American jobs over the next five years.\n\nIn response to the joint venture, Ghesqui\u00e8re posted on his Instagram a rebuke of LVMH\u2019s Arnault and Trump, accusing the president of being homophobic and labeling him a \u201cjoke\u201d in a hashtag. Trump made history in his victorious 2016 campaign when he became the first American president to support gay marriage at the start of a presidential term.\n\n\u201cStanding against any political action,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re wrote. \u201cI am a fashion designer refusing this association #trumpisajoke #homophobia,\u201d he continued.\n\nLouis Vuitton\u2019s accessories creative director Camille Miceli liked the anti-Trump post, as well as Paco Rabanne creative director Julien Dossena. Model Teddy Quinlivan, who was found by Ghesqui\u00e8re, commented with support, writing \u201cThank you for standing on the right side of history.\u201d\n\nThe Trump family has been a loyal customer of Louis Vuitton, as many of the Trump women \u2014 including First Lady Melania Trump \u2014 travel with a collection of the brand\u2019s famous logo-clad luggage.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
