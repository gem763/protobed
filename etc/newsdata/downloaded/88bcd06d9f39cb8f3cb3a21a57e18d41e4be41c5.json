Hohn, was detained a week ago while waiting for a commercial flight to his home in Hong Kong after flying deliveries throughout Asia from the Guangzhou airport, a FedEx regional hub, people familiar with the matter say.\n\nA lawyer for the Hohn family in Niceville, Fla., confirmed that Mr. Hohn had been detained in China.\n\nWhen he was detained, Mr. Hohna\u2014a wing commander at the Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma until 2017\u2014was carrying nonmetallic pellets used in low-power replica air guns in a checked bag, according to the people familiar with the matter. Chinese authorities have alleged that Mr. Hohn was illegally transporting ammunition and have begun a criminal investigation, according to the people.\n\nLike many FedEx pilots working in the region, Mr. Hohn commutes to the FedEx hub in Guangzhou from his home in Hong Kong, a city that has been rocked by pro-democracy protests for months. Border police have been checking baggage of travelers between Hong Kong and the mainland as protests have turned increasingly violent.\n\nThe detention comes as FedEx faces other investigations in China amid tense U.S.-China trade talks. Mr. Hohn was detained Sept. 12 by Chinese security officials who escorted him from a preboarding executive lounge, interviewed him at one of their facilities and retained his passport, cellphone and other communication devices, the people said.\n\nMr. Hohn was later moved to a hotel, and has been told he isn\u2019t allowed to leave mainland China until the investigation concludes, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\n\u201cChinese authorities in Guangzhou detained and later released one of our pilots on bail after an item was found in his luggage prior to a commercial flight,\u201d Federal Express said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe are working with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts.\u201d\n\nReached briefly at his hotel room on Thursday, Mr. Hohn identified himself to a reporter and then referred all further questions to a family lawyer and discontinued the phone call. According to the people familiar, he is married and a father.\n\nMr. Hohn was detained as he was waiting to board a flight with Cathay Dragon, a subsidiary Cathay Pacific AirwaysLtd. The airline has come under increased scrutiny by Chinese authorities after some of its employees took part in demonstrations in Hong Kong or voiced support online for the opposition movement.\n\nChinese police at Guangzhou airport said they haven\u2019t detained any Americans since September 12. The airport Customs Office said it had no record of cases related to ammunition that day. China\u2019s airport immigration office declined to comment.\n\nMr. Hohn\u2019s last trip had been unexpectedly extended after he volunteered to take over the flight duties of another FedEx pilot whose wife had gone into labor and who was suddenly called away, one of the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThat tacked on an additional flight from Tokyo\u2019s Narita airport. Mr. Hohn had completed that flight and was preparing to travel home when he was detained.\n\nHe had cleared security with the air gun pellets, which are often made of plastic, without any issues at both the airport in Japan and an exit-screening at the FedEx facility in Guangzhou, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nHe graduated from Niceville High School in 1989 and received a bachelor of arts degree from Florida State University in Tallahassee in 1994, according to a 2012 article marking his promotion to colonel in the local Niceville paper, the Bay Beacon.\n\nIn a video posted on Youtube from 2016, Mr. Hohn reflected about how the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had altered his life in the Air Force, setting off a 15-year military whirlwind in which he flew soldiers in and out of combat, as well as flew home the bodies of fallen soldiers.\n\nHe did a stint at the Pentagon before serving as commander of the 97th Air Mobility Wing at the Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma, according to the base\u2019s website. He stepped down in June 2017 after more than two decades in the military. An Air Force Facebook page showed him on his traditional last flight on June 13, 2017.\n\nLater that month, he was part of a group of 21 new pilots who had recently joined FedEx and were being welcomed by a union membership committee, according to a FedEx union website.\n\nMr. Hohn\u2019s detention comes as China has repeatedly accused the U.S. of fomenting the unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Tuesday said American organizations are providing massive financial support and also training protesters.\n\nFedEx is reeling from the U.S. trade dispute with China and weaker global macroeconomic conditions. Shares in FedEx plummeted Wednesday by the most in a decade, a day after the delivery giant cut its profit forecast for the fiscal year citing lower revenue projections in its Express unit, which ferries packages and cargo by planes around the world.\n\nIn June, FedEx was forced to apologize after it misrouted some of Huawei Technologies\u2019 packages, including two that were sent to FedEx\u2019s global hub in Memphis, Tenn., instead of to China. The Wall Street Journal reported the parcels were misrouted after FedEx changed its internal systems to comply with the Commerce Department\u2019s new restrictions.\n\nHuawei publicly complained, and Chinese officials said they were opening an investigation into FedEx. FedEx made another apology in June after a Huawei smartphone being shipped by a journalist in the U.K. to the U.S. was returned to its sender.\n\nChinese police have since opened two investigations into FedEx. Last month, the Chinese police said they were investigating FedEx over the discovery of a gun in a package sent from the U.S. to China. FedEx said the incident dated back to June, and that it had notified the authorities about the shipment at the time.\n\nChina has strict gun control laws and it is potentially a criminal offense to possess airsoft guns, similar to BB pellet guns, which are sometimes sold by online retailers as toys. It is unclear that carrying airsoft pellets alone would be considered a violation.\n\nEarlier this month, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said it had launched a probe after FedEx was suspected of illegally shipping a parcel containing knives to Hong Kong. FedEx said at the time the shipment never left its origin city and was handed over to authorities in the proper manner.", "description": "Pilot had nonmetallic air gun pellets in checked luggage; authorities allege he was transporting ammunition illegally.", "authors": ["Dow Jones Newswires"], "top_image": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HA919_barron_NS_20181226134502.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
