We will continue to talk with Tennesseans about how I can best serve them in the Senate and fight to pass President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nHagerty has emerged as an early favorite to replace the retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) when President Trump endorsed him in July.\n\n\u201cTennessee loving Bill Hagerty, who was my Tennessee Victory Chair and is now the very outstanding Ambassador to Japan, will be running for the U.S. Senate,\u201d Trump wrote in a Tweet in July. \u201cHe is strong on crime, borders & our 2nd A. Loves our Military & our Vets. Has my Complete & Total Endorsement\u201d:\n\nTennessee loving Bill Hagerty, who was my Tennessee Victoy Chair and is now the very outstanding Ambassador to Japan, will be running for the U.S. Senate. He is strong on crime, borders & our 2nd A. Loves our Military & our Vets. Has my Complete & Total Endorsement! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019\n\nHagerty wrote in an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart News in September that he will fight for President Trump\u2019s America First agenda and against Democrats\u2019 open border policies. He charged:\n\nBut no single issue more clearly highlights their extremism than the left\u2019s plans to radically transform our immigration system. Last year, they were calling to abolish ICE. This year they are calling for open borders. These liberal Democrats are seeking to decriminalize illegal immigration. If that isn\u2019t enough, they are incentivizing illegal immigration by offering illegal aliens everything from free college to free health care \u2014 putting illegal aliens in line ahead of your family and our veterans. And \u201cThe Squad\u201d has piled on saying that taxpayers should fund abortions for illegal aliens too. As I seek to represent Tennesseans in the United States Senate, one of my top priorities will be standing strong with President Trump against the Democrats and their liberal socialist agenda. I will fight to preserve freedom and opportunity for my children and yours, because the threat these radical liberals \u2014 and socialists \u2014 pose to the American way of life we know and love is real.\n\n\u201cWe must do everything we can to fight back, and that begins with sending President Donald J. Trump back to the White House for four more years,\u201d he concluded.\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.
