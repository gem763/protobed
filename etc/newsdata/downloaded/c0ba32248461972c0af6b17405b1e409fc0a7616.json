Asked about the corpses of Muslims massacred in Srebrenica in 1995, Handke replied, \"You can stick your corpses up your arse.\"\n\nThen again, if Handke's opinions were a cause of outrage, it was, in part, because he specialised in outrage: One of his earliest works is a play called Offending the Audience. That and subsequent works (most famously, The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, later made into a film by Wim Wenders) made him one of Europe's most celebrated writers long before his Serbia obsession. Like other artists before him \u2013 Colette comes to mind \u2013 Handke turned scandal into fame and fame into scandal.\n\nHandke also resembles other writers, Nobel laureates in particular, in his awful political judgment. The late British playwright Harold Pinter (Nobel, 2005) was only slightly less zealous than Handke in his defence of Milosevic. G\u00fcnter Grass (1999) opposed Germany's reunification and spent most of his life chiding his countrymen for their failure to confront their Nazi past, only to confess late in life that he had been a member of the Waffen SS. Portugal's Jos\u00e9 Saramago (1998) was an unrepentant hard-line leftist who, as a newspaper editor, purged and abused journalists who did not toe the Communist Party line. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1982) was a close friend of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. Jean-Paul Sartre (1964) visited the Soviet Union in 1954 and praised it for its \"complete freedom of criticism\".\n\nGiven these precedents, why has the reaction to Handke's Nobel been so neuralgic?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the answer, surely, is that Handke is considered a fascist (though his full political views are hardly clear), whereas Pinter, Grass and the others were all men of the left, whose fellow travelling with despots could glibly be excused, at least by other leftists, as an excess of idealism. After Saramago died in 2010, PEN America \u2013 an organisation explicitly dedicated to protecting free expression \u2013 paid him fulsome tribute, with no mention of his censorious past.\n\nBut part of the answer, too, is that we live in an age that is losing the capacity to distinguish art from ideology and artists from politics. \"I'm standing at my garden gate and there are 50 journalists,\" Handke complained last week, \"and all of them just ask me questions like you do, and from not a single person who comes to me I hear they have read any of my works or know what I have written.\" He has a point. He didn't win a Nobel Peace Prize or some other humanitarian award. His art deserves to be judged, or condemned, on its artistic merits alone.\n\nWhat's the alternative? Those who think that a core task of art is political instruction or moral uplift will wind up with some version of socialist realism or religious dogma. And those who think that the worth of art must be judged according to the moral and political commitments of its creator ultimately consign all art to the dustbin, since even the most avant-garde artists are creatures of their time.\n\nFor myself, I plan to add one or two of Handke's books to my shelf, at least the non-political ones.\n\nThey'll sit alongside Pinter, Saramago, Grass and, of course, Dahl \u2013 writers to whom I will always feel grateful, not least because they did not choose politics as their vocation.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Nobel literature prize winner Peter Handke has appalling political views.
