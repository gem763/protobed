England Jr. issued a written opinion saying the law likely violates the U.S. Constitution. He had announced last month he planned to block the law.\n\nThe law requires candidates for president or governor to file copies of their personal income tax returns dating back five years with the California secretary of state\u2019s office. If they refuse, they could not appear on the state\u2019s primary ballot. The law would not have applied to general elections.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said he signed the law because California has a \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d to hold candidates to high ethical standards. The Trump campaign sued, arguing the law seeks to add another qualification for running for president, something state governments don\u2019t have the authority to do.\n\nIn his 24-page ruling, Morrison wrote the state\u2019s concerns are \u201cboth legitimate and understandable,\u201d highlighting that candidates have offered \u201cunnecessary and irrelevant excuses for shielding the public from such information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not the job of the courts, however, to decide whether a tax return disclosure requirement is good policy or makes political sense,\u201d wrote Morrison, who was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush. \u201cInstead, it is the court\u2019s job to make sure the Constitution wins.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Alex Padilla said he will appeal the ruling, asserting \u201cthis law is fundamental to preserving and protecting American democracy.\u201d\n\nMorrison said the law violates Trump\u2019s First Amendment right of associating with voters who share his political beliefs. He also noted the California Legislature is controlled by Democrats, who passed a law targeting a Republican president.\n\n\u201cThe dangerous precedent set by this act, allowing the controlling party in any state\u2019s legislature to add substantive requirements as a precondition to qualifying for the state\u2019s presidential primary ballot, should concern all candidates alike,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCalifornia Republican Party chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson called the ruling a victory for voters and their ability to vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\n\u201cThis decision rightfully stops the Democrats\u2019 petty politics and their efforts to disenfranchise millions of California voters and suppress Republican voter turnout,\u201d Patterson said in a news release.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mike McGuire, the author of the law, said \u201cthe judge got it wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the brightest constitutional minds in the nation have been very clear that this law will withstand a constitutional test,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deadline to file tax returns for California\u2019s March 3 presidential primary would be Nov. 26.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The law was aimed at forcing Trump to release his personal income tax returns in order to appear on the 2020 primary ballot.", "authors": ["Adam Beam"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/judge-blocks-california-law-trump-tax-returns.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
