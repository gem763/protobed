He wanted to understand why psychopaths and narcissists are so strongly attracted to power as well as the processes by which they take over governments and countries.\n\nHe eventually came up with the term \u201cpathocracy\u201d to describe governments made up of people with these disorders \u2013 and the concept is by no means confined to regimes of the past.\n\nIn the US, for example, despite a convention that psychologists shouldn\u2019t unofficially diagnose public figures they haven\u2019t examined (known as the \u201cGoldwater Rule\u201d after psychiatrists questioned the mental fitness of Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964), many have publicly stated that Donald Trump displays all the signs of narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nSimilar cases have been made by psychologists for other \u201cstrongman\u201d politicians around the world, such as Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.\n\nIt\u2019s not really surprising that people with personality disorders are drawn to political power \u2013 narcissists crave attention and affirmation, and feel that they are superior to others and have the right to dominate them. They also lack empathy, which means that they are able to ruthlessly exploit and abuse people for the sake of power. Psychopaths feel a similar sense of superiority and lack of empathy, but without the same impulse for attention and adoration.\n\nBut pathocracy isn\u2019t just about individuals. As Lobaczewski pointed out, pathological leaders tend to attract other people with psychological disorders. At the same time, empathetic and fair-minded people gradually fall away. They are either ostracised or step aside voluntarily, appalled by the growing pathology around them.\n\nRead more: Narcissists and psychopaths: how some societies ensure these dangerous people never wield power\n\nAs a result, over time pathocracies become more entrenched and extreme. You can see this process in the Nazi takeover of the German government in the 1930s, when Germany moved from democracy to pathocracy in less than two years.\n\nDemocracy is an essential way of protecting people from pathological politicians, with principles and institutions that limit their power (the Bill of Rights in the US, which guarantees certain rights to citizens is a good example).\n\nThis is why pathocrats hate democracy. Once they attain power they do their best to dismantle and discredit democratic institutions, including the freedom and legitimacy of the press. This is the first thing that Hitler did when he became German chancellor, and it is what autocrats such as Trump, Vladimir Putin and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n have been attempting to do.\n\nIn the US, there has clearly been a movement towards pathocracy under Trump. As Lobaczewski\u2019s theory predicts, the old guard of more moderate White House officials \u2013 the \u201cadults in the room\u201d \u2013 has fallen away. The president is now surrounded by individuals who share his authoritarian tendencies and lack of empathy and morality. Fortunately, to some extent, the democratic institutions of the US have managed to provide some push back.\n\nBritain too has been fairly fortunate, compared to other countries. Certainly there have been some pathocratic tendencies in some of our recent prime ministers (and other prominent ministers), including a lack of empathy and a narcissistic sense of self importance. But the UK\u2019s parliamentary and electoral systems \u2013 and perhaps a cultural disposition towards fairness and social responsibility \u2013 have protected the UK from some of the worst excesses of pathocracy.\n\nPathocratic politics today\n\nThis is why recent political events seem so alarming. It seems as if the UK is closer to pathocracy than ever before. The recent exodus of moderate Conservatives is characteristic of the purges which occur as a democracy transitions into pathocracy.\n\nThe distrust and disregard for democratic processes shown by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, and his ministers and advisers \u2013 the prorogation of parliament, the insinuation that they may not follow laws they disagree with \u2013 is also characteristic of pathocracy.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The risk of \"pathocracy\" is always close.
