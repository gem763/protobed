Investigators faulted the poor design of the Max and a lack of regulatory oversight from the US Federal Aviation Administration, along with errors by flight crews.\n\nThe agency plans to make the report public Friday, roughly a year after the 737 Max 8 plane crashed into the Java Sea . All 189 people on board died. Ahead of the report's publication, investigators held a press conference in Jakarta.\n\nA summary of the report blames the crash on faulty \"assumptions\" made during the design and certification of the 737 Max about how pilots would respond to malfunctions by the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). CNN saw a presentation of the summary earlier this week. A press release detailing the report's findings was also released Friday.\n\nMCAS lowers the nose of the plane when it receives information that the aircraft is flying too slowly or steeply, and at risk of stalling. The system was vulnerable because it relied on a single angle of attack (AOA) sensor, investigators said.\n\nRead More", "description": "Indonesia has faulted poor design of the Boeing 737 Max and lack of regulatory oversight from the Federal Aviation Authority, along with improperly trained crew members, for the fatal crash of a Lion Air flight last year.", "authors": ["Jill Disis", "Sherisse Pham", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190915204807-boeing-190314-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
