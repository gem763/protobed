Twice.\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale author Margaret Atwood, fellow Canadian Anne Carson and Russian novelist Lyudmila Ulitskaya are among the names thought to be in contention for the prizes this year.\n\nTwo winners are set to be named because the prize was not awarded in 2018.\n\nThe Swedish Academy, which oversees the prestigious award, suspended it to make changes to its processes after it was engulfed in a sexual assault scandal.\n\nJean-Claude Arnault, the husband of Academy member Katarina Frostenson, was sentenced to two years in prison in October after being convicted of rape.\n\nFrostenson stepped down, and the events sparked a crisis in the organisation involving allegations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names. It all resulted in \"reduced public confidence in the Academy\", according to the awards body.\n\n\"Our reputation is everything,\" said Lars Heikensten, executive director of the Nobel Foundation. \"Obviously, it is important to avoid this kind of situation we have been in and of course it cannot be repeated.\"\n\nThe Academy has also made changes to its panel, bringing in several new members since last year. The body will now also allow its members to resign, and no longer tolerate members who have been subject to conflicts of interest or criminal investigations.\n\nHow do you win the Nobel Prize for Literature?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Maryse Cond\u00e9 won an alternative prize last year - and could now win the real thing\n\nAs Alfred Nobel put it in his will, the prize is awarded to the author who is deemed to have written \"the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\".\n\nSara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, has said: \"The Nobel Prize in Literature is awarded to someone who has done outstanding work in an idealistic direction that adds the greatest benefit to humankind. Nationality is expressly unimportant.\"\n\nThe winner is decided by members of the Swedish Academy, but their decision-making process is kept secret for 50 years.\n\nAcademy member Anders Olsson said they looked for a more diverse shortlist this year and were moving away from a more \"male-oriented\" and \"Eurocentric perspective of literature\".\n\nOther names thought to be in contention include Guadeloupian author Maryse Cond\u00e9 - who won an alternative award set up last year - plus Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and the Kenyan Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o.\n\nPrevious winners include Bob Dylan (2016), Alice Munro (2013), Orhan Pamuk (2006), Toni Morrison (2003) and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (1982).\n\nThe winning writer receives nine million Swedish kronor (\u00a3740,000), as well as a medal and a diploma.\n\nThe prize was launched in 1901. There are seven years during which it has not been awarded since then, but never previously because of a scandal.\n\nIt was not given out during World War One, and was also missed during four years of World War Two.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
