Belgium Italy Russia Poland Ukraine\n\nThey remain in pole position in Group D after taking 12 points from six games, but face the Swiss, who have a game in hand while trailing by four points, and then Denmark in their final game.\n\nThree-time winners Spain need just a draw away against Sweden to seal their place in the 24-team pan-European contest.\n\nSpain were held by a last-gasp Norway equaliser in their previous qualifier but are still handily placed in Group F.\n\nThey need just a point away to second-placed Sweden to make sure of their spot.\n\nWith action also taking place in Group G and Group J on Tuesday night, Sportsmail take a look at what has happened and what could still take place ahead of the final round of qualifying fixtures for this international break...\n\nSpain are on the brink of qualification and need only a point against Sweden on Tuesday night\n\nGROUP A FIXTURES November 14 Czech Republic v Kosovo England v Montenegro November 17 Bulgaria v Czech Republic Kosovo v England\n\nGROUP A\n\nEngland moved to the brink of qualification with a resounding victory in Bulgaria on Monday night.\n\nThe Czech Republic did their cause no harm at all by coming from behind to beat Gareth Southgate and Co on Friday.\n\nThey currently sit second ahead of Kosovo. Their meeting in Prague next month looks set to decide who will join England in the second automatic promotion spot.\n\nSouthgate's side know that just a point in Podgorica next month will do, while they have the insurance of going to Kosovo three days later.\n\nGROUP B FIXTURES November 14 Portugal v Lithuania Serbia v Luxembourg November 17 Luxembourg v Portugal Serbia v Ukraine\n\nGROUP B\n\nUkraine sealed their position as Group B winners with a surprise win over Portugal on Monday.\n\nIt leaves Cristiano Ronaldo and Co in a spot of bother, needing to better Serbia's results to reach Euro 2020.\n\nThe holders have the benefit, though, of kinder fixtures.\n\nThey host Lithuania before visiting Luxembourg while the Serbs host Ukraine after entertaining Luxembourg.\n\nGROUP C FIXTURES November 16 Germany v Belarus Northern Ireland v Holland November 19 Germany v Northern Ireland Holland v Estonia\n\nGROUP C\n\nGermany and Holland have now taken control of Group C.\n\nNorthern Ireland were the surprise leaders going into the international break but were beaten in dramatic circumstances by the Dutch last Thursday, conceding two late goals in stoppage time.\n\nMichael O'Neill's side welcome Ronald Koeman and Co to Belfast next week before the trip to Germany three days later.\n\nThey face an uphill task to avoid the potential lottery of the play-offs.\n\nHolland have the superior head-to-head record, crucial in deciding who tops the group. But if both avoid defeat to the Northern Irish, they will both be through.\n\nGROUP D FIXTURES October 15 Gibraltar v Georgia Switzerland v Republic of Ireland November 15 Denmark v Gibraltar Switzerland v Georgia November 18 Gibraltar v Switzerland Republic of Ireland v Denmark\n\nGROUP D\n\nThe Republic of Ireland cannot afford to lose in Switzerland on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Swiss still have three games remaining and will go just a point behind Mick McCarthy's men with victory in Geneva.\n\nIreland's last game sees them host their nemesis, the Danes, who thrashed them 5-1 at the Aviva Stadium in their World Cup play-off two years ago.\n\nAfter their dire performance in the Nations League, the Irish cannot hope on the insurance of a play-off spot.\n\nWith Switzerland staring at two very winnable games against Georgia and Gibraltar afterwards, even a draw might not be good enough for McCarthy's men.\n\nGROUP E FIXTURES November 16 Azerbaijan v Wales Croatia v Slovakia November 19 Slovakia v Azerbaijan Wales v Hungary\n\nGROUP E\n\nCroatia are in pole position in Group E. A point at home to Slovakia should prove enough.\n\nThat plays into Wales' hands, who need to win their final two games to make automatic qualification.\n\nThey have the insurance of a play-off spot, but will want to get the job done next month.\n\nRyan Giggs' side have been inconsistent with both results and performances, and could have done with securing victory away in Slovakia last week.\n\nThey toiled to victory over Azerbaijan last month, and will need to be at their best in Baku this time. Three points there could well set up a winner-takes-all play-off against Hungary in Cardiff.\n\nGROUP F FIXTURES October 15 Faroe Islands v Malta Romania v Norway Sweden v Spain November 15 Norway v Faroe Islands Romania v Sweden Spain v Malta November 18 Malta v Norway Spain v Romania Sweden v Faroe Islands\n\nGROUP F\n\nSpain top Group F and will make sure of their place at Euro 2020 by avoiding defeat in Stockholm on Tuesday night.\n\nThe battle for second is where the real intrigue lies, with Sweden, Romania and Norway all vying for that coveted spot.\n\nSweden are currently in possession but will need a result against the Spanish to keep it until next month.\n\nRomania lead Norway by three points in third and host them in Bucharest on Tuesday night. Next month they host Sweden before going to Spain for the final matchday.\n\nTwo home victories could be enough to send them through.\n\nNorway will be hopeful that a point in Bucharest will leave them handily placed with fixtures against Faroe Islands and Malta to come.\n\nGROUP G FIXTURES October 15 Israel v Latvia November 16 Slovenia v Latvia Austria v North Macedonia Israel v Poland November 19 Latvia v Austria North Macedonia v Israel Poland v Slovenia\n\nGROUP G\n\nPoland are already through and the battle for second in Group G is a three-way fight between Austria, North Macedonia and Slovenia.\n\nAustria, though, have a five point lead and with two games remaining look almost certain to book their place in a second consecutive European Championship.\n\nThey host the Macedonians next month, the surprise package in third place in the group, level on points with Slovenia.\n\nNorth Macedonia have never made a major tournament before but have to both win in Vienna and then hope Latvia - without a point in the group - can beat them in Riga three days later.\n\nSlovenia's chances are fairly slim now after falling to a slender 1-0 defeat at home by Austria this week.\n\nGROUP H FIXTURES November 14 Turkey v Iceland Albania v Andorra France v Moldova November 17 Albania v France Andorra v Turkey Moldova v Iceland\n\nGROUP H\n\nTurkey are the surprise leaders of Group H, by merit of their superior head-to-head record over world champions France.\n\nBoth sides hold a four-point lead over third-placed Iceland and look certain to book their place at next summer's tournament in November.\n\nFrance have two winnable games, hosting Moldova before travelling to Albania.\n\nIceland can, once again, upset the odds. Victory in Istanbul next month would move them within a point of the Turks.\n\nIf they require a second bite of the cherry, then Turkey at least have the kindest of final games with an away trip to Andorra.\n\nGROUP I FIXTURES November 16 Cyprus v Scotland Russia v Belgium San Marino v Kazkhstan November 19 Belgium v Cyprus San Marino v Russia Scotland v Kazakhstan\n\nGROUP I\n\nThere is, unfortunately, nothing to play for in Group I.\n\nExcept for the identity of the group winner.\n\nBut with Belgium on eight wins from eight and a goal difference of 29... surely even the impressive Russians can't stop them when they meet next month.\n\nScotland's qualification campaign has been an unmitigated disaster, but they have at least already secured a play-off spot through their exploits in the Nations League.\n\nAnd they at least have the chance to exact revenge on Kazakhstan for the 3-0 drubbing dished out to them earlier in the qualifying process.\n\nGROUP J FIXTURES October 15 Finland v Armenia Greece v Bosnia-Herzegovina Liechtenstein v Italy November 15 Armenia v Greece Finland v Liechtenstein Bosnia-Herzegovina v Italy November 18 Greece v Finland Italy v Armenia Liechtenstein v Bosnia-Herzegovina\n\nGROUP J\n\nItaly have not only secured qualification for Euro 2020, a huge relief after their failure to reach the World Cup, but they've already tied up top spot.\n\nAnd so it's the identity of the runner-up which piques interest in Group J.\n\nFinland have never been to a major tournament, but this is the best chance they have had since Roy Hodgson narrowly missed out on getting them to Euro 2008.\n\nThey are two points ahead of Armenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina with three games still to play and much to be decided.\n\nFinland meet Armenia in Helsinki on Tuesday night and know that either a draw or victory will put them in the driving seat.\n\nThey then play the two weakest teams in the group, Greece and Liechtenstein.\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina go to Greece, who have disappointed yet again in qualification in winning just one game.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Five countries have already qualified for Euro 2020 and two more can join them on Tuesday night in the final round of fixtures of this month's international break.", "authors": ["James Dutton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/19738976-0-image-a-75_1571140993932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
