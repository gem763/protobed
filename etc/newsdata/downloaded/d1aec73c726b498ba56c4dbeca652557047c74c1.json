There are hammocks in which to lie and contemplate the stunning view across the bay towards distant Osaka and even a \u201chappiness garden\u201d designed to lift the spirits of visitors.\n\nGive or take Owen Farrell\u2019s sore nose and Piers Francis\u2019s pending disciplinary hearing, the relaxed vibe currently matches England\u2019s improving mood at this World Cup. No regime presided over by Eddie Jones could ever be described as entirely mellow but even the ever-demanding head coach has granted his players the weekend off to enjoy a break from the stresses of the tournament.\n\nEddie Jones to watch Australia play Wales with one eye on quarter-final Read more\n\nJones\u2019s mischievous post-match soundbite about the squad being free to jump into the harbour or throw things around, an ironic nod to the off-field headlines that overshadowed the 2011 World Cup campaign, was a joke but summed up the improving mood. England are two from two, albeit against modest opposition, the latest fitness bulletins are positive and they now have a secure platform from which to raise their sights in terms of tournament qualification.\n\nBoth Jones and the attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, in the wake of Thursday\u2019s 45-7 victory over the USA, have been using the analogy of the Tour de France to underline the point. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the sprints and now we\u2019re at the foothills of the mountains so we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d said Wisemantel, eyes fixed on the remaining pool C fixtures against Argentina and France. Both games, he reckons, will be \u201ca huge step up\u201d on anything England have experienced in Japan so far, particularly given the Pumas\u2019 desperation to atone for their narrow early loss to les Bleus in Tokyo.\n\nThe coming days also represent a key moment selectorially, with 31 players about to start vying on a weekly basis for 23 spots. The days of mixing and matching are done, replaced by him-or-me reality. Not for nothing has Jones had T-shirts made bearing the words \u201cTeam of 31\u201d to try to ease the entirely natural disappointment of those omitted from the matchday squad to face Argentina.\n\nTake loosehead, for instance. In the absence, until now, of Mako Vunipola, both Joe Marler and Ellis Genge have made impacts, with the latter\u2019s surging upfield solo run against the USA merely the most eye-catching example. Vunipola, however, is among the squad\u2019s most reliably influential performers: do the management rush him back or reward current form? According to Wisemantel, Marler and Genge are definitely putting the pressure on.\n\n\u201cThe way the boys are going, Mako\u2019s going to find it hard to get back in the team. He\u2019s got to compete. If we\u2019re going to be consistent with the team of 31 and the mantra of it, you have to fight to get back in. You just don\u2019t walk straight back in. It\u2019s good and it\u2019s healthy competition.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never known a sport to be on a knife edge like rugby union is in Japan | Ugo Monye Read more\n\nIt is a similar story behind the scrum. With both Jack Nowell and Henry Slade back in training and Jonathan Joseph looking lively, some good players are going to be left on the periphery towards the end of next week. Elliot Daly, Anthony Watson, Jonny May and Joe Cokanasiga cannot all start, even before Nowell roars back into contention. A delicate conundrum is looming for Jones. As with British & Irish Lions tours, the moment the Test team becomes distinct from the midweek side is critical. If the bitter and twisted brigade\u2019s frustration seeps into the team room, everyone loses.\n\nWhichever way Jones goes, however, the players are suitably braced. \u201cIt puts a test on togetherness but togetherness is one of our themes and the players openly talk about it,\u201d added Wisemantel, speaking after the squad had enjoyed a morning game of cricket on their hotel tennis court. \u201cSocially they hang out and then when they\u2019re on the field they compete hard. Whether they\u2019re in the 23 or not they\u2019re competing for places, they\u2019re not just passengers. That\u2019s what we want \u2026 it creates electricity.\u201d\n\nSparks certainly flew for a second or two in the Tonga game when Daly and Slade exchanged words following the miscommunication that cost England a potential late try. \u201cI thought it was brilliant,\u201d said Wisemantel. \u201cThey ripped into each other and sorted it very quickly. Brilliant.\u201d\n\nAnd if Francis, Genge, Lewis Ludlam, Ruaridh McConnochie and Jack Singleton do end up in supporting roles next weekend they can at least take comfort from having already contributed to the cause. The Tour de France is not all about the winner; every team needs its domestiques who ride for the common good rather than individual glory. The road ahead is about to get steeper, whether people are playing or not.", "description": "Eddie Jones\u2019s \u2018team of 31\u2019 have been given a rare weekend off as the sifting starts before England\u2019s Pool C crunch matches against Argentina and France", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89de9596adb198956831674a4bfa2ed6e179116b/169_61_1992_1195/master/1992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=976fe5491d03114e19895048c7e8ff15", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
