Video of the incident shows the teenager was striking at the officer with a pole when he was hit.\n\nMr Lo refused to answer questions as to why the officer did not use other non-lethal means. \u201cIt was the attacker who decided to come so close,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had no choice, he could only use the weapon that he had available.\u201d\n\nHe described protesters as \u201crioters\u201d who were intent on \u201call these sorts of criminal damages\u201d including arson and assaulting police officers, 25 of whom had been injured.\n\nBut outside the Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College \u2013 the secondary school which Tsang attended \u2013 students chanted anti-police slogans, shouting \u201cmurderer\u201d and demanding accountability.\n\nSeveral hundred people, including students striking in solidarity with their wounded classmate, held up placards and sat cross-legged outside the school in the Tsuen Wan district of the city.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Others held their arms across the chest below their left shoulders, symbolising the location of Tsang\u2019s gunshot wound.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong police have gone trigger-happy and nuts,\u201d pro-democracy politician Claudia Mo said.\n\nHaving repeatedly viewed video of the shooting, Ms Mo said: \u201cThe sensible police response should have been using a police baton or pepper spray, etc, to fight back.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t exactly an extreme situation and the use of live bullets simply cannot be justified.\u201d\n\nThe shooting was the first using live rounds since the unrest began in June, although officers have fired warning shots in the past and protesters have been struck with non-lethal means including bean bag rounds.\n\nMore protests are planned in response, and there were reports of other schools seeing classroom boycotts on Wednesday in solidarity.\n\nMeanwhile, municipal workers cleaned up streets across the city that had been battlegrounds late into the night on Tuesday. Protesters had set fires and vandalised some public utilities, while police deployed teargas and water cannon at various locations.\n\nThe MTR Corp became a target for attacks after it made the decision to shut nearly 50 stations to make it harder for protesters to move around.\n\nBy early Wednesday, all metro stations were open although some lines were running slower than normal as MTR workers tried to repair damage to prepare the service for the nearly 6 million people who use it every day.\n\nThe scenes on Tuesday contrasted dramatically from the highly orchestrated displays in Beijing, where military and civilian parades were held to mark the fact that Mao Zedong had founded the People\u2019s Republic on that date in 1949.\n\nCarrie Lam and a delegation of Hong Kong officials attended the Beijing celebrations in what was described as a show of unity with the central government, and Ms Lam smiled as a float representing Hong Kong passed by.\n\nIn Hong Kong itself, official events marking National Day had been scaled back in anticipation of unrest. At a muted reception, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary Matthew Cheung told guests that the city had become \u201cunrecognisable\u201d due to the violent acts of protesters.", "description": "Hong Kong experienced \u201cone of the most violent days\u201d in its history on Tuesday, the city\u2019s police chief has said, as protesters clashed with police on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China.
