Phillip/AP Photo 2020 elections 'I wouldn't do it differently': Castro defends his Biden attack O'Rourke and Klobuchar knocked the offensive, while Booker and Harris were more reluctant to defend the vice president.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro on Friday defended his criticism of front-runner Joe Biden at the previous evening\u2019s debate \u2014 saying he \u201cwouldn't do it differently\u201d and insisting the apparent questioning of the former vice president\u2019s mental acuity \u201cwas not a personal attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was about a disagreement over what the vice president said regarding health care policy,\u201d Castro, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told CNN.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI pointed out this big difference in our approach and, no, Americans need to know that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe heated exchange between the two former Obama administration officials, which came as Biden discussed his health care proposal, provided perhaps the most explosive moment of Thursday\u2019s forum in Houston. Castro accused Biden of bungling his pitch, shouting at him from across the stage: \"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\"\n\nKate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and communications director, said Friday the broadside \"went over like a lead balloon\" in the debate hall at Texas Southern University, telling CNN that Castro \"hasn't learned the lesson that attacking Joe Biden in incredibly personal terms is not the way to advance yourself\" in public polling.\n\n\"I think it has generally been panned as being disrespectful and classless, and so, again, I think that was a mistake on Secretary Castro's part, to say the least,\" she added.\n\nCastro asserted Friday that Biden \u201ccouldn't hear me in the auditorium,\u201d and claimed he would have similarly challenged \u201cany opponent on stage\u201d \u2014 not just the septuagenarian former six-term senator.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/2607/1155968404_6085815684001_6085813667001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\n\"We're up there to debate, so I'm going to continue to point out the differences,\u201d Castro said. \u201cIf we're not there to point out the differences to the American people about our policy \u2014 not our personalities, but our policy \u2014 then why are we there?\u201d\n\nBut Bedingfield argued Castro's interjections were not meant to elucidate policy distinctions with Biden, and belied a more disparaging message. \"I think the implication was very clear, and frankly, it was very disappointing,\" she said.\n\nSymone Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden, slammed Castro on Friday for taking \"personal and cheap and, frankly, factually incorrect shots\" at her boss. She also warned the offensive could backfire, citing California Rep. Eric Swalwell and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand as examples of candidates who targeted Biden on the debate stage before dropping out of the Democratic contest.\n\n\"I think if you look at the history of folks deploying these tactics in a debate, it hasn't bode well,\" Sanders told CNN.\n\nMany pundits and national Democrats, including a handful of the party's White House hopefuls, have denounced Castro's verbal assault, charging that his comments constituted an ageist dig and were misrepresentative of Biden\u2019s stance.\n\n\u201cYou know, I wasn't really excited about that,\u201d said Castro\u2019s fellow Texan and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, who equated the taunts to \u201cthe pettiness, the name-calling, the small-ball politics\u201d practiced by President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThat will not defeat Donald Trump. That won't bring this deeply divided country back together again,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told CNN. \u201cSo, look, if you've got a policy difference with Joe Biden, by all means, let's air it at the debate. But that kind of personal attack I don't think is what we need right now and is insufficient to the challenges that we face.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also took issue with Castro\u2019s remarks, assessing that \u201cthe stakes are just too high\u201d in next year\u2019s election for that type of bitter Democratic infighting.\n\nAnd although Klobuchar noted that she sparred on the debate stage with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a colleague with whom she enjoys \u201ca personal friendship,\u201d Castro\u2019s barbs directed at Biden \u201cfelt different to me when he was sort of mocking him and making fun of him,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3263/1155968404_6085827928001_6085823265001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nSens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, the candidates who have issued some of the harshest critiques of Biden and his record on racial issues in previous debates, were more reluctant to rebuke Castro outright.\n\nBooker even suggested Thursday night that Castro\u2019s attack had some merit, as Democratic voters ponder whether the gaffe-prone Biden is up to the challenge of sustained battle with Trump.\n\n\u201cI think that we are at a tough point right now because there\u2019s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden's ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\u201d the former Stanford football player told CNN. \u201cAnd I think that Castro has some really legitimate concerns about, can he be someone in a long, grueling campaign, that can get the ball over the line? And he has every right to call that out.\u201d\n\nBooker appeared to take a step back from that metaphor during another interview on the network Friday, clarifying that he was not evincing public doubts about Biden\u2019s memory.\n\n\u201cI think that we all have challenges at times. I can't even remember what I had for dinner last night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is what I'm calling into question is who is the best person to unite this party to get it done, to get in the end zone, not just for Democrats but for America.\u201d\n\nHarris seemed dismissive when asked about the controversy Friday, telling CNN that \"things get heated\u201d on a debate stage.\n\nShe also declined to rule on whether the swipes by Castro were out of bounds: \u201cI'm saying that the focus should be on what we need to do to prosecute the case against Donald Trump, and for me, that is the focus.\u201d", "description": "O'Rourke and Klobuchar knocked the offensive, while Booker and Harris were more reluctant to defend the vice president.", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f8/c6/f922fa5f4021a84273f7af5865d0/190913-julian-castro-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
