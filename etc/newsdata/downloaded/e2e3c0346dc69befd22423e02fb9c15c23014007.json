Trea Turner singled on the second pitch of the game and the Nationals were off and running, ending Cole's 19-game winning streak that stretched back 25 starts to May.\n\nBRYCE HARPER SAYS THERE'S NO 'JEALOUSY' AFTER NATIONALS MAKE WORLD SERIES WITHOUT HIM\n\nNot what Cole or anyone at Minute Maid Park expected, especially after he led the majors in strikeouts, topped the AL in ERA and finished second in the big leagues in wins to teammate Justin Verlander.\n\nCole had dominated in the AL playoffs, too.\n\nYet it was a further testament to an eternal truth about baseball: It doesn't matter what you do the whole season if you don't get it done in October.\n\nSoto finished with three hits and a stolen base. Three days shy of his 21st birthday, the wunderkind left fielder also snared Michael Brantley's try for late, tying hit.\n\nThe MVP when Houston won its first crown in 2017, Springer set a record by connecting in his fifth straight Series game to make it 5-3 in the seventh. But reliever Daniel Hudson threw a fastball past rookie Yordan Alvarez with the bases loaded to end the inning.\n\nIn the eighth, Springer put a charge into a drive to deep right-center field, and it appeared as though he might've hit a tying, two-run homer. Springer took a couple hops out of the batter's box to watch, and had to settle for an RBI double when the ball hit off the glove of a leaping Adam Eaton.\n\nHeavily favored at the start, the 107-win Astros will try to get even Wednesday night when Verlander faces Stephen Strasburg in another matchup of aces.\n\nScherzer slipped in and out of trouble for five innings. But every time the stadium got rollicking, he found a way to get out of trouble. There's a reason ol' Max has won three Cy Young Awards.\n\nProjected Game 4 starter Patrick Corbin threw a scoreless sixth for the Nationals. Springer connected off Tanner Rainey for his 14th career postseason home run before Hudson fanned Alvarez on three pitches.\n\nSean Doolittle retired Jose Altuve and Brantley to strand Springer at second in the eighth, then closed to give the Nationals their seventh straight victory and 17th in 19 games dating to their September playoff run.\n\nThe Nats had a week off after sweeping St. Louis in the NL Championship Series, and easily answered any worries about whether the layoff would result in rest or rust.\n\nLeading the way was Soto, whose eighth-inning hit in the wild-card win over Milwaukee sent the Nationals on their path.\n\nFearless at the plate, he's already become one of those rare players \u2014 like Springer \u2014 who seems to turn pressure into production.\n\nSoto seemed overmatched when he fanned on Cole's 99 mph heater in the first inning. Turned out Soto \u2014 the third-youngest player to bat cleanup in a World Series game after Ty Cobb (1907) and Miguel Cabrera (2003) \u2014 was just getting warmed up.\n\nSoto justified his place in the 4-spot, launching a leadoff drive in the fourth onto the train tracks to make it 2-all.\n\nA while later, the ball was still resting there when the Nationals rallied. Eaton hit a tiebreaking double in the fifth and one batter later, Soto doubled with two outs for a 5-2 lead.\n\nZimmerman's long wait in Washington paid off when he hit the first World Series homer in Nationals history, connecting in the second. He was the first player drafted by the team, shortly after it moved from Montreal for the 2005 season.\n\nCole instantly tossed his right arm in the air as the ball took off, knowing he wanted that pitch back.\n\nEarly on, something else stopped Cole: the big World Series logo painted on the field in foul territory. He steadfastly refused to step on it, taking a detour each time he traveled between the dugout and mound.\n\nYuli Gurriel ended a string of narrow escapes for Scherzer this month. Opponents had been 0 for 17 against him with runners in scoring position in the postseason before Gurriel's two-run double in the first.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: Strasburg was 3-0 with a 1.64 ERA in the NL playoffs. He went 18-6 and set a career high for wins during the regular season. He's pitched once in Houston, throwing six scoreless innings in 2017.\n\nAstros: Verlander is 0-4 with a 5.67 ERA in five World Series starts. He got this far with Detroit in 2006 and 2012 and the Astros in 2017. Verlander led the majors with 21 wins this year and struck out 300.\n\nJuan Soto homered onto the train tracks high above the left field wall and hit a two-run double as the tagged Gerrit Cole and the 5-4 Tuesday night in the World Series opener.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNot even a history-making home run by postseason star George Springer and another drive that nearly tied it in the eighth inning could deter Washington.", "description": "Juan Soto homered onto the train tracks high above the left field wall and hit a two-run double as the Washington Nationals tagged Gerrit Cole and the Houston Astros 5-4 Tuesday night in the World Series opener.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19296056712444.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
