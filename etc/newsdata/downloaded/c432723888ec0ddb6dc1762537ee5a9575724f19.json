If I can, I think that\u2019s a good reason to keep going forward, and if I can\u2019t, I think it\u2019s really tough to conceive of continuing,\u201d he said during a Manhattan press conference, noting the deadline is Oct. 1. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019m looking at it right now.\u201d\n\nHe did not make the cut for the Sept. 12 debate in Houston, Texas, given that he failed to get at least 2 percent in four polls or 130,000 unique donors. The October debate will have the same requirements to qualify. Given that he couldn\u2019t succeed for September, it\u2019s very likely he will not be able to make October\u2019s cut.\n\nHe didn\u2019t see it that way, however.\n\n\u201cOf course it was disappointing not to get into September,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cBut I fully gathered that October was the same standards, but with a month more to achieve them.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s basically hoping for a viral moment to propel his campaign.\n\n\u201cPeople go from unheard of to totally famous in 72 hours in America now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a candidate like me, who's not that well known yet \u2014 you know, ask me in 72 hours, right? Something might change.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio is currently polling at less than 1 percent, according to RealClearPolitics.", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:10:17AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/dee2d2d2-0928-44d8-a6b8-cd5c3ad020e4.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
