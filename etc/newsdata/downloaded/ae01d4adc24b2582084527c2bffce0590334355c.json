Yet, Brexit is still looming.\n\nThis seems to have inspired a somewhat sober mood, with designers using the runway as a platform to voice bigger ideas around political tension, identity and the tremendous changes taking place in British -- and global -- culture.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from London Fashion Week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 26 A model walks the runway at the Matty Bovan Spring/Summer 2020 fashion show during London Fashion Week at the BFC Show Space on September 13, 2019.

The latter shone through this year in London where, hidden between beautiful clothes and runway shows, designers used fashion to subtly reveal their attitudes towards British and European identity.\n\nThis was even true for designers not known for politics, such as Simone Rocha, who weaves everything from her new role as a mother to her Irish-Chinese heritage into her work.\n\n\"I do keep my politics and my creativity separate but I'm very proud of being Irish and being European, so it's fitting to do something that I'm really proud of and connected to,\" Rocha told journalists after her show at Alexandra Palace in North London.\n\nWith issues surrounding the Irish border at the heart of Brexit wrangling, Rocha shone a light on Wrenboys, groups of young boys who hunted wrens on St. Stephen's Day, December 26, in Irish folklore. They'd spend the day dancing, singing and knocking on doors asking for money.\n\nSimone Rocha Spring-Summer 2020\n\nRocha's homage took the form of sharply tailored trousers, crombies and peacoats in heavy brocades and raffia-plaited accessories, from broaches to bags. The old Irish style complemented the femininity of the more voluptuous silhouettes found in layered tulle dresses and embellished outerwear.\n\nElsewhere, Burberry designer Ricardo Tisci continues to take on the difficult task of driving a heritage British brand forward in the age of Brexit. At last season's London Fashion Week, he alluded to a fractured Britain, even sending a model down the runway sporting the country's flag. This time around, he delved deep into archives to take inspiration from the brand's Victorian roots.\n\nA look from the Burberry show.

He replaced it with hand-sketched animal prints, streetwear staples embellished with crystal detailing and the sensual modern tailoring seen in sculpted sleeves, cinched blazers and corseted dresses that nodded to his Italian sensibilities. The label's iconic trench coat was reinterpreted with silk panels, taking out the rigidity and giving it a renewed sexiness.\n\nMeanwhile, Richard Quinn, known for his sculptural silhouettes, celebrated Britishness with a fantastical collection that continued to push boundaries in textiles and design with aerodynamic creations produced in his London studio. He presented his designs in an old sports hall in East London, complete with a live orchestra and choir performing Handel's \"Zadok the Priest\" and \"Memory\" by Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\nNew York Fashion Week: Here's what happened\n\nFemale muses with political stances\n\nDesigners have a long tradition of choosing strong women as muses, but this season saw a number of notable nods to women -- past and present -- who embody feminist views.\n\nTurkish fashion designer Bora Aksu paid tribute to Persian princess Taj Saltaneh, a strong advocate of women's rights in the early 20th century. He paraded a series of delicately feminine dresses in layered lace and tulle, which he toughened using block-heeled shoes and boots, tailored cocoon coats and trousers.\n\nElsewhere, Michael Halpern of Halpern presented glamorous, floor-sweeping eveningwear inspired by singer and actress Barbra Streisand, a well-known supporter of the Democratic party whose activism dates back to the early 1960s.\n\n\"What we're about is giving you the ability to escape a bit and being able to put a sparkly frock on at the end of the day is something that gives you a bit of break from watching the 24-hour news cycle. And this type of clothing is a colorful protest to make things a bit nicer and to be a bit nicer to each other,\" Halpern said.\n\nErdem Moralioglu took his narrative from Tina Modotti, a girl from an Italian village who rose to become a silent movie star, documentary photographer and political agent. Her exploits in Mexico served as the basis for a collection that featured tiered dresses in jacquard and border anglais, silk scarves reinterpreted as ponchos and flat wide-brimmed hats tied down with scarves.\n\nItalian photographer, actress and political activist Tina Modotti at an exhibition of her work in Mexico City in 1929.

The move seemed to embody their specific brand of girl power, which is built on a foundation of strong-willed irreverence and a community of supporters akin to a tribe.\n\n\"We started meeting all these M-A girls and boys and they became inspiring for our work,\" explained Marta Marques, referring to the brand's initials. \"We wanted real girls to feel their best and empowered. We feel like our mission, among other things, is to make fashion more diverse and inclusive, and more loving and accepting.\"\n\nLaura Bailey, Aymeline Valade, Billy Porter, Helen Mirren, Karen Elson and Sinead Burke attend the Victoria Beckham show during London Fashion Week.

This season, the British Fashion Council (BFC) launched a new format that opened up the catwalk to the public, somewhat eroding the exclusivity of fashion shows, which traditionally serve as trade events for the industry. Standard tickets for the experience, which included installations, panels and shows by House of Holland and Alexa Chung's eponymous label, cost \u00a3135 ($166).\n\nThe future is in the past\n\nThe past has always been a source of inspiration for designers. But this season it was also a source of comfort, as several labels gave clear nods to past decades.\n\nRoberta Einer's dreamy collection took inspiration from long summers spent lounging in seaside villas in the mid-century, post-war era. She interpreted this through the lens of her own childhood nostalgia by reimagining her favorite summer outfits -- fluid dresses in pastel shades punctuated with neon detailing, flowy silk pants and watercolor prints.\n\nHouse of Holland merged 1970s disco and 1990s rave culture with summer lurex in neon colorways, pussybow neckties and tracksuits. \"It's a real exploration of those two periods because I see real similarities between them and now,\" founder Henry Holland said of his collection. \"It's a period in history where people just didn't know what to do with the state of the world and just (went) out and partied to forget their cares.\"\n\nA model walks the runway at the House of Holland & Self-Portrait show.

Protest group Extinction Rebellion staged a \"die in\" outside the BFC Show space, featuring activists covered in fake blood.\n\nThey held signs featuring slogans like \"Fashion = Ecocide\" and \"The ugly truth about fashion,\" yelling at guests waiting in line to enter the venue.\n\nVictoria Beckham Spring-Summer 2020 Credit: Victoria Beckham\n\nOne of their most visible efforts was protesting outside the Victoria Beckham show, where high-profile guests including editor Anna Wintour and actors Helen Mirren and Billy Porter were in attendance.\n\nThe fashion industry is far from achieving sustainability, and its efforts to reduce their environmental impact have actually slowed down in the last year, according to a new report published by Global Fashion Agenda, Boston Consulting Group and Sustainable Apparel Coalition.\n\nAs a whole, fashion emits more greenhouse gases than the sum of all commercial flights and maritime shipping, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n\nAmong the positive signals is the fact that several high-profile brands are designing their shows to be carbon-neutral, a trend inaugurated by Gabriela Hearst in New York last week, followed up by Burberry in London this week and embraced by Gucci for its upcoming show in Milan -- showing that big labels are starting to acknowledge the fact that the sustainability factor is at least as important as the wow factor.\n\nFor more on London Fashion Week, watch the video above.", "description": "The five-day event delivered a series of especially impressive collections that blended eccentricity, intelligence and -- perhaps inevitably -- politics.", "authors": ["Samantha Tse"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190916171015-kendall-jenner-blonde-hair-burberry-london-fashion-week-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
