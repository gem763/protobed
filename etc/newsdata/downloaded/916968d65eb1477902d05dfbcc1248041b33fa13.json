Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian officials.\n\nComey signed off on an investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia during the 2016 election and later emerged as a prominent critic of the president after Trump fired him in May 2017. Trump and many of his allies say that investigation should never have begun.\n\nThe Justice Department appointed a special counsel, Robert Mueller, to handle the investigation after Comey left. That probe unearthed numerous contacts between the campaign and Russian officials but concluded that there was not enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy.\n\nMueller\u2019s final report did not reach a conclusion as to whether Trump\u2019s efforts to interfere with the probe amounted to criminal obstruction of justice, but it also did not exonerate the president. Attorney General William Barr concluded that he did not see enough evidence to bring obstruction charges.\n\nThe Inspector General said on Thursday that while Comey\u2019s memo did not contain classified material, he set a dangerous example when he shared sensitive information to create public pressure for official action.\n\n\u201cWere current or former FBI employees to follow the former Director\u2019s example and disclose sensitive information in service of their own strongly held personal convictions, the FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly,\u201d the report said.\n\nComey said on Twitter that people who have accused him of sharing classified information should apologize.\n\n\u201cTo all those who\u2019ve spent two years talking about me \u2018going to jail\u2019 or being a \u2018liar and a leaker\u2019\u2014ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president,\u201d he said.\n\nSECOND TIME\n\nIt is the second time Comey has been criticized by the Inspector General\u2019s office, which concluded last year that he made a \u201cserious error of judgment\u201d when he announced shortly before the 2016 election that he was re-opening an investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server when she was secretary of State.\n\nTrump said on Thursday: \u201cPerhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General\u2019s Report. He should be ashamed of himself!\u201d\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham called Comey a \u201cliar and a leaker\u201d and said his decision to share information with the press led to a \u201cbaseless, politically motivated, two-year witch hunt.\u201d\n\nComey wrote seven memos during the first few months of Trump\u2019s presidency, detailing one-on-one meetings in which Comey says Trump demanded loyalty and tried to influence the actions of the FBI, which is supposed to enforce the law in an impartial manner.\n\nThe Inspector General\u2019s report said Comey should not have held on to the memos after he was fired because they were official FBI documents. Comey gave one of them to his friend Dan Richman and told him to share it with a New York Times reporter, according to the report. Richman declined to comment.\n\nCongress made redacted versions of those memos public last year.\n\nFBI spokesman Brian Hale said the report underscored the need for all agency employees, regardless of position, to obey rules about official records. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nSome Republicans said the Inspector General\u2019s report provides more evidence that the FBI was motivated by political considerations when it started investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what I expect will be several more ugly and damning rebukes of senior DOJ and FBI officials regarding their actions and biases toward the Trump campaign of 2016,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said in a statement.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey departs after giving a private deposition to the House Judiciary and House Government and Oversight committees on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nThe Inspector General\u2019s office is currently examining the FBI\u2019s conduct during the investigation, and Barr is also overseeing two inquiries into the origins of the Mueller probe: one led by John Durham, the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut, and another involving senior intelligence officials.\n\nAlthough the Justice Department will not prosecute Comey, he could face other disciplinary action because the Inspector General\u2019s report has been referred to the FBI and the department\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigates employee misconduct.\n\nDemocrats in Congress are split as to whether Trump should be impeached for the actions detailed in Mueller\u2019s report, while Republicans have largely stood by the president.", "description": "The U.S. Justice Department has decided not to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey despite an internal investigation that found he improperly leaked information to the news media, the department's internal watchdog said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Andy Sullivan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190830&t=2&i=1424238536&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7S1HS"}
