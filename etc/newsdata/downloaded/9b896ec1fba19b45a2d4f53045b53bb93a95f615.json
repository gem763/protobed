Johnson Says Trump Blocked Ukraine's Aid", "language": "en", "text": "(WASHINGTON) \u2014 A Republican senator said Friday he learned from a U.S. ambassador that President Donald Trump was tying military aid for Ukraine to an investigation of the 2016 election. But when the senator asked Trump if he could assure the Ukraine leadership the money would be coming, the president blocked him from carrying that message.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a leader of the Senate\u2019s Ukraine caucus, made several trips to the Eastern European ally this year after the election of President Volodymyr Zelensky. He told the Wall Street Journal that Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, told him the Ukraine aid, which is part of the country\u2019s defenses against Russia, was being linked to Trump\u2019s desire to have Zelensky\u2019s team investigate the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nSeparately, Johnson told reporters in Sheboygan, Wis., that Trump had blocked his suggestion that he carry a message to Ukraine\u2019s president assuring him that U.S. military aid was on the way. \u201cI was surprised by the president\u2019s reaction and realized we had a sales job to do,\u201d Johnson told reporters.\n\nThe senator\u2019s remarks fill in more details about events at the heart of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The probe deepened this week with the release of text messages in which Sondland and other diplomats tried to broker a meeting between Trump and Zelensky, on the condition that Ukraine open an investigation into a gas company where Joe Biden\u2019s son had served on the board.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He also agrees with Trump\u2019s desire to have NATO allies contribute more money toward their security.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m completely sympathetic with President Trump wanting to get the truth, where did this Russia narrative begin?\u201d Johnson said about the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI take what President Trump is saying at face value,\u201d said Johnson, who\u2019s leading some of those investigations, including calling on the Justice Department to probe a Ukrainian company affiliated with Biden\u2019s son. He said Trump is \u201cconcerned about corruption and continues to say European allies need to step up.\u201d\n\nJohnson was among those who traveled to Ukraine in May, with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, for Zelensky\u2019s inauguration after Vice President Mike Pence was unable to make the trip. On his return, Johnson joined others to brief Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nJohnson recalled Friday that he and others were confident in the new Ukrainian president and wanted to share their enthusiasm with Trump. \u201cWe were trying to encourage the president to show a great deal of support\u201d in backing the new leader, he told reporters in Wisconsin.\n\nAhead of his next trip to Ukraine, in September, he told the Wall Street Journal he was informed by Sondland of the tie-in to the military aid. \u201cAt that suggestion, I winced,\u201d Johnson told the Journal. \u201cMy reaction was: Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined.\u201d\n\nSondland would have known what was under way. It was about that time, in August, that the top diplomat and two others were scrambling to prevent their attempt to broker a meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy spiral into a quid-pro-quo for the military aid, according to text messages released by the chairmen of the House oversight committees in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nJohnson said that in a call with Trump the next day he tried to convince the president to let him tell Zelensky the military aid would be coming but was rebuffed.\n\nRepublicans has been reluctant to break with Trump, and Johnson also suggested he was standing by the president. \u201cI certainly understood President Trump had real concern about corruption in general,\u201d Johnson said Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sympathetic to the fact what he\u2019s been dragged through,\u201d he said about the 2016 election investigations. \u201cHe\u2019d like to understand what happened.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Johnson, a Republican senator said he learned President Trump was tying military aid for Ukraine to an investigation of the 2016 election", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ron-johnson-trump-ukraine-aid.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
