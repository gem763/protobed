The changes are meant to improve how the technology that underpins the world's largest search engine understands the ways language and context work together \u2014 and give users better responses to their searches, from \"can you get medicine for someone pharmacy\" to \"parking on a hill with no curb.\" On Friday, the company announced that it is starting to use an artificial intelligence system developed in its research labs, known as BERT (which stands for \"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\"),to help answer conversational English-language queries, initially from US users. The changes are meant to improve how the technology that underpins the world's largest search engine understands the ways language and context work together \u2014 and give users better responses to their searches, from \"can you get medicine for someone pharmacy\" to \"parking on a hill with no curb.\"\n\nGoogle search engine opened on computer monitor at the home page ready for a search string to be typed into the blank search box.

BERT should be more adept at understanding the key word \"no,\" and give a result that reflects that.\n\nRead More", "description": "Google is rolling out new technology to improve the results it serves up when you type in a search query, though you might not even notice.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191025032812-google-iphone-x-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
