We have demanded that the management of the company resolve this as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nApology\n\nPawnbrokers allow customers to offer something valuable as security for a loan, or buy items such as jewellery and antiques. They lend money quickly, but usually at a worse rate than banks.\n\nStores also often offer other financial services such as currency exchange and buying gold.\n\nThe company said that any items pawned in A&B stores will be transferred to a central store, and can be redeemed or sold through this operation.\n\n\"If your items are expired or due to expire, please note we will not take any action with your items until we speak to you,\" the website said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we were unable to contact all customers prior to the closure date. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.\"\n\nLetters have been sent by Albemarle & Bond, which was established in 1840, to customers as stores closed.\n\nHelplines\n\nBBC News has been unable to contact anyone from the company to explain the extent of the closures or the reasons for them.\n\nThe regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said it was aware that companies operated by Speedloan had closed stores.\n\n\"We are engaging with the firm and asking them to ensure this process is carried out in an orderly manner and to minimise disruption to Speedloan's customers,\" the FCA said.\n\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service said it had received calls from frustrated customers unable to get through to the company and were worried about their items.\n\nCustomers can contact the company on 01865 798114 which is a dedicated hotline. If customers are not happy with the response from the company, they can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service to complain on 0800 023 4567, or the FCA customer helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\nHow does pawnbroking work?\n\nCustomer \"pledges\" an item, such as a gold ring for a set period of time, usually six months\n\nPawnbroker gives 50% to 60% of the item's value as a cash loan\n\nCustomer pays 7% to 8% interest every month\n\nAn item can be redeemed during the loan period by paying back the original loan and any interest up to that point\n\nIf the customer cannot repay the loan at the end of the deal the pawnbroker sells the item and returns any surplus to the customer\n\nMore information is available from the National Pawnbrokers Association. Consumer advice on pawnbroking is available from Citizens Advice and the Money and Pensions Service\n\nAre you a customer of Albemarle & Bond or Hebert Brown?
