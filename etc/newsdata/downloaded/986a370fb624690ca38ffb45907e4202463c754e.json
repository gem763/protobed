Their bodies were discovered in the back of the lorry in an industrial estate in Grays early on Wednesday.\n\nTwo journeys into one: how lorry driver and Chinese nationals reached Essex Read more\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian on Friday, Coens confirmed that the container passed through a terminal at the port, run by the company C.RO. \u201cThey, of course, do everything possible, together with us, to avoid that people are entering the terminal. That\u2019s the main thing. You can see it\u2019s wired, it\u2019s fenced, it\u2019s locked. It\u2019s a closed terminal.\u201d\n\nCoens and Degroote said \u20ac1m (\u00a3860,000) was spent each year to protect the terminal, which is one of several at the port, which processes up to 7,000 containers daily and is guarded round the clock by security staff, who deploy six sniffer dogs.\n\nCoens said police dealt \u201cdaily\u201d with small groups of migrants attempting to cut holes in fences and gain access to the port. \u201cThey are smaller groups, people are mostly coming from conflict areas in north Africa, Eritrea, the Middle East. They [the port security] cope, in the way that they can keep the people out. If they are caught they go to the police.\u201d\n\nDegroote, who is one of four harbourmasters at the port, said lorries arriving with containers were photographed from all angles \u2013 \u201cbelow, underneath, everything\u201d.\n\nCoens explained that lorries with canvas containers were checked inside with CO2 devices to see if humans were present, and sniffer dogs were also deployed.\n\nBut asked if there were any other checks on sealed refrigerated containers, Coens said there was not. \u201cIf it\u2019s sealed in a cooled container under temperature control, no.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that the terminal is completely fenced and looked at with cameras and security guys running around daily \u2013 they cost millions \u2013 to see that there\u2019s nobody running around.\n\n\u201cSo we, the terminal, suppose that there is nobody around and the container is closed and finished and we\u2019re good so there is no need to open it. Because otherwise you unseal it and you have the butter or the meat, or whatever [is inside], and it contaminates and you have to seal whatever is in.\u201d\n\nDegroote said some containers spot-checked by police and customs officials were x-rayed, but he estimated that just 1% of trailers were subject to the procedure. \u201cBut that\u2019s not to find people \u2026 the customs are focusing on goods. So that\u2019s what their checks are made for.\u201d\n\nCoens added: \u201c[It is] to check if you declare to bring butter and it\u2019s not butter inside but kalashnikovs [guns].\u201d\n\nHe said the percentage of sealed containers passing through Zeebrugge to the UK that were x-rayed was \u201c1%, maybe. It\u2019s a very low figure.\u201d\n\nBoth men confirmed there were no heat scanners at the port. It has been suggested that the refrigerated container\u2019s sub-zero temperatures may have been deliberately used to fool a heat scan.\n\nCoens suggested British authorities should be more involved in carrying out checks. \u201cIt\u2019s one or the other. If you do it here there should be more involvement of the UK side.\u201d\n\nBelgian prosecutors opened an investigation into the deaths on Thursday.\n\nCoens \u2013 who has worked at the port for 18 years \u2013 said: \u201cThe investigation is important for us to see from the beginning to the end what happened and what could be done.\n\n\u201cEvery time there is an incident, with every meeting we have with police and customs \u2026 we follow their instructions. It has been adapted year by year by new methods, so we adapt every time. So if there is something more we can do, we can definitely do [it], that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nDeegroote added: \u201cThe port is a part of the whole link. It starts where the truck leaves and we are being funnelled into the problem because that\u2019s the point where the cargo stops. Maybe we can do more, depending on the lessons learned from the investigation.\u201d\n\nNineteen years ago, 58 Chinese migrants suffocated in a lorry in Dover after travelling through Zeebrugge.", "description": "Chief executive defends security measures after discovery of 39 bodies in lorry in Essex", "authors": ["Simon Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/180f7087a26d7a416191e3f78fb77a7d3ed9f835/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=05e2ac2b358f6c37fb6eded9103d10ba", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
