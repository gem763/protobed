Another man was shot in the arm and upper body in the Fairlawn neighborhood of Southeast Washington, and another was shot inside a house in Shaw in Northwest. Both of those victims survived.\n\nAD\n\nThe incident in Shaw occurred before 3 a.m. in the 1300 block of Seventh Street NW, a block south of the Kennedy Recreation Center. Police said the victim took himself to a hospital to treat a gunshot wound to his arm. No arrest has been made.\n\nAD\n\nIt was not immediately clear if that shooting is related to several others that have occurred in the Shaw neighborhood since Sept. 29, when a man was fatally shot. Two other people, including a teenage girl tying her shoe outside a grocery store at Eighth and P streets, were shot in separate attacks in Shaw over the weekend. Police described the girl as a bystander.\n\nLater Sunday night, a man in a vehicle fired on another car as they sped up Sixth Street in Northwest. No one was hit, police said. Community meetings to address the violence are scheduled for 7 p.m. Wednesday at the Shaw Watha T. Daniel Library and 6 p.m. Thursday at the United House of Prayer.\n\nAD\n\nThe shooting in Northeast Washington occurred in the 5200 block of Sheriff Road, a popular gathering spot outside a small commercial strip that contains a barbershop called Nooks and a day-care center.\n\nAD\n\nPeople who hang out there have complained about police harassment, and a confrontation with officers in the summer of 2018 led to a day-long hearing before the D.C. Council to examine police conduct. The District\u2019s police chief has said the area is known for drug dealing and asserted that people there bait his officers to force entanglements.\n\nEarlier this year, a 17-year-old was shot in the back in that area when 40 or more bullets were sprayed in front of the barbershop in the middle of the afternoon.\n\nAD\n\nIn July, Dominic Robinson, 32, was shot and killed near Sheriff Road. He had been one of the central activists complaining about police and had testified at the council hearing. No arrest has been made.\n\nPolice did not comment on a possible motive in the latest shooting on Sheriff Road on Tuesday. A police report says the victim was found in front of Nooks and was rushed to a hospital unconscious. The victim\u2019s mother, Monica Better, 45, identified the victim as Kevin Eli Better. A police report confirmed the name.\n\nAD\n\nBetter said her son, who lives with her near Dupont Park in Southeast, hung out on Sheriff Road with childhood friends. She said she did not believe her son took part in the confrontations with police. He has no adult criminal record in the District. Better said he has two brothers, three sisters and a 2-year-old daughter.\n\nAD\n\nBetter said she worried about her son hanging out on Sheriff Road and called him frequently asking when he would come home. \u201cHe stays pretty much to himself,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the rowdy type.\u201d\n\nShe said she talked with some people who were there when the shooting occurred and that they told her \u201csomeone came through and started shooting at the area where he was standing. That\u2019s all I know. I still need to get some answers.\u201d\n\nBetter said doctors told her initial tests showed her son has no brain function, and he has been put on a breathing tube. She said \u201cas long as he\u2019s got a pulse, and he\u2019s got a heartbeat, I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "D.C. police are investigating two other shootings on Tuesday night, including one in Shaw.", "authors": ["Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
