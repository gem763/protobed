Most of all, it cements Moscow\u2019s new role as prime powerbroker in the Middle East as US influence in the region wanes.\n\nTurkish troops in areas of north-east Syria seized since the start of the 9 October offensive will remain in situ, and Russian troops and the Syrian army will control the rest of the frontier, effectively fulfilling the goal of Turkey\u2019s Operation Peace Spring at Russia\u2019s discretion: the dilution of Kurdish control over the 270-mile (440km) border corridor.\n\nRussian military police and Syrian border guards controlled by President Bashar al-Assad will from Wednesday at noon facilitate the removal of Kurdish fighters and weaponry to the depth of 18 miles from their positions on the border, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said after their respective presidents announced the agreement to reporters.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG element of the multi-ethnic SDF has 150 hours to withdraw, a joint statement said, and then Turkish and Russian soldiers will begin joint patrols of the entire border area to a depth of 10km with the exception of the de-facto Kurdish capital, Qamishli. The deal appears to also include the contested strategically key town of Manbij as well as the important Kurdish town Kobane. It made no mention of the long-term presence of troops loyal to Assad, now also present in the proposed border zone.\n\nNo comment on the deal from the SDF or Kurdish political leaders was immediately forthcoming. The umbrella force\u2019s commander-in-chief, Mazloum Kobane, confirmed earlier on Tuesday that his fighters had withdrawn from the border strip between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, the two towns bearing the brunt of the Turkish attack, hours before the poorly observed US-brokered ceasefire ended.\n\nThe chain of events triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s 6 October announcement that US troops would leave Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria has left Moscow the most powerful player in Syria\u2019s complex war, now in its ninth year.\n\nTurkish troops, allied Syrian rebel proxies, the SDF, and soldiers belonging to Assad are now all present in the border zone, with Russia the only negotiating force between them.\n\nTrump has been widely criticised for his decision to pull back the remaining 1,000 US special forces from the region, which in effect greenlit the Turkish attack on the SDF, the US\u2019s ground partner in the five-year-campaign to defeat Isis. Ankara, however, has long maintained the main Kurdish unit in the SDF is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK).\n\nAs a result of the Turkish offensive, Syria\u2019s Kurdish officials struck a deal with Assad, their former enemy, for military reinforcements in the border area.\n\nAnkara will be pleased that Moscow has persuaded Damascus to cede it control over more territory in the north-east, breaking up Kurdish control. In return, Moscow appears to have extracted commitments from the Turkish delegation that Turkey will respect Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, raising questions over the future of nearby rebel-held Idlib province, where Turkey maintains observation posts.\n\nAssad himself has repeatedly vowed to reunite his entire country under Damascus\u2019s rule. In a symbolic visit to southern Idlib on Tuesday \u2013 territory the regime now occupies for the first time in years \u2013 he called Erdo\u011fan \u201ca thief\u201d and said he was ready to support any popular resistance against Turkey\u2019s invasion.\n\n\u201cWe are in the middle of a battle and the right thing to do is to rally efforts to lessen the damages from the invasion and to expel the invader sooner or later,\u201d he told troops, adding that Kurdish fighters would be granted an amnesty if they returned to the fold of the Syrian government.\n\nAt least 120 civilians in Syria and 20 in Turkey have died as a result of the almost two-week old assault, with 176,000 Syrians displaced by the violence, the UN said on Tuesday. Intermittent fighting has continued despite a US-brokered ceasefire announced by Mike Pence, the American vice-president, on a visit to Ankara last Thursday.\n\nLast week\u2019s US-Turkish agreement did not specify the zone\u2019s size, where Turkey also plans to repatriate up to 2 million of its 3.6 million Syrian refugee population - a policy dubbed demographic engineering by critics.\n\nPrevious agreements between Washington and Ankara over a safe zone along the Syria-Turkish border floundered time and again over diverging definitions of the area.\n\n", "description": "Erdo\u011fan hails agreement with Putin in which Kurdish fighters will be moved from border area", "authors": ["Bethan Mckernan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b3c3fc9170d8893cbe46b662f8f3855b69ddc09/0_118_4088_2453/master/4088.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a3ac174fffca07318ee6aade0dc46c8", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
