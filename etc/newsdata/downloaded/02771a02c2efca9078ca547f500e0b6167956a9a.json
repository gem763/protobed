It was not immediately known if he had an attorney.\n\nAfter reports of Miller's death circulated, Pettit sent an Instagram message to a friend saying, \"Most likely I will die in jail,\" according to the affidavit.\n\nPettit goes on to write, \"I'm gonna get off the grid. Move to another country.\"\n\nInvestigators also obtained text messages between Miller and Pettit before the sale, in which Miller proclaims his love for oxycodone, or \"percs\" for the brand name Percocet, and also asks for \"bars\" of Xanax and a \"ball\" of cocaine.\n\nRead more: Mac Miller was known for brutally honest lyrics that explored addiction and death \u2014 here are his 10 most personal songs\n\n\"When can u get em?\" Miller asks, according to a transcript of the exchange contained in court filings.\n\n\"Probably in an hour or 2. They are 30 ea,\" Pettit replies.\n\n\"Any chance I can get 10 of those, 10 bars and a ball?\" Miller asks.\n\n\"Yeah for sure,\" Pettit replies.\n\nThe autopsy report found that Miller had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, but had not previously overdosed or been hospitalized for any reason.\n\nThe report notes that Miller's many tattoos included one of an hourglass on his arm with the words, \"Only so much time left in this crazy world.\"\n\nMiller's assistant told investigators he was feeling positive about the projects he was working on, but had a tendency to slip into drug binges.\n\nU.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said in a statement after Pettit's arrest that \"Fentanyl disguised as a genuine pharmaceutical is a killer \u2014 which is being proven every single day in the United States.\"\n\nThe charges were first reported Wednesday by NBC News.\n\nA Pittsburgh native whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, Miller's rhymes included frank discussion of his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop.\n\nPerformers at a concert in his honor included Chance the Rapper and Travis Scott.\n\nHe was also in a two-year relationship with Grande that ended earlier in 2018. After his death she posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, \"Thank U Next,\" that lovingly mentions him, saying, \"Wish I could say thank you to Malcolm ... Cause he was an angel.\"\n\nMiller is the latest musician whose death has been linked in recent years to a national wave of opioid abuse and overdoses. Prince died in 2016 when he took counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl that looked like a generic version of the painkiller Vicodin.\n\nMatthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016, and had fentanyl and hydrocodone in his system.", "description": "Cameron Pettit was arrested on charges that he sold counterfeit drugs to Mac Miller, two days before the rapper died of an overdose.", "authors": ["Andrew Dalton", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b94f693672e162ca02d01f5-1920-960.jpg"}
