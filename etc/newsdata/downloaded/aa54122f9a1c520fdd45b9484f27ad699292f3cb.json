This app violates our guidelines and local laws,\u201d the company said in a statement posted on Twitter by MSNBC media reporter Dylan Byers.\n\nApple had come under vigorous fire this week in the People\u2019s Daily, the official paper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which called the American firm an \u201cescort\u201d for \u201crioters\u201d and said Chinese should boycott the company\u2019s products.\n\nThe reversal comes in the context of a flurry of American and Western companies taking actions widely seen as contrary to democratic values, and their stated corporate commitments to them, to preserve access to the communist dictatorship\u2019s lucrative market.\n\nThe National Basketball Association had several events canceled by China, and the Houston Rockets especially singled out, after Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet supporting democracy in Hong Kong\n\nRockets star James Harden tweeted an apology \u2014 to China. Such outspoken liberals as guard Steph Curry and coach Steve Kerr refused to comment or talked around such matters as China\u2019s human-rights abuses in Hong Kong and elsewhere.\n\nOther such capitalist brands as Marriott International, Activision Blizzard gaming and jeweler Tiffany & Co. have done things to appease China\u2019s dictators.\n\n\u2022 Valerie Richardson contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
