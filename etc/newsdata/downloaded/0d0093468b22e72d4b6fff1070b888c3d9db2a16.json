Current government funding lasts through Nov. 21.\n\nTrump signed into law a two-year budget agreement in August that was supposed to end the threat of another shutdown. But despite that deal \u2014 which was hammered out by Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin \u2014 there has been almost no progress on the individual appropriations bills that must be passed for fiscal year 2020.\n\nSome Democrats complain that the White House wants to negotiate over border wall funding, something Pelosi and her leadership team have refused to do. House Democrats are currently suing Trump over his move to divert billions of dollars in Pentagon funds for the wall project, which Democrats have blasted as a violation of Congress\u2019 power over the purse.\n\nRepublicans say there should be room to negotiate on Trump\u2019s border wall. The White House is seeking $8 billion for the project as part of its budget request, which Democrats have dismissed as a non-starter. The Homeland Security Department funding bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee includes $5 billion for the wall despite strong Democratic objections.\n\nBut Republicans are warning that if there is no deal and a full-year continuing resolution is enacted, Trump will grab funds for the wall anyway using his executive authority.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he was encouraged by Tuesday\u2019s session with Hill aides and White House officials, saying it showed \u201csome progress.\u201d\n\nBut he also criticized Trump.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s meddling and erratic behavior caused the last government shutdown, the longest in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Schumer said. Trump demanded more than $5 billion for his border wall and eventually reopened the government without getting Congress to give in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way past time for Democratic and Republican appropriators to sit down and hammer out a bipartisan agreement on allocations to the various agencies, known as the 302Bs. That\u2019s\u2019 how we got this done in the past,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning. Schumer also urged the White House \u2014 specifically Trump \u2014 to stay out of the spending fight.\n\n\u201cI believe there was a meeting yesterday, and I think some progress was made,\u201d Schumer added. \u201cLet\u2019s continue moving in that direction \u2014 the four corners of the Appropriations Committee, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans \u2014 and put together an agreement that we can all support.\u201d\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) was mum on whether a Tuesday meeting between his staff and administration officials yielded progress.\n\nSenate Democrats are expected to block an attempt by Republicans to take up a defense spending bill this week, as long as Republicans stick to their plan of delivering billions of dollars to Trump's border wall while shortchanging domestic programs.\n\nBut Shelby was optimistic that the House and Senate would make more headway on appropriations after the upper chamber passes a non-controversial package this week that would fund the departments of Agriculture, Justice, Commerce, Transportation and other agencies.\n\nWhen asked whether his staff received any indication that the White House might come down on their wall funding request, Shelby said, \u201cThat\u2019s a great question!\u201d\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, also said he thinks sentiment on Capitol Hill is improving.\n\n\u201cSen. Shelby and I have been working,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cWe even met in the gym this morning to work on it. So we\u2019re getting somewhere. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferris, Jennifer Scholtes and Caitlin Emma contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4d/a6/77003c244710ae9d8856656390c4/191030-pelosi-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
