Video Game\n\nPushing Sol Inherent in Phase 3 a.k.a. the Atheon Cheese\n\nAnother YouTuber \u2013 Cheese Forever \u2013 posted a video showing how to knock the Consecrated Mind off the map and eliminate it eventually. Also known as the \u201cAtheon cheese,\u201d the YouTuber claims that it happened by accident to several raiders and he was able to recreate the said trick with the help of a fellow Guardian.\n\nTo do this phase three trick, players need to choose the Hunter\u2019s top tree Nightstalker.\n\nBoth Gambler\u2019s Dodge and the Sixth Coyote Exotic chest armor are also optional. Next is to throw a smoke grenade in a certain hallway. If the Consecrated Mind turns its sights towards the smoke, the boss will likely to fall to his death. Cheese further explained that the reason behind it is that the boss could be treating the \u2018nade as an enemy and by the time the smoke is gone, it\u2019s bye-bye time for Sol.\n\nHe pointed out, however, that the cheese requires a bit of luck adding that the said boss does not go to that death trap that often. Cheese also said that players need to make it to the damage phase for the game to recognize that Sol has been eliminated.\n\n\u201cDestiny 2\u2019s\u201d Season of the Undying still has a very long way to go.
