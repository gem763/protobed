The singer was interviewed at LAX airport yesterday, the same day he and Cabello had a PDA-filled date out in the city. He was asked straight up whether his and Cabello's relationship was fake and just for PR. (The two started dating shortly after their single \"Se\u00f1orita\" came out, conveniently.)\n\n\"Look, one last thing, some people say that it\u2019s a publicity stunt, and you say?\" the paparazzo asked.\n\n\"We\u2019re definitely not a publicity stunt,\" Mendes replied.\n\nHe was also asked about that over-the-top makeout video they posted (\"It\u2019s a little bit of a joke, yeah\"), whether he's met Cabello's parents (\"Camila\u2019s parents I\u2019ve known for a long time\"), if they get along (\"yeah\") and if they've said \"I love you\" to each other (no response, understandably; that's personal).\n\nBut there you have it from the man himself: Stop saying Mendes and Cabello are fake; they're just two kids in love! On their Los Angeles date, things got a little quirky too. Mendes and Cabello were photographed holding hands and kissing at one point, as seen above. Mendes was in a blue t-shirt and black jeans, while Cabello was in a floral black dress.\n\nThen they went to a Halloween store, bought masks (hers was a unicorn and his appeared to be a baby mask), and walked out wearing them while paparazzi took photos and video of them. It was some real festive trolling...and coincidentally, a clever Halloween costume for anyone who wants to be Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello without paying for wigs.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The two had another PDA-filled date in Los Angeles yesterday.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/m7n54lFgD.KkoJfLNolULA--~B/aD0xMTA2O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/c5ca2f1dfe4adf2b091503f7becaec81", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
