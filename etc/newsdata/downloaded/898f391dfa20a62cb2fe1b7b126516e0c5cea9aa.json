A large number of U.K. lawmakers stand in his way.\n\nAfter years of posturing and weeks of positioning, British MPs are preparing to make their move Tuesday. The British prime minister is poised to counterattack on Wednesday.\n\nThis battle is the latest chapter in an ideological standoff that predates the June 2016 referendum as Britain wrestles with itself to define what kind of country it wants to be after breaking with its Continental neighbors. Whereas Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, was determined to navigate the storm without splitting the Conservative Party, Britain's new prime minister seems hell-bent on pushing to breaking point those who disagree with his belief that the electorate will not forgive the Tories if they fail to deliver Brexit in October.\n\nHere is POLITICO's guide to how events in Westminster could play out in the coming days.\n\nChange the law to force a delay\n\nMPs opposed to quitting the EU without a deal have put forward legislation to force the prime minister to ask for a three-month extension to negotiations if a deal is not agreed between the EU and the U.K. by October's European Council.\n\nMPs will on Tuesday apply to take control of the schedule of the House of Commons \u2014 usually set by the government \u2014 in a bid to turn the proposals in the private member's bill into law.\n\nHilary Benn, a senior Labour MP and one of those behind the plan, said it \"gave the government time either to reach a new agreement with the European Union at the European Council meeting next month, or to seek parliament\u2019s specific consent to leave the EU without a deal.\"\n\nIf neither condition has been met by October 19, the prime minister must send a letter to the president of the European Council requesting an extension to negotiations until January 31, 2020.\n\nThe prime minister would then be forced to immediately accept an extension until January 31, 2020 if the Council agrees to one or, should the Council propose a different date, accept that period within two days unless this plan is rejected by the House of Commons.\n\nFormer Tory ministers Alistair Burt, Philip Hammond and David Gauke have all put their names to the bill, demonstrating there is cross-party support \u2014 but is there enough?\n\nDo they have the numbers?\n\nIf the bill is to become law, there needs to be a majority of MPs willing to support it. That will rely on Conservatives defying party whips, and threats of deselection.\n\nDowning Street upped the ante Monday night, threatening rebellious Tory MPs with a general election on October 14 if they attempt to change the law to prevent the U.K. from leaving the European Union without a deal.\n\nBoris Johnson warned in a speech outside 10 Downing Street that such a bill would make negotiations \u201cabsolutely impossible.\u201d\n\nWhile the prime minister insisted he does not want to call a general election, senior officials later said that if it loses the vote on Tuesday, the government would push for one on October 14.\n\nA person close to the rebels said that while the numbers would be \"quite tight,\" they were \"quietly confident\" they had enough support in the House of Commons, despite the election threat.\n\nFormer Justice Secretary David Gauke had earlier told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show that he would be prepared to lose his job to block no deal. \"I have to put what I consider to be the national interest first,\" he said.\n\nBack to the people\n\nIf enough Tory rebels defy the government and allow parliament to take control of the schedule of the House of Commons \u2014 the first step in their bid to turn the plan to bind the prime minister's hands \u2014 the U.K. government will make its own countermove to trigger an election.\n\nUnder the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, passed in 2011 after the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government, British prime ministers are no longer able to unilaterally ask the queen to dissolve parliament and trigger an election. The prime minister must first secure backing for the poll from two-thirds of the MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThe government will put forward a motion requesting an early election if MPs do manage to start the process of legislating for an extension. This will be published in readiness on Tuesday and voted on the following day.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated on Monday he is likely to back the move, saying the U.K. \"needs\" a general election, which makes it seem likely any bid to hold an election would pass the House of Commons.\n\nElection blocked\n\nAn unlikely, but possible, scenario is that Johnson does not secure the two-thirds support he needs for an election at this point.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday warned a pre-Brexit election would be an \u201celephant trap\u201d for the Labour Party.\n\nTory MPs threatened with deselection and some rebel Labour MPs could block an election, but would be unlikely to succeed if both the Conservative and Labour Party leadership were whipping in favor of the move.\n\nIs there time?\n\nBut even if the prime minister is unsuccessful in his bid to call a general election, it remains uncertain whether the plan to pass a bill forcing an extension would have enough time to move through both houses of parliament and receive royal assent before Johnson suspends parliament for a month. That's a lot of legislative hoops to get through before next Monday, named by the government as the earliest possible date for suspension to begin.\n\n\"It\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s extremely tight,\" the Institute for Government's Hannah White told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. \"It\u2019s easier in the Commons than it is in the Lords. In the Commons you can do what\u2019s called programming legislation, which means you set out exactly how long there is to debate each stage.\"\n\nThe Lords is less certain. \"The Lords' procedure is much more flexible and there\u2019s been discussion about whether members of the House of Lords might try to prolong debate in order to prevent the legislation receiving royal assent before prorogation,\" White said.\n\nIgnore the law?\n\nIf the rebels manage to overcome all of these hurdles and get a new law onto the statute books, could Johnson simply ignore it?\n\nIn his statement in Downing Street Monday, Johnson said there would be \u201cno circumstances\u201d under which he would request a Brexit delay from Brussels.\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson insisted earlier Monday that \u201cevery government adheres to the law,\u201d but a government official explained that the prime minister's reaction would depend on exactly what the legislation said.\n\n\u201cThis lot do have a lot of form for bringing forward legislation which is defective,\" the official said. \"You cannot say we will abide by anything that they put forward as it may well be impossible.\"\n\nParliament traditionally defers to the executive on matters of foreign policy but, like much in the British system, the letter of the law is very much open to interpretation. Could parliament ask EU leaders directly for an extension rather than relying on Johnson to make the request?\n\n\"Lawyers would argue for a million years over that. Put five lawyers in a room and you get five answers,\" the official said.\n\nThe figure close to the rebels said the reason MPs felt they had to act now is because they believe they may have to take the government to court in this scenario \u2014 a move which could take at least three weeks. If they had waited until Johnson had a chance to renegotiate with the EU, they could risk running out of time and crashing out without a deal.\n\nWhoever comes out on top, time is in short supply.\n\nHYPOTHETICAL SECOND BREXIT REFERENDUM POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
