Under her leadership, the Department of Education has attempted to undermine debt forgiveness for public service workers, forced scammed students to pay back loans for worthless degrees, and, in a move that got her on the wrong side of a federal judge, garnished wages and seized tax returns of more than 1,800 former students.\n\nNow, DeVos's pro-usury agenda faces opposition from an unexpected source: A. Wayne Johnson, one of her own appointees. In 2017, DeVos named him chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid, meaning that he oversaw Americans' entire $1.5 trillion in student debt load, and after seven months, he became chief strategy and transformation officer. Before joining the administration, he worked in banking and started a private student loan firm in 2013, so on paper he seems unlikely to break with DeVos. His experience with the Department of Education changed that.\n\nJohnson is now resigning, according to the Wall Street Journal, and calling for mass student debt forgiveness. \"We run through the process of putting this debt burden on somebody\u2026but it rides on their credit files\u2014it rides on their back\u2014for decades,\" he told the Journal, adding, \"The time has come for us to end and stop the insanity.\"\n\nTo achieve this, Johnson proposes cancelling up to $50,000 for anyone with federal student-loan debt with a one percent tax on corporate earnings, which would total an estimated $925 billion and would fully wipe out the balances 37 million of the 44.7 million borrowers in the country. He also told the Journal that he's now considering a long-shot bid to replace Republican senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, who plans to retire this year.\n\nJohnson says that his firsthand experience looking at student debt trends convinced him that the current system is unsustainable and economically disastrous, and based on repayment trends he claims its unlikely that most of the $1.5 trillion will ever be repaid. The Trump administration has even taken the unusual step of hiring the consulting firm McKinsey to help assess whether or not to sell off some of the debt that the government owns. According to government data, 11 percent of borrowers default within three years of taking out a student loan, and unlike every single other form of debt, borrowers can't discharge student loan debt through bankruptcy.\n\nFighting the student debt crisis is a major issue among Democratic presidential candidates. Elizabeth Warren proposed a plan to cancel $50,000 in debt for every person making less than $100,000 a year, and Bernie Sanders also released a policy to wipe out all student debt with a tax on Wall Street. Even Ivanka Trump weighed in, suggesting that we just make student loans harder to get.\n\nA Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that 41 percent of Americans support \"immediately canceling and forgiving all current student-loan debt,\" though there was a sharp divide between likely Republican and Democratic voters. But one person adamantly opposed to debt forgiveness is DeVos herself. Talking to Fox News's Brett Baier last week, she dismissed Sanders's and Warren's plans as unrealistic.\n\n\"Their proposals are crazy,\" she told Baier. \"Who do they think is actually going to pay for these? It's going to be two of the three Americans that aren't going to college paying for the one out of three that do.\" That's standard misdirection conservatives use when talking about taxes though. In reality, Warren, Sanders, and even DeVos's now-former appointee are calling to forgive student debt using taxes on corporations and extremely high-income earners. In other words, the people paying for it would likely be in DeVos's tax bracket. Not that it should be too burdensome: Since billionaires are now paying a lower income tax than lower wage workers for the first time in history.", "description": "\u201cThis debt burden\u2026rides on their credit files\u2014it rides on their back\u2014for decades.\"", "authors": ["Luke Darby"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0_Gn8GoJS0fvgkDfFCWLEw--~B/aD0zMjkzO3c9NDkzOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gq_402/1b914e22dee089c16988bd5cb402ee84", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
