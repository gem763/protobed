Mr Tracey's former colleague on the Federal Court, Tony Pagone, is the new chairman.\n\nMr Pagone said his friend had \"a selfless drive and energy which he blended with good humour and compassion\".\n\n\"It is no small mark of the man's character that he worked solidly as a judge, despite at the time carrying an illness which might have crushed others until remission seemed to have lessened the danger.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he joined the Federal Court in 2006, Mr Tracey was counsel assisting the Cole royal commission into the construction industry and defended WorkChoices in the High Court.\n\nHe was also a former president of the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal and judge advocate-general of the Australian Defence Force. He served as a member of the ADF from 1975 to 2014, reaching the rank of Major-General.\n\nWhen he retired in August 2018, he told The Australian Financial Review that lawyers who pursued class action based on share price declines \"look like vultures\".\n\nMr Tracey said at the time that he looked forward to spending more time with his grandchildren and following the Collingwood AFL team, but had mixed feelings about forced retirement from the bench: \"I enjoy the work, but won't be saddened by the lifting of the burden of judgment writing.\"\n\n'Fair hearing'\n\nLaw Council president Arthur Moses, SC, described Mr Tracey as \u201ca man of the highest integrity\u201d.\n\nThe president of the Victorian Bar, Matt Collins, QC, said \"no litigant ever left his court without knowing they had had a fair hearing\".\n\n\"He was an inspired choice as the aged care royal commissioner. His passing is deeply felt by the whole of the legal profession but particularly members of the Victorian Bar. He was a mentor and exemplar to generations of barristers.\u201d\n\nFormer Federal Court judge Peter Heerey said Mr Tracey was \"always cheerful; always a most welcome addition to any group of friends\".\n\nWith AAP", "description": "Aged care royal commissioner Richard Tracey finished the interim report before his sudden death last week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7827%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_229%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a2a5605336307a5711420c443b8615fe7c6f010c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
