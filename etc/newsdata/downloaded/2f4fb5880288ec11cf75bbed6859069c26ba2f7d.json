Americans will have access to new training and education opportunities!\u201d\n\nEven though Google signed the pledge, the company is still a resolute opponent of limitations on immigration to protect American jobs, a key plank of President Trump\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nAs Breitbart\u2019s John Binder reported in 2017:\n\nThe parent company to Google, Alphabet, remains one of the largest opponents in the tech industry to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, which is why Quartz analysis showed it had the largest uptick in pro-immigration lobbying in the first quarter of 2017. In this quarter, alone, Alphabet lobbied more for immigration than ever before since 2008. In Alphabet\u2019s reports, according to Quartz analysis, executives used phrases like \u201ctravel ban\u201d and \u201ctravel restrictions\u201d in regard to Trump\u2019s national security executive order that would have prevented refugees from terrorist-haven nations from entering the U.S. Back in February, Google executives publicly opposed the travel ban, writing in a letter with other tech executives that the order \u201chinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace.\u201d\n\nGoogle is also one of the web\u2019s biggest censors. Breitbart News has exposed the company for manipulating political search results on YouTube to downrank conservative content, for pledging to make the populist movement a \u201cblip\u201d in history, and for \u201cThe Good Censor,\u201d an internal research document admitting the company has undergone a \u201cshift towards censorship.\u201d\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
