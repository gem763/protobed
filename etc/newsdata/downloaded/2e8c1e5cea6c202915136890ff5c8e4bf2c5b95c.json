We can build off our proposal in order to put a law in place that can actually stop the next attack.\n\nRed-flag laws empower law enforcement or family members to use the judicial system to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. In Florida, when a concerned family member contacts the police about a person determined to be a threat to himself or others, the police can petition a judge to have his guns taken away for two weeks. After an additional hearing, the risk protection order can be extended for up to a year.\n\nThe laws do not infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. In order for a state to be eligible for funding under our proposal, it would be required to enact strong due process protections and include a felony penalty for false reporting.\n\nRed and blue states alike across the country are enacting red-flag laws, and a recent study showed these laws may be playing a role in preventing mass shootings. As of last month, state judges had signed off on over 2,400 risk protections orders in Florida since March 2018, undoubtedly pre-empting violence.\n\nFar too often, we learn after a tragedy that the perpetrator displayed concerning and often repeated signs of deeply troubling behavior, including clear statements indicating their intent to cause harm to others. In the case of the Parkland shooting suspect, the police received at least 45 calls about him, and a woman close to him even communicated to the F.B.I. that she feared he would become a school shooter, listing specific examples of disturbing conduct \u2014 including holding a gun to the head of family members.", "description": "A red flag law will reduce bloodshed and respect the rights of gun owners.", "authors": ["Marco Rubio"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/opinion/12Rubio/12Rubio-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
