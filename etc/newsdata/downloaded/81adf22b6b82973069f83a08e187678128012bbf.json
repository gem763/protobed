The music trickled down from mountain folk carrying culture from their ancestral lands into the vast expanse of the new country. It rose up like a prayer from the slaves of the field tarrying thanklessly in a political system that traded them like chattel. It jolted cross-country on the backs of trains and took root in cities, where it nurtured business and flowed deeper into the country via radio towers. It told stories that hadn\u2019t been heard; it gave voice to the voiceless. In 16 painstaking hours, Ken Burns: Country Music traces the trek from old-time fiddlers and intrepid songcatchers to motion pictures and arena tours. What emerges is a history of American ingenuity, of enterprising thinkers paving ways where they hadn\u2019t yet existed.\n\nCountry Music\u2019s early hours are a dance between advances in tech and developments in culture. AM-radio stations sprouted across the country, providing hardworking families with a bit of respite from the souring economic prospects of the \u201930s. You begin to meet characters like Victor Talking Machine Company talent scout Ralph Peer and Atlanta-area performer Fiddlin\u2019 John Carson, who teamed up for the first commercial country recording. You revisit the fateful August 1927 sessions where Peer recorded the Mississippi yodeler Jimmie Rodgers and the husband, wife, and sister act that would come to be known as country music\u2019s first family, the Carters. Rodgers sang of hustlers and gamblers in tunes like \u201cBlue Yodel No. 9 (Standin\u2019 on the Corner)\u201d and \u201cIn the Jailhouse Now\u201d; the Carters addressed matters of the heart and spirit in \u201cThe Church in the Wildwood\u201d and \u201cThe Storms Are on the Ocean.\u201d\n\nBurns illustrates a duality here that sticks for the remainder of the film, a tug-of-war between Saturday night and Sunday morning, between barstool and church pew. The push and pull between Rodgers\u2019s rough living and the Carters\u2019s Christian sensibilities are mirrored later on in the music of Hank Williams, the hard-drinking Alabama \u201cHillbilly Shakespeare\u201d who devised an alter ego, Luke the Drifter, to sing gospel numbers like \u201cI Saw the Light,\u201d and in Johnny Cash, the Carter-family scion through marriage who sang hymns and also performed in prisons, having had experiences of both as he bounced from amphetamine dependency to redemption. Cash is Burns\u2019s through line from the Carter family to Sun Records\u2019 rockabilly hits of the \u201950s, dalliances with folk and rock in the late \u201960s, and the emergence of Americana in the \u201980s and \u201990s. He brings Elvis and Bob Dylan into the fold early on and inspires a love of the classic country songbook in his daughter, Rosanne, who added her own twist in the \u201980s and beyond.\n\nAlong the way, Country Music tells the story of the invention of the music business as we now know it, and the innovations and oversights that came with it. Restless sons and daughters of farmers, oil-rig workers, and brakemen learned how to package and sell their pain, and enterprising businesspeople were born. Singing cowboys like Gene Autry made a mint on motion pictures and promotional products carrying their names. (The most lurid side hustle is Louisiana singer Webb Pierce\u2019s stint selling dollar Mason jars of water from the guitar-shaped swimming pool at his Nashville home, which fans also paid money to visit.) Radio stations developed barn-dance shows to open up live events and break talented performers to larger audiences as clear-channel stations began to broadcast signals from coast to coast.\n\nThese developments dovetailed in the birth of the Grand Ole Opry, a weekly variety show transmitted out of Nashville\u2019s Ryman Auditorium, the \u201cMother Church of Country Music.\u201d The Opry was, and is, a strong defender of country music and culture and a potentially forbidding venue for artists too far left of the dial. The Opry boosted the careers of legends like Bill Monroe and Roy Acuff, but its partiality toward clean-cut, wholesome talent made it hesitant to invite Hank Williams at his peak, resistant to Elvis\u2019s rock-and-roll revolution, and obstinate in the face of \u201960s advances in country-rock. The disastrous response to the Byrds in their first and only Opry gig (which telegraphed radio\u2019s rejection of the band\u2019s 1968 classic Sweetheart of the Rodeo) sticks out among missed opportunities for the organization to adapt to the times.\n\nCountry Music uses the Opry to strike a balance between purity and progression and also to dramatize the public\u2019s jibing tastes in artifice and authenticity. The great Tennessee humorist Minnie Pearl was a college grad doing respectful satire of southern culture in the same way that performers from the Dust Bowl days to the Hee Haw era used fashion to appeal to working-class audiences. People craved realism, but they wanted showmanship too. (This is how we get big hair and Nudie suits, how folksy acoustic performances evolve into shiny stadium spectacles.) Strike the right balance between the two and the audience might love you forever. Deviate from the script and you were on your own. A poignant example of great risks and edifying rewards from the later stretches of the doc is Columbia\u2019s initial reluctance to put out Willie Nelson\u2019s 1975 high-water mark Red Headed Stranger because suits thought it unfinished. Talent won for Willie; the label released Stranger to appease him and was surprised by its critical and commercial success. But many country artists suffered for differing from the norm.\n\nThe documentary\u2019s musings on race and gender examine the shortcomings of conservatism as a tentpole in the arts. Many of the great white male singer-songwriters through country history cop to having been inspired by black performers, who could never enjoy the same shine. Mississippi singer-songwriter and mandolin whiz Marty Stuart states it eloquently: \u201cIf you took Mr. Lesley Riddle out of the A. P. Carter equation as a songcatcher and a song gatherer, if you took Arnold Shultz out of Bill Monroe\u2019s life, or if you took [Rufus] \u2018Tee Tot\u2019 [Payne] out of Hank Williams\u2019s life, just those three alone, look how differently it would turn out.\u201d Texas country-and-folk genius Townes Van Zandt caught the spark listening to Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins. Johnny Cash\u2019s muse was bluesman Gus Cannon. Contrast this adoration across lines of race with the story of DeFord Bailey, the black harmonica and guitar player whose performing career ended when he was ousted unceremoniously from the Opry in 1941, or the stunned silence at the sight of the first public Charley Pride gig, in which people had to confront the reality that the voice on some of their favorite songs belonged to a black man. A report from Hank Williams\u2019s funeral mentioning 200 black fans in the segregated seats is the rare acknowledgment of the true diversity of the listening audience.\n\nCountry Music explores women\u2019s struggles too, but it treads very lightly. Sarah and A. P. Carter\u2019s keeping their split a secret for years is understood to have been a career necessity. The flap over Loretta Lynn\u2019s feminist anthem \u201cThe Pill,\u201d which became a hit in spite of label delays and radio bans, is seen in the context of an industry still working its way up to the idea of women in positions of power. In these areas, Country Music lets the viewer draw the obvious conclusions. It\u2019s honest but never judgmental. It prefers to celebrate the strength of the network of southern mothers who steered the ship than to take down the men limiting their career prospects. To that end, Burns lionizes characters like Mother Maybelle Carter, country-guitar innovator and adviser to anyone who needed a talking-to over a good meal, and Lillie Williams, mother of Hank, who is remembered as a reliable partner in a barroom brawl. Country isn\u2019t the most provocative of Burns\u2019s recent work; a year after the prescient vision of war and civil unrest painted in 2017\u2019s The Vietnam War, this gallery of poets, loners, and businessmen feels romantic in comparison.\n\nYou can\u2019t tell the story of the roots music issuing out of Nashville, Texas, California, Kentucky, and parts beyond without romance and characters, though. Country Music is perhaps best enjoyed as a stream of singers and songwriters extolling the virtues of the craft. The cast of characters is astounding \u2014 it\u2019s full of voices you wouldn\u2019t expect to hear, like the late Merle Haggard. There\u2019s brilliant industry women, like the singer Brenda Lee, or the writer Hazel Smith, who first coined the term \u201coutlaw country.\u201d Marty Stuart lends Burns his encyclopedic knowledge of music history and his lightning-fast fretwork (and, in an upset, edges Dolly out for best hair and wardrobe with his gothic threads and silver mane). The lifers are a riot. Western swing singer Ray Benson of Asleep at the Wheel captures the spirit of the Austin scene of the \u201970s in a single sentence: \u201cRent was $100, and pot was cheap.\u201d Neo-traditionalist songwriting hawks like Vince Gill and Dwight Yoakam work hard to find words to describe their love of a song or turn of phrase.\n\nKen Burns: Country Music carries something for fans at every level of their journey with country and western music. If you\u2019re new to the stuff, you get an exhaustive primer on all of the tributaries flowing into and out of the culture. If you\u2019re the type who only digs the outlaw era, stick it out for the \u201950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s sections, and lively origin stories like the account of the inquisitive Columbia Studios janitor who turned out to be Kris Kristofferson. If you\u2019re up on all the pertinent historical developments, you get to see legends gush over each other\u2019s achievements and enjoy interviews with a number of figureheads who\u2019ve passed on in the last five years. The greatest compliment you could pay an undertaking like this is to wish there were more of it. One wonders what Burns would make of cowpunk and alt-country or southern rock or progressive bluegrass, styles that Country Music glosses over in favor of extensive profiles of titans and kingmakers. It\u2019s gratifying, illuminating television regardless.", "description": "Ken Burns: Country Music carries something for fans at every level of their journey with country and Western music.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/17/17-country-music.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
