(Photo: Gordon Donovan/Yahoo News)\n\nEach August and September, as summer fades into fall, Yahoo News photographer Gordon Donovan finds himself in a familiar spot \u2014 snapping images in the area where the 9/11 terrorist attacks took place.\n\n\u201cI do it because I love the city, the history of the city and how we\u2019re not going to be put down,\u201d explained Donovan, who was born and raised on Staten Island and watched the twin towers being built from across the harbor.\n\nBut his photos aren\u2019t random shots of the evolving downtown landscape. He returns to document the exact scenes of many memorable images taken by photojournalists that awful day in 2001.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to see how it has changed over the years, because it was just this big pile of rubble the first time I went down there, about a week afterward,\u201d said Donovan, then a graphic artist at CBS News, who was at work on the Upper West Side the morning of the attack.\n\nToday a memorial and museum honor the nearly 3,000 people killed. The area also includes a recently opened transportation hub, and there are other signs of development yet to come.\n\n\u201cNow you can\u2019t even recognize what happened,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done down there is beautiful and just revitalized the whole area after such tragedy and brought it back to life.\u201d\n\nDonovan\u2019s then-and-now project, he said, is a testament to the city\u2019s strength and an opportunity to share the changes with New Yorkers who may have moved away over the past 18 years. He said his project also honors the photojournalists who took the original images on 9/11.\n\nNew obstacles have arisen, requiring some adjustments in camera angles to align with the original images. This is the eighth time Donovan has revisited the New York skyline to document changes since 9/11; each year presents new challenges as the New York City landscape changes.\n\nSee more news-related photo galleries and follow us on Yahoo News Photo Twitter and Tumblr.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrag the slider across each pair of images to see changes in the New York City landscape.\n\nLooking downtown from the \u2018Top of the Rock\u2019\n\n2001: The twin towers of the World Trade Center burn behind the Empire State Building, Sept. 11, 2001.
