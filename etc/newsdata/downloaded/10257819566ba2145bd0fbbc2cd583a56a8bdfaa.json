'But events outside our control put our relationship under huge strain. I have come to realise it's best we stay just friends.\n\n'The last few months have been like a soap opera. Lizzie and I have been the innocent victim of some wild and false accusations. Life with Lizzie is tremendous fun...\n\n'We got on really well from the word go. We didn't stop laughing for weeks.

I don\u2019t normally swear but I couldn\u2019t help myself. I shouted, \"You f***ing whore!\".'\n\nClearly heartbroken, Candice claimed Gordeno had revealed he wanted to start a family with her.\n\nGordeno said: 'I will always be very fond of Lizzie. But events outside our control put our relationship under huge strain and it's best we stay friends'\n\nThey have been a couple since 2016 but friends of the tycoon say he broke off the relationship before romancing Cundy.\n\nAfter the nightclub owner proposed in Italy, she revealed she had made the shocking discovery of his romance with Lizzie.\n\nShe said: 'I felt everything crumble around me. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing and I couldn\u2019t believe he was telling me to leave and not her. We have been through so much together.\n\n'I was crying. I said to him, \u2018Three years and you treat me like this for her?\u2019 As I was leaving I said, \u2018He asked me to marry me, we have been looking for rings, why have you done this?\u2019.'\n\nFrancesca and Gordeno have not responded to requests for a comment.", "description": "Lizzie Cundy was left heartbroken after splitting from her boyfriend Jeremy Gordeno, 53, amid claims he developed a close friendship with his former fianc\u00e9e's 21-year-old daughter.", "authors": ["Kate Thomas For Mailonline", "Paul Thompson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/10/19780070-0-image-a-16_1571217534979.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
