But as he gets up to leave at the end of our interview, I want to be sure I heard him correctly that he will not endorse any candidate in any race between now and November 2020. \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe only asterisk I\u2019d put on that is the socialism point I\u2019m making,\u201d Sasse adds. He begins talking about how Omaha\u2019s Republican congressman, Don Bacon, is running against an \u201cactual socialist\u201d and he\u2019ll be helping Bacon\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running against the Democrats\u2019 crazy turn toward socialism. But, as a matter of formal endorsements\u2014I mean, I\u2019m working to support the Republican ticket, period. But I\u2019m not endorsing candidates in individual races.\u201d\n\nWait, Sasse is supporting but not endorsing candidates?\n\nDoes supporting the Republican ticket mean supporting Trump in 2020? \u201cAll of the turn toward socialism is disastrous,\u201d Sasse replies.\n\nSo does Sasse support Trump-Pence in 2020?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting the Republican ticket.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Nationalreview.Com What-Is-Ben-Sasse-Thinking"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
