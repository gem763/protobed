But if history is any indication, there may be more pain ahead for stocks in September. Since 1950, September has been the worst month for the S&P 500 with an average decline of 0.5% during the month, according to LPL Financial. \u201cAugust was a burst of volatility for most investors, and we expect that to continue in September,\u201d LPL Financial\u2019s Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick noted in an email to Yahoo Finance. \u201cBut if you\u2019re looking for some good news, the past 15 times stocks were lower in August, the rest of the year was actually higher every single time.\u201d\n\nThe volatility in August was largely due to recession fears and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, and the trade tensions are showing no signs of cooling off. Investors are antsy, and the implied open on Tuesday is an indication that the trade war will continue to have a meaningful impact on the markets so long as the two nations fail to reach some sort of agreement.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz More\n\nTrade war rages on\n\nSunday, the U.S. went forward with its tariffs on more Chinese goods, and this time, the U.S. consumer is likely to start feeling the heat directly. President Donald Trump took to Twitter Tuesday morning to express his view on the current status of trade war negotiations with China.\n\nWe are doing very well in our negotiations with China. While I am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of \u201cripoff USA\u201d($600 B/year),16 months PLUS is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long-shot.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2019\n\n....And then, think what happens to China when I win. Deal would get MUCH TOUGHER! In the meantime, China\u2019s Supply Chain will crumble and businesses, jobs and money will be gone! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2019\n\nAccording to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, since Trump took office in 2016, when Trump\u2019s Twitter activity spikes, it\u2019s not so good for the market. \u201cTrade talk, political campaigning and tweets have contributed to volatility, from China to Fed policy to tax policy. Since 2016, days with more than 35 tweets (90th percentile) by President Trump have seen negative returns (-9bp), whereas days with less than 5 tweets (10th percentile) have seen positive returns (+5bp) - statistically significant,\u201d the bank wrote in a note Tuesday.\n\nNevertheless, while the trade war weighs on the markets, some economists argue that the trade war has not had a real impact on the economy. \u201cThe trade dispute with China may be escalating at a rapid pace but, despite the concerns of Fed officials, there is still little evidence that this is having a significant impact on the economy,\u201d Capital Economics wrote in a note Friday.\n\nEconomy: U.S. manufacturing sector contracts for first time in 3 years\n\nNew data released Tuesday morning revealed more trouble in the U.S. manufacturing sector. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s purchasing manager\u2019s index (PMI) fell to 49.1 in August to its lowest level since January 2016. Readings above 50 imply expansion, while below 50 indicates contraction. The latest data illustrates the negative impact that slowing global growth and the ongoing trade war are having on U.S. producers. ISM\u2019s new orders fell to 47.2, which was the first time that the gauge fell below 50 since December 2015.\n\n\u201cWhile slower global growth has been the main headwind facing US manufacturers over the past 12 months, the press release highlighted that the renewed escalation of trade tensions with China is starting to weigh more heavily on sentiment,\u201d Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. \u201cThat will only reinforce the concerns of Fed officials over the impact of trade uncertainty on the economy, and provides another reason to think that another 25bp rate cut is coming at the FOMC meeting in two weeks\u2019 time.\u201d", "description": "Dow tumbles more than 300 points to kick off the shortened trading week.", "authors": ["Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H9j.kfekvAI_2e6rapCsLQ--~B/aD0yNzMwO3c9NDA5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/6863cd90-be90-11e9-bfcf-d70cefbc1ed1"}
