My utility charges almost as much for their fixed costs (pay roll, maintenance...etc) as my actual electricity cost. If demand for electricity outpaces supply the prices will skyrocket and of course families need basic electricity just to live and heat their homes. Plus most State road taxes are derived from gasoline sales and the last thing a person needs is their taxes going up when maybe they are also using fossil fuels because the lack of plugins where parking is available.
