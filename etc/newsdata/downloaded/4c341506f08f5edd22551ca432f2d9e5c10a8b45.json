(Kieun Kim/Korean Cultural Center)\n\nFor three South Korean women making art in the United States, being connected means retaining ties to their families and their culture. But more literal sorts of links also figure in \u201cNewly Connected,\u201d a show of video, photography, sculpture and painting at the Korean Cultural Center.\n\nOne of the center\u2019s two galleries has been laced with white strands by Kieun Kim, who supplements the spidery installation with ambient music and kaleidoscopic lights. The enticing web was designed in part for a performance in which Kim acts out her search for identity and purpose. Even when the performer is not there, though, her existence is strongly indicated by the objects holding the cords in place: wall-mounted wooden mannequin hands.\n\nStones and songs attach Kyoung eun Kang to Korea, specifically to her parents. In a video, the artist laboriously navigates a New York City sidewalk, balancing upon rocks sent from her homeland by her mother. She also photographed her parents as they held stones in front of their faces, and she videotaped them separately as they sang traditional Korean laments. The video locations are two different lighthouses, navigational aids that here offer a sense of loss.\n\nIn paintings supplemented by ceramic orbs, Namwon Choi renders postcard views of scenic byways. Such scenes are not quite universal, but they can be seen anywhere trees grow alongside modern, auto-oriented thoroughfares. The pictures are incorporated into tidy, larger compositions of narrow lines and thick bars, a sort of hard-edge geometric imagery that\u2019s also common throughout the industrialized world. What ties the work to traditional culture is the austere color scheme: blue and white, common in Asian pottery. Choi connects the new to an art form that was old when the first Model T chugged off the assembly line.\n\nNewly Connected Through Sept. 27 at the Korean Cultural Center, 2370 Massachusetts Ave. NW.\n\n\n\n\u201cBirds Are Bridges\u201d by Amy Guadagnoli. (Amy Guadagnoli/Greg Staley)\n\nAmy Guadagnoli\n\nWoodblock printing is a millennia-old process, used widely but associated notably with Japan in the 1603-1868 Edo period. Amy Guadagnoli doesn\u2019t explicitly emulate that era\u2019s printmaking, but there are aspects of her style that recall it. Most of the works in \u201cCutting Through,\u201d the artist\u2019s Washington Printmakers Gallery show, are on mulberry paper, a traditional Japanese medium. Patterns she incises into areas of flat color suggest decorative motifs seen on kimonos. And Guadagnoli conceives her images as \u201cin the spirit of Buddhist koans,\u201d according to her statement.\n\nYet these dynamically composed, splendidly colorful pictures differ from their Japanese precursors in significant ways. Unlike Edo-period prints, they don\u2019t depict the known world. They\u2019re abstract, with mere hints of landscape in vista-implying horizontals and treelike verticals. Also, Guadagnoli often prints from the same hand-carved block, recutting it between each impression of an additional color. This approach, known as reduction printing, yields pieces that are unique and irreproducible, not mass-produced.\n\nThe show\u2019s title, Guadagnoli explains, is both literal and metaphorical: She wants to slice through the viewer\u2019s everyday perceptions. In the print \u201cKeel,\u201d one of the show\u2019s standouts, the forms and spaces hewed by her blade play eloquently against each other. The black vertical at the center is framed by what appear to be gashes of white \u2014 unprinted paper that\u2019s as forceful as the inked areas. It\u2019s a strategy worthy of an Edo-period virtuoso.\n\nAmy Guadagnoli: Cutting Through Through Sept. 29 at Washington Printmakers Gallery, 1641 Wisconsin Ave. NW.\n\n\n\nZofie King's exhibition \u201cSecular Relics and Apocryphal Fossils\u201d is at Hillyer. (Zofie King/International Arts & Artists at Hillyer)\n\nZofie King\n\nThe curiosity cabinet \u2014 or \u201cwunderkammer\u201d in Zofie King\u2019s native Germany \u2014 was a place for wealthy, educated people to keep scientific specimens, holy mementos and small artworks. Such cabinets have lost their usefulness since they originated about 400 years ago, but for King they still have a purpose. Her show at IA&A at Hillyer, \u201cSecular Relics and Apocryphal Fossils,\u201d combines real and fake to spark reflection on what we believe and why.\n\nSince it\u2019s a compendium of found and invented objects, the Arlington artist\u2019s show can be seen as a big brain. It\u2019s stuffed with information that ranges from meaningful to worthless. The brain metaphor also suggests itself because models of the human cerebrum abound: A translucent yellow-resin one glows at the center of one assemblage, while a flock of mini-brains molded from pages of 19th-century Bibles hangs from the ceiling in another construction.\n\nThe cabinets hold minerals, fabric, bullet shells and fur, both synthetic and genuine. But religion seems to be King\u2019s principal interest. A banner on the wall reads, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Is this the word of a god, rebuking those who play loose with scripture? What some take as absolute truth, King suggests, is merely an accumulation of symbols and suppositions.\n\nZofie King: Secular Relics and Apocryphal Fossils Through Sept. 29 at IA&A at Hillyer, 9 Hillyer Ct. NW.\n\nThe Trawick Prize\n\nThere are no traditional portraits among the work by the eight finalists for this year\u2019s Trawick Prize, on exhibit at Gallery B, but a human presence is suggested in effective ways. Among the most powerful submissions from the Maryland, Virginia and D.C. entrants is a life-size silhouette of a crouching man on the side of a wooden crate, one of two pieces that won Oletha DeVane the $10,000 top prize. The painted container memorializes Henry \u201cBox\u201d Brown, an enslaved man who escaped Virginia in 1849 by having himself shipped to Philadelphia.\n\nSecond-place winner Mojdeh Rezaeipour evokes family and Iranian American identity primarily with artifacts, supplemented by small paintings. Renee Rendine took third place by erecting a field of yellow-plastic lattices under a white-mesh funnel for a performance, which can be seen on video.\n\nThe young-artist award went to Monroe Isenberg for a brawny construction: a stump-like wooden sculpture that seemingly teeters in space, held up by a cable. The feeling of tension that makes the piece so vital is echoed in a large, off-kilter ceramic sculpture by Anne Clare Rogers. Both Isenberg and Rogers abstract the natural world while retaining a trace of its actual power.\n\nThe Trawick Prize: Bethesda Contemporary Art Awards Through Sept. 28 at Gallery B, 7700 Wisconsin Ave., #E, Bethesda.", "description": "Three artists are featured in the \u201cNewly Connected\u201d exhibition.", "authors": ["Mark Jenkins", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sqCBHlhIilsQ9w_pyPOiW0Xu0cA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2C2KTNGYVAI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
