(MSFT.O) has won the Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion (\u00a37.80 billion) cloud computing contract, the Defense Department said on Friday, beating out favorite Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Microsoft sign is shown on top of the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19,2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract is part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon meant to make it more technologically agile.\n\nBut the contracting process had long been mired in conflict of interest allegations, even drawing the attention of President Donald Trump, who has publicly taken swipes at Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nOracle Corp (ORCL.N) had expressed concerns about the award process for the contract, including the role of a former Amazon employee who worked on the project at the Defense Department but recused himself, then later left the Defense Department and returned to Amazon Web Services.\n\nSome companies were also concerned that a single award would give the winner an unfair advantage in follow-on work. The Pentagon has said it planned to award future cloud deals to multiple contractors.\n\nThen this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing the deal due to his adult son\u2019s employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM Corp (IBM.N). IBM had previously bid for the contract but had already been eliminated from the competition.\n\nIn a statement announcing Microsoft as the winner, the Pentagon underscored its view that the competition was conducted fairly and legally.\n\n\u201cAll (offers) were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation\u2019s stated evaluation criteria. Prior to the award, the department conferred with the DOD Inspector General, which informed the decision to proceed,\u201d it said.\n\nIn a statement, an Amazon Web Services spokesman said the company was \u201csurprised about this conclusion.\u201d The company said that a \u201cdetailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings\u201d would \u201cclearly lead to a different conclusion,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nMicrosoft shares were up 2.5% to $144.35 in after-hours trading after the news. Amazon shares were down 0.98% to $1,744.12.\n\nThe Pentagon said it had awarded more than $11 billion across 10 separate cloud contracts over the past two years.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to execute the DOD Cloud Strategy, additional contracts are planned for both cloud services and complementary migration and integration solutions necessary to achieve effective cloud adoption,\u201d the Pentagon said.", "description": "Microsoft Corp. has won the Pentagon's $10 billion (\u00a37.80 billion) cloud computing contract, the Defense Department said on Friday, beating out favorite Amazon.com Inc .", "authors": ["Phil Stewart", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1445023495&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1V0", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
