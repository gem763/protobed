What If the Philippines Became Russia's Ally?", "language": "en", "text": "Key point: Manila is interested in Moscow's airplanes.\n\nWhy is the Philippines suddenly interested in buying Russian aircraft?\n\nNot warplanes, but civilian planes for commercial purposes. Yet it suggests that Manila is eyeing a closer relationship with Moscow.\n\n\u201cThere is an intention for finding Philippine partners that would probably bring in Russian jets into the country that could be used for tourism or disaster relief,\u201d said Corazon Halili-Dichosa, executive director of the Philippine Board of Investments Industry Development Services, according to Russia\u2019s Sputnik News. \u201cModels that are being offered right now are Sukhoi, Be-200 and MS-21.\u201d\n\n\"We think maybe the start for the Russian companies would be general aviation rather than the big commercial things, because the two [Philippine] air companies are right now [using] more Airbus and Boeing, but the general aviation is more open for other brands,\u201d said Halili-Dichosa, who suggested that Russian-made aircraft could be used for charter flights between the numerous islands that comprise the Philippines.\n\nThis might seem just a minor commercial aviation deal. But what\u2019s interesting is that the story ran in the defense section of Sputnik News, which hints that the Russian government\u2014and cash-strapped Russian aircraft manufacturers\u2014may be hoping to score some military contracts.\n\nIndeed, Manila seems to be drawing closer to Moscow even as its relations with Washington have worsened. In March 2019, Russian and Philippine officials met to discuss a potential naval pact. In April, two Russian warships docked in Manila. The port visit included \u201cjoint drills on navigation and communication as well as special trainings with the quick response forces of the Philippines,\u201d according to the Philippine government. It was the sixth visit of Russian warships, which was reciprocated by the first-ever Philippine Navy ship that sailed to Vladivostok in July for a naval parade marking Russian Navy Day.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "How could that happen?", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.ggng3TmjWqJm2J6jiidmA--~B/aD05MDI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/46093a8e135db5674bdc92fbafdd0682", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
