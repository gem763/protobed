The Conservatives can\u2019t deliver Brexit on their own. https://t.co/3AxjVpiulP \u2014 Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) October 25, 2019\n\nMr Johnson had frequently said he would ensure an October 31st Brexit day \u201cdo or die\u201d during his campaign to become the party leader and since as prime minister, and even said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than renege on the promise.\n\nBeyond blaming Parliament and Jeremy Corbyn for the delay, it is not clear how Mr Johnson will manage climbing down from his position, now that events forced by anti-Brexit campaigners have bound his hands.\n\nMaking the case for the government and defending its record of attempting to deliver Brexit on time on Friday, Sajid Javid told BBC Breakfast presenter Charlie Stayt that: \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything possible to leave on October 31st.\n\n\u201cWe got that deal that everyone said that we couldn\u2019t get, we\u2019ve planned extremely carefully for a no-deal outcome just in case. But because of the actions of Parliament and especially of Jeremy Corbyn, we\u2019ve had more dither and more delay. And now we have to accept we won\u2019t be able to leave on October 31st because Parliament has requested an extension.\n\n\u2018Brexit in 99 Days, No Ifs, No Buts\u2019: Boris Johnson Makes First Speech as UK Prime Minister https://t.co/QGDx5WxkTl \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 24, 2019\n\n\u201cAnd although we haven\u2019t heard back from the EU yet, it is likely, we just have to assume that they will agree to Parliament\u2019s request. Not something we wanted, but they will agree and probably offer a three-month extension.\u201d\n\nAsked to confirm that he was indeed revealing that the October 31st deadline had been officially dropped by government, Mr Javid continued: \u201cIt can\u2019t be met because Parliament has asked for an extension\u2026 everyone expects an extension [from the EU] and when that happens we won\u2019t be able to leave on the 31st.\u201d\n\nEver critical of the Conservative Party\u2019s clinging to the hope of a good deal while failing to deliver one, Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party leapt on the revelation, pointing to the powerlessness of Boris Johnson and his government.\n\nIn a statement seen by Breitbart London, party chairman Richard Tice said in response on Friday: \u201cThe government has finally admitted what The Brexit Party has said all along: The Tories alone are powerless to deliver Brexit on October 31st.\n\n\u201cThis morning, the Chancellor said we \u2018have to accept\u2019 Brexit has been blocked again and the EU will \u2018probably offer a three-month extension,\u2019 chaining us to Brussels into the New Year. The Tory Party is struggling to get anything past Parliament and the Remain establishment, partly because so many within their own ranks are in the Remain establishment.\u201d\n\n\u2018Do or Die\u2019: Boris Won\u2019t Win Election Unless He Delivers Brexit on Time https://t.co/qwitR6uVmy \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2019\n\nThe Brexit Party has held out a hand of friendship to the Conservatives in the past, claiming that campaigning together on a full-Brexit ticket \u2014 a withdrawal without a deal and without remaining tied to the European Union \u2014 would bring a landslide and pro-Brexit control of Parliament. The Conservatives have rejected the offers with contempt so far.\n\nRiffing on this theme, Tice continued: \u201cThe Brexit Party has offered to put country before party and work with fellow, committed Brexiteers to secure a proper Brexit.\n\n\u201cOnly a Clean-Break Brexit will fully protect the independence of Britain\u2019s fishing, defence, and trade, and the integrity of our precious Union, which the current Treaty sells out\u2026 We will be paying tens of billions a year to be effectively locked in the EU, with no voice, no veto, and no vote.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s sack this unrepresentative, zombie parliament squatting in the Palace of Westminster, form an unstoppable Leave alliance, and get a proper, better Brexit done.\u201d\n\nFarage Expresses Hope Tories Will Deliver Clean Brexit, But Boris Rules Out No Deal Election Platform https://t.co/UQx7ZyadAJ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 10, 2019\n\nMr Johnson has already attempted to call a general election twice \u2014 in normal times, a standard response to a government being unable to govern \u2014 but a new law passed by David Cameron has given opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn the power to block a fresh vote. While Mr Corbyn has made much of his desire to enter into fresh elections, he has twice turned down the opportunity \u2014 a first in British political history \u2014 because he objects to a potential pro-Brexit government being a potential outcome of the vote.\n\nThe Labour leader has said he would only agree to elections once \u201cno-deal Brexit is taken off the table\u201d, in a remarkable attack on democracy demanding that potential election results distasteful to him be banned before the vote even takes place.\n\nThe government is to make another attempt to break the stalemate by calling for fresh elections on Monday with the intended date of December 12th. Labour will likely again move to block, keeping Britain in Brexit limbo \u2014 and hence inside the European Union \u2014 for as long as possible.", "description": "The UK \"won't be able to leave on October 31st\" because of \"the actions of Parliament and especially Jeremy Corbyn\", Sajid Javid said.", "authors": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1177995932-e1572007490923-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
