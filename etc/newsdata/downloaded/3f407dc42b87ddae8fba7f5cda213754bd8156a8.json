The money will be used, in part, to finance its launch in the United States.\n\nCEO Guillaume Lacroix said that that he and his co-founders all come from the French TV industry, where they were all \u201cfrustrated not to be able to follow up the conversation\u201d on social media. So they created Brut as a way deliver video news that felt conversational and authentic, hoping to spark viewer conversation, then take advantage of that commentary to find future stories.\n\n\u201cWe always always say to journalists, \u2018Forget the audience, think about your two best friends,'\u201d Lacroix told me. \u201c\u2018Would you be excited to have this conversation tonight with your friends? If yes, let\u2019s do it.'\u201d\n\nThe publisher focuses on topics like social good and social impact \u2014 for example, it published the first viral video featuring climate change activist Greta Thunberg. Lacroix argued that Brut\u2019s audience is looking for solutions, not just problems, in contrast to the \u201cnegative news cycle\u201d that they see on traditional media.\n\n\u201cPeople are not waiting anymore \u2014 they don\u2019t wait for institutions to do it, they don\u2019t wait for the collectivity to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very inspiring to see someone who takes even a small action.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he doesn\u2019t want Brut\u2019s journalists to veer too heavily into advocacy or activism themselves: \u201cWe don\u2019t do a call to action, we\u2019re not activists, we don\u2019t point a finger. We just shine a light on people who are trying to do something to change the world.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Brut seems to check off the same boxes (it aims to reach a millennial/Gen Z audience with short videos on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat) that many U.S. digital media startups did before they started to struggle and consolidate over the past few years.\n\nBut Lacroix said the startup\u2019s approach is working \u2014 not just in terms of reaching an audience, but also building a real business. Brut is already profitable in France, and it plans to be profitable in the U.S. within three years.\n\nAsked whether he\u2019s worried about relying on social platforms to reach his audience, Lacroix argued that even if you focus on publishing on your own website, you\u2019re reliant on Google for traffic.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s not a problem of distribution, if you\u2019re diversified enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem of: What\u2019s your business model? Why did Spotify explode from day one? They have a global DNA. It\u2019s exactly the same for us.\u201d\n\nFor example, Lacroix said that Brut\u2019s audience is concerned about many of the same issues no matter what country they\u2019re in. And the company is able to produce content for them in a relatively low cost way, because it can shoot a video in French or English, then add subtitles in a variety of languages \u2014 most audiences won\u2019t even notice since they\u2019re watching on their phones, with the sound off.\n\nTo be clear, Brut hasn\u2019t exactly been ignoring the U.S. market before this. The company said it has an audience of 30 million daily active viewers across the globe, including in the United States, and it opened an office in New York City a couple of years ago. By \u201claunching\u201d here, Brut means it\u2019s hiring an advertising salesforce to start monetizing that audience.\n\nThe company previously raised 10 million euros (approximately $11.1 million) from Kima Ventures, according to Crunchbase. The new funding was led by Red River West and blisce, with participation from Aryeh Bourkoff, Eric Zinterhofer and others.\n\n\u201cWhen deciding where to invest, we look for mission-driven companies whose values are aligned with our own,\u201d said blisce founder and CEO Alexandre Mars in a statement. \u201cLike blisce\u2019s previous investments in Spotify, Pinterest and Bird, we believe that Brut.\u2019s unique global approach represents a special competitive advantage, as well as an understanding that business success and positive social impact are inextricably linked.\u201d", "description": "Digital media startup Brut is announcing that it has raised $40 million in Series B funding.
