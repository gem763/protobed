When there is peace you are playing here and when we are in trouble you not here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe tried to be patient. But if this is going to undermine the peace and existence of Ethiopia, whether you speak Amharic or Oromiffa, we will take measures. You can\u2019t play both ways.\u201d\n\nAmharic and Oromiffa are the languages of the country\u2019s largest ethnic groups.\n\nJawar, who promotes non-violent activism and an \u201cOromo first\u201d ideology, returned to Ethiopia from the United States in August last year, a few months after Abiy come to power. Oromo are the country\u2019s largest ethnic group, to which both Jawar and Prime Minister Abiy belong.\n\nThe young men gathered outside Jawar\u2019s house call themselves \u201cQeerroo\u201d, an Oromo term meaning \u201cbachelor\u201d adopted by politically active young men.\n\nWearing hooded sweatshirts, they shouted \u201cJawar, Jawar\u201d and \u201cAbiy Down! Abiy Down!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was about to go to bed when I saw Jawar\u2019s post that his house was surrounded by security without his knowledge. I called three of my friends and came running and saw more Qeerroos and Qarrees when I arrived at his house,\u201d Terefe Waltaji, a 27-year-old student, told Reuters.\n\nFederal Police Spokesman Jeylan Abdi said they had not received any information on what was happening at Jawar\u2019s house.\n\nA spokesperson for Abiy did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAbiy, who won the Nobel prize this month for his peacemaking efforts with longtime enemy Eritrea, came to power in April 2018 and began introducing political and economic reforms.\n\nThose reforms have opened up what was once one of Africa\u2019s most repressive nations, but also stoked violence as emboldened regional strongmen build ethnic powerbases and compete over political influence and resources.", "description": "Hundreds of supporters of an Ethiopian ethnic activist and media entrepreneur gathered outside his house on Wednesday, a day after it was surrounded by security forces following a warning by the prime minister against media owners \"fomenting unrest\".", "authors": ["Tiksa Nigeri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
