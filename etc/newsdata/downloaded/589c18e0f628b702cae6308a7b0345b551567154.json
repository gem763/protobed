On a central circular dais, audience surrounding, the cast painstakingly erected a juice bar with its half-an-orange dome, Holly Pigott\u2019s design copying the authentic shacks of the time. All this stage busyness was cleverly co-ordinated and, yes, fresh orange juice was duly pressed and served, yet the air of contrivance meant that this felt like a gimmick.\n\nIf this performance had a brash, country-and-western feel that sat ill with the finesse of Donizetti\u2019s music, the young singers delivered in terms of gusto. And, as an object lesson in opera-craft, they had none other than baritone Andrew Shore in the role of Dr Dulcamara, the travelling quack who provides the so-called elixir to Nemorino, in love with Adina and needing her to fall in love with him.\n\nWith Dulcamara in all-American getup, cutting a Colonel Sanders sort of figure with Mephistophelean black hair and a tall, white Stetson, Shore \u2013 who made his Met debut in this role \u2013 was a big presence, every bit the showman. Robert Lewis was the hapless Nemorino, his tenor strong and forthright, and words super-clear \u2013 if too unvaried in tone. His rival, Sergeant Belcore, was sung with bluster by Matthew Durkan. Claire Lees portrayed the sassy but fickle Adina, her sound bright, her phrasing graceful.\n\n\u2022Further performances on 6 and 7 September.", "description": "Iford Arts have relocated Donizetti\u2019s comic opera to a 1920s California citrus grove, and deliver it with gusto", "authors": ["Rian Evans"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acafacc3aeabfccd1972f354e151cbdf3c1eccb9/0_193_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=68dc40ebeb34f73831260d89ce0ea501"}
