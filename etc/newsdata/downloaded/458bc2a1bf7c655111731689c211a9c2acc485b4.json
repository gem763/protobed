FedEx also lowered its revenue outlook.\n\nThe profit warning comes after the company posted an 11% drop in fiscal first-quarter profit driven by weakness in its Express unit, which delivers packages by jets and is being hampered by global trade disruption.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think of FedEx\u2019s report this quarter? Join the conversation below.\n\nMeanwhile, FedEx\u2019s Ground unit, where revenue is growing largely due to carrying more e-commerce packages, is spending heavily on additional transportation costs and equipment rentals to keep up with that demand.\n\nThe company said it is taking more cost-cutting steps to try to offset the weaker environment, including retiring planes and grounding others after the holiday shopping season.\n\n\u201cThe global macro economy continues to soften, and we are taking steps to reduce capacity,\u201d FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call.\n\nOne of the challenges to FedEx\u2019s business is the lack of a trade deal with China, which has reduced the movement of goods internationally. Mr. Smith said the company initially expected a trade resolution as it entered its current fiscal year. \u201cWe were hopeful of a trade deal and some sort of return to normalcy and that has not taken place,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the first quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx reported a profit of $745 million, or $2.84 a share, compared with $835 million, or $3.10 a share, a year earlier. Excluding expenses related to its integration of TNT Express, per-share earnings were $3.05.\n\nRevenue declined slightly to $17.05 billion.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of $3.15 a share and $17.06 billion in revenue.\n\nEarnings for the fiscal year ending in May are expected to be between $11 and $13 a share before mark-to-market accounting adjustments and integration expenses.\n\nLast year, FedEx posted adjusted earnings of $15.52 a share.\n\nThe weaker outlook comes as shippers and carriers gear up for the holiday shopping season, when planning and upgrades will be put to the test as the number of packages surges.\n\nIt also comes as FedEx is in the midst of major reshuffling in the delivery marketplace as demand rises for e-commerce shipments.\n\nIt will soon start delivering packages seven days a week throughout the entire year instead of just during the holidays and will bring into its own network nearly all of the two million packages it once handed off to the U.S. Postal Service for delivery to doorsteps. Those added costs are weighing on FedEx\u2019s bottom line.\n\nFedEx will also be trying to expand its e-commerce business without delivering packages for the largest online player in the U.S., Amazon.com. FedEx in recent months ended its two major shipping contracts with Amazon, forgoing about $900 million in annual revenue. Instead, FedEx is aligning itself with retailers like Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. , as well as other online businesses that compete with Amazon. FedEx recently signed on Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc. as a customer, for instance, to deliver the retailer\u2019s online orders.\n\nFedEx is continuing to raise prices to offset the higher costs associated with all of the online orders to homes. Next year, it plans to raise rates an average of 4.9% on packages sent through its Express and Ground networks, while imposing a 5.9% rate increase on Freight shipments.\n\nDespite the weakness in the Express division, FedEx continues spending heavily to modernize its air fleet and some processing facilities.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nFedEx\u2019s profit in the fiscal first quarter a year ago was $835 million. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was $8.35 million.\n\nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com", "description": "The delivery giant lowered its outlook for the year and is taking more cost-cutting steps, sending its shares down sharply in after-hours trading.", "authors": ["Paul Ziobro", "Paul.Ziobro Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107538/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
