People know who he is,\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cBut as the campaign continues people are starting to see some of his flaws, some of his missteps.\u201d\n\nThe contrast with Biden makes increasing sense for Buttigieg. The South Bend mayor, believing that his core campaign pitch transcends ideology, is competing in some way with every one of his top rivals ahead of the Iowa caucuses. But Buttigieg also said he believes that he is unlikely to win voters fixated on Medicare for All and the candidates who back it, meaning he needs to peel away support elsewhere to grow in the Democratic primary.\n\n\"I think we have to make the case, but I also think that if you have decided that your single criterion for the nominee is you want the left-most candidate, then you've already got your candidate,\" Buttigieg said. \"That's not going to be me.\"\n\nEvan Bayh, the former Indiana governor and senator who has participated in a campaign event for Biden and is planning on attending a Buttigieg event, said Buttigieg is trying to chart a course through the middle of the primary.\n\nHe\u2019s \u201csaying, look, we need to do better because the challenge is greater\u201d than the current system can handle, Bayh said, \u201cbut we can't go so far to make it politically suicidal which banning private healthcare would entail. And that's the ground he's trying to find. For lack of a better term, [he's] trying to be a progressive but pragmatic about it.\"\n\nBut Jim Messina, the campaign manager for former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, said drawing distinctions on policy will only take candidates so far with undecided primary voters.\n\n\u201cI am skeptical detailed differences on policy really win large swaths of undecided voters,\u201d Messina wrote in an email. \u201cDemocrats are like everyone else, they want to support a candidate who lays out a compelling vision for the future and inspires them. It doesn\u2019t mean policy doesn\u2019t matter, it just this move is unlikely to accomplish the task at hand.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

During a recent bus tour through Iowa, Buttigieg said that while he and Warren share many of the same goals, \"she's more interested in the fighting part of it. I'm more interested in outcomes.\"\n\nWarren supporters leapt on the comment, noting her role implementing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but Buttigieg stood by the claim.\n\n\"I think my point is that the tone of our campaigns is very different,\u201d he said. \u201cI won't shrink from a fight. I just picked a very big one with this drug policy and I'm prepared to stand for what we believe in and face anyone who's going to challenge that. But I also think it's important to think about what kind of figure America is going to need when the Trump presidency ends.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5f/d7/837462844d4a876e98df4189f64c/191011-buttigieg-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
