It is two blocks from the First District police station and the office where homicide detectives are based.\n\nA police spokesman said the teenager was found on the front steps of an apartment building. At an afternoon news conference, Police Chief Peter Newsham said the victim had been shot multiple times and that it appears he was targeted. He said police did not know a motive for the killing.\n\n[Man on life support after shooting along troubled Northeast Washington road]\n\nHours later, police were called to another deadly shooting, this time in Northeast Washington.\n\nPolice said two men were found fatally shot inside a rowhouse in the 1600 block of Rosedale Street NE just before 10 p.m.\n\nThe victims were not identified but were described as being in their mid- to late 20s, Newsham said.\n\nThe chief said a motive for the shooting was not known, and it was not clear if the victims lived there.\n\nPolice said they were searching for a male seen fleeing the scene. He was described as black with a medium complexion and long dreadlocks. He was 5-foot-8 to 5-foot-10 and wore dark clothing.\n\nAbout two dozen people gathered on the street nearby, many of them crying loudly and hugged each other as they arrived and heard news of the shooting.\n\n\u201cYou can hear the families that are here in the neighborhood,\u201d Newsham said. \u201cThey are absolutely devastated by this.\u201d\n\nNewsham said that police, prosecutors and judges need to do a better job of arresting, convicting and sentencing those who are responsible for such violent acts.\n\n\u201cTo be quite honest, I\u2019m sick and tired of the shootings that are happening in our city, and I think collectively we have to do something about it,\u201d the chief said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTeenager dies in afternoon shooting one block from Nationals Park\n\nGunfire from speeding car damages vehicles, buildings in Kingman Park\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The motives in the shootings were not immediately known, police said.", "authors": ["Clarence Williams", "Local Reporter Covering Crime", "Breaking News", "Public Safety Issues", "Peter Hermann", "Reporter Covering Crime", "Specifically The D.C.
