I find rational, intelligent arguments and ideas inspiring. I find thinking things through and coming to practical, thoughtful, ethical conclusions inspiring. I find adults with knowledge and expertise in various areas, sharing their knowledge and expertise inspiring. I find those who boldly speak the truth, despite the consequences, no matter how unpopular that truth may be, inspiring. I find dogs who rescue drowning baby deer inspiring. Give me Aretha Franklin and a full-bodied red. While often highly entertaining and useful, once trained to bring me snacks and refill my drink, children don\u2019t inspire me\n\nMoreover, in a culture that routinely ignores, denigrates, erases, and disrespects older women, tossing them aside the moment they are no longer fuckable or able to reproduce the species, being ordered to \u2018listen to youth\u2019 strikes me as not only a slap in the face, but a call to ignorance.\n\nNo thank you. I will listen to those with life experience, those I deem to hold valuable knowledge and compelling ideas, and those with a well-developed sense of humor. I\u2019m not going to decide who to listen to based on their having a post-aughts birthday.", "description": "", "authors": ["Meghan Murphy", "Spectator.Us Listen-Children-Climate-Change"], "top_image": ""}
