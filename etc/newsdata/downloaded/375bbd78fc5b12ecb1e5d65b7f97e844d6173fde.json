I am confident that our leadership is well positioned to execute our refreshed business strategy and drive toward our goal of being essential for consumers and businesses on a daily basis. I also want to take a moment to again thank John Zidich for 40 incredible years at Gannett and wish him well in his retirement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so proud and honored to lead such an iconic brand as USA TODAY, building upon its core commitments to trusted, award-winning journalism and role as an industry innovator,\u201d said Maribel Perez Wadsworth, incoming publisher of USA TODAY. \u201cI could not be more excited to work with this incredibly talented team, whose passion and enthusiasm consistently creates excellent experiences for our readers and our advertisers.\u201d\n\nWadsworth joined Gannett more than 20 years ago, when she worked as an agriculture beat reporter at the Rockford Register Star.
