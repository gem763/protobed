The pastor and former 'Friends Talking Faith\u2019 co-host had been out on bail since Oct. 17.\n\nThe Medical Examiner's Office for Seminole County ruled Fulwider's death to be a suicide. Fulwider was arrested earlier this month after a young woman told investigators he sexually abused her for years while he was her pastor.\n\nPASTOR\u2019S VEHICLE ABDUCTION CAUGHT ON CAMERA AS THOUSANDS PETITION TO FIND HIM\n\nThe alleged abuse began in 2014 when the victim was 14 and Fulwider was the senior minister at the First Congregational Church of Winter Park.
