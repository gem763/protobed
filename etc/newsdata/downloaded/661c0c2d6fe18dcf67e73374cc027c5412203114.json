It is a vile hate sheet which publishes anti-Semitic garbage, and ridicules women and gays. It is sewage in print.\n\nThe odd thing about the fact that a man was sentenced to lose his liberty for a year for printing nasty things, was that it caused barely a ripple in the halls of Toronto journalism.\n\nThe only reporter I could find with the grit to denounce the court's action was Globe and Mail columnist Marcus Gee.\n\nHe wrote: \"None of the usual guardians of free speech seemed to find it even a little troubling.\"\n\nJames Sears, 55, was found guilty in January of two counts \u2014 promoting hatred against women and Jews \u2014 for the contents of 22 issues of Your Ward News. (Colin Perkel/Canadian Press)\n\nJudging from the \"thunderous silence,\" he said, they must consider it perfectly acceptable to send the editor to jail and put the publisher under house arrest for a year.\n\nThe judge's decision comes at a particularly parlous time for journalists and the idea of a free press.\n\nInside our courtrooms, judges have been leaning more and more to publication bans denying the public the right, and it is a right, to know what is going on inside them.\n\nIf we really believed in a truly free press, we wouldn't throw publishers in jail for the words they publish.\n\nTo many, this seems rather puny when positioned alongside what is happening to reporters, and the functioning of free journalism, in other parts of the world.\n\nAround the world, reporters and editors are being arrested, tortured, silenced \u2014 even murdered.\n\nHatice Cengiz (centre), the fiancee of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and CEO of Amazon and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos (left) stand by a memorial stone during an event marking the one-year anniversary of the assassination of Khashoggi.

The number of countries considered safe for journalists has continued to decline.\n\nLast October, we heard of the gruesome murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.\n\nThis past spring, Irish journalist Lyra McKee was murdered in Derry by a dissident IRA cell.\n\nThe numbers suggest that a free press is gradually scaling down to a few countries in the West.\n\nBut even in the US, where local newspapers are dying, the country's leader calls reporters \"enemies of the people\" and says they traffic in fake news. The result is that Trump rallies have turned into beat-the-press meetings which could easily boil over into violence.\n\nJournalist Lyra McKee is shown in a 2017 file photo at an event in Italy. She was killed in Derry, Northern Ireland after gunfire erupted before the Easter Rising commemorative parades. (Francesco Cuoccio/EPA-EFE)\n\nViolence such as the murder of five employees of the Capital Gazette last year in Annapolis.\n\nThe cops called it a targeted shooting. Jailing a hatemonger in Toronto does nothing to reduce hate in this country.\n\nBut it does reduce, albeit slightly, the idea that a free press is something more than a slogan.\n\nThat in some parts of the world, it is life and death. All the more reason to make sure we protect it here.\n\nClick 'listen' above to hear Michael's essay.", "description": "In light of the sentencing of James Sears, editor and publisher of a hateful publication, Michael Enright reflects upon freedom of the press in Canada and the roles of journalists globally.", "authors": ["Michael Enright"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4907621.1570202713!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/saudi-writer-killed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
