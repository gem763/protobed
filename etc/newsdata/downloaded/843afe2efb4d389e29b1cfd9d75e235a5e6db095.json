Investors have taken his legislative defeats\u2014which could lead to an extension of the deadline\u2014as a positive signal that Brexit might be deferred and deflected to a softer outcome. The British pound GBPUSD, +0.5630% rose 0.2% against the U.S. dollar this morning, beginning its fourth day of gains.\n\nBut FTSE 100 index, comprising the largest London-listed stocks, often drops when the pound rallies, as it contains many large U.K.-based multinationals that book earnings in foreign currencies, meaning their profits are worth less when the pound is strong.\n\nAmong individual stocks, big risers included media group Future PLC FUTR, +8.72%, which gained as much as 20% after it said its trading was stronger than expectations. Shares in the engineering investment firm Melrose Industries MRO, +6.17%, which acquired British engineer GKN a year ago, leapt 5.7% as it reported that losses more than halved in the past 12 months and profit margins improved by 2 percentage points, indicating its turnaround is working.\n\nRegional U.K. banking group CYBG CYBG, -21.22% was among the biggest fallers, plunging almost 20% after it reported a larger-than-expected bill of \u00a3300 million to \u00a3450 million ($500 million) from penalties tied to the past mis-selling of payment protection insurance, a widespread banking scandal in the U.K. Analysts at Jefferies said that the credibility of the bank\u2019s management \u201cis challenged on PPI, and investors are likely to avoid this share until results on November 28\u201d.\n\nElsewhere, shares in Dubai-based payments solutions business Network International NETW, -9.57% dropped 8.9% after its biggest shareholders, the Emirates NBD Bank and the private-equity firms Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic, announced they had reduced their combined stake in the firm from 43% to 20%.", "description": "Investors have taken a series of parliamentary defeats for new Prime Minister Boris Johnson as a positive signal that Brexit might be deferred and deflected...", "authors": ["Mark Cobley"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ536_boris__ZG_20190902132010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
