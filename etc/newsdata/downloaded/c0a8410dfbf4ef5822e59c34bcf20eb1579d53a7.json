The story below involves the former:\n\nWhistleblower at center of Ukraine scandal wrote a memo describing a White House official as \"visibly shaken by what had transpired\" in Trump's phone call. https://t.co/RshWDdUFX6 \u2014 Aman Batheja (@amanbatheja) October 8, 2019\n\nMollie Hemingway wasn\u2019t having any of that:\n\n1) Rollout of latest attempt to oust Trump was irreparably harmed by the transcript release. No need to tell us what those opposed thought of it because we already read it.\n\n2) If any adult was \"visibly shaken\" by that call between world leaders, that speaks to their instability. https://t.co/4YhHw1JpWF \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) October 9, 2019\n\nOther than that, keep pushing the Democrat talking points, MSM!\n\n\"visibly shaken\" \u2013 this is a joke. Maybe shaking from TDS https://t.co/NiTamsnrt3 \u2014 Susan Wilcox (@SuseWilcox) October 9, 2019\n\nExactly. The hearsay whistleblower either was told a drummed up account of the call or has such severe TDS that their perception of the call was distorted through that TDS lense. \u2014 T-Covfefe (@MyPlace4U) October 9, 2019\n\nWhen you are trying to scale up nothing to something big phrases like \"visibly shaken\" add suspense. Sorta like the \"literally shaking rn\" twitter trend. https://t.co/kjGD6hq4JU \u2014 John Commodore Barry (@ShrinkGov) October 9, 2019\n\nThe hyperbole from the Left concerning this has really jumped the shark.", "description": "Bingo!", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/molliehemingway.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
