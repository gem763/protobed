That could set a Palantir IPO date back to 2022 or 2023.\n\nPalantir did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nPalantir, which has never been profitable, had reportedly been making efforts to gear up a public offering, which included hiring its first sales team and eliminating lavish employee perks, like 13-course tasting-menu lunches, that could raise eyebrows among public market investors. Employees were also reportedly no longer allowed to expense last-minute international airfare and at least one person was fired for expensing off-the-wall purchases like lingerie.\n\nRead more: This $20 billion startup is reportedly cutting lavish perks as it tries to kill its employees' 'entitlement syndrome' ahead of a possible IPO\n\nBecause of Palantir's work with the US military and government agencies, the data-mining firm has long been subject to scrutiny by outside critics. Most recently, Business Insider learned that Palantir employees themselves were becoming increasingly split over the company's ties to government work \u2014 specifically its business dealings with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency involved in detaining and deporting people over immigration violations.", "description": "Palantir has reportedly courted Singapore's\u00a0Temasek Holdings, SoftBank, and other non-US investors for a coming round.", "authors": ["Nick Bastone"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/552568f3ecad04387a919568-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
