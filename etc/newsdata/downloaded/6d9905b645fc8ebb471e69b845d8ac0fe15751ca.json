It gets a commission for every use, it has no physical assets and it is already the market leader.\n\n'But we do not know the price yet. It is extremely difficult for new investors coming in at an IPO [initial public offering] to make money \u2013 as most of the current crop have proved. All the money has already been made.'\n\nAirbnb started life as AirBed & Breakfast in 2008 after two of its co-founders, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, let out their apartment in San Francisco. It now has seven million listings in 100,000 cities and reported revenues of 'substantially more' than $1billion for its second quarter this year.\n\nUber was forecast to have a value of up to $120billion (\u00a397billion) at its stock market debut but is now worth $55billion (\u00a344billion)\n\nIt is secretive about its financial performance but was most recently valued at $31billion (\u00a325billion) and reportedly made profits of $93million (\u00a375billion) in 2017.\n\nChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at spreadbetting firm IG, said there will be 'huge demand' for Airbnb shares because it is 'one that a lot of younger people will recognise'.\n\n'If when the official documents come through, and you see they are doing a WeWork and burning through cash, then you might see enthusiasm dim. The investing rationale is maybe a bit stronger than WeWork, but it depends on how these numbers play out.'\n\nIG will let investors bet on Airbnb's float price ahead of its flotation, through a 'grey market' that tests investor appetite. Similar grey markets run by IG for the floats of Facebook and Royal Mail have come close to predicting the listing price.\n\nA spokesman for Hargreaves Lansdown said: 'Household name IPOs attract interest from investors, particularly those where people have direct experience of their products and services.'", "description": "Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK's biggest retail stockbroker, last week asked customers to register their interest after the room rental giant revealed plans to float in 2020.", "authors": ["Harriet Dennys For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
