It emerged in court that Cele drank his victims' blood after he killed them.\n\nDuring interviews this week, it was clear commissioners were concerned about transformation in the judiciary.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, one of the candidates, advocate Avrielle Maier-Frawley, was asked if appointing her to the Bench would contribute to transformation.\n\n\"It would contribute to the gender representative issue, gender equality issue and also the gender diversity issue,\" she responded.\n\nMaier-Frawley also told the commissioners that she experienced sexism during her career.\n\n\"Even when my career was prospering in the first 12 years of practice, I would face a situation where a client would say: 'You are too young, I hope you can handle the matter',\" she said.\n\nGender-based violence\n\nSome commissioners also quizzed candidates about their views on gender-based violence. A spate of incidents of gender-based violence swept through the country over the last few months.\n\nOne candidate, David Makhoba, said men and women needed to be educated about gender-based violence.\n\nHe said a \"lot of work\" needed to be done by politicians and churches, among others, to address challenges.\n\n\"On Thursday (October 3), I dealt with a matter whereby a 45-year-old raped an 11-year-old. It is bad out there\u2026 we, presiding officers, listen to this every day,\" he said.\n\nThe JSC recommended the following seven candidates to President Cyril Ramaphosa:\n\n- Rean Strydom\n\n- Moleboheng Mamorena Pascalina Mdalana-Mayisela\n\n- Avrielle Maier-Frawley\n\n- David Makhoba\n\n- Shanaaz Christine Mia\n\n- Marcus Lekgaloa Senyatsi\n\n- Elmarie van der Schyff", "description": "An advocate who attempted more than once \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to land a spot on the Bench, has finally been recommended for appointment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/775/c214fcf09b66452c9f1777078792767c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
