I believe they have the powers to do that.\n\n\"I would welcome them withholding bail during the period of the protests.\n\nExtinction Rebellion protestors at London City Airport Credit: Heathcliff O'Malley More", "description": "A former Paralympian brought chaos to London City Airport\u00a0after he managed to climb on top of a plane to prevent it from taking off, as the police have been left facing questions over security concerns.\u00a0 James Brown, a visually impaired athlete who won a bronze medal at London 2012, was able to pull", "authors": ["Izzy Lyons"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U9W9.UwYcFz6ZcaYgkAwzg--~B/aD02OTM7dz0xMTA5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/4a16fcbec5e12b0f5563b0bc5a837986", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
