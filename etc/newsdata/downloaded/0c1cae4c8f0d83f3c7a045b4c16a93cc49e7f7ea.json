Not flavor-wise, but in a culinary Twilight Zone-type of way? That\u2019s the feeling I get when I look at the sandwich Slick Woods apparently ordered at The Wing.\n\nBusiness of Fashion writer Chantal Fernandez tweeted that she had interviewed Woods at the women\u2019s networking space, and the model ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. The result was a spread consisting of everything needed to make the meal, but deconstructed and separated in its own little space, like an adult Lunchable.\n\nI interviewed Slick Woods at the Wing and she ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. In their defense it wasn\u2019t on the menu but...this is what they brought her pic.twitter.com/q15TugS3Qc \u2014 Chantal Fernandez (@chantalfdez) September 11, 2019\n\nNow, as Fernandez points out, the breakfast sandwich wasn\u2019t on The Wing\u2019s menu, but if you have all the ingredients, couldn\u2019t you have slapped it all together? Have we not learned anything from watched Chopped, or experiencing the real-life challenge of having to make a meal using everything in your fridge before leaving town the following day? And for those who aren\u2019t familiar with the rules of The Wing, members are not permitted to bring in outside food, so there wouldn\u2019t be an option for Seamless delivery.\n\nGranted, Woods\u2019s order, while very continental breakfast-vibes, didn\u2019t look as terrifyingly nasty as a Fyre Fest cheese sandwich, but I still have a lot of questions. Questions that will keep me up at night. Why couldn\u2019t someone fry up an egg real quick? Or, were the eggs already pre-boiled? But why TWO ramekins filled with eggs? Can we at least have some Tapatio on the side? (At least it\u2019s Keto-friendly, in case anyone was wondering if there were any low-carb options at The Wing.)\n\nI just hope she was able to cure any hanger pains and grab a sandwich at a bodega afterward.\n\nStay in touch.
