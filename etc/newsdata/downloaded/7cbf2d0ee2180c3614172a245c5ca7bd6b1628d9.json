Win-win.'\n\nHere, Jamie shares his advice...\n\nJamie Oliver has taken on a new challenge, stopping British households from throwing away \u00a31billion a month of food waste\n\n1. Smart stack\n\nThe temperature varies in any fridge as heat rises, so keep your meat and fish in the cooler part at the bottom, and foods like dairy in the middle.\n\nMake sure you keep cooked meat on a separate shelf to any raw meat and keep the raw stuff on your lowest shelf.\n\nThe door is the warmest area of the fridge that is exposed to warm air every time the fridge is opened. Keep products like juices and condiments here.\n\n2. Know what not to put in your fridge\n\nOnly put things in the fridge that actually need to go in.\n\nItems like potatoes do not need to be in there, so store those in a dark, dry place somewhere else.\n\nThe fridge can make some food go off faster, such as bread which will keep fresher for longer outside of the fridge.\n\nTop 10 most wasted food items 1. Bread 2. Cheese 3. Potatoes 4. Celery 5. Lemon 6. Bananas 7. Lettuce 8. Apples 9. Bagged salad 10. Mince\n\n3. Easy freeze-y\n\nFreezers are like a time capsule for fresh food.\n\nIt is like pressing the pause button, locking in nutrients and preserving taste, especially when it comes to fruit and veg.\n\nIf you have got some fruit and it is about to go bad, put it in a container and into the freezer in a container and they will be perfect for a delicious smoothie another day.\n\n4. Wrap up herbs and salad\n\nA great tip to keep herbs fresher for longer is to wrap them in slightly damp kitchen towel before you pop them in the fridge.\n\nYou can also line your veg drawers with paper towels which will absorb the moisture and condensation from the vegetables you store in your fridge, keeping them fresher for longer.\n\nBut remember to change these with every food shop!\n\nBread is a British staple and we have been making it for thousands of years, but research suggests that it is the number one most wasted food in the UK. Instead of putting stale bread in the bin, cut it up into chunks to use another time as croutons, or whizz it up into breadcrumbs and pop them in the freezer\n\n5. Blitz your bread\n\nBread is a British staple and we have been making it for thousands of years, but research suggests that it is the number one most wasted food in the UK.\n\nInstead of putting stale bread in the bin, cut it up into chunks to use another time as croutons, or whizz it up into breadcrumbs and pop them in the freezer.\n\nYou can use breadcrumbs on the top of mac and cheese, a crumb coating for healthy, homemade fish fingers or to add texture to tomato pasta sauce.\n\nOnly put things in the fridge that actually need to go in. Items like potatoes do not need to be in there, so store those in a dark, dry place somewhere else. Stock image\n\n6. Double up\n\nPortioning up food and freezing it is a lifesaver for those days you come home and just need something quick.\n\nIf you're cooking something like a ragu, curry or stew simply make double the amount!\n\nIf you freeze it thin and flat it will freeze really quickly, and defrost really quickly, too.\n\nMake your own pickled vegetables with any random bits of crunchy veg like carrot, broccoli, cauliflower and cucumber. Simply put it in a jar with some vinegar, salt, sugar and water and you've got a brilliant pickle\n\n7. Pickle it\n\nMake your own pickled vegetables with any random bits of crunchy veg like carrot, broccoli, cauliflower and cucumber.\n\nSimply put it in a jar with some vinegar, salt, sugar and water and you've got a brilliant pickle.\n\nYou can add herbs, mustard seeds and whatever else you like to change up the flavour too.\n\n8. Herb flavour bombs\n\nA great tip to make your fresh herbs last longer is to freeze them before they go to waste.\n\nChop them, pop them in an ice cube tray with a little bit of oil, and whack them in the freezer. That way you can then use them whenever you need a bit of extra flavour.\n\nIf you have got some fruit and it is about to go bad, put it in a container and into the freezer in a container and they will be perfect for a delicious smoothie another day\n\n9. Chill your chillies\n\nIf you catch chillies before they lose their freshness, or even when they're slightly past their best, you guessed it, you can freeze them.\n\nThen, when you want to add a little heat, you just grate it into a dish whilst cooking, or even over the top of a curry.\n\n10. Reboot leftovers\n\nWhen it comes to meat, the most wasted is chicken and there are so many things that you can do with a bit of leftover chicken.\n\nTry turning it into a simple noodle dish, a beautiful salad, comforting pies and stews, risottos packed full of flavour, or a hearty chicken soup.\n\nPortioning up food and freezing it is a lifesaver for those days you come home and just need something quick. If you're cooking something like a ragu, curry or stew simply make double the amount! If you freeze it thin and flat it will freeze really quickly, and defrost really quickly, too\n\nTo help the public take on the Eat Your Fridge Challenge Jamie Oliver has created new recipes, tips and food hacks all designed to help the public look at food waste in a new light.\n\nHotpoint are also donating to a food waste charity every time #EatYourFridge is used", "description": "British households throw away a whopping \u00a31billion of food waste.
