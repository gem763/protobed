As India is known for art and culture Odissi dance form was held in great esteem before the 17th century and even the royalty was expected to be expert dancers.\n\nIts history can be traced back to the ancient Sanskrit Hindu text called 'Natya Shastra\u2019 which deals with different performing arts. According to the sources, it owes its origin to the temple dances of Devadasis.\n\nWe are all aware of the temples of Orissa and various carvings displaying various forms of dance postures as well as erotic carvings which is clear evidence of the dance forms in the ancient Orissa.\n\nOrissapost\n\nOdissi dance pays great importance to Lord Jagannath who is considered to be the god of the universe and is worshipped by the people of Orissa.\n\nIt is believed that emperor Kharavela enjoyed this dance form which can be justified by the cave engraving near Udayagiri who is believed to popularise this dance form to a great extent during his reign.\n\nHowever, during the Mughal era the dancers were only looked at as temple dancers. They used to entertain the royal courts and this is how the focus of their status shifted but regained its reputation after the end of Mughal era.\n\nWhat is special about the dance form?\n\nThe foremost reason as to why is it special is because of the beautiful costumes and expressions that dancers wear when they perform. The sight itself is captivating enough just like the dance form. The sarees that dancers wear are mostly bright in colours like purple, orange, green and red that are accompanied by traditional borders with fine embroidery work and some sparkling embellishments which sets them apart. The two most commonly used sarees for this dance are Sambalpuri saree and Bomkai saree.\n\nOn top of all this, jewellery that is mostly silver unlike other dance attires that use gold, adds to the charm of the whole dance form. The waistband is another must-add.\n\nYoutube\n\nOdissi now\n\nThis particular dance form is now globally recognised and it entered into the Guinness Book of World Records in 2012 after 560 Indian Odissi dancers gave a performance together to create a new record.\n\nThey gave a memorable dance performance at the Kalinga Stadium, Bhubaneswar, Orissa.
