As a contestant she would be good. I don't know if she could win.\n\n\"She doesn't mime. It's called lip-syncing... lip-sync for your life.\"\n\nLouis first sat on The X Factor judging panel with Cheryl in 2008 and they worked together until 2010.\n\nThe duo have endured a strained relationship for more than a decade, which first kicked off when Louis managed Girls Aloud from 2002 to 2004.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: SIPA USA/PA Images)\n\nCheryl and Louis have been enemies ever since he managed the girl band, with Cheryl accusing him of \"taking cheques\" for no work and calling the band members \"fat\".\n\nIn the past, Louis swiped: \"I am a much better manager than she is a singer.\n\n\"She seems to be in the fashion business now, selling fake hairpieces, fake eyelashes, fake everything.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nIn 2015, boss man Simon Cowell commented on the pair's ongoing feud.\n\nSpeaking on Good Morning Britain at the time, he mocked the two judges: \"There was always going to be a clash, they\u2019re like Tom and Jerry these two.\n\n\"I wish they\u2019d fight more on the show actually.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHowever, it seems that Simon may actually agreed with the Irish music boss, as he's not invited Cheryl onto the judging panel for X Factor: Celebrity.\n\nThe show kickstarts this weekend with Simon, Louis and Nicole returning to the famous judging panel.\n\nCheryl might not have got the call for the X Factor but she appeared as a coach on The Greatest Dancer in August.\n\nThe ITV singing contest is back, but not as we know it, with famous faces fighting for a chance to be crowned champion and come out with a record deals.\n\n\"It's time for something different,\" says Simon. \"My credibility is at stake. If it doesn\u2019t work I look like a total idiot. So no pressure.\"\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity airs on ITV 12 October at 8:35pm", "description": "The X Factor judge reignited his long-running feud with the pop star by accusing her of lip-syncing", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Getty Splash", "Itv", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article6599973.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Louis-Walsh-Cheryl-Cole.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
