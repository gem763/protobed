The self-styled dealmaker has given up the leverage of the United States\u2019 military presence in multiple places around the world without negotiating concessions from those cheering for U.S. forces to leave.\n\nFor a president who has repeatedly promised to end the \u201cendless wars,\u201d the decisions reflect a broader conviction that bringing troops home \u2014 or at least moving them out of hot spots \u2014 is more important than haggling for advantage. In his view, decades of overseas military adventurism has only cost the country enormous blood and treasure, and waiting for deals would prolong a national disaster.\n\nBut veteran diplomats, foreign policy experts and key lawmakers fear that Trump is squandering U.S. power and influence in the world with little to show for it. By pulling troops out unilaterally, they argue, Trump has emboldened America\u2019s enemies and distressed its allies. Friends like Israel, they note, worry about U.S. staying power. Foes like North Korea and the Taliban learn that they can achieve their goals without having to pay a price.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to divine any real strategic logic to the president\u2019s moves,\u201d said John P. Hannah, a senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney. \u201cThe only real connective tissue I see is the almost preternatural isolationist impulse that he invariably seems to revert to when left to his own devices internationally \u2014 even to the point that it overrides his supposed deal-making instincts.\u201d\n\nReuben E. Brigety II, a former Navy officer and ambassador to the African Union under President Barack Obama who now serves as dean of the Elliott School for International Affairs at George Washington University, said just as worrisome as the decisions themselves was the seemingly capricious way they were made.\n\nTrump, he said, often seems more interested in pleasing autocrats like Kim Jong Un of North Korea and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey than in organizing any kind of coherent policymaking process to consider the pros and cons.\n\n\u201cWhen he canceled the South Korea military exercises, the only person he consulted was Kim Jong Un,\u201d Brigety said. \u201cThe decision to abandon the Kurds came after a brief phone call with Erdogan. So they weren\u2019t taken because he had personally reflected on the strategic disposition of American forces around the world. They were taken after he took the counsel of strongmen over that of his own advisers.\u201d\n\nAll the complaints from the career national security establishment, however, carry little weight with Trump, who dismisses his critics as the same ones who got the country into a catastrophic war in Iraq. While that may not be true in all cases, Trump makes the case that 18 years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, it is time to pull out even without extracting trade-offs in return.\n\n\u201cWhen I watch these pundits that always are trying to take a shot, I say \u2014 they say, \u2018What are we getting out of it?\u2019 \u201d Trump told reporters Monday as he hosted a Cabinet meeting. \u201cYou know what we\u2019re getting out of it? We\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home. That\u2019s a big thing. And it\u2019s going to probably work. But if it doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re going to have people fighting like they\u2019ve been fighting for 300 years. It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s really very simple.\u201d\n\nThe United States has about 200,000 troops stationed around the world, roughly half of them in relatively less dangerous posts in Europe or Asia where U.S. forces have maintained a presence since the end of World War II. Tens of thousands of others are deployed in the Middle East, although only a fraction of them are in the active war zones of Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.\n\nIt took only a few dozen Special Forces operators near the border in northern Syria to deter Turkey from assaulting America\u2019s Kurdish allies there, but soon after Trump talked with Erdogan on Oct. 6, the president announced on a Sunday night that they would be pulled back. Turkey then launched a ferocious attack on the Kurds, and by the time a convoy of U.S. troops moved away over the weekend, they were shown in a widely circulated video being pelted by angry Kurds throwing potatoes to express their sense of betrayal.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Taliban have wanted the United States to pull troops out of Afghanistan, Turkey has wanted the Americans out of northern Syria, and North Korea has wanted them to at least stop military exercises with South Korea.President Donald Trump has now to some extent at least obliged all three", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b4T6fiXkXJHclGnWGj2wmw--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/d428e23f8b06ad6cec967ec3d7b64227", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
