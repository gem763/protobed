Figures revealed this week showed that Labour made a loss of \u00a3655,000 last year, compared to a profit of \u00a31.45m the year before, as a result of a fall in membership, rising staffing costs and losses incurred by last summer\u2019s Labour Live event. The party's finances are likely to come under further strain if it has to fight a general election later this year.\n\nSome NEC members are worried that the financial situation could become unmanageable if the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) finds that the party has failed to protect Jewish members.\n\nThe watchdog opened a formal investigation into Labour in August and is due to report next year. The Independent understands that multiple NEC members and other senior party figures have been asked to give evidence to the inquiry.\n\nAmid growing concern about the outcome of the inquiry, several NEC members are understood to have asked officials what indemnity Labour has, following fears that members of the committee may have to personally foot the bill if the party runs out of money.\n\nThey believe that, like trustees of a charity, they are legally and financially responsible for the party.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The party has been asked to let us know what indemnity it has because there are concerns that NEC members are going to ultimately be responsible for this.\n\n\u201cIf we were a charity, the Charity Commission would have been all over us months ago. The EHRC is effectively playing the same role as the Charity Commission and we are effectively the trustees. That means we are legally responsible.\u201d\n\nA second NEC member said: \u201cThere have been concerns raised about who is legally responsible for the Labour Party. Some of us are worried about this. The grown-ups on the NEC who do not have the backing of the trade unions are all concerned. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s occurred to most of the NEC that there could be financial implications, but it has to some of us. We\u2019ve raised the question but haven\u2019t had an answer.\u201d\n\nAsked if they were confident the party would be able to cope financially with whatever the EHRC concludes, the member said: \u201cNo. There is no basis for that confidence.\u201d\n\nAnother Labour source with an understanding of the situation added: \u201cThere are fears that if the EHRC goes against the party then individual victims will have the right to go for damages from the party, and who knows where that ends up \u2013 nobody can be sure because there\u2019s no precedent for it.\n\n\u201cNobody quite knows what the liability is for the individuals NEC members. If they are liable then it makes it even more damaging that Jennie [Formby, Labour\u2019s general secretary] and her team won\u2019t share their understanding of what the damages might be and the possible implications. Clearly, NEC members are worried about that scenario but the conversation got completely shut down.\u201d\n\nSuggesting that Labour could run out of money if it had to pay extensive damages, the source continued: \u201cCouncils all around the country are having to borrow money to pay victims of historic sexual injustice. The danger is that the Labour Party will have to do the same if it is subject to victim or class action, having been found to be institutionally antisemitic.\u201d\n\nSome also voiced concerns that, in this scenario, there would be \u201canother round of victim-blaming\u201d, with Jewish people blamed by some for the party\u2019s difficulties.\n\nNEC members have repeatedly raised concerns that, despite their legal responsibilities, they have not been allowed to read or contribute to the party\u2019s response to the EHRC.\n\nThe response is understood to have been drafted by party officials in conjunction with Mr Corbyn\u2019s team, but a small handful of NEC officers decided it should be submitted without being seen or approved by the wider committee.\n\nOne NEC member said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the party has made a very solid, sound presentation to the commission or the complete opposite. There is a total ignorance of what has been said on behalf of the party.\n\n\u201cMost of the NEC don\u2019t trouble themselves about these things. They haven\u2019t worked out that they will have, potentially, as individuals, a legal responsibility.\u201d\n\nLabour declined to comment, although sources said the party did not believe that individual NEC members could be held personally responsible.\n\nHowever, in a speech earlier this year, Baroness Hayter, Labour\u2019s deputy leader in the House of Lords and a former NEC member and chair of the Labour Party, said: \u201cThere\u2019s been a serious undermining of the NEC by denying its members, who have legal responsibility for the party, membership figures, financial structures, financial accounts, the submission in their names to the EHRC.\u201d", "description": "Members of Labour\u2019s ruling executive have privately voiced fears that the party could be bankrupted as a result of an official inquiry into antisemitism, The Independent has learnt.
