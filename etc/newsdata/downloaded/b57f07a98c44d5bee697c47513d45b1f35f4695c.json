It also requires overnight marinating, which doesn\u2019t suit last-minute cravings or weeknight grocery runs. This no-marinade-needed Marbella gets the job done \u2014 and well \u2014 in under an hour. Chicken thighs are seared hard until deep golden brown to render the fat, which also helps amp up the chicken flavor. This version is also significantly less sweet than the original, but if you like your brown sugar, use 1/3 cup instead. The reduced pan sauce is easy to love, so be sure to serve with a loaf of crusty bread to mop it all up.", "description": "The chicken Marbella recipe from \u201cThe Silver Palate Cookbook\u201d is rich and deeply flavorful, but time-consuming It also requires overnight marinating, which doesn\u2019t suit last-minute cravings or weeknight grocery runs This no-marinade-needed Marbella gets the job done \u2014 and well \u2014 in under an hour", "authors": ["Rick A.
