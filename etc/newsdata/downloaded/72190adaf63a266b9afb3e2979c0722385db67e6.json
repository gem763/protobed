MORE in 2020 and return a sense of normalcy to the White House, they may want to make sure that the current Democratic front runners are up to the job at hand. Winning a primary is one thing, but winning a general election is a completely different beast. When the top three candidates are a self avowed socialist, a former vice president mired in scandal, and a quasi populist at war with Wall Street, it\u2019s fair to that there is room for concern. Luckily, it\u2019s early.\n\nElizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio New study: Full-scale 'Medicare for All' costs trillion over 10 years MORE could potentially be the best candidate to take on President Trump in the general election and the worst candidate, all at once. She\u2019s clearly thoughtful, extremely smart, and prepared to lean into the historic moment that her candidacy presents, but like Hillary Clinton, she has yet to find her voice or ability to create a narrative that will drive apathetic Democrats to the polls on Election Day.\n\nThis can\u2019t be Dukakis in \u201888 or Kerry in 2004. Democrats don\u2019t need to prove that we\u2019re smarter than Republicans or occupy some moral high ground. Democrats need prove that they are listening to the voters, that they share their pain, and that they will fight like hell to improve their lives of all Americans; which is exactly what scares me.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe weakness of campaigns like Dukakis and Kerry wasn\u2019t rooted in their policy proposals, it was rooted in their inability to connect with voters who had differing life experiences. Whether it was a person of color or a blue collar voter, both Dukakis and Kerry failed to connect. The current field cannot afford to make the same mistake.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since a Massachusetts Democratic ran a successful presidential campaign. There is no Kennedy running for President this cycle and Democrats should be worried that once again, history may not be on our side. Despite the political landmines erupting behind the walls of 1600, Democrats cannot rest on their laurels and expect Republicans to abandon a vulnerable President who is barely hanging on.\n\nA lack of enthusiasm or support around one single candidate risks dividing the party and depressing turnout, ala Hillary Clinton in 2016. A left versus center battle only further exacerbates the factions that never truly coalesced around Hillary Clinton, leading to tepid support from the type of voters who were the foundation of the Obama coalition.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Mayor Pete seems like a smart, well intention guy, who could be the future of the Democratic Party. Amy Klobuchar would make a great Attorney General or leader of a Democratic Majority if we take back the Senate, but Democrats have yet to put forth a candidate that excites an uneasy Democratic base.\n\nCandidates like Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker have failed to live up to expectations and squandered an opportunity to turn their visions into a tangible movement. Candidates like Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have been unable to expand their base and build upon their name recognition and solidly their support. The result, a fluid nomination process that could damage the long term prospects of the eventual nominee. Things aren\u2019t exactly great.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPolicies like banning private insurance and packing the court risk turning off swing voters, and feeding into a conservative narrative that could potentially strengthen Republican turnout. Democrats don\u2019t need to pander to Trump voters but we also shouldn\u2019t put gasoline on the fire.Inspiration is what Democrats need, not wonky policies and plans with footnotes and annotations. Democratic voters, will select a nominee their heart, not a checklist of proposals.\n\nThat is why the eventual nominee needs to find a way to make an emotional connection This election can\u2019t be about academic policies or convoluted plans than voters know will never pass through Congress, it must be about connecting with individuals and laying out a better path forward. Democrats have no choice other than to rely on historic turnout from African Americans, suburban women, and millenials. Without it, Democrats risk another loss to President Trump.\n\nFailure cannot be an option. Failing to turn out these key constituencies would be political malpractice and would likely lead to the collapse of the Democratic Party as we know it. Trump\u2019s base will certainly turnout and attempt to settle the score for the president\u2019s likely impeachment, the question is whether Democrats will be fired up and excited to restore the blue wall that will evict the occupant of the White House.\n\nTrump is the leader of a movement that has etched its name in the history books alongside McCarthy and Nixon. If Democrats expect to be successful in 2020, they will nominate a candidate that can lead the movement to rebuild our institutions and restore faith in our Democracy. If you\u2019re scared about the potential reelection of Trump, you should be. I\u2019m not sure if Democrats are ready to take on the president and put an end to this never ending nightmare.\n\nMichael Starr Hopkins is the founding partner of Northern Starr Strategies.
