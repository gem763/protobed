Most came from Italy, Spain, Britain and Ireland.\n\nLocal prosecutor Pierre Aurignac told AFP there has been a \"statistical explosion\" of pickpocketing incidents -- from 117 in the first nine months of last year to 274 so far in 2019.\n\n\"It is cash they are after.\"\n\nMost of the thefts happened in the town centre in the shop-lined roads near the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, an area surrounding a shrine.\n\nThe municipality has put up about 50 video cameras since last year, adding to those the Sanctuary itself has installed.\n\n\"These are very organised professionals,\" Subercaze said of the pickpockets. \"They arrive in waves and change all the time. As soon as one is identified or arrested, they are replaced. It is a game of cat and mouse.\"\n\nSlowly but surely, the pilgrims are wising up.\n\n\"A couple had their things stolen a few days ago, so now I take more care,\" said Anna Maria, who came to Lourdes from Naples, Italy.\n\n\"I keep my bag pressed close to my body.\"", "description": "Pilgrims to the holy town of Lourdes in southern France, lulled into carelessness by the promise of heavenly protection, are increasingly falling victim to pickpockets, local authorities say.
