The company's stock remained mostly unchanged immediately after the earnings release but was trading up 2% at about $140 per share on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts called out Azure's revenue growth as a particular bright spot. JPMorgan noted Microsoft Azure's revenue growth for the quarter was higher than Amazon Web Services' at a similar scale.\n\n\"Azure's cloud momentum is still in its early days of playing out with the company's massive installed base,\" the Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Thursday morning. He also spotlighted growth in Office 365 and LinkedIn. \"This combination of dynamics is enabling Nadella to further transform [Microsoft] into a cloud behemoth over the coming years.\"\n\nMicrosoft said Azure revenue grew 59%, but the company doesn't report revenue figures specific to the business. Azure's growth rate dropped from 64% last quarter.\n\nMost analysts seemed unfazed by the slowdown in growth, if they mentioned it at all \u2014 as the revenue base grows, it's likely unsurprising that the rate of growth goes down.\n\nCredit Suisse said Microsoft Azure had a \"slightly faster deceleration in Azure\" than expected but that \"surprise\" growth in server products helped offset it.\n\nMany analysts pointed to Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood's comments on the earnings call that Azure had \"material growth\" in the number of $10 million-plus contracts, though she didn't share specifics.\n\nOppenheimer analysts, in a research note, wrote Microsoft's artificial-intelligence offerings are a \"key driver\" for Azure. Nadella on the earnings call said Azure AI now has more than 20,000 customers and more than 85% of Fortune 100 companies have used it in the past year.\n\n\"We believe [Microsoft's] best-in-class hybrid cloud offerings will help it win market share in cloud,\" Oppenheimer analysts wrote in the note.\n\nAnalysts pointed to risks for Microsoft's future earnings, including cloud infrastructure and application competition from companies including Amazon Web Services and Salesforce.\n\nNadella, meanwhile, in an earnings call on Wednesday laid out his vision for the technologies that will take Microsoft past its $1 trillion valuation, including advancing the company's apps and infrastructure business and focusing on data and artificial intelligence.", "description": "Despite slowing growth in the Azure cloud business, analysts said the company was making the right moves to overtake the leading Amazon Web Services.", "authors": ["Ashley Stewart"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db1d34adee01942af1140b2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
