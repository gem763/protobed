Sivarasu told journalists.\n\nHe added that a post-mortem examination would be carried out to determine the cause of death.\n\nA thermal camera had been used to monitor the child\u2019s temperature while oxygen was supplied through a pipe.\n\nRescuers said the toddler was unconscious but breathing until Sunday morning, but they had been unable to check his condition since then as he had slipped further down.\n\nWorkers used an oil drill to dig a hole parallel to the well, but the rig broke down around 10 metres (33 feet) from the boy because of the rocky ground.\n\nAttempts to use robotic devices to lower ropes to latch onto the boy\u2019s wrist failed on Saturday.\n\nPoliticians had started a vigil at the site and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leader Rahul Gandhi offered their \u201cprayers\u201d in Twitter statements as national attention focussed on Tiruchirappalli.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of incidents involving children falling into disused wells in rural India.\n\nIn June, a two year-old boy died after spending four days trapped inside one in Punjab state.\n\nIn 2006 the rescue of a six-year-old made international headlines when he was recovered safely in Haryana state after being stuck in an 18-metre (60-foot) well for 48 hours.\n\nThe wells are very common across rural India as they are a key source of water for farmers and domestic users.", "description": "New Delhi (AFP) \u2013 The body of a two-year old boy trapped 26-metres (85-feet) down a well in southern India for more than three days was recovered on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/46403c_workers-an-oil-drill-dig-hole-parallel-but-rig-broke-10-metres-33-feet-boy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
