They\u2019re among four people accused of participating in a plan to use hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign money with \u201cRussian roots\u201d to make campaign contributions.\n\nIgor Fruman and Lev Parnas, former associates of Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, also were charged last week in the scheme. They were arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport.\n\nThey worked with Giuliani to press Ukraine for an inquiry into Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictments are semi-connected to an impeachment investigation by House Democrats trying to determine whether Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for action against the Bidens. Refusing Congress-approved aid for personal, political benefit is an impeachable offense, many experts say.\n\nThe indictments stated that Parnas and Fruman donated money and pledged to raise additional funds in 2018 for a candidate who was enlisted to oust former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nFBI agents arrested Correia on Wednesday, accusing him of trying to build political support for a recreational marijuana business in Nevada and other states.", "description": "Oct. 17 (UPI) \u2014 Two men with ties to Rudy Giuliani pleaded not guilty in a New York City court Thursday to charges they were involved in a campaign", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
