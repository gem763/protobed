For starters, he has actually signed a peace deal, agreeing a treaty last year to end Ethiopia\u2019s long-running border conflict with its neighbour Eritrea.\n\nThe war was a vicious one. Tens of thousands were killed, mostly in trench warfare, during the active phase of hostilities from 1998 to 2000.\n\nAlthough the war subsequently evolved into a frozen conflict, fighting along the border flared up periodically and the animosity between the two states spread instability across the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe peace treaty, signed in Saudi Arabia in September last year, was almost entirely down to Mr Abiy\u2019s efforts. Promising to \u201cbuild a bridge of love\u201d across the border, he flew to Asmara, the Eritrean capital, offering reconciliation and partnership.\n\nIsaias Afwerki, the Eritrean dictator, had no choice but to respond. Diplomatic relations were restored. Flights and phone connections between the two countries resumed. The border was re-opened, allowing families to be reunited for the first time in two decades.\n\nEritrean President Isaias Afwerki was welcomed by Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed when he visited the country in July 2018 Credit: AP Photo Mulugeta Ayene, File More\n\nEritrea was not alone in feeling Mr Abiy\u2019s magic touch. In the 18 months since he came to office last year, he has transformed his own country, not long ago one of the most repressive in Africa.\n\nHe lifted a ban on opposition parties, freed thousands of political prisoners and put officials accused of torture on trial.\n\nHe also dismantled a brutal regime in Ethiopia\u2019s Somali region, putting former detainees in power while the governor who tormented them was detained and charged. Regional rebels swiftly laid down their weapons in response.\n\nTo achieve all this, though he probably would not like the comparison, Mr Abiy had to behave like an Ethiopian Donald Trump. In order to maintain momentum and stop the bureaucracy bogging him down, he rode roughshod over the old guard and by-passed ministries.\n\nOfficials rarely knew what the prime minister would do next. Even his foreign ministry reportedly did not know Mr Abiy was in Eritrea until officials read about in on social media. In effect, the prime minister was draining the establishment swamp.\n\nYet it could all misfire. Mr Abiy has earned himself plenty of enemies. He has already escaped an assassination attempt. By loosening the grasp of the state, he has effectively allowed ethnic violence to surge in parts of the country.\n\nEarlier this month, 20 people were killed in the north during clashes between special forces and an ethnic militia. Such episodes have become common and some fret that Ethiopia could even disintegrate.\n\nPeace with Eritrea might not hold either. Mr Isaias needs confrontation with Ethiopia to justify his repressive policies, in particular conscription. Without warning or explanation, the Eritrean president has again closed the border, probably because tens of thousands of his own people fled across it.\n\nIt comes as no surprise, therefore, that the Nobel Committee did not nominate Mr Isaias to share Friday\u2019s peace prize.\n\nAnd in naming Mr Abiy instead, the committee may believe it has shored up his increasingly vulnerable domestic position. Old regime diehards are itching to oust the prime minister. The international opprobrium they would face by forcibly overthrowing a Nobel peace laureate might just prompt them to think twice.", "description": "The Nobel Committee\u2019s decision to award its Peace Prize to Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, marks a return to tradition.
