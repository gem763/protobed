Truman Carrier Strike Group are deploying without their carrier and accompanying air wing after the flattop suffered an unexpected electrical problem that required maintenance, the Navy revealed Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe destroyers USS Lassen, USS Farragut, and USS Forrest Sherman, along with the cruiser USS Normandy, will set sail from their homeports in Norfolk, Virginia, and Mayport, Florida, in the near future. These ships will be accompanied by helicopters from Helicopter Maritime Squadron 72 out of Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. The USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, however, will remain behind.\n\nThe move is unusual. Normally, if an carrier is down for maintenance or some other reason, it will simply be replaced with another carrier. But, the East Coast carrier fleet is currently short a suitable alternative in the inventory due to maintenance backlogs and delivery delays.\n\nIn late August, the Truman aircraft carrier experienced an \"electrical malfunction within the ship's electrical distribution system requiring analysis and repair,\" US Fleet Forces Command spokesman Capt. Scott Miller told USNI News, which first reported the news of both the electrical issue and the unusual deployment.\n\nUS 2nd Fleet Commander Vice Adm. Andrew Lewis characterized the latest developments as \"unfortunate\" in a talks with USNI News. \"The situation with Truman frankly is unfortunate,\" he told the naval affairs outlet. \"Obviously, we're working really hard to fix it, and we will fix it, but it's unfortunate \u2014 nobody wanted that to happen certainly.\"\n\nThe Navy said Thursday that \"repairs are progressing and all efforts are being made to deploy the carrier and air wing as soon as possible.\" But, as there are still a number of unknowns surrounding the issue, it is unclear when the Truman will again be ready to sail.\n\nRead more: 259 US military crews have refueled at the closest airport to Trump's struggling Scottish luxury resort just this year\n\n\"Not having the aircraft carrier,\" Lewis explained to USNI News, \"it does detract from the symbolism and the deterrent effect, no question.\"\n\n\"The aircraft carrier is a behemoth beast with an amazing capability that, it shows up off your shores, and if you're not our friend you become our friend quickly if you know what's good for you. There is no question that that effect is lost with smaller ships.\"\n\nThe deploying ships have formed a Surface Action Group, and the admiral insists that these ships bring the kind of capability to confront both low- and high-end threats.\n\nExplaining that the ships have anti-submarine, air-and-missile defense, and strike warfare capabilities, he insisted that this is a \"very capable group\" that is ready \"to do the nation's bidding in this great power competition,\" an apparent reference to 2nd Fleet's role in confronting a resurgent Russia.", "description": "Four escort ships of the Harry S.
