At center stage are front-runners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Another top-tier candidate, Bernie Sanders, is back just two weeks after suffering a heart attack and suspending his campaigning.\n\nIt could be the last 2020 presidential debate for some candidates. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard have not yet met fundraising and polling thresholds to participate in the November debate.\n\nAlso participating are California Sen. Kamala Harris, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and billionaire activist Tom Steyer.\n\n___\n\n4:50 p.m.\n\nA trio of Iowa officials is criticizing the Democratic National Committee for instituting polling and fundraising thresholds to participate in the presidential debates, complaining they\u2019re artificially winnowing the field of candidates and usurping the job of Iowa caucusgoers.\n\nIowa Attorney General Tom Miller and Iowa DNC member Jan Bauer said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday that most Iowans are not tuning into the Democratic presidential debates and have not yet made up their minds.\n\nThe call was organized by Montana Gov. Steve Bullock\u2019s presidential campaign. Bullock has failed to make the stage for recent debates, including Tuesday\u2019s in Ohio.\n\nMiller and Bauer have endorsed Bullock.\n\nFormer Iowa Democratic Party Chair and former U.S. Rep. Dave Nagle said the DNC is shutting out those without access to wealth or name recognition.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nDemocrats are confronting a rapidly shifting political landscape as a dozen candidates meet on Tuesday for the most crowded presidential debate in modern history.\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry that has put President Donald Trump on the offensive has also reordered the political calculus for Democrats, especially Joe Biden. The former vice president is facing baseless \u2014 but persistent \u2014 allegations of wrongdoing overseas from Trump and his allies.\n\nHis early front-runner status is also under threat from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. But as she rises, Warren is also fending off new questions about her biography.\n\nAdding to the drama, Bernie Sanders is recovering from a heart attack that raised questions about his ability to withstand a campaign and about who might win his support if he had to drop out.", "description": "WESTERVILLE, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the fourth Democratic presidential debate (all times local): 8 p.m. The fourth debate of the Democratic", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/ba6895_election-2020-debate-66495-stage-is-prepared-cnn-new-york-times-host-democratic-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
