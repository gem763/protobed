Shocked Brazilians shared the image of \u00c1gatha F\u00e9lix online after she was shot in the back in a Rio de Janeiro favela on Friday night by what residents said was a bullet from a police officer\u2019s rifle. She later died in hospital.\n\nShe was the fifth young child to be killed in Rio favelas this year. Favela activists, politicians, the public defenders\u2019 office and the president of Rio\u2019s bar association blamed the shoot-to-kill policy of the Rio governor, Wilson Witzel. \u201cHe is responsible for the murder,\u201d tweeted Guilherme Boulos, a leftist politician.\n\nAn ally of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, Witzel was elected last year after promising a \u201cslaughter\u201d of drug gangsters. On Saturday, as hundreds demonstrated in anger in the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o favela where \u00c1gatha was shot, the hashtag #aculpaedowitzel (it\u2019s Witzel\u2019s fault) led trending topics in Brazil. Others shared cartoons showing the smiling governor wiping blood from his face.\n\nOn Sunday the favela newspaper Voz das Comunidades organised a second demonstration. Led by beeping motorbike taxis, children waved yellow balloons as a small crowd marched behind a banner reading: \u201cStop killing us.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrators walked through the rain chanting \u201cWe demand justice for \u00c1gatha\u201d towards a nearby cemetery for her funeral.\n\n\u201cThis is the death of a child whose only sin in her life was being poor. Why is the state security policy an extermination policy?\u201d Luciano Bandeira, the president of Rio\u2019s bar association, told O Globo newspaper. \u201cThere is no remorse, no admission of fault, no will to rethink the policy to avoid other deaths like this happening.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u00c1gatha F\u00e9lix died after being shot in the back. Photograph: Instagram\n\n\u00c1gatha was travelling with her mother, Vanessa Sales, in one of the vans that serve as public transport in the winding lanes of the sprawling favela when she was shot in the back. Police said they responded to an attack from gang members. Residents said there was no gun battle; a police officer had fired at two men on a motorbike and hit the girl instead.\n\n\u201cEveryone said the shot came from the police, there was no confrontation,\u201d said Thain\u00e3 de Medeiros, a member of the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o\u2019s Papo Reto collective, which documents police violence.\n\n\u201cA motorbike passed and he tried to hit it and hit the van. The space was very short, six to seven metres. The shot went through the van, it went through \u00c1gatha\u2019s body,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of a genocidal policy, of genocide of black people.\u201d\n\nIn July, Witzel compared drug gangs that control favelas such as Complexo do Alem\u00e3o to terrorist groups in an interview with foreign journalists and defended his declaration that it was better to shoot armed gang members in the head. \u201cA bandit with a rifle is a terrorist. How do you treat terrorists? With lethality,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, who has said he plans to stand for president in 2022, has yet to comment publicly. Instead on Sunday he tweeted congratulations to the Rio town of S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo on its 129th anniversary. In a statement, his government said it \u201cprofoundly regretted\u201d her death, that police came under simultaneous attacks on Friday night in the favela and \u201cresponded to the aggression\u201d.\n\nOutside the hospital where \u00c1gatha died on Friday, her distraught grandfather Ailton F\u00e9lix challenged this version of events in an impassioned speech captured by television cameras.\n\n'Caught defenseless in the crossfire': Rio families cope with deaths by police violence Read more\n\n\u201cHer mother was there and saw there was no confrontation \u2026 They shot at the van and killed my granddaughter. That was it. This is a confrontation? Was my granddaughter armed by any chance to get shot?\u201d he said. \u201cShe was studious. She didn\u2019t live on the street.\u201d\n\nPolice said they would not change policy, pointing to a 21% fall in homicides across the state from January to August compared with 2018. \u201cWe will not back down. The state government is on the right track,\u201d the police spokesman Mauro Fliess told TV Globo.\n\nPedro Strozenberg, the ombudsman for Rio\u2019s public defenders\u2019 office, said that this came at too high a price. From January to August, 1,249 people in Rio state were killed by police officers \u2013 16% more than the previous year.\n\nWitzel\u2019s policy \u201ckills people involved [in crime] in the community and people who are not involved\u201d, he said. His office also lamented the death of Leonardo dos Santos, a police officer killed last Thursday in nearby Niter\u00f3i, as evidence that \u201cconfrontation has proved inefficient\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators in Complexo do Alem\u00e3o favela. Photograph: Dominic Phillips/The Guardian\n\nComplexo do Alem\u00e3o residents at the demonstration on Sunday called onWitzel to end the violence. \u201cWhen there is a death ... it takes us to our limits, psychologically,\u201d said Camila Santos, 34, who blamed Witzel for \u201clegalising and legitimising\u201d police violence against favela residents.\n\nLater she led a prayer before Marcos Lopes, 34, a motorbike taxi driver, grabbed the microphone and began singing a popular favela rap song. Others joined in. \u201cI just want to be happy, and walk peacefully in the favela where I was born,\u201d they sang.\n\nAdilson Santiago, 54, a drainage worker, watched as the demonstration passed. \u201cThe police of Rio de Janeiro have to respect people of favelas like Complexo do Alem\u00e3o more,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of innocent people inside.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds protest over killing of \u00c1gatha F\u00e9lix, eight, allegedly shot in back by police bullet in favela", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53eac99aa31f025f22619a80fcd9c2515899f42/0_267_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c765da2018a5de796d4961bca9c5e09", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
