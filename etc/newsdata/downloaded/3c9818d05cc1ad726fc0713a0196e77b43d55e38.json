Some of the most vociferous and effective opponents of legalizing suicide by doctor are members of the disability rights community, organizations such as Not Dead Yet. Disability rights activists, generally stated, are secular in their approach, not pro-life about abortion, and politically liberal.\n\nPeople with disabilities see themselves targeted by the euthanasia movement, and indeed, note that that the reasons given for permitting terminally ill people to access lethal prescriptions \u2014 a limitation on access that is not shared in most other jurisdictions where euthanasia/assisted suicide are legal \u2014 deal with issues that people with disabilities face in their everyday lives. The idea \u2014 their fear \u2014 is that society is coming to accept the noxious idea that life with disabilities is not worth living.\n\nNow, the National Council on Disability \u2014 an independent agency of the federal government \u2014 has issued a powerful report on the dangers to people with disabilities of legalizing assisted. It withers the mendacious and ubiquitous claims by proponents that \u201cguidelines will protect against abuse.\u201d From The Danger of Assisted Suicide Laws:\n\nAssisted suicide laws contain provisions intended to safeguard patients from problems or abuse. However, research for this report showed that these provisions are ineffective, and often fail to protect patients in a variety of ways, including:\n\nInsurers have denied expensive, life- sustaining medical treatment but offered to subsidize lethal drugs, potentially leading patients toward hastening their own deaths.\n\nMisdiagnoses of terminal disease can also cause frightened patients to hasten their deaths.\n\nPeople with the disability of depression are subject to harm where assisted suicide is legal.\n\nDemoralization in people with disabilities is often based on internalized oppression, such as being conditioned to regard help as undignified and burdensome, or to regard disability as an inherent impediment to quality of life. Demoralization can also result from the lack of options that people depend on. These problems can lead patients toward hastening their deaths\u2014 and doctors who conflate disability with terminal illness or poor quality of life are ready to help them. Moreover, most health professionals lack training and experience in working with people with disabilities, so they don\u2019t know how to recognize and intervene in this type of demoralization.\n\nFinancial and emotional pressures can distort patient choice.\n\nAssisted suicide laws apply the lowest culpability standard possible to doctors, medical staff, and all other involved parties, that of a good- faith belief that the law is being followed, which creates the potential for abuse.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more in the report that should be read and pondered by anyone who believes assisted suicide culture can exist without flaw, abuse, oppression, or deleterious cultural change.\n\nBottom line: If you accept the idea that killing is an acceptable answer to human suffering, the \u201csuffering\u201d that justifies killing will continually expand and/or result in hastened death becoming the preferred means of dying. If you doubt me, witness the blatant cheerleading for for the death agenda by an in-the-assisted-suicide-tank media, including glowing reports about \u201csuicide going away parties.\u201d\n\nThose with eyes to see, let them see.", "description": "The National Council on Disability has issued a powerful report on the dangers to people with disabilities of legalizing assisted.", "authors": ["Wesley J.
