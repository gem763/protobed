Even the 51-page guide to Japanese manners and customs the local organising committee distributed to visiting officials and journalists before this Rugby World Cup. It includes all sorts of hints and titbits like \u201cmake sure you don\u2019t have holes in your socks\u201d (page 19) and \u201cmany consider it impolite to sit with legs crossed and one foot pointing towards another person in the room\u201d (p24) and \u201cyou may be greeted with a handshake, or you may be greeted with a traditional Japanese bow, do not attempt to do both at the same time\u201d (p23). But \u2013 and I\u2019ve been through it three times now \u2013 it has nothing on the correct etiquette for handling the animals in one of Tokyo\u2019s new micropig cafes.\n\nAre England or France happy to lose Pool C decider to avoid the All Blacks? | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nTurns out that while you\u2019re very welcome to stroke and pat the micropigs scuttling around your feet, you should never try to pick them up because they are scared of heights. Like so many of the mistakes you can make in Japan, you\u2019ll figure out this one the very minute after you\u2019ve committed it, because the pig will squeal loudly. So, now you know. Be warned though, because, as Peter Carey writes in his book Wrong About Japan, after a particularly humiliating encounter in which he tried to impress an interviewee with his half-baked theories about manga, \u201chalf knowledge is sometimes much worse than complete ignorance\u201d.\n\nKnowing that it is rude to put your towel in the water at the public baths, for instance, only makes it that much more embarrassing when you accidentally do. And since the only spares are kept back by the front desk, there\u2019s no way out that won\u2019t leave you feeling awfully soggy and sheepish.\n\nSo far, after nine matches in six cities, five of them in the space of just seven days, and three thousand-odd miles of air, road and rail travel, the World Cup has been a beginner\u2019s course in the all the many mistakes you can make while navigating your way around Japan. You might think that if you\u2019ve tackled the London rush hour on a regular basis you can cope with anything the Tokyo subway can throw at you in the morning. But the third time you get elbowed aside by the little old lady you were trying to let by you realise that this is an entirely different, and far more vicious proposition, one which only a lunatic would attempt while carrying a large backpack and suitcase.\n\nAnd you may know that it is essential to have a well thought-out karaoke strategy, that the classic English technique of getting hammered and singing badly isn\u2019t going to cut it after your host has just knocked out a near-note-perfect Sinatra number. Best, then, to consider your limitations while you\u2019re still sober and pick out a selection of well-known songs that you\u2019re quite sure fall within your vocal range. I was talking about exactly that with a colleague from another newspaper just the other night. He\u2019d been thinking about it and had settled on \u201csomething by Johnny Cash\u201d. Perfect. \u201cNow why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d I thought to myself, jealously.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nThe only problem was, we discovered together later that same evening, that it doesn\u2019t much matter what you think you want to sing if someone else is controlling the karaoke machine. We\u2019d blundered into the same biker bar \u2013 \u201cthis place looks interesting\u201d \u2013 as half of the local rugby team, and their big winger, who\u2019d smacked the microphone down on the table in what felt less like an invitation and more like an order, wasn\u2019t impressed by my friend\u2019s suggestion. \u201cJohnnycash?\u201d he repeated back to us incredulously. He rolled it all into one word, which made it sound even more ludicrous. \u201cJohnnycash!\u201d his teammate, the No 8, repeated, and they both fell about laughing.\n\nIt seemed to be one of the funniest things they\u2019d ever heard. The funniest, for sure, that either of us two Englishmen had said all night, even if we had no idea exactly what the joke was. The big winger bluntly insisted that we instead attempt I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys, and then I Don\u2019t Want To Miss A Thing by Aerosmith. We butchered them both, which was less amusing. They grinned awkwardly. \u201cSmiling not only indicates happiness,\u201d I noted later, looking in that World Rugby handbook, \u201cbut is also used to hide unpleasant emotions in public\u201d (p24).\n\nFor the most part, though, the half a million rugby fans here all seem to be muddling along just fine. There haven\u2019t been any major scandals so far, at any rate. There was a small upset about the fact that ITV\u2019s pundits were wearing shoes on the tatami mats in their TV studio. And one English journalist ended up in the local papers because he wore his swimming trunks into the hot springs, and then got called out on it by Joe Marler in one of the England team\u2019s press conferences. \u201cApparently you lot have offended the Japanese culture,\u201d Marler said, with some glee. \u201cIt says specifically no shorts. I wore a vest to cover my tatts, and socks, but nothing here. Because I didn\u2019t want to offend them. And yet you\u2019re swanning about the place in swim shorts, it\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d\n\nRugby World Cup pool permutations: who needs what in the last week?
