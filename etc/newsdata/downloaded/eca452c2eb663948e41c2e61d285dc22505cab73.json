The drone seeks out target drones, identifies them, and then asks an operator's permission to attack.\n\nAnduril cofounder and CEO Brian Schimpf said the Interceptor weighs roughly the same amount as a bowling ball, and can go 90 to 100 mph.\n\n\"The only thing that can take out a swarm of fast drones is a bigger swarm of faster drones, and that's exactly what we're building,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nA render of Anduril's Interceptor drone.

Luckey has maintained that he was fired for his right-wing views, suggesting that a donation he made to a pro-Trump group which put up posters mocking Hillary Clinton could have been behind the firing. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a congressional hearing that Luckey's political views had nothing to do with his dismissal.\n\nAnduril received funding last month which bumped its valuation up to $1 billion.", "description": "The new 'Interceptor' drone weighs about as much as a bowling ball and is capable of smashing other drones out of the sky.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d95e205e28ccd1a693e1efc?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
