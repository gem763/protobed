Stassi Schroeder is taking a break from Vanderpump Rules costar Kristen Doute\n\nSchroeder initially tip-toed around the issue during the podcast with Comedian and Write Danny Pellegrino, afraid that if she gave up too much information about the upcoming season that Bravo would fire her.\n\n'Obviously you know I can't f**ing say anything, but obviously everyone's instincts are right,' she said before Pellegrino interrupted.\n\n'Viewers instincts are right with \"Maybe Kristen's an a**hole, guys,\"' he interjected while Schroeder tried to find her words.\n\n'With just some of us, not all of us,' Schroeder replied.\n\nCutting ties: 'I\u2019m prepared to look like the a\u2014hole, but whatever it is, I\u2019m like, \"Listen, I have to take care of my own mental and emotional health first,\"' Schroeder admitted during an episode of her Straight Up With Stassi podcast (pictured in Los Angles on July 30)\n\nFrenimies?

I absolutely do. Sometimes you just can\u2019t be in the same room with someone without wanting to kill them,' she said.\n\nYikes: 'It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about her. I absolutely do. Sometimes you just can\u2019t be in the same room with someone without wanting to kill them,' Stassi said (pictured in Los Angeles on June 15)\n\nPellegrino, a fellow podcaster who focuses on reality TV, knew that Schroeder had recently filmed the opening title scene, which features two to three people at a time in close proximity.\n\nWhen asked if filming the opening sequence was awkward, given all the drama, Schroeder responded flatly: 'Yes.'\n\nPellegrino also mentioned that Doute had notably been missing from an important event in Schroeder's life: her July engagement party.\n\nHer mother, Dayna Schroeder, added fuel to the fire when she responded to a comment about Doute's absence on Instagram.\n\n'Dayna were you sad Kristen wasn\u2019t there? I know you two are close! [heart emoji] congrats' a fan wrote.\n\n'Yes, quite sad,' the mom responded, continuing, 'But I didn\u2019t really know all the particulars. So, I was out of the loop for awhile. Don\u2019t you worry, it\u2019s like Lion King and the circle of life. .\u2026 each one of these girls will grow, change and come back to their original strong friendship bond that they\u2019ve always had.
