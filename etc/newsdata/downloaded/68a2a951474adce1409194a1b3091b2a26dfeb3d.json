Women say: let\u2019s stick to our mission, let\u2019s stick to our values,\u201d Ma said.\n\nHe added that he began succession planning when Alibaba was 5 years old.\n\nHe said the company \u201cshould never depend on Jack Ma\u201d.\n\nAnalysts may have numerous theories about how Chinese giant Alibaba became successful, but for co-founder Jack Ma, the answer is clear and simple: women.\n\n\u201cThirty-four per cent of the senior leadership of Alibaba is women. That\u2019s the secret sauce of Alibaba\u2019s success,\u201d the retired CEO said at a dialogue session during the Forbes CEO Conference in Singapore on Tuesday (Oct 15).\n\nCalling the past 20 years \u201ca terrible period\u201d for the company, Ma said Alibaba had weathered the rough patch thanks to female employees who stayed with the company to \u201cfight for the things they believe in\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to convince women of your vision and mission and values. Very difficult,\u201d the billionaire said. \u201cBut when you successfully convince women (of) the vision, mission, they stick to it; they are loyal to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen? Easy come, easy go,\u201d he quipped, to laughter and applause from the audience.\n\nRead also: After Alibaba, Jack Ma\u2019s next project could be creating schools that teach children how to \u2018be human\u2019\n\nMa added women had, at one point, accounted for 47 per cent of the tech firm\u2019s workforce. This figure has since fallen following the acquisition of several male-dominated companies, but the former head said he expected it to rise again.\n\n\u201cMen, when they\u2019re under pressure, they talk about profit, they talk about competition,\u201d Ma continued. \u201cWomen say: let\u2019s stick to our mission, let\u2019s stick to our values.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always say that behind every successful man, there\u2019s a successful woman, a powerful woman. I have a lot of powerful women standing behind me, and I\u2019m always thankful.\u201d\n\nRead also: Almost half of Google\u2019s management team is made up of women \u2014 here they are\n\nCalling computers \u201ccold\u201d, the philanthropist added that he believed the people running them should be warm, kindhearted and careful.\n\n\u201cWomen do better jobs (in this regard),\u201d he continued. \u201cWomen care for others much more than men.\u201d\n\nMa raised the example of how Alibaba\u2019s female shoppers \u2013 who comprise 60 per cent of its customer base \u2013 often purchased items for husbands, parents, and children.\n\n\u201cMen only buy for themselves,\u201d he added, to more laughter and applause.\n\n\u201cI believe that in the 21st century, if we have more women leaders, the world will be much more peaceful,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also: The billionaire CEO of Uniqlo \u2014 and the richest person in Japan \u2014 says a woman would be the best person to take over his job\n\nJack Ma started succession planning after 5 years as CEO\n\nMa performing on stage at his retirement party during Alibaba\u2019s 20th anniversary .

But not today.\u2019 Because the company was in trouble,\u201d Ma told an enraptured audience.\n\n\u201c(I said) \u2018One day, I\u2019ll leave\u2019. And that day, I started thinking: Who is the right person who can do better than I? That day, I started to think: I should prepare for my retirement,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThat day I decided: my 20 year (work) anniversary \u2013 September 10, 2019 \u2013 would be the day I leave.\u201d\n\nRead also: Inside Jack Ma\u2019s 60,000-person retirement party, which was held in an Olympic stadium and featured employee performances that made Ma cry\n\nThe business magnate spent a year developing a system to discover and train the \u201cright\u201d future leaders for the company, which he said was inspired by various parliamentary systems, including the US\u2019 and ancient Rome\u2019s.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s system let staff step up and fight for the company\u2019s mission, vision, and values, and had since created \u201ca lot of leaders\u201d, including current CEO Zhang and vice president Eric Pelletier, Ma added.\n\nRead also: Meet Daniel Zhang, the workaholic who\u2019s succeeding Jack Ma as Alibaba\u2019s chairman and keeps such a low profile that he was once mistaken for a janitor in the company\u2019s headquarters\n\nHe also warned companies not to depend on a single leader to survive, but on systems, culture and people \u2013 a lesson he learned by studying \u201cgreat companies\u201d in Japan and the US.\n\n\u201cYou should never have a copy of Jack Ma.
