It is a hypothetical question. It is up to the members of our party to decide who the leader is.\n\n'John gave an answer to an interview that he undertook. My answer is this: I am leading this party to go into an election.'\n\nHowever, Ms Long-Bailey, regarded as Mr McDonnell's choice for the next leader, took a rather different stance when she appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.\n\n'I think that it would fantastic for the next Labour leader to be a woman\u2026it's a hypothetical situation at the moment,' she said.\n\n'We're fighting for a general election to elect Jeremy Corbyn as our Prime Minister and we think we're in touching distance of that, but I think it's right for John to say that in the event of us losing an election that they would stand aside.\n\n'That is convention within the party that's usually what happens.'\n\nIn his interview with GQ last week, Mr McDonnell said he did not believe Mr Corbyn could stay on after another election defeat,\n\n'I think it is the same for my own personal position, I can't see so,' he said. 'What we'd do is as the tradition, which is have an election for a new leader.\n\n'I'm still of the view now that whoever comes after Jeremy has got to be a woman. We've got to have a woman leader. If you look at the new youngsters that have come through, they are fantastic.'", "description": "Amid mounting evidence that he is losing his grip on the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn insisted he would not engage in 'hypotheticals' about his future.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/14/19653778-0-image-a-5_1570973835146.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
