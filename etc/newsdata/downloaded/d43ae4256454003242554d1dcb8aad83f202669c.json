The first-time host covered a range of subject manner spanning sex addiction, women\u2019s needs, and the ever-present reality of human genitalia. On psychopaths: \u201cThey\u2019re really having a moment, aren\u2019t they?\u201d On why Hot Priest was hot: \u201cBecause he was doing this one thing: listening.\u201d On people\u2019s genitals: \u201cThey\u2019re just sitting there.\u201d One can only imagine the countless children up past their bedtimes watching SNL, blessed with this new knowledge about feminism, politics, and the human body.
