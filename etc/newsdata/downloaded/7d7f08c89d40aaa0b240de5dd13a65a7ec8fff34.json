Biden is a 2020 Democratic frontrunner and one of Trump's chief political rivals.\n\nThe phone call is the subject of an explosive whistleblower complaint that a US intelligence official filed against the president in August. In addition to accusing Trump of abusing his power and violating federal law, it says Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is a \"central figure\" in Trump's effort and that Attorney General William Barr \"appears to be involved as well.\"\n\nTrump and his allies have attacked the whistleblower, suggesting the individual is disloyal to the US and committed espionage against Trump, despite the fact that they followed the law when filing their complaint. The president has also repeatedly called for the whistleblower's identity to become public.\n\nA White House summary of the call confirms the main details of the complaint, and Trump's handpicked spy chief testified to Congress that the complaint is \"in alignment\" with the memo.\n\nThe intelligence community watchdog, moreover, deemed the complaint to be \"urgent\" and \"credible.\" Last week, Trump confirmed the complaint's central allegation \u2014 that he wanted a foreign government to investigate a political opponent \u2014 when he publicly called for both Ukraine and China to look into the Bidens.\n\nIn his letter to the House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry, Cipollone accused them of taking action that \"violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent.\"\n\n\"For example, you have denied the President the right to cross-examine witnesses, to call witnesses, to receive transcripts of testimony, to have access to evidence, to have counsel present, and many other basic rights guaranteed to all Americans,\" he wrote.\n\n\"You have conducted your proceedings in secret,\" he continued. \"You have violated civil liberties and the separation of powers by threatening Executive Branch officials, claiming that you will seek to punish those who exercise fundamental constitutional rights and prerogatives.\"\n\nCipollone went on to argue that in order to validate the impeachment inquiry, Democrats need to give Republican ranking members the authority to unilaterally issue subpoenas.\n\nThe White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, also said in a statement that the executive branch \u2014 which includes the White House, State Department, and Justice Department \u2014 would not cooperate with the investigation as a general rule.\n\n\"The Executive Branch cannot be expected to, and will not participate in, this exercise of partisan political theater,\" Grisham said.", "description": "The White House told House Democrats it wouldn't be cooperating with them on their impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth", "Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9319432e22af34b70b82ec?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
