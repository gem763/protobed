USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After suffering a heart attack last week, Vermont senator and 2020 Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders will no longer be participating in a televised LGBTQ town hall on Thursday, according to CNN.\n\n\"Senator Sanders is feeling great after his operation but is trying to prioritize which events are the best fit in his schedule at this time,\" deputy campaign manager Arianna Jones told USA TODAY.\n\nThe 2020 presidential hopeful felt chest discomfort during a campaign event in Las Vegas last week and had a blockage in one artery. Two stents were inserted, his campaign said last week, and he was released from Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center on Friday.\n\nHis doctors said Sanders\u2019 \u201chospital course was uneventful with good expected progress.\u201d\n\nI want to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff at the Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center for the excellent care that they provided. After two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work. pic.twitter.com/HjBc9LPjo4 \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 4, 2019\n\nSanders, 78, was seen walking about his neighborhood in Burlington, Vermont, with his wife, Jane, Monday, and told reporters he'd be back on the campaign trail \"soon.\" He said on Sunday that he was \u201cglad to be home in Burlington to rest for a little bit\u201d and is \u201crecovering well and feeling much better.\u201d\n\n.\u2066@BernieSanders\u2069 and his wife, Jane, took a walk around their neighborhood in Burlington, VT in the rain.

But he has cancelled some other campaign events since his heart attack.\n\nCNN and LGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign announced at the end of CNN's 7-hour forum on climate change that they would be partnering to host the Thursday town hall.\n\nThe event focused on LGBT issues comes after Trump administration policies that have banned transgender Americans from serving in the military, prohibited embassies from flying rainbow flags during Pride Month and rolled back certain Obama-era nondiscrimination protections.\n\nSanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, has been consistently among the top three Democratic contenders in the large field. He currently stands in third place in national polling, according to a Real Clear Politics' averaging of major polls.\n\nThe Vermont senator\u2019s health scare has brought age to the forefront of the 2020 race. Sanders is the oldest person running for President.\n\nThe other top democratic contenders are also the oldest. Former Vice President Joe Biden follows Sanders at 76, and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is 70.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is also 73 years old.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci and Aamer Madhani.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/07/bernie-sanders-wont-attend-cnn-lgbtq-town-hall-after-heart-attack/3903074002/", "description": "The Vermont senator was seen walking about his neighborhood in Burlington, with his wife, Jane, Monday, and told reporters he'd be back on the campaign trail \"soon.\"", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
