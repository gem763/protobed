You\u2019d use it for an ice cream from the corner store or you\u2019d save it up until you had enough to buy a new book from the mall. Fast-forward to today, and it seems our kids are getting a whole lot more than ice cream and book money, to the tune of a whopping $40 per week on average.\n\nA new survey published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants found that two-thirds of parents in the U.S. give their kids an allowance with an average weekly amount of $40. Four out of five parents who give an allowance said part of the deal is that the kids must complete chores \u2014 at least an hour of chores per week, with an average of about 5 hours of chore-time.\n\nDoes $40 seem incredibly high to anyone else? The New York Times reported that the average age of a child receiving an allowance in the survey was 14 years old \u2014 and some \u201cchildren\u201d were as old as 25 \u2014 so maybe age has skewed that rate up.\n\nIn contrast, an allowance and chore-tracking app, Rooster Money, conducted a poll of 10,000 users in 2017 and concluded that kids ages 4-14 earned an average of around $13 per week. (Knowing that younger kids usually earn less than older kids, they also tracked the numbers by age; 14-year-olds earned more like $18.)\n\nI\u2019ll tell you if you tell me\n\nMy son gets $5 per week. He does have a handful of chores he\u2019s responsible for, but we do not specifically pay him for those chores \u2014 he has to do them regardless. (I have been known, though, to reduce his allowance $1 at a time if he excessively complains about doing them. Feeding the dog, in particular, is not his favourite use of time.)\n\nOnce in a while, if he\u2019s saving up for something special, he\u2019ll ask to do extra chores to earn money, and I\u2019m ok with that. He\u2019s really good at folding towels, and two loads for a buck is a good deal, as far as we\u2019re both concerned.\n\nWe don\u2019t have any hard and fast rules about how he spends his money (or any extra money he gets for birthdays or holidays), but we\u2019ve always encouraged him to spend some, save some and give some. Larger amounts that he is gifted typically go right into his savings account, which he considers to be his car fund. He divides up smaller amounts for himself (usually Lego sets or Pok\u00e9mon cards) and others (gifts for family members, toys drives around the holidays, etc).\n\nMaybe at $5, I\u2019m erring on the low side, though. John Lanza, author of the book The Art of Allowance, told the New York Times that a good rule of thumb is the child\u2019s age in dollars, per week. Under that guideline, my son would get $9 dollars instead of $5.\n\nYour turn: If you give your kids an allowance, how much do they get? Is the allowance tied specifically to their household chores? Do you have guidelines for how the money can be spent? And how do you decide when it\u2019s time to give them a \u201craise\u201d?", "description": "If you\u2019re like me, you can remember getting a couple of bucks each week as an allowance when you were a kid.
