He isn\u2019t a household name, but his distinctive, creative low-budget genre movies have earned him a strong reputation among the kind of people who can list off a dozen Dario Argento movies without checking the internet. Natali\u2019s 1997 indie movie Cube is a particular case in point: a low-budget Canadian science fiction film about a group of strangers who wake up trapped in a prison shaped like a seemingly endless maze of cube-shaped rooms. His 2013 movie Haunter takes a similarly claustrophobic approach to a very different story, as a dead girl (Abigail Breslin) haunting a house she can\u2019t escape begins dealing with the weird supernatural phenomena around her. Natali got to work on a larger canvas in 2009 with Splice, a flawed but ambitious \u201cdangers of science\u201d movie starring Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley as researchers who unwisely create a sentient animal-human hybrid, which naturally rebels against them.\n\nMost recently, Natali has been working in television, directing episodes of Orphan Black, Hannibal, American Gods, and Westworld, among other shows. But he\u2019s returned to filmmaking with the Netflix project In the Tall Grass, an adaptation of a novella co-written by Stephen King and King\u2019s son, horror writer Joe Hill. The film expands significantly on the novella, which features a brother and sister venturing into a country field to try to save a child, then discovering the supernatural powers and malign intentions of the area that\u2019s trapped him. When Natali came to 2019\u2019s Fantastic Fest to premiere In the Tall Grass, I sat down with him to talk about directing his first Netflix film, why he keeps making movies about enclosed spaces and trapped people, why horror fans love practical effects, how technology is changing low-budget horror, and how he went about making grass scary.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nHow did this project start? Did Netflix court you, or did you go to them?\n\nMy producing partner Steve Hoban and myself came to Netflix. I\u2019ve had the script for quite a while, and there had been some discussion with them a few years prior, and it didn\u2019t really take off. And then there was this moment where Stephen King suddenly entered the larger consciousness again, with the It film, and we felt like we should try again. At the same time, Netflix had just released two original Stephen King movies, which are both quite good: 1922 and Gerald\u2019s Game. They were interested in doing another one, so they got this crazy script from us, and for some reason, they said yes.\n\nHad you already negotiated the rights with King?\n\nHe has a pro forma deal that, as I understand it, everybody gets. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, where you are within the industry. First, he has to approve you. Then you option his work for $1. So it\u2019s very cheap, but you have to meet certain benchmarks in terms of writing the script, getting into the marketplace, and so on. And he has a lot of approval over the material and the casting, etc. But he and Joe Hill, his son who co-wrote this novella, are very deferential to the filmmakers. Never, not once, did they exercise that control. I was encouraged to just make my own movie. I think he understands that adaptation shouldn\u2019t be literal. And it certainly couldn\u2019t be in this case. So it was a real pleasure. They\u2019re very collaborative and easy.\n\nThis is an extensive expansion from the original novella. Did you consult with them on it at all?\n\nI just wrote the scripts and gave it to them, and they approved them. To be honest, I don\u2019t even know if they read them or not. I grew up reading Stephen King, so it was actually terrifying for me to write the script and submit it knowing he might actually read it. But for whatever reason, they kept saying yes, and we kept going. I actually wanted to be very faithful to the story. But I knew I would have to expand upon the story. There\u2019s dialogue from the story in the movie, it\u2019s quite faithful, but where the story ends, the movie just keeps going. I was constantly dipping back into the story for details and elements, and I didn\u2019t really invent characters or locations. It\u2019s all there; it\u2019s all latent in the original material.\n\nIt reminded me a fair bit of your films Cube and Haunter in that you\u2019re extensively exploring a single nearly homogenous environment in expansive ways, finding all the possibilities. Horror requires isolation, but is there something specific that interests you in the theme of infinite variations on a specific isolated place?\n\nI think it\u2019s twofold. The highfalutin answer to that question is, I grew up in an apartment complex in Toronto, a city where it\u2019s very cold, and you spend a lot of time indoors. The idea of isolation and containment \u2014 this is me psychoanalyzing myself \u2014 may be part of my psychological makeup. The less highfalutin answer is, I don\u2019t have a lot of money to make my movies, so I have no choice but to tell stories that involve only a few characters and locations because that\u2019s all I can afford.\n\nBut often, limitations are inspiring. I\u2019m cognizant of that when I\u2019m taking on these projects. I do think, as a filmmaker, there\u2019s something exciting about it because it\u2019s sort of like a symphony where you have a central theme, but you do variations. There\u2019s a certain excitement in watching those kinds of films to see how the filmmaker can keep spinning those plates, and doing new variations on the same idea. It does give you license as a filmmaker to be more eccentric and explore unusual possibilities because you\u2019ve already grounded the audience in a location. In the case of Tall Grass, I was very clear from the outset that we would present a real, believable, \u201cnormal\u201d world. And then, gradually, as our characters enter this environment, we\u2019d break it down, until, by the end of the movie, things are pretty surrealistic. There\u2019s a visual progression and a filmic progression that follows it.\n\nPeople keep describing the film as Lovecraftian, but that\u2019s becoming an increasingly common label for any kind of uncanny horror. Is H.P. Lovecraft a specific inspiration for you? How do you feel about the urge to label so much horror as Lovecraftian?\n\nI actually do see him as an influence, and I bet Stephen King and Joe Hill do, too. I certainly know Lovecraft had a big influence on Stephen King. In this case, we have a kind of Lovecraftian god that is, for lack of a better word, our central evil. And \u201cLovecraftian\u201d makes sense because it\u2019s ancient, and its existence likely predates mankind, which is a common tenet in Lovecraft\u2019s work.\n\nSo I don\u2019t resist the label in this case. What I think is really powerful about Lovecraft, and what makes him a difficult writer to adapt, is that he rarely has the reader confront precisely what is frightening in the story, and he rarely explains or describes it. He\u2019ll only allude to it. It\u2019s an enigmatic kind of horror. I find that really alluring, fascinating, and frightening. Partly, it\u2019s because when you can\u2019t see something, your imagination tends to fill in the blanks. But also, that\u2019s our situation as human beings. We\u2019re just dots, microbes living on this little rock. We have a tendency to think we\u2019re the center of the universe, but we\u2019re truly not. So the whole Lovecraftian notion that if we truly understood what was out there, we would go insane, I think that\u2019s actually correct!\n\nStephen King specializes in making mundane things terrifying, but that\u2019s harder to do in a visual medium. How did you approach making grass frightening and coming up with ways to escalate that fear?\n\nTo be honest, what you see of the field on-screen is what it\u2019s like. If you were to walk in that field, it\u2019s an unnerving experience, a little like swimming in the ocean. On a very primal level, you feel vulnerable. You can\u2019t see two feet in front of you. If there was a predator in there, you wouldn\u2019t know until it was too late. And the grass itself, I actually wish I\u2019d made more of this in the movie. It\u2019s serrated. It will cut you. It\u2019s not a friendly organism to humans. There\u2019s a little of that in the movie, but you hardly notice it. I wish there was more of it.\n\nBut I think really what it boils down to is presenting the grass as a character. It has agency and consciousness. And we anthropomorphize it, as opposed to it just being some inert, unaware thing. So you\u2019re like Jonah in the whale, in a way. You\u2019re stepping into an environment that\u2019s also a living thing.\n\nHow did you work with the actors, especially about suspending their disbelief around scary grass?\n\nAs somebody who\u2019s worked in this space before, I can tell you, it\u2019s really important that the actors express their fear. Some actors are afraid to do that. Some really good actors, for whatever reason, do not have it within themselves to show fear. And if you don\u2019t do that, the audience won\u2019t be afraid, either. It just doesn\u2019t work. So I made a point when we were casting the movie that the actors needed to do that, and they were also going to go through an emotionally and physically strenuous production, so they should be prepared.\n\nWhich they were! Laysla [De Oliveira], in particular, because of what her character has to go through, really gave a raw, unfiltered performance, and it has a huge impact on the film. She just let it all hang out. That\u2019s not an easy thing to do, and I don\u2019t think many people are necessarily capable of it. I would coach them, but there was a lot for them to work with. They were never standing in front of a green screen in a studio. They were always in an environment they could react to. I mean, Laysla got hypothermia while we were shooting, from the rain. It was physically taxing! But as painful as it was for her and the other actors, they were committed enough to use that pain to enhance their performances and make them feel real.\n\nThe overhead shots of the field, especially that opening shot, are one of the most impressive things in the film. Are those drone shots? Are they CGI enhanced?\n\nI don\u2019t want to say too much about how we made the film because I don\u2019t want to take away from the experience of it. But I will say this that opening shot, the high angle over grass, was shot from a drone and augmented because the grass wasn\u2019t that perfect. The grass naturally grows with paths and little clearings. You see a lot of that in the movie, but in that shot, we filled them all in, so it\u2019s just this wall of green. But it\u2019s all real grass. We didn\u2019t have to do that much work on it.\n\nWith things like CGI and drones getting so much cheaper, is technology radically changing how you personally address low-budget horror?\n\nYes, absolutely. But there\u2019s a push and pull with it. As great as CGI is \u2014 and it really, truly is \u2014 there\u2019s a backlash because it has to be done the right way. If it\u2019s not, it has a very cartoony, unreal quality. Horror really relies on things feeling like they\u2019re real and physical if they\u2019re going to be frightening. I\u2019ll give you a perfect example: unanimously, I believe people think John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing is much more frightening than the 2011 prequel, which incorporated a lot of CGI. Even outside the story and issues like that, people just found the creature more frightening in 1982 when it was a physical object photographed on film. There\u2019s a desire in the horror community, an appreciation of real physical makeup effects and physical props. Having said that, I think CGI is amazing, and I did incorporate it in this film. But I tried to do it in a way where you would never know that it\u2019s there.\n\nThere\u2019s one tremendous shot in Tall Grass with a reflection in a moving dewdrop, with the camera inverting. Was there a practical element to that shot?\n\nI don\u2019t want to say! [Laughs] I am sorry. Let me put it this way: you could never do that shot without CGI!\n\nThis film got me thinking about the difference between relatable horror where viewers feel like they could be in the protagonists\u2019 position, like what they\u2019re seeing could happen to them. And then there\u2019s uncanny horror, which is much less real. Do you see a division there? Do you see one as more interesting than the other?\n\nLet me put it this way: as an audience member and somebody who\u2019s grown up enjoying horror films, I like it when the genre\u2019s mutated, when it\u2019s pushed somewhere new. And I\u2019m as interested in re-creations of things that I\u2019ve seen before. For me, David Cronenberg is a very important figure because what he did was so personal, so groundbreaking, and so impossible to imitate. Or Guillermo del Toro, with his particular kind of Latin magic realism. That\u2019s what I aspire to, regardless of what kind of horror it is.\n\nAnybody could look at your body of work and see that impulse to break new ground, but you\u2019ve done a lot of interviews about how difficult it is to find backers for your films because people don\u2019t want to take risks on films that don\u2019t fit into familiar categories. Is the streaming age, and the splintering of movie audiences, helping you? Is it getting easier?\n\nYes! Oh, it really has. This film would not exist if Netflix hadn\u2019t chosen to make it. Or if it did, it wouldn\u2019t be as well-made. Because Netflix has both the willingness to let me make my own movie without interference and the resources to let me do things like that shot of the dewdrop. If I had made the film as a little independent movie, I couldn\u2019t have afforded to make this version. Making a horror film independently, there\u2019s a literal threshold for the financing. You\u2019re never going to get more than $5 million to make a movie. It\u2019s impossible, unless you have really big actors with tremendous international value.\n\nSo yes, this new landscape is exciting for somebody like me. I don\u2019t want to make big, big movies, but I don\u2019t really want to make micro-budget films, either. I\u2019ve always existed in the space between. That space disappeared after DVD disappeared, and the international marketplace wouldn\u2019t support it. And then studios started focusing on tentpole franchise movies. So that void is being filled by Netflix and Amazon and some of the other companies coming up. It\u2019s incredible. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a moment like this in the history of filmmaking, and because there\u2019s so much money being infused into it.\n\nAnd a lot of that money isn\u2019t being spent with a particular concern about instant return. It\u2019s more about staking a claim, wanting to make content that really draws people\u2019s attention, that is special. In the studio world, it\u2019s all about the bottom line. So much money is at risk, and people\u2019s jobs are at risk, so they just can\u2019t afford to take chances. So this is a transformative moment. Over the last five years, I\u2019ve done quite a bit of TV, and a lot of it was really interesting stuff that I was lucky to work on. But the line between TV and movies is blurring. It\u2019s all narrative content, which is great.\n\nThe other aspect is our movie will become available to 190 countries at the exact same moment, which is wonderful for the movie because it means more people will watch it, I hope. But also, we\u2019re in a historical moment where the world really needs to unite, to figure out some of the pressing issues we have. I don\u2019t want to sound utopian about this, but I do believe it\u2019s helpful that there\u2019s no classification to who gets to see this first. It\u2019s not going to open in America first, then filter through the rest of the world like they were second-class citizens.\n\nFilms are being democratized. So everyone gets the same content at the same time and shares the same experience at the same moment, which I have to believe is going to be unifying. If somebody makes something that influences how we perceive climate change, maybe that\u2019ll have a real impact. And it does seem like Netflix is working on that. I certainly don\u2019t think my film\u2019s going to do that. [Laughs] It\u2019s such a scary moment in the world right now, but there are a lot of things to be hopeful about and excited about.", "description": "The famed cult director of Cube, Splice, and Haunter discusses making his first Netflix movie, an adaptation of a horror novella written by Stephen King and Joe Hill.
