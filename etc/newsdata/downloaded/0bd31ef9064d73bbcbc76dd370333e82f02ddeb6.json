I warned he\u2019d seriously hurt my child and now there is a conviction to prove I was right all along.\n\n(Image: Roland Leon Sunday Mirror)\n\n\"My solicitor has told me we could have a case against social services because they didn\u2019t listen to a word I said.\u201d\n\nThe father was jailed for manslaughter in 2015 for killing another man and released early. But by violating the terms of his release he will now serve the rest of his eight-year term.\n\nHe has also been placed under indefinite restraining orders barring him from contacting his ex and their child.\n\nSocial workers advised a family court judge that although the man had a long history of violent offences he did not pose a risk to the girl.\n\nShe was allowed to stay with him while a report on her future was prepared.\n\nThis is because of a legal blind spot which means serious criminals are not automatically banned from time with their kids. Human rights laws also mean parents have a right to a family life.\n\nThe Sunday Mirror is fighting to change the law as part of our Save Kids From Violent Parents campaign, in which we revealed 63 children have died since 2004 during unsupervised contact with known abusive parents.\n\nWe told last month how the teen fled to her dad\u2019s house after a row with her mum over homework. And the mum said she ended up in a refuge after her ex raped and beat her.\n\nSave Kids From Violent Parents WHAT WE ARE CALLING FOR 1. A change in the law, which means anyone who has been convicted of violent crime, child abuse or sexual offences can\u2019t have automatic, unsupervised access to their kids. The same rules would apply to those who\u2019d had similar findings made against them in the civil courts. The ban could only be overturned by a judge if the parent had undergone a thorough assessment by an independent expert proving they have been rehabilitated. 2. Mandatory, standardised training in domestic abuse for judges, social workers and any other professionals involved in child access arrangements. We also want to see domestic abuse training for coroners overseeing domestic homicide inquests. 3. More State funding to support the hundreds of thousands of children in the UK affected by domestic abuse \u2013 including the 3,627 kids currently being supported by Refuge. It is only with the right support, such as specialist therapy, that these children can recover from the trauma they have experienced.\n\nWe now want to ensure no one convicted of violent crime, sexual offences or child abuse is given unsupervised access.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Sunday Mirror's Save Kids From Violent Parents campaign highlights a dad jailed for 10 weeks for assault - and a mum furious it was allowed to happen in the first place", "authors": ["Geraldine Mckelvie", "Image", "Getty", "Roland Leon Sunday Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466437.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Silhouette-of-little-girl-lying-in-bed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
