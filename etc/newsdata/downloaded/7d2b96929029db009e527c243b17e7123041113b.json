(Morry Gash/AP)\n\nA prisoner in Wisconsin has allegedly confessed to committing the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach, whose death was the focus of the Netflix docuseries, \u201cMaking a Murderer.\u201d\n\nTwo men, Steven Avery, 57 and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, 29, were convicted in 2007 in connection to Halbach\u2019s death and have maintained their innocence.\n\nThe man, who has not been publicly identified, made his as-yet uncorroborated confession to filmmaker Shawn Rech during a prison phone call on Sept. 21. Newsweek first reported the alleged confession, which Rech disclosed during an interview with the magazine about his forthcoming project, \u201cConvicting A Murderer,\u201d a follow-up docuseries unaffiliated with \u201cMaking a Murderer.\u201d\n\n[Netflix\u2019s documentary series \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 is gripping]\n\nThe Manitowoc County district attorney\u2019s office in Wisconsin did not immediately respond to The Washington Post\u2019s inquiries confirming that it was aware of the alleged confession. Rech, meanwhile, told The Post in an interview that he had passed an audio recording of the confession on to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cSteven Avery\u2019s attorney [Kathleen Zellner] has posted a few snarky tweets, and doesn\u2019t seem to believe much in [the confession],\u201d Rech said. \u201cBut what were we supposed to do? If true, it would exonerate their client.\u201d\n\nWe received the handwritten confession on Saturday. It is worthless unless it is corroborated.#MakingAMurderer2 #WorkingOnIt #NotsoFast \u2014 Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) September 24, 2019\n\nZellner did not respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment. Laura Nirider, who represents Dassey, declined to comment.\n\n\u201cThis person approached us 18 months ago and wrote a letter saying Steven Avery confessed to him. This person was trying to further the narrative that Steven Avery was guilty,\u201d Rech told The Post. A year and a half later as the production was entering the fact-checking and legal review phase, Rech wanted to revisit the man\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cWe found some problems with his story,\u201d Rech said, \u201cso I scheduled a prison call to confront him \u2014 Saturday morning.\u201d\n\nWhat the man revealed left Rech \u201cstunned.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe immediately called his letter [from 18 months ago] a fake and said that he in fact killed Teresa Halbach in what he characterized as a tragic accident,\u201d Rech said. The man allegedly decided to frame the homeowner at the scene, whom he didn\u2019t know was Steven Avery.\n\n\u201cIt was the last thing I expected,\u201d Rech added. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything we were looking for. I was speechless.\u201d\n\n[\u2019Making a Murderer\u2019 is back for Season 2. Here\u2019s what you need to know.]\n\nDespite the revelation, Rech said he doesn\u2019t find the man to be particularly credible; much of what the man told him during their 9\u00bd-minute call matched the \u201cvery public\u201d timeline of events that occurred during Halbach\u2019s Oct. 31 disappearance.\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the way I look at it: He promoted something for 18 months that he now says was a lie, but he\u2019s demonstrated he was capable of lying. He\u2019s a felon, so he\u2019s demonstrated he doesn\u2019t live within society\u2019s guardrails,\u201d Rech said. \u201cBut, he has killed someone in the state of Wisconsin before \u2014 and he was free at the time of Teresa Halbach\u2019s murder. So it at least has to be looked at.\u201d\n\nWhile Rech concedes the man feels guilty and could perhaps be telling the truth, he thinks the likelier motivation is the man\u2019s desire to collect a $100,000 reward that a private Wisconsin citizen posted earlier this month for tips that could lead to the \u201carrest and conviction of the real killer of Teresa Halbach.\"\n\nInvestigators must now corroborate the claim, which adds a new layer to an already complex legal saga that has taken several turns even before it became part of the national consciousness via Netflix.\n\nAvery\u2019s first criminal conviction was in 1985 when he was accused of sexually assaulting a local woman \u2014 a conviction from which he was later exonerated after spending 18 years in prison. Upon his release, Avery filed a $36 million wrongful conviction lawsuit against the county.\n\nJust two years later, Avery was charged with murdering Halbach.\n\n[Victims, Families and America\u2019s Thirst for True-Crime Stories]\n\nOn the day she disappeared, Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer, had an appointment at Avery\u2019s Manitowoc County home to photograph a minivan his sister was trying to sell. Prosecutors alleged Avery used a fake name to lure Halbach to his home, where he and Dassey, his nephew, sexually assaulted her and killed her before burning her body.\n\nAfter her car was recovered, investigators matched bloodstains in Halbach\u2019s vehicle to Avery\u2019s DNA and Halbach\u2019s charred remains were found on Avery\u2019s property, where his family had an auto salvage yard. Dassey later confessed to investigators, a confession Dassey\u2019s defense later said was unlawfully coerced from a learning-disabled teenager who had no lawyer present.\n\nAvery\u2019s defense has claimed local law enforcement framed him in retaliation for filing his wrongful conviction suit.\n\nDassey, charged as an accessory in Halbach\u2019s death, had his conviction tossed in 2016 before it was later reinstated on appeal. In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his case and both he and Avery remain in prison.\n\nRead more:\n\nAn acclaimed French chef is suing over a lost Michelin star.
