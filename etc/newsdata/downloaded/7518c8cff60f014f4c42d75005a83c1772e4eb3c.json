(PCG) is likely to sink still lower in the days, weeks and months ahead. The stock price has plunged in the past two years and we have to look back to 2001-02 to see when prices were this low. This kind of decline tells you there are serious fundamental problems.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of PCG, below, we can see that downside price gaps are fairly common. Investors and traders have been running to the exists. Prices had a recovery rally from January to June but they have quickly given back those gains.\n\nPCG is trading below the declining 50-day moving average line and the bearish 200-day line. In June and July the rally stopped at the underside of the bearish 200-day line reminding us that traders do pay attention to technical indicators.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line only improved into May and has been weak since then telling us that sellers of PCG have been more aggressive.\n\nThe 12-day price momentum study shows a lessening of downside momentum from August to October despite prices making lower price lows. This is a small bullish divergence and it will probably not spark a rally or a reversal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of PCG, below, we can see that prices have been weak since the middle of 2017. This massive decline in price tells me that this company has serious problems that not going to get fixed anytime soon. (The fundamental story is not hard to understand but I leave that to others.)\n\nPrices are below the declining 40-week moving average line and the OBV line is bearish. The 12-week price momentum study shows a bullish divergence but like the daily chart I do not think this is going to spark a rally.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of PCG, below, we can see that the software is projecting a downside price target of $3.81. Ouch.\n\nBottom line strategy: The morale of these charts (above) is do not fight a trend - up or down.", "description": "Let's check out the charts for some guidance....PCG", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "The Price Of Pg E Is Headed Still Lower In The Weeks Ahead", "Let'S Check Out The Charts For Some Guidance.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Doug Kass", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Jim Cramer", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/42cdf62c-d62c-11e9-822b-19d5344ad409.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
