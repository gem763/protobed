No one knew except me, and I wasn\u2019t sure what I knew, except that I felt terrified and physically ill. I wasn\u2019t about to describe what made me feel that way, either. So I hung out in the washroom, the one place he couldn\u2019t find me.\u201d\n\nDenhollander wrote that one day her abuser simply never returned to church. It wasn\u2019t until she was 12 years old, when she confided in her mother about the abuse, that she learned what had really happened.\n\nHer abuser had been asked to leave the church after several female college students made complaints about his inappropriate behavior. Other adults, including Denhollander\u2019s parents, had complained about the man\u2019s behavior toward Denhollander and another young girl at the church \u2015 not realizing he had already abused 7-year-old Denhollander.\n\nAlthough her parents prevented further abuse, Denhollander reflected on how they were ostracized from the community for accusing the young man of sexual abuse. This experience, she wrote, informed how she later handled Nassar\u2019s abuse.\n\n\u201cIt also left me with a lesson I\u2019ve never forgotten and had in fact taken into the exam room with Larry: If you can\u2019t prove it, don\u2019t speak up. Because it will cost you everything,\u201d Denhollander wrote.\n\nDenhollander publicly accused Nassar of sexual abuse in September 2016, telling the Indianapolis Star that he molested her during an appointment in 2000 when she was 15 years old.\n\nNassar, the former sports medicine doctor at Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, was a renowned trainer at the time. Denhollander endured an onslaught of victim blaming and character assassinations when she first came forward.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until a few months after she came forward that other athletes read her story and realized they had also been abused. Nassar, suspected of abusing nearly 500 athletes under the guise of medical treatment, is currently serving a life sentence on child pornography and child sex abuse charges.\n\nHead over to The Washington Post to read Denhollander\u2019s full essay.", "description": "Rachael Denhollander recently revealed that the first time she was sexually abused was at the age of 7 by a college student at her church.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d765df5240000822677c85a.jpeg?cache=avtatfnlvf&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
