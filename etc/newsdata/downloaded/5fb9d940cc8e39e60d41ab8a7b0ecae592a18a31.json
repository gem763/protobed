The newer, eco-friendly versions are made from sustainably sourced wood fibres and are fully recyclable. The concept of a paper-based bottle may sound strange at first, as you wonder how the structure would stand firm, holding liquid safely inside. According to Carlsberg, there is an inner barrier within the bottle that allows it to contain beer so it doesn\u2019t leak.\n\nWhat we know so far is that the first of the prototypes is made from a thin recycled PET plastic polymer film, while the second uses an 100% bio-based PEF plastic polymer film. Carlsberg states that it will be testing out both with the barrier technology.\n\nCarlsberg\n\nThe popular beer brand has been working on reducing its environmental impact for a while, having started work on the prototypes back in 2015. Although the paper bottles are yet to be available on the market, the prototypes illustrate the future of what recyclable packaging looks like in the drinking industry.\n\nCarlsberg claims these are the 'world first' sustainable drink packaging designs and has already made significant steps towards improving its sustainable strategy as a company. Last year, the brewing business cut down the amount of plastic substantially by gluing cans together, to avoid consumers buying multipacks in plastic ringed packaging. Glued together, the groups of beer bottles are called \u2018Snap Packs\u2019 and will reduce Carlsberg\u2019s plastic use by up to 76%. Of course, the glue is fully recyclable too.\n\n\u201cWe continue to innovate across all our packaging formats, and we are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on the Green Fibre Bottle so far\u201d, Myriam Shingleton, Vice President Group Development at Carlsberg Group, said in a public statement. Myriam claims that the ultimate ambition is to eventually bring this \u201cbreakthrough to market\u201d and to continue to overcome \u201cremaining technical challenges\u201d in plastic consumption.\n\nThe beer brand hopes to achieve zero carbon emissions at Carlsberg breweries by 2030.", "description": "Beer brand Carlsberg has just announced its most sustainable bottle design yet.", "authors": ["Maeve Campbell"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/75/72/1000x563_cmsv2_c3fac26d-c9b7-5260-ba5e-d1422a95e272-4237572.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
