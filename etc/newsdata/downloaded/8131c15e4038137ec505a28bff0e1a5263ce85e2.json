You\u2019re about to get out of your car and walk the fifteen feet of sidewalk separating you from the glass doors of the Family Planning Specialists Medical Group near Jack London Square in West Oakland. Statistically speaking, you\u2019re in the majority if you are black or Latina, low-income, in your twenties, unmarried, affiliated with a religion, and already the mother of least one child.\n\nInside the clinic is Jackie Barbic, executive director of the only abortion facility in the West Oakland/downtown area. Barbic opened the clinic with two physicians in 1984. At one point during the clinic\u2019s first five years, she said, a protestor named James Kopp broke in, chained himself to a table in an exam room adjacent to the operating room where a doctor was seeing a patient, and screamed Hail Marys until the police took him away. About a decade later, Kopp would go on to shoot and kill Dr. Barnett Slepian, an abortion provider in Amherst, New York. Kopp is now serving a life sentence in upstate New York, but to this day, Barbic says, she still watches protesters outside with some concern. As recently as May, another abortion doctor, George Tiller, was shot in a Kansas church. Tiller\u2019s clinic had been a target for abortion opponents for years beforehand.\n\nFrom the car window you see a man, middle-aged, African-American, standing ten feet away. He\u2019s in a black hooded sweatshirt. His ball cap sports the phrase, \u201cGot Jesus?\u201d He\u2019s holding a stack of papers that look like flyers or pamphlets.\n\nThis is Walter Hoye, a Union City-based preacher in the southern Baptist tradition who says he\u2019s convinced that abortion is tantamount to genocide in the African-American community, and that having an abortion for any reason is \u201ckilling a human life.\u201d Every woman who has an abortion, Hoye frequently says, \u201cknows what she\u2019s doing, deep down,\u201d and regrets it.\n\nNow Hoye is smiling at you, his dark eyes peering above his wire-rimmed shades. You open the door of your car.\n\nWhat happens next has been the subject of contentious legal debate since December 2007. That\u2019s when Oakland\u2019s City Council passed a law called the Bubble Ordinance to protect \u201caccess to reproductive health care facilities,\u201d according to the City Council\u2019s resolution. The ordinance prohibits protesters from approaching within eight feet of women within a 100-foot range of reproductive health clinics if they are \u201cobstructing access\u201d and do not have consent. It prohibits \u201cthe use of force, threat of force, or physical obstruction to intentionally injure, harass, or interfere with any person providing or obtaining constitutionally-protected reproductive health care services.\u201d Barbic says it took 15 years to persuade council members adopt the law, which was written by Councilmember Nancy Nadel and modeled after a similar 1993 ordinance adopted in Colorado. Since Colorado\u2019s ordinance passed, similar legislation creating \u201cbubbles\u201d or \u201cbuffer zones\u201d around health care facilities and abortion clinics have been debated, passed, and contested in towns and cities throughout the US.\n\nNew York and Florida have passed state laws in 1994 and 1997, respectively, to keep protesters away from clinic entrances and exits. Massachusetts\u2019s legislators passed a state law in November 2007 that created a 35-foot buffer zone around clinics. Last month the Chicago City Council passed a bubble ordinance that bans passing out materials, displaying signs, protesting, or counseling without consent within 50 feet of medical clinics and hospitals. Pro-life lawyers have told the press they plan to sue if the mayor does not veto the ordinance before it takes effect November 17. Last week, the 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals struck down Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\u2019s 2005 ordinance that kept clinic protesters 15 feet away from entrances as well as eight feet away from patients within a 100-foot radius of the clinic. The court ruled that either zone by itself would have been constitutional, but that when applied together, the ordinance violated protesters\u2019 free speech rights.\n\nBubble ordinances and similar laws, Barbic says, are \u201cabsolutely needed to offer patients privacy and protection.\u201d She says that before Oakland\u2019s ordinance was adopted, she regularly saw women crying and shocked by clinic protesters\u2019 overtures, which included trying to get into patients\u2019 cars, or in certain cases into the clinic itself. \u201cThey would ask, \u2018Why are they allowed to do this? Is this legal?\u2019 They felt very much that this was a violation,\u201d Barbic said.\n\nThree years ago, Catholic pro-life activists invited Hoye and his church, the Progressive Baptist Church in Berkeley, to join their weekly protests at the clinic. In particular, Hoye says, the sisters reached out to him because he is black, as are many of the clinic\u2019s patients. Hoye agreed, and since then has made a routine of standing outside the Family Planning Specialists Medical Group on Tuesday mornings, doing what he terms \u201csidewalk counseling.\u201d\n\nNow, after losing the battle to overturn Oakland\u2019s ordinance in the state courts, Hoye\u2019s attorneys are trying to convince a federal appellate court that the law unconstitutionally violates Hoye\u2019s right to free speech. One of his attorneys, Catherine Short, argues that the law discriminates against pro-life protesters. She says she\u2019ll appeal to the US Supreme Court if she has to. Like many of her abortion-opponent colleagues around the country, Short argues that the whole concept of a clinic \u201cbubble zone\u201d is unfair. \u201cIf you want to encourage women to enter the clinic, that\u2019s fine \u2013 if you want to ask them to consider the alternative \u2013 that\u2019s not okay?\u201d she says. \u201cWe believe that it is so clear that this is wrong.\u201d\n\nOn a hot fall afternoon at the College of Alameda, following a late morning outreach session to students, Hoye sat at a picnic table dressed in his characteristic all-black and \u201cGot Jesus?\u201d gear. A half-dozen older men and women, all white, had just packed up several two-foot by five-foot color photographic signs of bloody fetuses and driven away in a nondescript white van. Looking relaxed but alert, his forearms resting on the uncomfortable metal table, Hoye described a typical day outside the clinic in Oakland.\n\n\u201cThe first thing they can see is my sign \u2013 it simply says \u2018God loves you and your baby. Let us help you.\u2019\u201d Hoye said, his dark eyes peering levelly over his sunglasses. \u201cSo the first thing I say when I finally get a chance to talk to her is \u2018Good morning. May I talk to you about alternatives to the clinic?\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued. \u201cSometimes they want to talk, sometimes they don\u2019t. But you know what? Seeing an African-American preacher on the sidewalk\u2026you can imagine. Some people do want to talk. Some women are really struggling with that decision as they walk up. And they have said, \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t really understand that there are groups that could help me, or other options that are available.\u2019\u201d\n\nHoye says that on a good day, \u201cabout a fourth\u201d of the clinic patients will stop to listen to him for a while before going on in. He says that he\u2019s only seen a handful of women actually turn around and change their minds on the spot, but it\u2019s more common for \u201ca few\u201d patients to go in for \u201ctoo short of a time\u201d and then give him what he describes as a \u201cthank you wink\u201d on their way out. He assumes that those women had decided to forego abortion.\n\n\u201cThose are our saves,\u201d he said, looking pleased.\n\nHoye, a Detroit native who says he grew up influenced by religion and Dr Martin Luther King, Jr., expected to play football professionally until he \u201cgot called to preach\u201d in his twenties. He said he began to feel strongly about abortion in 1984, when his son was born nearly three months premature. At one point, Hoye said, his son\u2019s weight dropped from two pounds to one. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you saw those pictures over there,\u201d he said, gesturing to where the white van had been parked. \u201cThere\u2019s an aborted fetus about the size of my son.\u201d\n\nHe paused. \u201cSo I\u2019m holding my son in the palm of my hand.\u201d He was cradling his cellphone. \u201cThe iPhone I\u2019m holding is heavier \u2013 it\u2019s more than one pound. At that point, while I\u2019m holding him, I could see his hands and his eyes, his feet\u2026 It became very clear to me that this was a human being. He wasn\u2019t just a blot of tissue. It was no longer an academic exercise anymore for me; I was holding what was supposed to be on the inside of a woman. And at that point I knew what abortion was.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Abortion Federation, first-trimester abortions \u2013 which are performed within the first 13 weeks, or roughly three months, of pregnancy, account for 88 percent of all abortions nationwide. Also according to their website, \u201cfewer than two percent of abortions are provided at twenty-one weeks or after, and they are extremely rare after twenty-six weeks of pregnancy.\u201d\n\nHoye says that a primary cause of preterm miscarriages is abortion \u2013 a contention refuted by \u201cmost doctors,\u201d the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says on its website. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not consider abortion a cause of either miscarriage or breast cancer, another assertion advanced by some right-to-life groups. Hoye also says he believes abortion is a scheme orchestrated by eugenicists and Nazis to enact genocide on the African-American community. \u201cLook at the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a eugenicist.\u201d\n\nAsked for a response in a later interview, Barbic was speechless for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can say to that,\u201d she finally said, then took a breath. \u201cWomen of color have higher unplanned pregnancy rates. I\u2019d like to see a focus on working toward helping lower the unplanned pregnancy rate and making contraceptives more available. I think we have to look at bigger picture. I think he\u2019s twisted things around.\u201d\n\nThese days, Hoye still goes out to Family Planning Specialists Medical Group on some Tuesday mornings. But it\u2019s more complicated now, he says. He has to bring a team with him, including someone who can operate a video camera \u2013 for legal reasons, he said. He also has to stand at least eight feet away from the people entering or leaving the clinic \u2013 \u201can awkward distance to have a conversation,\u201d he complained. Hoye\u2019s relationship to the clinic\u2019s volunteer escorts \u2013 which until his trial was \u201ccivil,\u201d he says, characterized by small talk and even remembered birthdays \u2013 has deteriorated. The escorts carry blank pieces of cardboard to obscure his sign\u2019s message, and they scuttle the patients quickly past Hoye, taking advantage of the ordinance\u2019s restrictions on how closely he may approach.\n\nHoye\u2019s lawyer, Short, characterizes Hoye\u2019s manner as \u201cextremely gentle\u201d and says he has been unfairly targeted by the law. \u201cThis is pretty much a Pastor Hoye ordinance \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much just him and the little old ladies he comes with,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are determined to prevent women from talking to him. Their ideology is such that it is de facto harassment for anyone to be standing outside the clinic with a sign that says \u201cCan I help you?\u201d What is so bad about someone saying \u2018Can I talk to you about alternatives to abortion?\u2019\u201d\n\nBarbic tells a different story. She contends that Hoye is \u201cone of the more aggressive protesters\u201d who pickets the clinic \u2013 but that he\u2019s just one of many the clinic has seen over the years. Groups and individual protesters come and go, Barbic says, but the protests continue. \u201cThe right of patients to access medical care is more important that Mr. Hoye,\u201d she said. Currently, she says, every fourth Saturday of the month a group of Catholics pray in the parking lot opposite the clinic, carrying signs, singing and chanting. \u201cSome in their group get a little aggressive. One woman stands in middle of street, trying to stop the cars and hand out literature,\u201d Barbic says.\n\nBarbic notes that while the \u201cclinic invasions\u201d more common in the 1980s have tapered off, some protesters have become more aggressive toward patients and medical staff entering or leaving clinics. \u201cWhat you worry about is what happened with Dr Tiller,\u201d she said, meaning George Tiller, the Kansas abortion provider who was shot to death in May. \u201cIt\u2019s frightening. Especially when you have doctors murdered. I think it\u2019s scary for them,\u201d she says, referring to the staff at her clinic.\n\n\u201cRight now because of the Bubble Ordinance, Walter Hoye is not as aggressive as he was,\u201d Barbic says. \u201cHe always came with four or five other people. He would go up \u2013 if a patient drove up \u2013 actually stick his head in the window. He would try to hand brochures to them inside the car. He would walk across the street, down the sidewalk, and follow then until they got the front door. He was very close to them physically; they felt very uncomfortable. It was very upsetting to the majority of patients.\u201d\n\nBarbic says the video camera Hoye brought \u201cfrightened and intimidated\u201d clients to the point where they would drive away and reschedule their appointments for a day when Hoye was not expected to be there. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any patients that they\u2019ve helped,\u201d she says.\n\nIn May 2008, five months after the ordinance passed, Hoye was arrested for violating the ordinance and given a 30-day jail sentence, which he served in March this year (he got out early after 18 days). Since then, Barbic says, Hoye\u2019s change in behavior has been apparent. She says that before he was arrested, Hoye didn\u2019t seem to respect the ordinance. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to make a difference to him initially, until he was arrested, went to trial and found guilty.\u201d Now, she said, he seems to follow the law.\n\nClinic escort coordinator Barbara Hoke agreed. \u201cA lot of the stuff Walter did before the ordinance he can\u2019t do anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can\u2019t surround patients, block them from coming out of their cars, force literature on them.\u201d But, she says, what\u2019s at stake is much larger than Hoye\u2019s activities. She said the pro-life movement (she terms them \u201cthe anti\u2019s\u201d) is trying to make Hoye into a \u201cposter child\u201d for their cause.\n\n\u201cThis is about all the anti\u2019s in the country,\u201d Hoke said \u201cThey try to impose their value system on other people. They necessarily violate a woman\u2019s privacy when she\u2019s entering her doctor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nTwelve years ago, Hoke said, she decided she would go to abortion clinics in Oakland and offer to walk with women from their cars to the clinics in order to help them pass safely by pro-life protesters. Shortly afterward, she began organizing others to help her, and she has been coordinating clinic escort shifts since. The escorts, clad in identifiable orange vests, go to every Oakland clinic that has demonstrators. \u201cOrdinarily we schedule two people to escort at a clinic,\u201d Hoke said. When protests are large and numerous\u2013like last year, Hoke recalled\u2013there might be twenty to thirty clinic escorts on-call. \u201cOur function is simply to make sure women have access and can go into that clinic in a safe way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe impunity of escorts under the Bubble Ordinance has incited the ire of Short, who argued that the law is clearly biased because it allows volunteer clinic escorts to approach patients and speak to them, while Hoye can\u2019t. Short also argued that by covering Hoye\u2019s signs, the escorts are inhibiting Hoye\u2019s right to free speech.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s not unconstitutional, I don\u2019t think we have any meaning for that anymore,\u201d Short said heatedly. \u201cEscorts are not employees, they get to wear orange vests, the city says they can go up to women and say whatever they like, including \u2018Don\u2019t listen to him, he\u2019s only here to harass you.\u2019 They say the women in the orange vests are \u2018facilitating access.\u2019 But obviously, they\u2019re counter-protesters.\u201d\n\nCity of Oakland attorney Vicki Laden, who has been defending the ordinance in court, refuted Short. \u201cEscorts approach patients not in order to counsel or engage them in conversation but rather to help them get into clinics,\u201d she wrote in legal briefs filed in May. \u201cEscorts do not engage in abortion-related speech or advocate a pro-choice viewpoint to patients. Escorts do not wear writing of any kind. They do not hoist slogans or political viewpoints. The only signs they use are blank. They do not chant or shout pro-choice messages,\u201d Laden wrote, citing Hoke. And, she added during an interview, escorts are also bound by the same rules that apply to Hoye \u2013 they also have to ask the women near clinics for permission to approach them.\n\nIn August, US District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer upheld Oakland\u2019s Bubble Ordinance as \u201ccontent neutral,\u201d and ruled that police have been appropriately applying the law. In October, he denied Hoye\u2019s application for a halt on enforcement of the law while Hoye\u2019s lawyers continue to appeal. \u201cThe public interest lies in balancing the right to free speech and expression with the right to access reproductive health care; granting an injunction would skew that balance,\u201d Breyer wrote.\n\nShort says she is still hopeful. She and Hoye\u2019s other attorney, Michael Millen, still plan on filing an appeal soon. \u201cWe believe that it is so clear that this is wrong \u2013 everybody agrees,\u201d she said confidently. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, her case\u2019s next stop, has not been particularly friendly to abortion protesters, she said. \u201cBut they take content neutrality very seriously,\u201d Short said. \u201cIf you want to encourage women to enter the clinic, that\u2019s fine \u2013 if you want to ask them to consider the alternative \u2013 that\u2019s not okay.\u201d\n\nBut Laden says she doesn\u2019t expect the appellate judges to rule differently than Breyer did. \u201cThe First Amendment does not guarantee Plaintiff the right to always communicate at a \u2018polite\u2019 distance,\u201d she wrote in the legal brief filed in May. Laden argued in the same brief that the ordinance \u201cwas passed not to stifle speech but to secure access to reproductive health care in the face of a long history of threatening and sometimes violent protests.\u201d She said that the ordinance \u201cdoesn\u2019t prohibit free speech \u2013 it only prohibits intimidation and harassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chance of the 9th Circuit overturning this ruling I\u2019d say is zero,\u201d Laden said later. \u201cAn ordinance virtually identical to this was upheld in Hill v. Colorado.\u201d In Hill v. Colorado, the Supreme Court upheld the Colorado law after which Oakland\u2019s ordinance was modeled.\n\nSo why would Hoye and his lawyers pursue what Laden calls a zero-percent chance of winning? Laden paused to consider. \u201cIf people are kind of ideologues, they can be oblivious to the law on their issue. Even though they\u2019re challenging a law virtually identical to a law the Supreme Court has upheld, that doesn\u2019t seem to have any effect on their thinking.\u201d\n\nOutside the Family Planning Specialists Medical Group, the protests continue, and patients walk past. \u201cThey\u2019re still here, they\u2019re still protesting,\u201d said Barbic. \u201cBut with the bubble ordinance in effect, they\u2019re not blocking patients. It\u2019s given the patients just a little bit of protection.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Puck Lo"], "top_image": "https://oaklandnorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/20091105_lo_clinic.jpg", "published_at": "2009-11-07"}
