It happened after someone pointed out the suspect mole to Ryan and he was \u201cfortunate to have a skin check at work,\u201d he added in a post.\n\nHis mole was classified as a nevus spilus, which is a common skin lesion that contains multiple pigmented spots within a broader pigmented patch, said Dr. Adam Friedman, professor and interim chair of dermatology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. He was not involved in Ryan Glossop\u2019s case.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

Is a spot growing or shrinking, lighter or darker, symmetric or asymmetric?\u201d\n\nSuch questions are part of the ABCDEs of melanoma, an acronym that considers not just one feature of a mole, but five: asymmetry, border, color, diameter and, \u201cmost importantly,\u201d evolution, Friedman said.\n\nThe back of the neck is a common spot for skin cancer because it\u2019s a sun-exposed area that many people forget to protect, along with ears, neck and hands, he added.\n\nAs doctors removed Ryan Glossop\u2019s affected skin, the margins kept coming back as abnormal, his wife wrote, or still containing cancerous cells. In May, a large area of skin from his neck and back was taken out and he had a skin graft using tissue from his legs to cover that huge section.\n\nDoctors need to remove enough normal skin around the tumor to ensure it is all out, Friedman noted.\n\nAfter Ryan Glossop\u2019s wife posted his ordeal, he wrote it was his opportunity to motivate others to get their skin checked.\n\n\u201cFortunately for me, the rest is in the past and I\u2019m moving forward,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe strength that Ryan has had through this whole process amazes me, not only has he managed his pain considerably well but he has kept it together,\u201d his wife added, urging others to spread his message. \u201cYour life is too precious to just bake yourself in the sun and not worry about your skin.\u201d\n\nThe case highlights the importance of diligent sun protection of exposed areas of the body every day, using SPF 30+ broad spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing, Friedman said.\n\nHe recommends annual skin checks with a board certified dermatologist, and self-checks every other month to look for new spots and moles, or monitor any that are changing. The sooner a diagnosis is made, the easier it is to treat and the greater the chance for survival, he noted.", "description": "What does melanoma look like?
