If you are not fully informed on the Hong Kong protests, to put it simply: Hong Kong citizens are speaking out for their right to democratic freedom, and against government control from mainland China. As the protests have continued, police violence has ensued.\n\nThere is obvious global and political baggage here.\n\nThe NBA does major business in China, where its game has become extremely popular over the last decade, giving the league and its partners a gateway to expand American pro basketball\u2019s global reach. In 2016, Disney-owned ESPN signed a major deal with Chinese tech giant Tencent to stream NBA coverage in China. Tencent has a $1.5 billion partnership with the NBA.\n\nNeedless to say, the NBA\u2019s business partners in China did not like Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet. (He deleted it, but the damage was done.) Coincidentally, the Chinese Basketball Association is led by Yao Ming, the former Houston Rockets star. If all of that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the timing was especially awkward: the Brooklyn Nets and L.A. Lakers are set to play an exhibition game in Shanghai this week, part of the league\u2019s public effort to grow the game in China.\n\nAfter the Morey tweet, the Chinese Basketball Association threatened to end its relationship with the Rockets; Tencent threatened to stop streaming Rockets games; Chinese sneaker brand Li Ning says it will end its relationship with the Rockets.\n\nChina Daily, the state-owned Chinese newspaper, was unequivocal in a public statement: \"Let's hope the incident with Morey and the Houston Rockets will teach other companies a lesson: the big Chinese market is open to the world, but those who challenge China's core interests and hurt Chinese people's feelings cannot make any profit from it.\u201d\n\nThe NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver have responded by trying to make good with China. By doing so, Silver has now angered many basketball fans at home in America.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver speaks during a news conference before Game 1 of basketball's 2016 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers in Oakland, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) More\n\nFirst Morey tweeted out an apology on Sunday night, saying, \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China... I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided... My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nWithin an hour, the NBA then issued its own apology, distancing itself even further from Morey, saying his tweet \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d The Chinese language version of the NBA\u2019s statement was different, and far more harshly worded about Morey\u2019s tweet, saying it \u201cseverely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.\u201d\n\nRockets owner Tilman Fertitta was even faster to distance the team from Morey, tweeting late on Friday night that Morey, \u201cdoes NOT speak for the Houston Rockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d\n\nBrooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai posted a long letter on Facebook condemning Morey\u2019s tweet, saying, \u201cI am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nHouston Rockets player James Harden jumped on board and apologized to China on Monday at a practice in Tokyo, Japan, saying, \u201cWe apologize. You know we love China. We love playing there.\u201d", "description": "The Houston Rockets general manager got into trouble over the weekend by tweeting about the Hong Kong protests.", "authors": ["Daniel Roberts", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/owFhPfsjDze0234gYkVGvg--~B/aD0yMjg2O3c9MzMxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b8dbb8b0-e900-11e9-bfff-5e2ce2aafe3e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
