As a result, Coopey, who had a string of previous convictions, faced a drug-driving charge, rather than death by dangerous or careless driving which carry jail terms of 14 years and five years respectively.\n\nYesterday, as the families of Mr Shackley, 61, from Milton Keynes, and Mr Imi, 48, from Twickenham, south-west London, called on police to reopen the case, it emerged that officers were reviewing statements Coopey gave at the inquest. It raises the prospect of Coopey, who was given 100 hours of community service at Reading Youth Court and banned from the road for two years over the fatal crash, potentially being re-arrested and charged again.\n\nVictim: John Shackley, 61, from Milton Keynes, was killed in August last year. His family are calling on police to reopen the case\n\nVictim: Jason Imi, 48, from Twickenham, south-west London, pictured with his wife Sarah\n\nCoopey (pictured), who admitted smoking cannabis before the crash, said: \u2018I first braked when they were on the pavement because they are looking out on the road as if they are going to cross'\n\nMr Shackley\u2019s daughter Danielle, 31, said: \u2018Coopey is basically sat there laughing at us. We cannot rest and we cannot grieve. We are not getting any justice and we are not being treated properly. How can you get behind the wheel of a car while you are high on drugs, kill two people and not go to prison?\u2019\n\nFamily lawyers say Coopey\u2019s account of the crash at Sunninghill, Berkshire, suggests he may have been speeding, which should have led to the CPS to consider charging him with causing death by dangerous driving. They believe the police investigation was \u2018flawed\u2019 and are \u2018baffled\u2019 why officers did not submit a file of evidence to the CPS. Coopey, now 18, lives in a \u00a31 million house in Ascot, with his parents, Russel, a sergeant in the Met, and Catherine Coopey, who until last year was a schools liaison officer in the same force.\n\nHe broke his silence over the fatal incident outside the Royal Berkshire Hotel at an inquest on July 8. Coopey, who admitted smoking cannabis before the crash, said: \u2018I first braked when they were on the pavement because they are looking out on the road as if they are going to cross.\u2019\n\nNicholas Hinchliffe QC, for the families, said a tyre mark on the road matching the tread of the Audi showed Coopey had applied the brakes only at the point of impact, despite having at least two seconds to react.\n\nThames Valley Police said: \u2018A review of the statements by Max Coopey ... is being undertaken.\u2019", "description": "The words of drug-driver Max Coopey, 18, are being reviewed by police after he gave his first account of the offence at the inquests over two deaths.
