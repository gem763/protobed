Its buzzy mainland Chinese version is called Douyin, whose translation means \u201cshaky sound.\u201d But the non-Chinese version TikTok, which boasts SoftBank and Sequoia Capital as backers, has become the go-to short-video app for users from the U.S. to Europe and Asia.\n\nThe app is similar to the now-defunct Vine, which featured short catchy videos that looped and allowed users to easily share them on social networks.\n\nBut the company remains under Chinese jurisdiction, and has been criticized for removing content deemed sensitive to Beijing.\n\nIn a free-speech forum Thursday at Georgetown University, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg took a jab at TikTok, seen by many as a competitor to the American company\u2019s video-sharing dominance.\n\nZuckerberg zeroed in on the pro-democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for months.\n\n\u201cWhile our services like WhatsApp are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the U.S. Is that the internet we want?\u201d he said.\n\nTikTok has denied that it is influenced by Chinese government pressure and refutes Zuckerberg\u2019s allegation that it removes or restricts content at the behest of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s comments come just weeks after U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio asked the American government to investigate TikTok\u2019s practices.\n\nAmong his complaints, Rubio alleges that TikTok has removed videos relating to the Hong Kong protests.\n\n\u201cAmple & growing evidence exists that TikTok\u2019s platform for western markets, including the U.S., are censoring content in line with #China\u2019s communist government directives,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nToday I will be asking CFIUS to review #TikTok\u2019s acquisition of https://t.co/0wGGsvV96T.\n\n\n\nAmple & growing evidence exists that TikTok\u2019s platform for western markets, including the U.S., are censoring content in line with #China\u2019s communist government directives. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 9, 2019\n\nThe Florida Republican later added that the \u201cChinese government\u2019s nefarious efforts to censor information inside free societies around the world cannot be accepted and pose serious long-term challenges to the U.S. and our allies.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s request came after the U.S. passed a broadened mandate for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, which examines foreign firms\u2019 acquisitions for national security risks.\n\nThough TikTok has said it doesn\u2019t censor its content, owner Bytedance has submitted to Beijing\u2019s demands more than once. Earlier this year, at government request, it suspended its popular news-aggregation site Jinri Toutiao, and closed jokes app Neihan Duanzi, that had become one of the company\u2019s biggest draws.\n\nDespite the censorship charges, Bytedance remains a formidable up-and-comer in China\u2019s tech scene. The TikTok parent boasts an estimated value of $75 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, and is working on an initial public offering expected this year or next, the newspaper reported back in June, citing people familiar.\n\nNot only has it eschewed investment from industry giants Tencent Holdings TCEHY, -0.95% and Alibaba Group BABA, -4.37%, it has sued the former for spreading false information about the company, a claim Tencent denies.\n\nTencent has had reason to be worried. In 2018, the Chinese government ceased approving new online games \u2014 the company\u2019s core revenue line. Though Beijing has resumed allowing new titles, the freeze hit Tencent at a time when Bytedance was rapidly gaining in popularity.\n\nChina\u2019s new-media landscape is notoriously cutthroat. Bytedance itself has faced several challengers, most recently from startup Kuaishou, which is backed by Tencent, and is rumored to be planning an IPO this year, Bloomberg News reported last month.\n\nBut its most difficult challenge may be in balancing its acceptance in freer Western markets while it continues to threaten powerful incumbents at home in China.", "description": "Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, which has exploded in popularity globally, has recently come under fire for censoring content that Beijing deems...", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT629_tiktok_ZG_20191018130414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
