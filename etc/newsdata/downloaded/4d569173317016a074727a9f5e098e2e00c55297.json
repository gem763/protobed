ABC news now learned that call was to the president of Ukraine. Overnight president trump's personal attorney coming to his defense in an explosive interview. Our chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas has the very latest. Reporter: This morning multiple sources telling ABC news that whistle-blower complaint involved a phone call between president trump and the president of Ukraine earlier this summer. While we don't yet know the details of the call, \"The Washington post\" reports the president made a promise to a foreign leader alarming one administration official who filed a complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community. The latest accusation will only fuel the concerns of house Democrats who were already investigating whether president trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, were pressuring Ukrainian officials to look into vice president Joe Biden's diplomatic efforts in that country when his son was doing business there during the Obama administration. Overnight Giuliani at first denied those allegations. Did you ask the Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden? No, actually I didn't. Reporter: Then seconds later admitting he did just that. You did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden. Of course, I did. You just said you didn't. Reporter: House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff is alleging a cover-up after the acting director of national intelligence and the justice department blocked the inspector general from sharing the whistle-blower's complaint with congress. In a letter to acting intelligence director Joseph Maguire, it was bluntly stated that they were trying to protect the president. Do you stand by the statement in your letter? It likely involves either the president or people around him. Reporter: But Giuliani showing utter contempt for Schiff and any congressional investigation. If Adam Schiff sent me a letter I would just tear it up and -- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, of course. Reporter: Schiff vowing to go court if he doesn't get answers. Another legal and political battle fully engaged. The president dismissing it as fake news denying any wrongdoing.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The Ukrainian readout of Trump and Zelensky\u2019s call noted they spoke about", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190920_gma_thomas3_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
