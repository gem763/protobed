For me, I feel like it\u2019s more personal than that now, because I have a close sort of relationship with the brand and the people who work there\u2026there\u2019s something very personal and familiar about the brand to me now.\u201d\n\nGlen Powell had nothing but high praise for the actress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a big fan of Margot Robbie and what she represents,\u201d said the actor, who next appears in \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d \u201cMargot represents someone who is forging her own path, and Chanel represents and supports women who are forging their own paths\u2026I find that in an era of dying stars, where the movie star doesn\u2019t exist, Margot proves that it can.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2026in Hollywood\u201d star channeled a \u201cfree woman,\u201d in the advertising campaign for the fragrance, an ode to the house\u2019s founder Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.\n\nGabrielle Chanel Essence, which retails starting at $105, is \u201cwarmer\u201d than previously released Chanel Gabrielle, shared the house\u2019s notable perfumer, Olivier Polge. A floral scent, it features jasmine, orange blossom, ylang-ylang and the tuberose flower, a new choice for Chanel and the most prominent ingredient. \u201cWhite flowers are scents that are quite strong. I think there\u2019s a higher intensity in Gabrielle Essence\u2026[Coco \u201cGabrielle\u201d Chanel] is the one who had this important idea that fragrances and fashion could be related.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe decided what she wanted to do and then created the path,\u201d said Robbie, who founded her own production company, LuckyChap Entertainment. \u201cI definitely wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m in the same realm as Coco Chanel, as Gabrielle Chanel, but I do feel more in charge of my destiny\u2026\u201d\n\nRobbie will next appear in a slew of films, including starring in Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d and Jay Roach\u2019s \u201cBombshell,\u201d centered on the downfall of Fox News\u2019 Roger Ailes; she\u2019ll also take on a familiar role, playing DC Comics\u2019 Harley Quinn once again in spin-off \u201cGotham City Sirens,\u201d as well as \u201cThe Suicide Squad\u201d sequel, directed by James Gunn.\n\n\u201cHe needs to shoot his DC [Comics] movies first,\u201d said French actress Pom Klementieff of working with Gunn in \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\u201d expected to be released in 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time, but the script is incredible. It\u2019s amazing, hilarious, heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nThe event brought out many young actors including Kristine Froseth, Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Maika Monroe, Carson Meyer, Alex Fitzalan, Julia Goldani Telles, Rainey Qualley and Lucy Fry. There were also artist Alex Prager; sisters Alana, Este and Danielle Haim of the band Haim; singer Cyn (signed to Katy Perry\u2019s label Unsub Records); \u201cStranger Things\u2019\u201d Joe Keery and Charlie Heaton, and \u201cEuphoria\u201d stars Maude Apatow and Will Peltz, who showed up in support of his girlfriend, Chanel model Kenya Kinski Jones.\n\n\u201cWe get ready together,\u201d said Peltz. The duo often attend industry events together. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit more of a diva than Kenya.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, definitely,\u201d added Jones, daughter of music mogul Quincy Jones.\n\nA memorable experience from shooting the controversial HBO series, Peltz said, was his sex scene with actress Barbie Ferreira.\n\n\u201cWe were doing it on these awkward apple boxes, and I was supposed to be pounding her, and my knees kept hitting these boxes,\u201d he shared. \u201cI had these crazy bruises on my legs, and we were supposed to look like we\u2019re really into it or whatever, and I\u2019m just hurting myself all over the place.\u201d", "description": "\"Good things happen when I wear Chanel,\u201d said the Australian actress at Chateau Marmont in L.A.", "authors": ["Rchikhoune", "Ryma Chikhoune"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c7SSbFHQOqj.nnJzPlL15Q--~B/aD0xMzY2O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/wwd_409/6553f794ec2d69fdb8b6bc301a5d53c1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
