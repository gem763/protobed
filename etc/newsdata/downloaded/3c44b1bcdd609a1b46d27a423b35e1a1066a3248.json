Penn State drove 35 yards on a gassed Iowa defense, and the last of three straight runs by Cain made it 17-6.\n\nIowa pulled within 17-12 when Stanley found Brandon Smith for a 33-yard TD pass with 2:31 to go. The Hawkeyes' two-point try failed though, and Cain converted a crucial third down that ensured that Iowa never saw the ball again.\n\nUp 7-6 late in the third quarter, Penn State recovered a fumble at Iowa's 16 and Sean Clifford connected on an apparent touchdown pass to Pat Freiermuth that was overturned on review. Iowa then held the Nittany Lions at the 1-foot line, and two straight holding calls forced them to settle for a 33-yard field goal.\n\nKJ Hamler caught seven passes, including a 22-yarder for a TD, for Penn State.\n\nStanley threw for 286 yards, but the Hawkeyes ran for just 70 yards on 30 attempts.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nPenn State: The Nittany Lions survived their toughest road challenge outside of a trip to Ohio State on Nov. 23. Penn State was on the road against a talented team with a jacked-up crowd, and yet the Nittany Lions were the ones making the plays that made the difference.\n\nIowa: The Hawkeyes nearly went back-to-back games without a touchdown. Granted, Michigan and Penn State are really good on defense. But Iowa can't continue to lean on its own defense to keep it in games. At 1-2 in the league and with Wisconsin looking like one of the best teams in America, the Big Ten West doesn't look so winnable anymore.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nPenn State might move up a few spots. Iowa might struggle to hang onto its spot in the Top 25 after back-to-back losses.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPenn State hosts Michigan on Oct. 19.\n\nIowa hosts Purdue next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
