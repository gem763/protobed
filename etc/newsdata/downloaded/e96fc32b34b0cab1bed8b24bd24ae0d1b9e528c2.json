(Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\n'Hostile environment'\n\nMayor Jim Watson raised the idea of a camera network in the ByWard Market after several violent incidents earlier this year, including three fatal shootings.\n\nCity staff are expected to issue a report later this year, in time for the budget planning process.\n\nFor McAleese, however, it's not just about the cost. She said the cameras will make the market a less hospitable place.\n\n\"Everyone who enters the area where the CCTV cameras might be would have to be concerned about their privacy,\" she said.\n\n\"If the cameras are installed in the ByWard Market, this would become a hostile environment for certain people.\"\n\nSince launching the group, McAleese said they've already heard from a number of citizens who are against the plan.\n\n\"We are getting some comments already about how people would rather see the money invested in community supports,\" she said.\n\nAnn Cavoukian, the former privacy commissioner of Ontario, says CCTV cameras are not widely used by Canadian municipalities, but they've been adopted in other jurisdictions. (Joe Fiorino/CBC)\n\nPrivacy question\n\nAnn Cavoukian, Ontario's former privacy commissioner and executive director of the Global Privacy and Security by Design Centre, said cities often find surveillance cameras attractive.\n\nThey haven't spread aggressively in Canada, but in other parts of the world \u2014 like the United Kingdom \u2014 they have become ubiquitous, she said.\n\nIn societies such as ours, we can take privacy and freedom for granted. - Ann Cavoukian\n\nWhat's more, they can be used for the wrong reasons, especially when combined with facial recognition technology, and can generate a lot of false positives, Cavoukian said.\n\nShe suggested that if the city goes ahead with a network, the video should be encrypted and available to police only if they get a court order.\n\n\"Privacy forms the foundation of our freedom. If you value free and democratic societies then you value privacy,\" Cavoukian said. \"But in societies such as ours, we can take privacy and freedom for granted.\"\n\nWatson's press secretary, Livia Belcea, said the mayor is waiting to hear from staff on the proposal.\n\n\"A memo exploring the feasibility of a pilot project of CCTV cameras in the ByWard Market will be brought forth to council later this fall,\" she said in an email.\n\n\"Mayor Watson looks forward to reviewing and considering the findings of the memo once it is available.\"", "description": "A new coalition of researchers and activists wants the City of Ottawa\u00a0to pull the plug on a proposal for surveillance cameras in the ByWard Market\u00a0before they start rolling.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5311937.1570466657!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/byward-market-george-william-weather-fall-autumn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
