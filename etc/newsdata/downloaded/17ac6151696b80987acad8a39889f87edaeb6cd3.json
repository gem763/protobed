He said he has occasionally met family members there \u2014 his last reported visit was in January \u2014 who seem in control before the cargo plane arrives.\n\n\u201cAnd then 20 minutes later we\u2019ll be outside when that big [cargo] plane pulls up and that door comes down, and they are walking the coffin with their boy inside, this coffin with an American flag over the top,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen [relatives] that I thought were really incredible the way they were taking it \u2014 I didn\u2019t even understand how they could take it so well \u2014 scream like I\u2019ve never seen anything before.\n\n\u201cSometimes they\u2019ll run to the coffin,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey\u2019ll break through military barriers, they\u2019ll run to the coffin and jump on top of the coffin \u2014 crying mothers and wives, crying desperately.\u201d\n\nHe said of their sorrow, \u201cAnd this is on these endless wars that just never stop. There\u2019s a time and there\u2019s a place, but it\u2019s time to stop.\u201d\n\nMany in Congress are criticizing Mr. Trump for withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria, a move they say gave the green light to Turkey on Wednesday to attack its ancient enemy, the Kurds. Kurdish fighters had been helping U.S. forces defeat the Islamic State in the region.\n\nMr. Trump said his \u201chardest\u201d jobs is writing letters to the parents of fallen soldiers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only that, [it\u2019s the casualties] in areas where there\u2019s not a lot of upside,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIn many cases there\u2019s only downside. And especially when that soldier was killed in a blue-on-green attack, where a [foreign] soldier being trained turned his gun on an American soldier. We have many of them in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe president said he campaigned on ending long-running U.S. wars, and he spoke of former President Dwight Eisenhower, who had warned Americans about the influence of the U.S. \u201cmilitary-industrial complex.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we go with the theory of some folks in Washington, who all do well with the military-industrial complex \u2026 Dwight Eisenhower had it figured right many years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got tremendous power. They like fighting. They make a lot of money when they fight. But it was time to bring our soldiers back home.\u201d\n\nThe president also spoke of his visits with wounded warriors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, such as a trip he made there last week. One soldier he met had facial reconstruction for horrific injuries.\n\nThe president awarded five Purple Hearts on that visit.\n\nHe said of those criticizing his military withdrawal in Syria, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to talk tough, you know, tough guys, all these tough guys \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s keep fighting, let\u2019s keep fighting.\u2019 For me it\u2019s very hard, when I see [wounded soldiers], it\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
