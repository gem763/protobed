House Democrats Won't Commit To That Thursday Impeachment Vote", "language": "en", "text": "Well, it\u2019s official. The impeachment push is about to get an official vote. The resolution is out. The rules are established. The GOP gets subpoena power, though they need to cite their reasoning and the Democrats can veto. This isn\u2019t unusual. Not much has changed concerning the rules. While House Republicans have the ability to torpedo the Democrats\u2019 impeachment narrative concerning his July phone call with the Ukrainian political leadership, where quid pro quo allegations have been lobbed, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) very much remains the dark lord of the Sith for this impeachment push. Polling on the subject in battleground states was not good for Democrats, which might explain this shift. Let\u2019s also not forget that for the most part, Schiff and his crew have conducted this impeachment crusade in secret. It\u2019s all in the bunker to control the narrative.\n\nJUST IN: House resolution empowers SCHIFF to call public hearings and add as many rounds of uninterrupted questioning as he wants -- up 45 minutes per side -- in which only SCHIFF/NUNES or a staffer can ask questions. https://t.co/A6EhTLapBO \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) October 29, 2019\n\nThere's not much else of significance in here. It directs the Judiciary Committee to issue its own procedures for offering Trump the ability to call or cross examine witnesses.https://t.co/A6EhTLapBO \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) October 29, 2019\n\nALSO: The resolution spells out that Republicans can suggest subpoenas or witnesses but must submit justifications in writing and they can be vetoed by Dems.\n\n\n\nThat's consistent with previous impeachment procedures. https://t.co/A6EhTLapBO \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) October 29, 2019\n\nThe 2020 election is a long way away, and the Democrats have yet to select a nominee. There\u2019s no way you can keep one of the most consequential political maneuvers\u2014impeachment\u2014in the dark like this. It looked unfair. It looked like a witch hunt. And Democrats were only going to animate the Trump base if they kept their little game of cloak and dagger going on this issue. So, Thursday is set to vote on this resolution\u2026or is it? House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said that nothing is set in stone. He hasn\u2019t read the impeachment inquiry rule and won\u2019t fully commit to a floor vote as of tonight. This could change by tomorrow morning, but our friends at Twitchy are suggesting that Hoyer might not have the votes.\n\n.@LeaderHoyer says he hasn't read impeachment inquiry rule, won't fully commit to a floor vote Thursday. \"We're going to have to consider whether or not it's ready to go on Thursday. I hope that's the case.\" \u2014 Cameron Joseph (@cam_joseph) October 29, 2019\n\nIf they had the votes, they would take the vote...\n\n\n\nWhat they instead is a transcript that proves this entire process is a secret coup. https://t.co/SojL7Np2wi \u2014 John Ocasio-Nolte (@NolteNC) October 29, 2019\n\nDemocrats have been plotting this freakshow since day one of the Trump presidency. They also promised their deranged base that something concerning impeachment would occur. They have to deliver, even if the charges are straight trash.\n\nThe whistleblower report about the Trump-Ukraine call alleges that Trump threatened President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a corruption probe into Hunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, who was sitting on the board of an energy company allegedly selling access for $50,000/month. Why else would someone who has zero experience in this field be there? The price for Ukraine for refusing this request is no aid. That was the allegation made by a reported CIA agent, who is also a registered Democrat, and one who had worked with a 2020 candidate. This person also worked at the Obama White House and contacted Schiff\u2019s staff prior to filing this report; Schiff knew of its contents beforehand. This person did not hear the phone call. It\u2019s all based on second-hand accounts, which explains the numerous errors. The whistleblower is a Democrat, a CIA agent, had worked with 2020 Democrats and had contacted one of the main quarterbacks in the Left\u2019s impeach Trump effort that got this impeachment bus on the road. So, yeah\u2014I don\u2019t believe anything that comes from the Democrats on this front. I know, call me crazy.", "description": ".10/29/2019 19:59:46PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/31/6095cd9b-50c1-4634-aa61-e30bc7778613.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
