REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nOsaka made her breakthrough in 2018 with her win over Serena Williams in the final of the U.S. Open, a victory that helped secure a place at her first tour championships final last year.\n\nBut three defeats saw the then 21-year-old exit the competition at the end of the group phase as Elina Svitolina went on to win the title in Singapore.\n\nThe Japanese right-hander, however, bounced back in style, winning the Australian Open in January before finishing the season ranked third in the world after claiming victories at the China Open and the Pan Pacific Open in Japan.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really good way to end the year and I hope that I play well compared to last year,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLast year the end of the year was just so hectic for me, and I didn\u2019t really remember anything. Honestly, by the time I got here, I was just so tired.\u201d\n\nOsaka added: \u201cI definitely think last year helped me in the way that I kind of know the format more. Before last year, I haven\u2019t played round-robin since I was, like, eight or 10.\u201d\n\nOsaka begins her challenge at the $14 million event against Petra Kvitova after being drawn against the Czech as well as world No.1 Ashleigh Barty and Belinda Bencic in the Red Group.\n\nPlayers face off against one another in the round-robin format, with the top two in each group progressing to Saturday\u2019s semi-finals.\n\n\u201cI think it should be fun,\u201d she said of Sunday\u2019s match against Kvitova, who she defeated in the final of the Australian Open.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s one of the players, few players, that sort of treat you very nicely after the match no matter if she wins or loses. She always gives you a smile.\n\nOsaka comes into the event off the back of a successful run during the WTA\u2019s Asian swing.\n\nMaintaining her on-court discipline has been key, she said.\n\n\u201cI tried to be as focussed as I could every point, which for me is something very difficult to do because my mind tends to wander a lot. I think you can see it sometimes,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo just continuing that, trying to be as focussed as I can. I think I don\u2019t have much of a choice here because I\u2019m playing against the best players.\u201d", "description": "Twelve months on from her debut appearance at the WTA Finals, two-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka is hoping to put the lessons learned into practice as she looks for an improved performance in the end-of-season tournament.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445124858&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P055", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
