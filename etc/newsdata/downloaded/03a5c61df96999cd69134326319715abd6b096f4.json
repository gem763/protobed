New archeological evidence indicates a firm yes. According to Smithsonian magazine, a recent excavation in the Jamestown Colony in Virginia finally turned up evidence of what\u2019s long been hinted at. During particularly harsh beginnings upon landing in the New World, desperate colonists resorted to human flesh for sustenance. But that\u2019s not the only malady that befell early settlers. Here are some reasons to be thankful you arrived on this continent in the four centuries since.\n\nIt Was Originally All Men\n\nThree shiploads of men docked at Chesapeake Bay on April 26, 1607. Three weeks later, they had settled Jamestown, an unused bit of land the Native Americans had deemed undesirable. The next year, two brave women set foot in the colony, but then it took another 13 years for a crop of young unmarried or widowed women to arrive.\n\nAnd They Couldn\u2019t Get Along\n\nThe crop of men landing at Jamestown were soldiers by trade, and all were accustomed to leadership roles. Soon everyone was butting heads. The famous John Smith barely escaped a sentence to hang, others were accused of hoarding food, some were blamed for an escape attempt, and still others admitted knowledge of spies and plans of rebellion. Within three months, one of the original six councilors was charged with mutiny and executed. The discontent prompted Smith to write a long missive lamenting the mismanagement and corruption within the colony.\n\nThen There Was No Food\n\nThe Jamestown settlers were hardly farmers. In 1609, two years after landing and settling on the tough piece of land, the pioneers faced a brutal famine, bluntly dubbed \u201cThe Starving Time.\u201d\n\nOr Water\n\nThe colonists had seriously bad timing. Landing in spring of 1607, they entered at the beginning of a seven-year drought, which turned out to be the driest period the region experienced in 770 years.\n\nAnd Everyone Was Dying\n\nWithin the first nine months of life in Jamestown, the original 104 ship passengers had dwindled down to 38. A ship stocked with supplies was lost at sea, and the colony\u2019s remaining inhabitants grew desperate. Only a week into their arrival, things began to go awry. Men died \u201cof the boudie Flixe,\u201d \u201cof the swelling,\u201d \u201cof a wound given by the Savages,\u201d and sometimes just \u201csuddenly,\u201d wrote George Percy, who was later president of the colony. Ships of men, 800 in all, set sail to Jamestown in the summer of 1609, but when the last ships arrived less than a year later, there were only 90 colonists left who had survived drought, famine, attacks, and widespread disease.\n\nSo They Ate Each Other\n\nFrom documents written during and after the time, historians gleaned that the desperate settlers may have engaged in cannibalism. \u201cAnd now famin beginneinge to Looke gastely and pale in every face, thatt notheinge was Spared to mainteyne Lyfe and to doe those things which seame incredible, as to digge upp deade corpes outt of graves and to eate them,\u201d Percy wrote. \u201cAnd some have Licked upp the Bloode which hathe fallen from their weake fellowes.\u201d Another testimony describes a man who killed, salted, and ate his wife, and later was executed for the crime.\n\nThe recent archeological discovery is the first confirmation of these written reports. \u201cGiven these bones in a trash pit, all cut and chopped up, it\u2019s clear that this body was dismembered for consumption,\u201d Smithsonian forensic anthropologist Douglas Owsley says of the recent findings. The child was a girl, possibly around 14 years of age, and probably either a maid or daughter of a man arriving on a resupply ship. The bones showed signs of \u201ctentative\u201d blows, but Owsley doesn\u2019t believe she was murdered for food. \u201cIt appears that her brain, tongue, cheeks and leg muscles were eaten, with the brain likely eaten first, because it decomposes so quickly after death,\u201d Smithsonian writes.\n\nAnd There Were Constant Attacks\n\nWithin hours of disembarking their ships, a few dozen of the new colonists were attacked by Native Americans. In those first few months, the attacks didn\u2019t lessen. By November 1610, the Native Americans surrounded the fort and blocked any food supplies from getting in. They were successful\u2014only 60 of the 240 in the fort had survived. And as anyone with the briefest grasp of American colonial history knows, this was just the beginning of years of settler vs. natives brutality on both sides. For the Jamestown settlers, things didn\u2019t get easier for a while. In 1622, just months after \u201cthe first Thanksgiving,\u201d 347 colonists were killed in an attack by Powhatan Indians.", "description": "From cannibalism to the lack of women, Nina Strochlic on why life for the Virginia settlers was horrific.", "authors": ["Nina Strochlic"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492784447/articles/2013/05/02/jamestown-settlers-were-cannibals-and-more-reasons-the-colony-was-hell/130501-jamestown-strochlic-tease_y74ojf", "published_at": "2013-05-02"}
