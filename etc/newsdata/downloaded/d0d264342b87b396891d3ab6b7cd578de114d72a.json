The decision to open up more of the site to tourism comes after Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree in July designating Chernobyl an official tourist attraction.\n\nVisitors attend a tour in the abandoned city of Pryryat, not far of Chernobyl, Ukraine (Rex Features)\n\nA view of a building at the Chernobyl exclusion zone in the abandoned city Pripyat (Rex Features)\n\nHe was at the inauguration of a gigantic dome \u2013 108m high and weighing 36,000 tonnes \u2013 designed to keep the harmful radioactive material contained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We must give this territory of Ukraine a new life,\u2019 Zelensky said at the time\n\n\u2018Until now, Chernobyl was a negative part of Ukraine\u2019s brand. It\u2019s time to change it.\u2019\n\nAfter the disaster in April 1986, a 1,000 square-mile exclusion zone was set up around the Chernobyl power plant. That included the city of Pripyat, a city built for the power plants workers which is now one of the most famous ghost towns in the world.\n\nChernobyl sits at the center of a 1,000 square-mile exclusion zone (Rex Features)\n\nThe result is a wilderness untouched by humans for over three decades.\n\nIn fact, researchers have begun to take an interest in how the area is developing. It was assumed that nothing would be able to survive the high levels of radiation, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\n\nThe TREE (TRansfer-Exposure-Effects) project, led by Nick Beresford, from the UK\u2019s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, set up 42 motion-tripped cameras in the exclusion zone. The project has been monitoring animals in the environment for years and has captured evidence of large mammals like brown bears, bison, wolves, lynxes and horses in the area.\n\n\u2018The CEZ (Chernobyl Exclusion Zone) could be the best area in Ukraine where a large free population of the European bison could be established,\u2019 wrote one of the project\u2019s Ukrainian collaborators in a study explaining their findings.\n\nA visitor walks past graffiti at the Chernobyl exclusion zone in the abandoned city Pripyat (Rex Features)\n\nIf tourism does return to Chernobyl in big numbers, it may pose a threat to the reestablishment of these creatures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadiation is still a real threat (the accident leaked 400 times more radiation than the Hiroshima explosion into the area) but researchers say the wilderness it created should be used for future study.", "description": "But only for five minutes at a time", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89231167_1570699318.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
