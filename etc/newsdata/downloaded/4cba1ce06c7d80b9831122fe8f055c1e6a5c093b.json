The details of this evolving and very Canadian political scandal are difficult to explain. But in brief, it started with allegations that Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office tried to interfere in then-Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould\u2019s investigation into the firm. The important part, for Mr. Trudeau\u2019s brand, is that following the resignation of Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott, a former Treasury Board president, from Mr. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet, the prime minister kicked them out of his party. For many, this was a shocking way to treat two of his most prominent female allies, including the country\u2019s first Indigenous justice minister.\n\nIn Canada, these developments, as well as a host of others, have changed how liberals see Mr. Trudeau. He is far less popular than he was in 2015, a leader despised on the right and often ridiculed on the left.\n\nThese stories, though, rarely made a stir in the United States.

But overall, the American story of Mr. Trudeau as a \u201cdream politician for the left,\u201d as Mr. Minhaj put it, stuck.
