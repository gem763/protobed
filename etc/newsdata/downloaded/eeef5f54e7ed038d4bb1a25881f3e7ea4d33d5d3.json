(Technically, it\u2019s called the \u201cCyber-shot DSC-RX100 VII,\u201d but that\u2019s a name no one will ever use outside of a product catalog.) The new model is the first RX100 to offer an external mic port \u2014 a long-requested addition \u2014 as well as Sony\u2019s real-time tracking and real-time eye autofocus systems that it introduced on the A6400 and A9.\n\nBorrowing some of Sony\u2019s best high-end features\n\nThe lens on the RX100 VII is the same as last year\u2019s model: it\u2019s a 24-200mm zoom lens with an f/2.8-4.5 aperture that offers up to 8.3x optical zoom. The 20-megapixel 1-inch sensor has been upgraded to a stacked sensor using similar technology as the full-frame version that\u2019s found on the A9.\n\nThere\u2019s also a new \u201cSingle Burst Shooting Drive Mode\u201d that takes seven still pictures at up to 90 fps with a single shutter press. It\u2019s designed to give photographers better odds of getting the shot they wanted.\n\nThe most important addition might be the added 3.5mm mic port, which means that content creators will actually be able to use the RX100 VII as an all-in-one device for recording video without having to worry about the poor results from the camera\u2019s onboard mic.\n\nSony seems to know that the RX100 VII is going to be particularly appealing to vloggers: the company will also sell the RX100 VII in a \u201cShooting Grip Kit\u201d that includes the camera, a handheld grip (with active video and photo shutters built in), a microphone bracket (mic sold separately), and two rechargeable batteries. Combine that with the video performance that Sony claims is even better than the already-good RX100 VI and the flip-up screen that can face forward, and you\u2019ve got a pocketable and powerful vlogging machine.\n\nThe RX100 VII will be available later in August 2019 for $1,200 for the camera alone. Later in 2019, the aforementioned Shooting Grip Kit bundle will be available for $1,300. It will be available for preorder at B&H Photo and Adorama later today.", "description": "Sony may have only released the RX100 VI last year, but the company is already back with an updated model called the RX100 VII.
