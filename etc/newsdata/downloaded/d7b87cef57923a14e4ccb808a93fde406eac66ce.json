Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014eventually, cholesterol can cause blockages, which lead to strokes, heart attacks, thrombosis, or other problems. Too much cholesterol in your body is very dangerous. But my point is simply this: If you are taking cholesterol-lowering medicine to protect your heart, you are only treating the symptom, not the underlying causes. What are those underlying causes? Some people talk about diet, but the\n\nIt\u2019s not about being skinny\n\ncholesterol in your diet plays a very minor role in your total cholesterol numbers. Your genes do play an important role. But, in a very real way, they aren\u2019t important at all. You have no control over your genes, so you needn\u2019t pay them much mind\u2014other than to be aware of potential looming problems, as exemplified by your parents and grandparents. Still, there is one factor that towers above all others\u2014and it\u2019s one that you yourself can control. And that\u2019s the amount of fat you carry. Not just any fat, mind you\u2014visceral fat is far worse than any other.The amount of visceral fat you carry is directly related to the amount of good and bad cholesterol you have in your blood. More fat means higher LDL and triglycerides\u2014bad cholesterol\u2014and lower HDL\u2014good cholesterol. But that doesn\u2019t mean being skinny or overweight necessarily tells the full story. Because not all fat is created equal. Visceral fat\u2014the stuff that packs in around your middle, and in between your organs\u2014is much more dangerous than subcutaneous fat\u2014the fat that is just below your skin. Visceral fat increases your risk of diabetes, cancer, and yes, heart disease. Because visceral fat interferes with the proper functioning of your organs, and greatly increases your cholesterol problems. What\u2019s more, visceral fat doesn\u2019t always relate to appearance. You can look skinny, but have plenty of visceral fat around your organs. Likewise, you can appear overweight, but actually not have much visceral fat. Whether you tend to store your fat subcutaneously or viscerally is largely a matter of your genetic makeup. But there\u2019s very good news here. Because no matter how your own body tends to store fat, you can burn away visceral fat through behavior alone. Again, this has nothing to do with your appearance. Whether you are svelte or husky, in order to keep visceral fat at bay, exercise is the key. But not just any exercise. To keep your visceral fat in check\u2014and, by extension, your cholesterol levels\u2014you should use a combination of three types of exercise.\n\n1. Moderate activity\n\n2. Vigorous activity\n\nWhen most people think of exercise, they think of sweat and strain. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. In fact, some of the best exercise isn\u2019t hard at all . And that\u2019s doing moderate amounts of physical activity\u2014everything from taking an afternoon stroll, to gardening. Just get out and move! Doing moderate exercise doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re being lazy. It\u2019s a perfectly good way to stay in shape, and battle belly fat. In fact, many people think that moderate exercise is the best way to burn fat, since it allows your body to immediately tap into fat for energy, during your activity. But it also isn\u2019t an excuse to avoid exertion altogether. If you\u2019re walking, for instance, you want to stay above a 20 minute per mile pace. But as long as you\u2019re being active, you\u2019re in good shape. 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week \u2013 that\u2019s about 20 minutes a day\u2014is what health organizations recommend to stay ahead of visceral fat. It boosts your metabolism, and keeps your body humming along at the right pace.Vigorous exercise doesn\u2019t directly burn fat for energy. You\u2019re going through your energy too quickly, so your body doesn\u2019t have time to convert fat into accessible energy. However, vigorous exercise\u2014like going for a run, or biking faster than 10 mph\u2014burns more energy, much faster. It boosts your metabolism to a greater degree. And it directly exercises and conditions your heart and cardiovascular system. The easiest way to tell if what you\u2019re doing is moderate or vigorous is the talk test. If it\u2019s easy for you to hold a conversation while you\u2019re doing it, that\u2019s moderate exercise. If you run out of breath after a few seconds of talking, that\u2019s vigorous. Because you\u2019re working your body harder, vigorous exercise doesn\u2019t take as much time\u2014around 75 minutes a week will keep you on the right track. Those 75 minutes can replace moderate exercise\u2014though, for the best results, you should try to include both moderate and vigorous exercises every week, to get the best effects from each.\n\n3. Strength training\n\nFor a long time, conventional wisdom thought that strength training\u2014like lifting weights, or doing sit-ups or push-ups\u2014was immaterial to your heart health. But that\u2019s simply wrong. In addition to getting your blood pumping, strength training increases your muscle mass. And larger muscles need more energy\u2014which means they keep you humming along at a higher resting metabolic rate and burn through fat faster. It\u2019s important to stress that strength training doesn\u2019t require fancy gym equipment or big weights. You can get the same effects just by moving your own body weight, like with push-ups. And if you are working with weights, increasing repetitions is more beneficial than increasing the weight you lift. Two or three strength training exercises a week is enough to start seeing great effects\u2014not only in terms of losing weight, but also in gaining energy and, frankly, having your clothes fit you better. But if you can add a little bit of strength training every day\u2014by, for instance, doing sit-ups each morning right after you wake\u2014you\u2019ll be ahead of the game. The best way to combat visceral fat\u2014and its tag-along danger, cholesterol\u2014is to do some moderate and vigorous exercise each week, along with strength training. However, if you haven\u2019t been very active previously, it\u2019s more important to start slow and ramp up over time. You want a program you can stick with for the long haul. And, with a bit of time set aside for exercise every week, your road can be very long, and healthy, indeed.\n\nReferences", "description": "Let\u2019s be clear about one thing straight up: when it .09/02/2019 3:03:13AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
