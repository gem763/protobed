If you're not able to tune it out then it can be a weight on your shoulders.'\n\nPulisic has found himself out of the side for Premier League matches, last starting in the league back on August 31.\n\nMason Mount has cemented himself in the midfield, while Callum Hudson-Odoi is back fit and becomes another option in wide areas.\n\nPulisic has seven appearances in a Chelsea shirt and is yet to score his first competitive goal for the club.\n\nMany believe he will take time to adapt to a new league and a new style of football but that he can go on to show his talents under Lampard.\n\nHe will look to play a role this weekend following the conclusion of the international break as Newcastle visit Stamford Bridge, having upset Manchester United 1-0 last time out.", "description": "The 21-year-old arrived from Borussia Dortmund with big expectations but has so far struggled to make his mark in Frank Lampard's young side and he admits to feeling the weight of expectation.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/15/19746972-0-image-a-46_1571151587471.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
