He Wants His Supreme Court Case to Help Change LGBTQ Rights in America.", "language": "en", "text": "Gerald Bostock relished doing his job. He was proud of helping young people. Until 2013 he worked for Clayton County, Georgia, managing the county\u2019s CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) program, which trained and assigned volunteers to represent children who have experienced abuse or neglect in court proceedings.\n\n\u201cImagine having a job you love, that\u2019s your dream job, and all of sudden losing it,\u201d Bostock, 55, from Doraville, Georgia, told The Daily Beast.\n\nIn 2013, Bostock was suddenly fired by Clayton County. Bostock claims it was because he is gay, the firing coming after it was revealed to colleagues that he played for a local gay softball league. He was also subject to homophobic slurs, he claims.\n\nNow Bostock\u2019s case is one of three historic LGBTQ discrimination cases that will be heard at the Supreme Court on Oct. 8. (The Daily Beast reported on the other two cases, involving former funeral director Aimee Stephens and skydiver Donald Zarda, in detail recently.)\n\nIn all three cases, SCOTUS will consider\u2014and ultimately adjudicate\u2014whether current sex discrimination laws protect LGBTQ people from workplace discrimination.\n\n\u201cFor me it has been extremely emotional,\u201d Bostock told The Daily Beast of the last six years of legal fighting. \u201cI lost my livelihood, and my source of income. I even lost my medical insurance, and at a time I was just recovering from prostate cancer. It\u2019s been a long six-year journey not only to clear my name, but also help make it so no one has to go to work in fear of being fired for who they are, how they identify, and who they love.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers in all three SCOTUS cases claim that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, includes sexual orientation and gender identity, under the \u201csex\u201d classification.\n\nAll three cases represent as momentous a moment for LGBTQ rights and equality at the Supreme Court as the Defense of Marriage Act and marriage equality rulings did in 2013 and 2015, respectively.\n\nTwo of the cases focus on gay-related discrimination and will be heard together\u2014Bostock\u2019s and Zarda\u2019s. The case of Stephens, who alleges her employer discriminated against her because she is transgender, will be heard separately.\n\n\u201c This is a landmark case because we\u2019re in a situation where right now in too many parts of the country a gay or lesbian individual can marry their partner on Sunday and then be fired for their sexual orientation on Monday. \u201d\n\nThe cases are being heard against the backdrop of the stymied passage of the Equality Act, which would enshrine anti-LGBTQ discrimination protections in federal law (28 states presently have no protections for LGBTQ employees). The act passed in the House of Representatives but has little chance of getting passed in a Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThomas J. Mew, partner at Buckley Beal in Atlanta and one of Bostock\u2019s attorneys, told The Daily Beast: \u201cThis is a landmark case because we\u2019re in a situation where right now in too many parts of the country a gay or lesbian individual can marry their partner on Sunday and then be fired for their sexual orientation on Monday.\u201d\n\nMew said, \u201cWhat this situation is screaming out for is a uniform federal standard, and application of the law that protects LGBTQ men and women. Whether the individual is protected or not from discrimination should never be contingent on the luck of the geographical draw.\u201d\n\nAs summarized by SCOTUSBlog, Bostock claimed that the county falsely accused him of mismanaging public money, when it really fired him for being gay.\n\n\u201c You can\u2019t consider a person\u2019s sexual orientation without considering his or her sex, and you can\u2019t consider a person\u2019s sex when you\u2019re making an employment decision against them. \u201d\n\nIn the other cases, lower courts have delivered rulings in favor of Zarda and Stephens. But so far in Bostock\u2019s case, a district court ruled that Title VII did not cover sexual orientation, a ruling upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit\u2014and so Bostock has brought his case to the Supreme Court.\n\nBrian J. Sutherland, partner at Buckley Beal and another of Bostock\u2019s attorneys, told The Daily Beast that the \u201cplain language of the Civil Rights Act clearly applies to sexual orientation. You can\u2019t consider a person\u2019s sexual orientation without considering his or her sex, and you can\u2019t consider a person\u2019s sex when you\u2019re making an employment decision against them.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Clayton County, Georgia, told The Daily Beast they would not discuss the case, adding: \u201cWe do not comment on pending litigation.\u201d\n\nJennifer King, executive director of Georgia CASA, told The Daily Beast that the organization was aware of the Supreme Court case \u201cand its potential to further define protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\u201d\n\nKing revealed that Georgia CASA has not had involvement with any resulting legal proceedings, nor been a party to the case.\n\n\u201cGeorgia CASA does not have direct authority in personnel matters at local affiliates; we are not responsible for any hiring or termination decisions,\u201d King wrote in an email to The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cOur focus continues to be on our mission of supporting and providing volunteer advocacy for children experiencing foster care. As a state network of independent affiliates, Georgia CASA embraces the diversity of its volunteers, staff, and supporters and actively works to engage advocates who are inclusive and representative of the communities and children the CASA program serves.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2014led by Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco and Department of Justice attorneys\u2014has argued that Title VII does not include sexual orientation or gender identity, and therefore it is perfectly legal to fire and discriminate against people on the grounds that they are LGBTQ.\n\n\u201cUnfavorable treatment of a gay or lesbian employee as such is not the consequence of that individual\u2019s sex,\u201d the Justice Department argued, \u201cbut instead of an employer\u2019s policy concerning a different trait\u2014sexual orientation\u2014that Title VII does not protect.\u201d\n\nBostock said he was not only immensely fulfilled by his work for Clayton County but also that the program was immensely successful and had received many awards for its work. He received favorable performance reviews. \u201cMy employer loved me doing my job.\u201d\n\nIt was when he joined the Hotlanta Softball League in January 2013 \u201cthat my life started to change,\u201d said Bostock.\u201cNegative comments about my sexual orientation started surfacing, disparaging comments about my participation within the league, and the fact I was promoting the CASA program within what was said to be \u2018the gay community\u2019 of Atlanta.\u201d\n\n\u201c I was completely shocked and devastated. Everything flashed before me in an instant: all my hard work given to the county for 10 years advocating for child abuse and neglect victims, and all my successes and achievements\u2014all of that being taken away from me suddenly because of my sexual orientation. \u201d\n\nBoth the national and Georgia CASA chapters have strict inclusion and anti-discrimination policies, including around sexual orientation, Bostock said. \u201cI did nothing wrong and nothing differently, other than joining a gay softball league,\u201d insisted Bostock.\n\nHe and his lawyer declined to say what anti-gay slurs had been said to him. \u201cI need my day in court in order to do that,\u201d said Bostock.\n\nThe day he was fired, Bostock went to work and his key-swipe no longer worked. His subsequent termination was abrupt.\n\n\u201cI was completely shocked and devastated. Everything flashed before me in an instant: all my hard work given to the county for 10 years advocating for child abuse and neglect victims, and all my successes and achievements\u2014all of that being taken away from me suddenly because of my sexual orientation. The timeline speaks for itself.\n\n\u201cIt was both physically and emotionally draining for me. I was still recovering from prostate cancer. The stress of this alone prolonged my recovery. As I moved through this journey I learned that it was a much bigger issue than just me. Because it is an issue of national importance, I thought someone should make the issue known and bring it to the attention of the courts. I didn\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else. I didn\u2019t want anyone else to experience what I\u2019ve gone through for the last six years.\u201d\n\n\u201c What about children in care who identify as LGBTQ? What kind of message does this case send to them? They have lost a positive role model. They lost somebody they could look up to. I think Clayton County have sent a very homophobic message to them that their lives don\u2019t matter. \u201d\n\nGoing to the Supreme Court and being part of a landmark case was \u201cexciting but surreal,\u201d said Bostock. \u201cThis is no longer about me, it\u2019s about the LGBTQ community that deals with this issue every day throughout our country. Homophobia is not acceptable, and workplace discrimination of any form is just wrong.\u201d\n\nBostock said he was \u201cliving proof\u201d of Clayton County\u2019s homophobia. \u201cBut what about the children still in foster care in Clayton County? We had achieved the benchmark of serving 100 percent of children in care, and it is now my understanding the program is no longer supplying a CASA volunteer for every child in the courts. Those children have become re-victimized.\n\n\u201cWhat about children in care who identify as LGBTQ? What kind of message does this case send to them? They have lost a positive role model. They lost somebody they could look up to. I think Clayton County have sent a very homophobic message to them that their lives don\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cWhat about the gay softball league, and the LGBTQ community within Atlanta\u2014all those wonderful people interested in the program and volunteering? It\u2019s also a very homophobic message sent to that community: \u2018You\u2019re not welcome to participate in the Clayton County court program.\u2019 There are lots of homophobia-related issues at play here, and a lot of victims as a result of it.\u201d\n\nAttorney Sutherland invoked the 1989 SCOTUS case involving Ann Hopkins, a Price Waterhouse employee who sued her employer after she was denied partnership because her firm objected to how she dressed and did her makeup.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hopkins, it made clear that gender stereotyping was as actionable as sex discrimination. \u201cThis also supports the conclusion that sexual orientation discrimination is a form of sex discrimination that is prohibited by the law,\u201d said Sutherland.\n\nThere had also been amendments to the Civil Rights Act, \u201csupporting expansive interpretations of the law,\u201d Sutherland added. \u201cThe Civil Rights Act should be interpreted broadly, and the Supreme Court has recognized that it reaches broadly, and it should be interpreted broadly to include sexual orientation discrimination as a prohibited form of sex discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe present rightward-tilting makeup of SCOTUS does not concern Sutherland.\n\n\u201cWe are confident and expect to be successful. The legal arguments we are making are grounded in the text and history of the law. The right to work is not a political issue. That\u2019s what the Civil Rights Act is about when it comes to discrimination: People need to be judged according to their work performance. This is a straightforward application-of-the-law issue.\u201d\n\nAs an employee, Bostock, said Sutherland, was an \u201cincredibly effective employee developing a program that served at-risk children in the Clayton County juvenile system. He won awards. Nothing changed except he joined a gay recreational softball league.\u201d\n\n\u201c The program I ran had great success, and had national and statewide accolades\u2014and having that passion taken away from you for doing nothing wrong is just hurtful. \u201d\n\nThe case was dismissed without a chance to go trial and so, said Sutherland, \u201ca large part of this is to give Gerald his day in court to show evidence to support his claim\u2014that he was fired because of his sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nBostock\u2019s career in child welfare services ended after he was fired in 2013. He couldn\u2019t get an interview in that field, he said. He has since become a mental health counselor working at Georgia Regional Hospital.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still making a difference, but with adults, not children. I\u2019ve always been a person who wanted to give back and make a positive difference in the community around me, but my passion was working with children, and that was the job I was good at. The program I ran had great success, and had national and statewide accolades\u2014and having that passion taken away from you for doing nothing wrong is just hurtful.\n\n\u201cWorking with children absolutely is and always has been my passion since graduating from college and starting my career.\u201d\n\nBostock\u2019s lack of success in the lower courts has been \u201cdifficult and hurtful,\u201d but motivating to \u201ckeep pushing forward with my legal team. Without the support of my partner as well as my family and circle of friends, I don\u2019t know if I would have had the strength and ability to do what I\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve been by my side the entire time and I love them dearly. They have been a great support and source of strength for me.\u201d (Bostock said he was now cancer-free, and no longer plays softball.)\n\n\u201c I will continue in my fight for equality and equal rights for all. Any American who wants to work and is able to work should have that right without fear of losing their job because of who they are, how they identify, and who they love. \u201d\n\nThis reporter asked Sutherland and Mew if LGBTQ rights and equality would be placed on a surer footing if a piece of law\u2014like the Equality Act, if it ever passes\u2014mentioned sexual orientation and gender identity as specifically prohibited grounds of discrimination.\n\nSutherland reiterated that it wasn\u2019t necessary: The current law prohibited sexual orientation discrimination as a form of sex discrimination.\n\nBostock himself told The Daily Beast: \u201cI will continue in my fight for equality and equal rights for all. Any American who wants to work and is able to work should have that right without fear of losing their job because of who they are, how they identify, and who they love.\n\n\u201cI am proud of who I am, and the man I have become\u2014and I am very proud of the hard work and success I had in Clayton County. Nobody is going to take that away from me. I hope and pray that others have that same self-confidence, and follow this path with me, so we can ensure that nobody goes to work in fear of losing their job.\u201d", "description": "Gerald Bostock\u2019s is one of the landmark LGBTQ discrimination cases SCOTUS will soon hear.
