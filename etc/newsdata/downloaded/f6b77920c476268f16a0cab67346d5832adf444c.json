Yet his spending habits suggest an income way beyond that\n\nUnfortunately, the way he undertook this job was anything but diplomatic.\n\nOne former Royal aide described the Prince\u2019s approach to his new role as \u2018the worst combination of arrogance and stupidity\u2019, while Simon Wilson, who served as deputy head of mission in Bahrain between 2001 and 2005, reported that Andrew was \u2018more commonly known among the diplomatic community in the Gulf as HBH \u2013 His Buffoon Highness\u2019.\n\nFor good measure, Wilson was withering about the entourage that Andrew took everywhere as he fulfilled his new role, and about the cost to the taxpayer.\n\n\u2018The style in which I observed him carrying it [the job] out beggared belief,\u2019 said Wilson.\n\nMost strikingly, in late 2014 Andrew and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, bought a \u00a313 million ski chalet in the upmarket Swiss resort of Verbier. At the same time, he was spending \u00a37.5 million to refurbish Royal Lodge, his home in Windsor Great Park\n\n\u2018He travelled with a team of six \u2013 there was also a 6ft ironing board that he insisted went everywhere he went. It was hilarious to witness the valet struggling off the plane with it and placing the precious object carefully into the minibus.\u2019\n\nIt seems that despite the acute embarrassments, the shady company he keeps and the pointed questions about his activities, Andrew has not modified his behaviour one iota.\n\nEach year the Prince receives a tax-free handout from his mother of \u00a3249,000 to fund his private office, to which he can add a small naval pension of \u00a320,000. Yet his spending habits suggest an income way beyond that.\n\nMost strikingly, in late 2014 Andrew and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, bought a \u00a313 million ski chalet in the upmarket Swiss resort of Verbier.\n\nAt the same time, he was spending \u00a37.5 million to refurbish Royal Lodge, his home in Windsor Great Park.\n\nNor was he scrimping on personal possessions. In early 2015, he was snapped wearing the latest 18-carat gold Apple Watch, which would have set him back around \u00a312,000. Unless, of course, that was another \u2018private\u2019 gift.\n\nSo how can someone with the declared income he has possibly afford a Swiss chalet, and to support such an opulent lifestyle?\n\nUnless he has come up trumps in the National Lottery, he is clearly gathering in significant sums that we do not know about.\n\nPeople do not generally hand over large sums to other people out of the goodness of their heart. They generally want something in return.\n\nWe are entitled to be told where Andrew\u2019s hidden wealth has come from, and what he has given in return. If he will not come clean, he should be removed from all Royal duties and become a private citizen.", "description": "NORMAN BAKER: Each year Prince Andrew receives a tax-free handout from his mother of \u00a3249,000 to fund his private office, to which he can add a small naval pension of \u00a320,000.", "authors": ["Norman Baker For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937850-0-image-a-25_1571520482908.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
