The service will launch with over 2,000 films, adding new releases as they finish their theatrical runs in AMC theaters. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nAMC's service comes at a critical point as fewer and fewer people are attending movies \u2014 in the US, ticket sales have declined over the last decade. Although worldwide theatrical box-office numbers continue to hit records \u2014 the 2018 global box office reached a record $41.1 billion, per the MPAA \u2014 domestically ticket sales have slumped long term.\n\nWhile 2018 saw a modest improvement with 1.3 billion tickets sold in the US, up 5% year-over-year (YoY), that's still down from peak attendance of about 1.6 billion in 2002, per the National Association of Theatre Owners. The rise of SVOD services is at least partially to blame for that decline, particularly as services increasingly release films directly onto their platforms: Netflix is releasing 67 new original movies directly to their subscribers in the month of October alone, for instance. But the American public is also turned off by how expensive it can be, with 35% of US respondents citing the cost of ticket being the primary reason for seeing fewer movies and 11% citing the cost of concessions, per Statista.\n\nAMC's new service likely aims to boost the value proposition of its Stubs loyalty program, with the ultimate goal of bringing more people back into its theaters. AMC Theaters On Demand is being positioned as a perk of the chain's customer loyalty program, AMC Stubs, which allows members to see three movies in theaters each month for $20 per month. Members who go to see a movie in theaters will now also receive a free digital version of the same movie via AMC Theaters On Demand.\n\nStubs, which is effectively a more sustainable model of the now-defunct MoviePass \u2014 already has more than 20 million existing members. If this perk can further boost Stubs membership, it will bolster what is already a reliable revenue stream amid uncertain times. It might also grow theater attendance because its members lock themselves in for three movies each month.\n\nThat could have positive externalities for the theater, as Stubs members could convince friends to come with them to any of their three monthly movies. For AMC, developing a pathway to better theater attendance that provides steady revenue and circumvents rising ticket prices may be a promising way of remaining relevant amid an increasingly competitive film environment.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
