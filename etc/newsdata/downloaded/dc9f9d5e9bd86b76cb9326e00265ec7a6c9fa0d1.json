Elizabeth Warren said when asked whether Democrats shouldn\u2019t simply be content to try to remove Trump from the White House in the 2020 election rather than by impeachment.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders said Democrats had no choice but to impeach Trump. \u201cI think in terms of the Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a president of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way not only to a speedy expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.\u201d\n\nBiden, who told moderator Anderson Cooper that his son Hunter \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d by joining the board of directors of the Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma Holdings, said Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the House inquiry was itself impeachable. \u201cI said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report, if they did that they would have no choice \u2014 no choice but to begin an impeachment proceeding which gives them more power to seek more information,\u201d Biden said.\n\nDemocrats debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.

Kamala Harris said Trump has \u201ccommitted crimes in plain sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s shocking but he told us who he was,\u201d Harris said, signaling her support for the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBillionaire climate activist Tom Steyer, who made Trump\u2019s impeachment a top priority even before seeking the Democratic nomination, was adamant that the time had come for Congress to take action.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement because I knew there was something wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country and the voice and will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. Impeaching and removing the president is something the American people are demanding,\u201d Steyer said.\n\nWhile what followed on Tuesday was far less harmonious, the first 15 minutes of the debate were largely debate-free.\n\n\u201cWe have the responsibility to be fearless in the face of his criminality and his lawlessness,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke said.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "At the start of Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate all the candidates agreed that House Democrats were justified in opening an impeachment inquiry targeting Donald Trump.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SE1zgKlOKjPPxSv.Wo1VGw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/0cd718a0-efab-11e9-97df-847a1fc00c78", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
