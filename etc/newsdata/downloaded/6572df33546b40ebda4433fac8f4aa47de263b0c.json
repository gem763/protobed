Today, Sony revealed a new version of the PS4 Pro that comes in a basic shade of white that\u2019s covered in dark handprints, which seems to be a theme in Hideo Kojima\u2019s new game. The real standout feature, though, is the DualShock 4 controller. It\u2019s designed to look like a BB pod, those disturbing baby carriers that Norman Reedus carries around in the game. It has the same translucent yellow look as the in-game object, and Sony says \u201cthroughout the game, you can gently rock the controller to emulate holding the BB pod in your own hands.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a decent deal if you\u2019re looking for a new PS4 and a completely bizarre game to go with it. The 1TB console comes with Death Stranding on Blu-ray and the controller for $399.99. It will launch alongside the game on November 8th.", "description": "On November 8th, Sony will be launching a Death Stranding-themed version of the PS4, which comes with the game, console, and a translucent DualShock controller.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7SJTgj5rSUqz8HziJVyvuMXvsU=/0x15:1014x546/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19229535/Screen_Shot_2019_09_24_at_4.40.10_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
