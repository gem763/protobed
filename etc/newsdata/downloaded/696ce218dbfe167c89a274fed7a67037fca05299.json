But just one day after the start of the new school year, Kristen received the devastating news that she has a cancerous, inoperable tumor on her brain stem.\n\n\"She is very brave,\u201d Kristen\u2019s mother, Liza Fajardo, 43, said of her daughter.\n\nWOMAN'S MASSIVE BRAIN TUMOR DISCOVERED AFTER SHE COMPLAINED OF 'PHANTOM SMELLS' LIKE BURNT TOAST\n\nSince June, Kristen has suffered from headaches, vomiting, and blurred vision. On Sept. 4, the same day she started Secondary school \u2014 which typically begins at age 11 in England and Wales \u2014 Kristen went to see an eye doctor. The ophthalmologist who treated her noticed a \u201cproblem\u201d with her left eye and subsequently referred her to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorks, for an MRI, according to South West News Service (SWNS), a British news agency.\n\nThe scan revealed a tumor \u2014 specifically diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) \u2014 on Kristen\u2019s brain stem. Two days later, Kristen and her family were informed the tumor is inoperable.\n\n\u201cShe is a very sweet girl and caring and loving,\u201d her mother told the outlet. \"When I'm sad she will comfort me. She loves to hug and hugs everyone.\u201d\n\nDIPG tumors are known for behaving aggressively, according to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. Surgery to remove the tumor is rare; the location often prevents surgeons from removing it safely. The survival rate for patients diagnosed with DIPG is low.\n\nTEEN'S BRAIN TUMOR ALLEGEDLY MISDIAGNOSED AS 'ANOREXIA'\n\nIn an effort to shrink the tumor, Kristen is slated to undergo six weeks of radiation and chemotherapy, per SWNS.\n\n\"She is very close to her brother Sean. Her brother is like me, he is heartbroken, too,\u201d Liza said, noting her daughter is no longer in school.\n\n\u201cI'm exhausted, but I just need to stay strong for her.\u201d", "description": "Often described by teachers as an \u201cexemplary student,\u201d 11-year-old Kirsten Fajardo couldn't wait to begin her high school career.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
