It has since been taken down. And while some believe the video was removed after Warner Music Group, the copyright holder of the song, filed a copyright complaint, we all know the truth: Nickelback is part of a deep state conspiracy to harm Trump and get Hillary Clinton installed as U.S. president.\n\nYes, a Twitter spokesperson may have told Gizmodo via email this morning that \u201cper our copyright policy, we respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorised representatives.\u201d And, yes, a third-party app that tracks DMCA takedowns confirms that Warner Music Group requested the song be taken down. But open your eyes, man. You\u2019re not seeing the bigger picture.\n\nAs many Trump-supporting patriots and greasy failsons have pointed out already, Twitter just doesn\u2019t want the world to know about Joe Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine. (Or \u201cthe Ukraine\u201d as Trump acolytes are more likely to say.)\n\nTwitter, a social media giant that has so many legitimate Nazi accounts it\u2019s tough to count, is obviously working hand in glove with Nickelback operatives to support a left-wing agenda and suppress the real scandal here. The fact that Trump asked for dirt on Biden from a foreign leader isn\u2019t the scandal. The fact that Trump has invoked calls for a civil war and accused his rivals of treason isn\u2019t the scandal. The real scandal is that Nickelback is trying to limit the free speech rights of red-blooded Americans \u2014 presumably with funding from George Soros and the Rothschilds.\n\nAmerica-loving patriots continue to upload the altered Nickelback video in protest today, sacrificing everything to make sure that Trump stays in office to continue destroying his \u201cenemies.\u201d And those patriots won\u2019t rest until the meme war against Democan\u2019ts is finished.\n\nBecause it doesn\u2019t matter if another person died in ICE custody this week; it doesn\u2019t matter if Australia, one of America\u2019s closest allies, told Republicans to very diplomatically fuck off; it doesn\u2019t matter if Trump floated the idea of shooting asylum seekers in the legs to slow them down; it doesn\u2019t matter if Trump continues to reshape the judiciary for generations to come; it doesn\u2019t matter if the U.S. is literally the laughingstock of the world after the Finnish President had to endure a press conference with Trump.\n\nNo, what matters is that we expose Nickelback for the deep state conspiracy that it is. Because the Fake News media just hates freedom. And social media companies only love the Democrats.", "description": "Last night, U.S. President Donald Trump posted a meme-y video on Twitter featuring the song \u201cPhotograph\u201d by the rock band Nickelback.
