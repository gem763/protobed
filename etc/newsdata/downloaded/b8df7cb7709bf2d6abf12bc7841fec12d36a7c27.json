Elliott is one of my best mates and Ricky\u2019s passion for the club really appealed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a similar culture to Wigan where you need to be on top of your game at all times. We have players who were literally born to win and won\u2019t accept anything else.\u201d\n\nBateman, who will be joined at Canberra by England team-mate George Williams next season, lives close to Whitehead and has grown accustomed to being stopped in the street for autographs and pictures.\n\nBeing apart from his nine-year-old Millie for several months at a time has been difficult but she has visited with his mother twice this season and Bateman returned home when sidelined through injury earlier this year.\n\nBateman explained: \u201cI got a bit upset on Father\u2019s Day because it was the first time I had been away from Millie on a Father\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cEngland will always be home and I will always be very close to my family, but for the sake of my career I need to be playing over here.\n\n\u201cMillie and the rest of my family understand that and to now be playing at near the top of my game in Australia is what you dream of as a kid but never think it will come true.\n\n\u201cBut then again, why not have these kind of dreams? As I\u2019ve shown, they might come true.\u201d", "description": "John Bateman\u2019s rags-to-riches rise has already proved to be beyond remarkable, but life could be about to get better still for the uncompromising Canberra Raiders and England forward.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u1RbhER8Nqx3lTG2A_lbPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwMA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IojR8NNWmqfi9d3Fe6LxWQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00ODA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/66ee5b6f7d846f2479cc4995f40d9036", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
