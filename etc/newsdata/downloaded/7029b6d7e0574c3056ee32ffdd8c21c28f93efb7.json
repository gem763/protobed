It wasn\u2019t the contention that climate change is the greatest threat since World War II. It wasn\u2019t even the fantastical hypothesis that hurricanes are racist because they target \u201ccommunities of color\u201d more than white areas.\n\nNo, the dumbest (and most dangerous) idea was a rehash of the widely discredited authoritarian idea from the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 population control. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked by a school teacher whether it would even be possible to fight global warming given that \u201cthe world\u2019s population has doubled over the last 50 years.\u201d Would the senator be \u201ccourageous enough to discuss curbing population growth\u201d as part of his climate plan.\n\nMr. Sanders obediently blurted out \u201cabsolutely yes\u201d and then meandered into a discussion about a woman\u2019s right to choose and better access to birth control.\n\nHere we go again. In the 1960s, biologist Paul Ehrlich of Stanford became the patron saint of the modern population control movement with his mega-best seller \u201cThe Population Bomb.\u201d That book \u2014 which argued that the world was overpopulated by more than 1 billion people and that the only way to save the planet from environmental doomsday was to force people to have fewer children \u2014 became the rallying cry for Stalinistic population control measures around the world.\n\nThis led to tens of millions of forced abortions, involuntary sterilization programs, forced contraception and even homicidal infanticide \u2014 all in the name of saving the planet.\n\nChina took the population control crusade to a whole new level when it instituted its notorious one-child policy. To this day there are tens of millions of females demographically missing in China. The homicidal environmental policy was cheered on by the United Nations and many of the same left-wing activists and organizations that preach \u201creproductive freedom\u201d and women\u2019s rights. Similarly brutish population control programs were implemented in Africa, India, Egypt and many South American nations. To save the planet, babies had to be prevented.\n\nFortunately, scholars like the late Julian Simon of the University of Illinois proved that human beings do not deplete the world\u2019s resources, but help discover and create them. A larger number of human beings \u2014 especially when combined with freedom and free enterprise \u2014 leave the planet materially and environmentally better off not worse off.\n\nSimon also showed that freedom and prosperity are the best forms of contraception. Population growth happened because we found ways to conquer early death \u2014 with infant mortality rates falling by 70 percent and 80 percent \u2014 and eradicate killer diseases like small pox and tuberculosis.\n\nThe Malthusians were not just immoral; they were dead wrong on their population projections.\n\nAll of those population forecasting models that predicted standing room only on the planet over the next 25-50 years were lies. In the 1970s, the left predicted a population by today of more than 10 billion people. The number is closer to 7.5 billion.\n\nThese doomsday demographic models of the future were about as accurate as the climate change models predicting catastrophic temperature changes have been.\n\nWhat the population control crowd didn\u2019t see happening was that population growth has radically slowed down \u2014 and not because of goverment edicts. As people get richer and freer, couples have chosen to have fewer, but healthier children. In most countries of the world today \u2014 including in China \u2014 the tragedy is not too many children, but too few.\n\nBut at its core the radical greens really do believe that the fundamental problem with the human race is that there are too many of us. People are the pollution. Celebrities like Miley Cyrus and Prince Harry are urging people to have fewer or no kids. Rep. Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez wondered earlier this year whether young women should feel ethically bound to not have children so as to help prevent climate change. At the end of the day, she rejected that lunacy idea, but the very idea that liberals had to ask the question shows how anti-human the left has become.\n\nThis is a fundamentally anti-Judeo Christian ideology that disrespects human life and \u2014 as history proves all too well \u2014 can lead to dastardly consequences for basic human rights and economic progress. Human ingenuity is the solution to. not the cause of. environmental problems, and the constantly changing climate of our planet.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore, a columnist for The Washington Times, is a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation and an economic consultant with FreedomWorks.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
