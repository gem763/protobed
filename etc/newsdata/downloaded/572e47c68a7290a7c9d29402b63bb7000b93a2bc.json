Even devoted readers of literary fiction might quail before novels celebrated for their obscure, metafictional plots. At an appearance last week in Brooklyn \u2014 where else? \u2014 Lerner stated the obvious: \u201cI don\u2019t value accessibility.\u201d\n\nI have bad news for him and good news for us: Lerner\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Topeka School,\u201d is an extraordinarily brilliant novel that\u2019s also accessible to anyone yearning for illumination in our disputatious era. If you\u2019ve been nervously hopping along the shore of Lerner\u2019s work, now\u2019s the time to dive in. As in his previous novels, this story is semi-autobiographical and the structure is complex, but \u201cThe Topeka School\u201d is no Escher sketch of literary theory. Its complexity is beautifully subsumed in a compelling plot about two psychotherapists and their son. As Lerner revolves through these wholly realized characters, we come to know exactly who they are. And as we turn these pages with growing excitement, we know exactly where we are: here, in the middle of a rage-filled country tearing itself apart.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe story takes place in the 1990s in Topeka, Kan., where a high school senior named Adam Gordon is a star on the debate team (as was Lerner). Early in the novel, we follow Adam on a Saturday morning to a tournament in an eerily empty high school. By any standard, this is a contest of no consequence in a remote place involving sweaty kids in ill-fitting clothes spouting off about social programs and nuclear war. But through the wizardry of Lerner\u2019s prose, this battle of adolescent elocution becomes an emblem for the fiery state of American culture.\n\nListen as Adam\u2019s debate partner stands to speak:\n\n\u201cFor a few seconds it sounds more or less like oratory, but soon she accelerates to nearly unintelligible speed, pitch and volume rising; she gasps like a swimmer surfacing, or maybe drowning; she is attempting to \u2018spread\u2019 their opponents, as her opponents will attempt to spread them in turn \u2014 that is, to make more arguments, marshal more evidence than the other team can respond to within the allotted time.\u201d\n\nThat sounds ridiculous, the peculiar practice of an intellectual sport, \u201cless competitive speech than glossolalic ritual.\u201d But the narrator \u2014 a cool, third-person voice that usually shadows the intimate lives of these characters \u2014 suddenly steps back to place this Saturday morning debate in the context of a national plight: \u201cEven before the twenty-four-hour news cycle, Twitter storms, algorithmic trading, spreadsheets, and DDoS attack, Americans were getting \u2018spread\u2019 in their daily lives.\u201d In that flash of lightning, it\u2019s clear that Lerner will do what only great novels can: explore the condition of the whole country in the particular story of a few characters in a small town. If our current political quagmire has taught us anything, it\u2019s the lesson these high schoolers learn in the \u201890s: \u201cThe key was to be a bully, quick and vicious and ready to spread an interlocutor with insults at the smallest provocation.\u201d\n\nAs the story proceeds, Lerner pairs the abuse of rhetoric with a tangential theme about the collapse of language. Adam\u2019s father is a psychotherapist at a vaguely creepy treatment center called the Foundation. (The novel vacillates between demonstrating the usefulness of psychotherapy and satirizing its obsessions.) Dr. Gordon has developed a theory that runs through the novel like a wire: \u201cUnder conditions of information overload,\u201d he speculates, \u201cthe speech mechanisms collapse.\u201d But under that collapse, people\u2019s impulse to express themselves remains, even intensifies, which results in a kind of incoherent howl \u2014 or, in the case of young men, eruptions of violence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nReview: \u2018Fleishman Is in Trouble\u2019 \u2014 and so is modern marriage\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d he says, \u201cencountering more and more patients whose suffering wasn\u2019t clearly related to their circumstances, or whose circumstances were most notable for their normality \u2014 intelligent middle-class white kids from stable homes who were fine until they weren\u2019t: the lost boys of privilege.\u201d Muscle-bound but without any physical labor, oversexed but without any intimacy, pumped full of sugar and images of cruelty, these Peter Pans suffer \u201ca kind of existential gout.\u201d\n\nWe see that suffering periodically in Adam\u2019s behavior, but it\u2019s expressed more brutally by a former classmate named Darren. Poor and mentally impaired, Darren is the novel\u2019s id \u2014 an \u201coff\u201d kid who dropped out of high school but hangs around, desperate for approval from jocks who tease and abuse him. These painful moments read like a recipe for making a school shooter, but they suggest something more prevalent and insidious. The novel opens with a short, impressionistic scene of Darren in police custody, and we revisit his miserable life between each of the longer, fully developed chapters about Adam and his parents. They would seem to live in separate worlds \u2014 the successful, well-educated Gordons and this woolly-minded outcast \u2014 yet the story persistently warns against imagining that such segregation is sustainable, or desirable.\n\nBut perhaps the novel\u2019s most remarkable sections are narrated by Adam\u2019s mother, Jane. Like her husband, she\u2019s a psychotherapist at the Foundation, but she publishes a feminist critique of family life that becomes popular among female readers and notorious among some men. That fame gives Jane a special presence within and without the Topeka community, and it gives Lerner an opportunity to capture the chauvinism that courses through academia \u2014 particularly through psychotherapy. He\u2019s also incredibly discerning about the ways successful women are acculturated to feel guilty about their success and to sabotage one another. (I\u2019m reminded of Taffy Brodesser-Akner\u2019s equally devastating \u201cFleishman Is in Trouble.\u201d) But what\u2019s most haunting is Jane\u2019s sudden awareness of her own son\u2019s capacity for violence in a culture that seems to have lost all honor, drunk on male toxicity. \u201cEvery opponent must be spread,\u201d Lerner writes. \u201cEvery offense, however minor, leads to holocaust.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong the myriad miracles of \u201cThe Topeka School\u201d is that it accomplishes so much, captures so much and questions so much about America in fewer than 300 pages. Here is that all-too-rare masterpiece: a svelte big novel. I\u2019m as awed by Lerner\u2019s artistry as I am by his insight, which seems downright forensic in its ability to trace the pathologies consuming us. When we\u2019re lucky, this is what happens when a talented poet writes fiction: an acute appreciation for concision, a dread of the spread.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\n\nThe Topeka School\n\nBy Ben Lerner\n\nFarrar Straus Giroux. 287 pp. $27\n\nAD", "description": "Lerner has a downright forensic ability to trace the pathologies consuming us.", "authors": ["Ron Charles", "Critic", "Book World"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L0K-Q-yic6KAvE_nsf4_e0d4NB4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SL5CYWHJDYI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
