In the price-be-crazy news, we've seen Bakkt launch its long-awaited Bitcoin futures contracts, but the price of BTC dropped below USD10K, which was followed by a sudden drop to the USD8K level, pulling alts with it. Though the market seems to be recovering, ETH price erased all its gains in September, and XRP dropped to the December 2017 levels. But then, just as Stellar led among the top 10 again-appreciating coins, BTC went below USD8K, and so did alts, but then there was yet another rebound... (To be continued.) And that's not all, as Tron's prices dropped 55% while Sun's trying to reschedule the Buffett lunch, Kin price nosedives after its operator announced the shutdown of Kik App, and Stellar's free XML is either left unclaimed or exchanged for other money. But at least Maduro\u2019s secret \u2018stash\u2019 of cryptos is unlikely to affect BTC price.\n\nMoving on to the exchanges and securities news, where two giant European stock exchange operators made their crypto moves, Binance.US opened for trading and said there's still room for new exchanges in the U.S., OKEx moved to defend itself from wash trading accusations through a BTC 100 bet with its accuser, and Monex Group will hand out BTC to all of its shareholders.\n\nIn the interesting developments section of the news, we learn that Spain\u2019s Balearic Islands may eventually pay for everything they buy in crypto; South Korea plans to welcome blockchain-powered driver's licences; Kraken plans a major change in user experience, Dan Held, Director of Business Development, told us; Blockstream's CSO, Samson Mow, talked to us about Liquid network as the company's main focus and about mining via satellite.\n\nAnd now, we shall proceed to the weekly set of jokes.
