Business Insider Intelligence\n\nThe pilot program will allow customers to have a variety of products, including over-the-counter medications, delivered by drone directly to their doorsteps. Notably, Wing was the first drone operator to be certified by the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) as an air carrier, which is what gives the company clearance to deliver commercial products.\n\nWalgreens' tie up with Wing isn't the first move the retail pharmacy giant has made to improve its delivery services. The company partnered with FedEx last year to launch a next-day shipping service as part of its Walgreens Express program, which Business Insider Intelligence said at the time could help it better compete with other formidable pharmacy players boasting speedy delivery services, such as CVS' CarePass and Amazon-acquired prescription delivery service PillPack.\n\nThis isn't Walgreen's first tie up with a Google-affiliated company either: The pharmacy chain previously partnered with Verily Life Sciences to collaboratively develop a range of health products aimed at improving chronic disease management and medication adherence, cementing Walgreens as a first-choice commercialization partner for Verily.\n\nWe have some reservations about the long-term value of Walgreens' Wing venture, though.\n\nWhile it's true that drone delivery could drastically decrease delivery times for consumers, the tech is still in its infancy and has serious logistical hurdles it will need to clear before it's truly ready for mainstream take-off. For example, Wing's drones require a good deal of open land (like a yard clear of trees and other flight obstacles) to deliver. The need for open space and strict air traffic laws in major urban areas of the US could relegate drone delivery to an interesting novelty, rather than an industry game changer. Because while the tech can and likely will improve, we're skeptical that US regulatory agencies will evolve along with it. So even though Walgreens is right to highlight the strength of its geographic footprint \u2014 approximately 78% of US consumers live within 5 miles of a Walgreens, putting them in range of Wing's 6 mile drone range \u2014 a great deal of those individuals are likely to live in US metropolitan centers, where we doubt lawmakers will allow for a sky full of autonomous flying couriers.\n\nAnd Walgreens will face stiff competition from Amazon, which has been trialing drone delivery services since at least 2013. Fast forward to June of this year, and Amazon's Worldwide Consumer Chief revealed the company's latest drone design at an event in Las Vegas, saying the company's drone delivery program, Prime Air, would be off the ground and serving customers in mere months. Though we don't have optics on exactly how healthcare might fit into Amazon's dream of drone couriers, we think that prescription drug delivery would be a prime use case, considering drones are limited by the amount of weight they can carry, and prescription drugs are light compared with other consumer goods. Further, integrating the drone delivery with PillPack's digital pharmacy platform could be a soaring success in rural communities where individuals may otherwise need to drive long distances to pick up their medications or with elderly folks who may struggle to leave the home. One thing we know for certain though, is that Amazon's technological expertise and massive shipping infrastructure make it a formidable competitor that Walgreens will need to contend with if it wants its drone delivery program to really get off the ground.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
