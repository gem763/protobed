The BEA analyzed prices of \"all consumption goods and services, including housing rents\" and found that \"areas with high/low RPPs typically correspond to areas with high/low price levels for rents.\"\n\nStates with the highest RPPs are Hawaii, New York and California. Sure enough, rental prices in those states are among the highest in the nation. Those with the lowest RPPs are Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama.\n\nTo help put the RPPs into perspective, the Tax Foundation adjusted the value of $100 to show how much it would buy you in every state.", "description": "Data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) shows just how far your money will go in all 50 U.S. states.", "authors": ["Kathleen Elkins"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106180480-1571071521903_t20_9lovjo1.jpg?v=1571071687", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
