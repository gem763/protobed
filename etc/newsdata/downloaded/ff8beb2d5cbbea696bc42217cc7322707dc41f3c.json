Any Bitcoin wallet will do, but having a mobile wallet like Samourai, Blockchain.info, Jaxx, Mycellium or even a paper wallet is the most convenient way. If you want to be sure of your crypto assets security, a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger will do. Find the nearest Bitcoin ATM using a service like CointATMradar or any similar Bitcoin ATM map. Place an order. Approach the machine and follow its instructions. Select Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency of your choice and confirm your order. Mind that some ATM\u2019s may ask you to verify your ID or phone number. Scan the QR code and complete the purchase. Access your BTC wallet and scan your public key using the ATM\u2019s camera. Insert cash into the machine and pay for the order. Receive bitcoins to your wallet. Once your transaction is confirmed, you will receive BTC to your wallet. That\u2019s it!

Buy bitcoin with cash in person\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to rely on any third-party services, then the best way is to find a person to deal with yourself. Place advertisements on local advertisement boards, websites, social media or forums or simply check with your friends.\n\nAlternatively, you can attend your local Bitcoin meetups (check sites like meetup.com) and find like-minded people there. Maybe some of them will want to buy or sell bitcoin with cash.\n\nHowever, remember that safety comes first. Never reveal your actual name or where you live in those advertisements because being known for holding bitcoin is getting increasingly more dangerous.\n\nMaintain low-profile, and always agree to meet with another person in a safe public space, such as a local bank, coffee shop, mall, or other places with many people.\n\n4. Buy BTC with cash using cash deposit service\n\nSome Bitcoin trading platforms offer an option to deposit cash right into seller\u2019s or service\u2019s bank account. Such services include:\n\nLocalBitcoins\n\nWall of Coins\n\nPaxful\n\nBitQuick\n\nAll in all, buying Bitcoins with cash offers more privacy and anonymity compared with centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, but you should also be more cautious of bad actors and scams.
