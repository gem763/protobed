How many people do you know that get their news from Facebook? One or two days after it has trended on Facebook it appears on the major news channels.\n\nPeople use it to keep up with their high school classmates, relatives, friends, fan clubs and so forth. Get recommendations for trades people and much, much more.\n\nI noticed the past three nights that my lovely wife of 45 years was paying less attention to Facebook and more to the new TV shows on the major channels. Looking at the entire trading history of FB I found that prices were often soft in the fourth quarter of each year. No this was not a rigorous scientific study. Nothing quantitative -- just a casual observation.\n\nLet's look at some charts.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of Action Alerts PLUS holding FB, below, we can see that prices peaked in July above $200. Prices turned lower and the indicators have confirmed. FB is below the declining 50-day moving average line and this month prices failed several times at the underside of this line. The rising 200-day moving average line is less than $5 below the market and we could be testing this indicator soon.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a peak in July and weakness since. A weak OBV line tells us that sellers of FB are more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is below the zero line now and in sell territory.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of FB, below, we can see the past three years of price action. Prices have yet to recoup the big decline seen in 2018. FB is in an uptrend and above the rising 40-week moving average line but a test of that line looks possible in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been neutral the past five months or so even though prices made new highs for the move up in July. This is a bearish divergence. The MACD oscillator crossed to the downside in August for a take profits sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of FB, below, we have something for everyone. The chart is projecting a potential upside price target of $222 but we can see that a trade at $175.22 will be a new low for the move down on this chart. A new low would weaken this picture.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Your assignment tonight is to casually observe what your spouse does this evening. Will they watch the new shows on TV or will FB be their evening entertainment? Will they only look at FB during the commercials? I am not looking to start any fights at home. Just curious. Meanwhile, a trade at $175 would test the 200-day moving average line and could precipitate further weakness.", "description": "Technical analysis and strategy on facebook stock....FB", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Will The New Tv Season Get People Off Facebook For A While", "Looking At The Entire Trading History Of Fb I Found That Prices Were Often Soft In The Fourth Quarter Of Each Year.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Peter Tchir", "Gary Berman", "Doug Kass", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/4192c8b4-fa26-11e8-9c69-6b0ae5f73e21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
