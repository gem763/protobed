(Ted S. Warren/AP)\n\nTodd Palin appears to have filed a document suggesting he wants a divorce from Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor who came to nationwide prominence as the running mate of Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008, the Associated Press reported Monday.\n\nThe AP story follows local reports, including an article published earlier in the day by the Anchorage Daily News. The newspaper reported that Alaska\u2019s former first gentleman asked, in a document filed Friday in Anchorage Superior Court, that the couple\u2019s 31-year union be dissolved. The paper reported that Todd Palin cited \u201cincompatibility of temperament between the parties such that they find it impossible to live together as husband and wife.\u201d (In Alaska, \u201cincompatibility of temperament\u201d is frequently cited as a no-fault grounds for divorce, much like \u201cirreconcilable differences.\u201d)\n\nThe news arrives a decade after rumors of marital trouble between the Palins first spread, with a representative referring to the reports as \u201call lies and fabrications.\u201d The Palins, now both 55, married in 1988 and have five children. According to the Alaskan blogger who first reported the Friday filing, the document does not include the couple\u2019s full names, instead referring to them by their initials: TMP and SLP. The divorce filing also reportedly lists the birth date of their only minor child, Trig, born in 2008.\n\nThough the McCain-Palin ticket lost in 2008, Sarah Palin and her family continued to make headlines in the years that followed. The couple\u2019s eldest daughter, Bristol, revealed her own pregnancy, at 17, on the first day of the 2008 Republican National Convention. Now 28, she has since starred on several reality shows \u2014 including, most recently, MTV\u2019s \u201cTeen Mom\u201d franchise. Her parents have also taken reality show turns: After her failed VP bid, Palin starred in the TLC series \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s Alaska\u201d and, later, Sportsman Channel\u2019s \u201cAmazing America With Sarah Palin.\u201d Todd Palin competed on NBC\u2019s \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d in 2012.\n\nIn 2014, several members of the family were involved in a drunken brawl at an Anchorage house party that, per two stories by The Washington Post, left Todd Palin with a bloody nose and Track, Todd and Sarah\u2019s oldest child, shirtless and \u201cbelligerent.\u201d Track Palin told police that the fight started after a few other men were rude to his sisters Willow and Bristol, the latter of whom was accused of punching the homeowner\u2019s face repeatedly.\n\nNo charges were filed in the Anchorage brawl, but the incident set a precedent for legal issues the family would later face. Track, an Iraq combat veteran, was arrested on domestic-violence charges three times between 2016 and 2018.\n\nThe first incident took place in January 2016 \u2014 a day before Sarah Palin was set to endorse then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump \u2014 when Track\u2019s girlfriend called the police to allege that he had punched her in the face and that he had a firearm. Almost two years later, Track was again arrested after an incident at his parents\u2019 home, during which he reportedly hit his father repeatedly in the head. Sarah Palin called the police, saying her son was \u201cfreaking out and on some type of medication.\u201d In September 2018, Track was charged with fourth-degree assault after state troopers said that he had assaulted an unnamed \u201cfemale acquaintance.\u201d", "description": "The couple has been married for 31 years.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "September At Pm", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
