Don\u2019t vote for the other guy. You don\u2019t like me. Don\u2019t vote for the other guy, because the other guy is going to do X, Y, Z. Or the other guy did such terrible things,\" Clinton said on the podcast.\n\nOn \"Daily Briefing,\" Kilmeade responded: \u201cI just think that the more she talks, the more she says things like that, the more she marginalizes herself and makes people glad that they didn\u2019t vote for her.\"\n\nTULSI GABBARD SLAMS CRITICS DURING DEBATE OVER 'DESPICABLE' 'SMEARS' OVER SYRIA, RUSSIA\n\nFurthermore, Clinton floated a conspiracy theory that the Russians are \u201cgrooming\u201d Hawaii congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate Gabbard to be a third-party candidate in 2020, while claiming the 2016 Green Party nominee Jill Stein is \"also\" a Russian asset.\n\nAppearing on Plouffe\u2019s \u201cCampaign HQ\u201d podcast, Clinton did not mention Gabbard by name, though Plouffe ended the podcast by noting Clinton\u2019s \u201cbelief that Tulsi Gabbard is going to be a third-party candidate propped up by Trump and the Russians.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHow you lose defines who you are, and it really reflects poorly on her,\u201d Kilmeade said of Clinton.\n\nFox News\u2019 Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "While Hillary Clinton is back making headlines amid her ongoing feud with 2020 Democratic hopeful Tulsi Gabbard, as well as rumors of her making a late bid to enter the race, Fox news' Brian Kilmeade said the beaten 2016 candidate clearly hasn't moved on from her defeat.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/24/694940094001_6097440194001_6097427963001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
