Gavin Newsom announced that he had signed more than 70 bills \u2014 and vetoed 58 \u2014 on Saturday. They cover a wide range of issues, from health care to school lunches to electric car charging stations.\n\nDescribing the state as \u201ca leader\u201d in issues like promoting animal welfare and moving away from fossil fuels, Newsom said the bills \u201cput intentions into action.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the major issues covered by the new laws:\n\nFossil fuels\n\nSix of the bills relate to fossil fuels and environmental conservation. State entities will be prohibited from providing land for new oil- or gas-related infrastructure on federally protected lands. Oil and gas well operators will be required to provide estimates for the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning production facilities.\n\n\u201cThese reforms and new leadership will enhance safety of existing oil wells, refocus the state\u2019s geologic energy division to better consider public health and fight against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to expand oil extraction in California,\u201d Newsom said in a press release.\n\nMarijuana\n\nSeveral bills signed into law will also touch the marijuana business. One mandates the creation of a universal symbol for cannabis vape cartridge packaging in addition to the required cannabis labeling. Another adds tougher rules for labeling the origin of cannabis in order to prevent the use of misleading names that could confuse consumers about the kind of cannabis.\n\nMarijuana businesses and people working in the industry will be able to deduct business expenses, which is currently not allowed under federal law. The bill only covers the next five years.\n\nAnimal welfare\n\nThe sale of clothes, handbags and shoes made from animals will be banned starting in 2023. It will also be illegal to sell alligator, crocodile, lizard, hippo and caiman skins. Another bill signed into law bans the use of bears, tigers, elephants, monkeys and other wild animals in circuses.\n\n\u201cWe are making a statement to the world that beautiful wild animals like bears and tigers have no place on trapeze wires or jumping through flames,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cJust YouTube the videos showing the cruel way these animals \u2014 often stripped from their mothers as babies \u2014 are trained to do dangerous tricks. It\u2019s deeply disturbing.\u201d\n\nFirearms\n\nA firearms bill expands existing laws for gun storage and requiring gun owners to keep their firearms out of children\u2019s hands. Anyone convicted of breaking these rules would be banned from owning a firearm for 10 years. It came after Newsom also signed new gun sales rules into law.\n\nInsurance\n\nOne bill adds protections for homeowners by requiring insurers to send a notice of nonrenewal 75 days before a policy expires \u2014 up from the current 45 days \u2014 and requires insurers to continue an existing policy for 75 days with no changes from the date the notice is delivered or mailed. It also raises the limit on homeowner insurance claims covered by the California Insurance Guarantee Association from $500,000 to $1 million.\n\nIn a statement, Newsom said he hoped the law will address a rise in homeowner insurance policy nonrenewals, but he wants lawmakers to take more action on it next year.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "The bills cover everything from health care to school lunches to electric car charging stations.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/AP-Gavin-Newsom.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
