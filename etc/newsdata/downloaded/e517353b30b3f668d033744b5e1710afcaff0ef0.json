Ozil has gone on the record to say he wishes to see out his \u00a3350,000-per-week deal, which runs until 2021, and he is said to still enjoy being at Arsenal and is happy in north London.\n\nDuring last night's tense game in the Europa League, Arsenal fans were heard shouting Ozil's name while Unai Emery's side were behind against their Portuguese opponents. Indicating that should the midfield star make his way back into the first team fold, he will be welcomed by Arsenal supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul Scholes has identified Ozil as the man to solve Manchester United's creative problems and believes club officials should try to bring the 31-year-old to Old Trafford.\n\nMLS side LA Galaxy could be a destination for Ozil should Zlatan Ibrahimovic leave the club\n\nPaul Scholes has also said that Manchester United should try to bring Ozil to Old Trafford\n\nSpeaking after United's 1-0 win over Partizan on Thursday night, Scholes told BT Sport: 'I can\u2019t understand that (Ozil's situation at Arsenal). I think he\u2019s a player that can link a team together.\n\n'I think he\u2019s got great quality, he\u2019s shown that in his career, he could be an answer short term, I don\u2019t know. I think that would be up to him.\n\n'I can\u2019t see it happening but I think he is a player that United could do with right now.'", "description": "Mesut Ozil could seek pastures new across the Atlantic as those close to the Arsenal outcast are trying to convince him to end his Arsenal nightmare and head for the bright lights of the MLS.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/18/20189922-0-image-a-12_1572023521127.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
