(Illustration: Benjamin Currie, Gizmodo)\n\nWired has yet another exclusive look at the Sony PS5. This morning Wired\u2019s Peter Rubin detailed a recent visit to Sony\u2019s California HQ where he checked out a dev console, played a few demos, and got a few more details on the PS5 \u2014 including release date and ray tracing facts. But the bulk of the piece \u2014 and seemingly the bulk of the message Sony is trying to convey \u2014 is that solid-state drives are fucking sick.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s run down the non-SSD facts learned. Wired reports they sampled a series of demos on a dev console an awful lot like the one we reported on last week. (Wired asked Sony about the Gizmodo story, which included a tipster\u2019s claims about CPU and GPU performance, but Sony declined to comment.)\n\nThe purpose of the demo was to showcase much improved haptic feedback in the next generation of controllers. Wired\u2019s Rubin reported that \u201c[s]and felt slow and sloggy; mud felt slow and soggy,\u201d when the user moves through the various virtual materials using Sony\u2019s latest controller.\n\nThat improved haptic feedback sounds quite similar to Nintendo\u2019s HD Rumble feature found in Joy-Cons. Hopefully, Sony can get more adoption of the feature than Nintendo \u2014 who has struggled to get HD rumble on anything apart from first-party games.\n\nSony\u2019s Mark Cerny, the lead architect on the PS4, Vita and PS5, also mentioned ray tracing and confirmed that the new console would have hardware-based ray tracing acceleration. This has been theorised for some time, and the chief benefit of hardware ray tracing acceleration versus software tricks is that you can do a whole lot more ray tracing and rely on far fewer hacks.\n\nTypically, there are three sorts of \u201ctiers\u201d of raying tracing. The top tier is full reflection \u2014 rays of light are cast from a source and bounce around the digital scene similar to how real light operates. You can see your character\u2019s reflecting, or even the glare of the sun. The computer has to monitor every individual ray of light from its source to its final point and that\u2019s extremely processor-intensive and really only possible in real-time with hardware acceleration.\n\nSlightly less processor-intensive is shadows. Instead of tracing each ray of light for its entire path, including off of reflective materials, this kind of ray tracing is primarily to make shadows much more realistic. Each ray of light is traced until it meets an obstruction \u2014 person, tree, car, gun, etc. The absence of rays of light then creates far more realistic shadows such as in this Nvidia demo for Shadow of the Tomb Raider. It can be done primarily through software, but it\u2019s far easier to do with hardware.\n\nThe final, and least costly, form of ray tracing is ambient occlusion. You already often see a software-based version of this kind of ray tracing, but its theoretically easier to do with hardware. Ambient occlusion is tracing ambient light from sources to the surrounding room, usually in the form of very soft shadows around objects. Think of the way neon lights in a game might make a whole room glow until you take those lights out.\n\nCerny didn\u2019t mention any of the three kinds of ray tracing, but Laure Miele, chief studio officer for EA, namechecked both ambient occlusion and shadow-based ray tracing before talking about her favourite aspect of the GPU \u2014 its AI component. \u201cMore generally, we\u2019re seeing the GPU be able to power machine learning for all sorts of really interesting advancements in the gameplay and other tools,\u201d she told Wired.\n\nBut for Miele, Cerny, and the handful of developers Sony authorised to speak with Wired, the biggest and coolest new feature of the PS5 is the SSD.\n\nThat is ostensibly a very silly thing to get excited about when these people are talking about a new generation of AI and graphic tools powered by AMD and Sony\u2019s next-generation graphics. Storage drives? Really? That\u2019s the thing EA and studios like Bluepoint Games are stoked about?\n\nBut it does kind of make sense. The console industry has been super slow to adopt fast storage. When the PS4 launched back in 2013 solid-state storage was still pretty costly. A 500GB SSD would have shot up the already high price of the original PS4. That\u2019s why the PS4, as well as the newer PS4 Pro, have relied on traditional hard drives \u2014 specifically 5400rpm drives \u2014 some of the cheapest and slowest drives available.\n\nSony isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s guilty of embracing slow drives to cut costs. Microsoft also packs terribly slow, but big, hard drives into its consoles. Nintendo is the outlier and uses a solid-state drive in the Switch, but the Switch also only has 32GB of onboard storage\u2014about 6-per cent of the storage standard in Sony\u2019s cheapest PS4.\n\nThe problem with this cost-cutting measure is that solid-state storage is typically one of the cheapest and biggest speed upgrades you can put in a laptop or desktop. And the exact same is true for consoles too. Back in 2016 I switched out the 500GB HDD in my PS4 for a smaller SSD and saw my boot times drop by two-thirds.\n\nI have no memory of making this chart, but apparently I did! (Image: Alex Cranz, Gizmodo)\n\nSince 2016 we\u2019ve seen some pretty significant advances in the speed of solid-state drives. Plus the cost of solid-state drives has continued to drop. We\u2019ve also seen AMD improve its support for the faster protocols necessary to take advantage of that speed. Newer SSDs rely on something called Non-Volatile Memory express (NVMe) which relies on the PCIe bus to move data faster than the traditional SATA connectors the PS4 and older laptops and computers rely on. PCIe matters because AMD has made a very big deal about support PCIe 4.0 a brand new version of the PCIe bus that\u2019s so fast very few storage systems can actually take advantage of the speed.\n\nNeither Sony or AMD has suggested that the PS5 will support the kind of speed found in PCIe 4.0. It\u2019s more likely that it will instead rely on the very stable (and still pretty fast) PCIe 3.0 bus commonly found in modern laptops and desktops.\n\nEither way that really is going to be a major speed boost for the PS5. Is it enough to warrant the glowing praise found in Wired\u2019s piece? That remains to be seen. We\u2019ll know by the holidays of 2020 though. That\u2019s when Sony expects to launch the PS5.", "description": "Wired has yet another exclusive look at the Sony PS5.
