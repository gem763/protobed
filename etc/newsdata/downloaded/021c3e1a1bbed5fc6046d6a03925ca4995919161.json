The defenseman is helping make up for the loss of Adam Larsson, who is sidelined by a fractured right fibula.\n\n\u201cThe goals are nice, but he is playing a lot of really hard minutes,\u201d coach Dave Tippett said. \u201cHe is giving us real quality minutes on both sides of the puck. We need him right now with Larsson out. He has come in and really filled the void for us. He was a surprise in camp and now he is a good NHL player right now.\u201d\n\nMike Green scored for Detroit. Coming off a 5-1 loss at Calgary on Thursday night, the Red Wings have lost four in a row to drop to 3-5-0.\n\n\u201cI thought we played pretty good today, just some chances didn\u2019t go in, we hit the crossbar at the end,\u201d Detroit\u2019s Tyler Bertuzzi said. \u201cWe had a good third and we tried our hardest. We dug in, got it deep and played simple in the third, we just didn\u2019t get rewarded.\u201d\n\nNeal scored his NHL-leading ninth goal of the season eight minutes into the second period when a long rebound came out to him. Neal has already surpassed the seven goals he had last season with the Calgary Flames.\n\nBear connected on a point shot 4 minutes after Neal\u2019s goal.\n\nEdmonton also got a solid performance from Koskinen, who improved to 4-0 this season.\n\n\u201cThe main thing for myself is I put everything out there this summer and that builds confidence,\u201d Koskinen said.\n\nGreen scored late in the second. Jonathan Bernier stopped 35 shots for Detroit.\n\nNOTES: Oilers general manager Ken Holland faced his longtime former team for the first time since being hired by Edmonton on May 7. \u2026 The Oilers wore their new third jerseys for the first time.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRed Wings: Host Vancouver on Tuesday night.\n\nOilers: Visit Winnipeg on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ethan Bear is off to a solid start with the surprising Edmonton Oilers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/oilers_red_wings_hockey_81105_c0-175-4200-2625_s1200x700.jpg?0c2ff189453be42a2a9ce3107a20b9190ecec9bb", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
