It seems he\u2019s apologising to everyone, except me.\n\nI accept his public apology, but I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s tried to justify his actions. His case seems to be he was wrong, but I was wrong too. This is quickly turning into a he said, she said situation, but I did not swear at him. That didn\u2019t happen. I told him to stop talking to me, but I never told him to f*** off. If he misheard me, then fair enough. But he showed a massive lack of professionalism in the cage.\n\nWhen Richard Kiely stuck his middle finger up at me, I hadn\u2019t done anything, but he felt the need to give us both a verbal warning. When I was taunting Richard, as I\u2019ve done to all my opponents in my career, he picked me up from a fight-winning position to dock a point. That\u2019s unfair.\n\nMVP clashed with the referee in his last fight (Picture: Bellator)\n\nI never deserved a verbal warning in the first place. It all felt pre-mediated to me, like he\u2019s got some sort of personal issue with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the warning he told me I wouldn\u2019t get away with behaving like that with him. I feel he\u2019s gone in there wanting to pull me up on my style. He may not like the way I fight, but that shouldn\u2019t affect how he referees me.\n\nJohn McCarthy said after the fight he has never had to step in like that, ever. McCarthy is one of the best referees MMA has ever had and he didn\u2019t agree with the calls Dan Miragliotta made. I would like a personal apology, but I\u2019ll be happy if he never referees me again.\n\nMiragliotta admitted he lost his temper with MVP (Picture: Getty)\n\nI don\u2019t agree what I did was \u2018unsportsmanlike conduct\u2019. This is MMA. We\u2019re punching each other in the face. We can do and say anything we like to promote a fight, but once we\u2019re in the cage, suddenly it\u2019s like we\u2019re in school? That, for me, doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nI get kicking someone in the nuts is \u2018unsportsmanlike conduct\u2019, but I can talk to my opponent, if I want. I can taunt him, if I like. It\u2019s all part of fighting. I\u2019m getting in his head. We\u2019re not even miced up, no one can hear what we say to each other.\n\nMy fanbase is built on the style I bring. Now I\u2019m not allowed to fight like that? You can\u2019t encourage pre-fight antics and then turn around and police us like kids in the cage.\n\nMVP is not going to change how he fights (Picture: Bellator)\n\nIf they\u2019re going to tell me I can\u2019t be myself in the cage, then I won\u2019t fight. I won\u2019t repress myself for anyone. I\u2019ll only fight for an organisation who is happy for me to be myself when I fight for them. It\u2019s that or retirement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBellator has always let me be myself and I don\u2019t want that to change. You can\u2019t dictate personalities. This sport is built on personalities.\n\nAll that said, I will 100 per cent be on the London card in November. It\u2019s all sorted, I\u2019m just waiting on an opponent. It won\u2019t be Douglas Lima, obviously, but everyone knows I\u2019m itching for that rematch. I have so much respect for Douglas, but I know I can overturn that result.\n\nChisora is without an opponent for his next fight (Picture: Getty)\n\nDerek Chisora and I are good mates and if I was him I would take myself off that October card now that Joseph Parker has pulled out. Derek shouldn\u2019t be concerning himself with the likes of Otto Wallin, Shannon Briggs or Michael Hunter.\n\nParker is a big fight and I think Derek should wait for him to recover. He had an issue with Eddie Hearn anyway about being co-main behind Josh Taylor and Regis Prograis. Parker is the best fight out there for Derek at the moment and if he beats him he can pick his next opponent.\n\nMORE: When do tickets for Bellator London go on sale?
