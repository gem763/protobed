Steve Daines (R-MT) said during a hearing Wednesday that the federal government has wasted $36 billion in 2018 due to \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d\n\nSen. Daines spoke during a Senate Finance Committee hearing Wednesday on complying with Medicaid eligibility. The Montana Republican senator noted that the federal government loses tens of billions of dollars every year due to waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nAccording to a Montana state legislature audit, Montana is very at risk for Medicaid abuse and fraud due to a number of the state government\u2019s lax compliance policies.\n\nSen. Daines said during the hearing:\n\nOne of the most fundamental responsibilities that we have as United States senators is to uphold the integrity of how taxpayer dollars are spent. As we\u2019ve heard today, the federal government improperly spends over $36 billion in the Medicaid program in fiscal year 2018. The sad reality is that every single one of those dollars that is lost due to waste, fraud, and abuse means a lost investment in improving the health and well-being of vulnerable Montanans.\n\nMontana is only one of seven states that does not verify income data before enrollment. The state also relies on the Obamacare exchange website to determine eligibility, which means that often, many Americans Obamacare qualify for Medicaid when they are truly not eligible.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, a performance evaluation that was done by the Montana legislative audit division had a sample of 100 cases, it showed income errors in self-attested income in 24 percent of cases, that\u2019s in one-in-four,\u201d Sen. Daines noted during the hearing.\n\n\u201cThe discrepancies were not resolved,\u201d he added.\n\nBrian Ritchie, the assistant inspector general for audit services at the Department of Health and Human Services, noted that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS)\n\n\u2026allows too much latitude in the verification plans and doesn\u2019t require things like the use of tax data, doesn\u2019t require frequent wage checks, and those types of things.\n\nSome lawmakers have proposed using contractors to rein in waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid.\n\nRep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) in 2018 told Breitbart News that his legislation, the Freedom to Use Contracted Entities Act, would allow private contractors to make eligibility determinations on behalf of state Medicaid programs \u2013 an idea that could have far-reaching implications for cutting waste, fraud, and abuse throughout federal and state bureaucracies.\n\nStates such as Illinois have hired private contractors, which has allowed the state to save hundreds of millions of dollars by cutting out Medicaid fraud and abuse.\n\nIllinois hired private contractors to find waste, fraud, and abuse in its state Medicaid program; they disenrolled roughly 700,000 fraudulent Medicaid recipients. Based upon projections from Illinois policy, taxpayers could save between $390 t0 $430 million per year, with even greater savings over time.\n\n\u201cOur constituents want us to cut out waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Carter said.", "description": "Steve Daines said during a hearing Wednesday that the federal government has wasted $36 billion in 2018 due to \"waste, fraud, and abuse.\"", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Steve-Daines-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
