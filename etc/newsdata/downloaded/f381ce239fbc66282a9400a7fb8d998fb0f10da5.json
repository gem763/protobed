It is known for hiring inexperienced pilots - most of them recent graduates of its own academy - and for paying them little and working them hard.\n\nThe captain, a 31-year-old Indian national named Bhavye Suneja, was put in charge of piloting the 737 sooner than \"a more conventional airline\" would have, Langewiesche wrote. And, once the 737 was having issues, the Lion Air crew didn't mitigate the failures, according to the article. A few other bizarre happenings communicated Suneja's lack of experience. For instance, he told air-traffic control that he didn't know the plane's altitude.\n\nNYT Magazine also argued in the report that the pilots directing Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which crashed on March 10, had similarly questionable instincts in controlling the 737 Max. As Business Insider previously reported, the copilot in that flight had just 200 hours of flight experience.\n\n\"Two-hundred hours is extremely low,\" Ross Aimer, the CEO of the airline consulting and legal firm Aero Consulting Experts, previously told Business Insider. \"In an emergency, it becomes a problem.\n\n\"If you have a complicated airplane and you basically put a student pilot in there, that's not a good thing,\" Aimer added. \"Even if the guy in the left seat has so much experience, if you have so much imbalance of experience, that can be a problem.\"\n\nAfter a heady analysis of the pilots' actions, former professional airline pilot Langewiesche wrote that these crashes showed \"a textbook failure of airmanship.\"\n\nHe added, \"In broad daylight, these pilots couldn't decipher a variant of a simple runaway trim, and they ended up flying too fast at low altitude, neglecting to throttle back and leading their passengers over an aerodynamic edge into oblivion.\"\n\nThe worrisome conclusion to be drawn from this is that \"thousands of similar crews\" are flying passengers worldwide - and unusual conditions could lead to a fatal ending.", "description": "The Boeing 737 Max has been grounded worldwide for months after two fatal crashes.
