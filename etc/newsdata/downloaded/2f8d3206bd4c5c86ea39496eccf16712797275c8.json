(AP) - A former University of Virginia football player has been convicted of scamming investors out of $10 million.\n\nMerrill Robertson Jr. was convicted Monday of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering.\n\nProsecutors say the 39-year-old Robertson and a co-conspirator operated a Richmond investment agency that sold promissory notes with a promised annual return of up to 20 percent. Instead, they used much of the invested money for mortgage payments, cars, vacations and a luxury suite at a football stadium.\n\nAuthorities say Robertson identified potential investors through contacts he developed playing football at Fork Union Military Academy and at the University of Virginia.\n\nHe was first convicted in 2017, but won a new trial.\n\nSentencing is scheduled for Jan. 3.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A former University of Virginia football player has been convicted of scamming investors out of $10 million.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
