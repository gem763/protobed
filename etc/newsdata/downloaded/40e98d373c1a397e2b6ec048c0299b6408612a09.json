A police van races down the street with its sirens flashing\n\nThere is a makeshift barricade up ahead of the van which appears to have been made out of dustbins and rubbish bags. The van approaches the blockade before ploughing through it without hesitation, scattering debris across the road\n\nThe leading van smashes through further barricades up ahead while being followed by a convoy of three other police vans.\n\nAll four vehicles weave their way down the full length of the road and the video ends shortly after.\n\nThe protests have been ongoing since Monday following a judgement by the Supreme Court that thrust the Catalan dispute back to the heart of political debate.\n\nFreedom marchers from five regional towns had arrived in Barcelona the same day which had also coincided with a general strike in the region.\n\nThe early action prompted the cancellation of flights and the closure of shops, business and top tourist attractions, including the Sagrada Familia basilica.\n\nFootball authorities also cancelled the Barcelona and Real Madrid Clasico match set for October 26 at the Camp Nou stadium.\n\nThe protests rumbled on and regional police began to warn people in a message on Twitter 'not to approach' the city centre.\n\nThe leading van smashes through two further barricades up ahead while being followed by a convoy of three other police vans. All four vehicles then weave their way down the full length of the road, which is where the video ends\n\nAction escalated on Friday when around half a million people rallied in the city centre as political factions continued to clash.\n\nRadical separatists hurled rocks and set off fireworks at police who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nOn Saturday morning, authorities confirmed 152 people had been injured in Barcelona overnight with dozens more hurt in the rest of Catalonia, taking the total to 182.\n\nThe interior ministry said 83 people had also been detained in the overnight violence with a further 128 arrests since the start of the protest.\n\nThese had been the scenes on Friday when around half a million people rallied in the city centre as political factions continued to clash after the Supreme Court jailed nine separatists on Monday over the failed independence bid in 2017\n\nProtesters in Barcelona set fire to cars and large wheelie bins, overturned metal barriers and threw firecrackers at police who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. It is thought 152 were injured in the city centre overnight\n\nRegional president Quim Torra called on the Spanish government shortly after to hold 'unconditional talks.'\n\nHis demands were addressed to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and appeared to be aimed at ensuring that a referendum on independence, that is currently a non-starter for Madrid, was up for discussion.\n\nThe Spanish government replied that it had 'always been open to dialogue in the framework of respect for the law'.\n\nProtests that took place on Saturday, the sixth day of the demonstrations, were seemingly much more people. Protestors sat defiantly in one city centre squares in front of a row of police vans (pictured)\n\nThree hours after the start of the evening (pictured) there was no sign of the sort of violence that racked the city the day before\n\nIt also called on Torra to condemn the violence, 'which he has not done so far'.\n\nMore peaceful protests were held in Barcelona last night with an evening rally and dozens of pro-independence activists formed a human chain between police and protesters at the Urquinaona square in the city centre.\n\nThis morning it appears that Barcelona is beginning to return to relative calm after the six days of clashes.\n\nSpain is currently heading towards a fourth election in as many years which is due to take place on November 10.", "description": "The footage was recorded\u00a0in the city centre as protestors continued to rally against\u00a0a Spanish court's jailing of nine separatist leaders over the failed 2017 independence bid.", "authors": ["Raven Saunt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/09/19950378-0-image-a-43_1571560485488.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
