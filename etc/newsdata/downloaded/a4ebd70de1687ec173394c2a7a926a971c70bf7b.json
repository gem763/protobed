Attached you will see his photo.\n\n\u201cOliver O\u2019Grady, ex-priest, is a convicted paedophile. He is actively seeking victims in our midst.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nO\u2019Grady admitted at the time he was trying to get his history removed from the internet so people would not find out about his crimes.\n\nPornografia de menores, the crime Portuguese police say motivated the arrest warrant, covers a wide range of wrongdoing under Portuguese law.\n\nIt includes using a minor in a pornographic show as well as distributing pornographic material.\n\nPortuguese police were not immediately available for comment this afternoon/yesterday afternoon (THURS) on what the exact equivalent under Irish law would be, or confirmation Oliver O\u2019Grady was the man who had been arrested.\n\nO\u2019Grady\u2019s abuse and Cardinal Roger Mahony\u2019s attempts to hide the crimes are the subject of Amy J Berg\u2019s documentary film Deliver Us From Evil.\n\nIt won the Best Documentary Award at the 2006 Los Angeles Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.", "description": "Oliver O'Grady, the subject of award-winning documentary film Deliver Us from Evil, is understood to have been held on a European Arrest Warrant by Portuguese police", "authors": ["Gerard Couzens", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Pic Collins Courts", "Google Maps", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715806.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Oliver-OGrady-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
