Lindsey Graham a \u201cpiece of s\u2013\u201d in a new podcast set to air Wednesday.\n\nMs. Rice, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013, made the remark during a discussion with two other Obama officials who host \u201cPod Save the World,\u201d Ben Rhodes and Tommy Vietor. In a clip promoted by the podcast Tuesday, Mr. Vietor first called Mr. Graham a \u201cpiece of s\u2013\u201d when talking about his actions following the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand Benghazi to understand [President] Trump,\u201d Mr. Rhodes, who served as former President Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said on the podcast.\n\nMr. Vietor, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s national security council spokesman, responded, \u201cRight, because Lindsey Graham isn\u2019t just a piece of s\u2013 now\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a piece of s\u2013,\u201d Ms. Rice interjected. \u201cI said it. I said it, damn it, finally. He\u2019s a piece of s\u2013.\u201d\n\nMr. Vietor added that Mr. Graham was \u201clying, lying, lying\u201d about Benghazi and \u201craising money off of the death of four Americans.\u201d\n\nDuring the podcast, Ms. Rice also slammed Fox News for making a \u201cvillain\u201d out of her and her handling of the attack.\n\n\u201cNow, on Fox, many years later they just need to say my name and it\u2019s like people start twitching. It\u2019s like an automatic trigger point,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\n\u201cTrump is the master of it,\u201d she added. \u201cHe makes people angry every day.\u201d\n\nMs. Rice is making the media rounds to is promote her new memoir, \u201cTough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For,\u201d which was released earlier this month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
