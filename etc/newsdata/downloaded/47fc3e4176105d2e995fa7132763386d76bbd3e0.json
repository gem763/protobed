Hong, File)\n\nA 4-year-old horse was euthanized after suffering an injury at Santa Anita Park, the historic California racecourse that has garnered widespread attention amid a recent string of equine fatalities.\n\nThe most recent case involves a 4-year-old gelding named Zeke who, according to the Los Angeles Times, was euthanized Monday after working on Santa Anita\u2019s training track, considered to be the facility\u2019s safest surface. Thirty-one horses have died at Santa Anita since Dec. 26, the Times reports, and 30 of those deaths occurred during the track\u2019s winter-spring meeting that ended June 30.\n\nZeke was diagnosed with a pelvic fracture and euthanized at the behest of veterinarians, according to the Times. Before Monday, 1,034 workouts had taken place without incident on the training track.\n\nA message to the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and other major tracks, including Pimlico Race Course in Maryland, was not immediately returned Tuesday evening. The group\u2019s chief veterinarian, Dionne Benson, told the Times that her staff and colleagues were \u201cdevastated\u201d by Zeke\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe are carefully reviewing what factors could have contributed to Zeke\u2019s injury,\u201d Benson said. \u201cSanta Anita will continue to work closely with the California Horse Racing Board and will continue to be transparent with our stakeholders and all of our constituents, including the public, as more facts come in.\u201d\n\n[Breeders\u2019 Cup will remain at Santa Anita, where 30 horses have died since Christmas]\n\nBenson told the Times that the horse\u2019s body will be analyzed by the veterinary medicine school at the University of California-Davis. Those findings, she said, will be reviewed by the California Horse Racing Board.\n\nThe string of horse deaths at Santa Anita prompted officials to temporarily cease racing at the track in early March to establish new regulations \u2014 including limitations on the use of an anti-bleeding medications. The fatalities even drew the attention of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who in April called for all racing at Santa Anita to be suspended \u201cuntil the cause or causes of these deaths can be fully investigated.\u201d\n\nLater that month, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced she would create a task force to investigate the horse deaths. After a 4-year-old gelding suffered an injury during a race in early June and was then euthanized, the CHRB recommended Santa Anita halt racing temporarily but \u201callow horses to continue to train.\u201d That request was met with resistance from the track\u2019s management.\n\nThere was even speculation the spate of deaths would cause the hosts of the Breeders\u2019 Cup, which takes place at Santa Anita in November, to consider a new venue. But the Breeders\u2019 Cup 14-member board of directors voted unanimously in late June to keep the race at its original location, citing \u201cmeaningful and effective reforms and best practices that have been implemented in recent months.\u201d\n\nThe Times reports that it has been 14 weeks since a horse has died racing in the sport.\n\nDes Bieler contributed to this report.\n\nRead More from The Post:\n\nPirates all-star closer Felipe V\u00e1zquez charged with soliciting a minor\n\nA cancer survivor\u2019s historic swim: Four non-stop English Channel crossings\n\nSaints fans cry foul after yet another bad call: \u2018We just want answers\u2019", "description": "The Los Angeles Times reports a 4-year-old gelding was euthanized Monday after being injured at the facility.", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Am", "Michael Brice-Saddler Is A General Assignment Reporter.
