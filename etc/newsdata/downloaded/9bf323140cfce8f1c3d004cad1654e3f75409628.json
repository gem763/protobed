She\u2019s talking using the force of government to make private companies and businesses open their employee books to scrutiny and pay everybody a level deemed fair and equitable by the public sector bureaucrats. That\u2019s been a wish-list item of the left for years; it\u2019s the way Jarrett goes about bringing this wish-list item to light that\u2019s eyebrow raising.\n\nThis is where the LOLs should be inserted.\n\n\u201cAs a young working mom,\u201d Jarrett wrote, \u201cI had a good job, with health insurance, four months paid leave, equal pay with my male peers, workplace flexibility and affordable, excellent child care. Nonetheless, I often felt as though I was holding on by my fingertips as I tried to fulfill my responsibilities at work and at home.\u201d\n\nDid she? Did she really?\n\n\u2018Cause by all historically truthful accounts, those fingertips were pretty darned manicured.\n\nShe was born in Iran to a well-educated, scholarly mother and a pathologist father \u2014 and to a maternal grandfather who happened to be a bigwig housing official in Chicago named Robert Taylor. She attended elementary school in London, an elite private middle school in Chicago, an elite private boarding high school in Massachusetts, Stanford University for psychology followed by the University of Michigan for law.\n\nHere\u2019s how History Makers describes Jarrett\u2019s humble, oh-so-humble life journey: \u201cBeginning her career as a corporate banking associate at Chicago\u2019s Pope, Ballard, Shepherd and Fowle, Jarrett then joined the real estate department of Sonnenschein, Carlin Nath and Rosenthal. In 1987, she was tapped to serve as deputy corporation counsel for finance and development for the city of Chicago under Mayor Harold Washington, and continued service under Mayor Eugene Sawyer and Mayor Richard M. Daley.\u201d\n\nShe served in several cushy spots for Chicago, overseeing budgets of millions and millions, before being elected chair of the city\u2019s Stock Exchange and named president of the Habitat Company.\n\nBut throughout it all, Jarrett maintained devotion to the little people. Hmm. Let\u2019s rephrase: But throughout it all, Jarrett maintained devotion to the little people?\n\n\u201cI often worried about the working families who did not have a safety net of support,\u201d she wrote, in The Hill. \u201cAddressing the policy, political and cultural impediments that prevent working families from thriving has been a top priority of mine for over three decades.\u201d\n\nIf she did care, if she does care, it\u2019s not because of any genuine concern for hard-working Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s because that\u2019s where the control is \u2014 that\u2019s where the power lies.\n\nJarrett no doubt learned early on that the key to the top rests in making the many reliant on the few. So, too, the company with whom she keeps.\n\nBut ask yourself, is it better to teach a person to fish or to give out fish? Or, as the left is even more prone to do, to redistribute the fish?\n\nAnswer: Those with true concern for the \u201cworking families\u201d always go for the teaching moment. It\u2019s the one that brings self-reliance, self-esteem, self-sustenance \u2014 in other words, freedom, over government control.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
