Effectively the government is making money on the back of pensioners.\"\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg has asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate banks for refusing to pass on interest rate cuts in full.\n\nOf the 14 most recent rate cuts, only five had been passed on to customers in full, he said when he announced the inquiry last Monday.\n\n\"There's a pattern of behaviour and the Australian people are fed up,\" he said.\n\n'Pinching from pockets of pensioners'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Henschke said the Pension Loans Scheme \"rip-off\" was adding to anger about the government's refusal to adjust pension deeming rates to reflect multiple changes in the official cash rate.\n\n\"They are balancing the budget to the tune of billions of dollars by pinching from the pockets of pensioners,\" he said.\n\nIn July, the government bowed to demands from seniors groups and announced changes to deeming rates for government welfare payments, including the age pension.\n\nDeeming rates are used to calculate how much a pensioner earns on financial assets such as bank deposits and shares; deemed income feeds into means tests.\n\nThe July change affected 630,000 pensioners, with singles receiving up to $804 a year and couples $1053.\n\nMr Henschke said the cash rate was 2.25 per cent when the current deeming rates were set in 2015, yet they had been altered only once.\n\n\"It's a stealth tax on pensioners\" he said.\n\nThe Pension Loans Scheme allows pensioners and self-funded retirees to tap into the equity in their home to fund a more comfortable lifestyle.\n\nPeople can borrow up to 150 per cent of the maximum fortnightly pension rate.\n\nAMP modelling shows a single person can borrow up to $36,000 a year and couples $54,000, which is paid in fortnightly instalments.\n\nInterest of 5.25 per cent is added to the outstanding loan balance each fortnight until the loan is paid in full, which is usually when the home is sold as part of a deceased estate.", "description": "The Morrison government is charging pensioners an unchanged 5.25 per cent on reverse mortgages even after the Prime Minister accused big banks of \"profiteering\" by not passing on official rate cuts to customers in full.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1f8249401b13ff74ea0607f00479e838e5c68f1e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
