REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger.\n\nLed by the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), the groups on Wednesday said they had formed the Tariff Reform Coalition to urge Congress to wrestle back greater control over trade policy and increase its oversight of the president\u2019s use of tariffs.\n\nTrump, who has dubbed himself \u201cTariff Man,\u201d has imposed or planned tariffs on steel, aluminum and nearly all $500 billion in products imported from China each year, as he pursues an \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy aimed at rebalancing U.S. trade ties.\n\nNFTC President Rufus Yerxa said the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, and lawmakers should ensure that tariffs were used only in exceptional circumstances.\n\n\u201cNot since the 1930s has our country relied so heavily on tariffs in an attempt to pick winners in the U.S. market while overlooking the broader consequences for other industries and our economy as a whole,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe 23 groups outlined their concerns in a letter to the two congressional committees that oversee foreign trade, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that many of the Administration\u2019s tariff actions over the past two years have had significant collateral effects on domestic prices and have led to extensive retaliation against our exports,\u201d the groups wrote, warning that measures still under consideration could inflict further harm.\n\nThe letter was signed by large U.S. trade associations, including the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the National Retail Federation, the Association of Global Automakers, and the American International Automobile Dealers Association.\n\nThe initiative comes as frustration has grown on both sides of the political aisle about the president\u2019s use of unilateral measures to impose tariffs, often citing \u201cnational security concerns,\u201d and to conclude trade agreements with little to no consultation with Congress.\n\nTrump administration officials insist the tariffs on China are paid by the Chinese, but U.S. farmers, retailers, manufacturers and others say the duties are taking a toll on their industries. The measures have also repeatedly roiled financial markets.\n\nThe groups urged lawmakers to carry out a robust review of the president\u2019s policies, and said it stood ready to work on legislation that would curb his authority.\n\nU.S. lawmakers are considering several pieces of legislation that would limit Trump\u2019s authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Trump has used the law to impose the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and to threaten car tariffs against Japan and Europe.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Congress wanted to maximize its role in trade policy, but there was no consensus on how to do that.\n\nAt the same time, he said lawmakers agreed on the need to challenge China, but he was cautiously optimistic about Washington and Beijing eventually reaching a trade agreement.\n\nHe said lawmakers were still waiting for details about a mini-trade deal reached by Washington and Tokyo this week, including whether the White House had the authority to be able to execute such a deal as part of a two-step process.\n\n\u201cBottom line is, we want a comprehensive agreement with Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be weighing whether this first step leads up to the second.\u201d", "description": "Nearly two dozen U.S. lobbying groups have joined forces to try to rein in U.S. President Donald Trump's power to unilaterally impose tariffs amid growing concern about the negative economic impact of his trade policies.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431311625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H1K2", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
