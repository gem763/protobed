State Senate President Mitch Carmichael, a Republican, issued a statement saying the renaming was the handiwork of \u201cCharleston\u2019s elite liberals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are calling on Mayor Goodwin and her liberal allies to end this madness and allow our citizens to freely and fully exercise their Freedom of Religion with a CHRISTMAS PARADE,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder pressure, Goodwin publicly withdrew the name change on Thursday. In a Facebook post, she said \u201cthe kind of vitriol that has come forth\u201d over the secular parade title has been \u201cdisappointing and hurtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter much consideration and conversation with religious leaders from all faiths and community members, we have decided to keep the name, \u2018Charleston Christmas Parade,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe understand the history and tradition of the parade and we want to continue that for years to come.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Amy Goodwin, mayor of West Virginia's capital city, announced on Monday that she planned to rename the \"Charleston Christmas Parade\" the \"Charleston Winter Parade\" to demonstrate that Charleston is an inclusive city.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/AP_17327653993939_c0-176-4268-2664_s1770x1032.jpg?32339fbdfb65f71b9405aa2e3df06427ea777487", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
