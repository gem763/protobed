It might be obsessively hyper-focused on a relatively slight issue or, god forbid, a game taking a political stance. It might be part of a review bomb. It might be a meme. Now, though, Valve has taken aim at one of its system\u2019s more fixable problems: reviews that are out of date.\n\nThese days, people play some games for hundreds or even thousands of hours. Those games evolve over time thanks to updates and community interactions. It stands to reason that somebody\u2019s take on a game might be a little different at hour 567 than at hour five. So now, if you put substantial additional time into a game you\u2019ve reviewed, Steam will ask you to \u201crevise your review.\u201d\n\nAfter users discovered the feature late last week, Steam designer Alden Kroll acknowledged it yesterday on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIn response to dev feedback, this is now a thing!\u201d he said. \u201cDevs have been asking us for this for a while, but we first needed to build the new library before it made sense (technically) to add it.\u201d\n\nKotaku reached out to Valve to find out how many additional hours you have to put into a game for Steam to start asking you to dish out more of your spicy takes, but had not heard back as of this publishing.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what kind of effect this has on reviews, which despite their flaws, are a key metric on Steam and one determining factor\u2014though far from the main one\u2014in how the Steam algorithm decides to display games. Largely, this seems like a change for the better, though in the past I\u2019ve seen developers lament the trend of players who\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours with a game flipping their thumbs-up to a thumbs-down largely because, after so many hours, they\u2019re fed up and burnt out\u2014not because the game is necessarily bad. That hurts smaller games whose main source of reviews is a diehard player base, whose score might get tanked by just a handful of those sorts of reviews. Will this new system bring more of those sorts of players out of the woodwork? Hopefully not.", "description": "There are plenty of reasons to distrust any given individual Steam review.
