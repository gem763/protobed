It\u2019s a boon for those who use Instagram as their primary social media platform.\n\nSo how do you get started on Threads? Here\u2019s a quick guide.\n\nOpening the app\n\nWhen you first download and open the app, the first thing you\u2019re gonna be asked is which account you which to use. Since it\u2019s not uncommon for users to have more than one account, take this opportunity to pick which one you want to use to communicate.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a Close Friends list on your Instagram account already, the next screen is a list of your contacts from which you can select your nearest and dearest. You\u2019ll also have this chance to turn on notifications.\n\nThis is also where you\u2019ll set up \u201cAuto Status.\u201d This setting will reportedly update your status with what it presumes you\u2019re doing based on \u201clocation, movement, battery level, and network connection even when you\u2019re not using the app.\u201d\n\nI declined to turn that on, as it struck me as a little unsettling.\n\nCamera work\n\nThreads allows you to customize your camera with shortcuts. You can select up to eight of your contacts, and their pictures will be on the camera screen. Tapping their icons will allow you to send pictures directly their inboxes.\n\nThe app is camera-first, kind of like Snapchat (because what\u2019s one more thing Instagram steals from Snapchat). When you open the app, you\u2019ll be taken straight to the camera. Once you take pictures, you can edit and filter them the same as you can in classic Instagram.\n\nTo access your inbox, tap the Home icon at the top of the screen. You can call your friends from each inbox by using the camera button. And that\u2019s pretty much all there is to it.\n\nNow you\u2019re all set up with Threads. Anything else you need us to know? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nRead next: Galaxy Fold survives 60 percent of claimed folds in stress test, but that's okay", "description": "Instagram's Threads is the new messaging app specifically for close friends.
