He was then expected to hold a string of meetings with wavering MPs in 10 Downing Street as he attempts to persuade them to back the pact.\n\nThe Times reports efforts to win over Labour MPs are being led by Mark Spencer, the chief whip, and Danny Kruger, Boris Johnson \u2019s political secretary.\n\nBut those Labour MPs also face a showdown with their own Chief Whip - as Labour refuses to rule out withdrawing the whip if they back Boris Johnson.\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell warned he'd \"have a chat'' with deal-backing MP Ronnie Campbell to beg him: \"Please do not give Boris Johnson this power.\"\n\nA Labour source also confirmed to the Mirror that some members of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee have discussed barring deal-backing MPs from standing again in an election.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nSources insisted the idea was only in informal discussion among some members of the NEC and stressed it had not been tabled formally.\n\nIf the deal is voted down in the Commons tomorrow, it will force Boris Johnson to request a three-month delay from the EU by 11pm.\n\nMPs today unveiled three amendments to the deal.\n\nThe most significant would refuse to approve Boris Johnson's deal in final form tomorrow - instead waiting until it's passed through its last vote next week.\n\nTwo SNP amendments will also call for a general election and revoking Article 50 to cancel Brexit.\n\nBut a bid to use Saturday's historic session to secure a second referendum appears to have been dropped - with campaigners looking to next week instead.\n\n(Image: Chris J Ratcliffe)\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nLabour's John McDonnell suggested a better time will be when the EU Withdrawal Act has to pass through the Commons next week.\n\nHe added: \"The government has to bring forward legislation to enact this deal and therefore the timing of any proposals on amendments is critical.\"\n\nLib Dem Chuka Umunna also indicated Saturday is not the time for a second referendum vote, saying: \"The focus tomorrow will be defeating the deal.\"\n\nThe deal is based on a new Brexit plan Boris Johnson sent the EU two weeks ago to replace Theresa May's 585-page Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nThe 64 pages of amendments would keep a transition period which continues EU rules in Britain and payments to Brussels, up to 31 December 2020.\n\nBut they would ditch the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border from 1 January 2021, in favour of a hybrid customs territory that amounts to a border down the Irish Sea - plus Northern Ireland sharing some EU rules with the Republic.\n\n(Image: Xinhua/REX)\n\nBoris Johnson's Brexit deal explained Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on 17 October 2019 - though it stills need approval from MPs and could face a heavy defeat. Today's 64-page draft keeps a transition period up to 31 December 2020 but scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstop's place would effectively be 'two borders': Northern Ireland and Britain would share a customs territory - but EU customs rules will apply to goods entering Northern Ireland that are deemed \"at risk\" of moving into the EU at a later date. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.

I hope he'll get it through parliament, I suspect he will but it will be tight.\"", "description": "The Prime Minister will hold a string of meetings with wavering MPs as he faces a \"tight\" vote to get his Brexit deal through Parliament", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Olivier Hoslet Epa-Efe Rex", "Reuters", "Chris J Ratcliffe", "Xinhua Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20644244.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EU-summit-in-Brussels.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
