And much of it had to do with the Trump administration\u2019s failed attempts to clean up its multiple calamities on the Sunday shows over the weekend.\n\nThe Late Night host began with Trump\u2019s \u201cacting\u201d Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who went on Fox News Sunday to explain why the president announced that he would be holding the G7 conference at his Miami Doral resort in Florida and then reversed his decision after loud protests from both sides of the political aisle.\n\n\u201cHe was honestly surprised at the level of pushback,\u201d Mulvaney said, adding, \u201cAt the end of the day, you know, he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, first of all, he\u2019s not in the hospitality business, he\u2019s the president,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cAnd second, Trump was never in the hospitality business. Hospitality is when you show warmth and compassion to guests and strangers. Trump was in the ruthless-real-estate-asshole-who-stands-like-a-baboon-on-his-hind-legs business.\u201d\n\nLater, Meyers turned to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appeared on ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos and repeatedly refused to acknowledge Mulvaney\u2019s confession that there had, in fact, been a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cYou could see his brain short-circuit in real time,\u201d Meyers said before playing the now infamous of clip of Pompeo trying to dodge the host\u2019s questions until George Stephanopoulos stopped him in his tracks by reminding him of Mulvaney\u2019s admission.\n\n\u201cWow, normally when someone takes that long to answer a question on TV a red \u2018X\u2019 pops up on screen,\u201d Meyers joked, taking on the persona of a game show host. \u201cTop five answers on the board, name a country that the president has colluded with.\u201d As Pompeo sat there silently, he finally said, \u201cSorry, the answer we were looking for was Ukraine.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYou could see his brain short-circuit in real time,\u201d the \u201cLate Night\u201d host said of Mike Pompeo\u2019s TV meltdown.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1433,w_2547,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571717153/SM_52_qbd5kr", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
