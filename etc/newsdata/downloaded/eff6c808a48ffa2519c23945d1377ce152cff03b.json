NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay said, \"I have been distressed by the evidence that has emerged.\" The NSW branch is being investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption over allegations an Aldi bag containing $100,000 cash was dropped off at its Sussex Street head office in 2015. ICAC is also investigating whether some of those attending the Chinese Friends of Labor dinner were used as 'straw donors' to cover-up the alleged donation made by Mr Xiangmo. It was alleged this week Mr Xiangmo asked then general secretary Jamie Clements to set up a meeting with former opposition leader Bill Shorten. Mr Clements claimed he followed through on setting up the meeting but denied he was ever handed a bag of money as a quid pro quo. Mr Albanese has called for the implementation of a corruption watchdog to be implemented at a federal level.
