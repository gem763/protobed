Rachael Bade on the implications of an impeachment probe. And Anthony Faiola describes the human toll and destruction of Hurricane Dorian.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nPeace talks with the Taliban have fallen apart. What happens next?\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that U.S. peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan are \u201cdead.\u201d This comes after news this weekend, when Trump announced that he had canceled a secret meeting at Camp David with Taliban and Afghan leaders, stalling the effort to secure a deal to end the 18-year war and begin a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis decision came after weeks of uncertainty, insurgent violence and a deadly attack in Kabul that killed 12 people, including a U.S. service member. Outside the negotiations, an array of politicians, military leaders and diplomats warned that a hasty deal and troop pullout could lead to chaos and civil war.\n\n\n\n\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton, a vocal critic of the potential peace deal, was omitted from negotiations. He has not opposed reducing the current U.S. troop level to 8,600 \u2014 about the number in Afghanistan when Trump took office \u2014 but rejects any deal with the Taliban. Bolton instead argues the president can simply decide on a reduction without a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt some point, [the president] will say, \u2018This is what I want to do,\u2019\u201d says national security reporter Karen DeYoung . \u201cAnd I believe that will be based not only on what\u2019s happening in Afghanistan, but also on what the political impact is here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t think they should be running forward on something that\u2019s so divisive\u2019\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote this week on a resolution giving itself additional tools to investigate President Trump \u2014 its first formal step toward possibly beginning impeachment proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Democratic base and 2020 presidential candidates increasingly favor an impeachment inquiry, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Democrats in Republican-leaning districts have been reluctant.\n\n\n\n\n\nCongressional reporter Rachael Bade joined other Post reporters in attending town halls across the country. In Pennsylvania, she took the temperature of Rep. Susan Wild\u2019s (D-Pa.) blue-collar, industrial district, which narrowly flipped blue during the last election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cConstituents did ask about impeachment,\u201d Bade says, \u201cand her response was, \u2018I\u2019m a former lawyer, and we don\u2019t have enough evidence yet.\u2019\u201d She says that Wild and other Democrats worry that a likely acquittal by Senate Republicans would give the president a free ride. \u201cThat only empowers him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018We need to get off this island.\u2019 Days after Dorian, the Bahamas still reeling.\n\nHurricane Dorian slammed into the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm on Sept. 1, battering Grand Bahama, the Abacos and other islands for several days.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Faiola , The Post\u2019s bureau chief for South America and the Caribbbean, has been reporting on the aftermath from Marsh Harbour, which was ground zero in Dorian\u2019s path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEverybody is still sort of in shock there,\u201d Faiola says. \u201cThey had seen hurricanes before in those parts, and I think a lot of them felt that it was going to be something on par with the hurricanes they had felt before. But it was the unprecedented nature of the strength \u2014 not even the shelters could withstand the force of the storm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Karen DeYoung explains the collapse of U.S. peace talks in Afghanistan.
