That meant Queer Eye\u2019s Karamo Brown danced the samba to The Lion King\u2019s Simba singing \u201cI Just Can\u2019t Wait to Be King,\u201d The Office\u2019s Kate Flannery did a Mary Poppins-inspired jazz routine to \u201cA Spoonful of Sugar\u201d and the former White House press secretary donned a Woody costume to do a quickstep to Toy Story\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me.\u201d\n\nSpicer had a big smile on his face\u2014and has clearly improved since his debut performance in the season premiere. After heaping some compliments on the dancer, judge Len Goodman warned Spicer, \u201cDon't get overexcited, because there's still a ways to go. However, it was a proper dance, well done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was your best dance!\u201d Carrie Ann Inaba added. \u201cYou were meant to dance a quickstep, as Woody. You give good Woody! It sort of matches your personality. It suited you so well.\u201d\n\nWaiting for his scores to come in, Spicer choked up as he talked about how he had dedicated the dance to his father, who died of cancer shortly after the 2016 election. The emotion was undercut ever so slightly by his preposterous costume.\n\nHe ended up with a 19 out of 30 and his first seven from an individual judge of the competition. \u201cThat's amazing to see that kind of growth,\u201d Spicer said, his voice cracking as he added, \u201cIt's so cool to get those scores tonight.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYou were meant to dance a quickstep, as Woody,\u201d one judge told the former White House press secretary. \u201cYou give good Woody!\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1433,w_2547,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571102458/SS_w6xzcq", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
