Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has steadily gained ground, according to polls. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) rose sharply after the first debate but then gradually slid back into single-digit land. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has held on to his sizable base, while South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has kept most of the support he won in his impressive spring debut.\n\nBut national and state polling shows that the basic shape of the race has remained the same: Biden has a solid lead, and nobody else is particularly close.\n\nIn the RealClearPolitics national poll averages last Friday, Biden was at 28.9 percent \u2014 nearly 12 points clear of his nearest rival, Sanders, who had 17.1 percent support. Warren was right in there at 16.5 percent, and then there was a gap between her and Harris, who had 7 percent, and Buttigieg, at 4.6 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s your top tier, at least for now. Next behind Buttigieg is entrepreneur Andrew Yang, at 2.5 percent, followed by Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke (Tex.), at 2.4 percent each. Everybody else, to be honest, has support that amounts to a rounding error.\n\nFor me, the striking thing is how little the race changed over the summer. Since late May , Biden\u2019s support has never gone below 26 percent \u2014 his nadir after getting sliced and diced by Harris in the first debate \u2014 and no other candidate has climbed as high as 19 percent.\n\nPolls in the key early primary and caucus states tell the same story. The RealClearPolitics average shows Biden with a solid lead in Iowa, a slim lead in New Hampshire, and huge leads in both Nevada and South Carolina. If those numbers hold and he wins all four of those states, it\u2019s pretty much game over.\n\nYou know all the caveats: It\u2019s still early. Every time Biden opens his mouth, there\u2019s the chance of self-immolation. Sanders gets overlooked, perhaps because the novelty from 2016 has worn off, but he remains in second place. Warren\u2019s rise really has been remarkable, and she has a formidable-looking ground game in Iowa, where that\u2019s a real factor. Harris caught fire once and could do it again. Buttigieg is there \u2014 along with others \u2014 if Biden falters.\n\nBut despite relentless coverage of Biden\u2019s \u201cgaffes\u201d \u2014 a word used only by political writers \u2014 he remains the clear front-runner. Some commentators say that\u2019s because people who don\u2019t follow politics for a living haven\u2019t started paying attention, but I disagree. I believe most Democratic primary voters are intensely focused on picking the right candidate to defeat President Trump and end our long national nightmare. I just think voters are making up their own minds about what\u2019s important in Biden\u2019s performance and what\u2019s not.\n\nAt 76 , Biden has to show that he\u2019s still sharp and vigorous enough to vanquish Trump and then serve four years in the most demanding job in the world. In the first debate, he seemed old, tired, at times befuddled. Since then, in my view, he has been much better, though questions remain.\n\nIf Democrats choose Biden, they will have a nominee who can get carried away while telling stories, who can mix up names and dates, who can be a font of malapropisms. His top-tier rivals speak in crisper, more well-formed sentences; heck, Buttigieg speaks in whole polished paragraphs. But as voters decide who\u2019s best to beat Trump and repair the damage he\u2019s done to the nation, I believe they want more than eloquence. I think they\u2019re looking for \u201celectability,\u201d whatever that means; they\u2019re looking for a fighter who won\u2019t back down; and they\u2019re looking for leadership.\n\nThe next debate, on Sept. 12 \u2014 with the 10 leading candidates all onstage at once \u2014 will be the most important to date, and potentially the most pivotal of the campaign.\n\nIt will be the first opportunity to see Biden flanked by his nearest competitors, Sanders and Warren, with Harris and Buttigieg not far from center stage. Any of them could steal the show. Booker, O\u2019Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro or even novice politician Yang might have a breakthrough evening.\n\nBut it also could be that the third debate does what the first two did: make the poll numbers fluctuate but not fundamentally change the shape of the race. Until someone manages to get within shouting distance of Biden in the polls, objectively this race is his to lose.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
