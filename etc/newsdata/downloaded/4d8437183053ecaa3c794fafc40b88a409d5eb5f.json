However, matters were made much worse when he found out that Nate was his biological son \u2014 and Faith (Sally Dexter) knew of his existence.\n\nAfter discovering Moira\u2019s affair via Faith\u2019s meddling, Cain set about seeking revenge \u2014 and he succeeded in getting said revenge when he got into a physical altercation with Nate on a boat. However, the bombshell that he wasn\u2019t prepared for is that Nate\u2019s actually his son.\n\nWith the boat having gone up in flames, Nate and Moira ended up in hospital and, last night, viewers saw Cain unable to forgive his wife for everything that has transpired.\n\nHowever, Faith\u2019s odd behaviour was a cause for concern, and before long it came to light that she had some knowledge of Nate\u2019s existence \u2014 and had prevented mum Cara from getting in touch with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCain struggled to process the news, and tonight, it becomes apparent that he holds Faith responsible for the whole thing \u2014 affair included.\n\nCain and Faith have always had a strained relationship, but the pair had been getting along better lately than they\u2019ve ever done before, but this revelation could prove to be the end for them.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we know that actress Sally will be departing from Emmerdale soon, which means that Faith will be leaving, so could Cain\u2019s feelings towards his mum over keeping Nate\u2019s existence a secret perhaps prove instrumental in the character\u2019s impending exit?\n\nEmmerdale continues Friday 25thOctober at 7pm.\n\nMORE: Cain Dingle discovers the full truth about Nate Robinson tonight\n\nMORE: Can Cain Dingle accept Nate Robinson is his son after boat explosion?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cain was devastated to learn that Nate is his son, but it's Faith he holds responsible and, tonight, he lets her know how he really feels.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Faith-and-Cain-Dingle-in-Emmerdale-df6b_1571992447.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
