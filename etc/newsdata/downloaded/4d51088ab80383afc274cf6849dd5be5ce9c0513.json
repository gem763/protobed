REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nRenault, in which the French government owns a 15% stake, last week kicked off the search for a new leader after ousting CEO Thierry Bollore, hoping new blood will help it repair relations and strengthen a partnership with Japan\u2019s Nissan (7201.T), which has also switched top managers.\n\nThe French state, with a boardroom vote on Bollore\u2019s successor, is open to casting the net wide, junior minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWhen we had to find the best profile for someone to lead Air France, we got someone who is not French - very well,\u201d said Pannier-Runacher, referring to ex-Air Canada boss Ben Smith\u2019s appointment last year at the airline, in which Paris also holds a stake.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best profile that counts here, someone that is able to carry Renault and to play their role in the alliance (with Nissan) at a time of major changes.\u201d\n\nCar companies globally are grappling with slowing auto markets and challenging European emissions regulations, and need to invest in costly new technologies.\n\nRenault hired Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard earlier this year from tyre maker Michelin, after former Nissan-Renault alliance supremo Carlos Ghosn\u2019s arrest in Tokyo on financial misconduct allegations, which he denies.\n\nSenard now has a mandate to get the strained partnership back on track.\n\nInternal Renault candidates with a real shot at the CEO job are likely to be scarce, according to a source close to the recruitment process.\n\n\u201cThe successor will probably be an external candidate, as Ghosn did not prepare anything and left scorched earth behind,\u201d the source said.\n\nAnother person familiar with the process said Renault had some promising people in their 50s at management committee level, but few with enough experience in top executive circles.\n\nALIGNING TEAMS\n\nBollore, who was one of Ghosn\u2019s few protegees propelled to a senior job, hit out last week at his dismissal, calling it a \u201ccoup de force\u201d in a newspaper interview.\n\nPannier-Runacher backed Senard\u2019s bid to renew Renault\u2019s management, however.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a new boss who comes on board, who readjusts and aligns his team, it\u2019s a very basic step and it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Pannier-Runacher said. \u201c(Senard) is doing his job, full stop.\u201d\n\nThe junior minister also said Paris was not against a potential revival of a failed deal to pair Renault up with Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), which withdrew a merger offer earlier this year.\n\n\u201cEverything is open. (But) in the order of things, we\u2019re very clear, we want an industrial project and a reinforced alliance that is serving that industrial project,\u201d she said.\n\nReducing the government\u2019s Renault stake in order to smooth things over with Nissan was not a priority, Pannier-Runacher added.\n\n\u201cYou have to start with the industrial logic, and then you can potentially draw knock-on conclusions for stakeholders,\u201d she said.", "description": "Experience in overhauling a company and a track record in industry will be more important than nationality when carmaker Renault chooses a new chief executive, France's junior economy minister said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441147818&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1BA", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
