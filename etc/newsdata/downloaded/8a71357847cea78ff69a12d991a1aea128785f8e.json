So the way it is sold has to be rigorous and moulded to the buyer\u2019s individual circumstances.\n\nCertainly, on the evidence seen over the past few days, rigour was not something most insurance companies employed, especially when selling annuities to those who had saved with them via one of their pension plans. As a result, many retirees have ended up with annuities not fit for purpose.\n\nIn some cases \u2013 Kathleen Leith\u2019s for example (see above) \u2013 they should never have been sold at all. Of course, the insurance industry \u2013 the perpetrator of this massive financial injustice \u2013 is keen to play down the annuity scandal.\n\nIndividual companies witter on about the fact that sales procedures have now improved. Of course they have, but that doesn\u2019t exonerate insurers from past misdemeanours. If they mis-sold annuities to customers, then these wrongs should be put right \u2013 as is happening now at Standard Life Assurance (part of Phoenix) and Prudential.\n\nPast sins cannot be swept under the carpet. It would be refreshing to hear the Association of British Insurers throw its weight behind our campaign. After all, it\u2019s in its best interests to represent an industry it is proud of. Sadly, despite promptings, it has so far remained stony silent. Asleep at the wheel \u2013 as usual.\n\nWoodford saga\n\nCharles Randell, chair of the Financial Conduct Authority, missed a golden opportunity on Thursday night to demonstrate the regulator is determined to protect the financial interests of investors.\n\nDelivering the keynote speech at the annual dinner of the Investment Association, he could have signalled the regulator\u2019s intention to intervene in the Woodford debacle which is besmirching the reputation of the wider fund management industry.\n\nInstead, he chose to ignore it other than to refer to the \u2018illiquidity\u2019 issues that caused some property funds to suspend dealings in 2016 and Woodford Equity Income to shut its doors in June. What a shame.
