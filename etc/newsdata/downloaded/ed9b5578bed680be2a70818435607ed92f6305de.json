Sullivan said that any argument about Flynn being entitled to additional evidence would need to be in the context of being \u201crelevant and helpful\u201d during sentencing.\n\nPowell replied that \u201cthere is far more at stake here than sentencing.\u201d Powell told the judge that as Flynn\u2019s new lawyers, she and her team had an ethical obligation to review all of the evidence in his case. When Powell argued that there was evidence that they believed exonerated Flynn of being an agent for the Russian government and of violating federal laws that prohibit private citizens from engaging in unauthorized negotiations with foreign governments, Sullivan questioned the relevance, noting Flynn wasn\u2019t charged with those crimes.\n\nPowell replied that those arguments went toward their broader claim that the investigation into Flynn \u2014 an investigation in which he lied to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak \u2014 was based on unfounded claims that he might be a Russian agent or in violation of US law. She also argued the government disclosed too late in the criminal proceedings information about former FBI director James Comey\u2019s role in directing what she characterized as the \u201cambush interview\u201d of Flynn.", "description": "", "authors": ["Buzzfeednews.Com Article Zoetillman Michael-Flynn-Way-Out-Guilty-Plea-Mueller-Investigation"], "top_image": ""}
