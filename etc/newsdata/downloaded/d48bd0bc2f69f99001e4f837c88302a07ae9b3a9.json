Even Ingber concedes that the swamp is organized and resists change. In fact, establishing \u201cteamwork\u201d within the federal work environment is official government personnel procedure, and success and promotions depend on adhering to those group norms. This is all fine, but a tight-knit culture with sensitive and publicly unavailable expertise is exactly what keeps bureaucracy mostly free from real oversight.\n\nGovernment employees all point to the civil service principle that grants them protection from political abuse. But they omit that they in turn, according to the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, \u201care prohibited from using their official authority for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election or nomination for office.\u201d\n\nStill, here was Bill Dudley, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed\u2019s second highest office, brazenly urging leaders to \u201cconsider how their decisions will affect the outcome in 2020,\u201d in an article titled, \u201cThe Fed Shouldn\u2019t Enable Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nLawrence Summers, a former top fiscal official for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, responded that it \u201cmight be the least responsible statement by a former financial official in decades.\u201d And is one really supposed to assume that Dudley wouldn\u2019t have acted that way while in office?\n\nMore well known is what was actually discovered at the equally prestigious FBI when, after public disclosure, its Inspector General found that its top administrators did improperly attempt to affect the 2016 presidential election, a claim supported by former Democratic governor and senator Bob Kerrey, who called for a full investigation. Republican Attorney General William Barr concurred, even characterizing the actions of the FBI as those of a Pretorian Guard.\n\nEven in normal operations, government bureaus often act more as deep states than as public servants. Fifteen hundred IRS and Treasury agents were caught publicly exposing tax returns. Securities and Exchange Commission staff admitted to investigators that their bosses encouraged them to indict the most newsworthy suspects rather than the most clearly guilty even after judicial admonishment.\n\nAnd it is rare that more than token penalties have been assessed for such improprieties. Only 39 percent of the tax leakers were fired. Congress and political executives hardly even try to get to the facts for fear of retaliation.\n\nFormer chairman of the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform Jason Chaffetz just published a book titled The Deep State, which explains the process by which the bureaucracy operates, after abusive leaks by the Secret Service led to his leaving Congress.\n\nChaffetz has proposed legal, oversight, transparency, and civil service reforms, all of which are fine but none of which will really pierce Washington\u2019s impenetrable multi-layered bureaucracy, consisting of millions of employees almost impossible to fire. Yet these workers have the power to enact what the Competitive Enterprise Institute\u2019s Clyde Wayne Crews calls \u201cdark matter,\u201d regulations that do not appear in published form but are binding nonetheless.\n\nYes, there is a deep state. Even a major Brookings Institution report conceded that \u201cthe kudzu that clogs government hierarchies\u201d \u201cmakes even routine decisions risky.\u201d The problem is that it runs too deep for simple solutions to work.\n\nThe original Pretorian Guard proved a disaster for three centuries, and while Claudius might have been some improvement over Caligula, it took a Constantine the Great to disband the Guard. He even moved the capital away to the hinterland, which might not be such a bad idea today.\n\nThe only real solution, though, is to send most domestic programs back to the states and localities where the Constitution once entrusted most of our public functions.\n\nDonald Devine is senior scholar at the Fund for American Studies.
