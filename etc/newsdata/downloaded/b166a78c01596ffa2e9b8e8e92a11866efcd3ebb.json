She will claim that her male equivalent was Jeremy Vine for his work on the BBC\u2019s Points of View between 2008 and 2018.\n\nVine was paid \u00a33,000 an episode of Points of View between 2008 and January 2018, while Ahmed received \u00a3440 per programme of Newswatch, according to Ahmed\u2019s case, the National Union of Journalists said in a statement. This had risen to \u00a3465 in 2015, before being reduced as the BBC switched presenters on to employment contracts.\n\nGender pay gap at its widest for women in their 50s, study reveals Read more\n\nBoth shows were presenter-led programmes of almost 15 minutes and offered the public the opportunity to air their views on BBC content. However, the corporation\u2019s legal team will argue that the two presenters were not doing the same or similar work.\n\nThe presenter has secured an agreement from the BBC for full backdated pay for her work on Radio 4\u2019s Front Row and Radio 3\u2019s Night Waves/Free Thinking, the NUJ said, where the pay gap between Ahmed and male comparators was 50% and 33% respectively.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest According to Samira Ahmed\u2019s case, Jeremy Vine received \u00a33,000 per episode of Points of View.
