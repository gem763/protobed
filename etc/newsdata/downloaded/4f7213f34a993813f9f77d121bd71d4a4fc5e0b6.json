The family will have to figure out whether to go to the U.S. or to France or Portugal to get the drug administered to Pia so that she can be treated for the deadly, muscle-destroying disease, her mother told HLN.\n\nZolgensma is administered through a one-time injection that targets the cause of the rare disease affecting Pia. While it is not a cure, it \"improves muscle movement and function,\" giving children with the disease a chance to live. Otherwise, they would likely die before the age of 2, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the therapy earlier this year.\n\n\"We know very well that it's not possible to fully cure her,\" Pia's mother, Ellen De Meyer, told Belgian broadcaster RTBF. \"But a life in a wheelchair would be already very good.\"\n\nPia's case is very similar to that of the Portuguese baby Matilde, whose family managed this summer to raise money for Zolgensma. The Portuguese authorities paid for the drug in the end, local media reported.\n\nZolgensma, produced by Novartis subsidiary AveXis, is part of the latest generation of individualized therapies and carries a price tag of $2.1 million in the U.S. \u2014 which makes it the most expensive drug in the world. The gene therapy works by delivering a copy of a working gene that is dysfunctional in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).\n\nThe European Medicines Agency is due to issue a decision on approval before year-end, and the drug's hefty price tag has brought the need to find sustainable payment solutions into sharp focus. Zolgensma has faced investigations into manipulated data from tests on mice submitted to both U.S. and EU drugs authorities, but it remains on the market in the U.S.\n\nNovartis defended its U.S. price in a statement on Tuesday, saying that it \"was based on our analysis of treatment as a one-off, transformative therapy for an extremely rare disease. Among other things, we looked at the current cost of chronic SMA therapy for ten years,\" the company said, according to De Standaard.\n\nThe drugmaker didn't give any information about how much the therapy could cost in Europe once approved, according to the same report.\n\nAnother drug for SMA, Spinraza, is reimbursed in Belgium, but, unlike Zolgensma, it has to be administered for the duration of a patient's life.", "description": "Fundraiser marks second drive in Europe for expensive drugs.", "authors": ["Carmen Paun", "Helen Collis", "Sarah Wheaton", "Jillian Deutsch"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-130223321-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
