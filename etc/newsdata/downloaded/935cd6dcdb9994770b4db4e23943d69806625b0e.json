We then take a look at what to expect from streaming TV powerhouse Netflix\u2019s NFLX third quarter financial results on Wednesday, before we close with why Lululemon LULU is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock right now.\n\nAll three major U.S. indexes jumped over 1% through morning trading Tuesday after Wall Street seemed pleased enough with some of the early Q3 earnings results. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo WFC, and Goldman Sachs GS all posted their earnings, with shares of JPM up nearly 4%.\n\nMeanwhile, UnitedHealth stock soared roughly 8% after it lifted its fiscal year profit guidance. The move helped lift the struggling insurance and healthcare powerhouse, which has fallen in 2019, along with the likes of Cigna CI and Anthem ANTM as progressive presidential candidates push policies such as \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nThe positive start to the busy part of earnings season comes as Wall Street assess what\u2019s next in the U.S.-China trade war after the world\u2019s two largest economies reached \u201cphased one\u201d of a deal last week.\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix will report its Q3 results after the closing bell on Wednesday. Shares of NFLX have fallen 20% in the past three months as it prepares to face Apple AAPL, Disney DIS, Comcast CMCSA, and WanerMedia T. But more than anything, investors and Wall Street will be focused on subscriber growth in the short term.\n\nThe episode then ends with a look at Lululemon stock, which has crushed giants Nike NKE and Adidas ADDYY recently and pushed Gap GPS, Target TGT, and others to jump further into athleisure.\n\nToday's Best Stocks from Zacks\n\n\n\nWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?
