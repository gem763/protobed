The accident killed 1,517 people.\n\nThe steam liner sank to a depth of more than 12,000 feet.

Since then, dozens of manned and unmanned submersibles have visited the Titanic\u2019s underwater remains.\n\nRead More: 42 secrets you never knew about the Titanic and the people aboard it\n\nIn August, divers from the Triton Submarines exploration team filmed the wreckage over a series of five dives; it was the first time people had returned to the Titanic in 14 years.\n\nThe expedition captured ultra high-definition 4K footage, which could help researchers create 3D models of the ship, assess the Titanic\u2019s current condition, and make projections about its future.\n\nBecause the Titanic isn\u2019t timeless.\n\nIn fact, scientists think the entire shipwreck could vanish by 2030 due to bacteria that\u2019s eating away at the metal. The following photographs reveal the Titanic\u2019s deteriorating conditions.\n\n\u201cYes, like all things, eventually, Titanic will vanish entirely. It will take a long time before the ship completely disappears, but the decomposition of the wreck is to be expected and is a natural process,\u201d Patrick Laney, president and co-founder of Triton Submarines, told Business Insider.\n\ncaption A photograph of the Titanic\u2019s bow taken during the August 2019 expedition to the wreck. source Atlantic Productions\n\nLaney participated in three of Triton\u2019s five dives in August.\n\nSince Laney had never visited the wreck before, he couldn\u2019t gauge wreck\u2019s condition based on personal observations. But many experts agree that the ship looks very different than it did during previous expeditions.\n\ncaption The manned \u201cNautile\u201d submarine explored the Titanic wreck in 1996. source Xavier DESMIER/Gamma-Rapho/Getty\n\nLaney said the ship is losing a battle against the elements.\n\nDeep-sea currents, salt corrosion, and metal-eating bacteria are whittling away the wreckage, which lies more than 2 miles under the ocean surface.\n\ncaption The bow of the Titanic wreck as it looked in 1996. source Xavier Desmier/Gamma-Rapho/Getty\n\n\u201cThe ship has certainly deteriorated just as one would expect a steel vessel to degrade over time,\u201d Laney said.\n\nMicrobial biologist Lori Johnston told USA Today that much of the deterioration comes from a group of bacteria, named Halomonas titanicae after the ship, which are \u201cworking symbiotically to eat, if you will, the iron and the sulfur.\u201d\n\ncaption Detached rusticles below the Titanic\u2019s port side anchor, 2003. source Lori Johnston/Wikimedia Commons\n\nWhen these iron-loving bacteria munch on the steel of the sunken ship, they cause stalactite-like structures to form on the wreck. These rust-colored icicles are (appropriately) called rusticles.\n\nHenrietta Mann, the scientist who co-discovered these bacteria in 2010, told Time that based on this new expedition footage, the Titanic has only 30 years left before it disappears.\n\ncaption View of the bow of the RMS Titanic photographed in June 2004 by the ROV Hercules during an expedition returning to the shipwreck source Courtesy of NOAA/Institute for Exploration/University of Rhode Island\n\nMann was not involved in the recent dives, but Victor Vescovo, one of the recent expedition leaders, told Time that \u201cthe wreck has been down there 107 years in strong currents and seawater, so it is a matter of not if, but when, the sea will reclaim it in its entirety.\u201d\n\nThe speed of the Titanic\u2019s deterioration increases as the ship\u2019s upper levels crumble, Mann said.\n\ncaption Part of the Titanic wreckage, explored during a dive in 1996. source Xavier Desmier/Gamma-Rapho/Getty\n\n\u201cIf one level deteriorates at the top [of the wreck], it drops to the next one,\u201d she added, \u201cwhich means it \u2026 impacts on the lower levels. Damage is done layer after layer.\u201d\n\nOne such collapse demolished one of the wreck\u2019s most famous sections: Captain Edward Smith\u2019s quarters.\n\ncaption A 1996 photo of the Titanic wreckage shows a bathtub in the ship captain\u2019s cabin.

But given the rate of the ship\u2019s erosion, the panorama is no longer accurate.\n\ncaption People look at a large-scale 360 degree panorama presentation of the Titanic shipwreck on January 27, 2017 in Leipzig, Germany. source Jens Schlueter/Getty\n\nThe 2017 panorama was created by artist Yadegar Asisi and simulates what it\u2019s like to be on the ocean floor exploring the ship 12,500 feet below sea level.\n\nFor his part, Laney said there was nothing surprising about the condition of the Titanic.\n\ncaption A screenshot of Triton Submarines\u2019 expedition footage of the Titanic collected in August 2019. source Atlantic Productions\n\n\u201cI was pleased to see the ship visibly returning to its elemental state as the ocean consumes the vessel over time while providing refuge for a surprising assortment of marine life,\u201d he said.", "description": "Business Insider - For the first time in 14 years, a manned submersible visited the underwater wreckage of the Titanic.
