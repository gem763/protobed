The oldest account in the data set was created almost 12 years ago.\n\n\u201cSuch accounts are readily and cheaply available for purchase from resellers, often for a few dollars or less,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cAccounts in the data set have tweeted in a variety of languages, including Indonesian, Arabic, English, Korean, Japanese, and Russian, and on topics ranging from British football to Indonesian tech support, Korean boy bands, and pornography.\u201d\n\nREAD: A shadowy website is offering big money for Hong Kong protesters to snitch on each other\n\nThe accounts published messages of condemnation of the protesters and support for the police, as well as conspiracy theories about alleged Western government involvement in the protests.\n\n\"Hong Kong SAR police headquarters were surrounded and attacked. Who were the people wearing black?\" one message read. \"They were acting under the direction of Western anti-China forces. They\u2019re manipulating things behind the scenes, with a clear purpose to instigate others to participate in the demonstration and the encirclement. They\u2019re bringing chaos to Hong Kong SAR with an illegal political goal and disrupting the social order.\"\n\nUnlike Russia\u2019s highly sophisticated and coordinated effort to undermine the 2016 U.S. presidential election, this campaign was clumsy and appeared to be hastily arranged as a reaction to the quickly-evolving situation on the ground in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThis was a blunt-force influence operation, using spam accounts to disseminate messaging, leveraging an influence-for-hire network. The predominant use of Chinese language suggests that the target audiences were Hong Kongers and the overseas diaspora,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe messages did not seek to target one particular audience, cultivate a following, or direct readers toward a specific disinformation ecosystem outside of Twitter, but more closely resembled \u201ca marketing spam network,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nREAD: Modi's trolls are ready to wreak havoc on India's marathon election\n\nThe report reveals that some of the accounts used in the campaign against Hong Kong were also active in earlier information operations \u201ctargeting political opponents of the Chinese government, including an exiled billionaire, a human rights lawyer, a bookseller, and protestors in mainland China.\u201d\n\nThe earliest of these operations date back to April 2017, indicating that Beijing has been conducting disinformation campaigns using Western social media platforms for over two years.\n\nCover: A university student wearing safety gear talks during a strike on the first day of school at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, on Monday, Sept. 2, 2019.
