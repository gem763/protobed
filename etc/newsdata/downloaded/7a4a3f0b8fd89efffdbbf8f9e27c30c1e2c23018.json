We have watched the video but it is not necessarily the same match. We are at home and it is going to take a lot of different things.'\n\nThere will be tight security of at the Stade de France ahead of a game which takes place amid escalating diplomatic tensions between the two nations in the wake of Turkey's bombing of Syria.\n\nDeschamps is set to add N'Golo Kante to his injury list after the midfielder pulled up prior to the 1-0 win over Iceland, joining Hugo Lloris, Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba on the sidelines.\n\nA penalty from Olivier Giroud edged an unconvincing 1-0 victory for France over Iceland\n\nTurkey had an equally unimpressive performance last week as they required a last-gasp strike from Cenk Tosun to edge past Albania.\n\nThe two teams are level on 18 points, but defeat for either side could leave them just three points above third-placed Iceland with two games to play.\n\nGunes is convinced the added importance of the game against France will inspired a much-improved performance from his side, and heap pressure on their opponents.\n\nGunes told Turkish media: 'Against France it is important to play our own game and not to focus on the battle for points.\n\n'They want to book a ticket to the finals as soon as possible, and that creates a pressure on them. After all, France are the world champions, and we are playing an away game.'", "description": "France coach Didier Deschamps has shrugged off talk of revenge ahead of his side's potentially crucial Euro 2020 qualifier against Group H rivals Turkey.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/18/19661054-0-image-a-79_1570987011032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
