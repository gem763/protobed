She also will have to pay a $30,000 fine, probated for one year and do 250 hours of community service.\n\nBefore handing down the sentence, Judge Indira Talwani said Huffman knew what she did was wrong and that \u201cshe knew it was a fraud, it was not an impulsive act.\u201d\n\nIn a written statement, Huffman emotionally apologized in court to her daughters and husband, saying she was \u201cstupid\u201d and knew what she was doing was wrong.\n\n\u201cI was frightened, I was stupid and I was so wrong. I am deeply ashamed of what I have done\u2026 I take full responsibility for my actions\u2026 I am prepared to accept whatever sentence you deem fit,\u201d she said.\n\nHuffman\u2019s lawyers argued she was merely a \u201ccustomer\u201d in the scheme and that should shield her from jail time, recommending a year of probation, a $20,000 fine and 250 hours of community service.\n\nAccording to WPRI, federal prosecutors said Huffman \u201cmust go to jail for one month\u201d adding that being a parent \u201cdoes not make you a felon. It does not make you cheat. It does not make you cut corners.\u201d They also recommended the $20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cIn prison, there is no paparazzi. In prison, everyone is treated the same. Everyone wears the same clothes and is subject to the same rules\u2026 Prison is necessary here,\u201d they said.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen responded to a letter Huffman sent to the judge saying she chose to break the law because she was worried about her daughter\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the defendant, welcome to parenthood,\u201d he said.\n\nHuffman said in a letter to the court that she has \u201ca deep and abiding shame\u201d surrounding her decision and only wanted to help her daughter, whose sub-optimal math scores jeopardized her chance of going to an acting college. Her daughter reportedly didn\u2019t know about the scheme.\n\nMs. Huffman is the first of 34 parents charged in the scandal to be sentenced. Some of them paid upwards of $500,000 to help propel their children into elite universities.\n\nHuffman\u2019s sentence could be worrisome for those trying to fight their charges, as she pleaded guilty early, provided full cooperation in court, and was at the lower end of the amount spent.\n\nTwo of those parents, \u201cFuller House\u201d star Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of shelling out half a million dollars for their two daughters to be admitted to University of Southern California as members of the crew team, although neither participated in the sport they were recruited for.\n\nMs. Loughlin and Mr. Giannulli have declined their right to separate attorneys and are scheduled to appear in court Oct. 2.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
