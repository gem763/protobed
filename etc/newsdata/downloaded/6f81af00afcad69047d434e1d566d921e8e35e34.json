Former Massachusetts Governor William Weld, former Illinois Representative Joe Walsh, and former South Carolina Governor and Congressman Mark Sanford are challenging the president. They are truly long shots. Many GOP primary voters don\u2019t know who they are, and those that know them don\u2019t necessarily like them.\n\nThe president appears to overwhelm his rivals in popularity. He also is a prohibitive favorite when the four men are matched against each other. Ten times as many Republican voters would support Trump than would vote for the other three \u2013 combined. Only 7 percent aren\u2019t sure, and 2 percent wouldn\u2019t vote for any of them.", "description": "", "authors": ["Today.Yougov.Com Topics Politics Articles-Reports Republican-Presidential-Challengers-Poll"], "top_image": ""}
