Ice jailed him and gave him ibuprofen\n\nThis asylum seeker was shot in the head. Ice jailed him and gave him ibuprofen\n\nSome days, Rolando would bleed out of his eyes, ears and nose. Other days, he\u2019d lie on the floor, dizzy or barely conscious.\n\nBut every time the jailed Guatemalan asylum seeker sought help from a doctor, staff at his US immigration detention center offered the same treatment: ibuprofen.\n\nThe 27-year-old migrant survived a gunshot wound to the head in Guatemala and was suffering from excruciating headaches and possible brain hemorrhaging when he presented himself at the San Ysidro port of entry earlier this year. US authorities responded by isolating him in solitary confinement and jailing him for months at the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego, giving him sporadic access to medical staff and medicine, his records show.\n\n\u201cI feared I was going to die,\u201d Rolando, who asked not to use his full name due to threats against his life, told the Guardian. \u201cI thought in this country, there is really good medical care \u2026 but I wasn\u2019t getting any treatment.\u201d\n\nRolando made it out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention alive, but his battle isn\u2019t over. He\u2019s still fighting to get asylum, based on the physical torture and persecution he fled as an indigenous Guatemalan. Every step of his journey has collided with the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive attacks and expanding restrictions on migrants and refugees.\n\nNow, the White House is moving to block Central Americans like Rolando from presenting their cases at the border, a move that experts agree will have devastating and fatal consequences.\n\n\u201cI came to the United States because I\u2019d like to at least make it to 30,\u201d Rolando said.\n\nAn orphan who escaped death: \u2018I don\u2019t have anyone left\u2019\n\nWhen he met the Guardian on a recent morning, Rolando carried the charger for his ankle monitor, which asylum seekers awaiting hearings are frequently forced to wear. He\u2019s often worried about it running out of battery.\n\nSeated inside the small legal services office of Al Otro Lado, above a pizza shop in San Diego, Rolando looked down and wove a bracelet with his hands as he talked, a practice he developed inside detention to pass the time and distract from his health problems. His native Mayan language is Q\u02bceqchi\u02bc, but he talks to his attorney in Spanish, which he was forced to speak in jail.\n\nRolando was born into chaos in 1992 in the Pet\u00e9n region of northern Guatemala. His father had been a member of the armed forces but resigned and became a supporter of the pro-indigenous movement. He was killed as a result, just after Rolando\u2019s birth, and his mother died soon after \u201cfrom the trauma\u201d, he said.\n\nTrump's plan for those seeking safe haven: a ticket to the violent heart of Central America Read more\n\nHe was an orphan at age one: \u201cMy brothers and sisters couldn\u2019t take care of me \u2026 and they gave me to neighbors.\u201d\n\nRolando became homeless and later a frequent target of violence by the people who he believes killed his father. Police tortured him when he sought help. According to his asylum application, that included placing nails in his hand and foot and burning his arms with hot knives.\n\nIn 2016, while at a soccer game, assailants shot Rolando in the head and left him with a written death threat that referenced his father\u2019s murder. He survived, was forced into hiding and was unable to get medical attention. He said he had to remove the bullet himself. Police later refused to help and assaulted him, according to his file.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anyone left,\u201d he said, adding that fleeing to the US was his only option: \u201cGiving me an opportunity to be here is giving me an opportunity to stay alive.\u201d\n\nHe escaped to Mexico and joined a caravan last year, eventually making it to Tijuana. Then the waiting began.\n\nAs part of a vast crackdown on migration, border patrol under Trump has instituted a policy known as \u201cmetering\u201d, which limits the number of people who can apply for asylum each day. In Tijuana, this has led to a waitlist that has more than 10,000 people, with a few dozen allowed to cross daily, creating a wait time of roughly six to nine months, lawyers estimate.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy has also resulted in nearly 50,000 migrants from Central America being returned to Mexico while their cases move forward. That has translated to overcrowded shelters, tent encampments and a struggle to access medical and legal services.\n\nIt also leaves migrants like Rolando vulnerable to the same violence they were escaping in their home countries. Rolando said he was beaten in Tijuana, suffering injuries to both his arms and forcing him to wear a cast.\n\nIn February, he was finally able to enter the US through the San Ysidro port of entry. In his initial processing, authorities took his injured arms \u2013 and placed him in handcuffs.\n\nIn detention, in agony and without treatment\n\nOnce he was in custody, Rolando\u2019s health problems worsened. More than 150 pages of Ice\u2019s medical records paint a picture of repeated health crises and his persistent struggle to get help.\n\nRolando regularly was bleeding from his eyes, ears and nose \u2013 the cause of which was unclear to doctors but might have been related to his gunshot wound. Rolando said he was bleeding soon after he was taken into custody and that as a result, he was placed in isolation: \u201cThey said, \u2018We don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many days he spent in solitary, but he said he had difficulty getting any treatment while isolated, and that he would spend all day in a small cell with no window to the outside. Staff would pass him meals through a small slat.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what was night and what was day,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was sick already, but I was starting to get worse \u2026 Nobody was coming to see me.\u201d\n\nOnce in the general population of Otay Mesa, Rolando continued to suffer periodic bleeding, and at times his head pain was so severe, he would lose consciousness, or he would lie on the ground so that he would not injure himself if he passed out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rolando made bracelets and sold them to other detainees so he could buy instant soup, he recalled. Photograph: John Francis Peters/The Guardian\n\nRolando would frequently sign up for \u201csick call\u201d to visit medical staff, but he said the appointments did little to help. Records show that on one visit, a nurse told him to drink more water and \u201cwash hair/head thoroughly\u201d.\n\nEating the facility\u2019s meats also started to make him sick, but he often struggled to get alternative food options, even though the medical staff said he needed to change his diet. Sometimes he made bracelets and sold them to other detainees so he could buy instant soup, he recalled.\n\nThe records show that the main form of treatment Rolando received was prescriptions for ibuprofen \u2013 in increasingly high doses as his pain worsened. Sometimes, he said, he ran out of ibuprofen and had difficulty getting a refill. He also received an ointment for his eyes.\n\nAnne Rios, his attorney with Al Otro Lado, said she was stunned when she was finally able to get a copy of his medical records: \u201cIt seems unbelievable, almost too absurd to be true, but it\u2019s not only documented, it\u2019s the government\u2019s own records.\u201d\n\nBy August, Ice had twice refused to release him while his asylum case was pending even after dozens of medical visits, including multiple to the emergency room. One ER doctor had written that he was a \u201cserious patient that presents with significant complexity of risk\u201d, adding that he might have some kind of brain hemorrhage.\n\nHe had no criminal history or immigration violations.\n\nRolando grew increasingly desperate. At one point, he considered giving up and deporting himself back to Guatemala \u2013 a certain death, Rios said, recalling him telling her on one visit: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m gonna die here or in Guatemala, so I would at least rather go to my home country \u2026 I just can\u2019t take it any more.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter a third request by Rolando\u2019s attorneys, a judge ruled that he could be released \u2013 but only if he paid a $5,000 bond.\n\n\u201cFor many, $5,000 might as well be $5m,\u201d said Rios. \u201cThey come here with nothing, no resources, no family members, absolutely no way to pay for that.\u201d\n\nRolando was only able to get out when Al Otro Lado found a way to cover the amount through its bond fund.\n\nIce declined to comment on Rolando\u2019s case, citing his privacy. A spokeswoman said \u201ceveryone in our custody receives timely access to medical services and treatment\u201d, including a full health assessment with two weeks of custody, daily sick calls and 24-hour emergency care. A dietician ensures detainees\u2019 \u201cunique health (included allergies), dietary, and religious needs are met\u201d for each meal, and all food \u201cmust be visually appealing, palatable, and taste good\u201d.\n\nA final plea: \u2018I followed the rules and I am telling the truth\u2019\n\nRolando struggles to understand why the US has treated him like a criminal: \u201cI followed all the rules and I asked for admission.\u201d\n\nTrump, however, is working to make the asylum process much more restrictive than what Rolando has experienced. His administration passed a policy in July banning migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they came from another country, saying they must first seek protections elsewhere.\n\nThe supreme court ruled last month that Trump\u2019s ban could go into effect while legal challenges continued.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump visits a section of the US-Mexico border wall in Otay Mesa on 18 September. Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\nRolando was released in September and is awaiting an asylum hearing scheduled for next week. He said he wanted to speak out because he was particularly upset about the treatment he saw other detainees face at Otay Mesa. Some were disabled and unable to walk to the cafeteria to get food, he said, noting that he got reprimanded when he tried to bring them food.\n\n\u201cThey abuse their power with us,\u201d he said.\n\nOtay Mesa has repeatedly faced accusations of severe medical neglect. Last week, a detainee died in custody.\n\nRolando said he wanted the government to understand that people seek asylum because they have no other option \u2013 and that officials should believe him: \u201cWhen you\u2019re asking for asylum, you\u2019re swearing to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
