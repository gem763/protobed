Photo: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House released a \u201ctranscript\u201d of a key July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 or more accurately, a memo summarizing the call. While Trump had claimed the transcript would show the call was \u201cperfect,\u201d it failed to pour cold water on the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2014 and, in fact, raised more questions. Here\u2019s a quick guide to help decipher the major questions about the document.\n\nIs this the full transcript?\n\nNo. It\u2019s a \u201cMemorandum of a Telephone Conversation\u201d according to the document itself. A footnote at the bottom of the first page explains:\n\nCAUTION: A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation. The word \u201cinaudible\u201d is used to indicate portions of a conversation that the notetaker was unable to hear.\n\nSome have suggested that a verbatim transcript of the call would be much longer, since the conversation lasted 30 minutes but is conveyed in just five pages.\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nAfter Zelensky told Trump that Ukraine would like to buy more Javelin missiles, the anti-tank weapons that it first acquired in 2018, Trump responded by saying, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though.\u201d Then he launched into a fairly inscrutable monologue mentioning CrowdStrike and former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nCrowdStrike is a U.S.-based cybersecurity firm that the Democratic National Committee hired to look into hacks on its servers. The firm determined that the attack originated from Russian government hackers. In his comments to Zelensky, Trump appeared to be referencing a conspiracy theory that accuses CrowdStrike of participating in a cover-up by helping the DNC hide that the hack was an inside job. According to CyberScoop, this is a common right-wing conspiracy and easy to debunk.\n\nWho\u2019s the prosecutor Trump\u2019s talking about?\n\nIn the call, Trump references Ukraine\u2019s \u201cvery good\u201d former prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. The former prosecutor general in Ukraine, Shokin is at the center of Trump\u2019s allegation that former Vice-President Joe Biden improperly used his power to help his son, Hunter Biden. As Trump tells it, Biden was pushing for Shokin to be fired at the same time that he was investigating a natural gas firm with the younger Biden on its board. There are plenty of problems with Trump\u2019s version of events \u2014 for starters, Shokin\u2019s investigation into the oil company had gone dormant at the time of his firing \u2014 but perhaps most problematic in his call with Zelensky is the way Trump describes the former prosecutor.\n\nTrump called Shokin \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201cvery fair,\u201d and asserted that he was treated badly. But that\u2019s not quite right. As CNN notes, Shokin\u2019s detractors were many, including \u201cthe Obama administration, American allies, the International Monetary Fund and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists.\u201d\n\nShokin was widely faulted for declining to bring prosecutions of elites\u2019 corruption, and he was even accused of hindering corruption investigations. His deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, resigned in February 2016, alleging that Shokin\u2019s office was itself corrupt.\n\nTo consider such a person \u201cvery fair,\u201d you\u2019d have be pretty corrupt yourself.\n\nWhat about the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine?\n\nOn page four of the White House memo, Zelensky brings up a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, whose name he recalls as Ivanovich. Zelensky may have had trouble recalling her name \u2014 it\u2019s actually Marie Yovanovitch \u2014 but he remembers that she wasn\u2019t his biggest fan. \u201cShe would not accept me as a new president well enough,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s going to go through some things,\u201d Trump responded. It\u2019s unclear what that means. In May of this year, Yovanovitch was recalled \u201cahead of her scheduled departure,\u201d according to the Washington Post. In the preceding months, she had become a target of the right-wing media, with Donald Trump Jr. calling her a \u201cjoker\u201d in a March tweet.", "description": "Deciphering Trump and Zelensky\u2019s references to CrowdStrike, the U.S. ambassador, and the \u201cvery good\u201d Ukrainian prosecutor in the memo on the call released by the White House.", "authors": ["Adam K.
