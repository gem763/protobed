It originally meant \u201creduce by one tenth\u201d but, because it sounds a bit like \u201cdestroy\u201d, it is widely used to mean \u201cdramatically reduce\u201d.\n\nThis is particularly awkward for some readers when we use it of a percentage reduction that is not 10 per cent. We said last week, for instance, \u201cYouth services \u2018decimated by 69 per cent\u2019 in less than a decade amid surge in knife crime, figures show\u201d.\n\nThanks to John Schluter for questioning the use of \u201cdecimated\u201d, but pretty much everything about this headline is terrible. The d-word is in quotation marks because it was used by an MP commenting on the figures, although she didn\u2019t mention the 69 per cent.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThen we had \u201cin less than a decade\u201d, which is vague. The story is that spending on youth services has been cut by 69 per cent since 2010. Nine years is an odd period, but there is nothing wrong with \u201csince 2010\u201d.\n\nThen we had \u201camid\u201d, the standard journalese device for implying cause and effect without saying so. The story reported that some MPs and the chief executive of the YMCA, which runs youth clubs, claim that the reduction in spending is linked to the rise in knife crime over a similar period. We could have said that in the headline.\n\nAnd finally we had \u201cfigures show\u201d, which was redundant. We meant that the 69 per cent figure had been produced by someone. It was the YMCA, as it turned out, so we could have said, \u201caccording to the YMCA\u201d, but that would have been a lot of capital letters for a headline and it might not have been immediately obvious to the reader what the YMCA is or why it is an authority on the subject.\n\nHowever, quotation marks can be a useful device, to indicate that the source of a claim is an organisation that has an interest in the matter.\n\nSo the headline could have said something like: \u201cMPs blame \u201869 per cent cut\u2019 in spending on youth services since 2010 for rise in knife crime\u201d.\n\nDebased coinage: We used the phrase gold standard three times last week. In a report about a study that found surgery for chronic shoulder pain doesn\u2019t work, we described randomised control trials as \u201cthe gold standard for clinical evidence\u201d.\n\nIn review of anti-allergy pillows we said the seal of approval from Allergy UK and the British Allergy Foundation was the \u201cgold-standard status\u201d. And in an article about the Brithdir Mawr commune in Wales, we said it \u201cmay set the gold standard\u201d for sustainable living.\n\nThe problem with the actual gold standard \u2013 the policy of making paper money convertible into gold \u2013 is that it was a disaster that intensified the misery of the Depression after the crash of 1929.\n\nStill, perhaps the use of the metaphor should be encouraged as a reminder of the frailty of humanity\u2019s attempts to fix permanent benchmarks for quality.", "description": "My campaign to abolish the word \u201cdecimate\u201d has not yet succeeded.
