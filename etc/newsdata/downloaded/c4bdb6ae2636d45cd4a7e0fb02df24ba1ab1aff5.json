Fresh data also showed that consumer spending slowed recently and businesses pulled back on investment, heightening worries about economic growth at a time when two of the biggest global economies remain embroiled in a trade conflict.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell about 1% before shedding some of these losses to close down 15.83 points, or 0.5%, to 2961.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 70.87 points, or 0.3%, to 26820.25, swinging almost 300 points from its high to low of the day. The Nasdaq Composite lost 91.03 points, or 1.1%, to 7939.63.\n\nAll three indexes declined at least 0.4% for the week.\n\nThe turn lower Friday came after Bloomberg News reported that Trump administration officials are considering ways to limit U.S. investors' portfolio flows into China. For some, the stock market reaction highlighted how sensitive investors are to developments on trade between the two countries.\n\n\"The market goes through these ebbs and flows depending on the headline of the day,\" said Amy Kong, managing director at Fiduciary Trust Co. International. \"It is going to be like this until they do come to some sort of firm agreement,\" she said of the trade talks.\n\nTrade isn't the only headwind for investors. The week was marked by some large intraday moves as investors navigated both political drama and fresh data on the economy. In addition to trade, investors have been parsing political news from Washington as House Democrats began an impeachment inquiry against President Trump this week. Several investors and analysts said that they didn't expect the inquiry to have a long-term impact on share prices.\n\nShares of tech companies were some of the hardest hit Friday, while financial stocks outperformed the broader market, continuing a trend from this month. One of the biggest decliners was Micron Technology, which tumbled $5.39, or 11%, to $43.21 after the company reported late Thursday a decline in sales and earnings in the latest quarter.\n\nWells Fargo shares climbed $1.84, or 3.8%, to $50.17 after the San Francisco bank appointed Charles Scharf as chief executive and president. Mr. Scharf is leaving Bank of New York Mellon to succeed C. Allen Parker, interim CEO since Timothy Sloan resigned in late March.\n\nShares of Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup edged moderately higher as well.\n\nInvestors continued to watch for signs of the health of the domestic economy, especially as concerns about wobbling growth world-wide have mounted.\n\nFresh data showed U.S. consumer spending slowed more than expected in August, a sign that a key part of the economy could be losing steam. Meanwhile, one proxy for business investment -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- declined in August, recording its weakest performance since April, the Commerce Department said. That data highlighted the toll that trade tensions with China could take on the domestic economy. Economists ramped down estimates of third-quarter economic growth after Friday's data.\n\n\"It's all about uncertainty,\" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives of Schwab Center for Financial Research, particularly surrounding trade. \"When you see a slowdown in spending...that does cause concern.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Fed leader Patrick Harker highlighted this in a speech Friday, saying that \"there are clear downside risks, mostly posed by trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed. It is that uncertainty, more than anything, that is affecting business decisions.\"\n\nHe also said the Fed should hold firm on rates right now and remained upbeat about the economy.\n\nThe unease has also rippled through the bond market as investors have turned to safer bets like Treasurys. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.678% Friday from 1.754% last week, capping off a second straight week of declines as bond prices have risen.\n\nDespite the recent turbulence, major indexes remain near record highs, though the stock market's leadership has shifted somewhat this month. Some investors have increased positions in shares of companies that appear undervalued while shedding some of the big momentum-driven stocks that have driven the market's gains.\n\nThat trend was on display Friday as energy and financials sectors in the S&P 500 outperformed the broader gauge. Financials stocks were the only gainers, while shares of energy companies were flat despite the broader market's losses.\n\nInvestors also dumped other risky assets like oil. Global oil benchmark Brent crude slipped 1.3% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia moved to impose a partial cease-fire in Yemen. Houthi forces in a surprise move last week declared a unilateral cease-fire in the country.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5% but suffered its biggest percentage decline since August. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 added 1% after a Bank of England official said an interest-rate cut could be needed even if a Brexit deal is reached.\n\nElsewhere, stocks closed broadly lower in Asia, with Tokyo's Nikkei down 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 0.3%. Shares in Shanghai were an outlier, edging up 0.1%.\n\nKaren Langley and and Carlo Martuscelli contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 16:54 ET (20:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
