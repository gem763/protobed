After all, it\u2019s Amazon \u2014 decades long dominator of e-commerce and the cloud.\n\n\u201cAmazon doesn\u2019t worry about anything that anybody else does, ever,\u201d said Jon Reily, e-commerce strategist at Publicis Sapient, on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. \u201cAmazon is its own animal, it doesn\u2019t look quarter to quarter or year to year \u2014 they do what they are going to do.\u201d\n\nBut strong second-quarter earnings results from two old-school retail rivals suggest Amazon better be watching its back.\n\nHoly grail of retail\n\nThe overall synopsis from Target\u2019s (TGT) and Walmart\u2019s (WMT) second quarters: Each is beginning to reach the holy grail in modern day retailing. That is by successfully offering a seamless shopping experience both online and in thousands of physical stores, each retailer is able to drive strong sales and profits.\n\nFor its part, Target reported Wednesday second quarter adjusted earnings of $1.82 a share, trouncing forecasts for $1.62 a share. Same-store sales rose 3.4%, ahead of estimates for 3% growth. The stock touched a record on the session.\n\nThe retailer cited a surge in same-day fulfillment as driving sales growth. Its order pick up, drive up and Shipt services accounted for nearly 1.5 percentage points of Target\u2019s overall comparable sales growth during the quarter. Online sales jumped 34% during the quarter.\n\nA tip of the hat also goes to hundreds of Target store remodels and vastly improved food departments. Both are helping to get people in the door more often \u2014 and perhaps shopping less on Amazon.\n\n\u201cSo we are seeing our Target guests visit us more frequently, shop more categories. They are enjoying the changes we have made in the store experience, but they are also taking advantage of the convenient fulfillment options that we are offering,\u201d Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts during a conference call.\n\nTarget also hiked its estimates for the third quarter, seeing adjusted earnings of between $1.04 per share to $1.24 per share, better than current expectations of $1.16.\n\nThe story was similar at Walmart in the quarter.\n\nA checkout scanner at a Walmart Supercenter in Houston.

Phillip) More\n\nWalmart\u2019s earnings beat analyst forecasts by 5 cents on the back of 2.8% same-store sales increase at U.S. stores. Online sales grew an impressive 37% at Walmart U.S. and 35% at Sam\u2019s Club.\n\nThe retailer slightly lifted its full-year same-store sales outlook.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re favorably positioned as we leverage our expansive supercenter network to deliver a robust omni-channel experience,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said. \u201cMore than ever, we\u2019re innovating across the business. We\u2019re experimenting with emerging technologies to improve store operations and reduce friction in our customers\u2019 lives. The initiatives we have underway provide extended access to our brand and position the company to earn a greater share of our customers\u2019 wallet over time.\u201d\n\nThe future of shopping\n\nThe pool of online shoppers is so plentiful that many retailers stand to prosper, provided they are doing well with online services and offering stuff people want, says Reily. Hard to argue with the size of the internet being a goldmine for well-run retailers for years to come.\n\nBut what we are witnessing at Target and Walmart are two well-capitalized companies with their best organizational talent in some time. That talent is moving very quickly \u2014 and mostly profitably \u2014 to get products and services to consumers faster than ever before. They are anticipating the future of shopping, instead of reacting to it like they have done for decades.\n\nIt\u2019s that slowness that allowed Amazon to take root in the United States, well that and the smartphone.\n\nNow it\u2019s time for Amazon to realize Target and Walmart are legitimate threats in large part because they have strategically placed stores and talent that wants to win. For Amazon, the evolving dynamic suggests it will need to get serious about opening brick-and-mortar stores, offering more services and cleaning up its horribly cluttered website.", "description": "Amazon still knows it's Amazon.
