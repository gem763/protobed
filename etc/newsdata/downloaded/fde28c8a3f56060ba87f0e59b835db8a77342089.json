She also asked sports fans whose teams wear red hats -- such as the Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Nationals -- not to don that specific color cap in public.\n\n\u201cNot worth making disenfranchised people feel unsafe,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe also railed against parody MAGA hats if they, too, are red.\n\n\u201cAlso, for the love of God: The clever folks wearing \"Make America Read Again\" or whatever caps -- NO. You're making everyone scared. Don't do it,\u201d she wrote.\n\nNEW JERSEY MAN CLAIMS HE WAS ATTACKED FOR WEARING 'MAGA' HAT, CLAIMS TEENS SHOUTED 'F--- TRUMP!'\n\nMakkai's initial tweet has received more than 19,600 likes and been retweeted more than 1,500 times. But several users posted screenshots showing the author had blocked them on Twitter after slamming the \u201cleftist\u201d novelist for being so easily \u201ctriggered\u201d by red hats.\n\nA few did agree with Makkai, and one asked fans of the Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Angels, Arizona Cardinals and others not to wear a team cap, asserting \u201cRed hats = bigotry.\u201d\n\nBut others thought Makkai's idea was way off base.\n\n\"It's a hat, and this is a Free Country, \u201c John Betts wrote. \"The very fact that you\u2019re triggered by the hat shows what a serious problem you have with tolerating opposing political views.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cIs anyone else made really uncomfortable by closed minded leftists?\u201d another user, Robert Boyette, asked. A third user wrote: \u201cMaybe find out everyone with a red hat, even ones with MAGA on them, aren't some sort of bogeyman and learn to adult better, like a normal person would.\u201d\n\nMakkei responded to her critics, saying she wasn't writing her tweets for them but for those who agree with her.\n\n\"Please note that I was specifically addressing \"normal people,\"\" she wrote.\n\nSome users claimed they were Trump fans who were being denied their First Amendment right to wear MAGA hats in public for fear they would be assaulted for expressing their political views.\n\nMakkai first stirred up controversy by writing on Aug. 31: \u201cIs anyone else made really uncomfortable these days by anyone wearing any kind of red baseball cap? Like, I see one and my heart does weird sh** and then I finally realize it only says Titleist or whatever. Maybe don't wear red caps anymore, normal people?\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to justify her plea for people to stop wearing red hats altogether, she noted that though the swastika -- a symbol in the ancient Sanskrit language -- stood for luck, purity and well-being in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, those who practice these faiths largely stopped using the symbol after it was adopted by Nazis.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re here to be contrary: an equivalent here would be western Hindus choosing not to use the swastika symbol in public despite it being sacred to their faith because it would offend/frighten people. The red hat has become a symbol of hate bc of how its wearers act,\u201d Makkai wrote.\n\n\"The red hat has become a symbol of hate bc of how its wearers act.\" \u2014 Rebecca Makkai, Chicago author\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe added Tuesday: \u201cAlso I love all the people who are like \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T POLICE ME, LIBTARD!\u201d Please note that I was specifically addressing \u201cnormal people.\u201d The ones who don\u2019t want to freak people out at a distance. The ones who enjoy it should absolutely continue letting us know who thy [sic] are.\u201d\n\nMakkai wrote \"The Great Believers,\" a novel that addresses the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 90s that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and received the ALA Carnegie Medal and the LA Times Book Prize, among other accolades, according to her website.", "description": "Has \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" literally gone to liberals' heads?
