I\u2019m very proud to stand and be the manager of that team,\u201d said Rodgers after a game played out in driving rain at St Mary\u2019s Stadium.\n\n\u201cA mark of the good sides is you don\u2019t let up. We wanted to show we\u2019re a good side and we certainly did that in the second half.\n\n\u201cWe were ruthlessly simple in our game. When you\u2019re so many goals up you can easily slow but we kept focused. We want to be a top team and to be a top team you must be clinical.\u201d\n\nHasenhuttl saw his team slip into the bottom three and he pulled no punches after a performance which also saw Ryan Bertrand red-carded after 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cThe performance was a disaster and I have to apologise and take 100 percent responsibility -\u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a team act like this, there was no fight for anything,\u201d admitted the Saints\u2019 coach.\n\nSouthampton midfielder Nathan Redmond added: \u201cIt was an embarrassing performance, the stuff of nightmares.\u201d\n\nLeicester are just five points behind league leaders Liverpool, who host Tottenham on Sunday, after recording the biggest-ever victory by an away side in an English top-flight match in the 131-year history of the Football League.\n\nBen Chilwell began the destruction in the 10th minute when he tapped in on the rebound, and Ryan Bertrand\u2019s red card \u2014 awarded via VAR for a late tackle on Perez in the build-up to the opener \u2014 helped the away side open the floodgates.\n\n\u2013 Raining goals \u2013\n\nQuickfire strikes from Youri Tielemans and Perez put Leicester three goals to the good with less than 20 minutes gone amid a downpour on the south coast.\n\nPerez struck again seven minutes before the break from a Chilwell cross to make it four before Vardy scored his first of the evening as Leicester racked up five goals in the first half of a league match for the first time since 1984.\n\nIt was also the first time that a side had crashed home that many goals in the opening period of a Premier League game since Manchester City beat Burnley 6-1 in April 2010.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Leicester from raining down goals on Southampton however, with two coming within a minute just before the hour mark.\n\nFirst Perez completed his treble after collecting Hervey Barnes\u2019 superb lofted through ball in the 57th minute, and Vardy headed home from another precise Chilwell cross seconds later.\n\nJames Maddison made it a record-breaking away scoreline with five minutes remaining when he swung home a perfect free-kick that zipped past the desperate Angus Gunn.\n\nAnd Vardy sealed Leicester\u2019s place in the record books with his ninth of the season deep into stoppage, firing home a penalty that also took him top of the Premier League scoring charts with nine goals after he was brought down by Jan Bednarek.", "description": "Southampton (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers hailed his team as \u201cruthless\u201d for their record-equalling 9-0 rout of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/101660_jamie-vardy-celebrates-his-team-ninth-goal-rodgers-hails-ruthless-leicester-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
