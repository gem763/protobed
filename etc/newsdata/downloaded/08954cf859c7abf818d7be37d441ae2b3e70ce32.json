We\u2019re all sticky-out-bottom people.\n\n\u2018And I\u2019ve been working out for decades, so the shape of mine is down to years of keeping fit.\n\n\u2018I walk seven miles a day and I try to do a 15-mile walk once a week as well, up the Brecon Beacons or along the River Cam. It makes me so happy.'", "description": "The Countdown star, 58, looked sensational as she enjoyed the Wales vs Uruguay match in Japan on Sunday.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/10/19650076-0-image-a-72_1570958036545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
