Erik Lamela profited with the rebound from his effort gleefully dispatched by Eriksen. Soon enough Emery will have to make a judgement on Luiz and whether the current destabilising effect he is having on an already vulnerable defence is worthwhile.\n\nKane does it again in north London derby\n\nHarry Kane's penalty to put Spurs 2-0 lifted him into a tie for top goalscorer in north London derby history.\n\nWith 10 goals, Kane, still only 26 years old, is level with Bobby Smith and Emmanuel Adebayor.\n\nHe'll have to wait to take the record for himself though, with the width of the post denying him a second in the game after driving across goal from the right side of the penalty area.\n\nLeno spotlight intensifies\n\nBernd Leno appears to have a glaring weakness in his game, which Spurs profited from once and should have done so again.\n\nThe German's inability to either hold shots from range, or judge how much power he should apply when parrying the ball, created needless danger.\n\nFirst to set up Christian Eriksen's opener after failing to hold the tamest of shots from Erik Lamela. Then Harry Kane's bobbling effort directed towards the near post, which was pushed into the direction of Son Heung-min, who failed to shoot immediately, therefore allowing Arsenal to eventually recover and crowd out the danger following the subsequent cutback.", "description": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang rescued a point for\u00a0Arsenal\u00a0to clinch a 2-2 draw against\u00a0Tottenham\u00a0in a pulsating\u00a0north London derby.\u00a0 Spurs ruthlessly took their chances in a first half with Christian Eriksen\u00a0and Harry Kane putting the visitors into a 2-0 lead.\u00a0 But Alexandre Lacazette gave the Gunners hope heading into the break, utilising his quick feet before rifling past Hugo", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/18/Arsenal-celebrate-their-equaliser-vs-Spurs.jpg"}
