(Nahlah Ayed/CBC)\n\nAfter more than 20 years of peace, many of the walls remain \u2014 along with old divisions. In the first episode of a five-part series on IDEAS called Walking the Border: The Walls That Divide Us, Ayed heads to Belfast to find out if the peace walls are helping or hindering community reconciliation.\n\nAmong the youth, who know nothing of the Troubles, there are many who want to break down the 'peace walls' and build a different future.\n\nIn Ayed's documentary, you'll meet Naomi Burns, Glenn Doherty, and Rebecca Coggles \u2014 students who have grown up in divided neighbourhoods in Belfast. They participate in programs run by Springboard Opportunities, a non-profit organization that focuses on creating peace and understanding between the different faith communities.\n\nThe organization helps Protestant and Catholic communities work to build bonds between them \u2014 as a united way forward.\n\nNaomi Burns, Glenn Doherty, and Rebecca Coggles, work with other students to build peace between Protestant and Catholic communities. (Nahlah Ayed/CBC)\n\nRadio for the mind\n\nThis fall, IDEAS takes a deep-dive into contemporary thought and intellectual history: the perils of denim, possibly the most polluting garment in the world; how menopause has been viewed throughout history; and the ongoing influence of Joseph Campbell's seminal book, Hero With a Thousand Faces; and, of course, the 2019 CBC Massey Lectures by Sally Armstrong.\n\nAs always, IDEAS will continue to feed the curious mind and inspire our listeners to think.
