Ole Gunnar Solskjaer almost lost his footing as he left the sodden St James Park pitch after yet another slip up by his team who now sit just two points outside the relegation places.\n\nTo put that further in perspective they are, after just eight games, a stunning and wholly unacceptable 15 points behind the Premier League leaders Liverpool who, after the international break, are their next opponents at Old Trafford.\n\nIt could not be more miserable. It could not be more bereft of ideas or dispiriting which was probably also the sense shared by the Newcastle fans as they poured into a dank, wet stadium in what has been a dismal campaign for them so far but left with songs resonating around this proud old hill-top cathedral.\n\nWhat a difference a game makes. What a difference a new local hero makes; especially to Newcastle who always crave such figures. They cheered raucously as Andy Carroll came on as a second-half substitute but it was a 19-year-old kid from North Shields making his Premier League debut, and doing so alongside his brother in the centre of midfield, who did it. Matty Longstaff struck the only goal, a crisp unerring low drive as he ran onto the ball that beat a static David De Gea and found the net. And that all came in a counter-attack from a United corner. Longstaff reeled away kissing the badge with the Newcastle fans singing \u201che\u2019s one of our own\u201d.\n\nHow a beleaguered Steve Bruce needed this after a 5-0 beating away to Leicester City as \u2013 at his 24th attempt \u2013 he finally defeated his former club as a manager and in doing so lifted Newcastle out of the bottom three, at Everton\u2019s expense, and only a point behind United.", "description": "Manchester United succumbed in front of the Gallowgate End but while this was another public execution it is becoming a slow painful death for them.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Charles Richardson", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Live Updates", "Luke Edwards", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212226662-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7PVyrEkZLfZX-l1bJVAr838.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
