'How can he be fighting an eliminator again so soon after I beat him and he dropped to eighth (actually seventh) in the world rankings?' The answer is that the IBF are giving Galahad a second chance because of the controversy which surrounded the verdict at the end of their first meeting. That fight was more of a wrestling match but most observers - with the exception of two of the three judges - believed Warrington had lost a title hard-won against Lee Selby and brilliantly defended against Carl Frampton.\n\n'I suppose he's complained,' says Warrington. 'But as far as I'm concerned I've cleared out the domestic scene.' But he knows he has mostly himself to blame, admitting that the summer fight with Galahad was a 'disappointing cuddling contest' and that 'although I didn't overlook him there were some things I didn't take into consideration in my training.' We all live and learn. Warrington insists he has left nothing to chance this time, even though Takoucht is not well known outside France despite being ranked No 4 in the world.\n\nNor ought he, since nothing less than a performance of significantly higher voltage in the First Direct Arena can light up the path to big-name, title unification fights which he craves.\n\n'After this,' he says, 'all I want is meaningful fights against the other star names in the division.' Promoter Frank Warren is pleased that the man he describes as 'the best featherweight on the planet' wants to 'make a statement' against Takoucht.\n\nWarren says: 'Josh can go on to become one of the best fighters of his generation, which is probably why the other title holders Leo Santa Cruz and Oscar Valdez don't want to fight him. To help make that happen he needs to get past Takoucht in style.' Warrington says: 'Don't worry. I'm looking to knock him out early.' *Warrington v Takoucht will be televised live this Saturday night on BT Sport.", "description": "Josh Warrington is angrier with the Brit he beat in his last fight than with the Frenchman against whom he defends his world featherweight title in Leeds this Saturday night.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608502-0-image-a-23_1570828829561.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
