She had been on the swings when she suddenly disappeared.\n\nShe has been missing since that day on Sept. 16.\n\nAuthorities have conducted multiple searches, scoured the area where Dulce was last seen and processed thousands of tips.\n\nYet few answers or clues have developed.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\n\"We have not given up and remain hopeful that we will determine the circumstances that led to Dulce\u2019s disappearance,\" Cumberland County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae said in a statement on Wednesday, marking the one-month anniversary of her disappearance.\n\nAuthorities still have no strong suspects, but on Tuesday a sketch was released of a man they believe is a \"possible witness.\"\n\nThe prosecutor's office said the man in the sketch is someone who they want to speak with, but noted they are not identifying him as a suspect or person of interest.\n\nHe was allegedly at the park around the time Dulce went missing in the afternoon near City Park in Bridgeton. A witness recently came forward with his description and told authorities that he was seen with one or two children under the age of 5 years old.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if one of the children was Dulce, and Webb-McRae told ABC News she could not comment on specifics in the investigation.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nDulce's family has pleaded for anyone with information on her or her disappearance to come forward.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just an innocent girl. She\u2019s just 5 years old. She doesn\u2019t know nothing of the world that we know,\u201d Noema Alavez Perez, Dulce's mom, said at a Sept. 30 press conference.\n\nWebb-McRae has said that she is working with the hope that Dulce is alive.\n\nAnyone with information on the man or the case is asked to contact Bridgeton Police Department at 856-451-0033 or anonymously text information to TIP411 with the word \"Bridgeton.\"", "description": "Dulce Maria Alavez has been missing for a month.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/dulce-ht-er-190918_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
