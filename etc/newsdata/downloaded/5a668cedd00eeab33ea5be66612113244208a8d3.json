(Rendering courtesy of PGN Architects)\n\nConstruction of an apartment building for low-income people is underway in Northeast Washington\u2019s Deanwood neighborhood.\n\nThe Strand Residences at 5109 Nannie Helen Burroughs Ave. NE in Deanwood will consist of 86 affordable apartments. The project is being developed by the NHP Foundation, the Warrenton Group and the Washington Metropolitan CDC.\n\n[Three-bedroom, two-bathroom end-unit townhouse in D.C.'s Deanwood lists for $375,000]\n\nThe building, which is expected to be ready for residents in January 2021, will have 71 one-bedroom apartments and 15 two-bedroom apartments. Among the mix of units, 28 will be designated for residents who earn less than 30 percent of area median income and who are relocating from the nearby Lincoln Heights and Richardson Dwellings properties, which are scheduled to be torn down. Area median income is $121,300 for a four-person household, so the 30 percent income cap for a household of that size is $36,400. Income limits vary by household size.\n\nThe apartments are adjacent to the Strand Theater, a local historic landmark anticipated to be converted to a restaurant in 2020.\n\nPlanned amenities in the apartment building include a multipurpose room, an exercise room, bike storage, a patio for grilling and on-site resident services provided by NHP Foundation\u2019s affiliate organization, Operation Pathways.\n\nThe first floor of the building has retail space designated for a neighborhood nonprofit and a community-based business.\n\nFor updates, click here.", "description": "TOWN SQUARE | The Strand Residences at 5109 Nannie Helen Burroughs Ave. NE in D.C.'s Deanwood will include 86 apartments for low-income people.", "authors": ["Michele Lerner", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LkAsB1yg4ZNda6htKtZgIPTZiPg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JC6GM34RGZEGFJYDK5QQHSSVAQ.jpg"}
