What hapens to fruit in your shops to make them not began, please? Are they coated in beeswax?\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe school governor's hunch that the reason might be because they were coated in beeswax turned out to be correct.\n\nWhen Emma posted her findings to the Veganuary Facebook page social media users echoed her surprise.\n\n\"It's quite important we know this and perhaps get them to make a change,\" one wrote.\n\nAnother added: \"Would never have occurred to me to ask about fruit before I bought it.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAnother controversial fruit in the vegan world is the fig.\n\nUnusually, figs are pollinated by wasps which enter the plant's flower and then get trapped.\n\nThe wasp wanders around, pollinating the flower as it does but also wearing itself down through exhaustion.\n\nEventually it dies and is broken down by protein-digesting enzymes.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nJess Mann, a 22-year-old vegan, told Vegan Life magazine : \u201cYou are not guaranteed to be eating these insects when you\u2019re eating other veggies or fruits, but you are with figs, so it seems like an easy and practicable step to take to avoid them.\n\n\"I personally have a revulsion to eating meat because I find it disgusting. Just look at the \u2018controlled rotting process\u2019 hung beef goes through \u2013 it\u2019s gross.\n\n\"I feel the same about eating a decomposed wasp\u2019s body. It\u2019s just horrible to think about a living creature decomposing \u2013 and then eating it.\"", "description": "Emma Boylan from Watford was surprised to find that plant products sold at Costa Coffee are not vegan", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images", "Internet Unknown"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565760.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Fresh-mandarin-oranges-texture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
