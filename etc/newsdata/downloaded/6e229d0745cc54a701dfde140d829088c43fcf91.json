On Friday President Trump announced a \u201cPhase 1 Deal\u201d with China and stocks extended their gains. However bulls were not impressed. USD/JPY failed to extend higher because the \u201csubstantial deal,\u201d has \u201cnot been put in writing\u201d according to Trump and it may take up to 5 weeks to get the deal written. We know that China agreed to purchase $40-$50B in agricultural goods but there\u2019s nothing about intellectual property, which means that in a nutshell, there\u2019s not much meat to this agreement.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 October 15 tariffs delayed, no mention of Dec.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Phase 1 deal still needs to be written, takes 5 weeks\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 China agrees to $40-50B more AG purchases\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Agreement on FX Transparency\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Trump says deal could still fall apart\n\nWhat a Phase 1 deal means is that Trump gets validation from the markets and China gets their October tariffs delayed. The next 5 weeks is really critical because this is the fourth time that the US has offered relief to China and trade relations soured quickly after. There are also questions about whether the tariffs in December will be pushed off as well. China has extended an invitation to US officials for further talks next month. As the negotiations continue, investors will be watching the headlines closely to see if the trade truce stays but for the time being, the phase 1 deal eliminates near-term risks for China.\n\nMeanwhile the UK is closer than ever to a Brexit deal and the nearly 2% rally in reflects the market\u2019s optimism that an agreement can be reached by October 31. Minimally the EU may have an idea on the table different enough to allow negotiations to proceed. On an intraday basis, the pound saw its strongest 1-day move in more than a decade following positive language out of Brussels. The two darkest clouds this year have been trade and Brexit and while Brexit negotiators are still working on areas of agreement, this is the closest they\u2019ve come to amenable terms since Theresa May was Prime Minister. The EU\u2019s Michel Barnier described his talk with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay as \u201cconstructive\u201d because Britain has accepted that any solution to replace the backstop cannot involve a customs border on the island of Ireland. However one viable option would be to do the customs checks in the Irish Sea. We are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and the rally in sterling reflects the possibility of a breakthrough in the weeks ahead. The EU wants to avoid a no-deal Brexit and with less than 3 weeks to go, the intense negotiations in the days ahead could finally break the gridlock. There are many pieces of market moving UK data on next week\u2019s calendar including , and the but nothing will impact sterling more than Brexit headlines. A deal is close and we look for GBP/USD to trade above 1.28.\n\nRisk appetite also helped climb to its strongest level in 3 weeks. Short covering has been the primary catalyst for the currency\u2019s move above 1.10. The of the last ECB meeting revealed how far apart EZ policymakers are on stimulus. Some members wanted a deeper cut while others didn\u2019t feel that lower rates were needed. This division raises the bar for further easing and suggests that not everyone in the ECB believes that the region\u2019s outlook is grim. The German is scheduled for release next week along with EZ and but we are more interested in the comments from the long list of ECB officials set to speak. Technically, 1.1050 is an important level for EUR/USD. If it breaks it in a meaningful way, the next stop should be 1.1160.\n\nAll three of the commodity currencies traded higher last week and the best performer was the . Although clocked in as the strongest currency, Canada earns the title of the strongest economy. Friday\u2019s were exceptionally robust with more than 53K jobs created in September, a figure that was seven times better than expected. Full-time jobs increased 70K, the strongest in 5 months and the second-best reading this year. The also dropped to 5.5% from 5.7%. Unlike many other central banks, Canada did not lower interest rates this year and they have no need to after Friday\u2019s report. USD/CAD fell sharply on the back of the release and further losses are likely but the loonie\u2019s biggest gains should be against other currencies like , , , and . There\u2019s a very good chance that next week\u2019s CPI reports will reinforce the positive outlook for the currency.\n\nInflation numbers are also scheduled for release from New Zealand while traders look forward to the and latest . Unlike Canada, the labor market in Australia is weakening but having lowered rates three times this year, we don\u2019t see another cut by the RBA in 2019, so the impact on AUD could be limited. The data could also surprise to the upside as the manufacturing and construction sectors report stronger labor-market conditions.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD.
