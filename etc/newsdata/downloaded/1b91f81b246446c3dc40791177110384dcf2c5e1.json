Biden Jr.\n\nIn the ensuing weeks, Mr. Perry has been drawn deeper into the questions around the pressure campaign on Mr. Zelensky, which has spurred an impeachment inquiry that threatens to engulf Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Rick-Perry-Energy-Secretary-Resigns.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
