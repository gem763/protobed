He\u2019s been saddled with mediocre cars that not even his raw talent could salvage, and a fantastic 2017 was more a blip than a sign Larson would blossom into a perennial championship contender.\n\nBut as Larson stood atop his Chevy with a two-year winless streak behind him, perhaps his playoff victory Sunday at Dover International Speedway was indeed a preview of a championship celebration ahead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a shock, either,\u201d Larson said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been running really well this year.\u201d\n\nLarson\u2019s wife, Katelyn, shot-gunned a beer in a sudsy victory lane bash as he flashed a No. 1 sign behind her, a worthy way to end a 75-race winless streak.\n\nThe 27-year-old Larson has been oh-so close toward grabbing the checkered flag since his last win Sept. 9, 2017, in Richmond. Larson had nine runner-up finishes in the No. 42 Chevrolet over that span and won the $1 million NASCAR All-Star race this season.\n\nHe cashed in at Dover with the Monster Mile-stone win (it was the track\u2019s 100th race) that earned him an automatic berth into the third round. Not only has Larson failed to win a title, long-time team owner Chip Ganassi has never won a NASCAR Cup Series championship, something that\u2019s surely chapped an organization with handfuls of IndyCar titles.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to get him that championship that, honestly, he\u2019s probably owed,\u201d Larson said.\n\nLarson had four of his six career Cup wins in 2017 and Dover marked his first one in the playoffs. He led 154 laps late after Denny Hamlin faded from a dominant early run (he led 219 laps) in the No. 11 Toyota that opened the door for Larson. Playoff drivers took the top six spots: Martin Truex Jr. was second, followed by Alex Bowman, Kevin Harvick, Hamlin and Kyle Busch. Chase Elliott and reigning series champion Joey Logano both suffered serious blows to their championship runs with a rough start to the second round.\n\nTruex won the spring race at Dover and didn\u2019t have enough down the stretch to catch Larson and complete the season sweep.\n\n\u201cWe just ran out of time,\u201d Truex said.\n\nLarson felt like a win or two was within reach on the strength of a sensational late-summer run of top-10 finishes. Larson escaped the first round without any serious drama and can now head to treacherous Talladega and then Kansas to end the second round without any serious concerns. He\u2019s the first driver of the 12 contenders in the field of eight.\n\n\u201cEverybody in this playoff field is going to be stressing next week at Talladega except for me, so that\u2019s good,\u201d Larson said. \u201cLast time I was at Talladega I was on my lid. I could still end up on my lid next week, but it\u2019s not going to matter after this win.\n\nLarson was expected to help bridge the gap between grassroots racing and NASCAR when Ganassi hired him before the 2012 season. Larson made his name by racing all over the country in any series where he could find a ride. Larson counted 92 races in 2011 and 123 races in 2012 and continued to race in the dirt even when he landed his ride with Ganassi. Larson had talked of wanting to pattern his career after someone like Tony Stewart, who started his career on dirt tracks in open wheel cars. Stewart in turn guaranteed Larson, who is half Japanese, would be the next big thing in NASCAR.\n\n\u201cIf not, you can take everything I own, because I\u2019m that confident,\u201d Stewart said years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s when.\u201d\n\nLarson\u2019s not there yet \u2014 but just maybe he\u2019s getting there.\n\nHere\u2019s what else happened at Dover.\n\nRACE RUINED\n\nLogano and Elliott both had their races ruined before the race even finished 10 laps. Logano failed to start the race because of a broken axle on the No. 22 Ford. He eventually hit the track more than 20 laps down and finished 34th.\n\n\u201cWe just used our mulligan up,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a must-win but we must do really well in the next two races.\u201d\n\nElliott, who won last week at Charlotte, had the engine in his No. 9 Chevrolet blow up just laps into the race and he finished last.\n\nElliott won Dover last season and can\u2019t afford another major slip-up to make the third round.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll stack up,\u201d he said. \u201cI assume we\u2019ll have to win one of these next few weeks. If you ever make it to Homestead, you\u2019re going to have to win down there.\u201d\n\nClint Bowyer and Ryan Blaney join Logano and Elliott as the bottom four drivers in the playoff field.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNASCAR heads to Talladega Superspeedway where Aric Almirola is the defending race winner.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As Larson stood atop his Chevy with a two-year winless streak behind him, perhaps his playoff victory Sunday at Dover International Speedway was indeed a preview of a championship celebration ahead.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/NASCAR_Dover_Auto_Racing_90846.jpg-d5d79_c0-0-3226-1880_s1770x1032.jpg?fea6e477acdc3504cc8fb6b8132a8364cacb245a", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
