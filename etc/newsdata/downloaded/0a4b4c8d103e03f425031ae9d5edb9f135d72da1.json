I don\u2019t think there was any real legs in the Manchester United story.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWhether there was interest, I\u2019ve never really asked the question.\n\n\u201cDistracted? You are a young lad, so you are going to be.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to learn to put that aside and just get on with the job in hand, which is playing for us.\n\n\u201cI do believe he signed a new contract last Christmas. There is no problem there contract-wise.\n\n\u201cThe thing for him now is to forget about contracts, forget his knee injury, forget Man Utd \u2013 it\u2019s all about getting back to playing like we know he is capable.\u201d\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nBruce, who spoke to his old boss Sir Alex Ferguson on Monday night, says he has plenty of support among the Newcastle hierarchy, despite his side\u2019s bad start to the season.\n\nBruce said: \u201cI think that is the key, the relationship anyone has with the people who employ you.\n\n\u201cOf course, I am not naive enough to think we can put in more performances like what we witnessed last weekend.\n\n\u201cBut the club has been in a relegation battle for a long time, hasn\u2019t it? That\u2019s where we find ourselves.\n\n\u201cSir Alex is always terrific. If there is ever a time you need a bit of advice, he is always there to help you.\n\n\u201cBut the thing in management that you can\u2019t do is try and copy somebody, because if you copy somebody you get unstuck.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United were keen on signing the Newcastle midfielder this summer but failed to make a formal offer", "authors": ["Simon Bird", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20383832.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Leicester-City-v-Newcastle-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
