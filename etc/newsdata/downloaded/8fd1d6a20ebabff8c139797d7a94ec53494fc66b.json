In 25 games in the 2018-19 season, he averaged 9.2 points in 21.2 minutes per game, shooting 48% from three-point range.", "description": "The Lakers point guard implied that the timing of the \"random\" test might not be a coincidence and that the viral photos may have fooled the league.", "authors": ["Alexandra Licata"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7264c12e22af057f2f799a-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
