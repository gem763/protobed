The right wing prepared the coup with international support.\u201d\n\nMorales went into elections needing 40% of votes and a 10-point margin of victory to avoid a second-round runner against the main opposition candidate, Carlos Mesa. By Wednesday afternoon 97% of the official results had been processed, giving him 46.49% and a 9.5-point lead.\n\nWith most outstanding votes from remote rural areas expected to go in his favour, Morales repeated his declaration of a first-round victory, which he had made prematurely on Sunday night.\n\nBut on Wednesday the Organization of American States (OAS) said that a runoff should be held even if Morales breached the 10-point margin.\n\n\u201cIn the case that \u2026 the margin of difference exceeds 10%, it is statistically reasonable to conclude that it will be by negligible margin,\u201d said Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez, the head of the OAS election observation team in Bolivia. \u201cGiven the context and the problematic issues in this electoral process the best option continues to be the convening of a second round.\u201d\n\nInternational observers have expressed concern over an unexplained daylong gap in the reporting of results which was followed by a surge in Morales votes when the count resumed on Monday.\n\n\u201cWhy did the government shut down the reporting of results?\u201d asked Carlos Trujillo, US ambassador to the OAS, at a special session convened to discuss the Bolivian situation. \u201cThe government allowed a somewhat fair election because they did not realise their own popularity and thought they could win under their system. When they realised they could not win in the first round they shut down the results so that they could steal the election.\u201d\n\nThe vice-president of Bolivia\u2019s electoral board resigned on Tuesday, saying that the decision of the board\u2019s six-member panel to suspend reporting results had discredited \u201cthe entire electoral process, causing unnecessary social convulsion\u201d.\n\nMesa has accused Morales of trying to conduct \u201ca giant fraud\u201d and vowed that his party \u201cwill not recognize a fraudulent result\u201d.\n\nIn a video statement on Wednesday, Mesa called for \u201cpermanent protests\u201d until a second-round vote was confirmed, and said he would present evidence of electoral fraud.\n\nAllegations of electoral fraud have already sparked street violence, in which anti-government protesters clashed with police, and set fire to electoral offices in eight of Bolivia\u2019s regional capital cities.\n\n\u2018Democracy in Bolivia has two faces\u2019: ambivalence as Evo Morales seeks fourth term Read more\n\nOn Tuesday the OAS said it would conduct an analysis of the election, focusing on the results reporting systems and the chain of custody of ballot boxes. However, the results of such an analysis are unlikely to please either side as the positions become increasingly entrenched.\n\nCivil society groups in eight of the country\u2019s nine departments called for a general strike that could bring the country to a standstill. \u201cNot even an ant will move in Santa Cruz,\u201d declared Luis Fernando Camacho, the leader of the civil society group for Santa Cruz, the country\u2019s largest and richest city.\n\nMorales has overseen relative stability and growth, but angered many by running for a fourth consecutive term despite a 2016 referendum which ruled against lifting term limits.\n\nThe results reflect the split between Bolivia\u2019s urban population \u2013 which broadly backed the opposition \u2013 and the rural Andean populations that remain loyal to Morales, a former coca farmer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Evo will accept the OAS\u2019s calls for a second round,\u201d says Jorge Derpic, a Bolivia specialist and assistant professor at the University of Georgia. \u201cThis is the first time we have seen protests by the middle classes in all the country\u2019s major cities against Morales. Evo has called to mobilize his base \u2013 the coca growers, the miners and the campesinos [the rural poor] \u2013 and we could see further partisan violent clashes between rural and urban areas.\u201d", "description": "President said in a televised speech the right \u2018prepared the coup\u2019 with foreign powers amid growing tensions over the election", "authors": ["Mat Youkee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d41bf45156470c1683cff435de89cf60cc85aee4/0_297_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=955bc05006515eef6307b60a426bae95", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
