He also agreed to a permanent ceasefire upon completion of the YPG withdrawal.\n\nSince then the ceasefire has largely held, despite what US officials have described as \"some minor skirmishes\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Erdogan told reporters in Ankara that the withdrawal of YPG fighters from the border area was \"continuing\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Aleem Maqbool hears from a grieving mother, a frustrated fighter and fleeing families\n\n\"According to the information I have received from my defence minister, we are talking about 700 to 800 already withdrawn and the rest, around 1,200 to 1,300, are continuing to withdraw. It has been said that they will withdraw,\" he said.\n\nMr Erdogan then warned that all the YPG fighters would have to \"get out\" by Tuesday night or the Turkish offensive would resume.\n\n\"If the promises given to us by America are not kept, we will continue our operation from where it left off, this time with a much bigger determination.\"\n\nThe president added that the YPG \"does not have a place in the future of Syria\" and that he would seek to end its presence in areas of Syria controlled by the Syrian government, which Turkey opposes.\n\nThe Turkish president has said he wants the \"safe zone\" to cover all 440km of the Turkey-Syria border currently controlled by a militia alliance led by the YPG, called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nBut a Turkish security source told Reuters news agency the YPG was expected to withdraw initially from a 120km strip from Ras al-Ain to Tal Abyad.\n\nTurkish-led forces have seized control of both towns and large parts of the sparsely populated, mostly Arab area between them.\n\nThe source said Mr Erdogan would discuss the YPG's withdrawal from the rest of the border during talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi on Tuesday.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan back opposing sides in Syria's civil war\n\nRussian forces have been taking up many of the positions abandoned by YPG fighters and US troops near the border as part of an agreement Moscow brokered between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, its ally, and the local Kurdish-led administration, which wanted help to halt the Turkish advance.\n\nThe Russian deployment has created the potential for clashes between Russia and Turkey - something Mr Erdogan and Mr Putin want to avoid.\n\n\"Russia wants to discuss the situation in the north-east of Syria, better understand what is going on,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov before the Sochi meeting. \"We want to acquire information about Turkey's plans and see how it compares with the general plan of the political settlement.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Russian military helicopters landed at the Tabqa airbase after US troops left, Russian defence ministry-controlled Zvezda TV reported.", "description": "President Erdogan says Kurdish fighters must withdraw before a ceasefire expires on Tuesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/21AE/production/_109322680_mediaitem109322677.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
