He stressed that China is \u201cwilling to work in concert with the U.S. to address each other\u2019s core concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect.\u201d\n\nLast week, the world\u2019s two largest economies reached a limited deal toward ending the 15-month trade war that\u2019s hampered global growth.\n\nAs part of the deal -- which Trump and President Xi Jinping could sign as soon as next month -- China agreed to raise its agricultural purchases to between $40 billion and $50 billion from $8 billion to $16 billion and to make certain reforms on intellectual property and financial services. The U.S. will not raise tariffs on Oct. 15 from 25 percent to 30 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether Trump plans to halt another round of tariffs that are set to take effect on Dec. 15.\n\nPhase two negotiations are expected to begin immediately after the first agreement is signed.\n\n\u201cStopping the escalation of the trade war benefits China, the U.S and the whole world. It\u2019s what producers and consumers alike are hoping for,\u201d Liu said in a rare public speech about the trade war.\n\nIn the third quarter, China\u2019s growth sputtered to a 26-year low, dragged down by weak factory production and investment sentiment.\n\nBut Liu dismissed any effects the trade war has had on China\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not worried about short-term economic volatility. We have every confidence in our ability to meet macroeconomic targets for the year,\u201d he said.", "description": "Last week, the world\u2019s two largest economies reached a limited deal toward ending the 15-month trade war that\u2019s hampered global growth.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/AP19283509574152-e1570970083893.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
