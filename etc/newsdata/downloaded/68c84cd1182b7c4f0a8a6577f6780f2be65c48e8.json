According to Melin, Booking.com knew about this but didn\u2019t do anything about it, Le Parisien reports.\n\nMelin said they felt \u201ccompletely humiliated.\u201d\n\nIn a screengrab shared by Melin on Twitter of the villa\u2019s listing, it was advertised as being five-star with a pool, hot tub, pergola, terrace, and outdoor kitchen.\n\nThe group immediately tried to call the supposed owner using the contact number provided, Le Parisien reports, but no one picked up.\n\nAccording to Melin, the \u201cowner\u201d had previously been responding to their messages, but shortly after their payment had gone through, about a week before the group\u2019s arrival, they had fallen silent.\n\nThe group tried contacting Booking.com next, speaking to various people but not getting anywhere for over five hours, Melin claims.\n\n\u00c0 la porte d\u2019un terrain vague quand on est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adresse donn\u00e9 par @bookingcom suite \u00e0 5h d\u2019appel avec le service client de @bookingcom aucune aide ni geste commercial. pic.twitter.com/WpLCw7Hg8Y \u2014 Julie (@JulieFelice_) August 19, 2019\n\nMelin says someone from the company even told them it wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s fault if they slept outside.\n\nThey were ultimately offered a reimbursement for the money within 10 working days, according to their tweets.\n\nAfter contacting customer service and getting hung up a first time, the only offer is a refund within 10 business days, or booking another villa at our expense. So we find ourselves in Split without housing and without solution! \u2014 Julie (@JulieFelice_) August 18, 2019\n\nHowever, Melin believes they may never have received this response had she and her friend Julie not documented the whole experience on Twitter, which duly went viral.\n\n\u201cVilla Felipa\u201d has now been removed from the property rental platform, and Booking.com has apologized.\n\n\u201cBecause we live for our customers and are super invested in helping to connect them with incredible travel experiences, in the very rare instance that something goes unexpectedly wrong at an accommodation, our dedicated customer service team is on hand 24/7 to support in every way we can,\u201d a spokesperson for Booking.com told Insider.\n\n\u201cWe are very sorry for the difficulties that this group encountered. As this is not the experience we want for any of our customers, we have provided a full refund for their original reservation, are covering all relocation expenses and have offered an additional amount as a gesture of goodwill.\u201d\n\nThe company added: \u201cThis property has also been removed from our site. We successfully facilitate hundreds of thousands of bookings every day that result in great stay experiences for our customers all over the world and we are committed to that mission.\u201d\n\nRead more: A group on a bachelorette-party trip were shocked to find a dead body in their Airbnb\n\nAfter spending Sunday night in a hotel, the group of friends said they found another villa to rent, but that this all added to the cost of the trip.\n\non fait la manche pic.twitter.com/KnC6dCq0GB \u2014 chloe (@mlnchlo) August 19, 2019\n\nDespite Booking.com\u2019s offer of a refund and financial assistance, Melin told Le Parisien: \u201cTwo of our friends had to return to France urgently because they weren\u2019t financially able to stay.\u201d\n\nFortunately, however, Melin says the new villa owners have been accommodating with regard to payment methods.\n\nThe now 10-strong group is unsure whether they\u2019ll be able to stay in Croatia until August 31 as planned due to the financial constraints.\n\n\u201cWe all arrived with a budget to cover going out, shopping, and restaurants, but not for a new villa,\u201d Melin said, adding that they deliberately chose to go to Hvar for the nightlife, which she said they now can\u2019t afford to experience.\n\nThey\u2019re staying optimistic, though.\n\n\u201cWe get on well,\u201d Melin said, telling Le Parisien that they plan to enjoy their remaining days trying not to think about everything that\u2019s happened.\n\nInsider has contacted Chloe Melin and Julie for further comment.", "description": "Business Insider - Two members of the group of 12 friends reportedly had to fly home to France as they couldn't afford to book more accommodation..
