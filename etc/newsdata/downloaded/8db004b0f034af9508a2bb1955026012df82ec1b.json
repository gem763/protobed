Imagine, for example, if South Africa\u2019s Siya Kolisi were to become the first black captain to hold aloft the Webb Ellis Cup. The last time the Springboks conquered the world in 2007, Kolisi was a wide-eyed 16-year-old watching in a township tavern.\n\nIt would be a momentous moment, too, if Tendai \u201cthe Beast\u201d Mtawarira were to leave Japan with a winners\u2019 medal. Now 34, the loosehead prop is one of the game\u2019s most popular figures, so much so a cry of \u201cBeee-eeast!\u201d echoes around the stadium when he carries the ball. Given his father told him he would never make it as a rugby player when he left his native Zimbabwe for Durban at the age of 18, his story serves as another inspiration to all.\n\nEngland back Ben Spencer not to buckle in World Cup final baptism of fire Read more\n\nWhen the Boks won their first World Cup in 1995, Mtawarira was living in Harare. At primary school he played soccer \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t watch rugby then\u201d \u2013 but in his teens he began to become aware of rugby and prominent Springbok forwards such as Gary Teichmann and Bobby Skinstad. Something inside him stirred. \u201cAll I thought about was being a Springbok. It was all I dreamed of. My dad thought I was making the wrong move. He told me that if I went down to South Africa I would be facing giants who were probably going to crush me. He didn\u2019t really believe in my ability, so I saw it as a challenge. I told myself: \u2018I\u2019m going to prove you wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow the durable front-row is the third most-capped Springbok with 116 caps, behind only Victor Matfield and Bryan Habana. To win a World Cup in the twilight of his Test career would reward his dedication and his perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds. \u201cIn 2007 I did watch and it was amazing, inspirational stuff. To be part of a World Cup final is a dream come true. I have worked hard throughout my career to get here and I want to make it count.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tendai Mtawarira (centre) celebrates with Mbongeni Mbonambi (left) and Siya Kolisi after beating Wales in the World Cup semi-finals.

His many years of experience taught him what to expect whenever he encounters a white jersey with a red rose on it. \u201cEvery time we play against each other it\u2019s always a physical onslaught. I don\u2019t think it will be any different on Saturday. There\u2019s definitely a mutual respect between the two countries. The best way we can show that is by going hard against each other.\u201d\n\nHe also confirms the Springbok forwards have been forewarned by England\u2019s semi-final display against New Zealand. \u201cThey got on the front foot, were more physical and they got their reward. We are going to have to play out of our skins to win. They outplayed a really good team and we\u2019re going to have to be very physical. It\u2019ll be all about who takes charge of those big moments.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa have lost only one Test this year \u2013 against the All Blacks in the pool stages \u2013 and their pack are as big and settled as any in the tournament. Despite having one day less to prepare, Mtawarira does not believe a shortage of energy will be a problem for the winners of this year\u2019s Rugby Championship.\n\nEngland's Eddie Jones hits back at Gatland: 'Enjoy the third-place play-off' Read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big deal. The positive thing is that we have no injuries and we\u2019ve had a good buildup to this final. Right now we have some good momentum. What happened in the past doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\n\nThey also have a nation willing them to replicate their triumphs of 1995 and 2007. \u201cIt means a lot to unite the country. There is a lot of excitement back home, lots of fans rallying behind the team and that is inspiring for us. We just want to go out there and represent our country the best we can.\u201d\n\nAnd if Kolisi does end up lifting the trophy, Mtawarira is among those who believes it would rank among the great rugby images. \u201cIt would be extra special. Siya is an inspirational leader \u2026 he has been exemplary. It would be amazing to win this World Cup with him as captain.\u201d\n\nEngland may be favourites to lift the trophy but, in addition to Kolisi, they still have to tame the Beast.", "description": "Tendai Mtawarira\u2019s path to the World Cup final has been hard and he aims to make it worthwhile in Saturday\u2019s \u2018physical onslaught\u2019", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3a7093ab038a538ed91552d5301b0356e3b720/229_120_4072_2443/master/4072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2bca8b482ca504500a0011c00b4771f8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
