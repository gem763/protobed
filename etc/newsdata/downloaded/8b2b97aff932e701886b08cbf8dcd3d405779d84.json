Francisco Seco/Pool via REUTERS\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would be withdrawing it\u2019s troops from northeastern Syria, clearing the way for Turkish troops to launch an offensive against Kurdish fighters in the area.\n\nSince then, Trump has said he will keep a small number of troops in parts of northeastern Syria where there is oil. Russian military police started deploying on Syria\u2019s border with Turkey on Wednesday under a deal with Ankara to drive Kurdish fighters from the region.\n\nLast week, Esper said he would press NATO allies \u201cto take collective and individual diplomatic and economic measures in response\u201d to Turkey\u2019s incursion into northeastern Syria, even as critics have pointed out that Trump\u2019s decision enabled the Turkish offensive.\n\nIn a speech on Thursday in Brussels before the NATO meeting, Esper is expected to call out Turkey\u2019s actions.\n\nAccording to prepared remarks, Esper will say Turkey\u2019s actions jeopardize the progress made in Syria.\n\nStatements by the Pentagon criticizing Turkey in the past month have had little impact on Ankara.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security think-tank, said Esper has few options to punish NATO member Turkey at NATO.\n\n\u201cAs far as NATO-level punishment, I don\u2019t see really what is possible,\u201d Rizzo said.\n\nShe said Trump\u2019s initial decision to pull out of northeast Syria was seen in Europe as enabling Turkey to carry out the incursion and the latest sign that they could not rely on the Trump administration.\n\nA number of European countries have suspended weapons sales to Turkey.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Friday decried NATO\u2019s inability to react to what he called Turkey\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d offensive, and said it was time Europe stopped acting like a junior ally when it came to the Middle East.\n\nGermany\u2019s defense minister has told lawmakers she wants to get the U.N. Security Council to approve a safe zone in northern Syria.\n\nTrump has defended his decision to move most troops out of Syria. He said on Wednesday that the ceasefire in northern Syria is now permanent and lifted sanctions on Turkey as a result.\n\nFUTURE OF ISIS FIGHT\n\nThe American pullout from northeastern Syria has raised concern that it could allow a resurgence of Islamic State militants.\n\nEsper is expected to meet with counterparts from Germany, France and the Britain to discuss how the fight against Islamic State militants can continue and what it would look like, a senior U.S. defense official said.\n\nMany U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, have expressed dismay over Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from Syria, clearing the way for Turkish troops to battle Kurdish forces who for years helped U.S. troops fight Islamic State militants, taking the brunt of the casualties.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nThe fate of Islamic State militants in Syrian Kurdish prisons remains up in the air.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said while most ISIS (Islamic State) fighters remained under lock and key, it appeared that a small number had escaped from prisons.", "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper is expected to focus on Turkey's recent offensive into northeastern Syria and the future of the fight against Islamic State when he meets with NATO partners in Brussels this week, but he has limited options in dealing with either issue.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444439600&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0OT", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
