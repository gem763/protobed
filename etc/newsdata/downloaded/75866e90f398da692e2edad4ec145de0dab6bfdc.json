On Thursday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of the few senators to back Trump's policy, blocked that resolution from coming up for a vote, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) panned it as \"backward looking,\" saying he would prefer \"something even stronger.\"\n\nThe net effect was no action by the Senate. \"History will show that the country, the Senate, and even the senator from Kentucky will regret blocking the resolution,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said afterward, referring to Paul. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) introduced a bill to impose strict sanctions against Turkey, specifically targeting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, but McConnell hasn't committed to taking it up.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) stepped into the inertia to publicly roast Trump's troop withdrawal, explain the accurately predicted consequences, and criticize the weak \"pause\" in fighting Turkey agreed to and Trump touted as a great victory:\n\nRomney went through various defenses of Trump's policy and rebutted them. \"Are we incapable of understanding and shaping complex situations? Russia seems to have figured it out,\" he said. \"Are we so weak and so inept diplomatically that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey?\"", "description": "On Wednesday, 129 House Republicans joined every House Democrat to pass a nonbonding resolution condemning President Trump's abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from northeastern Syria, paving the way for Turkey to invade and slaughter America's Kurdish allies.
