It now has more than 2.1 million customers in the US and counts Klarna, Quadpay, Sezzle, and Affirm as its main competitors.\n\nBut as awareness has grown, the company has drawn criticism from people who say that service isn't any better than a traditional credit card as it encourages young shoppers to spend more than they have.\n\n\"The buy now, pay later mantra is intriguing as smaller payments are seemingly more affordable, but this tool can get many shoppers into trouble,\" Andrea Woroch, a money-saving expert, wrote in an email to Business Insider.\n\nShe continued: \"Those who don't manage the number of purchases they make using Afterpay are likely to miscalculate their budget and what they can actually afford.\"\n\nThose that overspend and find themselves in a position of not being able to pay within 10 days of the payment due date are then subjected to a late payment fee of $8.\n\nIn 2018, Afterpay drew scrutiny for these late fees after its year-end report in June 2018 revealed that nearly a quarter of its revenue stemmed from this. Since then, it has implemented a late-fee cap (25% of the order value) and this portion of its revenue dropped to 18.7%.\n\nMolnar said the company is \"very proud\" of this. \"It's the opposite of how traditional credit products make their money,\" he said. \"We don't rely on customers going late in order for our business to be comfortable.\"\n\nIn fact, he sees Afterpay not as a modern equivalent to a credit card but a budgeting tool that customers can use to better align their purchases with their pay cycle. In the US, for example, it's common to be paid bi-weekly.\n\nIn the future, Molnar envisions Afterpay being used as a way to take on the cost of more expensive purchases such as airline tickets, dental treatment, or homeware, he said. This is already underway in Australia, where Afterpay partners with airline Jetstar.\n\nBut the US market is still in its early days.\"We're still scratching the surface there,\" he said.", "description": "In a conversation with Business Insider, Afterpay cofounder and CEO Nick Molnar, explained why millennials are drawn to buy-now, pay-later services.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5667162e84307662008b84cc-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
