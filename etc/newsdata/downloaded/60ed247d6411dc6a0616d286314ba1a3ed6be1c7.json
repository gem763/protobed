While he still holds around 60 million shares in the software unicorn worth $US7.3 billion ($10.9 billion), he has been offloading around $US1.3 million every trading day since February 21. Loot of that magnitude could abate a lot of carbon \u2013 or even just buy Lady Mary Fairfax\u2019s mansion on Sydney Harbour.\n\nAccording to his latest Form 144 lodged with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Magic Mike has cashed out $US175 million this year. His vastly more bearable co-founder Scott Farquhar has done the same, selling 620,000 Atlassian shares in the three months to August 30. That's $520 million of free cash between them.\n\nPrincipals\u2019 share trading is more opaque in the United States than in companies listed on the Australian bourse. Little wonder, then, that Cannon-Brookes and other tech Rich Listers like WiseTech Global\u2019s Richard White would like the ASX to adopt the Nasdaq regime. Of course they would.", "description": "Loot of that magnitude could abate a lot of carbon \u2013 or even just buy a mansion on Sydney Harbour.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4485%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c7a46e811362130a7c640aa1049475b697eb4f1b", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
