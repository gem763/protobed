Mr Dunn, head of maintenance at an independent school, was called to the scene of the collision by a firefighter, a family friend who recognised Harry.\n\nMr Dunn, who described Harry as 'the centrepiece of the family and an amazing lad', asked police whether the driver had been injured, and was told she was fine. Harry suffered multiple horrific injuries and died in hospital.\n\nThe crash took place in August outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire (pictured) \u2013 a US intelligence hub in Britain\n\nBoris Johnson said it is 'not right' to use immunity in this way, and has promised to raise the case with Mr Trump if it is not resolved.\n\nMrs Charles, who works in a GP surgery, said the family did not want to see Mrs Sacoolasjailed - only to speak to her and for the case to be concluded.\n\nShe added: 'We won't stop... diplomatic immunity is there to protect the diplomat and or their family when they are in danger - it is not there to protect them when they commit crimes as serious as this.'\n\nShe also said Harry's twin, Niall, was 'devastated' and was trying to 'rediscover who he is' after the death of his brother.\n\nThere are around 23,000 people entitled to diplomatic immunity in the UK. In 2017, 26 crimes were allegedly committed by people with immunity. Five of these were driving-related.\n\nThe Sacoolas family were said to have lived in a rented property in a village less than two miles from the scene of the tragedy.\n\nMrs Sacoolas briefly sent the couple's children to Winchester House School, where Harry's father worked as a caretaker.", "description": "Tim Dunn and\u00a0Charlotte Charles say they are being denied justice after\u00a0Ann Sacoolas, who allegedly knocked down their son in Northamptonshire in August, fled to the US.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett For Mailonline", "Claire Duffin", "Arthur Martin For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/09/19481282-0-image-a-2_1570609428945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
