Schiff took a pointed shot at spymaster Joseph Maguire Thursday as the panel began grilling the acting Director of National Intelligence about President Trump\u2019s phone call with his Ukranian counterpart.\n\n\u201cYou stood silent when an intelligence professional under your care and protection was ridiculed by the president, was accused of potentially betraying his or her country when that whistleblower by their fact of coming forward has shown more dedication to country, more of an understanding of the president\u2019s oath office than the president has ever demonstrated,\u201d the California Democrat said.\n\nBut Mr. Maguire pushed back, saying he talked with his staff about the matter but didn\u2019t see the need to comment publicly.\n\n\u201cI did not remain silent,\u201d he said, adding that he issued a statement to his workforce assuring them whistleblowers will be protected.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to issue a public statement,\u201d he said, which drew scorn from Mr. Schiff.\n\n\u201cIt was not only appropriate, but nothing would have given more confidence to the workforce than to hear [publicly from you],\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cI think it would have meant a great deal.\u201d\n\nLater in the hearing, Mr. Maguire said there was too much \u201cerroneous\u201d reporting out there, that he didn\u2019t see a need to respond to every report.\n\nMr. Maguire, who was appointed to the position last month, appeared before the committee amid House Democrats ramping up impeachment efforts following the release of a phone call transcript between Mr. Trump and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn the call, Mr. Trump asks his counterpart to launch an investigation into Democratic presidential front-runner Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter, who secured lucrative contracts in Ukraine.\n\nAn unidentified member of the intelligence community filed a whistleblower complaint last month with intelligence community watchdog Michael Atkinson.\n\nMr. Atkinson labeled the complaint urgent and turned it over to Mr. Maguire. But Maguire stonewalled Congress after the Department of Justice concluded it didn\u2019t meet the threshold to provide the complaint to Congress.\n\nSpeaking Thursday, Mr. Schiff called the intelligence chief\u2019s actions, \u201cbewildering.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have struck me as a good and decent man, which makes your actions over the last month, all the more bewildering,\u201d Mr. Schiff said.\n\nBut the ranking member on the committee defended Mr. Maguire, saying the inspector general had found flaws with the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\u201cThe complaint relied on hearsay evidence by the whistleblower,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican. \u201cThe inspector general did not know the contents of the phone call at issue. The inspector general found the whistleblower displayed arguable political bias against Trump. The Department of Justice investigated the complaint and determined no action was warranted.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department said Wednesday it reviewed Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call for possible campaign finance violations \u2014 a federal felony \u2014 and concluded there was no crime.\n\nMr. Nunes also called the impeachment drive \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cunhinged,\u201d saying Democrats are out to bamboozle the American public.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operations against the president and their extraordinary ability to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also issued a stark warning to the intelligence director, warning him Democrats will try to destroy him through his testimony.\n\n\u201cBecause what you say,\u201d Mr. Nunes cautioned. \u201cThey will use your words against you.\u201d\n\nMr. Maguire fired back, describing his lengthy service in the U.S. Navy and then as a top intelligence community official.\n\n\u201cIn my nearly four decades of public service my integrity has never been questioned until now,\u201d he said. \u201cI have upheld my responsibility to follow the law every step of the way in the matter that is before us today.\u201d\n\nRep. Mike Turner, Ohio Republican and a member of the intelligence committee, said Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president did cross lines \u2014 \u201cThis is not OK,\u201d he said \u2014 but the lawmaker said the whistleblower who complained about it got much of the substance wrong.\n\n\u201cIt is not what\u2019s in the complaint,\u201d Mr. Turner said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
