(Image: Rocksteady Games)\n\nThis weekend \u2014 September 21 specifically \u2014 is DC\u2019s annual celebration of all things Batman: Batman Day, an absurd holiday that has the audacity to not even put itself on the right date.\n\nBut silliness aside, this year Batman Day has been made a little more special due to the fact that DC Comics is also celebrating 80 years of stories with the Dark Knight, with everything from special events to the launch of Detective Comics #1000 earlier this year.\n\nTo celebrate the big Bat-Day itself though, game publisher Epic has revealed that its current slate of free-to-download games on its oft-argued-over Epic Games Store launcher is all Batman-themed. Signing up for an account (if you\u2019ve played Fortnite like seemingly everyone under the age of 15 on the planet has, you\u2019ve probably got one already), and installing the launcher gets you not one but six Batman games for PC that are yours to keep.\n\nThe first three are the original trio of Lego Batman games \u2014 Lego Batman: The Video game, Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes, and Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. They\u2019ve got nothing to do with the Lego Batman of the movie universe, they\u2019re instead entirely original stories told in that playful Lego video game style, full of things to collect, bad guys to aimlessly wail at, and irreverent blocky charm.\n\nThey\u2019re great kids\u2019 games, but also great and earnest Batman stories if you prefer your Bruce Wayne a little less grimdark and a little more Bright Knight.\n\nGet yourself some Batman gaming goodness for free this weekend. It\u2019s what Bruce would want. (Image: Epic)\n\nThe other three, however, are right up your Crime Alley (sorry not sorry, Tom and Martha) if you prefer your Batman a little more traditional and a lot more Kevin Conroy. The other half of the collection is none other than Rocksteady\u2019s excellent Batman Arkham series: Asylum, City, and the most recent Knight.\n\nThese aren\u2019t just great games that re-invigorated third-person action combat as we know it in Western gaming today, a trend that still influences everything from the Middle-earth games to Bruce\u2019s other superheroic videogaming contemporary, Spider-Man. They\u2019re also just absolutely fantastic stories about a new yet familiar interpretation of the Dark Knight.\n\nIt\u2019s a love letter to everything that has endured about Batman for eight decades now, and while it doesn\u2019t take bold twists to the Bat-mythos in a manner of something like the Telltale Batman adventure game series, across three extremely fun stealth-action games you\u2019re getting a set of stories and character arcs that revel in Batman\u2019s history, what he means as a character to his fans, and a celebration of some of his best and brightest foes.\n\nAnd hey, considering it\u2019s Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as the Batman and Joker all over again, if you\u2019re an Animated Series fan it\u2019s basically a spiritual sequel that you just happen to play instead of watch. If you\u2019ve never played them before, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to experience a character-defining take on Batman in a new medium. If you have? Easy excuse to fire them up again and celebrate 80 years of Batman shenanigans. Batmanigans?\n\nAnyway, The Lego Batman Trilogy and Batman: Arkham Collection are available to download for free on PC through the Epic Game Store until September 27.", "description": "This weekend \u2014 September 21 specifically \u2014 is DC\u2019s annual celebration of all things Batman: Batman Day, an absurd holiday that has the audacity to not even put itself on the right date....", "authors": ["Nathan Grayson", "Stephen Totilo"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/chufm5kjwxhpuxwski2e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
