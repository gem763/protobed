She is clearly struggling and not yet familiar with the best way to hold a baby that is covered by a blanket. Her hand position is also awkwardly placed. https://t.co/xOeo26d84E \u2014 Stanga (@Pork_Nocker) July 10, 2019\n\nTo learn whether the Duchess of Sussex's baby holding aligns with expert recommendations, Business Insider spoke with Manhattan-based certified nurse midwife Risa Klein:\n\nMost babies don't have the strength to hold up their own heads before 4 months\n\nIt turns out, internet critics aren't wrong in their appraisal of Markle's baby-holding skills, at least in how it's presented in this single photo.\n\nWhile the photo could have captured Markle in an awkward moment that didn't last, and plenty of other photos show her holding Archie just fine, in this one, the Duchess is not supporting Archie's head and neck, a mistake that could cause his head to bob around or fall backward, potentially leading to a neck or spinal injury, Klein said.\n\nIt takes time for babies to develop the neck strength that toddlers and adults have in order to hold their heads up all of the time. According to Klein, babies can typically begin to support their own heads when they're 4 months old, but until then, whoever is holding the child has to help them out.\n\n\n\n\"It's a safety issue,\" Klein said. \"People shouldn't be criticizing her, but it is the physiology of why the baby needs to be supported.\"\n\nYour pointer finger and thumb can support a baby's head\n\nTo ensure a baby's safety, a new parent should place their left hand at the base of the baby's skull, Klein explained. Their pointer finger and thumb should be positioned on either side of the baby's neck to provide the support the baby needs to stay stable and prevent any injuries.\n\nIf a mom is breastfeeding or formula feeding the baby, she can support his or her head in the crook of her left elbow, and her forearm can run along the baby's back and spine. Then, she can place her hand on the baby's butt to keep him in place. \"Her right hand would be free to do what she wants,\" Klein said.\n\nAdditionally, Klein recommended on-the-go moms like Markle try a sling to carry their babies on their bodies. This method would allow both hands to remain free while still supporting the little one's head and neck.\n\n\n\nIf you're unsure how to hold your baby, Kelin suggested hiring a post-partum doula to teach you, or attending community classes for new moms.\n\nRegardless of how you learn, Klein said it's an essential parenting skill and one that new moms like Markle shouldn't be shamed out of learning.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Until they're about 4 months, babies need their parents to support their heads and necks.
