But I also believe in Parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nMr Hammond attempted to defend his decision today, tweeting: I believe in delivering Brexit. But I also believe in Parliamentary scrutiny'\n\n'That\u2019s why I voted for the Brexit bill to progress to the next stage, but against No10\u2019s plan to rush it through at breakneck speed.\n\n'Now\u2019s the time for cool heads, to calmly consider the Bill.;\n\nMr Johnson had wanted his Withdrawal Agreement Bill to be rushed into law so he could meet the October 31 deadline.\n\nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg admitted it was 'very hard to see how it is possible' now for the Bill to be passed in time for next week.\n\nMr Hammond and Mr Clarke, who were stripped of the Tory whip last month over attempts to block No Deal, were joined in voting against Mr Johnson's Commons timetable by fellow ex-Tories Guto Bebb, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Richard Harrington, Anne Milton, Antoinette Sandbach and Mr Stewart.\n\nEXILED GRANDEES: Philip Hammond, Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke\n\nTORY REBELS: Anne Milton, Antoinette Sandbach and Richard Harrington\n\nRory Stewart, Justine Greening and Guto Bebb\n\nTheir votes against the Government are likely to have destroyed any hopes of being allowed back on the Tory benches. In a sign of the acrimony over their move, European Research Group chairman Steve Baker last night tweeted: 'It feels like there will be a candidate selection in Runnymede shortly.' The tweet appeared to be a clear reference to Mr Hammond's Runnymede and Weybridge constituency.\n\nAt the end of a nail-biting evening in the Commons, the Prime Minister told MPs he would now 'pause' the Withdrawal Agreement Bill until the EU takes a decision on whether to grant another Brexit delay.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow last night told Commons that the legislation was now 'in limbo'.\n\nMr Johnson, who had pledged to take Britain out of the EU by the Halloween deadline 'do or die', told the House he would now consult with other EU leaders on what should happen next\n\nBut Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg added: 'I think theologically speaking it was reported that Pope Benedict XVI abolished limbo, so I do wonder whether the Bill is not in the heaven that is having been passed, nor in the hell of having failed, but it is in purgatory where it is suffering the pains of those in purgatory.'\n\nOn the first vote last night, MPs voted to back the deal in principle by 329 to 299 on the second reading of the Bill \u2013 the first time the Commons has been prepared to support any Brexit deal.\n\nIn that vote, 17 of the 21 former Tories who lost the whip in September voted to support the deal. However, in the second vote on the programme motion, nine of those 21 Tories voted against the Government. The vote appears to have to put paid to the PM's hope of leaving with a deal at the end of the month in eight days' time.\n\nMr Johnson, who had pledged to take Britain out of the EU by the Halloween deadline 'do or die', told the House he would now consult with other EU leaders on what should happen next.\n\nUnder the terms of the so-called Benn Act, the PM was forced to write to the EU at the weekend seeking an extension after failing to win the support of the Commons at Saturday's special sitting.\n\nHe told MPs: 'I will speak to EU member states about their intentions. Until they have reached a decision we will pause this legislation.' He added: 'Let me be clear. Our policy remains that we should not delay, that we should leave the EU on October 31 and that is what I will say to the EU and I will report back to the House. And one way or another we will leave the EU with this deal, to which this House has just given its assent.'\n\nNigel Farage last night tweeted: 'Do or die is over, we have now moved on to dying in a ditch. We will not be leaving the EU on 31st October.'\n\nMr Hammond and Mr Clarke voted against the Government's fast-track timetable despite warnings from fellow ex-Tories Sir Oliver Letwin and Richard Benyon it would be a mistake.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons debate beforehand, Mr Benyon said: 'Whether you had three days, three weeks or three months debating this, you would not hear one original argument that we hadn't otherwise heard in this process.'\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn had urged MPs to challenge the timetable, calling it 'an abuse of Parliament'.\n\nIn the earlier vote on the second reading on the Bill, the Prime Minister seized victory after securing the support of 19 Labour rebels.\n\nThe Prime Minister won over the opposition MPs with a slew of promises on how workers' rights and environmental standards would be protected after the country leaves the EU.\n\nIn the Commons debate, Mr Johnson gave repeated assurances over the issues to Labour waverers, but he failed to get the support of the Democratic Unionist Party's ten MPs, who voted against the deal and also the fast-paced legislative timetable.\n\nMPs crowding the benches and the aisle as they await the results of the vote on the programme motion proposing a timetable for the passage of the Brexit Withdrawl Agreement Bill in the House of Commons\n\nBelow is a full tally of how your MP voted on the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill and the subsequent vote on the timetable.\n\nSecond Reading: European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill Aye Count: 329 CONSERVATIVE Nigel Adams (Conservative - Selby and Ainsty) Stuart Andrew (Conservative - Pudsey) Iain Stewart (Conservative - Milton Keynes South) Bim Afolami (Conservative - Hitchin and Harpenden) Adam Afriyie (Conservative - Windsor) Peter Aldous (Conservative - Waveney) Lucy Allan (Conservative - Telford) David Amess (Conservative - Southend West) Edward Argar (Conservative - Charnwood) Victoria Atkins (Conservative - Louth and Horncastle) Richard Bacon (Conservative - South Norfolk) Kemi Badenoch (Conservative - Saffron Walden) (Proxy vote cast by Leo Docherty) Steve Baker (Conservative - Wycombe) Harriett Baldwin (Conservative - West Worcestershire) Stephen Barclay (Conservative - North East Cambridgeshire) John Baron (Conservative - Basildon and Billericay) Henry Bellingham (Conservative - North West Norfolk) Paul Beresford (Conservative - Mole Valley) Jake Berry (Conservative - Rossendale and Darwen) Bob Blackman (Conservative - Harrow East) Crispin Blunt (Conservative - Reigate) Peter Bone (Conservative - Wellingborough) Peter Bottomley (Conservative - Worthing West) Andrew Bowie (Conservative - West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) Ben Bradley (Conservative - Mansfield) Karen Bradley (Conservative - Staffordshire Moorlands) Graham Brady (Conservative - Altrincham and Sale West) Suella Braverman (Conservative - Fareham) (Proxy vote cast by Steve Baker) Jack Brereton (Conservative - Stoke-on-Trent South) Andrew Bridgen (Conservative - North West Leicestershire) James Brokenshire (Conservative - Old Bexley and Sidcup) Fiona Bruce (Conservative - Congleton) Robert Buckland (Conservative - South Swindon) Alex Burghart (Conservative - Brentwood and Ongar) Conor Burns (Conservative - Bournemouth West) Alun Cairns (Conservative - Vale of Glamorgan) James Cartlidge (Conservative - South Suffolk) William Cash (Conservative - Stone) Maria Caulfield (Conservative - Lewes) Alex Chalk (Conservative - Cheltenham) Rehman Chishti (Conservative - Gillingham and Rainham) Christopher Chope (Conservative - Christchurch) Jo Churchill (Conservative - Bury St Edmunds) Colin Clark (Conservative - Gordon) Simon Clarke (Conservative - Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) James Cleverly (Conservative - Braintree) Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Conservative - The Cotswolds) Therese Coffey (Conservative - Suffolk Coastal) Damian Collins (Conservative - Folkestone and Hythe) Alberto Costa (Conservative - South Leicestershire) Robert Courts (Conservative - Witney) Geoffrey Cox (Conservative - Torridge and West Devon) Stephen Crabb (Conservative - Preseli Pembrokeshire) Tracey Crouch (Conservative - Chatham and Aylesford) David T.
