And, oh voil\u00e0, the EU\u2019s outgoing chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier needs a new job.\n\nThe rejection of Goulard was no political hit job. It was the culmination of months of frustration over how Macron and his Renew Europe group have attempted to push through the lofty ambitions of his Sorbonne speech \u2014 a classic French platter of a more centralized and more expensive Europe.\n\nMacron once said of Johnson that he \u201cenjoys giving flamboyant speeches but has no strategic vision.\u201d He might have been talking about himself. As much as Macron likes to present himself as Europe\u2019s selfless savior, in reality he\u2019s been delivering a Brussels nightmare.\n\nHis missteps in recent months have had wholly negative effects for the EU, leaving a gaping hole in the new European Commission and complicating Commission President-designate Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s already difficult job.\n\nPutting forth Barnier would be a chance for Macron to turn things around. The former French minister and two-time commissioner has shepherded the EU through the Brexit talks with remarkable constraint, given the confused, and often contradictory, position adopted by a revolving door of British negotiators.\n\nHe has also, in a most unexpected way, maintained the unity of the remaining 27 countries in supporting the concerns of Ireland regarding the peace process in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe might also, if Westminster obliges by finally getting Brexit done, relish a new challenge away from the crazy brigade of the British Tory party. Compared to Brexit, dealing with the Alstom-Siemens whinge-fest would feel like a pleasant walk by the Seine.\n\nTo be sure, appointing Barnier \u2014 a long time member of the European People\u2019s Party \u2014 would require Macron to shed the pride of unfettered leadership and the prejudice of traditional politics. But he should find consolation that he\u2019d have found the right person for the job.\n\nThe first months of a new mandate are critical in setting the tone of the years to follow, and Barnier would be integral in steadying the incoming team. His appointment would solidify the coterie of cross-party expertise in key portfolios and lend a steadying hand to an incoming Commission president unused to the currents of Brussels decision-making.\n\nHis positions on four key policy pillars \u2014 trade, security/migration, the economy and the environment \u2014 also support both Macron\u2019s and von der Leyen\u2019s priorities for Europe.\n\nHis appointment would, however, require the acquiescence of the EPP, the Socialists and Renew Europe in the parliament.\n\nUnlikely? Perhaps. Impossible? No.\n\nThe EPP would benefit from supporting Barnier as something that\u2019s best for Europe, especially he were presented as an independent commissioner, devoid of any political allegiances. His elevation could also help the group pivot back toward a more centrist position on the European spectrum.\n\nFrustration with Macron and his grouping is high. Renew Europe is only the Parliament\u2019s third largest group \u2014 they would do well to remember that their irrelevance is only contained by their ability to work and compromise with others.\n\nThe youngest French president in history has already secured a powerful portfolio for the new French commissioner and a French head of the European Central Bank.\n\nBut unless he can swallow his pride now, he\u2019ll struggle to make good on his self-confessed raison d\u2019\u00eatre: strengthening the European center against the tides of populism.\n\nEoin Drea is senior research officer at the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies.", "description": "Now that he\u2019s seen the UK out the door, he can help France come out of the cold.", "authors": ["Eoin Drea", "David M.
