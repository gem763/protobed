The government has proposed to increase its budget for next year by 9.3 percent from this year\u2019s budget.Kim also argued against worries that Korea is experiencing deflation, saying that the negative inflation rate last month was caused by supply factors such as increased agricultural goods and a drop in crude oil prices.Korea\u2019s consumer price index fell 0.4 percent last month from the previous year, entering negative terrain for the first time since the data started being recorded in its current form in 1965. Core inflation, which removes volatile factors such as agriculture and petroleum prices, also remained low at 0.6 percent last month compared to the near 1 percent level earlier this year.Despite the government calling for calm against worries to the economy, global credit ratings agencies have been pessimistic about Korea\u2019s economic growth this year.S&P earlier this week reduced Korea\u2019s GDP growth for this year to 1.8 percent, down from its 2 percent forecast made in July.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
