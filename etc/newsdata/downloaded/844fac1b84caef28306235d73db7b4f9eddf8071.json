In the meantime, check out this rather unusual tale:\n\nRemember the old Lays Potato Chips commercial from back in the 1980s that bragged \u201cNo one can eat just one\u201d?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWell, ask NHRA Pro Stock driver Alex Laughlin and a few members of his team, and they\u2019ll tell you they learned a very valuable lesson that there indeed IS a chip that you can only eat one of.\n\nAccording to NHRA\u2019s National Dragster, Laughlin and Elite Motorsports crew members Chase Freeman, Kelly Murphy and Brian Cunningham took part Friday night in the Paqui One Chip Challenge.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of the Challenge, Paqui Chips has produced a tortilla chip that the company boldly claims is the hottest chip ever made anywhere in the world. The secret is the \u201cCarolina Reaper\u201d pepper, considered the hottest chili pepper in the world, with a rating of 1.9 million Scoville units, according to PuckerButt Pepper Company.\n\nHow hot is 1.9 million Scoville units? Let\u2019s put it this way: the Devil might even have a hard time taking this kind of heat. By comparison, a Jalapeno pepper only reaches 10,000 units on the Scoville rating.\n\nSo while they were enjoying some downtime Friday night after the first two rounds of qualifying for the NHRA Carolina Nationals at zMAX Dragway in Concord, North Carolina (suburban Charlotte), Laughlin and Co. paid $30 for one chip \u2013 you read that right, $30 for one chip, it\u2019s THAT hot \u2013 and thought they could take the heat.\n\nThey thought wrong.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis is the hottest chip in the world,\u201d Laughlin said on an Instagram post that documented the entire experience, adding a warning, \u201cWhat to expect: Mouth on fire, short-term loss of speech, impaired vision from tears, extreme profanity \u2014 or death.\u201d\n\nLaughlin\u2019s post also includes several reader comments that Laughlin and his crew should have had milk on hand instead of water to try and cool things down because milk has a natural antidote to cool your mouth down after eating hot food.\n\nSunday morning, with his mouth and throat still a bit sore, Laughlin recalled the red-hot episode to National Dragster\u2019s Kevin McKenna:\n\n\u201cNever again. Never. Ever. Ever,\u201d Laughlin told McKenna. \u201cIt was definitely not the smartest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\n\u201cOne of our guys showed me a You Tube video and it looked like it wasn\u2019t going to be too bad. I like spicy food and it\u2019s usually never a problem. I\u2019ve been to those places with hot wings where you have to sign a waiver before you eat them and that\u2019s never been a problem.\n\n\u201cBut this? This is on a whole different level. I thought it might last ten minutes. Fourteen hours later, I was still in bad shape. I woke up at 3 a.m. and Googled \u201cinternal bleeding.\u201d I seriously thought I was going to die. We all did.\u201d\n\nSo if the heat from the chip was off the hotness Richter scale, where did the stunt rank on Laughlin\u2019s own personal Richter scale?\n\nI\u2019ve done some dumb things, but this is right up there.\n\n\u201cWell, I really didn\u2019t think it would be that bad,\u201d Laughlin told McKenna with a shrug. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just one tortilla chip. Like I said, I can usually eat stuff that other people won\u2019t eat, but I had no idea what I was in for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done some dumb things, but this is right up there.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re up for another challenge in the future that involves eating hot food, Alex, here\u2019s a suggestion: Even though it\u2019s a few years old now, maybe you should try the Ice Bucket Challenge (but fill it with milk) to cool down quick. Just a thought.\n\nFollow @JerryBonkowski", "description": "It likely will be a long time before NHRA Pro Stock driver Alex Laughlin takes on another challenge.
