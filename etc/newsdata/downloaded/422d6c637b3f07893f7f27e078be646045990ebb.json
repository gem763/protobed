Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIn the aftermath of last month\u2019s mass shooting in El Paso, former Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke initiated a campaign reboot that saw him turn his focus to gun control and frequent use of the word \u201cfuck.\u201d For the first time in months, the rising star turned also-ran won some positive attention. Even his rivals lavished him with praise at last weeks\u2019 Democratic debate in Houston.\n\nBut that was before O\u2019Rourke said this: \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke clearly went into the debate prepared to make the statement. His campaign even tweeted a link to buy a shirt with the line on it before the candidate was off the stage.\n\nBut less than a week later, O\u2019Rourke strategy is being criticized by members of both parties for potentially scuttling gun-control legislation before it gets off the ground. Democratic senator Chris Coons responded the day after the debate with a prediction. \u201cI frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns,\u201d he told CNN, apparently unaware that gun groups have been saying this for years anyway.\n\nSouth Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg also took issue with the politics of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal in an interview CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Asked if O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pledge is \u201cplaying into the hands of Republicans,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cYes.\u201d Democratic congressman David Cicilline joined the critics too, saying O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201cmessage doesn\u2019t help\u201d with the effort to pass bipartisan gun reform.\n\nGOP senator Pat Toomey echoed the same sentiment, tweeting that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rhetoric \u201cundermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks.\u201d\n\nThen on Wednesday, President Trump chimed in. \u201cDummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cConvinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away.\u201d O\u2019Rourke responded without wavering.\n\nTo be clear: We will buy back every single assault weapon.\n\n\n\nWe\u2018ll also license every gun & do a background check on every buyer. That\u2019s what the American people want\u2014and deserve.\n\n\n\nThe only thing stopping us from ending this epidemic is you & your cowardice. Do the right thing. https://t.co/lPqAv1r9ij \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) September 18, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s criticism of O\u2019Rourke comes as he seems to be seeking a way to wriggle out of endorsing any gun-control measures. He\u2019s dragged his feet on the issue for weeks, to the point that Republican lawmakers are publicly complaining about his lack of leadership.\n\nOn Monday, he began blaming Democrats for the inevitable failure of bipartisan gun legislation.\n\n\u201cDemocrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.\u201d Governor John Sununu @FoxNews @BillHemmer The big questions are, will they \u201cmove the goalposts\u201d and, is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? I hope NOT on both counts, but I\u2019ll be able to figure it out! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nNow he\u2019s found a new scapegoat, blaming O\u2019Rourke for the lack of progress toward legislation that he was never serious about anyway.", "description": "Trump, as well as Democrats, have said that presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pledge to buyback AR-15s and other assault weapons was a bad political move.
