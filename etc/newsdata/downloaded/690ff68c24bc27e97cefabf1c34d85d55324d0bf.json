The September 2018 story was apparently sourced to fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a fierce enemy of the president\u2019s and now Democratic Party backer.\n\nThe emails were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, a conservative investigative non-profit.\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the emails stand as more evidence that the FBI mounted a coup to try to bring down Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable that Judicial Watch has done more to investigate the DOJ/FBI\u2019s discussions about overthrowing President Trump than the DOJ or Congress,\u201d Mr. Fitton said on Wednesday. \u201cThese documents essentially confirm the coup discussions about wearing a wire when speaking with President Trump and plans to remove him under the 25th Amendment.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, the Justice Department became a hotbed of intrigue. Mr. Rosenstein and successor McCabe apparently talked frequently about a plan of action that culminated in the deputy AG naming special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. McCabe opened a counter-intelligence investigation targeting the president himself as a possible Russian agent.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s March 2019 report cleared Mr. Trump of involvement in any Russian election conspiracy. There was no evidence offered that Mr. Trump was a Russian agent.\n\nThen-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Mr. McCabe in March 2018 for allegedly lying to investigators in another probe dealing with the Hillary Clinton email saga.\n\nIt was in the post-Comey firing intensity that Mr. Rosenstein said he talked of wearing a wire in jest.\n\nThe New York Times conveyed to Justice public affairs that Mr. Rosenstein also spoke of invoking the 25th Amendment, which sets a process for removing an incapacitated president.\n\nThe information, again, appears to have come from Mr. McCabe who had been out of office several months and would write an anti-Trump memoir.\n\nMr. McCabe also told the Times that Mr. Rosenstein wanted to reach out to the fired Mr. Comey to get recommendations on a special counsel.\n\nMr. Rosenstein, who resigned in April, ended up issuing a statement:\n\n\u201cThe New York Times\u2019s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the Department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: based on my personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
