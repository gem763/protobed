Most customers have an option provided by their smartphone vendor, like Apple, Android, or Samsung Pay. But those are often supplemented by a myriad of options from other players, ranging from tech firms like PayPal, to banks and card issuers, to major retailers and restaurants.\n\nWith that proliferation of options, one would expect to see a surge in adoption. But that's not the case \u2014 though Business Insider Intelligence projects that US in-store mobile payments volume will quintuple in the next five years, usage is consistently lagging below expectations, with estimates for 2019 falling far below what we expected just two years ago.\n\nAs such, despite promising factors driving gains, including the normalization of NFC technology and improved incentive programs to encourage adoption and engagement, it's important for wallet providers and groups trying to break into the space to address the problems still holding mobile wallets back. These issues include customer satisfaction with current payment methods, limited repeat purchasing, and consumer confusion stemming from fragmentation. But several wallets, like Apple Pay, Starbucks' app, and Samsung Pay, are outperforming their peers, and by delving into why, firms can begin to develop best practices and see better results.\n\nThe Mobile Payments Report from Business Insider Intelligence addresses how in-store mobile payments volume will grow through 2021, why that's below past expectations, and what successful cases can teach other players in the space. It also issues actionable recommendations that various providers can take to improve their performance and better compete.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\nUS in-store mobile payments will advance steadily at a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to hit $128 billion in 2021. That's suppressed by major headwinds, though \u2014 this is the second year running that Business Insider Intelligence has halved its projected growth rate.\n\nTo power ahead, US wallets should look at pockets of success. Banks, merchants, and tech providers could each benefit from implementing strategies that have worked for early leaders, including eliminating fragmentation, improving the purchase journey, and building repeat purchasing.\n\nBuilding multiple layers of value is key to getting ahead. Adding value to the user experience and making wallets as simple and frictionless as possible are critical to encouraging adoption and keeping consumers engaged.", "description": "A new report from BI Intelligence addresses how in-store mobile payments volume will grow through 2021, why that\u2019s below past expectations, and what successful cases can teach other players in the space.", "authors": ["Jaime Toplin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b72e256959f345d118b4f27-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-18"}
