The conclusions were meant to suggest that the EU\u2019s NPPs are unsafe. However, not only is an EIA a legal requirement that is only required in certain circumstances, it is entirely unrelated to safety.\n\nTo address safety considerations, there are bespoke EU stress tests along with national appraisals. However, headline-grabbing news \u2013 like the European Court of Justice\u2019s (ECJ) recent ruling that a 2015 decision to extend the life of two Belgian nuclear power plants by 10 more years was unlawful because Brussels failed to conduct EIAs \u2013 effectively serves to undermine popular support of nuclear power.\n\nThat the Belgian greens reacted to the ECJ ruling by stating that \u201cthe energy transition towards renewable energy must now be accelerated\u201d indicates greens remain deeply skeptical of nuclear power, while championing renewables.

That\u2019s only second to hydropower, which accounts for 16 per cent. It warns that without policy changes, advanced economies could lose 25 per cent of their nuclear capacity by 2025 and as much as two-thirds of it by 2040. If you\u2019re worried about CO2 levels, that\u2019s bad news. Without nuclear power, emissions from electricity generation would have been almost 20 per cent higher between 1971 and 2018, according to the IEA.\n\nDespite policy changes in countries like Germany and Belgium, 50 new nuclear reactors are currently being constructed around the globe (15 of which are in China alone), and new technologies are constantly being developed. Take small modular reactors (SMRs), which are much safer thanks to their reliance on \u201cpassive\u201d, less energy-consuming systems. Companies as diverse as NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce and China National Nuclear Corp. (CNNC) are betting on their success.\n\nAnd therein lies the rub: while many proponents of renewables and battery technology point at how future technological development will sort out their many shortcomings, very few assume technological progress is possible for nuclear technology. On the contrary, innovations are routinely dismissed out of hand and painted as dangerous.\n\nCase in point is the the Akademik Lomonosov floating nuclear power plant, which Greenpeace dubbed \u201cChernobyl on ice\u201d a bid to play up fears about it before it even set off from Murmansk to Russia\u2019s arctic region. That scaremongering ignores the fact the plant is meant to replace a coal-fired power plant and an ageing nuclear power plant, eliminating about half a million tons of CO2 emissions per year.\n\nWhile the Lomonosov is the first of its kind, nuclear reactors have been going to sea since 1955, ever since the first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus set off. It\u2019s no surprise then that Finland's Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) has declared that the transport of Akademik Lomonosov along the Gulf of Finland \u201cwill not pose any concern\u201d.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of skepticism towards nuclear energy, it\u2019s important to look at how environmentally friendly and economically efficient renewables are. The production of solar panels and wind turbines requires hazardous materials and \u2013 unlike in the case of nuclear waste \u2013 there are no proper plans on how to deal with these by-products, which are expected to hit 78 million metric tonnes by 2050.\n\nIn a special report on Germany\u2019s 2011 decision to phase out nuclear energy, Der Spiegel notes that the \u201cgreatest political project undertaken since Germany's reunification, is facing failure\u201d. The magazine notes how \u201cmost of the electricity that Germany needs is still produced by burning coal.'' It adds that \u201ctechnologically speaking, it's possible to make the energy system free of fossil fuels by 2050,\u201d but that it could cost Germany up to \u201c\u20ac3.4 trillion\u201d. This, after German electricity prices have already gone through the roof in recent years.\n\nAccording to the magazine, \u201cthere is hardly a wind energy project that is not fought\u201d, with citizens wary of electrical transmission towers pushing politicians to bury electrical lines \u201cunderground\u201d, which is \u201cmany times more expensive and takes years longer.\u201d As a result, the magazine concludes that \u201cthe wind power boom is over\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Germany\u2019s decision was a kneejerk reaction to the Fukushima disaster in Japan, a move that was not endorsed by all environmentalists. One of the UK\u2019s most respected environmental activists, George Monbiot, wrote that \u201cas a result of the disaster at Fukushima, I am no longer nuclear-neutral. I now support the technology\u201d, explaining that this really amounted to the ultimate test for nuclear power: \u201cA crappy old plant with inadequate safety features was hit by a monster earthquake and a vast tsunami.[\u2026] Yet, as far as we know no one has yet received a lethal dose of radiation\u201d, a figure revised by the Japanese government to 1 last year.\n\nAs always in politics, it\u2019s never black and white. A fair debate must involve taking into account the pros and cons of all energy sources. It also means examining both the present and future potential of a technology to respond to the world\u2019s energy challenges. And with all things considered, nuclear energy deserves a fairer chance.", "description": "Last month, a report by Germany\u2019s Green party\u00a0concluded that\u00a018 nuclear power plants in the European Union are operating without having been subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
