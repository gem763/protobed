In the last few decades, wine, in particular, has gained a reputation for being good for our health. Red wine even has been linked with longevity and lower risk of heart disease.\n\nBut could wine really be good for us?\n\nThe first question, of course, is what we mean by \u201cgood for us\u201d. Many people think of heart health when we think of the potential upsides of wine.\n\nWhat is less well-known is that research has found strong links between alcohol and cancer. One bottle of wine per week is associated with an increased absolute lifetime cancer risk for non-smokers of 1% for men and 1.4% for women. This equates one bottle of wine per week to five cigarettes for men, or 10 for women.\n\n\u201cWhile a lot of work [has] been done to communicate the link between smoking and cancer, this is less so for alcohol because public health officials control messaging for smoking, whereas with alcohol, it\u2019s largely been up to the alcohol industry to communicate this itself,\u201d says Mark Bellis, director of policy, research and international development at Public Health Wales.\n\nYou might also like:\n\n\u2022 Is beer better for you than wine?\n\n\u2022 Why alcohol affects women more than men\n\n\u2022 Why do only some people get blackout drunk?", "description": "We\u2019ve been led to believe that an occasional glass of wine might be better than abstaining from alcohol altogether, but that might not be the case.", "authors": ["Jessica Brown"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7r/b1/p07rb1pk.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
