He's tried both, but his journey to fatherhood has been full of challenges.\n\nThe long road to being a dad\n\nA four-year relationship ended when Thorn's former partner said he wouldn't sign an adoption application.\n\n\"It was hard and devastating. We ended things the next day,\" Thorn recalled.\n\nDespite the breakup, Thorn went ahead with the adoption papers.\n\n\"I filled out the paperwork within 24 hours, every single question and box that needed to be checked, I filled it out and submitted the paperwork. And my journey had really started right then.\"\n\nNot long after filling out the paperwork, Thorn was told there was a child that seemed to be a perfect fit for him. After reviewing the case files, he realised that the child had needs that exceeded his capacity as a single parent. He had to say no.\n\nWith his name still on the adoption list, Thorn began his surrogacy journey. A friend offered her eggs, and six embryos were created. He found a surrogate and they did an embryo transfer.\n\nThorn is grateful for all the kids in his life, but has always wanted a child of his own. (Shawn Thorn)\n\n\"I was in the room transferring an embryo into this woman who was going to carry my baby. It felt like a confirmation. I held her hand and it was really beautiful,\" said Thorn.\n\nThe pair waited a few days, took a pregnancy test, and it came out positive. Elated, Thorn thought his journey to fatherhood was finally complete. At the same time, he was told of another child he could adopt, but because of the pregnancy, he declined.\n\nThree weeks later, his surrogate miscarried.\n\nI was really devastated. - Shawn Thorn\n\n\"I was really devastated,\" said Thorn. \"I really felt like it was done, I was just done, that I couldn't go through this anymore.\"\n\nBut he didn't give up.\n\n'I can't wait to hold him'\n\nFriends stepped in with crowdfunding to help him pay to make a new batch of embryos. They also introduced Thorn to a new surrogate.\n\nNow, after six unsuccessful attempts to implant embryos, two miscarriages, and lines of credit totalling $75,000, Thorn is finally going to be a father. His baby boy is due on October 13, 2019.\n\n\"I have felt beside myself since the day we found out that he existed,\" said Thorn.\n\nShawn Thorn met his fianc\u00e9, Vincenzo Coia, while he was trying to conceive. Coia has also created embryos with the same egg donor Thorn used. (Frank Wang Photography)\n\nHis son may even get a sibling one day. Thorn's fianc\u00e9, Vincenzo Coia, whom he met while trying to conceive, has also made embryos with the same egg donor Thorn used. But for now, both men are counting down the days until their first baby arrives.\n\n\"I can't wait to see his face. I can't wait to hold him. I can't wait to feed him,\" said Thorn. \"I can't wait to lay on the sofa with him on my chest and just smell his hair and his baby smell. And I can't wait for the two of us to walk down the street holding his hand.\"", "description": "Shawn Thorn's lifelong dream was to be a dad.
