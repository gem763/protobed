Those cuts came on Wednesday, as the Fed announced a cut of the main target rate to a range of 1.75 to 2 per cent.\n\nDonald Trump, who had repeatedly slammed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and demanded the Fed do a sweeping cut to the current rate, tweeted shortly after the announcement: \"Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\"\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

If needed, he said the Fed would be willing to make \"significant\" changes to the current rates in order to preserve US economic standing, but that the labour market \u201cremains strong\u201d and \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a moderate rate\u201d.\n\nThe Fed would \"act as appropriate\" in order to maintain the economy's upward trajectory, it said in a statement announcing the change.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
