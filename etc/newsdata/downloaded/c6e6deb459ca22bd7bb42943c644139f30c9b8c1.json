Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign announced Wednesday that the campaign would be laying off staff and literally betting the farm on Iowa.\n\nThe memo, obtained by VICE News, was written by campaign manager Juan Rodriguez and describes an \u201corganizational realignment to go all-in on Iowa.\u201d He praises the fundraising efforts of the campaign so far \u2014 $35 million raised to date \u2014 but concedes a \u201ccompetitive resources environment\u201d is leading to a cash crunch.\n\n\u201cPlenty of winning primary campaigns, like John Kerry\u2019s in 2004 and John McCain\u2019s in 2008, have had to make tough choices on their way to the nomination, and this is no different,\u201d Rodriguez writes. Neither one of those candidates won the presidency.\n\nHarris raised $11.6 million during the third quarter of the fundraising cycle, which was a slight drop off from her second quarter fundraising which was $11.8 million. Unlike Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Harris partakes in closed-door, high-dollar fundraisers where wealthy donors can max-out their contributions to her campaign.\n\nThe memo also includes a thinly-veiled swipe at some of her primary competitors, \u201cThis requires us to make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks.\u201d\n\nBoth Senator Cory Booker and Secretary Julian Castro made public appeals for fundraising in the last few weeks, saying that if they didn\u2019t reach certain dollar goals, they would quit the race. Both men have stayed in.\n\nHarris campaign press secretary Lily Adams confirmed the announcement via Twitter, saying that \u201cCampaigns are about tough choices and this one is no different.\u201d\n\nThe campaign will be laying off staff at the Baltimore headquarters. Rodriguez noted that he would be taking a pay cut, along with campaign consultants, and other contracts would be renegotiated.\n\nHe also explained a shift in manpower: the campaign will deploy staff from offices in New Hampshire, Nevada, California and some from headquarters to Iowa, showing an all-in bet that they\u2019re making on the first state in the presidential primary race. The South Carolina staff will remain intact.\n\nCover: Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. Sen.
