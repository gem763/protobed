Then we received a letter in the post from Sanctuary Housing to say we owed just over \u00a32,000 in rent.\n\n\u201cWe were gobsmacked to be told housing benefit had been deducting \u00a3100 each month for the overpayments.\n\n\"We also found out our housing benefit had stopped when we went on to Universal Credit, and Universal Credit had paid us the rent and not to Sanctuary Housing like we had asked.\u201d\n\nKatie says she rejected for discretionary housing payments due to the rent arrears as well as a repayment plans.\n\n\u201cWe were told if we didn\u2019t pay the whole lot off we were out,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like a failure and a bad mum because I had lost our family home. There was nothing I could I do but cry.\u201d\n\nKatie and her family were evicted at the end of February having searched unsuccessful for a private landlord.\n\nAfter staying with her brother in Cheshire she was housed in different hotels back in Torquay and then a cottage temporarily in Paignton by Torbay Council.\n\nHowever, she alleged they were given two weeks\u2019 notice to find accommodation after being told by Torbay Council it no longer had a care of duty to help them.\n\nWith nowhere else to go, Katie says her daughter had to temporarily live back with her father in Torquay.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nKatie said: \u201cI was devastated. My teenage daughter not being around me caused my anxiety to spiral, but I knew it was the only way. It left me and my partner on the streets and split us up as a family.\n\n\u201cI was so angry they could do this to us; I was born and breed in Devon and I was being treated like this.\n\n\u201cWe had been given a budget of \u00a3555 rent allowance for a two-bed property, but nearly all properties was \u00a3650 plus. It was impossible to find a home but we kept at it.\u201d\n\nAfter four weeks of sleeping between family and friends, and on the streets, Katie sought the help of their local MP and social media.\n\nIt prompted a team leader of housing options to overturned the decision, and Katie and her partner were reunited with her daughter and were placed back into a hotel.\n\nHowever, five weeks\u2019 late they are still in the hotel in one room, and Katie says their situation has now become desperate.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are truly grateful to be given accommodation, but we are struggling being in one room and are at breaking point.\n\n\"My daughter and partner are sharing a room which is wrong; we are living off takeaways as there are no cooking facilities which is making our health worse; our room hasn\u2019t been cleaned since we\u2019ve arrived, and my daughter is getting detentions from school as she can\u2019t do her online homework as we don\u2019t have the internet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis situation is taking its toll on us as a family so I am pleading for help for me and my family.\n\n\u201cAll we are asking for is help to be put on Devon Home Choice to get a better chance of an affordable settled home for us, to be treated fairly, and for the local council to hold their hands up and admit that the system is at fault.\n\n\u201cWe would also like them to compensate us for the last seven months' of our lives that\u2019s been torture for us as a family and is still ongoing to this day.\u201d\n\nIn response, Sanctuary Housing said they had tried to help Katie, but eventually had no option but to evict her from the property as her rent arrears continued to rise.\n\nA spokesperson for the association said: \"Eviction is always a last resort.\n\n\"We have great sympathy for Ms French\u2019s situation and worked with her over many months to try to help her sustain her tenancy, making multiple home visits, offering to refer her to local advice agencies and clarifying that Universal Credit is a single benefit from which rent must be paid.\n\n\"Sadly, the rent arrears continued to rise which meant we were left with no other option than to take legal action and make the property available to another family.\u201d\n\nA Torbay Council spokesperson said: \u201cWe cannot comment on individual cases but what we can say is that we do have a process to follow which includes taking a homeless application and making a decision in line with legislation.\n\n\"We are committed to ensuring the needs of individuals are met and will continue to support them in line with our statutory duties and until they find suitable alternative accommodation.\"", "description": "The mum of a teenage girl has described the \"torture\" of being homeless after issues with housing benefit led to her eviction", "authors": ["Anita Merritt", "Image", "Katie French", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20411768.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AMR_DCM_02102019_french011.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
