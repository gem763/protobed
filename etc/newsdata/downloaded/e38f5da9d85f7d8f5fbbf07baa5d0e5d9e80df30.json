President Nixon later said the scandal had contributed to his narrow defeat to John F. Kennedy.\n\nAs President George H.W. Bush tried to deal with the fallout from the savings and loan crisis, he was also contending with an uncomfortable fact: His own son Neil had served on the board of Denver-based Silverado Savings and Loan, which went bankrupt, costing taxpayers more than $1 billion.\n\nLike Billy Carter before him, Neil Bush insisted he had done nothing wrong, and no evidence emerged that he had received preferential treatment from the government.\n\nBut his role at the bank caused major political problems for his father.\n\nYouTube\n\nLikewise, Billy Carter's ties to Libya led to a congressional investigation and caused a major scandal for his brother, who had come to office promising to run an honest administration after Watergate.\n\nThe fact that Billy Carter was never charged with any crime almost didn't matter, says presidential historian Julian Zelizer of Princeton University.\n\n\"Very often there's nothing wrong. Nothing is actually done that's illegal. Nothing is done that's formally unethical, and rarely has it affected public policy. But that's different than, 'Does it become a scandal?' It looks bad,\" Zelizer says.\n\nNow, it's former Vice President Biden's turn to contend with a relative's questionable business dealings.\n\nPresident Trump has vigorously sought to raise questions about Hunter Biden's activities. In fact, Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the younger Biden are at the center of the current impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nBut Trump has relatives making business deals too. Trump has never really separated himself from his family's business, the Trump Organization, which is run by his sons Eric and Donald Junior, and the family has frequently been accused of seeking to profit off the presidency.\n\nThe Trumps' business dealings are even more questionable, Zelizer says, because Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, actually work in the White House.\n\n\"Billy Carter was not in the White House. He was not making decisions with the president, and that was the case with Neil Bush too. So what we're talking about now is fundamentally different,\" Zelizer says.", "description": "Relatives of presidents and vice presidents have lots of opportunities to cash in on their famous relative's name, and more than a few have done so.", "authors": ["Jim Zarroli"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/29/ap_800821064_wide-7a3d800415dfdfd5453cbb1ce3b3b0bb680400f4.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
