Why?", "language": "en", "text": "Photo-Illustration: by Preeti Kinha; Photos: Getty\n\nLast year I got curious about wearing a device that claimed to measure my health by way of my heart rhythms. More than my health, it supposedly measured my personality, in a way \u2014 or at least my stress levels and emotional resiliency. It sounded ridiculous, but I also wanted to know.\n\nThis device kept track of my heart-rate variability, or HRV. Essentially, the wristband (or chest strap) listens to your heartbeats and then gives you a number between one and 100, which it calculates using a complicated algorithm. This number (supposedly) expresses your general mind-body stress level \u2014 in fact, it (supposedly) accounts for all forms of stress: emotional, physical, and mental. Low numbers are \u201cbad,\u201d indicating stress and the need for recovery, while high numbers are \u201cgood,\u201d and indicate readiness and well-being.\n\nA friend had described what it was like to wear her own HRV monitor. Her HRV readings would drop \u2014 that is, get \u201cworse\u201d \u2014 when she was having a hard time at work, hungover, or not sleeping enough. The bad readings so closely tracked her real-life stress that eventually I couldn\u2019t resist. I wanted to know: What\u2019s my heart doing? I\u2019m sober, I exercise, my numbers must be through the roof! So I contacted a couple companies to request two different kinds of HRV monitors, and I wore them both, on and off, for a few months.\n\nBut first, I had to actually understand what HRV is, which turned out to be a challenge.\n\nWhat is heart-rate variability (HRV)?\n\nHRV is like heart rate, but a degree more zoomed in: It counts how many times your heart beats, but it also measures the milliseconds of difference between those heartbeats. Hearts aren\u2019t like metronomes, and apparently the more stressed out and rundown you are, the more regular your heartbeat becomes, whereas the more peaceful and energetic you are, the more irregular your heartbeat is. The difference between heartbeats (or, HRV) also fluctuates with the breath \u2014 another way to think of it is as a measurement of the difference between your heart rate when you\u2019re breathing in (faster), and your heart rate when you\u2019re breathing out (slower). It\u2019s also used to measure the tone of the vagus nerve, which is associated with overall steadiness and calmness. (Measuring HRV is essentially an attempt to measure the autonomic nervous system, which regulates things like breathing, heart rate, and digestion, all of which are thought to reflect stress levels.)\n\nYour HRV numbers are more or less a measurement of \u201cyour body\u2019s ability to be responsive,\u201d fitness device company Polar\u2019s president, Tom Fowler, told me. Consistently low HRV numbers \u201ccan be a great wakeup call\u201d to start taking better care of yourself, he said, whereas consistently high numbers should be taken advantage of \u2014 to seize the day, exercise, or go on a spontaneous date (or something like that). At this point I started to think of HRV readings as almost like heartbeat-based horoscopes, or mood rings.\n\nSo far these devices have mostly been used by elite athletes. A 2018 study found that competitive cyclists, for instance, performed better when they planned workouts around HRV readings than when they relied on traditional training programs. (And some lay people, like my friend, are beginning to use HRV monitors to keep an eye on the effects of day-to-day stressors, like short sleep and alcohol intake, although their numbers seem to be relatively small.)\n\nWhat I used\n\nHRV can be monitored with both chest straps and wrist straps, and I tried one of each.\n\nI linked the chest strap (a Polar H10 Heart Rate Sensor, $89.95) to two apps: the Polar app, and an app called Elite HRV. I wore the strap under my sports bra all day, checking in on it during exercise sessions and to take two-minute HRV \u201csnapshots\u201d at random times. This system reliably gave me numbers indicating I was in the healthy/normal range for my age and gender (like \u201c52\u201d out of 100).\n\nThe wristband (called a WHOOP, starting at $180 for a six-month membership) came with its own app, and I wore the watchlike waterproof device around the clock, including while I slept. It also monitored my sleep (telling me which cycles I was in and for how long), tracked my athletic strain and \u201crecovery,\u201d and gave me daily single-number overall ratings. The HRV numbers it gave me were so low (like \u201c23,\u201d which almost no one in my age/gender range seemed to be getting) that I almost took it off after the first day.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nThroughout the months that I used these devices, my numbers stayed mostly the same: The Polar device continued to give me normal, reassuring numbers, while the WHOOP consistently read low, dispiriting ones. (It wasn\u2019t until the end of the experiment that I learned that the Polar measures moment-to-moment waking HRV, while the WHOOP measures a single HRV fluctuation captured during a particular moment in the sleep cycle \u2014 specifically the first five minutes of my final \u201cslow-wave sleep stage.\u201d So, my low numbers were based on a lone yet telling moment of wacky sleep? I don\u2019t know. I give up; these devices were not for me.)\n\nI took my low numbers as a sign that I need to sleep more (or do something better \u2014 I actually thought I was sleeping okay), but ultimately it was a relief to take both devices off altogether. If I were more of an athlete, I imagine HRV tracking might have a more obvious benefit. In the meantime, it was fun (well, it was stressful and confusing) to scratch the itch.", "description": "Trying wristband and chest-strap heart rate variability (HRV) monitors, a non-athlete monitors her sleep quality, stress levels, and emotional resiliency.
