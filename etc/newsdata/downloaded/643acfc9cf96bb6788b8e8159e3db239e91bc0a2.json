It appears that Safari in iOS 13 now sends browsing data to Tencent, a giant Chinese conglomerate that owns the country\u2019s biggest digital platforms, including QQ, WeChat and Qzone. It\u2019s also known for helping the Chinese government keep its iron grip over what citizens can see and interact with on the internet.\n\nThe feature in question is Safari\u2019s Fraudulent Website Warning. At face value, this sounds like a good thing \u2014 it\u2019s meant to protect users from bad websites often used in phishing scams. In fact, Apple has long used Google\u2019s Safe Browsing technology. How that works is if a user tries to visit a URL that\u2019s been flagged as malicious, you\u2019ll see a pop-up warning you not to visit the site.\n\nThe main change here is that in iOS 13, the \u201cSafari & Privacy\u201d fine print now says, \u201cBefore visiting a website, Safari may send information calculated from the website address to Google Safe Browsing and Tencent Safe Browsing to check if the website is fraudulent. These safe browsing providers may also log your IP address.\u201d\n\nWhile it wasn\u2019t initially clear if non-China users\u2019 data was being sent to Tencent, Apple has since clarified in a statement that it only impacts users in mainland China.\n\n\u201cApple protects user privacy and safeguards your data with Safari Fraudulent Website Warning, a security feature that flags websites known to be malicious in nature. When the feature is enabled, Safari checks the website URL against lists of known websites and displays a warning if the URL the user is visiting is suspected of fraudulent conduct like phishing,\u201d an Apple spokesperson told Gizmodo in an email. \u201cTo accomplish this task, Safari receives a list of websites known to be malicious from Google, and for devices with their region code set to mainland China, it receives a list from Tencent.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Victoria Song, Gizmodo\n\nThat sounds above board, but safe browsing isn\u2019t entirely private. In a blog about the update, Johns Hopkins University professor Matthew Green noted the first iteration of Google\u2019s technology was a \u201cprivacy nightmare.\u201d Originally, Google\u2019s servers basically received the entire URL of sites you visited, as well as your IP address.\n\nRealising this, Google changed how its safe browsing tech worked, implementing partial hashes to give you a degree of privacy. However, the Google servers still see your IP address and other types of identifying information. According to Green, because a typical user will visit thousands of URLs, a malicious provider could still de-anonymise users as they \u201cwill gradually leak details about their browsing history to the provider, assuming the provider is malicious and can link the requests.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to Tencent. As mentioned earlier, Tencent owns a number of popular internet platforms in China. As such, it\u2019s an active participant in censoring content online. WeChat, a messaging app owned by Tencent, censors private conversations automatically in real-time, as well as filtering images.\n\nEarlier this year, Tencent\u2019s QQ browser, among others, was found blocking access to a GitHub page where developers vented workplace grievances. It\u2019s also been reported Tencent will develop \u201cpatriotic\u201d video games for the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nApple\u2019s warning acknowledges the Fraudulent Websites Warning feature will send your IP to Tencent \u2014 and users will just have to trust it won\u2019t succumb to possible government requests to de-anonymise that data. Given its history of bowing to pressure from the Chinese government with regard to censorship, that isn\u2019t encouraging.\n\nApple told Gizmodo its feature never shares the exact URLs you visit with providers. Safari regularly receives a list of URL prefix hashes that apply to malicious sites. If that matches the hash of a site you try to navigate to, Safari asks the provider for the full list of malicious URLs with the same hashed prefix. If your URL matches one on the list, you\u2019ll be shown a warning that you\u2019re navigating to a dangerous site. All of these checks are done on your device, so the provider never receives the actual URL you visited. However, because Safari directly communicates with the safe browsing provider, that provider will still get your IP address.\n\nThis comes at a time where Apple has reportedly caved to demands from the Chinese government. Last week, it pulled a smartphone app used by pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. Apple CEO Tim Cook later doubled down on the decision, stating in a letter that the app was \u201cin violation of Hong Kong law\u201d despite some calling into question the legitimacy of Cook\u2019s claims.\n\nLikewise, a Buzzfeed News report alleges Apple told some Apple TV+ show developers to \u201cavoid portraying China in a poor light.\u201d\n\nWhile safe browsing does have its benefits, if this news gives you pause, you can turn off Safari\u2019s feature by going to Settings > Safari > Fraudulent Website Warning.", "description": "It seems like Apple\u2019s China-related controversies aren\u2019t over just yet.
