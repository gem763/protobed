That being said, while he agrees that some crises can have a positive influence on Bitcoin\u2019s price \u2014 citing the crisis that took place in Cyprus \u2014 overall, he is confident that BTC operates in accordance with macro factors, not against them. Lee stated:\n\n\u201cIf I had to say Bitcoin\u2019s a macro hedge then I would say that the evidence should mechanically show bitcoin price does best when the S&P has a bad year. Let me give you the evidence in the years when the S&P has been down since bitcoin\u2019s inception \u2014 bitcoin has averaged a negative 19% annual return.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is up when the S&P 500 is up\n\nLee also noted that in the years during which the S&P index was below its long-term average return \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s average gain was 300%. At the same time, in the years that have seen the index gaining 15% or more \u2014 BTC\u2019s average gain was 1,800%. Lee concluded:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s best years have all taken place in the years where the S&P has performed very well.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s stance is in contrast with the ideas expressed by the CEO of crypto payments firm Circle, Jeremy Allaire, who suggested at the beginning of August that macroeconomic turmoil is responsible for the growth that Bitcoin has seen at the time.", "description": "Bitcoin is positively correlated with the S&P 500 and is not a hedge against macro turmoil, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee", "authors": ["Adrian Zmudzinski"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMmVlYzIzODExMDRiMjJhZjBjMDczZjZhOGEwODQxYTIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
