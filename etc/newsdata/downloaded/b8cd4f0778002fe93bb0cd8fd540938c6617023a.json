Thousands from disadvantaged communities in the Amazon and the Andes have traveled to Quito where they are spearheading demands that the subsidies continue.\n\nDemonstrators on Saturday ransacked and set fire to the building housing the comptroller general's office, which was shrouded in thick smoke after being attacked with fire bombs.", "description": "A first meeting between Ecuador's president and indigenous leaders will take place on Sunday, the United Nations said, after Lenin Moreno ordered a curfew and military control in the capital to try to quell deadly, anti-austerity protests.", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse", "Tom Welsh", "Julie Burchill", "Daniel Hannan", "Jacob Rees-Mogg"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212870200-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq4lB4GFcd2ffyksCJoOxtkYfY5cP4-mwTMc4rd9Xa9X8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
