Pearson's obituary went viral when it announced he had no immediate family and all are welcome to attend. But it's been revealed he had two sons\n\nMore than 2,000 people recently attended a funeral for a veteran because they didn't want him to be buried alone, but a Florida newspaper reports that the man did in fact have immediate kin.\n\nThe Sarasota Herald-Tribune wrote Saturday that Edward Pearson had two sons.\n\nOne told the paper their father walked out on them when they were teens.\n\nThe family did not know of Pearson's passing until the day before the October 1 service, and by that time, the funeral home had invited the public to attend, saying he had no immediate family.\n\nLiz Pearson, Edward Pearson Jr.'s ex-wife, says the family found out too late to make arrangements to travel to Sarasota.\n\nShe says they would have attended if they had known about it sooner.\n\nPearson, a resident of Naples, Florida, died August 31.\n\nHis obituary went viral when the funeral director included this sentence in the service announcement: This veteran has no immediate family and all are welcome to attend.\n\nAn honor guard member holds up a folded American flag during the open funeral service. A friend of Pearson's said he would have been overwhelmed by the thousands who stood in the heat to send him off\n\nMourners touch the urn containing the remains of U.S. Army veteran Edward K. Pearson during an open funeral service on Tuesday, October 1, 2019, at the Sarasota National Cemetery\n\nNews of the ceremony at an open-air pavilion area at the Sarasota National Cemetery spread fast and wide in veterans' forums and on social media networks. CNN host Jake Tapper and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted the information.\n\nFor many in the region - a place with thousands of retirees and veterans - it was impossible to think they wouldn't attend.\n\n'You know what? There's no way I'm going to let him do this alone,' said Willie Bowman, 62, a Purple Heart recipient and career Army veteran. 'I've never met the man. But he's a veteran and he's a brother of mine.'\n\nPearson was born in Pennsylvania and moved to Florida 25 years ago. He worked at a grocery store for a bit, and at a hardware store. One woman in the community got to know him after Hurricane Irma in 2017: Patty Thrasher, a customer service representative for the Collier County Tax Collector's office.\n\nThe storm had damaged the roof of Pearson's mobile home. Water rained into the kitchen through a blue tarp and when Pearson sought government aid to help with repairs and needed a title, Thrasher discovered that he didn't actually own the home at all.\n\nPearson is pictured standing outside his home shortly after shaking President Donald Trump's hand during a brief visit in September 2017.

Pearson during the funeral service\n\nCemetery officials say it's not uncommon for veterans to die - and be buried - without family.\n\nThe man who sold him the home wasn't actually the owner, but a swindler who took advantage of an elderly person, she said.\n\nWith Thrasher's help, the community came together to secure a title for the home, fix the roof and pay a past electric bill.\n\nPearson told Thrasher that he didn't want to 'be on the news' for his plight and was hesitant to ask for help at all. He was preparing to move into a new place when he died.", "description": "A Florida funeral home invited the public to attend the funeral of an 80-year-old Army veteran who had no immediate family.
