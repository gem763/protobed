(The most recent, Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women\u2019s Anger, is out in paperback now.)\n\nShe writes about women and power, so naturally she\u2019s been pretty busy the last few years. On this week\u2019s podcast, Stella Bugbee talked to Rebecca about how she gets it done \u2026 starting with breakfast.\n\nSTELLA: We\u2019re going to start where we always start, which is: What is your morning like?\n\n\n\n\n\nREBECCA: Well, my morning is made infinitely easier by the fact that I have a husband who does all the morning cooking and who actually is much better at getting up in the morning than I am.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTELLA: What does he make?\n\n\n\n\n\nREBECCA: It varies. Sometimes he just makes cereal, sometimes he makes oatmeal, sometimes he makes egg sandwiches, sometimes he makes \u2026 If we\u2019ve had tacos the night before, he makes breakfast burritos. Like, it\u2019s really good.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTELLA: Wow. I\u2019m coming over.\n\n\n\n\n\nREBECCA: It\u2019s really good in my house. My morning is the best part because I wake up and there\u2019s breakfast. Then my part comes, which is, like, wrestling my 4-year-old into clothes. And weirdly with a 4-year-old, there\u2019s still a lot of peeing and brushing. [Laughs.] Like, reminding: \u201cPee and brush! Pee and brush!\u201d Right? [Laughs.] There\u2019s a weird amount of my time, both morning and night, that is spent saying \u201cPee and brush.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSTELLA: Let\u2019s just be clear for our listeners, we\u2019re talking about brushing teeth \u2026 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s evident to those who don\u2019t have to tell another human to pee and brush. And then when do you start working?\n\n\n\n\n\nREBECCA: Well, that depends. I mean, sometimes I will have already started working. I wish I were healthy and kept my phone in a closet or something, but I don\u2019t. It\u2019s right beside my bed. I\u2019m looking to see what\u2019s happening as soon as I wake up.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTELLA: Do you do that so that you can respond quickly on Twitter or do you do that because you might have a column that you think of,\n\nor \u2026?\n\n\n\n\n\nREBECCA: I do it so that I know what the day is like. Especially in the past few years, when things have moved so quickly and the days are so full of horror, I find it psychologically easier. Though I\u2019m sure that if I had time for therapy, a therapist would tell me that it makes it much worse \u2026 I find it easier to know from the start the day I\u2019m walking into.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTELLA: And when you say that, you mean like whether or not some politician has done something horrible? Or whether or not we\u2019re in a nuclear war? What are you looking for?\n\n\n\n\n\nREBECCA: I find it easier to know when I get up and I\u2019m walking to school that, like, Donald Trump has issued a ban on transgender people in the military. I don\u2019t find it easier to know that, but I find it easier to know it early than be surprised by it two hours into my day. I can hear the voice of an imaginary therapist in my head being like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s better to just walk to school and take your kids and give them hugs\u201d \u2014 and, you know, whatever. For me, I feel like an asshole if I\u2019ve been like, \u201cWhoo! Hey, everybody,\u201d on the street and not known the horror that has already happened in the world and in this country. I don\u2019t know.", "description": "From Hillary Clinton to #MeToo to 2020 and beyond, Rebecca Traister is an indispensable guide to politics in this country.
