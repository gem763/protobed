Sales lost in Hong Kong due to the political turmoil in the region were largely made up in other markets, company management said in a conference call.\n\nThe closely watched Gucci brand posted EUR2.37 billion revenue for the quarter, growing organically by 11% compared to the same period the previous year and above analysts' expectations of EUR2.33 billion, according to a consensus forecast provided by FactSet.\n\nDuring the previous quarter, Gucci posted organic-revenue growth of 13%, a considerable slowdown compared to the first quarter of the year. The result sent shares in Kering falling as investors took it as a sign of rapidly-slowing momentum at the brand, which, according to Jefferies analysts, generates nearly 80% of the group's earnings before interest and tax.\n\nThe Bottega Veneta brand, which had been working to remedy weak sales, registered 6.9% organic sales growth in the quarter. Kering said the result was highly encouraging.\n\n\"We live in an increasingly complex world, but we are fully confident in our capacity to deliver sustained performances over time,\" Kering Chairman and Chief Executive Francois-Henri Pinault said in a press release.\n\nWrite to Cristina Roca at cristina.roca@dowjones.com; @_cristinaroca\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 24, 2019 11:55 ET (15:55 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
