Why did they think it was kind or humane to get on a plane and flee? That's what we're struggling to understand.\n\n\"We know, and all the support we\u2019ve had which is global now, they can\u2019t understand why you would just flee.\"\n\n(Image: SKY)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nWhen asked what she would like to happen next, Harry's mum said: \"It's going to take quite a long time. Until hopefully we have the chance to meet her and try to talk about it. See her remorse.\n\n\"Why she was feeling it was the right thing to go.\"\n\nTim added: \"She knew Harry had died. She was told that. I really struggle to understand you know your killed somebody and you think the right decision is to flee the country.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t make sense to me how anybody can see that was the way to go.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Justice4Harry)\n\nThey admitted they don't necessarily want Ms Sacoolas behind bars but do want to get justice for their late son.\n\nCharlotte said: \"We don\u2019t want to take her away from being a mum. We said to our police force we would work with them.\n\n\"They were going for death by dangerous driving. We agreed to reduce it to death by careless driving so we\u2019d get justice but she\u2019d get a suspended sentence and continue being a mum. She\u2019s had six weeks now to come forward.\n\n\"You\u2019d think human to human she\u2019d actually have the decency to say 'let me go. Release me from this diplomatic immunity. I want to go and see them'. That's probably our best hope at the moment.\"\n\n(Image: Justice4Harry)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nTim and Charlotte are pleased that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to speak personally to US President Donald Trump .\n\nHarry's dad said: \"I\u2019m hoping with the pressure from our Prime Minister if they look at the case and reassess what diplomatic immunity means.\"\n\nAdmitting there needs to be an overhaul in the law, Charlotte added: \"We can\u2019t let it happen again. She\u2019s taken our son.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The parents of Harry Dunn, who was tragically killed in a motorbike crash, will fly out to America if Anne Sacoolas doesn't return to the UK", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Universal News", "Europe", "Sky"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20536386.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Grieving-parents-plead-US-diplomats-wife-to-face-justice-for-sons-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
