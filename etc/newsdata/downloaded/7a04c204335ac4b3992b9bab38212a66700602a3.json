That makes Mexico one of the most violent countries for females. And Ecatepec, a humble working class community of 1.7 million residents, has seen more such killings in recent years than any other municipality in Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe women of the \u2018periphery,\u2019 we are the forgotten. We only enter the statistics,\u201d said Magda Soberones, 28, a mother of three and one of the founders of a performance troupe that led the procession in Ecatepec, which is part of \u201cthe periphery\u201d - the band of suburbs that sprawl out from the core of Mexico City to form one of the most extensive urban areas in the world, home to 22 million people.\n\nSoberones\u2019 group calls itself Women of the Periphery for the Periphery and does performance art to call attention to violence against women.\n\nPeople gathered for the caravan\u2019s first stop at the site where little Samantha was abandoned in a blanket, beaten to death in June.\n\nNeighbors recalled hearing shouts in the wee hours of Mexico\u2019s Father\u2019s Day. One woman said she looked out the window and saw a young woman put a bundle on the sidewalk that turned out to be Samantha\u2019s body. The neighbor, fighting back tears and holding a small child of her own, didn\u2019t want to give her name to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cShe never returned to hug her,\u201d the neighbor said of the young mom. \u201cI would have never let her go.\u201d\n\nResidents called police and waited an agonizing hour for a patrol car to arrive. Officers took statements, but have not returned. Samantha\u2019s mother accused a boyfriend of hitting the child. Neighbors said they haven\u2019t seen the couple since.\n\n\u201cJustice for Samantha!\u201d the activists shouted Sunday before placing a needlepoint image of a little girl and Samantha\u2019s name next to a mosaic depicting Jesus on the cross.\n\nThe procession then headed to a field of white and yellow wildflowers where the bodies of a mother and her teenage daughter were found after an evening of dancing. Both had been raped.\n\nAs the activists moved down a narrow street they called out to residents to be more vigilant.\n\n\u201cSir, ma\u2019am, don\u2019t be indifferent. Women are killed right in front of people\u2019s eyes,\u201d they chanted.\n\nMembers of the performance troupe donned long purple skirts and roses crowned their heads. The sound of wind howled on a speaker as the women lifted their heavy skirts to traipse over the tall grass of the field where the half-naked bodies of the mother and daughter were found.\n\nThe performers took turns saying first the name of the mother -\u201cI\u2019m Ang\u00e9lica\u201d- and then the name of the daughter -\u201cI\u2019m Karla\u201d- while twirling skirts in the air like giant butterfly wings.\n\nRelatives of the murdered women sobbed, and the troupe\u2019s members embraced them, crying together.\n\nKarla\u2019s older sister, Ang\u00e9lica Estevez, said the 16-year-old was a homebody who liked to study and didn\u2019t have a boyfriend. The night she was killed was the first time the teenager had gone out to dance, she said. Their mother sold bread at a market and was an avid salsa dancer.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve to die that way - either of them,\u201d said Estevez.\n\nTwo men who have been accused of murdering the women face a hearing in mid-October.\n\nRelatives of other women who have been slain on the outskirts of the capital stepped forward in the field to share their stories, with a common thread of violent deaths, impunity for perpetrators and practically nonexistent investigations by authorities.\n\nLilia Florencio, whose daughter Diana was found raped and strangled a block from home in 2017, described the performance art as a way to \u201cvisualize what is happening in this Mexico that is so hurt.\u201d\n\nShe said the only thing she has gotten from police was a poster a year ago promising a reward for information to solve the crime.\n\n\u201cUs, the mothers, the families, we will continue to demand justice,\u201d Florencio vowed.\n\nThe caravan\u2019s next stop was a memorial to one of Mexico\u2019s most shocking and painful crime sprees: the butchering of more than a dozen women by a single couple. Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez and Patricia Mart\u00ednez, who were arrested last year, admitted to killing at least 20 young women in Ecatepec. They chopped them up, ate body parts and sold bones to religious cults.\n\nThe performance artists held red scarves above lighted votive candles. They handed red carnations to the crowd, and then draped a chain of paper dolls with question marks scrawled on the dolls\u2019 skirts across the memorial to the couple\u2019s victims, most of whom have not been identified.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t organize, this could be one of us,\u201d activist Lizeth Flores warned the crowd.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A memorial caravan wound its way through Ecatepec's streets Sunday carrying white roses in remembrance of a 2-year-old girl who was beaten to death and left on a sidewalk in the Mexico City suburb, one of many killed in a very dangerous country to be female.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Amy Guthrie"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/mexico_murdered_women_47522_c0-181-4320-2699_s1770x1032.jpg?57cd28a37b32a07ccb294e4fb73b6cb600fac0d9", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
