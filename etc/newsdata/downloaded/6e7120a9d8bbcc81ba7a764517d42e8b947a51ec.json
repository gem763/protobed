It seems like people who see a sign that says \u201cout of order\u201d would be deterred from using the machine. They\u2019d turn away and try to utilize another machine or decide against their transaction. Well, apparently things didn\u2019t quite stop there. These allegedly non-functioning machines also came with signs asking customers to scan a QR code that was attached to the machines so that they could \u201cstill purchase bitcoins.\u201d\n\nThe idea was that anyone who bought bitcoins through the QR code would attach themselves to a bitcoin address owned by the thieves. Thus, any money unsuspecting persons bought would ultimately wind up in the hands of the criminals.\n\nOne can see from first glance that this con makes no sense. You put a sign on a machine saying \u201cout of order\u201d to give people the impression that any time spent on or with the machine is wasted, yet you still ask them to scan a code so they can purchase more crypto units? People proved \u201ctoo smart\u201d to fall for this ridiculously silly ploy, and the hackers have thus far walked away with nothing.\n\nThe good news is that only two signs were hung on two different machines, so the hackers didn\u2019t try to initiate anything too serious. Maybe they, themselves, didn\u2019t entirely trust their own plan or lacked confidence somehow.\n\nNevertheless, the police still got involved in the case and put up warning signs on the machines granted anybody couldn\u2019t fully understand what was going on (thankfully, this wasn\u2019t the case).\n\nUsually, Crypto Theft Has Had More Brains Behind It\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that scammers have utilized cryptocurrency ATMs to get their fingers on funds that weren\u2019t theirs. A similar scenario occurred in Australia last year, when cybercriminals tried to scam immigrants who were using bitcoin ATMs. The ploy involved telling the immigrants to place fiat money into a bitcoin ATM and convert it to cryptocurrency, which they would then have to send to a specific cryptocurrency address. This would serve as a special \u201ctax debt\u201d and excuse the immigrants from deportation.\n\nMost other forms of cryptocurrency theft occur in ways that are more complicated, such as SIM-swapping or phony initial coin offerings (ICOs). The former involves bribing employees of a person\u2019s cellphone provider to garner their passwords and user information for mobile accounts (i.e. crypto accounts), while the latter involves raising money for a new venture or startup only to make off with the funds before the business ever comes to fruition (probably because it never existed).", "description": "Hackers in Canada tried to use two bitcoin ATMs to garner funds that weren't theirs, but their plan was too simple and didn't work.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2018/06/shutterstock_787646935-bitcoin-atm.jpg"}
