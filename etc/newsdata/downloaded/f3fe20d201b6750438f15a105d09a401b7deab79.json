Ayhan nodded home six minutes later \u2014 and celebrated with a military salute in front of the Turkish supporters \u2014 to leave Didier Deschamps side waiting.\n\n\u201cWe did what we needed to win the match based on the play and number of chances. They didn\u2019t have many but put away a set-piece,\u201d said Deschamps, whose team lost 2-0 to Turkey in June.\n\n\u201cWe should have been more clinical even if it\u2019s still a good point. We\u2019re still on track and need to finish to job in November.\u201d\n\nTurkey remain top of Group H above the world champions on the head-to-head rule. Although France can qualify for the finals with a win at home to Moldova next month, Turkey would clinch their place by avoiding defeat against third-placed Iceland, who are four points back after beating Andorra 2-0.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Ukraine booked their place in Euro 2020 after squeezing past Portugal as Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 700th career goal on a night", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/101ca2_striking-hero-andriy-shevchenko-has-led-ukraine-euro-2020-ukraine-reach-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
