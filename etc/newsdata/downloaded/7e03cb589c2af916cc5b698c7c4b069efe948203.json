The threats against the NATO ally have carried forward as Vice President Mike Pence prepares to meet with Erdogan on Thursday - if the meeting is unsuccessful, \u201csanctions and tariffs and other things\u201d will follow.\n\nTurkey has insisted its quarrel is not with the Kurds as a people but with the Kurdish militias it considers to be terrorist groups. Erdogan has thus far ignored the pleas of the US and its European allies, several of whom have curtailed weapons sales to Turkey in protest of its military operation in Syria, pressing forward to create a so-called \"safe zone\" 30km within its neighbor's territory.\n\nAlso on rt.com Kurds \u2018no angels and know how to fight,\u2019 Syria conflict between Ankara and Damascus \u2013 Trump\n\nWhile the Kurds - those fighting for the SDF, at least - are considered US allies, Trump has called the Kurdish separatist militia PKK \u201cmore of a terrorist threat in many ways, than ISIS,\u201d echoing Ankara\u2019s assessment. Referring to the matter as \u201ca semi-complicated problem,\u201d he acknowledged \u201cpaying a lot of money to the Kurds\u201d and said he warned a Kurdish general not to \u201clet ISIS out to create havoc\u201d - but seemed to want to wash his hands of the whole thing, leaving Turkey to work out who were terrorists and who were not.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
