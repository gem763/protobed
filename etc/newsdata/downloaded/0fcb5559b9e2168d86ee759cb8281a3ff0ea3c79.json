Not all people are sloppy in their practice, but how precisely we intervene with people who are [needs to be addressed],\" Filion said in French.\n\nMechanic Tyler Simard blames his continuing health problems on the poor treatment he received at the Hull Hospital.

He was given a bed, but was never issued a hospital bracelet or medical chart. Told a specialist was coming to see him, Simard stayed in bed, still wearing the street clothes he'd arrived in, for three days.\n\nAfter three days of waiting in vain, Simard approached hospital staff and told them he was leaving. They objected and told him if he left, he would lose his priority.\n\nCISSSO CEO Jos\u00e9e Filion is vowing to improve health care at Gatineau's two hospitals. (Radio-Canada)\n\n\"I said, 'If you can tell me who I am and what I'm here for, [I'll stay]. I have no wristband identifying who I am, I'm in regular blue jeans and a T-shirt. You couldn't even tell me if I was a patient or not.'\"\n\nSimard left and was admitted to hospital in Ottawa, where within hours he underwent surgery.\n\nFilion defended changes she's made to CISSSO since taking over from Jean H\u00e9bert, who was fired in February.\n\nOn Tuesday, she announced four new priorities for the health authority, including \"continuous improvement.\"", "description": "Responding to an investigative newspaper report showing the\u00a0Gatineau and Hull hospitals lead Quebec in deaths caused by medical error, the regional health authority is blaming what it calls a lack of \"rigour\"\u00a0at the two facilities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4037980.1507926677!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hull-hospital-sign.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
