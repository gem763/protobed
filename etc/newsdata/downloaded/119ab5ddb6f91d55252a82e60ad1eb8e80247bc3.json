Footage captured by one of the passengers shows the moment that the ships hit, with someone aboard the cruise repeatedly saying \u201cnot good, not good, not good\u201d before the collision.\n\nThe Dutch Apple II was returning to dock when the incident occurred, the Times Union reported. Nobody got hurt, but the Dutch Apple II reportedly suffered minor damage.\n\nThe Coast Guard ordered the cruise ship not to carry any passengers until the cause of the collision could be investigated.\n\nA passenger on the cruise ship captured footage of the incident and posted it to Twitter. She captioned it, \u201cOnboard the Dutch Apple Cruises Troy Lock Sightseeing Tour and we just hit the U.S.S. Slater. Captain heard stating \u2018I lost transmissions.\u2019\u201d\n\nFAMILY AWAITING ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISE 'TRAPPED' IN ITALY AFTER THEIR HOTEL ROOM'S SAFE WAS STOLEN\n\nIn a statement obtained by Fox News, a spokesperson for Dutch Apple Cruises said, \"We were instructed to not carry passengers until the U.S. Coast Guard came to do an inspection. Which is standard procedure after any incident.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"After our USCG inspection yesterday, it was deemed that there was an error using the transmission throttle, which caused the engine to come out of gear while trying to dock,\" the statement continues.\n\n\"This, combined with very high winds, caused the boat to quickly drift into the USS Slater. The US Coast Guard has deemed the Dutch Apple to be in perfect working condition, no engine or transmission issues and no structural damage. Only superficial damage was assessed to the boarding doors, which have already been replaced. They also gave us clearance to begin operations again as of yesterday. We have already been out on three cruises since then and have resumed normal operations.\"\n\nThe Dutch Apple II was reportedly ready to take on passengers by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe USS Slater is a decommissioned World War II destroyer escort that now serves as a museum. According to the Times Union, it was also open to visitors on Wednesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story mistakenly referred to the U.S.S. Slater as a destroyer. The ship served as a destroyer escort.", "description": "Guests on a sightseeing tour got to see what happens when a cruise ship collides with another vessel.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/hudson-river.jpg"}
