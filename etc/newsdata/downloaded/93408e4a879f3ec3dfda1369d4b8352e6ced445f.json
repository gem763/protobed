One-bedrooms start at $1.7 million.\n\nAnd the Lagree Baptist Church, which had been based since 1975 in a Beaux-Arts-detailed former movie theater on West 125th Street, has been razed for Eleven Hancock, a glassy 12-story, 71-unit condo. Nortco Development, a Manhattan developer making its first push into Harlem, bought the property from Lagree in 2016 for $28.5 million.\n\nPriced from $585,000, Eleven Hancock offers mostly one- and two-bedrooms, with floor-to-ceiling windows, black-toned kitchen faucets and quartz counters. A three-level space aimed at big box retailers is also in the building, which cantilevers over a neighboring building.\n\nJeff Krantz, an associate broker agent at Halstead Development Marketing who is handling sales, declined to say how many contracts had been signed since sales began in August. But Mr. Krantz, who has lived in Harlem for a decade, said church conversions are a common local sight. \u201cThey\u2019re doing deals to raise capital,\u201d he said.\n\nImage Baptist Church of the Redeemer at Flatbush, pictured here in the summer of 2015, had fallen into disrepair. \u201cThere was water coming in everywhere,\u201d the pastor said.\n\nNon-divine Intervention\n\nWith more than 900 sites in Manhattan currently classified as religious buildings \u2014 a list that includes synagogues, rectories and convents, a few dozen lost buildings might not seem calamitous.\n\nBut the number is significant enough to worry some city officials and other watchdog groups.\n\nGale A. Brewer, the Manhattan Borough President, for one, has compiled a list of nearly 200 properties that could be vulnerable, perhaps because they aren\u2019t as big as they could be under zoning laws, which means they have loads of unused development rights, or air rights, to sell. Staff members from Ms. Brewer\u2019s office have been paying visits to the properties to determine whether they are in harm\u2019s way.", "description": "Religious leaders ponder whether selling their buildings to developers is really the best way to protect their congregations.", "authors": ["C.
