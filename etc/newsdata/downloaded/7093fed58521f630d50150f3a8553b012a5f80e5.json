Saudi Turmoil To Boost Oil", "language": "en", "text": "Join Investing.com senior analysts Jesse Cohen and Clement Thibault as they review the most significant events to rock financial markets last week and discuss what's in store for the week ahead.\n\nThe format is simple: the two spend three minutes talking about each topic; a bell sounds when time is up, whereupon they move to the next topic.\n\nYou can listen to this week's episode on Spotify here: https://open.spotify.com/episode/616D7nowi4BIh9A1lVBM7N\n\nThe episode starts with: thoughts on another gripping week on Wall Street, where U.S. stocks enjoyed their third straight weekly gain amid easing trade tension between the U.S. and China (01:30-05:30).\n\nNext up: the analysts weigh in on the European Central Bank\u2019s decision last week to restart quantitative easing (QE) and cut its deeper into negative territory in a bid to revive the euro zone\u2019s faltering economy (05:30-10:05).\n\nFinally, the pair address the troubles facing the potential WeWork IPO, which saw its valuation cut to as low as $10 billion from $47 billion due to softer than expected demand (10:05-14:40).\n\nTurning their attention to the week ahead, the duo provides thoughts on how markets are likely to perform in the coming days and whether we\u2019re setting up for more record highs on Wall Street (14:40-18:45).\n\nThey also share what to expect from the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting, which kicks off on Tuesday, with a 25 basis point likely to be announced on Wednesday (18:45-23:30).\n\nFinally, focus turns to the market, where prices are expected to spike after an attack on Saudi oil facilities over the weekend knocked out more than half of the Kingdom\u2019s oil output (23:30-28:40).\n\nTo close the episode, each analyst provides their stock of the week: Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) for Clement (28:40-30:45) and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ) for Jesse (30:45-32:45).\n\nFind us on Twitter for feedback @Investingcom, @BellRingersPod, @JesseCohenInv, and @ClemThibault!\n\nDisclaimer: At the time of writing, neither Jesse nor Clement own shares in any of the companies mentioned.
