The owner of usually really dark brown hair and a center part closed Burberry\u2019s spring 2020 show during London Fashion Week looking kind of different in that she had lighter, sandy-blonde hair and a center part.\n\nThanks to the highly publicized runway show and a few up-close Instagram stories and selfies on Jenner\u2019s personal account, people quickly took notice of the new look and had a few hard-hitting questions about the change. Namely, is it a wig? Or is it her actual hair, just dyed blonde? Also, is she having more fun? But that last one is more of a rhetorical question because she clearly looks like she\u2019s having a lot of fun.\n\nKendall Jenner at Tyler, The Creator concert at Brixton Academy in London Sep. 16, 2019. pic.twitter.com/hsgVYPW1y0 \u2014 kendallnicole.style (@KendallNStyle) September 17, 2019\n\nJenner\u2019s fellow famous model friend Bella Hadid also went blonde before New York Fashion Week, so maybe this lightening and its timing speak to a bigger trend we\u2019ll be experiencing throughout the remainder of Fashion Month in Milan and Paris. In the meantime, I eagerly await a group picture of model friends Kendall, Gigi, Bella, and Hailey all together with their blonde hair looking all blonde and model-y.\n\nKendall Jenner closing the Burberry spring 2020 show with blonde hair.
