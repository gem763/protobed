Did it go well? No. No it did not. Not at all,' the Guardians Of The Galaxy star wrote. 'To quote Rocky Balboa, \"It\u2019s not how many times you get knocked down, it\u2019s how many times you get up... and keep moving forward.\"\n\n'As you can tell from the lump of coal in the center of the plate, this bagel bite never stood a chance,' he added.\n\n'I honestly simply cannot imagine what went wrong here. Pretty simple. Microwave. 2 minutes. Maybe she thought it said 2 hours. But I want to commend her for her effort. This is a big step babe. Proud of you.'\n\nKatherine, 29, didn't seem to be bothered by the post at all.\n\nPlayful or patronizing? In his caption, the actor mocked Katherine's inability to cook while pointing out how easy it is to make a Bagel Bite\n\nLaughing: Katherine, 29, didn't seem to take offense, and she even joked that the charred snack was all part of her plan to get Chris to do the cooking from now on\n\n'Smh': Katherine's younger brother Patrick said he was shaking his head over the situation\n\nThink about it: Many people thought the post was funny, but one Instagram user insisted it was misogynistic\n\nIn agreement: While some were quick to jump to the actor's defense, others agreed with the Instagram user's assessment of the situation\n\nOpinion: Someone else said the Guardians of the Galaxy star is 'condescending'\n\nJust wondering: One woman asked if publicly shaming his wife works for him\n\n'Looks like my plan to just have you do the cooking is working out very well,' she joked while her younger brother Patrick commented: 'Smh.'\n\nMany of Chris' followers thought the post was funny, and it prompted them to share their own stories in the comments section.\n\nSome people admitted that they initially though the charred snack was seared fish, while others were stunned that she made just one Bagel Bite.\n\nHowever, there were those who thought Chris was out of line for calling out his wife in the mocking post.\n\n'Ladies, this is the kind of posts that happen when you marry a misogynist,' one person wrote. '@prattprattpratt May hide it pretty well, but the misogyny rings loud and clear through the sarcasm... may think you\u2019re trying to be funny at her expense. Real comedy is not made at the expense of others.'\n\n'I knew he was trash': A tweet linking to a story about Chris making fun of his wife's cooking received similar criticism in the comments section\n\nWhile some were quick to jump to the actor's defense, others agreed with the Instagram user's assessment of the situation.\n\n'I completely agree with you. He\u2019s condescending,' someone commented. 'Of course she goes along with it because deep down she knows she\u2019s replaceable. This guy plays on her insecurity.'\n\n'I read it all as condescending, laced with humour, not great at all,' another agreed.\n\nA tweet linking to a story about Chris making fun of his wife's cooking received similar criticism in the comments section.\n\n'One day you should give it a shot, Worst Chris,' one person tweeted.\n\n'Make your own damn bagel bites, @prattprattpratt. You\u2019re 40,' someone else wrote.\n\nAnother Twitter user commented: 'Happy to be a lesbian.'", "description": "Chris, 40, took to Instagram over the weekend to share a photo of a burned Bagel Bite along with a mocking caption about Katherine's inability\u00a0to cook.", "authors": ["Erica Tempesta For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20013926-0-image-a-32_1571703386113.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
