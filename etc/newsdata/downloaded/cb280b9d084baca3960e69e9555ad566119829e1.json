But she suffered a stoke just one day into her sentence and a judge suspended the jail term.\n\nShe was later found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court of breaching a restraining order which had forbidden her having any contact with them.\n\nNeighbours filmed her attacking an electrician who came to work on a neighbouring house\n\nThe court hearings previously hear how Rankine ran a small business designing tea-related pottery and utensils from the house.\n\nShe wanted to run a tea room from the property, but suspicious neighbours feared it was more like a front for a brothel after the application stated that tearoom users were 'by appointment only' and would have booked time slots of two and a half hours.\n\nAfter the house was put on the market this week, one neighbour said: 'She's blighted this area for about 10 years now. It has been absolute hell living near her.\n\n'We are overjoyed she is moving out. I think there will be a lot of people celebrating when she's finally gone. I just feel for the people who she ends up moving in next to.'\n\nResidents have accused Rankine of sitting on her roof watching them in their gardens, playing loud music, holding late night parties in her outdoor swimming pool and dumping rubbish on their properties.\n\nIn 2017, Rankine was found guilty of attacking her neighbours Caroline Moore, Michelle Kavanagh (pictured together) and Brendan Kavanagh.\n\nThe five-bedroom house is now on the market for just under \u00a31million, to residents' delight\n\nAnother neighbour added: 'She has tormented us. It's been hellish. I think there will be a big party when she finally goes.'\n\nThe detached house features five bedrooms - one with a balcony, two reception rooms, a cellar playroom, wet room entertaining and games room, self contained annexe, large garden and heated outdoor swimming pool.\n\nEstate agents Quantrills say on RightMove: 'This is a very impressive double-fronted period family residence, occupying a mature setting in this sought-after and convenient residential location opposite Sutton Park.\n\n'Most attractive in appearance with classic double fronted elevations, the property stands well back from the road behind a deep foregarden with gated driveway providing extensive parking for up to 12 cars.\n\n'The spaciously arranged elegantly proportioned family accommodation retains many of its delightful features.'\n\nResidents expressed their joy that Rankine is moving out after the house went on the market", "description": "Julie Rankine, 56, has repeatedly harassed and abused her neighbours in Sutton Coldfield for almost a decade - hitting one with a walking stick and threatening another with an axe.", "authors": ["Richard Spillett", "Crime Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20027508-0-image-a-9_1571736022884.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
