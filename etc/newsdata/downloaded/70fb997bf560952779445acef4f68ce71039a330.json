Four more years of the Trump presidency could allow him to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. It would worsen the climate crisis. It could cement his paranoid racism and scorn for democracy as the new American normal.\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nGiven these consequences, you would think that Democrats would be approaching the 2020 campaign with a ruthless sense of purpose. But they\u2019re not, at least not yet. They are not focusing on issues that expose Trump\u2019s many vulnerabilities. They have instead devoted substantial time to wonky subjects that excite some progressive activists \u2014 and alienate most American voters. Recent polls suggest that the Democrats really are increasing the chances Trump will win re-election.\n\nThe good news is that the campaign is still just getting started. Many Americans haven\u2019t yet paid much attention. The next phase starts Thursday night, with a debate in Houston featuring the 10 leading candidates.\n\nIt\u2019s a chance for Democrats to start treating the 2020 campaign with the urgency it deserves.\n\nBefore I get into the polling, I want to make clear that I\u2019m not making the argument that some centrists and conservatives have made. By now, you\u2019ve probably heard claims that Democrats are hurtling toward socialism and instead must return to the triangulation of the Bill Clinton years. The evidence doesn\u2019t support that view.\n\nOver the past two decades, incomes for most Americans have barely grown. Median wealth has declined. Americans are frustrated, and a majority supports a populist agenda: higher taxes on corporations and the rich, expanded government health care and financial aid, a higher minimum wage, even a Green New Deal.\n\nThe Democrats are on solid ground, substantively and politically, by pushing all of these issues. They should be casting Trump as a plutocrat in populist\u2019s clothes, who has used the presidency to enrich himself and other wealthy insiders at the expense of hard-working middle-class families. It\u2019s a caricature that has the benefit of truth. When pundits yearn for economic triangulation, they\u2019re the ones confusing their own policy preferences with good political advice.\n\nThe mistake that Democratic candidates have made is thinking that just because they should activate their progressive id on some issues, they should do so on all issues.\n\nThere are two main examples, both of which have received a lot of airtime during the presidential debates. The first is the idea of decriminalizing border crossings, so that the illegal entry into this country would be only a civil violation. Most top Democratic candidates \u2014 Cory Booker, Juli\u00e1n Castro, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 support the idea. If illegal entry weren\u2019t a crime, they say, Trump couldn\u2019t lock people in cages.\n\nSupporters of the idea make intricate, technocratic arguments about how decriminalization won\u2019t make the border less secure. But most voters tune out. They don\u2019t buy the long explanations for why the policy doesn\u2019t mean what it certainly seems to mean: less border enforcement. In an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll, 67 percent of registered voters called decriminalization \u201ca bad idea.\u201d\n\nThe second example is a proposal to eliminate private health insurance and require people to have Medicare. Sanders and Warren back it. Again, supporters offer complex arguments about why Americans will love this idea (especially if it\u2019s phrased in just the right way) \u2014 and, again, most Americans say no thanks. They\u2019re dealing with enough economic anxiety, without having their health insurance taken away and replaced by something uncertain.\n\nThe shame is that both health care and immigration should be Democratic advantages. Most voters recoil at Trump\u2019s racist immigrant-bashing, and most want the option to join Medicare. And if Democrats want to reverse Trump\u2019s policies, they need to beat him, not offer policies, like decriminalization, that would hypothetically constrain him.\n\nYet Democrats are frittering away their advantage \u2014 and damaging their image. Last fall, most Americans had a favorable view of the Democratic Party, according to the Pew Research Center. That makes sense, because Democrats ran a populist campaign in the 2018 midterms, focused on pocketbook issues that dominate many people\u2019s lives, like wages and medical costs.\n\nThis year, the polling has flipped. Most Americans now have an unfavorable view of the party, no better than their view of the Republican Party. Likewise, slightly more voters say the \u201cideas being offered by the Democratic candidates\u201d would hurt the country than say would help, according to the NPR poll.\n\nI recognize that the subject of race looms over this discussion. By making the case for border decriminalization (as well as slavery reparations), Democrats are trying to signal their rejection of Trump\u2019s white nationalism. But there are ways to do that without pushing deeply unpopular policies. Several candidates instead seem to be advocating an agenda that liberals think black, Latino and Asian-American voters support, rather than the agenda that most actually support. More than 60 percent of voters of color, after all, say that border decriminalization is a bad idea.\n\nThe best strategy for Democrats is a populist one that speaks to voters of all races, the sort of campaign they ran last year and that Barack Obama ran in both 2008 and 2012. Those worked out pretty well.\n\nIn many fields \u2014 politics, business, the military, sports \u2014 successful leaders ask themselves what their opponent wants them to do, and then do the opposite. If Democrats at this week\u2019s debate keep talking about border decriminalization and mandatory Medicare, I know that many well-meaning liberals will be happy. But I can think of someone else who will also be happy: Donald Trump.\n\nListen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
