Piepenbring spent three months with the singer, attending parties and a private screening of \u201cKung Fu Panda,\u201d before their time together was ended by Prince\u2019s deadly fentanyl overdose in April.\n\nPRINCE: 1958-2016\n\nWhile learning about Prince firsthand at his Paisley Park complex in Minnesota, Piepenbring realized how much material he had to work with.\n\n\u201cThe sheer quantity of paper was surprising,\u201d Piepenbring tells the Guardian. \u201cThere was no real method to the madness. In one room you\u2019d find something from 1979, and within arm\u2019s reach, there\u2019d be something from 2002. There\u2019d be these moments of intense intentionality \u2014 he\u2019d gathered up all his handwritten lyrics from across his career, clipped them together and kept them in one place. Or he\u2019d gathered artifacts pertaining to his father\u2019s jazz band. It seemed very ad hoc and very personal.\u201d\n\nPRINCE'S ESTATE SLAMS TRUMP CAMPAIGN AFTER 'PURPLE RAIN' PLAYS AT MINNEAPOLIS RALLY\n\nPiepenbring picked up on tidbits about the secretive singer during the time spent with him, such as experiencing his great driving skills.
