Olivia Benson.\n\n\u201cAs [Benson] became lieutenant and I started thinking about who do I look up to, who is Olivia Benson\u2019s inspiration, [Ginsburg] is about as superhero as they come,\u201d Hargitay said.\n\n\u201cI watched that movie [RBG] and it changed my life. I could watch that movie on a loop,\u201d she added, referencing a 2018 documentary about Ginsburg. \u201cSo whenever I want to say \u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 I say, \u2018Actually, I can.\u2019\u201d\n\nHargitay has played Benson since Law & Order: SVU\u2019s premiere in 1999. She appeared on the debut episode of The Law & Order: SVU Podcast featuring host Anthony Roman in September following the show\u2019s Season 21 premiere.\n\nHargitay had reunited for a Sunday dinner with her former co-star Christopher Meloni, who portrayed Det. Elliot Stabler, earlier in the month.\n\nOn Late Night, Hargitay also discussed how she once got fired from a Power Rangers movie.\n\n\u201cI think her name was Dulcea or Dulcinea. I was so excited because I was going to Australia to play this queen,\u201d the star recalled.\n\n\u201cI was there for November and then December and then we were getting close to Christmas, and they had me on hold a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cFinally around December 21st I said, \u2018Guys, this is great, but you kept me on hold too long. I gotta go. It\u2019s Christmas! I think that\u2019s only fair.\u2019 So I go home and January 3rd, I call them. I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m ready!\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018Sweetie, you\u2019re good. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 Mariska Hargitay is sharing the origin behind her Law & Order: SVU character\u2019s love of supreme court justice Ruth Bader", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
