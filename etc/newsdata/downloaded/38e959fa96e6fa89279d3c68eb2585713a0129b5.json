Live Like Nothing's Changed", "language": "en", "text": "Dear Dave,\n\nI\u2019ll be graduating from college in December, and I\u2019ll have a job waiting for me that pays $50,000 a year. This will bring our household income up to about $95,000. The problem is we\u2019ve got $18,000 in student loan debt, $2,500 in credit card debt, and $4,000 to pay in medical bills. We\u2019re living in an apartment right now, so how should we handle this income increase regarding our debt situation?\n\nMikayla\n\nDear Mikayla,\n\nCongratulations on your decision to get control of your finances and your degree! If you two just keep living the way you have been, minus the debt, and put the rest toward the debt you\u2019ve incurred, you could be debt-free in a year or so.\n\nRemember, just because you\u2019ve got a lot more money coming in doesn\u2019t mean you should double your entertainment budget, take an expensive vacation, or run out and buy a new car. The first thing I\u2019d recommend is sitting down together, and working out a written, monthly budget. Give every dollar a name and a job to do before the coming month begins.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the debt snowball, either! List all your debts from smallest to largest, and attack the smallest\u2014that credit card debt\u2014first with a vengeance, while making minimum payments on the medical bills and student loan debt. Once you\u2019ve paid off the credit card debt, roll the money from that payment over and apply it, plus any other cash you can scrape together, toward the medical bills. Once the medical bills are out of the way, repeat the process and roll the payments over again targeting the student loan debt. At this point, you should have a bunch of cash to throw at those student loans each month until all that debt is off your backs once and for all.\n\nI\u2019m really proud of you two, Mikayla. If you\u2019ll follow my plan from here on out, you\u2019ll gain control of your money and be set to start saving and building real wealth!\n\n\u2014Dave", "description": "Dear Dave,I\u2019ll be graduating from college in December, and I\u2019ll .09/06/2019 8:07:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Dave Ramsey", "Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/263/4cfbe54d-23cb-414c-9afd-fc2d9a2dfa99.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
