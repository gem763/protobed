Carson also \u201clamented that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women,\u201d during a visit to San Francisco this week, the Post reported, citing agency staffers.\n\nA senior HUD official disputed the account in a statement to the Post.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary does not use derogatory language to refer to transgendered individuals. Any reporting to the contrary is false,\u201d the official said.\n\nCarson's department earlier this year signaled that it would propose a rule to allow HUD-subsidized homeless shelters to consider a person\u2019s sex or gender identification in determining whether they can be admitted.\n\nThis article tagged under: HUD\n\nBen Carson\n\nTransgender", "description": "\u201cBen Carson has spent his career in politics expressing disgust toward the existence of transgender people,\u201d the Human Rights Campaign president said.", "authors": ["Katy O'Donnell"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bf/f1/fcab819c45318a605ca07f821812/190920-ben-carson-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
