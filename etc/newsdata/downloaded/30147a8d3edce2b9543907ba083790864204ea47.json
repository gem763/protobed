Nathan Lyon, the bungling henchman to his superhero at Headingley, got one to dip into the pads, rag past the outside edge and kiss the top of off stump.\n\nIt was a beautiful piece of spin bowling. But when a drowsy Oval crowd offered Stokes the polite applause that a score of 67 might usually merit, a chance to thank the all-rounder for his efforts during this epic home season felt slightly missed.\n\nStokes, unable to bowl in this Test and thus with just fielding left on the to-do list, has hit a new level as a batsman this year; the responsibility that some feared may be shackling his game before the World Cup has paid out some serious jackpots since.\n\nJoe Denly misses out on century but steers England to dominant position Read more\n\nBecause beyond the miracles witnessed in the World Cup final and on that remarkable final day in Leeds, the once undulating Stokes has proved the most reliable player in this flaky England lineup. He averages 48 in Test cricket this year \u2013 next best, somehow, is Jack Leach on 35 \u2013 and has faced 90 balls per dismissal.\n\nThis latest display of controlled dominance came on a slightly subdued day in south London that was in keeping with the week overall. While they have not exactly been wearing own-clothes, watching a mildly educational film or negotiating a quiz set by the teacher, there has been an end-of-term feel to proceedings.\n\nThe teams have achieved their primary objectives \u2013 a first 50-over World Cup for England\u2019s men, a first Ashes retention by Australia\u2019s since 2001 \u2013 and came into the match looking a bit bedraggled. Both captains were unkempt a day out from the start, saying all the right things through glazed expressions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Stokes walks off after his dismissal.

The sky was clear, the sun shining and the air crisp \u2013 ideal conditions, one would think, for focused minds. The old stump microphones told us otherwise, however.\n\nIn the morning we heard Steve Smith explaining to Joe Denly how \u201cit\u2019s an easy game when there\u2019s no pressure on\u201d \u2013 hardly a confidence booster for leggy bowlers \u2013 while Matthew Wade was shovelling some more of his Tasmanian own-brand verbal compost at Joe Root, who replied with \u201cyou can\u2019t have it all your own way\u201d, before the umpires stepped in for a word of their own.\n\nAs the players walked off for lunch, Stokes was heard calling David Warner \u201ca fucking prick\u201d. The other end of the break, as the two teams trudged back out, Sky\u2019s outgoing and usually urbane David Gower let slip the words \u201cI haven\u2019t got a fucking clue,\u201d with the microphone still on.\n\nAshes 2019: England v Australia, fifth Test day three \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nYet to get off the mark at this stage, and soon dropped by Smith at slip off the bowling of Lyon, Stokes spent a small portion of the afternoon session being called \u201cBristol\u201d by Australia\u2019s close fielders. The afternoon\u2019s football fixtures did show Stoke hosting Bristol City, but we\u2019re probably entering \u201cSmith was impersonating Chris Rogers not Jack Leach\u201d territory here.\n\nStokes remains pretty impenetrable on the subject of his late-night altercation in 2017 though \u2013 one that similarly came at the end of a gruelling season \u2013 and as the session wore on he imposed himself on Australia\u2019s bowlers. Lyon got to re-live some of the highlights in Leeds, while a Marnus Labuschagne full toss was pumped over the rope for an 89-ball half-century.\n\nThe end, after tea, came with England fully in charge. Stokes, while disappointed that a chance for a third century this summer was gone, should be hugely satisfied.\n\nHis language may remain industrial but the end-of-term report shows As for attainment and diligence, something that may make his old teachers at Cockermouth School smile.", "description": "England are firmly in charge of the final Ashes Test against Australia but, apart from odd instances of feral behaviour, it all felt a bit subdued at the Oval", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b8d583fe48a30753e6994e10f2928fc006dc05d/160_103_3340_2005/master/3340.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a6b719dd6a4aa62ec3e42d4c4dd85ab3", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
