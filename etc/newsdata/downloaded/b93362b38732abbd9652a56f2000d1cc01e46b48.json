When I do not play, I don\u2019t enjoy myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have learnt a lot in these two years at Real Madrid, but now I am enjoying [my football].\n\n\u2018I knew that it was an important year, the coach [for Spain, Robert Moreno] has doubts and the one who doesn\u2019t play isn\u2019t going to be called up; it was a good time to go out on loan. With [Unai] Emery\u2019s confidence, I may have a chance of going to the Euros.\u2019\n\nOn whether he wants to return to Real, he stated firmly: \u2018I never thought of leaving permanently. My goal is to succeed at Real Madrid. I\u2019m going to fight to fulfil my dream.\u2019\n\nCeballos was full of praise for Emery and Arsenal but still wants to return to Real (Picture: Getty)\n\nHe continued: \u2018A player is not happy if he doesn\u2019t play, but when he feels important and does, then he is happy.\n\n\u2018Obviously I have been at Real Madrid, I have learnt from the best and I have won trophies, but it is easier when you play matches. I\u2019m happy and I feel important [at Arsenal], with room for improvement to play at the Euros next year.\u2019", "description": "Dani Ceballos says he is not considering leaving Real Madrid permanently and remains determined to establish himself with the Spanish giants once his Arsenal loan is over.
