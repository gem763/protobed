But he is now required to stand down by 2021 because of City governance rules.\n\nThe 67-year-old steered the group through a period of phenomenal growth and change which saw the departure of the controversial and high-flying chief executive Tidjane Thiam. It has culminated in the split of Britain's biggest and most emblematic name in insurance into two companies.\n\nPaul Manduca is required to stand down by 2021 because of governance rules\n\nIf everything goes to plan, shareholders in the Prudential, the fast-growing Asian and North American part of the business, will receive new shares in the domestic and European arm M&G on October 21.\n\nThe international arm, based at Angel Court in the heart of the City, will retain the Prudential name and is expected to have a stock market value in excess of \u00a330billion, putting it among the elite of global insurers.\n\nThe Pru will continue to be run by Canadian chief executive Mike Wells, who was drafted in by Manduca from the firm's North American arm Jackson National Life.\n\nOne of Manduca's most delicate tasks during his tenure was orchestrating a smooth transition from the leadership of Thiam to Wells.\n\nIn 2013, Thiam became one of the highest-profile chief executives to be personally censured by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, after an investigation into the insurer's ill-fated bid for Far Eastern competitor AIA in 2010.\n\nThe Pru was also fined \u00a330million by the FCA for failing to be 'open' and 'co-operative' with the watchdog over the proposed \u00a321billion takeover \u2013 which the FSA found out about through the media.\n\nThe stain on the Pru's reputation made Thiam's departure inevitable, although he quickly landed a top job as boss of Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse.\n\nManduca, who is marrried with two sons, made a pledge to the rest of the board and shareholders that he would remain as chairman until he had seen through the division of the company into two separate enterprises.\n\nM&G is expected to have a stock market valuation of up to \u00a38billion and will include the retail M&G brand as well as the group's strong book of annuities and huge legacy Pru life funds, built up over more than a century.\n\nJohn Foley is already in place as chief executive of M&G and will work with Mark Evans, a separate chairman who previously headed the board of beleaguered investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nUnder the City's governance code, FTSE board chairmen are required to step down after nine years. Manduca's period at the top has another 17 months to run, although it is understood he has already had approaches from other blue chip firms.", "description": "Paul Manduca joined the Prudential's board in 2010 and stepped up to be chairman in 2012.
