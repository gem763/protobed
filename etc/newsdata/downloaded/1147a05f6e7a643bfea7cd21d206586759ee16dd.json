(Photo: Capt Cash)\n\nLast week, we launched our annual Halloween costume show, and invited you to start sharing your plans for what you\u2019re going to be dressed up as this spooky season. Turns out, being a bunch of lovely nerds, some of you already came alarmingly prepared. We\u2019re here for it.\n\nBut even if you\u2019re still working on your own costume, or haven\u2019t even started thinking about it yet, you\u2019ve still got time to share your plans with us.\n\nEvery Friday in the run up to the big day itself, we\u2019ll be running check-in posts where you can have the chance to show us your costume or tell us what you\u2019re working on... including the post you\u2019re reading right now!\n\nStill looking for inspiration? We\u2019ve already had some lovely entries this year, like Capt Cash and his son above, who make for an absolutely adorable take on Avengers: Endgame\u2019s Iron Man and Iron Spider. Dwight D. Schrutenhower gave us this great mashup from Halloweens past with this fantastic Strong Bad/Bane crossover:\n\nMeanwhile Crosis101 shared a quartet of costumes, all of which were lovely, but we\u2019re very big fans of his Rebel Alliance pilot suit:\n\nWhat can we say? We love an X-Wing pilot here.", "description": "Last week, we launched our annual Halloween costume show, and invited you to start sharing your plans for what you\u2019re going to be dressed up as this spooky season.
