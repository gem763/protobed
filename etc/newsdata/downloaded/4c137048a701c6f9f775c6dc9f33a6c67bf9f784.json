Climate Summit", "language": "en", "text": "World leaders are set to convene at the United Nations to discuss the next steps in the global effort to slow the warming of the planet.\n\nMonday\u2019s climate summit is designed to generate momentum around meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris accord, which aims to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nDelegates aren\u2019t expected to hammer out new agreements during the one-day event. Instead, more than 60 countries, as well as business leaders and other government officials, are set to outline the measures they are taking to combat climate change. Key topics include phasing out coal and becoming carbon neutral by midcentury.\n\nThe U.S., which has vowed to leave the climate pact, isn\u2019t slated to take the stage Monday. Among those scheduled to speak are Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nThe summit follows youth climate strikes across the globe Friday, and is accompanied by a series of industry and investor events throughout the week that are focused on adopting more-sustainable business practices.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that we are not moving fast enough and we need to accelerate, and so we are here to push, push, push, push,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters Friday.\n\nThe average global temperature already is 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to World Meteorological Organization estimates.\n\nRelated Video At the U.N General Assembly, Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro plans to address concerns about deforestation, the Amazon fires and economic development in his country.

Janet Mills, who recently signed a bill into law targeting an 80% reduction in the state\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050, is on tap to talk. The U.N. has invited several local and regional officials tackling climate change around the world, to demonstrate that action is happening at all levels.\n\n\u201cPeople can only speak if they come with positive steps, so there is a kind of a ticket,\u201d Mr. Guterres said. \u201cFor bad news, don\u2019t come.\u201d\n\nEscalating tensions in the Middle East following strikes earlier this month that hobbled top Saudi Arabian oil facilities, as well as trade conflicts between the U.S. and China, are expected to loom large over the event, which precedes the start of general debate at the annual U.N. General Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing simultaneously global warming and global political warming, and the two things are combined and making our life more difficult,\u201d Mr. Guterres said.\n\n\u2014Emre Peker contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Elliott at rebecca.elliott@wsj.com", "description": "World leaders are set to convene at the United Nations to discuss the next steps in the global effort to slow the warming of the planet.", "authors": ["Rebecca Elliott", "Rebecca.Elliott Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109789/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
