None of the protesters\u2019 five demands is secession or independence.\n\nThe basketball furore also comes against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war, which escalated after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials on Tuesday.\n\nThe Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily newspaper, accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with arrogant disregard.\n\nMen walk past a poster at an NBA exhibition in Beijing, China October 8, 2019. REUTERS/Jason Lee/Files\n\n\u201cTweeting something offensive to the Chinese people before a series of NBA promotional activities in China only shows a lack of intellect, respect, and responsibility,\u201d it said.\n\nIn a separate report, the newspaper also said that some Chinese internet users had made \u201cdisrespectful comments\u201d about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201c(It) should remind Western media that for Chinese people, the Hong Kong riots are just like the 9/11, which is horrible and can\u2019t be justified,\u201d the Global Times said.\n\nNo one has been killed in several months of protests in Hong Kong, although scores - mostly protesters and journalists - have been hurt. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks killed 2,996 people and led to the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nEVENTS CANCELLED\n\nBasketball is the most popular sport in China, with about 300 million people playing the game. The NBA has deals with TV and digital media outlets across the country, and teams have played exhibition games annually since 2014.\n\nNBA China, launched in 2008 to run the league\u2019s business, is now worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nThe fallout from the Morey\u2019s tweet continued on Wednesday.\n\nThe NBA had planned to stage media events in Shanghai this week ahead of a preseason exhibition game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday.\n\nOrganisers cancelled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday afternoon, as well as an open training session with the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday, though a \u201cfans\u2019 night\u201d was still on despite a boycott by Chinese celebrities.\n\nState television has already halted plans to air exhibition games played in China this week, saying a country\u2019s sovereignty and social stability were \u201cnot within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nChinese online travel agency Ctrip (CTRP.O) said late on Tuesday it had stopped sales of tickets to NBA games as well as NBA-related tour packages, joining a growing list of companies severing ties with the league.\n\n\u201cCtrip firmly opposes any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability,\u201d it said on the social media platform Weibo, adding that it would suspend cooperation with the NBA.", "description": "Chinese state media on Wednesday accused the National Basketball Association (NBA) of endorsing violence and peddling a \"secessionist pipe dream\" in an escalating row over comments by a team official in support of protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["David Stanway", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438697603&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9806S", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
