Gov. Boyd Rutherford (R), filling in as board chair for Gov. Larry Hogan (R), described the vote as a \u201cjust and rightful close\u201d for the exonerees. It was the first time in 15 years that Maryland agreed to compensate any former prisoner for being wrongly convicted.\n\nIn states that have laws allowing compensation for exonerees, the average award is about $68,000 per year spent in prison, according to George Washington University law professor Jeffrey Gutman, who studies compensation for the wrongly convicted.\n\nBefore Wednesday\u2019s vote, Maryland\u2019s average compensation was about $47,000 for each year of incarceration. The state\u2019s process for allowing such payments has been slightly modified over the years to be less complex, but the General Assembly has failed to pass a law setting specific compensation amounts, and the Board of Public Works has been slow to act on petitions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Maryland law is very out of step,\u201d said Michelle Feldman, the state campaigns director at the New York-based Innocence Project.\n\nLomax, Lamar Johnson, Jerome Johnson, Clarence Shipley Jr. and Hubert James Williams filed their petitions over the past 20 months.\n\nThe men sought $100,000 a year for each year they were in prison. Several states, including Connecticut, Minnesota, New York and West Virginia, plus the District of Columbia, have paid an average well over that amount.\n\nMaryland agreed to pay the men a per-year sum of $78,916, a five-year average of the state\u2019s median income.\n\nMaryland Comptroller Peter Franchot (D) said the board used that formula because \u201cthese five men were deprived of the opportunity to have a household and the opportunity to gain an income and make contributions to their communities and to our state.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said he hopes the General Assembly will adopt a similar formula to apply to exonerees in the future.\n\nBefore the vote, Franchot, who is considering a 2022 run for governor, called the exonerees by name, saying they were \u201call victims of a broken criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nKopp described the compensation, which ranged from $903,560 for Hubert James Williams to $3,026,840 to Lomax, as a \u201cvery small token of the heartfelt apologies of the state and all of our citizens.\u201d\n\nNone of the men or their attorneys attended Wednesday\u2019s meeting.\n\nBut Lomax said in an interview that he was touched by Kopp\u2019s \u201cvery heartfelt\u201d words and the acknowledgment by Franchot that \u201csomething needed to be done.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEven before his release in 2006, Lomax started a parole reform initiative for inmates and former inmates \u2014 the Lifers Coalition. He has built that effort into the Maryland Restorative Justice Initiative, where he serves as executive director.\n\nAD\n\nHe said the settlement will allow him for the first time in his life to put the 39 years of incarceration behind him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still connected to what happened to me in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI will finally be able to put this whole saga, this whole ordeal, behind me.\u201d\n\nLomax was convicted of killing a grocery store night manager in Baltimore in 1968. A judge later ruled his defense lawyer was ineffective and failed to offer evidence in court that could have proved Lomax was innocent.\n\nAD\n\nIn the interview, Lomax said he always personally felt vindicated \u201cbecause I knew I hadn\u2019t committed the crime . . . and the most important people in my life knew I was innocent.\u201d\n\nAmong them was his sister, Carolyn, who fought until she died in 2015 to see him receive justice, Lomax said. She lived long enough to see his verdict set aside and the granting of a \u201cwrit of actual innocence\u201d from the Baltimore City state\u2019s attorney in 2014. He said he is haunted that his sister did not witness Wednesday\u2019s vote.\n\nAD\n\nLomax lives in East Baltimore. He plans to use the money, which will be paid in installments through July 2021, to provide a better life for his family \u2014 two grown children, seven grandchildren and a growing coterie of great-grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEach generation since I\u2019ve been born have had to struggle to get by in life,\u201d Lomax said, adding that his sister suffered with no heat in her home while she juggled bills. He said he has talked with his daughter about creating generational wealth for his children and the future children in his family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving money away. I\u2019m talking about creating situations where [subsequent] generations won\u2019t have the struggle that we had,\u201d he said.\n\nLamar Johnson said he wants to launch a real estate business, purchasing homes, rehabilitating them and renting them. First purchase: a home for his mother.\n\nAD\n\nWilliams, who has struggled with substance abuse and had bouts of homelessness, will be able to use the money to find stable housing and treatment, his lawyers said.\n\nAD\n\nAsked this summer what compensation from the state would mean, Shipley said, his voice cracking: \u201cNot only would it help me, it would help my family. My family still lives in the projects, still struggling. It would do a lot for me.\u201d\n\nThe awards include an additional $10,000 for each man to use for counseling.", "description": "Walter Lomax: \u2018I will finally be able to put his whole saga, this whole ordeal, behind me.\u2019", "authors": ["Ovetta Wiggins", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/C3J_4DrJtqqZbaMszqD5xCj4gMk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TTZLVOGVQII6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
