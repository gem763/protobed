Rhimes will be involved as well, overseeing the development of the new podcasts.\n\nWhile Shondaland is known for its TV shows, it has already been moving into podcasting with Katie\u2019s Crib, a show about motherhood from actress Katie Lowes. (The announcement says new episodes of Katie\u2019s Crib will be part of the Shondaland Audio slate.)\n\nThis partnership seems particularly noteworthy since Rhimes helped to kick off the current wave of huge streaming deals for content creators when she signed with Netflix two years ago. There haven\u2019t been quite as many eyebrow-raising deals in the podcasting world \u2014 but the Obamas did sign with Spotify a few months ago.\n\n\u201cPodcasting continues to see tremendous growth and I\u2019m excited to partner with iHeartMedia as Shondaland expands its storytelling journey into this medium which has seemed to usher in a unique sense of boldness, intimacy and connection,\u201d Rhimes said in a statement. \u201cWith iHeartMedia we aim to share stories that are engaging, insightful, and reflect a robust world-view while staying true to the authentic storytelling voice that has become synonymous with Shondaland.\u201d\n\niHeartRadio\u2019s parent company iHeartMedia has also shown a growing interest in podcasting, most notably with the acquisition of HowStuffWorks last year. And it\u2019s also starting to play podcasts on its terrestrial radio stations.", "description": "Shondaland, the production company founded by \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes, has signed a deal to create a new slate of podcasts for iHeartRadio over the next three years.
