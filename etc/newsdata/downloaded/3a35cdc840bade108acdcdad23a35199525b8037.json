If he doesn\u2019t, Biden said, \u201cDonald Trump will leave Congress no choice but to initiate impeachment. It would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s remarks were his first extended comments about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate the business activities in Ukraine of Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nThe phone call came to light as part of a whistle-blower complaint from an unidentified intelligence official. Congressional Democrats have demanded a copy of the complaint, but the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused.\n\nBut shortly before Biden spoke, Trump tweeted that he would release a complete transcript on Wednesday of his July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy. Trump said nothing about releasing a related whistle-blower complaint from an unidentified intelligence official, despite Democrats\u2019 demands, but the whistle-blower then asked to testify before Congress, reigniting what Trump sought to defuse.\n\nRead More: Trump to Release Ukraine Call as Democrats Mull Impeachment\n\nThe Trump administration has also refused to comply with requests from the six congressional committees investigating various aspects of Trump\u2019s business and political dealings.\n\nThe mood among Democrats in Congress has also shifted significantly this week with more lawmakers coming out in favor of beginning impeachment proceedings, and on Tuesday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats that she will support a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump, after growing demands for action from lawmakers.\n\nBiden had long resisted calls for impeachment, but on Tuesday, he framed Trump\u2019s actions as a threat to national security that required a bipartisan response.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an abuse of power,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt undermines our national security. It violates that oath of office. And it strikes at the heart of the sworn responsibility the president has to put the national interest before his personal interest.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comments come as many of his top rivals for the Democratic nomination have already called for impeachment and as Biden has seen his front-runner status start to weaken. Two recent state polls in Iowa and New Hampshire show Elizabeth Warren narrowly leading Biden.\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s top rivals, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, didn\u2019t explicitly defend the Biden family when asked at an Iowa news conference on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI read what I read, but I don\u2019t know enough to say at this point to make any definitive statement,\u201d he said, when asked whether Hunter Biden should be off limits as a talking point for Democratic candidates on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump\u2019s allegation, unsupported by evidence, is that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general in 2016 in order to stop an investigation Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served as a director.\n\nBiden, as vice president, did demand that Ukraine oust its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, for corruption. And he later said he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees from Ukraine unless its leaders dismissed Shokin. The Ukrainian parliament wound up voting to remove the prosecutor.\n\nBut Shokin\u2019s top deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, told Bloomberg News that the investigation into Burisma Holdings had been dormant for more than a year before Biden addressed corruption issues with Ukraine\u2018s president. The European Union and Ukraine\u2019s creditors also sought Shokin\u2019s dismissal.\n\n(Updates with details, quotes throughout.)\n\n--With assistance from Emma Kinery.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tyler Pager in Wilmington, Delaware at tpager1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Wendy Benjaminson at wbenjaminson@bloomberg.net, Max Berley\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday he would back impeaching President Donald Trump if the White House refuses to comply with congressional demands for information about his interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president and other Democratic probes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAHMvRQ.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1556&y=497"}
