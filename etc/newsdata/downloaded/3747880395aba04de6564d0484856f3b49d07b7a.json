Thunberg chastised leaders for praising young activists like herself while failing to deliver on drastic actions needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change, and she warned that if the world continued with business as usual, her generation would face an insurmountable catastrophe.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong,\u201d said Thunberg, who was visibly emotional as she spoke on a panel at a U.N. climate summit Monday. With tears in her eyes and her face flushed, the 16-year-old activist \u2014 who began skipping school in her native Sweden a year ago to protest inaction on climate change \u2014 chastised the world leaders who had gathered in New York.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\u201d said Thunberg, who traveled for two weeks on a solar-powered sailboat to reach the United States this month. \u201cYet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?\u201d\n\nThunberg has quickly become the face of a global movement of young people demanding that their elders safeguard their planet\u2019s future. On Friday, millions of young people all over the world joined Thunberg in a climate strike that she led from New York.\n\n[\u2018We will make them hear us\u2019: Millions of youths around the world strike for action]\n\nThunberg continued her campaign Monday, as she and 15 other young people filed a legal complaint with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child arguing that major countries \u2014 Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey \u2014 have known about the risks of climate change for decades but have failed to take sufficient action to curb their emissions. The petitioners range in age from 8 to 17 and hail from Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Palau, the Marshall Islands, Nigeria, South Africa, Sweden, Tunisia and the United States.\n\n\u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d Thunberg said as she sat on the dais with panelists who included a young clean-energy entrepreneur from India and a Brazilian lawyer representing youth climate activists. \u201cPeople are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystem are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear,\u201d Thunberg added. \u201cHow dare you continue to look away and come here and say you\u2019re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight? You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency, but no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that, because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil, and that I refuse to believe.\"\n\nHer remarks ended with a warning: \u201cYou\u2019re failing us, but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say, we will never forgive you.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to respond to Thunberg less than an hour later when he addressed the gathering in French and called on his fellow leaders to take more ambitious action given the urgency of the climate threat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the emotion this morning,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nTeen climate activist Greta Thunberg demands that Congress \u2018listen to the scientists\u2019", "description": "The teenage climate activist had one question for the global leaders assembled at the United Nations: \u201cHow dare you?\u201d", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "September At Pm", "Kayla Epstein Is The Social Media Editor For National At The Washington Post.
