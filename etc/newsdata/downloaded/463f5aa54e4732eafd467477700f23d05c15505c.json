Get ready for more. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nThrough time these past 150 years, college football has presented weekends so jam-packed with enticements that we sick pups who follow it might spend an entire Saturday welded to a favored slab of furniture, remote in hand, helpless against a dangerous tide of sedentariness. The best we can hope for is an inadvertent freedom from gluten.\n\nOne such weekend pops up next, and it begins with the state of Texas alone. Not only will No. 6 Oklahoma (5-0) cross the line again to play No. 11 Texas (4-1) on Saturday at ungodly 11 a.m. in Dallas, and not only will the Texas State Fair present its innovative foods of arterial damage.\n\nNot only did Texas Coach Tom Herman just say to reporters in West Virginia after a 42-31 win there: \u201cWhen you play teams 60, 70, a hundred times, to me, that defines a rivalry. We don\u2019t play any less hard against West Virginia than we do anybody else on our schedule. Obviously the team we play next week is, by and large, our biggest rival.\u201d\n\nNot only did Oklahoma Coach Lincoln Riley just say to reporters in Kansas after a 45-20 win there: \u201cI like where our heads are at. I like this team. I do \u2026\u201d\n\nNo, the state of Texas also will stage the sound of No. 24 Texas A&M (3-2), its home den booming even more than usual with the presence of No. 1 Alabama (5-0).\n\nAnd as much as people do forget Waco, do not forget Waco, where one of the genuine human beings in the game, Matt Rhule, has become that rare native New Yorker to lead Baylor \u2014 Baylor! \u2014 from dire wreckage to 5-0 this year. The freshly ranked No. 22 Bears just recorded a daydream number of sacks (six) and tackles for loss (15) in their 31-12 win at Kansas State and are set to welcome Texas Tech (3-2), which just knocked off Oklahoma State.\n\n\u201cWe have a brotherhood like no other,\u201d nose tackle Bravvion Roy told reporters Saturday, and in a sport where seemingly every team spends this young century self-referencing as \u201cbrothers,\u201d that\u2019s serious brother brio.\n\nJust outside of Texas lies that team that ransacked Texas in Austin on Sept. 7, and what a time for No. 5 LSU (5-0) to welcome No. 7 Florida (6-0). Florida and \u201cThe Swamp\u201d just finished sending Auburn into a woozy state of disappearance, such that Auburn Coach Gus Malzahn\u2019s description of one false start \u2014 \u201cThe crowd got us, I guess\u201d \u2014 could have applied to the whole afternoon.\n\n[Florida reclaims The Swamp, and Auburn has no escape]\n\nNow Florida will take a turn as the team coping with unsympathetic noise, under the hazy lights of an LSU \u201cvalley\u201d which claims to offer \u201cdeath.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an LSU that throws the ball around expertly, making it an LSU-plus or a frightening LSU. Quarterback Joe Burrow has a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 22-3, and Justin Jefferson, Ja\u2019Marr Chase and Terrace Marshall Jr., already have caught 30, 23 and 20 passes for 547, 451 and 304 yards, and good grief on that. Further, the 42-6 win over Utah State Saturday shouldn\u2019t go dismissed as something blas\u00e9, what with Utah State conducting a very good program in general.\n\n\n\nJoe Burrow and LSU are rolling. (Chris Graythen/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI mean, we had 600 yards of offense and we\u2019re not very happy,\u201d Burrow told reporters in Louisiana. \u201cThat tells us where we can go \u2026 You know, 42-6, 600 yards of offense, you know, last year we would have been very happy about that. But this is a new team, a new offense, and things have changed around here when you\u2019re not happy about this performance.\u201d\n\nThen, with LSU\u2019s defense spending recent weeks mired in the pinpoint scrutiny that American college towns often offer leaky defenses, especially after allowing Vanderbilt 38 points in an alleged breach of the Ten Commandments, that undefeated yet embattled unit allowed Utah State 216 yards fewer than it had in any game this year (159, a feat even given Utah State\u2019s upgrade in opponent).\n\n\u201cI feel like as far as defense, we needed this,\u201d linebacker K\u2019Lavon Chaisson told reporters in a bizarre country. \u201cWe needed something to help establish, I feel like, to get our confidence back and get going.\u201d\n\nNow comes Florida.\n\nDinner!\n\n(Ordered in, of course.)\n\n[College football winners and losers: ACC, you so crazy]\n\nYet the docket bulges with so much else. Southern California (3-2) will visit No. 9 Notre Dame (4-1), with the very confluence of those two sets of uniforms always a feast, especially given all the cowering scheduling out there. A curious team from No. 10 Penn State (5-0) makes a curious visit to No. 17 Iowa (4-1, after its 10-3 strife at Michigan). No. 8 Wisconsin (5-0) will welcome Michigan State (4-2, after its 34-10 strife at mighty Ohio State).\n\nThen the really sick pups \u2014 hi \u2014 must cast glances at other places, maybe alongside other meals. If No. 20 Virginia (4-1) can win at Miami (2-3), that will make a two-week Virginian sweep of the home Hurricanes (following Virginia Tech\u2019s win), a prospect so alien to past American life that it suggests some sort of end of time. When South Carolina (2-3) plays at No. 3 Georgia (5-0), feelings always run deep even if Gamecock hopes do not. Nebraska (4-2) goes to the giddy story developing at Minnesota (5-0), whose Rodney Smith just rushed for 211 yards at Illinois. Florida State (3-2) might take a strafing at No. 2 Clemson (5-0), but that strafing figures to tell us some truths.\n\nAnd speaking of truths, Coach Sonny Dykes spoke a big one Saturday night. His second SMU team had trailed Tulsa 30-9 as the fourth quarter began. He had said of his 6-0 squad, \u201cI knew that our players, the buy-in was so much better Year 2 than it was Year 1.\u201d He had said, \u201cWe tell our guys all the time that confidence, really, is preparation.\u201d\n\nAnd as his fresh American Athletic Conference threat with a No. 21 ranking, its howling history, its death penalty tucked back in there, reveled in its 43-37, triple-overtime win, Dykes said: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever going to play for, or coach for, a championship football team, you\u2019ve got to win some games like this. That\u2019s just part of the road to a championship, winning some games that, you know, at some point in the game, you kind of think, \u2018Well, this is not going to go our way.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA thousand coaches and the current king, Clemson\u2019s Dabo Swinney, could tell you likewise. It\u2019s among the many reasons so many of us, knowing we suddenly might find ourselves gripped helplessly by an SMU-Tulsa game, commit to an autumn series of poor Saturday health choices. Anyway, SMU will not play this weekend, proving there\u2019s actually such a thing as too much.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy is service academy football so special?
