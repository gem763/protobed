The number of millionaires would also grow over this period to almost 63 million.\n\nThe share of the world's bottom 90% accounts for 18% of global wealth, compared to 11% in the 2000.\n\n\"While it is too early to say wealth inequality is now in a downward phase, the prevailing evidence suggests that 2016 may have been the peak for the near future,\" it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Ros Russell)", "description": "The number of rich Chinese has surpassed the count of wealthy Americans for the first time as both countries keep churning out millionaires, a study by Credit Suisse showed.", "authors": ["Michael Shields"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cf014.OYWK2Qf4tUjjemTg--~B/aD0zMzMzO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/17bb2cb0-f3df-11e9-afdf-842d14d0891a", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
