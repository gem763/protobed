Joaquin Phoenix's electric, disturbing performance is thus dogged by history and questions about the \"why\" of it all -- that is, a Joker without Batman -- an answer that isn't really in the cards.\n\nThere is a constituency eager to blame Hollywood for contributing to societal ills that includes plenty of dishonest brokers. That said, the Joker character and \"Taxi Driver\" both come with unwelcome asterisks -- the first in its association with the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Col., the latter in John Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt on President Reagan.\n\n\"Joker\" plunges back to that earlier era, focusing on a Gotham City that resembles a nightmare vision of New York circa the early 1980s, mixed with elements of the pre-Batman TV show \"Gotham.\" As for the title role, Phoenix's take owes an obvious debt to Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning role, while putting his own spin on an origin story that casts Joker, nee Arthur Fleck, as the kind of brooding loner who only garners attention via a link to tragedy.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips is best known for \"The Hangover\" trilogy, and has seemingly overcompensated for his comedy roots by delivering a movie virtually devoid of humor.\n\nWhile that's understandable given the context, the unrelenting gloom and prevailing sense of dread becomes almost oppressive, perhaps especially for those who aren't steeped in the mythology.
