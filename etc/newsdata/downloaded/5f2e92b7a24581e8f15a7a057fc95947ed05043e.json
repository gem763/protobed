The event is bankrolled by the Dialogue of Civilizations (DOC), a group founded by Vladimir Yakunin\u2014a sanctioned Russian billionaire and former KGB general who has served since the early 1990s as one of Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest confidants.\n\nYakunin\u2019s DOC has stood at the nexus of a number of groups and events that, as one German newspaper wrote, are intended to \u201cmake the Russian view of the world popular,\u201d all while acting as an \u201cinstrument of Moscow\u2019s hybrid warfare\u201d against Western countries. And the Rhodes Forum is the most prominent gathering within that portfolio of events, with the DOC describing it as the group\u2019s \u201cflagship public event.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Free Russia Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to highlighting the Kremlin\u2019s crimes, the two-day event is hardly an anodyne affair. Rather, it\u2019s an event \u201cnicknamed by Western intelligence professionals as a \u2018KGB team-building\u2019 exercise.\u201d As POLITICO added a few years ago, the Rhodes Forum is a chance for the \u201cPutin adoration society\u201d and \u201cKremlin sympathizers\u201d to gather and trade praise for Russia\u2019s kleptocracy.\n\nEvery year, the event manages to attract a number of Western statesmen and academics willing to travel to Greece, who don\u2019t seem to care that they\u2019re helping whitewash the reputation of a sanctioned oligarch like Yakunin along the way. And this year, the Rhodes Forum appeared to land its biggest coup in years. Earlier this year, the DOC announced that the keynote speaker at this year\u2019s forum would be James \u201cJamie\u201d Rubin, a former State Department official during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration who now works at the Ballard Partners lobbying shop.\n\nAt the time, the DOC described Rubin, who served as the spokesperson for former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, as an \u201cinternationally renowned foreign affairs journalist, academic, and world-leading authority on U.S. diplomatic, national security and foreign policy.\u201d More importantly, Rubin was an American. And landing him as a keynote speaker hinted at a potential for thaw between Moscow and Washington, with the eventual lifting of sanctions on Yakunin that much likelier as a result.\n\nAs of this month, though, Rubin announced that he\u2019s pulling out of the conference entirely\u2014both because he found out who Yakunin was, and because he didn\u2019t want anything to do with appearing to give legitimacy to Putin and his allies.\n\n\u201cAlthough I intended to speak my mind at the Rhodes event, including strong criticism of Russia\u2019s foreign policy steps that continue to undermine the international order, I certainly did not want to appear to give legitimacy to any of the individuals who have supported Russia\u2019s pernicious policies around the world,\u201d Rubin, who has been outspoken about the Kremlin\u2019s anti-American policies in the past, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201c The sanctioned oligarch has been linked to some of the most vociferously anti-LGBTQ groups extant. \u201d\n\nRubin\u2019s decision is a massive black eye for an event that has struggled to maintain relevance over the past few years. That decline in importance is due directly to the fact that numerous Western governments, including the U.S., Canada, and Australia, have sanctioned Yakunin directly for his role in Russia\u2019s kleptocracy. (The DOC did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s questions.)\n\nThe sanctions have been a continued blight on Yakunin\u2019s supposed reputation, which he has gone to perhaps greater lengths than any other sanctioned oligarch to maintain in the West. Indeed, thanks to PR shops and things like the Rhodes Forum, Quartz described Yakunin as the poster child of \u201creputation laundering\u201d among sanctioned Russian oligarchs.\n\nAnd that \u201creputation laundering\u201d does seem like it\u2019s had an effect. Some of the American academics involved in the DOC told this reporter last year that they didn\u2019t even know that Yakunin had been sanctioned by the U.S. Or as Rubin said when he was first told in July of Yakunin\u2019s involvement in the Rhodes Forum, \u201cWho the hell is Yakunin?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. Yakunin positions himself as some kind of apolitical philanthropist, interested simply in good governance and global stability. His DOC profile describes him as a \u201cRussian business leader and philanthropist.\u201d But that biography doesn\u2019t bother to mention anything about Yakunin\u2019s KGB background, or the fact that he rose to become a KGB general\u2014 outranking Putin himself, who only attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the KGB\u2014before the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.\n\nNor does his biography mention anything about his allegedly substantial wealth. The source of such wealth is unclear, but the former KGB general has, like all of those close to Putin since the early 1990s, been accused of rampant corruption.\n\nRenowned anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny has alleged that Yakunin accrued his wealth through ill-gotten means. As Navalny wrote in 2016, Yakunin\u2019s family had \u201cbuilt a huge business empire\u201d through \u201ccorruption and mismanagement,\u201d accruing a network of wealth \u201cworth billions of dollars.\u201d (Yakunin has denied the allegations, and his spokesperson did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s questions.)\n\nTo wit, a Reuters investigation in 2014 found that Russian Railways, at the time overseen by Yakunin, appeared to be involved in potentially massive money laundering. With Yakunin as its head, Russian Railways had \u201cpaid billions of dollars to private contractors that disguise their ultimate owners and have little or no presence at their registered headquarters.\u201d Little surprise, then, that Navalny also found that Yakunin\u2019s personal mansion had things like a storage room specifically devoted to his wife\u2019s fur coat collection\u2014not something generally associated with philanthropy.\n\nBut Yakunin isn\u2019t interested simply in laundering his image for Western audiences. The sanctioned oligarch has also been linked to some of the most vociferously anti-LGBTQ groups extant, including the notorious World Congress of Families (WCF), a joint Russian-American operation that has provided extensive links between sanctioned Russian oligarchs and America\u2019s fundamentalist Christian community. Numerous stories, and even WCF promotional materials, identified Yakunin as a sponsor of the WCF, which has promulgated some of the most anti-progressive and bigoted legislation across the world over the past decade.\n\nDespite the clear evidence, a representative for Yakunin previously denied to ThinkProgress that Yakunin has funded the WCF\u2014 even though his wife spoke at last year\u2019s WCF conference in Moldova.\n\nAs it is, Rubin\u2019s decision to pull out of the Rhodes Forum is the latest blow to Yakunin\u2019s efforts to maintain his image for Western audiences. It\u2019s also a sign that, despite his apparent efforts, the DOC\u2019s money can only go so far. Rubin previously told this reporter that he\u2019d been planning on charging the DOC a $15,000 fee for the speaking engagement. But that was before he found out who Yakunin was. \u201cIt was a close call,\u201d Rubin said, \u201cbut it seemed wiser not to let my presence at such an open event be misunderstood or misused in any way.\u201d", "description": "Now matter how much Vladimir Yakunin, a former KGB general and Putin buddy with billions of dubious dollars, tries to clean up his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it just won\u2019t wash.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569371583/190924-Michel-putin-clinton-crony-tease_ijffjt", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
