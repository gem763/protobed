You pick up your phone and murmur quietly, \u201cOK Google, when\u2019s my next appointment?\u201d And then, loud enough to be heard over the entire room, your Google Assistant announces, \u201cNext up, you have an appointment with your urologist on September 3rd at 9AM.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to hide under your desk anymore. Google has now made it possible to silence all Google Assistant voice output and only show the answers to your questions on your phone. Here\u2019s how to set it up:\n\nAccess your Google Assistant by either long-pressing on the home button or saying \u201cHey, Google\u201d or \u201cOK Google.\u201d\n\nTap the symbol on the lower right corner.\n\nTap your personal icon on the upper right corner.\n\nSelect \u201cSettings.\u201d\n\nSelect \u201cAssistant\u201d (on the top line).\n\nScroll down to \u201cAssistant devices\u201d and find either the word \u201cPhone\u201d or the name that you\u2019ve assigned your phone. Tap on it.\n\nScroll down to \u201cVoice and Speech\u201d and tap on \u201cSpeech output.\u201d\n\nSelect \u201cHands-free only.\u201d\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you\u2019re done! From here on, you can either type in or speak your requests to Google Assistant, and it will silently offer you whatever help it can provide.", "description": "Google has now made it possible to silence all Google Assistant voice output and only show the answers on your phone.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lM4aBHNVrbVnwPuooMaviVlSmvI=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10817651/acastro_180510_1777_google_assistant_0003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
