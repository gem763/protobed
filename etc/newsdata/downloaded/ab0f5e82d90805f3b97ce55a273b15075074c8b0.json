Photo: Jim Spellman/WireImage\n\nIt\u2019s the championship battle of the century. In one corner, fresh off The Irishman starring Robert De Niro, it\u2019s legendary director Martin Scorsese. And in this corner, Marvel Cinematic Universe mastermind Kevin Feige. Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! Scorsese has already kicked open the library doors, reading Marvel *ahem* \u201cfilms\u201d for filth in Empire magazine. \u201cHonestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks,\u201d he said, clouds pouring darkness over Marvel Studios. He\u2019s not too far off, what with Avengers Campus coming to Disney\u2019s California Adventure Park in 2020. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being,\u201d the director of The Irishman added, claiming he\u2019s tried to watch Marvel movies, \u201cbut that\u2019s not cinema.\u201d Before you get your Spider-Man undies in a twist, just remember: Martin Scorsese is 76, prefers Mob movies, and does not affect your life in any way. Go watch the small boy sling webs, if that\u2019s what you like. Unless you\u2019re Kevin Feige, in which case I would get your publicist on the phone right now \u2026 you have a lot to say about The Irishman, don\u2019t you?", "description": "Acclaimed filmmaker and director of \u2018The Irishman,\u2019 Martin Scorsese declared Marvel movies are simply \u201cnot cinema.\u201d", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-martin-scorcese.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
