Is he alive, or was he killed by police?\u201d asked one of the town elders, who asked that his name be withheld to protect his safety. \u201cWhat kind of country is this where one cannot speak freely?\n\n\u201cHe is not the first one to go missing,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are losing our people in mysterious ways.\u201d\n\nMr. Ndereyimana, 29, disappeared two months ago on his way to a youth meeting organized by United Democratic Forces of Rwanda (FDU-Inkingi), a coalition of small opposition parties that banded together to oppose Rwandan President Paul Kagame and his long-ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).\n\nMr. Ndereyimana was a vocal opponent of Mr. Kagame, who has been in power for nearly two decades. He was especially popular among the young.\n\nMr. Ndereyimana is the latest Rwandan opposition leader to disappear, be imprisoned or be killed. The country has been hailed abroad for its political and economic development since the genocide 25 years ago but has come under increasing criticism for human rights violations.\n\n\u201cOn the international stage, Rwanda is a model of law and order, yet we are seeing a spate of violent and brazen attacks against opposition members go unpunished,\u201d Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cRwanda\u2019s partners and donors should be raising questions about the fate of those who try to criticize the government or its policies. Otherwise, opponents or state critics will likely continue to end up dead or missing.\u201d\n\nMr. Kagame officially came to power in 2000 after commanding a rebel force that ended the 1994 Rwandan genocide by the majority Hutus targeting the minority Tutsis, a massacre that resulted in more than 800,000 deaths. From 1994 to 2000, he was considered the de facto leader as vice president and defense minister.\n\nRwanda has since rebuilt itself under the RPF party and earned a reputation as one of the continent\u2019s best-run countries. It has been hailed for its political stability and for tackling corruption while improving its education and technology sectors. Rwanda also has generated enviable economic growth rates for most of this century, reduced poverty, and increased literacy and life expectancy significantly, according to the World Bank. More women hold public office in Rwanda than anywhere else on the planet.\n\nStrict control\n\nTo achieve the stability needed for growth, Mr. Kagame\u2019s administration exerted strict control over the political landscape, analysts say, but it started to go too far in the past few years. Political activists challenging Mr. Kagame\u2019s authority have disappeared without a trace. Others have been violently attacked or jailed.\n\nOn Sept. 23, two men believed to be police officers stabbed to death Syridio Dusabumuremyi of the FDU-Inkingi party at his shop in the country\u2019s southern Muhanga district.\n\nIn March, FDU-Inkingi spokesman Anselme Mutuyimana was kidnapped and his body dumped in a forest in the country\u2019s west. Late last year, FDU-Inkingi First Vice President Boniface Twagirimana disappeared without a trace.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening in this country ,\u201d said Victoire Ingabire, leader of FDU-Inkingi. \u201cWe want the government to tell the country who is killing members of the opposition and who is responsible for those disappearances. We have many cases of unsolved murders and disappearances, but the government doesn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\n\nThe Rwanda Investigation Office used to conduct inquiries into killings and disappearances of officials, but no reports were issued for the recent cases.\n\n\u201cWe are aware and investigations are ongoing,\u201d Modeste Mbabazi, a spokesman for the office, said after Dusabumuremyi was stabbed to death. \u201cTwo people have already been arrested in connection with the murder.\u201d\n\nMr. Kagame denies having anything to do with the violence and disappearances.\n\nRwanda\u2019s European critics \u201creally need to stop this superiority complex nonsense about human rights,\u201d he told France 24 television in a recent interview in Brussels. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the only ones who respect human rights. No, we have fought for human rights and freedoms of our people much better and more than anyone \u2014 including you people who keep talking about this nonsense. Where we have taken a country and where it is now speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere on the street, meanwhile, has been tense. In the capital, Kigali, and other major cities across the country, most are afraid to speak openly about politics for fear of repercussions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak to you. I can get killed,\u201d said a mother of three who owns a grocery shop in Kigali. In her attempt to demonstrate that she wasn\u2019t speaking against Mr. Kagame\u2019s government, she said, \u201cAs a country, we are united under the good leadership of our beloved president, Kagame. He cares about us, and we love him very much.\u201d\n\nOthers, still wary of giving their names, are more critical and openly solicit outside help.\n\n\u201cThis is another genocide perpetuated by Kagame, and the world is unaware,\u201d said the elder at the bus stop. \u201cThe international community should come to our rescue. We are helpless.\u201d\n\nAlthough the political stability under Mr. Kagame\u2019s tough rule has helped spur economic development, analysts say, the lack of political freedoms and civil liberties will slow down long-term progress \u2014 especially the development of youths like Mr. Ndereyimana, who is widely seen as a prospective leader of the region or even the country.\n\nEdward Kisiang\u2019ani, a professor of political history at Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya, said Mr. Kagame has taken advantage of Rwanda\u2019s economic growth and his impressive development record to exert strict control over the political landscape and stamp out any challenge to his power.\n\n\u201cThe international community see Kagame as a savior, and he is not accountable to anyone because he saved his people,\u201d Mr. Kisiang\u2019ani said. \u201cRwanda needs democracy to have sustainable development. The country cannot develop if there\u2019s no space to criticize leaders because corruption and mismanagement of resources will become widespread.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
