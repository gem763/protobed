Elizabeth Warren\u2019s story about being fired early in her career because she was pregnant may sound like an artifact from a less enlightened era, but pregnancy discrimination is alive and well today.\n\nA conservative political website disputed Warren\u2019s claim recently after it found public meeting minutes that appeared to contradict Warren\u2019s account. The site also noted that Warren\u2019s story about leaving her teaching job has changed over the years. But Warren \u2014 a Democrat from Massachusetts who\u2019s vying for the Democratic nomination \u2014 stuck by her claim in an interview with CBS News. She then urged other women to share their stories of pregnancy discrimination on Twitter TWTR, +2.07%.\n\n\u201cThis was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination \u2014 but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIndeed, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act passed in 1978, but more than 40 years later, discrimination against pregnant workers is still \u201cincredibly common,\u201d said Alex Baptiste, policy counsel at the National Partnership for Women & Families. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission fielded more than 2,000 complaints of pregnancy discrimination in 2018.\n\n\u201cIt impacts people across industry, pay scale, race, ethnicity, background \u2014 it can happen in any work environment and in any state,\u201d Baptiste said.\n\nSome of the country\u2019s biggest employers, including Walmart and UPS, have run afoul of pregnancy discrimination laws, and a 2018 New York Times investigation explored its presence across sectors, from financial firms to factory floors.\n\nPregnancy discrimination can be as overt as an employer firing a worker when they find out she\u2019s pregnant, but it also includes less explicit forms of unfair treatment, like not letting a pregnant worker have a water bottle near her work area, Baptiste said. \u201cAll of these things have real consequences and affect a pregnant workers employment, earnings and opportunity,\u201d she added.\n\nThe changing demographics of the American workforce are one factor in the persistence of this type of discrimination. \u201cOver the last several years, as more women entered the workforce, and have moved into more occupations or industries that were previously male dominated, there\u2019s been an increase in denial of requests for accommodations for pregnant workers, and firing them for doing so,\u201d said Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality and senior counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, women are far more likely to work while they\u2019re pregnant than in decades past, and they tend to work until they are further along in their pregnancies, a 2015 Pew Research Center analysis found.\n\nThe NWLC filed a class-action lawsuit in 2017 against Walmart on behalf of pregnant workers, one of whom said the company denied her request to not lift heavy objects or climb ladders while pregnant. The EEOC filed a similar suit against the mega-retailer in 2018. Both suits are ongoing. Walmart WMT, +0.53% did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nThe EEOC has brought several pregnancy discrimination cases recently against employers:\n\n\u2022 UPS, which lost a pregnancy discrimination before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, paid a $2.25 million settlement in September to settle charges that it did not provide light duty accommodations to pregnant workers. A UPS spokesman told MarketWatch, \u201cUPS works closely with our female employees to make their work experience a positive one throughout their pregnancies, the births of their children, and caring for related medical conditions. Our maternity leave benefits have included paid time off and opportunities for light duty work assignments for several years.\u201d\n\n\u2022 EEOC sued Tacoma, Washington\u2019s Oatridge Security in September after a supervisor allegedly told a pregnant worker that working security \u201cwasn\u2019t proper\u201d for a pregnant woman. The company did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\n\u2022 Chain retailer Party City PRTY, +5.62% paid a $39,000 settlement in July after the company allegedly fired a Texas worker because she was pregnant. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvocates are now pushing for stronger protections for pregnant workers and want Congress to pass a new law called the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\n\nThe 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act went a long way in providing protections for pregnant workers, but there are still \u201cmajor holes\u201d in protections for millions of employees, Baptiste said. \u201cThe Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would close that protection gap, make reasonable accommodations available to pregnant workers when requested, and allow more pregnant workers to remain in the workforce at a time when the income and benefits are most needed.\u201d", "description": "Walmart, UPS and other major employers have faced charges of mistreating pregnant workers.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT187_elizab_ZG_20191011183721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
