Half-a-dozen senior Republicans, including those who both talk directly to Trump and advise him on everything from campaign strategy to policy, communications and fundraising, said in interviews that they fear the president's plan to tie Russia and Ukraine could be ineffective because it dismisses the seriousness of the allegations and the fact that he admitted his actions.\n\nTrump often likes to poll his confidants for strategic feedback. But the Trump allies said they\u2019re reluctant to challenge the president directly in this case because he's so angry to be facing an impeachment inquiry and so convinced he didn't do anything wrong. Besides, Trump believes his strategy to combat the Russia investigation was a success.\n\nNone of the advisers think Trump will be removed from office \u2014 not enough Senate Republicans would vote for that \u2014 but they say he\u2019s hurt himself in what is expected to be a tight reelection campaign. A Republican close to the president said the notion that impeaching Trump will help his campaign, as some are pushing, is ludicrous. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a positive,\u201d the person said flatly.\n\nTrump \u2014 who entered the White House with the least government experience in U.S. history \u2014 should have left campaign opposition research of Joe Biden to staff, this person said. \u201cWhat he did showed a lack of sophistication. He showed a lack of familiarity between how the government works and how the campaign works.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats officially opened an impeachment inquiry after learning Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden. Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have accused Biden, while he was serving as vice president, of helping Hunter Biden, who at one time served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, earn money in both Ukraine and China.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted Democrats launched the Ukraine investigation because they failed to find any evidence to impeach him after special counsel Robert Mueller concluded what he called the \u201cwitch hunt\u201d \u2014 the 2-year-long inquiry into the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThis is the greatest hoax. Now, it's gone on for a long time,\u201d he said last week. \u201cWe had the Mueller collusion delusion, OK? That went on for years. And that's finally done. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. ... Now I get three days of peace ... and I hear about the word impeachment. I said, \u2018What did I do now?\u2019\u201c\n\nDemocrats are trying to undo the Election regardless of FACTS! pic.twitter.com/cQ3B1bGD4L \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nWhite House aides and Trump\u2019s campaign have all pushed the same Russia-Ukraine connection. But it\u2019s a comparison that some of his campaign allies acknowledge is simply false.\n\n\u201cRussia was a complete and utter fantasy,\u201d said a person close to the Trump campaign. \u201cUkraine isn\u2019t. His actions were unseemly \u2026 not a ghost like Russia.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans say the latest form of the Trump defense risks backfiring on the president and his team given the very different circumstances.\n\nMichael Steel, a Republican strategist who worked for the presidential campaigns of Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, said the Ukraine controversy is much more clear-cut than Russia because Trump was personally involved, he admitted what he did and, perhaps most important, it happened while he already was sworn into office.\n\n\"He's president of the United States with all the power and influence that goes with that,\" Steel said.\n\nTrump admitted he asked Zelensky to look into the Bidens \u2014 and then openly called on China to do the same last week. He has insisted there\u2019s nothing wrong with his actions and defends himself in much the same way he did during the Russia investigation \u2014 attacking the Democrats, the media and his critics.\n\n\"You understand why they want to lump the two together \u2014 so in the public's mind they say Russia, Ukraine that's different how?\" said Doug Heye, a veteran Republican strategist. \"That's the ultimate goal.\u201c\n\nBut, he added, \u201cit's clear there are differences. There is a reality.\"\n\nA former campaign staffer said Trump doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience and comfort talking about certain topics, including foreign policy, and it shows. \u201cHe did it because he didn\u2019t know any better,\u201d the person said. \u201cIn his mind, he didn\u2019t say anything improper. ... It's naive and shows an almost innocence.\u201d\n\nTrump regularly breaks social norms when speaking to foreign leaders, using blunt language and bragging about accomplishments, some real and some perceived, but Democrats say this time he undermined the Constitution, national security and the integrity of elections.\n\n\u201cI think it was stupid but I see why he did it,\u201d said the outside Trump adviser. \u201cIt was an avoidable, unforced error.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Trump tried to characterize his actions more generally. \u201cThis is about corruption, not about politics,\u201d he said. But House Democrats had already received documents, including text messages, showing that some senior State Department officials believed aid to Ukraine was contingent on helping Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nA second Republican close to the president said Trump's problem is that he\u2018s still so fixated on anyone trying to discredit him during the 2016 election \u2014 including former President Barack Obama and his vice president \u2014 that he went after Biden. \u201cShould he have mentioned Biden? No,\u201d the person said. \u201cI wish he wouldn\u2019t have. ... But I don\u2019t fault him as much as other people.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign insists impeachment will help Trump in his reelection in part because the base is energized and the money is rolling in.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the campaign brought in 50,000 new donors in two days and raised $15 million in the first three days of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 the same amount Biden raised in the last three-month period.\n\n\u201cThe American people stand with the president they elected,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is backfiring magnificently on the Democrats, and they\u2019re too blinded by their obsession with taking down President Trump to see it.\u201d\n\nThe House is moving quickly to investigate and hopes to consider articles of impeachment by the end of the year. On Monday, Democrats subpoenaed documents from the Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nMichael Caputo, a former top adviser to Trump during his first campaign ensnared in the Russia investigation, praised Trump for fighting back against Democrats but said the president was always going to be impeached no matter how small the infraction.\n\n\u201cHe is going to be impeached for jaywalking,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cAny mistake the president makes they will impeach him on.\u201d\n\nDarren Samuelsohn contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/4f/6a/3f6c93cb4d0182a8628bc7602e72/191007-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
