Since the chamber fills passively and the environmental water acts as a piston, we can create a full combustion cycle with only one moving part, which is the pump that mixes the water with the fuel,\" he explained.\n\nREPUBLICAN SENATORS SLAM FACEBOOK FOR 'CENSORSHIP' OF PRO-LIFE CONTENT AS FACT-CHECKER FACES SCRUTINY\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe researchers tested the robot in a lab, in a lake, and in a wave tank, discovering that it can escape from the water's surface even under relatively rough conditions.\n\nRaphael Zufferey, first author on the paper said in a statement: \"These kinds of low-power, tether-free robots could be really useful in environments that are normally time- and resource-intensive to monitor, including after disasters such as floods or nuclear accidents.\"\n\nDetails about the robot were published in Science Robotics.", "description": "A bio-inspired robot can use water from the environment to launch itself into the air, researchers revealed.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/flying-robot-imperial-college-UK.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
