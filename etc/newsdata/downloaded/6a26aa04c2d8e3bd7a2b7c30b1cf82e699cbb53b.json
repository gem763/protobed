I keep telling her she did the right thing and she must never doubt herself.'\n\nPoppy-Leigh had been with her mother, her father Jake and her one-year-old brother David-James at around 3pm on Sunday and their first thought is that she had wandered off.\n\nThey had been browsing the stalls when Sarah-Jane turned to her husband to tell him she liked one of the items, and when she turned back, Poppy-Leigh had vanished.\n\nThe girl had been holding the side of her brother's pushchair when she was approached from behind. She told her mother she was hit in the back which subsequently made her let go of the pram.\n\nThe frightened youngster has since told her mother that the man told her to take his hand, and when she refused he grabbed her and walked away with her.\n\nPoppy-Leigh (above) had been learning about stranger danger at nursery and knew she was in a bad situation\n\nSarah-Jane described Poppy-Leigh as a 'confident little girl' and said she knew something was wrong as she had never wandered off in that way before.\n\nOnce she realised her daughter was missing, her and her husband split up and started shouting Poppy-Leigh's name, once others realised they were looking for a child, they also joined in the search.\n\nOne woman claimed she had seen Poppy-Leigh but that she had been crying with her father. Another man claimed he had also seen her but thought she had been with her father.\n\nSarah-Jane continued to run through the market and on to the car park where she says she saw a 'flash' of her daughter's white coat.\n\nShe said once she got to her daughter her face was crumpled and she was crying, her daughter then told her that 'the wrong man' had taken her.\n\nSarah-Jane said: 'She was sheet white and I was so relieved to get her in my arms but then when she told me what had actually had happened, I got sick.\n\n'She hadn't walked off, she'd been taken and she screamed and shouted at the man and struggled until she managed to get away from him and she hid in the car park.\n\n'Poppy-Leigh has been learning about stranger danger for the last six months, and she instinctively knew there was something bad going on and she needed to get away to safety.'\n\nNow Sarah-Jane says that Poppy-Leigh's hand is still sore and that the man had held her hand with 'great authority'.\n\nShe also said a tanoy announcement had been made at the market and praised the manager for staying with them until they spoke to police.\n\nSarah-Jane has now urged other parents to use reins for toddlers to stop this sort of thing happening again.\n\nShe added that Poppy-Leigh has been left 'traumatised' and also asked people to scan their memories for anything that might help police.\n\nThe PSNI are appealing for information about the incident on Sunday.\n\nA spokesperson said: 'At this stage it is believed that a male has taken the child's hand and led her away from the area.\n\n'Thankfully the young girl was not harmed in any way, although she is extremely traumatised by her ordeal.'\n\nPSNI Inspector Lindsay McCrea added: 'I would appeal to anyone who was at the market in Nutts Corner and who may have witnessed a male acting suspiciously in and around the stalls to contact police at Antrim on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 1130 06/10/19.\n\n'Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.'", "description": "Little Poppy-Leigh Gilmore (pictured) was out for the day with her family in County Antrim, Northern Ireland when she was snatched by a stranger on Sunday afternoon.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/10/19435628-0-image-a-2_1570527073961.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
