Mark Milley told reporters at the Pentagon.\n\nMilley also said that U.S. personnel have disposed of al-Baghdadi\u2019s remains after they were transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe disposal of his remains has been done and is complete and was handled appropriately,\u201d Milley said.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was killed in a joint operation by U.S. troops and Kurdish forces in northwestern Syria on Saturday, after he detonated a suicide vest as U.S. special operations forces cornered him in a tunnel, President Trump Donald John Trump'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Kayla Mueller's mother: Daughter might still be alive 'If Obama had been as decisive' as Trump MORE said on Sunday.\n\nMilley said intelligence from throughout the Defense Department and other agencies \u201cidentified the target location approximately four miles from the Turkish border in Idlib province of Syria.\u201d\n\nU.S. forces then flew by helicopter to the location to carry out the mission, and afterward used air-launched cruise missiles, guided bombs and Hellfire missiles to destroy the compound.\n\nMilley confirmed that material was taken from the compound, but would not describe it further, noting that \u201cthat information needs to be exploited property for any follow-on mission that we may choose.\u201d\n\nTrump said Sunday that the raid spanned two hours and concluded with U.S. forces taking \u201chighly sensitive material\u201d related to ISIS.\n\nThe president has since said that he may declassify and release part of the video taken of the raid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about it.
