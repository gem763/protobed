Another adult and minor were hospitalized with critical injuries and later died.\n\nThe Limestone county sheriff\u2019s office said a 14-year-old confessed to the killings.\n\nSheriff Mike Blakely told WAFF the victims were the teen\u2019s father, stepmother and siblings. Authorities did not describe any possible motive.\n\nA sheriff\u2019s spokesman, Stephen Young, said the teenager initially told a dispatcher he was downstairs when he heard gunshots on the home\u2019s upper floor. The sheriff\u2019s office said investigators recovered a handgun that had been tossed along a nearby roadside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely terrible thing, and I can\u2019t wrap my arms around it,\u201d Elkmont\u2019s mayor, Tracy Compton, told the News Courier.\n\n\u201cOur heartfelt condolences are extended to the family, the school, the whole community. It\u2019s just unimaginable,\u201d said Compton, who lives near the house where the shootings happened.\n\nYoung told WHNT that the 14-year-old attended Elkmont high school. The small town is north-west of Huntsville, near the Tennessee line.", "description": "Alabama%20teenager%20allegedly%20admits%20shooting%20dead%20five%20family%20members%20%7C%20Alabama%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/images/favicon-32x32.ico"}
