Bill Verbryke, the school president, announced Monday, while a Vatican body considers a request to allow the school to regain its status as a Catholic institution within the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.\n\nArchbishop Charles C. Thompson kicked Brebeuf Jesuit out of his archdiocese in June, after the school refused to follow his orders to fire math teacher Layton Payne-Elliott. The archdiocese said that Catholic school teachers are \u201cministers\u201d who are required to uphold church teachings, which prohibit same-sex marriages.\n\nJoshua Payne-Elliott, right, and his husband, Layton Payne-Elliott, were both employed as Catholic school teachers in Indianapolis.

Although the school was allowed to hold daily services in its chapel before the school day, Thompson denied its request to hold an all-school, traditional Mass to start the school year, IndyStar reported.\n\nThe Jesuit\u2019s Midwest province is appealing Thompson\u2019s decree with the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Catholic Education, a church body that oversees the world\u2019s Catholic schools. Verbryke said Monday that he does not know how long the appeals process will take.\n\n\u201cUltimately, our desire is to remain in full communion with the Catholic Church, without restrictions on our celebration of the Eucharist, and that our identity as a Catholic school be fully recognized and supported by the Archdiocese, as had been the case for our first 57 years,\u201d Verbryke wrote.\n\nThe archdiocese told the IndyStar that the Vatican\u2019s temporary suspension is a common practice that doesn\u2019t affect the appeal\u2019s outcome.\n\nArchbishop Charles Thompson leads the Archdiocese of Indianapolis.
