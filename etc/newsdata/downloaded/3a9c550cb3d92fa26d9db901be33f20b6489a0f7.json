An understandable position, given the offer of $13.25 cash per share was priced at a 59 per cent premium to where Bellamy's was trading immediately before the news.\n\nOn Thursday morning chairman John Ho told shareholders at the AGM held in Launceston, the deal with China Mengniu is the best way forward for the company, which has still not yet received necessary ticks from Beijing to sell Chinese-labelled organic baby formula in Chinese retail outlets.\n\n\"Throughout the negotiation period, your board considered whether the change in control was in the best and long-term interest of the company as a whole \u2013 for our customers, our employees, our various stakeholders and of course our shareholders,\" he said.\n\n\"After much deliberation, balancing of opportunities and risks, your Board believes Bellamy\u2019s will be well-served under the ownership of China Mengniu Dairy.\"\n\nThe takeover offer for Bellamy's has not been without tension. In September, crossbench senators accused China of \"market manipulation\" by delaying approving a the needed licence, and driving down its share price.\n\nChina Mengniu already owns a 79 per cent stake in Victorian dairy group Burra Foods after a buyout in late 2016.\n\nBellamy's confirmed that group revenue this year is expected to grow 10 per cent to 15 per cent on the prior year, implying sales of $292.8 million to $306.1 million. Sales are tipped to accelerate in the second half supported by new product launches such as Organic Ultra-Premium formula and Organic Goat Formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEBITDA margins are expected to be flat with the prior year, reflecting continued investment in marketing and its team in China.\n\nProxy firm ISS recommend against voting in favour of Bellamy's rem report, where Mr Cohen is expected to make more than $15.9 million if the China Mengniu takeover deal is approved, despite the share price falling by close to 50 per cent last financial year.\n\nAt the 2017 AGM, Bellamy's shareholders approved a long-term incentive package that awarded Bellamy's leaders hefty options, which would vest should they meet certain total shareholder return hurdles by 2020. But in the event of a change of corporate control, the options would vest en masse.\n\nBoth directors Rodd Peters and Chan Wai Chan are up for re-election. However, Mr Peters is major shareholder Jan Cameron's representative. The men both joined the board in February 2017 after Ms Cameron led the charge to spill the former board.", "description": "The takeover target's breakthrough new product portfolio gives Bellamy's confidence the growth can be sustained beyond this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f259d53237e80334fc6e1b46084a04dc400e683e", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
