From the NYT:\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: Sept. 15, 2019 An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book\u2019s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\n\nAs for how Brian Stelter is covering it? No biggie. This is the item from his daily newsletter:\n\n\u201cThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation\u201d by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. Their first TV interview will be on the third hour of \u201cToday\u201d Monday morning. Their book excerpt in the NYT\u2019s Sunday Review section sparked outrage, criticism, presidential tweets, an editors\u2019 note, and more\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s just pathetic:\n\nIn a media environment that included any ethical or journalistic standards, an editor would get fired for allowing those reporters to omit that fact from the original op-ed and allowing the mob to run wild claiming it was a credible allegation all day. \u2014 (((AG))) (@AG_Conservative) September 16, 2019\n\nWTF is going on over at the NYT?\n\nThe M.O. of Kavanaugh\u2019s critics all along has been to try to prop up each dubious and uncorroborated allegation with yet another dubious, uncorroborated allegation. The pathetic NYT excerpt is just the latest example \u2014 Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) September 16, 2019\n\nAnd some editors have some questions to answer:\n\nWhat a disgrace that an editor didn\u2019t inquire about this and that the authors didn\u2019t *volunteer* it pic.twitter.com/RAKiB67E9C \u2014 Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) September 16, 2019\n\n***", "description": "\"What a disgrace...\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-arm-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
