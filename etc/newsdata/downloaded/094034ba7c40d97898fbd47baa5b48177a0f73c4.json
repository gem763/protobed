If the info is correct, they\u2019ll have a new design and some new features to go along with them.\n\nGuilherme Rambo of 9to5Mac discovered a glyph in the iOS 13.2 beta that looks uncannily like a pair of earbuds \u2014 and the small tail is very characteristic of AirPods. Rambo found the icon \u201cin a component of the system related to accessibility settings\u201d and are apparently codenamed B298.\n\nCredit: Guilherme Rambo/9to5Mac\n\nAssuming this is what Rambo assumes it to be (and I\u2019m not sure what else it could be), then it would be mean the next iteration of Airpods would look quite a bit different from what we\u2019re used to. For starters, they appear to have a tips that fit into the ear canal, which Airpods have never before had. They also look slightly thinner than the current generation.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just shape that\u2019ll apparently change. Rambo also says that clues point to the AirPods 3 having a noise-cancelling feature apparently called \u201cfocus mode.\u201d This dovetails with previous rumors: Bloomberg\u2018s Mark Gurman reported last year that Apple was working on new AirPods with noise-cancellation. They\u2019ll also allegedly be water-resistant. The latter feature was corroborated by a note from analyst Daniel Ives reported by Philip Elmer-Dewitt.\n\nThe noise-cancellation feature would explain why the general shape of the AirPods is being redesigned. AirPods as they are currently don\u2019t really seal into ear well enough to make noise-cancelling work.\n\nAs yet, we have no idea when we\u2019ll be seeing the next generation of AirPods. An AirPods 3 prototype was allegedly leaked last month, but we have no way of confirming if it\u2019s anything like what we\u2019ll be getting. The ever-reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts two new AirPod models will go into mass production between Q4 2019 and Q1 2020. The report from Elmer-DeWitt suggests they\u2019ll be available by this year\u2019s holiday season, but it\u2019s already October and we\u2019ve heard nothing official yet about new AirPods.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Apple and will update if we receive a response.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F10%2F27Octblog1.png&signature=2f0e7b40d5b2f8bca145a941fde594c0", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
