These articles, documenting the Pentagon\u2019s now-defunct UFO-monitoring project (the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program) and historical sightings of mysterious, still-unidentified aircraft by Navy pilots, did something that is not ever really done with reporting on UFOs: they took them somewhat seriously.\n\nWith these reports came the release of three pieces of footage, all taken by Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets, each showing a blob with no discernible means of propulsion manoeuvring in ways inconsistent with how aircraft normally move, with accompanying voice-over from very confused pilots.\n\nDespite the scrutiny applied to these videos, we still have no fucking idea what was captured on film. Only just last month, the Navy confirmed that the videos are authentic, and reiterated that the \u201cphenomena contained/depicted\u201d in them remains, to this day, \u201cunidentified\u201d. The first of the three videos above (\u2018FLIR1\u2019) was, according to the Navy, captured on November 14, 2004, by a patrol that was sent out to investigate a sighting made earlier that day off the coast of San Diego.\n\nThe pilot of the F/A-18 that made that first sighting, Commander David Fravor, described seeing something big and weird to the New York Times in 2017:\n\nHovering 50 feet above the churn was an aircraft of some kind \u2014 whitish \u2014 that was around 40 feet long and oval in shape. The craft was jumping around erratically, staying over the wave disturbance but not moving in any specific direction, Commander Fravor said. The disturbance looked like frothy waves and foam, as if the water were boiling. Commander Fravor began a circular descent to get a closer look, but as he got nearer the object began ascending toward him. It was almost as if it were coming to meet him halfway, he said. Commander Fravor abandoned his slow circular descent and headed straight for the object. But then the object peeled away. \u201cIt accelerated like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said in the interview. He was, he said, \u201cpretty weirded out.\u201d\n\nIf that tantalising snippet wasn\u2019t enough for you, I have just tremendous news: You can watch him talk about it for a good two hours courtesy of Joe Rogan and his podcast:\n\nFravor appeared alongside documentary filmmaker Jeremy Corbell, who directed Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers, the somewhat-less-authoritative documentary on supposed UFO \u2018whistleblower\u2019 Bob Lazar.\n\nFor the most part, Fravor reiterates the (admittedly quite good) story of his encounter, but there are a few juicy extra tidbits in there. In this interview, Fravor describes the \u2018boiling water\u2019 beneath the object as indicating something subsurface about the size and shape of a Boeing 737, and suggests as a theory that whatever it was underwater might have been communicating with whatever the UFO was.\n\nFravor also seemingly agrees (or, at least, doesn\u2019t noticeably disagree) with Corbell\u2019s categorisation of the UFOs captured in the three videos possessing some sort of \u201cnon-reactionary field propulsion system\u201d, which would explain the strange movement and the lack of visible exhaust.\n\nAccording to Fravor, the craft in the Gimbal video wasn\u2019t alone, with radar picking up a v-formation of other, similar objects. Corbell described this particular bit of information as having never been released to the public before.\n\nAs far as UFO people go, Fravor sounds like a pretty credible person, even if there are some who dispute his interpretation of what he saw.\n\nDisclosure when??\n\n(I cannot repeat enough times that all of this is happening because of Tom DeLonge.)", "description": "A US Navy pilot who had a well documented experience with a UFO while flying off the West Coast in 2004 has talked about it on 'Joe Rogan'.", "authors": ["Ben Mcleay"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-6.52.18-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
