For conservatives, the seminal moment came with Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s failed attempt to expand the high bench in 1937, making any further effort at such New Deal court-packing anathema.\n\nWhat liberals failed to realize was that the enlightened moderation of the Warren bench and its immediate successors was an exception to a Supreme Court that, for most of its history, was a citadel of reaction. At its height of power in the Gilded Age it served as an imperial judiciary that overrode popular sovereignty subordinating man-made statutes to a doctrine of market-oriented \u201cnatural law\u201d that defied precedent. Weaponizing the court to carry out a political agenda has a venerable pedigree.", "description": "Since Andrew Jackson added two cronies to create the now hallowed nine-Justice court, it\u2019s almost always served as a reactionary instrument against workers and the popular will.", "authors": ["Jack Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570327795/191006-schwartz-supreme-court-not-your-friend-hero-1_avybms", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
