Mushosho said it was imperative that the company reduce its costs of doing business due to relentless economic challenges in Zimbabwe.\n\nGiven the high the high inflation rate and the need to control total operating costs, it is important for the business to reduce costs, said Mushosho.\n\n\"Management is therefore tabling an offer for a voluntary staff retrenchment scheme on an improved package,\" the memo said.\n\nHe said management would endeavour to conclude the current round of retrenchments timeously in order to preserve the value of the package.\n\nZimbabwe is officially experiencing hyperinflation, it was announced last week. The country is also facing regular fuel price hikes, data price hikes, and its worst drought in almost four decades.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Old Mutual Zimbabwe has offered employees an improved retrenchment package after the first offer, made earlier this year, was met with limited uptake.", "authors": ["Crecey Kuyedzwa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3968/5731600d64a54a6f93a6d4d1d5ce3a30.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
