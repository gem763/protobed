The project, which started in 2007, aims to combat the spread of the Sahara Desert and improve the state of one of the world's poorest regions.\n\n\n\nMore than a decade into the project, the Great Green Wall is about 15 percent complete. Those involved in the process believe land restoration can help improve food security, provide jobs and, ultimately, stem migration.\n\n\n\nIn this episode, we'll learn about the relationship between climate change and desertification and check in on the progress and challenges involved in restoring once degraded lands.\n\nOn this episode of The Stream, we speak with:\n\nInna Modja @Innamodja\n\nNarrator of the Great Green Wall documentary\n\ninnamodja.com\n\nElvis Paul Tangem @tangem2009\n\nCoordinator of the Great Green Wall Initiative for Sahara and Sahel, African Union Commission\n\ngreatgreenwall.org\n\nDr. Musonda Mumba @MumbaMusondam\n\nEnvironmentalist and ecologist\n\nmusondamumba.com\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nCan a 4,815-Mile Wall of Trees Help Curb Climate Change in Africa? - TIME\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
