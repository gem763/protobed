TWIST.\n\nThe 54-year-old revealed her bombshell theory while speaking to News.com.au.\n\nSarah had the receipts (Picture: GC Images)\n\nSJP said: \u2018Sometimes I\u2019m like, we don\u2019t even know if Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte were real.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I\u2019m like, hmmm, just to mess with myself. Think about it \u2013 did Carrie make them up? She\u2019s telling a story every week. This is her point of view, it\u2019s almost always her point of view.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is pretty convenient that Carrie\u2019s three besties managed to have problems of a similar theme every week to fill up Bradshaw\u2019s column by deadline\u2026\n\nThe actress continued to show receipts, saying: \u2018When Carrie went to Paris and left her computer, for the first time Carrie wasn\u2019t telling the story. In the entire run of the series, if you think about it for a second, right?\n\nWe couldn\u2019t help but wonder\u2026 was Carrie making it up? (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018She left her computer which was the conduit (through) which the audiences knows about Charlotte, Miranda \u2026 Samantha.\u2019\n\nPerhaps Carrie was a better writer than we thought.\n\nSex And The City ran for six seasons from 1998 until 2004, following Carrie and her best friends as they navigated sex, love and fashion in New York City.\n\nWe rejoined the gang in the film adaptation in 2008 and its sequel in 2010 \u2013 although the less said about the latter, the better \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll be having Cosmos with the girls any time soon.\n\nA third Sex And The City film was shelved after Kim Cattrall refused to return, causing a major row between her and Parker.\n\nSarah told Extra: \u2018It\u2019s over\u2026we\u2019re not doing it. I\u2019m disappointed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It\u2019s not just disappointing that we don\u2019t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.\u2019\n\nThe third movie was believed to kill off Mr Big early in the film, and apparently included a storyline about Miranda\u2019s now teenage son Brady sending Samantha d*** pics.\n\nYeah, we can kind of understand why Kim wanted out.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
