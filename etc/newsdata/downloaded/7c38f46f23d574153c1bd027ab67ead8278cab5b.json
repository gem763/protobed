Elizabeth Warren promised that she\u2019d reveal how she\u2019d pay the $36 trillion (and climbing) cost of Medicare for All some time \u201cin the coming weeks.\u201d If she claims that it can be financed entirely on the backs of corporations and the rich, she will be lying.\n\nThat\u2019s made clear by a report from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which is decidedly non-partisan. After studying tax data, it concluded that \u201cTax increases on high earners, corporations, and the financial sector by themselves could not cover much more than one-third of the cost of Medicare for All.\u201d\n\nThe report notes that \u201cthere is not enough annual income available among higher earners to finance the full cost of Medicare for All. \u2026 Even increasing the top two income tax rates (applying to individuals making over $204,000 per year and couples making over $408,000 per year) to 100% would not raise $30 trillion over a decade.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the report shows just how massive the tax hikes would have to be to come close to raising the money needed.\n\nAmong the options the CRFB considers that would raise $30 trillion:\n\nAdding a 32% payroll tax on all wages, on top of the 15% already imposed to finance Social Security and Medicare.\n\nImposing 25% surtax on all income above the standard deduction, which would result in the lowest tax bracket of 35%.\n\nCreating a 42% value-added tax.\n\nImposing a mandatory premium of $7,200 for every individual in the nation.\n\nMore than doubling individual and corporate taxes.\n\nCutting the rest of the federal budget by 80%.\n\nMore than doubling the national debt.\n\nAs the CRFB points out, these options would all have punishing impacts on the economy. Increasing the payroll tax will cost jobs and sharply reduce economic growth. Doubling income taxes will raise the top rate to close to 90%. A VAT would amount to a massive new tax on middle-class families. Piling on more debt to an already unsustainable trajectory would be catastrophic.\n\nKeep in mind that these options assume Medicare for All only costs $30 trillion over 10 years, which is a completely unrealistic, low-ball estimate unless the intention is to completely destroy the health care system in addition to the economy.\n\nNor does the CRFB attempt to figure out how Warren would cover Medicare for All, while also promising nearly $10 trillion in other new federal spending programs.\n\nIs it any wonder Warren isn\u2019t being forthcoming with how she\u2019ll pay for this?\n\nEven Sen. Bernie Sanders, who at least admits that everyone\u2019s taxes will have to go up, won\u2019t provide any details. All he\u2019s done is list \u201coptions\u201d that, taken all together, wouldn\u2019t cover half of Medicare for All\u2019s tab.\n\nWhen pressed for details by CNBC\u2019s John Harwood how he\u2019d cover the other half, Sanders would only say: \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to come up with an exact detailed plan of how every American \u2014 how much you\u2019re going to pay more in taxes, how much I\u2019m going to pay. I don\u2019t think I have to do that right now.\u201d\n\nOf course, Sanders and Warren have provided plenty of details on all the goodies Americans would supposedly get under Medicare for All. No premiums, no deductibles, no limits on doctor visits, first-dollar coverage for drugs, vision, dental and everything else under the sun.\n\nWarren keeps telling the public not to worry, that middle-class families\u2019 \u201ccosts\u201d will go down. But without providing any realistic plan to pay for all that largesse, she can\u2019t credibly make that claim.\n\nWarren and Sanders aren\u2019t on the fringes. They now represent the mainstream of the Democratic Party. It\u2019s time for them to come clean about what socializing health care will mean for taxpayers.\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
