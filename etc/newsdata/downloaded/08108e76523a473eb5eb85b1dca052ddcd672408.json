Baleka Mbete\n\nOver the past quarter century, access to education has significantly improved and the rights of all South Africans to free basic healthcare has been guaranteed.\n\nBut the ANC's successes have been overshadowed by rising youth unemployment, recent xenophobic attacks on African immigrants and ongoing allegations of systemic corruption, with former President Jacob Zuma currently facing trial.\n\nFrom fighting apartheid, Mbete rose to become one of South Africa's most powerful women, serving as deputy president, speaker of the National Assembly, and chair of the ANC.\n\nWe ask whether the ANC, and Mbete personally, have done enough to hold Zuma to account, and keep Mandela's dream of a united Africa alive.\n\nHasan and Mbete are joined by a panel of three experts:\n\nMakhosi Khoza - former South African politician who resigned from the ANC in 2017, after calling for President Zuma to step down\n\nXolani Xala - founder of South African Business Abroad and member of the ANC\n\nAndrew Feinstein - former South African politician and author of 'After the Party: A Personal Journey Inside the ANC'. He is now director of Corruption Watch UK\n\nHas South Africa's ruling party betrayed Mandela's legacy?
