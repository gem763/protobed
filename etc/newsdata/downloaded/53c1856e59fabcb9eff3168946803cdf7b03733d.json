If we don't get a win, we're out of the tournament.\"\n\nScotland's openside flanker Fraser Brown said there were \"no two bigger games with what's on the line\".\n\n\"You're playing for a place in the knock-out stage of the World Cup.\"\n\nBrown said the turnaround would be tough between games, but insisted the focus was solely on Russia.\n\n\"You can't hide away from the fact that it's difficult to play two test matches in four days,\" said Brown. \"But you have to get on with it, get your head in it, get ready for Russia and as soon as that game against Russia is finished, we'll have to get prepared properly in the time we have for Japan.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Welsh coach Lyn Jones has made four changes from the team that battled well despite defeat by Ireland.\n\n\"We appreciate how difficult a victory would be, but Scottish people are not different from everybody else,\" Jones said. \"They are human beings who are fallible when put under pressure. It's for us just to bring a little bit extra to our game.\"\n\nRussia captain Vasily Artemyev, who has become a popular figure in Japan thanks to his bushy mustache, never-say-die attitude and thick Irish accent -- the latter thanks to being schooled in Ireland, said Scotland were similar to the Irish, with dominant half-backs who look to control the game.\n\n\"We will try to do better as we improve with every game at this tournament,\" the full-back said. \"We'll try to improve more and to create problems for Scotland's defense and put their attacks under pressure.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Scotland are targeting a bonus-point victory, and nothing less, over Russia on Wednesday to set up a Pool A showdown with hosts Japan for a spot in the quarterfinals.
