Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) peaks at a campaign event on Sept. 27 in Hollis, N.H. (Cheryl Senter/AP)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 100% grassroots-funded.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), in a tweet, July 26\n\n\u201cWe are 100% funded at the grassroots level.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in an interview with Rolling Stone, Sept. 13\n\nSanders and Warren have been raking in campaign cash as 2020 presidential candidates, most of it from donors giving $200 or less.\n\nFor this election cycle, the two liberal senators self-imposed fundraising restrictions \u2014 swearing off PAC money and cozy fundraising events with wealthy donors, for example.\n\nBoth are ardent critics of the glut of money in politics, and because of their self-imposed limits, both say their campaigns are \u201c100 percent\u201d funded by grass-roots donors.\n\nThese identical claims got our interest.\n\nSanders and Warren have raised most of their campaign money this year from small-dollar donations. Yet both also have tapped millions of dollars left over from previous campaigns \u2014 from a time when they had not yet adopted the strict fundraising practices they currently follow. That complicates their claim to \u201c100 percent\u201d grass-roots purity.\n\nIt\u2019s a good example of how the complexities of the campaign finance system sometimes get blurred in the service of an appealing talking point. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nThe Facts\n\nSanders had raised $46.3 million by the end of the second quarter, according to Federal Election Commission records. That includes $10.1 million transferred from previous campaigns.\n\nWhen not counting transfers, 77 percent of Sanders\u2019s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. That\u2019s the highest share of small-dollar donations relative to total fundraising among all major candidates. When counting transfers, the share of small-dollar donations is 60 percent.\n\nWarren had raised $35.6 million by the end of the second quarter, FEC records show. That includes $10.4 million transferred from her 2018 Senate campaign.\n\nWhen not counting transfers, 67 percent of Warren\u2019s fundraising this year came from donations of $200 or less. When counting transfers, the proportion is 48 percent.\n\n\u201cGrass-roots funding\u201d has no formal definition. Sanders and Warren seem to define it in terms of the money they won\u2019t accept.\n\nSanders doesn\u2019t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn\u2019t accept money from corporate PACs or super PACs, or from fossil fuel, drug or insurance companies. Warren doesn\u2019t hold closed-door fundraisers to solicit high-dollar contributions and doesn\u2019t accept money from federal lobbyists or PACs.\n\nConsidering these restrictions, it\u2019s plausible to describe all the money Sanders and Warren have raised directly this year as grass-roots funding.\n\nBut there\u2019s another piece of the pie here. As noted, Sanders and Warren each have transferred nearly $10 million from previous campaigns to their 2020 presidential committees.\n\nIn Sanders\u2019s case, FEC records show he had transferred $4.6 million from his 2016 to 2020 presidential campaign committee as of the end of the second quarter.\n\nIn his previous presidential campaign, Sanders had somewhat looser fundraising restrictions in place. News reports show he held at least a few events in 2015 where he sought high-dollar donations.\n\nTime magazine reported in December 2015: \u201cSanders has hosted at least nine medium- to high-dollar, closed-door fundraisers in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere to directly fund his own presidential campaign. Even though Sanders\u2019 efforts sometimes have a proletarian flair \u2014 he held one $200-per-ticket fundraiser at a dive bar near a grungy Seattle park \u2014 some aspects of the Democratic insurgent\u2019s fundraising are similar to the candidates he condemns.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported in October 2015: \u201cMr. Sanders was cheered at a fancy campaign fund-raiser at the Hollywood home of Syd Leibovitch, a high-end real estate agent, and his wife, Linda, on Wednesday night. Tickets for the event sold for a minimum of $250. Those who spent the maximum, $2,700, or who raised $10,000, were invited to a \u2018pre-event reception,\u2019 according to the invitation.\u201d\n\nSanders spokeswoman Sarah Ford said: \u201cIn 2016, we held zero closed-door fundraisers with high-dollar donors and accepted no donations from corporate PACs, corporate lobbyists or super PACs.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked about the high-dollar fundraising in 2015, though, a Sanders aide said, \u201cWe do not plan to transfer the amount of money from the 2016 account that came from fundraisers with high-dollar donors in attendance.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders aide added that, for the 2020 campaign, grass-roots fundraisers \u201crun alongside the senator\u2019s schedule at public venues and are live-streamed on social media.\u201d The aide added: \u201cThey are open to the public and tickets start at $27.\u201d\n\nIn Warren\u2019s case, FEC records show she jump-started her presidential campaign this year with a $10.4 million transfer from her 2018 Senate committee. The infusion allowed her to build a campaign apparatus early in the race.\n\nFor her 2018 Senate reelection campaign, Warren raised money at events with high-dollar donors. A search of her FEC records showed max contributions of $5,400 from the chief executives of DreamWorks and Yelp, media mogul Haim Saban, philanthropist Alexander Soros, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, hedge fund owners and wealthy investors, and some donors who have given millions to the Democratic Party. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Spielberg and actress Barbra Streisand each donated $2,700 to Warren\u2019s Senate campaign. (The contribution limit for individuals is $2,700 per race, but they can give that amount for both a primary and general election.)\n\nWarren also benefited from some PAC donations when she ran for Senate, though it was a small share of her fundraising, as we explained in this fact check.\n\nWarren raised $6 million in donations of $1,000 or more to her 2018 Senate campaign, a spokesman said. That\u2019s about 23 percent of her total $25.8 million fundraising for that race. According to OpenSecrets, Sanders raised nearly $28 million in donations of $1,000 or more to his 2016 presidential campaign, a little more than 10 percent of his total $232 million haul for that race.\n\n\u201cThe open secret of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency,\u201d the Times reported this month, noting \u201ctrips to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Philadelphia \u2014 all with fundraisers on the agenda.\u201d\n\nFormer Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, a Democrat who supports former vice president Joe Biden in the primary, called Warren a hypocrite in a recent Washington Post op-ed. \u201cThe senator appears to be trying to have it both ways \u2014 get the political upside from eschewing donations from higher-level donors and running a grass-roots campaign, while at the same time using money obtained from those donors in 2018,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Warren campaign in response to our questions said the average contribution to her Senate campaign in 2018 was $29.45, a sign of broad appeal among grass-roots donors.\n\nWarren also \u201craised or donated $11 million to Democrats running for office and state parties in all 50 states,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\n\u201cElizabeth\u2019s schedule is filled with town halls and selfie lines, not closed-door fundraisers with millionaires and billionaires, because she believes that to take back the White House we need to build a grassroots movement,\u201d Warren spokesman Chris Hayden wrote in an email. \u201cWhen we made the decision to run the campaign this way, the players in the usual money-for-influence game dismissed it as naive and said it would never work and it would kill the campaign. We're pleased that our grassroots strategy has been so effective that they're now threatened enough to be attacking us for it.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nSanders and Warren say they\u2019re running presidential campaigns funded \u201c100%\u201d by grass-roots donors. It\u2019s a big claim with no wiggle room.\n\nMoney is fungible, so it\u2019s an artifice to claim that money from wealthy donors last time around isn\u2019t being used this time around.\n\nThe key here is that Sanders and Warren define their presidential campaigns as entirely grass-roots-funded because of their self-imposed restrictions: no hobnobbing with rich donors in closed events and no PAC money, for example.\n\nBut Warren held high-dollar fundraisers for her 2018 Senate run, and then transferred $10.4 million from that campaign account to her presidential committee. Her Senate run raised $6 million from donors who gave $1,000 or more, and she also took some PAC contributions.\n\nSanders in 2015 sought and received big checks from wealthy donors. Sanders\u2019s 2020 committee so far has gotten $4.6 million from his prior presidential campaign.\n\nThese are omissions worthy of Two Pinocchios. As a share of total fundraising, however, Sanders was less dependent than Warren on high-dollar contributions in his previous campaign.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "Both Democratic contenders are using millions of dollars from previous campaigns, when they were more open to contributions from wealthy donors.", "authors": ["Salvador Rizzo", "Reporter For The Fact Checker", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5342AzePfDTYHww4pEXkxxZVupc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZQ4U2BXCIII6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
