We\u2019re looking for the big deal,\u201d he told reporters at a joint press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a partial deal, I\u2019m looking for a complete deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said a Chinese trade pact would probably give him a political boost but he\u2019s not setting a November 2020 deadline.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need it before the election,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think people know that we\u2019re doing a great job.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said negotiators will try to sort out the U.S.-China trade war in meetings next month. Increasing tariffs between the countries have rattled investors and retailers, though Mr. Trump said his course is the right one.\n\nHe insisted, again, that China is facing the brunt of the pain from the tariffs on billions of dollars in goods.\n\nMr. Morrison supported Mr. Trump\u2019s stance.\n\nHe wants to see a U.S.-China deal, but \u201cwhat is necessary is [that] deals have got to be fair,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cDeals have got to be good deals, deals have got to be sustainable deals.\u201d\n\nHe said Australia has benefited from China\u2019s economic development, though the Chinese must play fair if they want to be in the big leagues.\n\nHe also said he isn\u2019t worried about being caught in the crossfire of the trade war, citing nearly three decades of sustained economic growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve diversified our trade base and have been doing that for many years,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
