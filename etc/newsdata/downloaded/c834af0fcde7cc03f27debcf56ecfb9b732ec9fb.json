Clear Showdown: Here's the Expedited Airport Experience I Found With the Best Value", "language": "en", "text": "I strongly believe that there is no better start to a trip than a security line that moves like a well-oiled machine.\n\nPart of this fixation has to do with my inability to arrive at an airport earlier than I find necessary. I\u2019m the type of traveler who claims to have a well-crafted system that gets me to my gate just in time to board, so I don\u2019t spend idle minutes buying food at the airport. And yeah \u2014 when everyone moves at the pace I account for, it works like a dream.\n\nBut every now and then, security throws me a curveball. My heart rate goes up, my shoes are off well before I reach the conveyor belt, and my patience dwindles for everyone and everything. I\u2019m aware of my role in it all, and yet the tolerance involved in creeping through a winding security line, the speed of which depends on the know-how of hundreds of civilians\u2026 it\u2019s tests me.\n\nSo you better believe I watched carefully as the world started rolling out services designed to expedite airport security \u2014 the least predictable part of my journey. I was hesitant to spend the money, but recently I tried the two most popular domestic options, Clear and TSA Precheck, and took the opportunity to compare accessibility, perks, restrictions, and price points along the way.\n\nWhat Is Clear and How Good Is It?\n\nWe had arrived at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport with just enough time before take off, when my very cautious travel companion requested I sign up for the free month-long trial period Clear was temporarily offering. He had recently done so himself, and the kiosk to register stood right there between us and the security line that was making him feel all kinds of feelings.\n\nThe kiosks, which Clear started installing all over the country in 2010, are available at terminals in 31 airports across the U.S. Each one is manned by an attendant eagerly waiting to help you register or, if you\u2019re already a member, escort you right up to the podium: Using only your fingerprint or eye, the machine accesses your identification details \u2014 and eventually your boarding pass \u2014 so the attendant can vouch for you, effectively removing the identity verification part of your security experience (AKA the line).\n\nAfter the free trial period, I would be charged $179 a year \u2014 a hefty price that would only be waived if I was a Delta SkyMiles member. I was not a member, but they were speaking my language about that line, and I was eager to see if this was a luxury I\u2019d be willing to pay for. Fortunately for my friend, the onboarding process was incredibly fast. It took five minutes to answer a few questions and scan my fingers and eyes, and before I knew it, we were at our gate with time to spare, my travel buddy breathing easy again.\n\nFrom then on, all I had to do was go to a kiosk at any Clear-friendly terminal to scan a fingertip and my boarding pass and an attendant would lead me right up to the podium where a TSA agent would glance down at my boarding pass and let me through. Then I would go through security the normal way: shoes off, liquids out \u2026you know the drill.\n\nBy the time my month long trial ended, I had only had a taste of that front-of-the-line freedom, so I snoozed my reminder to cancel my membership and paid the annual fee. Given the year full of weddings that was ahead of me, I felt like I was paying for my time. That is, until I hit the inevitable. When I went home for the holidays, there were so many people using Clear that the TSA agents were faced with a multi-line bottleneck situation. I felt like I paid $179 to stand there and wonder where my perks were.\n\nIt was incredibly convenient when it worked. But between the occasional backed-up line and having to fervently ask \u201cBut do you have Clear?!\u201d at every new terminal, I wasn\u2019t prepared to pay that $179 again.\n\nMy TSA PreCheck Experience\n\nI would have gone back to the traditional life of line-standing, but my new Chase Sapphire Reserve Card gave me a relevant perk: waiving the $85 fee for a five-year TSA PreCheck membership.\n\nSo once my Clear membership expired, I got started on the TSA PreCheck onboarding process, which turned out to be much longer and more multifold than Clear\u2019s.\n\nFirst, I applied online and scheduled an in-person interview. I waited three weeks, because the only appointments I could get within a week were at airports and honestly \u2014 who wants to do both ends of a New York travel day in one morning? The actual interview was surprisingly painless. I was out in 31 minutes, but I still had to wait to be approved so I could get my Known Traveler Number (KTN), which is the identification number that allows me to use my new TSA PreCheck status. They said it would take a couple of weeks, but it was only a matter of days before it was in my inbox. The whole process took just shy of 25 days.", "description": "'There\u2019s something so liberating about being in a line where no one is fumbling with their belongings.'", "authors": ["Prachi Bhardwaj"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lUiC9B0WLselLC.G0Nq0zQ--~B/aD0xOTIwO3c9Mjg4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/acd06c7398c86216d132fbbc223f07ec", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
