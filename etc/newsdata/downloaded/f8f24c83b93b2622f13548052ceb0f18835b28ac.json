In the final round, Conwell caught Day with a left hook that floored him, causing his head to slam against the canvas as he fell onto his back.\n\nMedical personnel rushed into the ring once the fight was stopped by the referee and attended to Day, who never regained consciousness and was led out on a stretcher. He suffered a seizure in an ambulance while en route to the hospital and eventually went into a coma after emergency brain surgery.\n\nDAZN, the streaming platform that aired the bout, offered its condolences in a tweet.\n\n\"DAZN is incredibly saddened to learn about the passing of Patrick Day,\" a DAZN spokesman said in a statement. \"Our heartfelt thoughts are with his family and friends during this difficult time.\"\n\nOn Monday, Conwell opened up about Saturday's events.\n\n\u201cI never meant for this to happen to you,\" he wrote in an Instagram caption that took the form of a letter to Day. \"All I ever wanted to do was win. If I could take it all back I would [sic] no one deserves for this to happen to them. I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it myself I prayed for you so many times and shedded [sic] so many tears because I couldn\u2019t even imagine how my family and friends would feel.\"\n\nPrior to his loss to Conwell, Day suffered a unanimous decision loss to prospect Carlos Adames and won six fights in a row before that, according to BoxRec.\n\nIn 2012, Day was the New York Daily News Golden Glove Champion, USA Boxing welterweight national champion, and winner of the Sugar Ray Robinson Outstanding Athlete award.\n\nDay is the third boxer to die this year as a result of injuries sustained in the ring.

He collapsed at the end of the fight.\n\n\"It becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this,\" DiBella said. \" This is not a time where edicts or pronouncements are appropriate, or the answers are readily available. It is, however, a time for a call to action. While we don't have the answers, we certainly know many of the questions, have the means to answer them, and have the opportunity to respond responsibly and accordingly and make boxing safer for all who participate.\"\n\nFox News' Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.", "description": "Middleweight\u00a0boxer Patrick Day has died days after suffering traumatic brain injuries in a\u00a0brutal knockout loss, his promoter\u00a0said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19286090024013.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
