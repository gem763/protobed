REUTERS/Vincent Kessler/File Photo\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) still expects the grounding of Boeing Co\u2019s (BA.N) 737 MAX jetliner to reduce its cash flow by $1.4 billion in 2019, provided the aircraft remains grounded all year, GE Chief Executive Larry Culp said during a conference call on quarterly earnings on Wednesday.\n\nGE and French partner Safran SA (SAF.PA) make engines for the jet.\n\n\u201cAs we think about 2020, I think we\u2019re going to try to follow Boeing\u2019s lead here,\u201d Culp said, responding to an analyst question.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the full-year cash headwinds this year due to MAX, that, obviously, assumes that we don\u2019t see a return to service this year,\u201d he said. He added the forecast is conservative.\n\nGE\u2019s chief financial officer, Jamie Miller, said GE still expects \u201cthe year to be impacted to the tune of about negative $1.4 billion.\u201d She said it was \u201cdifficult to predict\u201d the financial impact on GE in 2020 and beyond.\n\nBoeing has said it expects the jet to clear approval by U.S. regulators by year-end. Global aviation regulators grounded the jet after a second fatal crash last March.", "description": "General Electric Co still expects the grounding of Boeing Co's 737 MAX jetliner to reduce its cash flow by $1.4 billion in 2019, provided the aircraft remains grounded all year, GE Chief Executive Larry Culp said during a conference call on quarterly earnings on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446537671&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T14Q", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
