South Africa adapted their gameplan for Japan last week and set out to physically impose themselves on the opposition. That involved a lot of driving mauls and forward domination.\n\nOn Sunday, Wales will also try to impose themselves and the side that do it better will probably win.\n\nWe\u2019ve got two juggernaut packs coming up against one another but, as a winger, I\u2019m just as excited about the battle out wide. Here are my key match-ups:\n\nFormer South Africa International Bryan Habana picks his key battles for Wales's semi-final\n\nDUANE VERMEULEN v JUSTIN TIPURIC\n\nThey have different numbers on their shirt but they are two of the world\u2019s classiest back-row forwards. Duane is pure grunt, South Africa\u2019s very own Thor. If you\u2019re tackled by him, you know about it.\n\nHe\u2019s a threat in attack and defence and so hard to get off the ball. Wales will be disappointed to lose Josh Navidi but Tipuric is strong enough to lead that loose trio. I\u2019m a massive fan of his running skills.\n\nWith his silky hands, he does things you don\u2019t expect from a loose forward. He can have several game-changing moments in a match, whether it\u2019s the breakdown or his link play.\n\nDuane Vermeulen is a pure grunt, South Africa\u2019s very own Thor - you don't want to be hit by him\n\nFAF DE KLERK v GARETH DAVIES\n\nFaf's golden locks make him stand out a little bit but his play has been equally eye-catching.\n\nHe was nominated for World Player of the Year in 2018 and he brings so much energy. If Faf\u2019s playing well, South Africa play well. Both sets of half-backs are very similar.\n\nThey like to speed up the tempo and they aren\u2019t shy of contact. Faf and Gareth Davies have scored some good tries and they\u2019ve got fly-halves outside them who like to attack the gain line. They\u2019re both very tactically orientated in terms of making sure they play in the right areas of the field.\n\nMAK MAPIMPI v GEORGE NORTH\n\nAll four wingers on the pitch are excellent athletes. They work off their wings incredibly well and try to get their hands on the ball as much as possible. George North can bash through the forwards and score out wide. It\u2019s incredible that North is 27 and already has 90 caps.\n\nJosh Adams has been exceptional under Biggar\u2019s high balls and Mapimpi\u2019s support lines are wonderful. In previous World Cups, we\u2019ve had little guys like Shane Williams, Nehe Milner-Skudder and Jason Robinson light up the tournament.\n\nThis year we\u2019ve seen Adams, Kenki Fukuoka, Kotaro Matsushima and Cheslin Kolbe, who unfortunately is injured for Sunday.\n\nGeorge North, who has 90 caps, can bash through the forwards and score out wide\n\nFAF DE KLERK v GARETH DAVIES\n\nFaf's golden locks make him stand out a little bit but his play has been equally eye-catching.\n\nHe was nominated for World Player of the Year in 2018 and he brings so much energy. If Faf\u2019s playing well, South Africa play well. Both sets of half-backs are very similar.\n\nThey like to speed up the tempo and they aren\u2019t shy of contact.
