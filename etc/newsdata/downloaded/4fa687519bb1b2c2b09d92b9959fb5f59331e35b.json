This story also says to me that we have to keep up our good work of calming down asteroid rhetoric. City-killers, nukes, etc.\u201d\n\nAccording to NASA\u2019s informational statement about OK 2019 from last month, had the asteroid hit Earth, it would have created \u201clocalized devastation to an area roughly 50 miles across.\u201d If it had fallen in the ocean, it would have been a \u201cbad day for any sailing vessels in the vicinity,\u201d but it\u2019s doubtful it would have caused a tsunami.\n\nThe chances of an asteroid of this size hitting Earth is \u201conly on the order of once every several thousand years,\u201d Chodas said.", "description": "Internal emails expose how NASA scientists missed what they called the \"largest asteroid\" to \"pass this close to Earth in the last century.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8416c4240000f64a7f28ba.jpeg?cache=1mugl2cmah&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
