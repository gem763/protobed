REUTERS/Sumaya Hisham\n\nThis week ratings agency Moody\u2019s, the last of the top three credit firms to rate South Africa\u2019s debt at investment level, said it had lowered its growth forecast to 0.7% from 1%.\n\nThe central bank sees gross domestic product at 0.6% this year.\n\nBoth have cited slow economic reforms as the key drag on economic activity, and massive bailouts to state-owned companies, including 59 billion rand ($4.05 billion) to power firm Eskom.\n\nThis has limited the government\u2019s scope for stimulus and raised debt while the resultant uncertainty has kept investment subdued.\n\n\u201cThe assumptions underlying the forecasts have clearly changed ... the actual deficit now is probably much higher,\u201d Mboweni told a banking conference in Johannesburg.\n\nHe said that increasing calls for the treasury to bail out state firms was putting pressure on growth and spending.\n\n\u201cWe must re-focus our economy on agriculture \u2026but we also have to continue to support Eskom, because without electricity there is no growth,\u201d Mboweni said.\n\nA Reuters poll of economists this week forecast South African economic growth at 0.7% this year, up from 0.6% in the previous forecast. Second quarter growth bounced back 3.1% after a revised contraction of 3.1% in the first quarter.\n\n($1 = 14.5521 rand)", "description": "South Africa's economic growth is unlikely to reach the treasury's target of 1.5% in 2019 because conditions have changed and the country is facing increasing headwinds, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429401243&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0UM-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
