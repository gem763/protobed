She is believed to have been driving the car and met police afterwards. But no investigation followed after the force was advised she had protective status granted to foreign diplomats.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, flew to the US on Sunday to \u201ccontinue our fight for justice\u201d. A family spokesman said they would only meet Sacoolas if she agreed to return to the UK.\n\nCharles said before boarding her flight she had received a letter from Sacoolas expressing her \u201cdeepest sympathies and apologies\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo be perfectly honest, yes, it\u2019s the start of some closure for our family,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving said that, as it\u2019s nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\nIn an emotional interview with CBS News\u2019 Gayle King, Charles and Dunn questioned why it had taken Sacoolas so long to offer to meet and to offer her condolences and apologise for what she called in a weekend statement \u201cthe tragic accident\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhy has it taken so long?\u201d Charles said. \u201cIt\u2019s seven weeks tomorrow since we lost our boy. We feel that statement should have come from her right at the beginning instead getting on a plane and running home.\u201d\n\nIn her statement, released through her attorney, Sacoolas said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnne would like to meet with Mr Dunn\u2019s parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents told CBS they understood the situation was difficult for Sacoolas and she may not have had the option of remaining in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe realize she may not have have been given any choice as such under this supposed diplomatic immunity cloak \u2013 which we\u2019re not even sure she did have,\u201d Charles said.\n\nTim Dunn gave a harrowing, tearful account of arriving at the scene of the accident to find his son mortally wounded but still conscious.\n\n\u201cThe paramedics were pulling [him] out of the grass verge and putting him on a stretcher. I could see the broken bones sticking out of his arms. He was talking. I called over and said, \u2018Harry, it\u2019s your dad. They\u2019re gonna fix you. Be calm. Let them help you.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe stopped moaning because he was complaining he couldn\u2019t breath very well. He calmed down. A couple of minutes later one of the doctors said they were going to sedate him. I told Harry this was for the best and we\u2019d see him later in hospital. That was the last time \u2026\u201d\n\nAt a subsequent press conference in New York, Charles said: \u201cAll of our grief has gone on hold, it\u2019s coming out in other horrific ways, your legs feel like lead, you\u2019re in pain morning until night that no painkillers can take away.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not able to cry, because we can\u2019t understand this whole situation as to why she would have left us without wanting to meet us back then.\n\n\u201cShe needs to get on the plane and get back to the UK, just do the right thing. It shouldn\u2019t be that difficult, it shouldn\u2019t have been this difficult, she surely didn\u2019t have to go.\u201d\n\nIn her statement, Sacoolas said \u201cno loss compares to the death of a child\u201d and added that she \u201cextends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family\u201d.\n\nHer lawyers said she had cooperated fully with the police. \u201cShe spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to cooperate with the investigation.\n\n\u201cAnne would like to meet with Mr Dunn\u2019s parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident. We have been in contact with the family\u2019s attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Sky News on Monday, Radd Seiger, a spokesman for the parents, said Sacoolas needed to present herself to Northamptonshire police and \u201clet the process go where it may\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very clear there\u2019s not much point in meeting and having pleasantries if that commitment isn\u2019t there,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyers advising Dunn\u2019s family have disputed whether or not Sacoolas ever had a right to diplomatic immunity. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, wrote to them on Saturday to say Sacoolas\u2019s immunity was now irrelevant.", "description": "Parents of teenager killed in road accident say they will only meet US diplomat\u2019s wife if she commits to UK returnHarry Dunn\u2019s parents Charlotte Charles, left, and Tim Dunn, right, with their spokesman Radd Seiger, who has urged Anne Sacoolas to present herself to UK police.
