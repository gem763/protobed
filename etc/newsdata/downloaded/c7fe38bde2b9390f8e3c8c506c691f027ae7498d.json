In 2008, past President Stephen Jones, great-grandson of evangelist and university founder Bob Jones, apologized for BJU\u2019s past racial discrimination.\n\nBut the university hadn\u2019t sought to reinstate its tax-exempt status until 2014 after Steve Pettit took over as the school\u2019s fifth president in its 90-year history.\n\n\u201cOrganizing as a tax-exempt entity is something BJU has needed to do for quite some time,\u201d Pettit said.\n\nIn his first meeting with the university\u2019s Cabinet, Pettit said he believed it was appropriate for BJU to seek its tax-exempt status because the university doesn\u2019t believe the positions it once held about race.\n\nPettit called the university\u2019s racist policies a social issue that was not biblical.\n\n\u201cThe Bible is very clear,\u201d Pettit said as he announced the change to the university Wednesday night. \u201cWe are made of one blood.\u201d\n\nBob Jones University lost its tax exemption after a 13-year battle with the IRS over whether the university\u2019s policies against interracial dating precluded it as a non-taxable religious educational institution. The university didn\u2019t admit any black students until 1971, 17 years after Brown vs. Board of Education. It then wouldn\u2019t admit any students who were in a mixed-race marriage and created rules to prohibit students from interracial dating.\n\nThe case rose to the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS could revoke the university\u2019s tax-exempt status because the government\u2019s interest in eradicating racial discrimination from education overrode the university\u2019s First Amendment rights to religious free speech.\n\nThe case has been cited many times through the years. Most recently, it arose in an exchange before the Supreme Court in the Obergefell vs. Hodges decision, which legalized gay marriage. After that decision, the IRS commissioner said the agency would not target the tax-exempt status of religious institutions that oppose gay marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s taken two-and-a-half years for BJU to accomplish the reorganization because it used a complicated plan to split its organization into two entities with the university falling under the umbrella of its elementary school\u2019s existing non-profit status to achieve its own, according to university statements and organization documents filed with the South Carolina Secretary of State and the IRS.\n\nThat existing nonprofit was called Bob Jones Elementary School, Inc. until last May, when it was renamed BJU, Inc.\n\nThe restructuring came after \u201cconsultation with legal counsel and accountants with many years of experience in assisting tax exempt organizations\u2014as well as input from members of the BJU community and our congressional delegation,\u201d Pettit said.\n\nThe change didn\u2019t require IRS approval because its elementary school was already a nonprofit, though the university had formal correspondence and conversations with the IRS, said Randy Page, BJU spokesman.\n\nThe university is now listed as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit on the IRS website, said Michael Dobzinski, IRS spokesman.\n\nWhat it means\n\nUntil now, if members of the community or alumni wanted to donate to the university, their gifts were only tax deductible if they gave to certain nonprofit arms of the university, such as its scholarship fund, art museum or athletic foundation.\n\nDonors couldn\u2019t give tax-deductible gifts to the university itself to help with capital campaigns or for university initiatives.\n\nMost of the large gifts to the university recently, like a $500,000 gift from the Sargant Foundation in December and a $1 million anonymous gift announced last November, went toward its BJU Scholarship Fund, a nonprofit entity of the university.\n\nNow donors\u2019 gifts will be tax-deductible, Page said.\n\n\u201cIt helps when you\u2019re trying to raise money for an organization to have a tax-exempt status,\u201d Page said. \u201cThat obviously helps your advancement folks, your development folks and those in the community \u2013 companies, individuals, alumni \u2013 to make it easier to donate to a nonprofit.\u201d\n\nThe change wouldn\u2019t affect students\u2019 scholarships or grants and wouldn\u2019t affect employees, he said.\n\nThe change levels the playing field between the university and other sister institutions when applying for grants, he said.\n\nIt also moves BJU from a for-profit college to a nonprofit classification with the U.S. Department of Education, \u201cwhich is frequently perceived more favorably by the public,\u201d Page said.\n\nThat change could prove important as the U.S. Department of Education has targeted for-profit colleges with added oversight in recent years and fined several for-profit networks of colleges under the Obama administration, which resulted in colleges like Corinthian College and ITT Technical Institute closing down.\n\nAnd though the university operates debt-free and doesn\u2019t plan to take on debt, it could potentially save through lower interest rates if it chose to take on debt, Page said.\n\nHow BJU will be structured\n\nOn March 1, Bob Jones University, Inc. will be renamed Bob Jones Education Group, Inc. and will remain the university\u2019s taxable entity and will donate about half its assets to the non-taxable BJU, Inc.\n\nThe university\u2019s assets will effectively be split between the two organizations.\n\nBJU, Inc. will include the university and most of its facilities, the art museum, elementary school and child development center. BJU Press writers also will come under the umbrella of BJU, Inc.\n\nThe for-profit arm of the university \u2013 Bob Jones Education Group, Inc. \u2013 will include the BJU Press, University Cleaners and the Bob Jones Academy middle and high schools.\n\nThe university will still be governed by its 25-member Board of Trustees. The board will appoint a new eight-member board to govern Bob Jones Education Group.\n\nThe transition process began in late 2014 with a study of how to achieve tax exemption. Last May 5, the Board of Trustees approved the final plan for pursuing tax exemption and the administration has been working to implement it since then.\n\nAt the same time, the university has been seeking regional accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. The university, which is listed as a candidate for accreditation, notified the commission of its potential changes, which wouldn\u2019t affect its candidacy, Page said.\n\nThe university presented SACSCOC with its proposal plan for tax exemption and there is no change in governance, said Pamela Cravey, SACSCOC spokeswoman.\n\n\"The action was an IRS matter and did not constitute a substantive change,\" Cravey said,\n\nSACSCOC has considered the university as a not-for-profit, she said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2lcx0Fi", "description": "Bob Jones University has regained its tax-exempt status with the IRS", "authors": ["Nathaniel Cary", "Published P.M.
