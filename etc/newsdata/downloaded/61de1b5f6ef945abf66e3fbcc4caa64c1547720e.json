Hit it hard\u2026Oh man, strike out.\u2019\n\nThe soon-to-be father musters up his best swing and gives the balloon a hard smack, but it still doesn\u2019t burst. Instead it becomes untethered and begins floating away without revealing its contents.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAs the balloon makes it\u2019s great escape, the man initially does not notice.
