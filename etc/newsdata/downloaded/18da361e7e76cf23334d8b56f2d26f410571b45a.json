Many young men today have little to bring to the marriage bargain, especially as young women\u2019s educational levels on average now exceed their male suitors.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, official figures showed that marriages between men and women in England and Wales had fallen to a record low.\n\nThere were 239,020 marriages between opposite-sex couples in 2015, the latest year that figures were available for, a drop by more than 8,300 or a decrease of 3.4 per cent from the previous year.\n\nIn 2014 when there 247,372 marriages, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which released the data.\n\n\u201cEighty years ago people got married, in part, because society expected them to,\u201c said Chris Sherwood, chief executive at relationship support charity Relate.\n\n\u201dThese same societal pressures don\u2019t exist today and it\u2019s to be celebrated that people now have far greater choice around how they form, structure and manage their relationships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also possible that many people are now prioritising other things over getting married, such as education, starting a family, buying a house and going travelling. This could also be a reason for the rising average age of marriage.\n\nSherwood added that \u201cthe rising cost of marriage\u201d could also be a deterrent.\n\nThe average wedding in the UK costs approximately \u00a332,273, according to Hitched.co.uk, the UK\u2019s largest wedding website.\n\nThe figure stands at an all-time high, up by \u00a35,112 \u2013 or 19 per cent \u2013 from \u00a327,161 the previous year.", "description": "A shortage of \u201ceconomically-attractive\u201d men could be to blame for the decline in marriage rates, according to new research.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/10/12/women-friends.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
