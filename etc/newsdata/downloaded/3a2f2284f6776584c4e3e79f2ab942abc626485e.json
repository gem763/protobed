It turns out we live pretty close to each other in LA so we mostly spoke about that.\n\n\u2018I saw him rehearsing and he\u2019s a national treasure. The music team has done a really good job of nailing everyone\u2019s strengths and his performance is perfect for him.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIn the auditions, Kevin admitted that he was \u2018a bag of nerves\u2019 after he didn\u2019t receive the best reviews from the judges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk he explained: \u2018I wasn\u2019t expecting a bigger reaction at all, I was honestly happy to just get through it.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t think my performance was that great but I think more than anything I was proud to not have completely botched it. I am a bit rusty I haven\u2019t performed live since the Glee tour in 2011.\n\n\u2018I think everyone is going to be really surprised because from the judge\u2019s houses to what we are doing in the first week, it\u2019s going to be a completely different show. Everyone has stepped it up.\u2019\n\nKevin is through to the live shows (Picture: David Fisher/REX)\n\nThe 31-year-old who shot to fame in 2009 when he took on the role of disabled school student Artie Abrams revealed that despite his background in music, he doesn\u2019t have an \u2018advantage\u2019 on the other contestants.\n\n\u2018No I honestly don\u2019t think that,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018I think I am the one most known to have done music in my past but if anyone takes anything from the first episode they will know that everyone is on an even playing ground.\n\nKevin as Artie in Glee (Picture: Patrick Ecclesine/Fox-Tv/Kobal/REX)\n\n\u2018In Glee, there were 80 of us and in the Glee tour, I think I only sang two songs. It is a really different thing to be out there by myself and I understand how it comes off that I might have an advantage but just know I don\u2019t feel that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin, who also hosted E4 show, Virtually Famous after his stint on Glee admitted that he is at the stage where he\u2019s waking up \u2018in the middle of the night\u2019 thinking about the song he\u2019s singing.\n\n\u2018I just want to get on and do it now,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018With the first sho,w there\u2019s been a lot of prep so I am just excited that I\u2019ll get to perform.\n\n\u2018At the moment it doesn\u2019t feel like a competition, maybe it will when people start to go home. I think it\u2019s hard to compare yourself to other people at this point but maybe my competition is myself because as I can do is control what I do on the night.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
