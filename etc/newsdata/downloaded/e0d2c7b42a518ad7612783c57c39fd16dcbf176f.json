However, Britain could still leave the EU on October 31.\n\nThe government intends to bring forward the ratifying law on Monday, and it could still pass parliament by the end of the month.\n\nAddressing the lower House of Commons ahead of the vote, Johnson said further delay would be \u201cpointless, expensive and deeply corrosive to public trust\u201d.\n\nHe said his deal would be a \u201cnew way forward and a new and better deal both for Britain and our friends in the EU\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Free country\u2019 \u2013\n\nSecuring a deal was a personal victory for Johnson, a figurehead in the 2016 Leave campaign who has vowed to deliver Brexit on October 31 come what may.\n\nBut parliament \u2014 like the frustrated public \u2014 is still bitterly divided over how and even if Britain should end almost half a century of integration with its closest neighbours.\n\nThe debate coincided with a mass demonstration to parliament demanding a second referendum, with an option to reverse Brexit.\n\nInside parliament, many hardline eurosceptic MPs in Johnson\u2019s Conservative party offered their support.\n\nMP Mark Francois added: \u201cIf the House of Commons votes for this today, within a fortnight we\u2019ll be living in a free country.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Sell-out deal\u2019 \u2013\n\nJohnson took office in July after his predecessor Theresa May failed three times to get her own divorce deal through parliament.\n\nHe insists that Brexit must happen this month to end the uncertainty that has weighed on the economy and dominated political and public debate.\n\nHowever, the vote rests on a knife-edge.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Johnson\u2019s minority government, said it will vote against the agreement because of its arrangements for the British province.\n\nThe main opposition Labour party says the deal lacks sufficient protections for environmental and workers\u2019 rights, and puts Britain on a path to a loose trading relationship with the EU after Brexit that could hit the economy.\n\n\u201cWe will not back this sell-out deal,\u201d leftist leader Jeremy Corbyn said.\n\nHe added: \u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Sick and tired\u2019 \u2013\n\nNot far from parliament, thousands of protesters gathered for a demonstration demanding a new referendum, with an option to reverse Brexit or at least have a say on Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\n\u201cThe first referendum was jumping on a train without a destination. Now that we have a destination, we need to have a second referendum,\u201d said Douglas Hill, 35, on the march with his Estonian wife.\n\nAn online Survation poll of 1,025 adults on Thursday and Friday for the Daily Mail found that 50 percent said MPs should vote for the deal, while 38 percent said not.\n\nEU leaders in Brussels this week urged lawmakers to back the deal to allow both sides to move on to discussing their future relationship.\n\nThe deal covers Britain\u2019s financial settlement, protects the rights of EU citizens and sets out a post-Brexit transition period potentially until 2022 to allow both sides to agree new trade terms.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Prime Minister Boris Johnson fought attempts Saturday to potentially further delay Britain\u2019s protracted departure from the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/387812_britain-prime-minister-boris-johnson-brexit-delay-pointless-deeply-corrosive-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
