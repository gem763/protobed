The project is expected to exceed the Company\u2019s required internal rate of return with profitable production and mine life extending beyond 2040.\n\nNewmont Goldcorp to Add Profitable Gold Production through Second Expansion at Tanami in Australia\n\n\u201cThe approval of our second expansion project at Tanami in Australia will further improve costs and extend the life of this world class mine in a core Newmont Goldcorp jurisdiction,\u201d said Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cBuilding on the success of the first expansion completed in 2017, Tanami Expansion 2 will provide a platform to further explore the area\u2019s prolific mineral endowment and potentially extend the operation\u2019s mine life beyond 2040. The Tanami district and Australia as a whole continue to offer significant value generating opportunities for our shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe Tanami expansion project is anchored on the expansive Auron deposit, which was discovered in 2008, and is located stratigraphically beneath the original Callie orebody and, more recently, the follow up discoveries of Federation and Liberator. Tanami\u2019s prolific orebodies are hosted by reactive stratigraphic units where high-grade gold mineralization is found at intersections with structural corridors. These predictable geologic features, combined with recent drilling results, provide a high degree of confidence in their continuity at depth.\n\nThe expansion includes construction of a 1,460 meter shaft, additional capacity in the processing plant, and supporting infrastructure to enable profitable recovery of ore at depth to 2,140 meters below surface. Additional information on the project will be provided with the Company\u2019s long-term outlook in early December.\n\nThe advancement of Tanami Expansion 2 into the execution phase represents a new and significant milestone for the operation. Since mining commenced in 1986, Tanami has produced more than 10 million ounces of gold and, in 2018, the operation achieved record production of 505,000 ounces. Tanami is located 590 miles southwest of Darwin and 350 miles northwest of Alice Springs in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory.\n\nNewmont Goldcorp has the strongest and most sustainable portfolio of operations, projects and exploration prospects in the gold sector. These assets allow the Company to sequence profitable projects in its unmatched pipeline to sustain six to seven million ounces of steady gold production over a decades-long time horizon.\n\nAbout Newmont Goldcorp\n\nNewmont Goldcorp is the world\u2019s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.
