Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, hailed SB 2\u2019s passage, saying his measure would \u201chelp slow the growth of future property tax bill increases.\u201d\n\nBut Galveston County Tax Assessor-Collector Cheryl Johnson said promises of reform and relief are exaggerated.\n\n\u201cThere is no tax relief in this bill. SB2 is a waste of time for individual homeowners,\u201d declared Johnson, who compiled the study.\n\n\u201cTwenty-one million homeowners will see no relief from SB 2,\u201d she told Watchdog in an interview.\n\nIf Johnson\u2019s assessment is correct, SB 2 could haunt state Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, for again failing to deliver substantive property-tax relief.\n\nAmid much fanfare, the 2015 Legislature raised the homestead exemption with promises of lower levies, but property tax bills continue to soar.\n\nJohnson said the Republican-dominated Legislature\u2019s piecemeal approach is doomed to fail.\n\n\u201cSB 2 is only one piece of the puzzle, and the GOP will lose elections because of this,\u201d predicted Johnson, a Republican.\n\nUntil appraisals are capped, Johnson said tax bills will keep climbing. So she recommends a complete overhaul.\n\nLawmakers should \u201cfreeze everything and rewrite the [tax] code,\u201d said Johnson, who favors a \u201cprice-paid\u201d appraisal system to effectively freeze residential taxes while transferring commercial/industrial appraisal responsibilities to the state comptroller.\n\n\u201cThat would spread the wealth across the state and equalize education funding. Then we\u2019re done,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get a cap bill, do [legislators] want to come back in two years and do it all over again? It\u2019s time to man up,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nLawmakers appear more interested in nibbling around the margins, however.\n\nJust before the clock struck midnight, the Senate Finance Committee lifted the lid on tax revenue increases from 4 percent to 5 percent to conform to a softer bill in the House \u2014 further eroding whatever small savings taxpayers might receive.\n\nKenric Ward writes for the Texas Bureau of Watchdog.org.
