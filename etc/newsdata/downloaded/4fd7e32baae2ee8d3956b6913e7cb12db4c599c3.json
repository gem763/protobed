The three holdouts were exactly whom you\u2019d expect: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney. But their delay in joining the effort didn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019d ultimately refuse. Recall that the three retiring GOP members of the caucus, Lamar Alexander, Mike Enzi, and Johnny Isakson, also took longer than the rest to declare their support for the resolution. But in the end, all three did.\n\nNot Collins and Murkowski, though. They\u2019re now on record: Count them out. Presumably the same goes for Mitt. Granted, the fact that they\u2019re all declining to sponsor the resolution doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they won\u2019t vote for it if it comes to the floor, but if you\u2019re going to absorb the political pain from your own base that comes with criticizing Graham\u2019s bill, why then turn around and absorb pain from the other party\u2019s voters by supporting it?\n\nPresumably all three would vote no, which means Graham\u2019s resolution wouldn\u2019t carry a clear majority of the Republican-controlled chamber. The question now: Will the Senate actually vote on Graham\u2019s resolution at all?\n\n\u201cI have been critical of the House not holding a vote to authorize the inquiry, but the House determines its own procedures,\u201d Collins said, who has not decided whether or not she would vote for the resolution if it came to the floor. \u201cJust as I don\u2019t like it when House members try to tell us to abolish the filibuster, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s productive for the Senate to try to dictate to the House how to conduct the inquiry.\u201d\n\nMurkowski took the same line in her own statement, insisting that she dislikes how Pelosi has handled things but that the Senate should mind its own business:\n\nNEW Sen @lisamurkowski stmt RE: not signing onto Senate GOP resolution condemning House impeachment process: \u201cAs awful as their process is, the formal impeachment inquiry lies in the House, and it\u2019s not the Senate\u2019s role to dictate to the House how to determine their own rules.\u201d pic.twitter.com/9gEQ1DXkR9 \u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 29, 2019\n\nRomney, meanwhile, raised an interesting point in wondering whether the resolution was still necessary. \u201c[I]t looks like Speaker Pelosi has scheduled a vote so that may be overtaken by events,\u201d he told Politico, which is correct \u2014 partly. One of the complaints in the text of Graham\u2019s resolution is that prior attempts to impeach a U.S. president began with a formal floor vote in the House authorizing impeachment proceedings. Pelosi announced yesterday afternoon that that vote will now happen belatedly. Does Graham still want to go forward with his resolution?\n\nI\u2019m guessing yeah. After all, he introduced the resolution in the first place to try to appease Trump and his inner circle amid complaints that he\u2019s not using his power as Judiciary Committee chairman to investigate the Burisma matter. The resolution was his way of throwing them a bone, doing a little PR for the White House by attacking the Democrats\u2019 investigation. He\u2019ll be eager to follow through on that in order to keep Trump off his back on the Bidens. Plus, it\u2019s not as if the upcoming House vote answers all of the grievances laid out in his resolution. The text also complains that Democrats haven\u2019t afforded Trump due process by letting his lawyers confront witnesses and haven\u2019t played fair with the House GOP by letting them subpoena people. Those criticisms are still viable, at least for now.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t whether Graham wants to proceed with the resolution, it\u2019s whether McConnell does. He\u2019s also a co-sponsor, of course, but Politico finds it telling that McConnell hasn\u2019t yet scheduled a floor vote on the bill. Instead he dumped it on the Senate Rules Committee, where it\u2019s apt to be bogged down for weeks, and then could be bogged down for weeks after that if/when Democrats start using procedural gimmicks to obstruct it. By the time it\u2019s ready for a vote the House may have already voted to impeach. America will be in trial mode. No one will care about Graham\u2019s resolution anymore.\n\nWhich, I take it, would be fine with McConnell. As always, he\u2019s worried first and foremost about the incumbents in his caucus and only secondarily about Trump. If he can spare the five most vulnerable Republicans in the chamber \u2014 Collins, Gardner, Ernst, Tillis, and McSally \u2014 from a tough and ultimately unnecessary vote, he\u2019ll look for ways to do it. The latter four have already taken a minor political risk by informally endorsing the resolution in order to signal to Republican voters back home that they\u2019re on the team. If McConnell can now make the resolution go away without a formal vote, so much the better. I bet that\u2019s what\u2019ll happen.\n\nExit question: Does having Romney around as a lightning rod for Trump\u2019s criticism make it easier for Collins and Murky to defy the president? Anytime they join with Mitt on something that makes the White House unhappy, you know which of them will be the target of the pissy tweets that inevitably follow.", "description": "\"t's not the Senate's role to dictate to the House how to determine their own rules.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/m-10.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
