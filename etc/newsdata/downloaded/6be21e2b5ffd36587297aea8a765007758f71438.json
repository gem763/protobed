And many of the world\u2019s best-armed countries are acquiring them. China, Russia, India, Brazil, the U.K., France, America.\n\nBut just getting your hands on a flattop is hardly enough. For every example of a country that succeeds in deploying a functional carrier and matching air wing, there\u2019s a counter-example: a flattop hobbled by mechanical problems, stricken by age, sidelined by bad design or stuck with warplanes that simply don\u2019t work.\n\nWhat follows are not the success stories. They are the case studies in flattop failure \u2026 and object lessons for all the countries building aircraft carriers today.\n\nMother Russia\u2019s tugboat bait\n\nThe Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia\u2019s only aircraft carrier, was launched in 1985 and joined the fleet in 1991. Since then the 55,000-ton, fossil-fuel-powered flattop has managed just four frontline deployments\u2014all of them to the Mediterranean, and all of them just a few months in duration.\n\nBy contrast, American flattops typically deploy for at least six months every two years. The nuclear-powered USS Enterprise, commissioned in 1962, completed 25 deployments before leaving service in 2012.\n\nOne of Admiral Kuznetsov\u2019s major problems is her powerplant. The vessel is powered by steam turbines and turbo-pressurized boilers that Defense Industry Daily generously described as \u201cdefective.\u201d Anticipating breakdowns, large ocean-going tugs accompany Admiral Kuznetsov whenever she deploys.\n\nPoor maintenance makes life difficult and dangerous for Admiral Kuznetsov\u2019s 1,900 sailors. A short circuit started a fire off Turkey in 2009 that killed one seaman.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Not worth their weight.", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7Olf6WayktXjQNiikQQ1hw--~B/aD03MTM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/e9145ade38aec7e0a0182efd026d65f4", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
