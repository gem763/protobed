I think their ego is actually forcing them to go out there and do it.\u201d\n\nThe likes of Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Haney have been confirmed for the card, and Haye believes that the event will be of benefit to them both.\n\n\u201cIf it encourages a different demographic to tune in to a different pay-per-view event, then that helps the sport of boxing.\n\n\u201cIt genuinely helps every other fighter on the undercard, they\u2019re getting paid at pay-per-view, the show wouldn\u2019t be that without Logan Paul and KSI.\n\n\u201cWith KSI and Logan Paul fighting it just then puts more money in the pot for these other boxers, so I think it\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u201cHaney could fight on his own card in his own hometown, but with what television and ticket sales?\n\n\u201cHe could do that and have his face as the main picture but he would get paid significantly less.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll probably fight on this card and get paid five times more than he normally would.\u201d", "description": "David Haye\u00a0says that the upcoming fight between YouTube sensations KSI and Logan Paul is a \u2018good thing\u2019 for boxing.
