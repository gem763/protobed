Monday for me was the worst day.\n\n\"Every week learning a new dance, I really really struggled on Monday. It sounds odd but I just felt like a failure because I couldn't get the simplest of steps right.\"\n\nHe added: \"It was like, what am I gonna do? Tuesday I improved a little bit, and Wednesday I improved.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\"Thursday felt like I went backwards, I panicked on Friday and suddenly on Saturday we got two 10s!\"\n\nHost Rylan Clark-Neal joked his weekly update sounded like a new Craig David song, similar to 7 Days.\n\nHe then added that the couple's score was the highest week three score ever on the series - not including series 12 when there were five judges on the panel for that week.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nSign up for our Strictly updates Love Strictly?

I've very much forgotten about that now.\n\n\"[The Rumba is] a very different dance with a completely different pace. It's so slow!\"\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues live on Saturday at 6:40pm on BBC One.", "description": "Actor Kelvin Fletcher was worried just days before he wowed the Strictly Come Dancing judges last weekend", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562606.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_kelvin-and-oti-on-ITT-felt-like-a-failure-ahead-of-high-week-3-score-everseries.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
