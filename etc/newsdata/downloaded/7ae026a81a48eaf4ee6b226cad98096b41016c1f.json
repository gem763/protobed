In English, \"right\" also means \"to be right\".\n\n\"What this study shows is that being left-handed is just a consequence of the developmental biology of the brain, it has nothing to do with luck or maliciousness,\" Prof Furniss said.\n\n\"And it is driven at least in part by genetic variants we've discovered.\n\n\"This adds to the understanding of what makes us human.\"\n\nIs this the end of the story?\n\nFar from it.\n\nThe best guess is handedness is 25% genetic and 75% down to the environment (anything that's not in the genes).\n\nYet this study has found only the first 1% of that genetic component and only in a British population.\n\nSo, much more work is needed to understand the genetic component of handedness in people across the globe, never mind what the huge environmental effects are, and then piece together how those elements result in people being either left or right handed.\n\nFollow James on Twitter.", "description": "Scientists start to chip away at the mystery of why one in 10 people is left-handed.", "authors": ["James Gallagher", "Health", "Science Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/144B1/production/_108612138_gettyimages-1157094585.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
