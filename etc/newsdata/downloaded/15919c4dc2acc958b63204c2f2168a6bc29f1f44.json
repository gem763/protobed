Right: Toby Darling (Andrew Burnap) in part two of The Inheritance. Photo: Everett Collection/Shutterstock/Matthew Murphy\n\n\u201cI consider this the ultimate in fan-fiction, basically,\u201d Matthew Lopez says of his play The Inheritance, a two-part, nearly seven-hour gay drama set in New York circa 2016 that came here from London, where it won numerous awards. Considering the whole epic, two-part gay-drama thing, people have been quick to compare it to Angels in America, though the impulse behind The Inheritance really lay in Lopez\u2019s desire to take his favorite novel, Howards End, and \u201cqueer it.\u201d Or possibly, given that the author, E. M. Forster, was gay, make it come out of the closet. Lopez updates the 1910 novel, which you may also know from the Oscar-winning 1992 Merchant Ivory movie with Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins, to accommodate a story about three generations of gay men in New York. The class dynamics of Edwardian Londoners who attend Beethoven concerts and vacation in the countryside and care oh so much about real estate have been transformed into the class divisions of gay New Yorkers who spend their time at the Strand and go to Fire Island and, yes, care very much about real estate. (One character unveils a key to Gramercy Park like it\u2019s a holy relic.) Lopez wanted to know, he says, \u201cHow faithful can you be to the novel while simultaneously blowing it up?\u201d For those who know Howards End well and need an intro to the gay New York of The Inheritance (or vice versa), the playwright walks a few key lines of comparison between the two.\n\nThe Privileged Intellectual\n\n\u27bd The main character of Forster\u2019s novel, Margaret Schlegel, is an upper-middle-class intellectual who lives in a London townhouse that\u2019s about to be demolished and who likes to get her friends together to debate art and politics. The play\u2019s Eric Glass is a secular Jewish graduate of Fieldston and Yale (\u201cI gave him a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9!,\u201d Lopez says) who pays $575 a month for his rent-controlled Upper West Side apartment. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who doesn\u2019t come from wealth per se,\u201d Lopez says, \u201cbut he does enjoy a middle-class white privilege.\u201d That\u2019s \u201cso far away from my experience but also a character that everyone who lives in New York City knows and understands.\u201d\n\nThe Cunning, Charming Beauty\n\n\u27bd Margaret\u2019s younger sister, Helen Schlegel, is flighty, fond of odd causes, and, Lopez believes, the real villain of the novel \u201cbecause she doesn\u2019t take responsibility for her actions, and her actions are very damaging.\u201d He turned Helen into Eric\u2019s emotional, secretive, very hot playwright boyfriend Toby Darling, a self-destructive addict who resembles a certain type of self-made gay man who can be \u201ccaring and thoughtful and charming, and then at the next moment be so cunning and cruel.\u201d Lopez gives Toby the comeuppance he feels Helen needs \u2014 ironic, since this is the character he most identifies with in some ways. \u201cIt\u2019s fucked up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThe Conservative Patriarch\n\n\u27bd The one main character who keeps the same name, Henry Wilcox, British capitalist, becomes Henry Wilcox, American real-estate magnate. Both are superrich members of an older generation who happen to be conservative for their time and who develop a close relationship with the Margaret/Eric character in a way that shocks her/his friends. Lopez likes some of the discomfort that comes across in those scenes: \u201cWe yell at each other, we argue with each other, but we\u2019ve forgotten how to talk to each other across differences.\u201d\n\nThe Keeper of the Past\n\n\u27bd A stand-in for the spirit of old England in the novel, Ruth Wilcox is Henry\u2019s wife and the first of the older generation to befriend Margaret. In the play, Ruth becomes Walter Poole, who befriends Eric and speaks directly about his own gay history and memories of the AIDS epidemic. Ruth owns Howards End, a family home that\u2019s key to the novel, while Walter has a home upstate, which is key to the play, as we learn he nursed many dying AIDS patients there. \u201cIn figuring out Walter, I figured out the house,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cWhen I figured out the house, I understood how in writing about generations of gay men I would deal with the epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe Working-Class Artist\n\n\u27bd Completing Forster\u2019s upper-, middle-, and lower-class taxonomy, there\u2019s Leonard Bast, a poor clerk with an artistic sensibility whom Helen keeps trying to save with disastrous results. In The Inheritance, there\u2019s a pair of Leonard-like characters, both played by the same actor, who get entangled with Toby: Adam, a young actor, and Leo, a sex worker. In fact, there\u2019s a bit of Leonard in Toby, too, as we eventually discover. \u201cMaybe why Helen and Leonard get so intertwined and blurred in the play,\u201d Lopez says, \u201cis because I probably have spent my life feeling a little like Leonard Bast and a little like Helen Schlegel.\u201d\n\nThat House\n\nPhoto: Merchant Ivory/Kobal/Shutterstock/Merchant Ivory/Kobal/Shutterstoc\n\n\u27bd Like any good novel about class, Howards End is filled with details about where everyone lives and how well they live. In The Inheritance, we see many of the same details: Howards End itself becomes Walter\u2019s home upstate (originally, Lopez had wanted to set it on Fire Island but decided he wanted a location away from the AIDS epidemic); the modern Henry has a place in the Hamptons; and Eric moves to a place with Gramercy Park access thanks to Henry. New York audiences in particular gasp when they learn about Eric\u2019s low rent: \u201cAs they say in the novel, the English don\u2019t really have mythology, only fairies and stuff. New York City mythology is rent control.\u201d\n\nThe Great Debates\n\n\u27bd Margaret spends a lot of Howards End gathering people together to debate the issues of the day. A part when she brings Ruth to lunch with her argumentative friends has now become Eric bringing Walter to brunch (of course) with his argumentative friends. \u201cHow do you take that scene with a bunch of Edwardians and turn it into a scene with a bunch of contemporary older millennial and Gen-Z characters?,\u201d Lopez asks. The book\u2019s characters debate women\u2019s suffrage and Teddy Roosevelt, while the play\u2019s ensemble of gay men debates the state of gay culture, Grindr, and even the use of \u201cyass queen.\u201d \u201cThat dynamic of generations and classes colliding \u2014 that was really interesting to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly Connect\u201d\n\n\u27bd If you know one phrase from Howards End, it\u2019s this, which is how Margaret articulates her philosophy. Lopez didn\u2019t get the famous \u201conly connect\u201d speech itself into the play (neither did Merchant Ivory), saying \u201cit felt too on the nose,\u201d but he believes he captured its spirit in a scene when Eric invites friends to Henry\u2019s place and the conversation turns sour over his politics. Given that the scene centers on a debate about a rich, conservative donor, would it today be about boycotting Equinox? \u201cThat\u2019s just so boring to me as drama,\u201d he says. \u201cA boycott is literally a refusal to engage. That scene has to be about the willingness to engage.\u201d\n\nThe Inheritance is at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.\n\n*This article appears in the October 28, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
