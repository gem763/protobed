Whichever way you look at this firm \u2013 either as an investor or customer (particularly sellers) \u2013 it looks like a business in crisis.\n\nFloated on the UK stock market just over a year ago, the shares have tanked more than 70 per cent in value in the past 12 months in response to continued losses (\u00a330.8 million in the first six months of this year).\n\nIndeed, the company\u2019s share price performance has been so appalling it has been jettisoned from the FTSE 250 Index. A closing share price of \u00a31.06 on Friday compares with a flotation price in September last year of \u00a34.40.\n\nFunding Circle founder and chief executive Samir Desai\n\nIn August, co-founder and chief executive Samir Desai preferred (understandably) to gloss over some of the alarming financial numbers, instead talking about \u2018strong repeat dynamics from borrowers\u2019 (que?) and his aim to turn Funding Circle into the \u2018world\u2019s largest small business loans provider\u2019.\n\nAn admirable aim \u2013 but mere words. \u2018Small businesses remain underserved,\u2019 Desai said (no problem with that statement, he\u2019s dead right). \u2018Our platform allows them to access the finance they need in a fast and affordable way, whilst at the same time opening up a stable and attractive asset class to a broad range of investors.\u2019 (Here, I\u2019m not so sure).\n\nSeven years ago, I invested \u00a3200 with Funding Circle. I did it as a personal finance experiment \u2013 to see whether peer-to-peer lending passed muster as a new asset class, sitting somewhere between cash and shares on the risk scale.\n\nOn one level, I\u2019ve done OK. My \u00a3200, invested across a broad range of businesses, has grown in value to \u00a3270.21.\n\nThere have been a few bad debts along the way \u2013 businesses failing, resulting in the loss of the money I\u2019ve lent them and the stream of interest payments I was due \u2013 but I\u2019ve done better than if I had stuck the \u00a3200 in a savings account with a high street bank.\n\nBut my \u00a3270.21 is not as accessible or attainable as I thought it would be. Far from it. Late last month, I thought I would sever my relationship with Funding Circle (experiment over) and put my money to use elsewhere (Premium Bonds).\n\nYet getting money back is like pulling teeth. I have two options.First, I can \u2018turn off\u2019 my lending and allow the business loans I have made to run their course.\n\nThis means I will receive my money back through a series of monthly repayments. But this will take forever \u2013 more than five years \u2013 and, of course, some of the loans could go bad in the meantime.\n\nIn other words, I may not get back \u00a3270.21. Alternatively, I can ask Funding Circle to find a buyer for my loans. The price for pursuing this route is that I will only receive an \u2018estimated\u2019 \u00a3246.72. Also, it could take four months or more before I get my money (this detail was only forthcoming after I pressed the company for it).\n\nOn Friday, Funding Circle told me it was looking to improve the way investors can access their funds. Too right it should be. At the moment, its business model does not treat sellers fairly. No wonder its share price remains in the doldrums.\n\nHave you had problems investing in peer-to-peer lenders?
