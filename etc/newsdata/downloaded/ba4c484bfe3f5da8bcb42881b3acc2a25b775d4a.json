Moss, a Washington-based lawyer specializing in national security, told Insider, \"Quite simply, the whistleblower did not submit a transcript ... they submitted a complaint, and we do not yet know the full universe of information, allegations, and claims that were actually outlined in that complaint.\"\n\nMuch of what is known about the complaint so far comes from \"fragmented leaks\" to the press from people who likely have agendas of their own, Moss said, and to \"rely strictly on these anonymous leaks as the basis to conclude this was all about one phone call would be political and legal malpractice.\"\n\nExpressing similar sentiments, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday tweeted, \"The transcript of the call will show us the tip of the iceberg. It's clear the scope of this corruption is much deeper than a phone call. That's why we need the whistleblower complaint and a full inquiry.\"\n\n'No foreign leaders in future will speak candidly with the president'\n\nFormer US officials are also warning that releasing the transcript sets a bad precedent for future conversations between US presidents and foreign leaders, and that from a legal standpoint Congress should have access to the complaint.\n\nResponding to Trump's announcement on releasing the trascrnipt, former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul on Tuesday tweeted: \"This is a big mistake \u2014 terrible precedent, as no foreign leaders in future will speak candidly with the president on any future calls. Dont release Trump-Zelensky or Trump-Putin transcripts of calls. Instead, release whistleblower's complaint to Congress, as required by law.\"\n\nRead more: A mysterious exchange between Trump and a foreign leader is Washington's latest obsession. Here's what's actually going on.\n\nIn the phone call, Trump reportedly urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, multiple times. Congressional lawmakers are concerned he dangled military aid over Ukraine as a quid pro quo for it to launch a probe into a political opponent, though it is still unclear.\n\nTrump has acknowledged he spoke to Zelensky about investigating Biden and that he moved to hold back roughly $400 million in military aid from Ukraine about a week before the call, but he denies doing anything unethical.\n\nThe complaint was filed by an intelligence official on August 12, about two weeks after Trump's call with Zelensky.\n\nIntelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG), Michael Atkinson, determined the whistleblower's complaint to be credible and of \"urgent concern\" and two weeks after receiving it, he submitted it to Maguire.\n\nFederal law requires the DNI to communicate or transmit complaints of \"urgent concern\" to Congress within seven days, but Maguire did not do this.\n\nThe Trump administration's stonewalling has once again placed the White House at odds with Democrats when it comes to congressional oversight, and has also led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to formally announce an impeachment inquiry.", "description": "Legal and national security experts, members of Congress, and former US officials warn that the release of the transcript does not go far enough.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a8b872e22af187c583545?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
