This Couple Rescues Them.", "language": "en", "text": "When Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina in 2018, Jay Yontz and Kristin Hartness \u201csaw a lot of really morbid, somber things.\u201d The couple owns an animal sanctuary, and during the hurricane\u2019s catastrophic flooding, they risked their lives to save dozens of creatures. Among those saved were a litter of puppies trapped on a porch. But, as Yontz and Hartness will tell you, the vast majority of animals that perish in hurricanes aren\u2019t pets\u2014they\u2019re farm animals, abandoned and left to drown in factory farms. Shawn Bannon\u2019s short documentary Hurricane Heroes follows Hartness and Yontz as they embark on a series of breathtaking rescue operations to save the animals society has left behind.\n\nAccording to Bannon, the official number of farm animals that died during Florence is 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 pigs. \u201cBut most people I talked to said it was a lot higher than that,\u201d he told me. \u201cFrom what I've heard, a lot of farm animals were washed away by the hurricane, so they were not included in this number.\u201d\n\nThe fact that many of the animals rescued were bred for consumption does not influence the couple\u2019s perspective on the necessity of their work.\n\n\u201cJust because someone doesn\u2019t have the same attachment to pigs, doesn\u2019t mean [pigs] don\u2019t feel the same things your dog does,\u201d says Yontz in the film.\n\n\u201cThey want to live, they want to love, and they want to be loved,\u201d adds Hartness.\n\nThe couple would know\u2014they adopted two of the pigs they rescued. Today, Flo and Jax are happy pets that live on the farm at Ziggy\u2019s Refuge.", "description": "During natural disasters, who rescues the animals society has forgotten?", "authors": ["Emily Buder"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/video/img/2019/10/Hurricane_Heroes/video-featured.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
