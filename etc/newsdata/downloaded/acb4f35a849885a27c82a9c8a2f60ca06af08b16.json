It\u2019s part of the new Instagram \u201cCreate\u201d mode that launches today in Stories, bringing the app beyond the camera. Create makes Instagram a more omni-purpose social network with the flexibility to adapt to a broader range of content formats.\n\nFor now, the highlight of Create is the \u201cOn This Day\u201d option that shows a random feed post you shared on the same calendar date in the past. Tap the dice button to view a different On This Day post, and once you find one you prefer, you can share it to Stories as an embedded post people can open.\n\nThe launch could make it easy for users to convert their old impermanent content into fresh ephemeral content. That could be especially helpful because not everyone does something Stories-worthy every day. And given how many #TBT throwbacks get shared already, there\u2019s clearly demand for sharing nostalgia with new commentary.\n\nWhen asked about Create mode, an Instagram spokesperson told me, \u201cthis new mode helps you combine interactive stickers, drawings and text without needing a photo or video to share . . . On This Day suggests memories and lets you share them via Direct and Stories.\u201d It\u2019d sure be nice if embedded On This Day video posts played inside of Stories, but for now you have to tap to open them on their own page.\n\nInstagram actually launched a different way to share throwbacks, called \u201cMemories,\u201d early this year. But most users didn\u2019t know about it because it was tucked in the Profile -> Three-Line \u2018Hamburger\u2019 Sidebar -> Archive option used to for Highlighting or Restoring expired Stories or post you\u2019d hidden.\n\nNow On This Day is much more accessible as part of the new Create Mode inside the Stories composer, which replaces Type mode with more options for sharing without your camera than just posting text. You can access it by swiping right at the bottom of the screen from the Stories camera, instead of left to other options like Boomerang. Create lets you use features otherwise added as Stickers atop photos and videos, but on their own with new suggestions of what to share:\n\n-Countdown timer with suggestions for \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d \u201cQuittin\u2019 Time,\u201d and \u201cSchool\u2019s Out\u201d\n\n-Quiz with suggestions including \u201cWhat\u2019s my biggest fear?\u201d and \u201cOnly one of these is true\u201d (The Quiz sticker already had suggestions)\n\n-Poll with suggestions including \u201cSweet or savory?\u201d and \u201cBetter first date: dinner or movie?\u201d\n\n-Question with suggestions including \u201cIf you had 3 wishes\u2026\u201d and \u201cAny hidden talents?\u201d\n\nInstagram is also offering a new version of its Giphy -powered GIFs feature inside Create. It lets you search for a GIF and see it tiled three times vertically as the background of your Create post, rather than laid on top.\n\nThrough all these features, Create lets people generate new things to share even if they\u2019re laying in bed or stuck somewhere. As Instagram grows internationally to more users with lower-quality phones, and replaces Facebook for many people, the ability to share text and other stuff without having to use their camera could increase people\u2019s posting. Between the Camera shutter modes and room for more sharing styles in Create, Instagram can encompass most any content.\n\nAs of today, Instagram is about more than photos and videos. It\u2019s stepping up as a multi-faceted social app just as Facebook\u2019s battered brand becomes desperate to turn Instagram into its reputation and business lifeboat.", "description": "Instagram has finally turned Throwback Thursday into an official feature.
