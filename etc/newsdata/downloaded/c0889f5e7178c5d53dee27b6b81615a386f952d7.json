It was our first time in the country. As architects based in Beijing, we were well acquainted with the world\u2019s cities and skyscrapers, but North Korea was a dark spot in our mental map \u2014 filled in, as it was for most people, by preconceptions and stereotypes that rendered the so-called Hermit Kingdom in black and white. We had tried to leave those ideas behind, but we didn\u2019t expect that this first visit would leave us with such a sense of confusion, one where the difference between what was real and genuine was muddled by what was ostensibly staged or faked.\n\nAs soon as we left, we knew we had to return. Over the next four years we made three more visits, facilitated by a Beijing-based travel company called Koryo Tours.
