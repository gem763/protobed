Mexican lawmakers have already done so.\n\nA statement from Trudeau\u2019s office said: \u201cThe Prime Minister and the Speaker discussed progress on the new North American Free Trade Agreement and welcomed ongoing work towards its ratification.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is pressing lawmakers to quickly ratify the USMCA, which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, but Democrats who have the House majority say they will proceed only when their concerns have been addressed. The U.S. Senate is controlled by Republicans.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal told fellow House Democrats on a conference call on Tuesday that detailed proposals have been sent to the USTR and the ball was now in the USTR\u2019s court, according to a Democratic aide on the call.\n\nNeal also said he expects the pace of negotiations to increase this month, the aide said.\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Thomas Donohue told CNBC earlier on Tuesday that Congress has enough votes to pass the agreement.\n\nDonohue said passage of the USMCA would help boost the U.S. economy and reassure financial markets, which have been roiled by tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by China and the United States.\n\n\u201cIf we came up with a good strong vote on that (USMCA), it would give us a great step forward,\u201d Donohue said, adding his belief that Congress had \u201cenough votes to do it right now.\u201d", "description": "U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday that Democrats are especially concerned about enforcement of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement and Mexico's implementation of labor standards, a spokesman for Pelosi said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1425993570&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830AC"}
