It was quite dark but had little blonde tips, so it looked like she\u2019d been to the hairdresser and had the foil treatment.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n\u201cThe midwives commented on it and everyone who came to visit mentioned it. If I had a pound for every time someone commented, I would be a very rich lady.\n\n\u201cI really wanted a hairy baby. I\u2019d been born with a lot of hair and it\u2019s just how I envisaged my child would be. She looked exactly like I thought she would.\"\n\nHaving been single for three years, longing to be a mum, Kim decided to \"go it alone\" and underwent IVF with a sperm donor.\n\nFollowing three attempts - two using intrauterine insemination, or artificial insemination, and one round of IVF- costing a total of \u00a316,000, after 18 months of trying, Kimbo fell pregnant with Scarlett.\n\nShe said: \"I did choose a donor who had the same colour hair as me, but that's as much as I know about him. I don't know if he was a hairy baby, too.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old wives\u2019 tale that you get heartburn during pregnancy if you have a hairy baby, but that didn\u2019t happen with me at all.\u201d\n\nBecause Scarlett has a full head of hair, Kimbo washes it every other day with baby shampoo, planning her night-time routine to fit around it.\n\n\u201cIf I feed her too soon after she\u2019s had her bath, then her hair goes crazy because it dries in that position,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI have to wait for it to dry before I feed her.\n\n\u201cMy mum said I lost some of my hair as I grew, but that didn't happen with Scarlett, it's just kept growing. Now it\u2019s in a kind of pixie style and some days it looks like a bit of a mullet.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n\u201cIt all grows forwards into her fringe. I\u2019ve had to cut it several times already, which is ridiculous. From around four months I\u2019ve been cutting it every couple of weeks, waiting until she\u2019s asleep before getting to work.\n\n\u201cThe first time I did it when she was awake, but it was at a very funny angle. It was a proper, \u2018Mummy\u2019s cut your hair\u2019 kind of style, so I thought it was best to do it when she\u2019s sleeping and doesn\u2019t move around.\n\n\u201cI like putting it in bunches now, so she looks a lot like Boo from the Disney film Monsters, Inc.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m desperate to put it into French plaits. I\u2019m going away to Kent coast with my sister during the October half term and we\u2019re determined that between us we\u2019ll be able to do it.\"\n\nScarlett draws admiring comments from people when she is out with her mum, together with plenty of astonished remarks about the sheer amount of hair she has.\n\nKimbo laughed: \u201cI got some of the little bows for babies her age to put in it, but her hair was actually too thick to fit in them.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n\"When we go out people will comment on how much hair she has, together with quite a few blokes saying, \u2018She\u2019s got more hair than I have.\u2019\"\n\nOther parents looking at Scarlett's newborn pictures online would say their babies did not have hair like that until they were three months old.\n\n\u201cHer hair is also quite chameleon-like, in that it seems to change with whatever she\u2019s wearing,\" Kimbo continued. \"Sometimes it can look quite dark, other times it looks red or light brown.\n\n(Image: PA REAL LIFE/COLLECT)\n\n\u201cA few friends have joked, saying it would cost a lot of money to get her look done in a salon. But strangers have actually asked me if I've already taken her to a hairdresser to have it done professionally!\"\n\nRather than being shy, Scarlett laps up the attention attracted by her impressive barnet.\n\n\u201cShe has a smile for anyone who speaks to her and looks quite puzzled if she gets ignored,\u201d Kimbo said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a very nosy little whatsit, she likes to know what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a twinkle in her eye that tells me she\u2019s going to be trouble when she\u2019s older.\n\n\u201cAs for her hair - I think it will just keep growing and I\u2019m looking forward to trying out all kinds of hairstyles on her as it gets longer. \u201d\n\n", "description": "The first thing that Kimberley Godsall noticed when her gorgeous baby girl Scarlett was born was her incredible hair, and her long locks meant midwives struggled to attach the monitors", "authors": ["Hannah Whitehead", "Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Pa Real Life Collect"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20558785.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Kimbo-Godsall-hairy-baby.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
