The move promises to take smart lighting, which until now has largely confined to expensive high-end products, into the mainstream, but could make our homes more easy to hack than ever before. Cyber security experts have warned that 'there's a possibility of doing something' to these smart bulbs. The IKEA smart home products will be sold online and in stores in the US and UK starting in April.\n\nThe button would last two years running on a coin battery.\n\nThe shortcut button seems like it will allow users to coordinate the setting on several different devices at once, and bundle those settings together into 'scenes' that could then be turned on or off.\n\nOne example, pointed out by The Verge's Thomas Ricker, could be 'TV time,' which triggers the blinds to lower, a speaker to turn on, the lights to dim, and the air condition to turn on.\n\nA simpler scenario was hinted at earlier this year, when IKEA released a video of a morning routine in which the lights come on as an alarm clock goes off, the smart blinds begin to lift, and the coffee maker turned on.\n\nIKEA originally began working on its Home smart initiative in 2012.\n\nIkea's smart lamps and light bulbs allow users to control how bright or dim they want their room\n\nThe company has so far released a number of different devices in the Home smart range, including several different kinds of smart light bulbs and smart lamps, a wireless control outlet that can be used to remotely turn on devices that are plugged into it.\n\nIkea has also released a wireless speaker system, called Symfonisk, with speakers that range from $99 to $179.", "description": "A new FCC filing has revealed a new IKEA device called 'shortcut button' that would allow users to customize the company's smart home furniture into 'scenes' with the press of a button.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/19/20343808-0-image-a-39_1572378394505.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
