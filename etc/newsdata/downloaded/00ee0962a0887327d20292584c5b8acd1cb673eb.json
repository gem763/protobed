It\u2019ll be 100 per cent safe and 100 per cent illegal. So I\u2019m likely to get arrested and I could be going to prison.\u201d\n\nHe said he was doing it for the future of the world\u2019s children.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m also doing it because I\u2019m a farmer. And as a farmer I\u2019ve experienced the stress and horror of losing all my crops because of climate extremities.\u201d\n\nBut some social media users criticised the group\u2019s actions, one tweeting: \u201cI hope they all get locked up for the maximum sentence... flagrantly bragging they are going to break the law. People could die but you just don\u2019t care - hypocrisy at it\u2019s best.\u201d", "description": "Five climate campaigners have been arrested on suspicion of planning to fly drones near Heathrow Airport.
