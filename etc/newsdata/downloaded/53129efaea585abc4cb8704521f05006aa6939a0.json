A player with a compelling game, No. 2 seed Ashleigh Barty, departed Sunday. The player who beat Williams in the 2016 U.S. Open semifinals, No. 3 Karolina Pliskova, did likewise.\n\nThere remains No. 1 Naomi Osaka, the defending champion who romped through Williams here last year in a noisy final, but the rest of the field lacks for slews of Grand Slam moments. Osaka is the only other member of the final dozen to have won a Grand Slam \u2014 two, in fact \u2014 and other than that, none have reached a final. Only two have reached semifinals: No. 5 Elina Svitolina (who beat Madison Keys, 7-5, 6-4, on Sunday night) defeated Williams in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics and reached the Wimbledon semifinals in July; and No. 16 Johanna Konta, who Sunday chased away Pliskova, 6-7 (7-1), 6-3, 7-5, and has accessed three semifinals.\n\n[Djokovic retires with injury down two sets to Wawrinka]\n\nThere are two other Americans having breakthroughs, 116th-ranked Taylor Townsend and 141st-ranked Kristie Ahn. There\u2019s a hip pick to win the whole thing, Canadian Bianca Andreescu, with her seven wins over top-10 players this year, her significant title at Indian Wells and her bolt from No. 178 at the beginning of the year to No. 15 today. Townsend and Andreescu share Williams\u2019s half of the draw.\n\nBut in further evidence of the flow of the women\u2019s game, the 11 remaining have seen surprisingly little of No. 8 Williams across the net, even given her voluminous experience at 37.\n\n\n\nWilliams rolled her right ankle during the second set of Sunday\u2019s victory but finished the match. She said she would evaluate the injury again Monday; her quarterfinal match is Tuesday. (Sarah Stier/AP)\n\n\u201cIf you try to beat history and what Serena has achieved before on Arthur Ashe, she has no chance,\u201d a French coach named Thomas Drouet said of his competitor. \u201cThe only solution is to beat the girl of now,\u201d to try to offset \u201cthe Serena Williams of 2019.\u201d\n\nDrouet will burrow into pain\u00adstaking video study with that task from here to Tuesday. He coaches Qiang Wang, a 27-year-old from the metropolis of Tianjin in the northern part of China, not so far from Beijing. Some heady results in the past year, especially in Asia, have brought Wang to No. 18 in the world, and her 6-2, 6-4 win over Barty on Sunday brought her to Tuesday and to Ashe Stadium for sure and to Williams \u2014 the latter two for the first time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the soft-spoken Wang said. \u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d\n\n[Naomi Osaka ousts Coco Gauff at U.S. Open with a win that showcased more than just her skill]\n\nIn the impressive rise of \u00adChinese players behind the breakthrough feats of Li Na, the 2011 French Open and 2014 Australian Open winner, Wang is the highest-ranked of the four countrywomen in the top 50. She has played 20 Grand Slams and found her way to five third rounds, all in the past year and change.\n\nShe worked for almost five years with Peter McNamara, a former Wimbledon and Australian Open doubles champion, until January. McNamara died in July from cancer at 64.\n\n\u201cHe helped me a lot,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough to hear he\u2019s passed. I think he\u2019s always been there with me, yes. . . . He told me how to play the match. He took me to the professional tennis. So, yes, that\u2019s how he did teach me.\u201d\n\nSaid Drouet: \u201cI remember when she started with Peter \u2014 God bless him \u2014 I was always impressed with the work that she had, discipline that she had, the way she respected the sport.\u201d He called Wang \u201cthe kind of player who has this capacity of analyzing what\u2019s happening\u201d during a match. He likened her to Rafael Nadal in the sense of a capacity to avoid rushing so as to tire the opponent slowly.\n\n\u201cYeah, Q was very good, very solid,\u201d Barty said.\n\n[Novak Djokovic isn\u2019t Federer or Nadal. Don\u2019t heckle him. He\u2019s still one of the greats.]\n\nWilliams played well in a fourth-round match of high quality with No. 22 Petra Martic of Croatia. It\u2019s just that during Williams\u2019s 6-3, 6-4 win, she rolled her right ankle while hitting a volley in the fifth game of the second set. That seemed ominous in a year in which she has suffered a left ankle injury that contributed to her quarterfinal loss to Pliskova in Australia, a virus that forced her to withdraw in Miami, a knee that forced her to withdraw in Rome and a back that forced her to withdraw mid-match in Toronto.\n\n\u201cI probably should have seen a trainer in Australia,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut I just thought [Sunday], I definitely thought about that, because . . . the first thing was, like, \u2018I\u2019m finally healthy.\u2019 The last thing I want is to have another bad ankle sprain. So I just wanted to get some compression on it [from a trainer, whom she called] and tape it even stronger, and that way I can at least try to finish the match.\u201d\n\n[Taylor Townsend is part of serve-and-volley game\u2019s revival at U.S. Open]\n\nShe said she would assess it again Monday. Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said: \u201cI was very happy with today\u2019s match and also with the previous one, actually. I have no concerns at all.\u201d He said Williams is \u201cmoving better now than she was a few months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like in this tournament, I guess, I have definitely turned a different zone,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I can articulate what zone that is.\u201d\n\nShe is 36-3 in service games this tournament. Martic said: \u201cThe variety of her serve is very amazing, I think. Sometimes she goes for those precise serves. They\u2019re like two centimeters from the line, and sometimes she hits 200 kilometers an hour.\u201d\n\nOff she goes aiming for Saturday amid ample cheering from the New York crowds, whom she thanked profusely. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you guys know how much it means to me,\u201d she said Sunday as they all hoped for something \u00admomentous coming Saturday.", "description": "A rolled ankle couldn\u2019t keep Williams from a straight-sets victory over Croatia\u2019s Petra Martic in the fourth round.
