There have been campaigns for more to be added\n\nO'Sullivan also admitted in his letter that 71 per cent of stops made in the lay-bys in the previous two years were not emergency-related, raising fears that drivers with genuine vehicle issues might be unable to stop as these short pull-off areas are full.\n\nThe 3 types of smart motorway 1. Controlled Motorway Multiple lanes, variable speed limits and a hard shoulder for emergencies only. 2. Dynamic Hard Shoulder Variable speed limits and a hard shoulder that can be turned into a fourth lane when needed. Drivers are told via electric overhead signs to use the hard shoulder during peak hours. 3. All-Lanes Running Variable speed limits and a permanent fourth lane instead of a hard shoulder. Emergency refuge areas currently can be found every 2.5km (1.55 miles) though will be shortened from April 2020.\n\nIntervals between the lay-bys are due to be reduced to a maximum of one mile under new rules put in place by Highways England earlier this year, though will only apply to converted motorways from April next year.\n\nWhile these refuge lay-bys will appear more often, the AA poll found that drivers want them to occur more frequently.\n\nAlmost two thirds of the panel said they should appear every half a mile, according to the survey findings.\n\nSerious safety concerns have been mounting over ALR routes following a string of five deaths along the same stretch of the M1.\n\nEarlier this month a coroner warned that smart motorways were 'putting lives at risk' after an eight-year-old boy was killed when a lorry hit his grandfather's stranded car on the M6 last year.\n\nDev Naran, from Leicestershire, died instantly when the Toyota Yaris he was in - which was stopped in lane one, previously a hard shoulder but now a live lane - was hit at 56mph in May 2018.\n\nThe news comes as the new Secretary of State for Transport, Grant Shapps, will give evidence before the Transport Select Committee today to outline his priorities for the role.\n\nA spate of deaths on smart motorways have heightened concerns for their safety. The AA says there needs to be an urgent review of the scheme\n\nEdmund King added: 'We believe the Secretary of State should now announce a review into the safety of All Lane Running Schemes.\n\n'Unfortunately we have already seen fatalities where vehicles have been left in vulnerable positions in live lanes.\n\n'Previous research has shown that if Stopped Vehicle Detection is not in place it takes an average of 17 minutes to spot a stationary vehicle in a live lane.\n\n'Our new study shows that public trust on removing the hard shoulder has pretty much evaporated.'", "description": "Edmund King, president at the AA, warned ministers: 'Before any further smart motorway schemes begin, we need an urgent and independent review into the safety of existing schemes.'", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
