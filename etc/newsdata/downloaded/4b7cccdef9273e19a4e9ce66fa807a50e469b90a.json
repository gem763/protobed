It gave no further details.\n\nZelenskiy, a former comedian with no prior political experience, won the presidential election in April by a landslide on promises to fight corruption and transform Ukrainian politics.\n\nKolomoisky has been embroiled in a long running legal battle over control of PrivatBank, Ukraine\u2019s largest lender, which he used to own before it was nationalized in late 2016.\n\nZelenskiy has repeatedly denied suggestions that he would help Kolomoisky win back control of PrivatBank or receive compensation.\n\nThe saga is closely watched by investors because the International Monetary Fund could freeze aid to Ukraine if the PrivatBank nationalization were reversed", "description": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy met business tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky on Tuesday, the president's office said, the first reported meeting since Zelenskiy's inauguration in May between the two men who had long-standing business ties.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428432772&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891ZW", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
