Lamar Alexander of Tennessee agrees, saying jurors shouldn\u2019t be \u201crunning around announcing their decision until they\u2019ve heard the arguments.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we will be if the House impeaches the president, we\u2019ll be jurors. And we should act like jurors,\u201d he says.\n\nThe reserved nature of Republicans like Alexander, who is retiring, and the moderate Collins suggests some in the president's own party are legitimately open to Democrats' arguments \u2014 an ominous sign for Trump as he faces a possible impeachment trial in the Senate. It also has the added side benefit of excusing senators from the noisy, day-to-day chaos of the president\u2019s investigation by Congress.\n\nMany Senate Democrats are almost certain to back their House counterparts if Trump is impeached but are wary of appearing eager to oust the president. So some, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, say they aren\u2019t rushing to make any predictions about how the impeachment inquiry might end.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re jurors,\u201d said Schumer said in a brief interview. \u201cWe can push as hard as we can to get all the facts out but \u2026 we should wait until we see all the facts to make a determination.\u201d\n\nBy citing their role as jurors, senators can appear above the rancorous House proceedings \u2014 and demonstrate that they are taking their constitutional responsibilities seriously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re jurors. We can push as hard as we can to get all the facts out but \u2026 we should wait until we see all the facts to make a determination.\u201d - Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very disappointed in some who have chosen to talk about this from a political perspective,\u201d said Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), a moderate Democrat. \u201cThere are senators on both sides of the aisle who have said things that are highly partisan. And have talked about this as a political endeavor rather than ... to approach it as our job which is a potential jurist.\"\n\nBut partisanship on impeachment appears inevitable, with Republicans questioning the legitimacy of the impeachment inquiry and some Democrats, like 2020 candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) already saying that Trump should be impeached. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a recent campaign ad that impeachment stops with him as long as he remains the GOP leader.\n\nAnd some senators don\u2019t agree that their role as jurors prevents them from discussing the latest developments unfolding in the Ukraine scandal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false and spurious argument,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a former federal prosecutor. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a jury trial in the classic criminal sense. It is a political proceeding and we shirk our duty to the nation if we fail to talk.\u201d\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) has emphasized that he will be an independent juror. But that\u2019s not going to stop him from defending Trump \u201cas long as he deserves defending.\"\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should shirk our responsibilities as senators ... just because one day we might be a juror, \u201d Cramer said. \u201cFor some people it\u2019s fairly convenient to say that, I understand that, their situation is different. But I\u2019ve never been very good at shrinking.\"\n\nWhile many senators have refrained from commenting on the evidence presented before House investigators, that hasn\u2019t stopped Senate Republicans from attacking the House\u2019s impeachment proceedings.\n\nFollowing explosive testimony from top Ukraine diplomat Bill Taylor, many Republicans argued Wednesday they couldn\u2019t fairly evaluate Taylor\u2019s opening statement without having access to his full deposition.\n\n\"I'm not going to give any legitimacy to these proceedings,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nBut some say they can maintain their criticism of the House impeachment process without revealing where they\u2019d come down in a final verdict.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still fair game to be concerned about the process,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) \"But I think not trying to reach a conclusion before the House does, or before you have all the information that the House would be likely to present, is the right place for senators to be.\u201d\n\nMany senators also see no up-side to commenting this early on the impeachment proceedings. With the House impeachment inquiry moving full steam ahead, more damning information about the president could be revealed in the coming weeks. And there\u2019s no benefit to jumping to a conclusion, especially given that the Senate may not take up impeachment proceedings until early next year.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he plans to wait on an impeachment decision until he is presented with all of the relevant evidence at the Senate\u2019s trial.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to take testimony until it\u2019s all out there,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cPut it all together and view it in the full context of it.\u201d\n\nEven though a trial could still be months away, some are already tired of getting asked on a daily basis about the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do a thing until we see the facts, if it comes to us,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). \u201cIt wears me out when I hear them talking about all that [day-to-day impeachment reporting]. I usually turn stations.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Minority Leader Chuck Schumer"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/34/87/cbbf9cda445789e0275928cd91e2/20191023-susan-collins-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
