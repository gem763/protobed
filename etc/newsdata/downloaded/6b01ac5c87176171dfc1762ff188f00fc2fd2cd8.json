In 2017, more than 70,000 people died of opioid overdoses \u2015 with almost 68% of these deaths involving an illicit or prescription opioid such as OxyContin, an addictive painkiller. The deaths led the Centers of Disease Control to declare a public health emergency.\n\nEinhorn added that if a parent experiencing addiction \u201ccan take one thing away when they watch it with their kids... then that serves the purpose.\u201d\n\nNoam Galai via Getty Images Julia of \"Sesame Street\" at the 2018 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nAlthough the Sesame Street in Communities program has been praised for helping young children, their parents and caregivers, its materials have been criticized.\n\nIn August, the respected advocacy group Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), which is run by autistic individuals, announced it was cutting ties with \u201cSesame Street\u201d after the show\u2019s communities program aired public service announcements featuring Julia, the first Muppet with autism.\n\nThe PSAs encourage parents to check out the \u201cScreen for Autism\u201d initiative by the nonprofit Autism Speaks, which includes a resource called the 100 Day Kit for parents of newly diagnosed autistic children. According to ASAN, the kit encourages parents to blame family stress on their autistic child, spend time with their non-autistic children remembering how things were better before their sibling\u2019s diagnosis and to go through the five stages of grief after learning that a child is autistic, \u201cas they would if the child had died.\u201d\n\nThe disability community has been critical of Autism Speaks for a long time due to its harmful rhetoric.", "description": "The character debuted in May, but the show just announced it would explore her backstory and how kids can deal with parental addiction.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f817c200000da064ff5b5.jpeg?cache=ics9mfj64o&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
