I felt myself going down and down.'\n\nThe model, who had finally begun to accept and love her body while relishing in the rigorous training for the dancing competition, revealed her grandfather's death to the world on Instagram by sharing a black and white snap.\n\nShe wrote: 'Today I lost the most important man in my life... My gramps. He was such a treasure, my greatest teacher. I miss you so much already grampy - thank you for being everything.'\n\nDaisy, whose grandfather was a monumental figure in her life according to her mother Pearl Lowe, stopped working and exercising after being kicked off Strictly and saw herself 'put on a lot of weight' as she tried to grapple with her grief.\n\nShe also cut her long dark hair short and dyed it bleach blonde as she tried to rediscover her 'purpose'.\n\nNow, more than three years on from the devastating loss, Daisy thanked fashion designer Pearl and her mother's partner Danny Goffey for helping her through the difficult time.\n\nDaisy said she began struggle with her confidence and sense of self when she was voted out of the show soon after losing her grandfather (right)\n\nThe model described how the iconic dance show allowed her to accept her body and all that it could do\n\nShe added: 'I couldn't have got through it without my mum. Just knowing how much she loved me. How much Danny loved me and being around the family, all of that helped.'\n\nIn January 2018, Daisy - whose previous boyfriends have included actor Matt Smith and musician Mark Ronson - set about trying to heal by allowing herself to grieve.\n\nShe told how she turned down all the jobs that came her way in order to regain a sense of control in her life.\n\nAs she exerted more control in her life, moments of happiness and joy began to creep back into Daisy's life and she took up dancing again.\n\nFollowing Eddie's death, Daisy stopped working and exercising and also decided to cut her hair short and dye it blonde\n\nDaisy, who decided to leave her plans to study law in order to become a full-time model at the tender age of 17, has modelled for a number of iconic designers including Karl Lagerfeld, Burberry and Chanel.\n\nShe has also featured in shoots for a number of publications including Vogue Italia, Tatler, Elle, Grazia, InStyle and GQ.\n\nOn Monday, the model joined climate change protesters Extinction Rebellion for their first day of demonstrations in London.\n\nHowever she was faced with criticism after pictures emerged of her flying on private jets and promoting non-environmentally friendly products.\n\nLooking back at the difficult period in her life, the model said she could not have got through her grief without her mother Pearl Lowe (right)\n\nTaking to Instagram to respond to claims of 'hypocrisy', Daisy wrote: 'Yesterday I was door stopped by a journalist asking me what if felt like to be a \"hypocrite\" for campaigning with Extinction Rebellion when I've had the nerve to fly on private jets, drive \"gas guzzling\" cars and burn scented candles.\n\n'I want to respond to this once and for all because it's missing the point. Of course we can all take positive steps to help the environment such as cutting down on meat, avoiding using the car where possible and \"staycationing\" more, but I'm afraid the effects of our consumer choices are pretty minimal compared to the impact that giant fossil fuel companies have on climate change.\n\n'And this is where we need to focus our anger! A recent report states that '\"just 20 fossil fuel companies, some owned by states, some by shareholders, have produced 35 per cent of the carbon dioxide and methane released by human activities since 1965\".\n\nDaisy, who decided to leave her plans to study law in order to become a full-time model at the tender age of 17, joined climate change protesters Extinction Rebellion in London on Monday\n\n'And the only way to convince these firms and governments to change direction is by non-violent, mass political disruption, which is why I fully support the efforts of Extinction Rebellion.\n\n'Am I a hypocrite? Yes, probably, but does that mean I should just sit back and watch as the planet slowly boils to death?'\n\nIn addition to her passion for the environment, Daisy also hosts her own podcast - Femme: It's All About Being A Woman - which aims to look at the highs of lows of being a woman in today's society.", "description": "Model Daisy Lowe, 35, from London, has spoken about the demons she battled after her grandfather Eddie Davis, died aged 82 from a heart attack on the day of her Strictly rehearsals in 2016.", "authors": ["Bhvishya Patel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19656454-0-image-a-45_1570979265692.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
