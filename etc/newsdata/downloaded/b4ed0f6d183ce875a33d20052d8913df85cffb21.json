In response, Deane rehashed the advice of an avid philanderer, Nazi sympathiser and former Conservative minister to suggest that women should be more restrained in their complaints about harassment.\n\n\u201cThe late Alan Clark said: \u2018How do I know my advances are unwanted until I\u2019ve made them?\u2019\u201d argued Deane, who used to be an adviser to former PM David Cameron.\n\nDeane\u2019s words \u2013 delivered with a chilling seriousness \u2013 shocked many, but he was undeterred. It was only when Deane\u2019s profoundly misogynistic quote was widely condemned that he claimed: \u201cit doesn\u2019t reflect my views, as anyone who knows me will know.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised by any of this, however. As a victim of Deane\u2019s approach, I have no doubt that his views and actions are utterly representative of the exceedingly nasty party to which he belongs.\n\nMy recent appearance with Deane on the BBC\u2019s Dateline London triggered a hate campaign that was so ferocious the Metropolitan Police became involved. Misogyny and racism against me appeared in more than 100 pages of online harassment printed out and handed to officers.\n\nInfuriated by my contribution to the programme, social media trolls who claimed allegiance to the all-new Conservative Party had inundated me with online insults focusing on my ethnic origin, gender, religion, nationality and skin colour.\n\nThey said I had \u201cblacked up for a pantomime\u201d, that I was \u201cfilthy\u201d and that I should \u201cf*** off back\u201d to where I had come from. \u201cShe\u2019s not even British,\u201d said one of my tormentors, clearly unaware that Dateline \u2013 a flagship discussion programme that has been running in an unchanged format for almost a quarter of a century \u2013 is literally designed for correspondents who are foreign.\n\nAs a French-Algerian journalist who studied at the London School of Economics and who has worked for British institutions from the traditional Fleet Street newspapers to Oxford University, I was an obvious choice of panellist.\n\nDeane is not a journalist, but a prominent Conservative Brexiteer \u2013 one who personifies how a party that once professed to be a One Nation organisation has now changed out of all recognition. It has been purged of moderates, and is more aligned with the sinister rallying cries of far-right nationalism.\n\nIt seemed that Deane had few qualms about joining in the baiting. He posted images on Twitter of British soldiers massacring black Africans. They were from the film Zulu \u2013 which dramatised the 1879 Battle of Rorke\u2019s Drift, when red-coated infantrymen put the natives in their place, shooting dead 351 tribesmen and wounding around 500 more, for the loss of 17 Empire troops.\n\nDeane revelled in a comparison between this Imperial adventure and his efforts at subduing foes on Dateline, captioning the Zulu gif with the words: \u201cSometimes one\u2019s morning in the media is like\u201d. Needless to say, I was the only woman of African origin on Dateline \u2013 all the other guests were white and male.\n\nDeane didn\u2019t shy away from gun violence analogies that followed among his social media allies. \u201cOh for a decent machine gun!\u201d, \u201cBoth barrels fired!\u201d and \u201cThank goodness we have you there to return fire\u201d, were among the tweets Deane liked or retweeted that were seemingly directed at me.\n\nHe also liked and retweeted jubilatory posts about how he allegedly \u201cclinically destroyed\u201d, \u201cslayed\u201d, \u201cexterminated\u201d, \u201cskewered\u201d me, and \u201cshot [me] down\u201d during the debate. Deane even approved of a tweet questioning my very presence on the programme: \u201cWhy is she involved in this discussion?\u201d\n\nDeane liked tweets describing me as a \u201cmoron\u201d, \u201chalfwit\u201d, and \u201cdisgusting woman\u2026 drained out of a swamp\u201d. In short, an unwanted \u201cforeigner\u201d who needed to be \u201ceducated\u201d, as his Twitter supporters put it. Deane sneered at me throughout the programme, intimating that I was unqualified to comment on his country\u2019s political system. Deane also endorsed a tweet likening me to the \u201cbigot Alibi Nazi\u201d \u2013 a reference to Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, another journalist who, like myself and Ayesha Hazarika, is a Muslim.\n\nDespite my non-affiliated approach to politics, the online mob followed Deane\u2019s lead in falsely caricaturing me as left-wing. This was particularly alarming, according to the investigators who looked at the threats, because it evoked the murder of Jo Cox \u2013 the Labour MP who was gunned down and knifed repeatedly by an online obsessive three years ago because he considered her a \u201ctraitor\u201d to white people.\n\nWords \u2013 and especially vindictive online postings \u2013 have consequences, but the new breed of Conservative extremists remain unconcerned. Their focus is currently on crushing ideological enemies using methods honed by far-right strategists such as Steve Bannon.\n\nOnline hate can easily be intensified by the kind of anonymous accounts that assisted Deane in his attacks on me. Their interactions with him accused me of numerous monstrosities, such as support for terrorism \u2013 appalling allegations which Deane condoned by liking a series of them on Twitter.\n\nThese accounts, most likely \u201cbots\u201d, swell support for cruel messages like Deane\u2019s and push ideas into people\u2019s social feeds. It is this messaging that can warp elections when deployed at scale.\n\nThere are Tories who powerfully object to the kind of language that Deane felt able to endorse. Johnson has been told by numerous critics, not least Amber Rudd, his own former work and pensions secretary, that his own language \u201cdoes incite violence\u201d, but he could, apparently, not care less.\n\nTory grandees are evidently as disturbed about such developments as the rest of us. Ex-Conservative Party chairman Lord Patten said the brutal expulsion of his colleagues in favour of die-hard Brexit fanatics said everything about the coarse nature of the reconstituted Tories.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an English nationalist government which, as Ken Clarke said, is the most extreme far-right cabinet in the history of the Conservative Party. It\u2019s absolutely outrageous,\u201d Lord Patten told Sky News.\n\nBoris Johnson and Alex Deane are textbook examples of what the new Tory Party represents. Every one of us should be worried about the rapidly changing nature of British politics and must be extremely wary about this shift towards wickedness, and the immense harm it is doing to public life.", "description": "Conservative Party members are going to extreme lengths to defend their leader against allegations of sexual impropriety.\u00a0 One \u2013 a Tory activist called Alex Deane \u2013 went on Sky News last week to counter claims that prime minister Boris Johnson was an under-the-table groper.", "authors": ["Nabila Ramdani"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/10/Boris-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
