Of that total, $43.2-million worth of loans are currently in \u201crecovery,\u201d meaning just over 10 per cent of ACOA\u2019s portfolio is in default.\n\nBy comparison, the Business Development Bank of Canada manages $882.8-million in impaired loans, which represented 3.3 per cent of the Crown Corporation\u2019s total portfolio (comprised mainly of loans) as of March 31.\n\nLosses by Canadian banks are even lower. Over the past 20 years, Canada\u2019s big banks have averaged a one-per cent default rate among their business loans, notes Laurence Booth, a capital markets professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management.\n\nACOA has pursued dozens of companies for outstanding loans in recent years. According to figures obtained through an Access to Information request, ACOA is owed more than $65 million from loans it sent to recovery in just the four years between January 1, 2015 and January 2019.\n\nThe recovery process is triggered when a company defaults on its ACOA debt. The process can involve the agency suing and seeking a legal judgement against the debtor company, and requesting a set off from the Canada Revenue Agency \u2014 basically laying claim to any tax refunds owed by CRA to the debtor.\n\nThe loans ACOA sent to recovery between 2015 and early 2019 are connected to a variety of businesses, from tech startups to ventures focused on cranberries, fish farms, caviar, goat cheese, cedar homes, potatoes, furs, oilfield drilling services, berries, soap, and juice, to name a few.\n\nIn an email, the agency said it is \u201cnot unusual\u201d to have $65-million in loans sent to recovery in four years. Additionally, only six per cent of its funding agreements have been sent to recovery or written off since its creation in 1987. \u201cThe vast majority of recipients of ACOA funding meet their contracting obligations,\u201d the agency noted.\n\nDonald Savoie, a professor at the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton, who has been described as the father of ACOA, says the agency is an \u201ceasy target\u201d for criticism and, historically, some of it was justified. Questionable spending during its early \u201cfat\u201d years generated bad press that hurt the agency\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe agency was created by the government of Brian Mulroney, based on the blueprint Savoie outlined in a report commissioned by the prime minister.\n\n\u201cIt might not have been unfair 30 years ago to say Atlantic Canada was getting into some boondoggles,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you it\u2019s unfair to lay that label now at ACOA because its budget is modest compared to what it was 20 years ago, and compared to the other regions it\u2019s very well run.\u201d\n\nSavoie does have one concern, though. The current minister responsible for ACOA, Navdeep Bains, is an MP for Mississauga, Ont., making him the first federal politician from outside Atlantic Canada to oversee ACOA. \u201cWhich I find a bit much to take,\u201d Savoie said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an awful idea\u2026 Wake me up when you see the minister responsible for economic development in Ontario is from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.\u201d\n\nIn defence of its record, ACOA also pointed to successful startups it has funded, such as Ocean Nutrition Canada, which focused on products derived from fish-oil and was sold to Royal DSM, a Dutch company, in 2012 for $540 million. ACOA says it invested $6 million in Ocean Nutrition.\n\nMany other ACOA investments have tanked, however.\n\nTech Link International Entertainment Limited, a Nova Scotia company focused on responsible gaming technology, went bankrupt and ceased operations in 2015, leaving ACOA to chase nearly $3.2 million. In 2016-17, Nova Scotia Business Inc., the province\u2019s business development agency, wrote-off more than $10-million worth of equity, loans and interest associated with Tech Link.\n\nTwo levels of government were left chasing debts, but John Xidos, Tech Link\u2019s former chief executive and founder, argues there was a solid return on their investments: Tech Link existed for 20 years and employed up to 100 people.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that they gave us some money one year and we were out of business the next,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nDean Smith\u2019s Halifax-based electronic voting company, Intelivote Systems Inc., is another ACOA debtor. Smith says Intelivote is still in business, but he\u2019s seeking an exit strategy \u2014 either a new partner or even a new owner.\n\nThat process has been on and off for five years, in part because it\u2019s a tough sell: Intelivote owes a lot of money, including nearly $1.4 million to ACOA, and $2.8 million to NSBI. Without a new approach, Dean says, it\u2019s not feasible to fully repay those debts.\n\n\u201cI think they would prefer to get some of their money rather than none,\u201d he said, \u201cso that\u2019s kind of where it\u2019s heading now.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post", "description": "As of Sept. 30, ACOA managed an active loan portfolio totalling $422.9 million; of that total, $43.2-million worth of loans are in 'recovery'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/money-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
