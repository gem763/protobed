(AP) - An injured bald eagle that eluded capture for days is getting veterinary care after being cornered in a northwestern Indiana neighborhood.\n\nThe male adolescent eagle was captured Wednesday morning by a Hammond resident who corralled it with a cat carrier. The raptor was taken to an animal hospital, where veterinarians are assessing it for injuries or ailments.\n\nThe eagle was first spotted Monday hopping about in a yard near the Grand Calumet River in Hammond.\n\nSteve Lakatos is the director of the Humane Indiana Wildlife Center. He tells The (Northwest Indiana) Times the eagle is strong and alert \u201cbut you can tell from his posture he doesn\u2019t feel well.\u201d\n\nLakatos says it\u2019s suspected that the young eagle has a wing injury because it cannot fly very well.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times, http://www.nwitimes.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "An injured bald eagle that eluded capture for days is getting veterinary care after being cornered in a northwestern Indiana neighborhood.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
