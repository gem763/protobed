But it\u2019s really just a question of how can we do that in practice.\u201d\n\nOwen Smith, the former Labour leadership contender, went further, telling The Independent: \u201cIt would be the height of folly for Labour to agree to an election before Brexit is resolved\n\n\u201cIt would let Boris Johnson off the hook he has hung himself on and allow him to play the martyr in a contest that would only really focus on Brexit.\n\n\u201cAll the polling suggests Labour would lose badly in such election, so why on earth would we dance to Johnson\u2019s tune and risk letting down the people who need to a progressive government in Westminster?\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It is the almost unanimous view.\n\n\u201cI assume that is the message being passed onto the leadership and, of course, Keir Starmer and John McDonnell \u2013 someone who is close to Jeremy \u2013 think the same way.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, Jeremy has got to take that into consideration before he forces us into a vote for an election that will split the party.\u201d\n\nHowever, it is still unclear how a Final Say referendum could be delivered, even if Labour explicitly backs it.\n\nIt would require Mr Johnson to be toppled in a vote of no confidence and replaced by a so-called \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d to pass the necessary legislation.\n\nHowever, those cross-party talks collapsed over the failure to identify a caretaker prime minister \u2013 with Labour insisting it must be Mr Corbyn, while the Liberal Democrats and sacked former Tories say he is unacceptable.\n\nSpeaking in Northampton, the Labour leader told the prime minister: \u201cTake no deal off the table and then let\u2019s have the election,\u201d promising a referendum would follow if Labour won.", "description": "Labour MPs are blitzing Jeremy Corbyn with demands for a U-turn that would see him throw his weight behind a fresh Brexit referendum before a general election.
