It last happened in 2015, when each of the big four went to investors in the space of five months.\n\nEquity markets are wide open for follow-on raisings, especially from blue chip companies; Macquarie, Transurban, Mirvac, DEXUS and GPT have proved that in the past six months. There was even support for the troubled AMP.\n\nAn institutional placement, arranged overnight and run during the course of one trading day, could instantly get any one of the banks to its required Tier 1 capital ratio.
