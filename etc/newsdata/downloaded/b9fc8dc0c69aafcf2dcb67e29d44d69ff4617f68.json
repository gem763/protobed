The former bad boy of the American circuit shot a 65 in the first round of the \u00a35.6 million Italian Open to remind everyone of his undoubted quality.\n\nPadraig Harrington has been taking the 43-year-old\u2019s candidature seriously, ever since Sabbatini changed his citizenship from South Africa to Slovakia - the home country of his wife - earlier this year. Ostensibly that was to establish the former world No 8 as eligible for next year\u2019s Olympics, but the biennial dust-up is also in Whistling Straits in 11 months is also on his radar.\n\n\u201cI've got some roots here in Italy and it\u2019s good to be here,\u201d Sabbatini said after five birdies, an eagle and a solitary bogey took him to within one of the pace set by Finland\u2019s Tapio Pulkkanen. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to continue what I did today - keep the ball in play, minimise the stress, and see what happens.\u201d\n\nIt is fair to say that stress once seemed to follow Sabbatini\u2019s career around. At one PGA Tour event he stormed ahead of Ben Crane, finishing a hole before his playing partner had even reached the green following a disagreement about slow play and, in 2011, was fined for yelling at a volunteer for daring to look at his ball.", "description": "Perhaps Rory Sabbatini\u2019s bid to make Europe\u2019s team for next year\u2019s Ryder Cup is not as unlikely as it first sounded.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212618792-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvxY1SBh3Zy94n8Z2-u3DXqy1OMJSZvMkDBucnZm7PB8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
