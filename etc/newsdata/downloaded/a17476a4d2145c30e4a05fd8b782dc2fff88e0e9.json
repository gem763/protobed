Officers shot and killed one dog, and the other strangled itself on a control device, the police said.\n\nOne of the men attacked, a 72-year-old who had been standing at a bus stop, was dragged down the street during the incident in the 6600 block of Hil-Mar Drive in the District Heights area, the police said. He had serious injuries to his face and hands, the police said.\n\nThe other man, 52, tried to escape the dogs by climbing on a car, but the dogs pulled him off his perch, the police said.\n\nOfficers arrived on the scene around 11:15 a.m. as the 52-year-old was being attacked by both dogs. The officers obtained a dog pole, an animal control device, and used it to get one of the dogs off the man. A dog pole has a type of noose at its end.\n\nThe dog, which had been acting in a \u201cvery aggressive way,\u201d strangled itself on the pole, said Jennifer Donelan, the chief police spokeswoman.\n\nThe other dog went into a yard and tried to attack three officers, Donelan said.\n\nShe said on the dog\u2019s second attempt to attack, police shot and killed the dog.\n\nIt was not clear who owned the dogs, or what breed they were.\n\nDonelan said bystanders and neighbors had tried to help the 72-year-old as he was being dragged. They grabbed sticks and trash cans to use, she said, but their efforts were unavailing, according to Donelan.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "One dog was fatally shot, police say; the second also died.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GDxhrBjEUjUgrgBb2Ca1wYpQ6R8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WG6UEMHMSEI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
