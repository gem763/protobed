The front-month November contract was at $64.88 a barrel, up 48 cents, by 1113 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 59 cents to $58.72 a barrel, set to post a gain of over 7% for the week.\n\n\"Investors should probably assume that oil stabilises for now in the $60-65 per barrel range, though the risk is to the upside,\" said Christopher Wood from Jefferies.\n\n\"The central message from the attacks is the vulnerability of the Saudi infrastructure\".\n\nSaudi Arabia's production dropped by almost half after the attack on Saturday, Sept. 14, crippled a major oil processing facility. Its oil minister has pledged to restore lost production by the end of this month. reporters were shown repair work underway at Khurais, one of the two attacked sites. Cranes were erected around two burnt-out stabilisation columns, which form part of oil-gas separation units, and melted pipes. Aramco said at the site on Friday that it was shipping equipment from the United States and Europe to rebuild the damaged facilities.\n\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia blame Iran for the assault on Saudi oil facilities. Tehran denies any involvement.\n\n\"You have the flooding in Houston as well so going into the weekend, there will be a lot of short covering, which will support prices,\" Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix consultancy said.\n\n\"Next week, you have the UN General Assembly meeting so the focus will turn to whether U.S. President Trump actually meets Iran's president.\"\n\nIn the United States, meanwhile, torrential rain from Tropical Storm Imelda has forced a major refinery to cut production and to shut a key oil pipeline, terminals and a ship channel in Texas. Mobil Corp XOM.N shut some units at its 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery while Valero Energy Corp (NYSE: ) VLO.N reduced production at its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur refinery.\n\nGlobal markets are also keeping an eye on U.S.-China trade negotiations in Washington, as officials from both sides resumed face-to-face talks for the first time in nearly two months on Thursday.", "description": "UPDATE 4-Oil heading for 7% weekly gain after Saudi attacks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1F08D_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
