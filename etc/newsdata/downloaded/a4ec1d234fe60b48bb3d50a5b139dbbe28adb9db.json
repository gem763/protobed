The recommended changes from a small committee of board members include a new corporate reporting structure, creating a new safety group and building simpler cockpits, the Times said. Under one proposed change, engineers would reportedly report directly to the company's head engineer, rather than a business-unit leader who might favor production deadlines over fixing problems. Boeing reported a sharp dropoff in monthly aircraft production last week as the 737 Max remains grounded. Boeing shares are up 18% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's 20% gain.", "description": "Boeing Co.'s full board of directors is expected to hear a report this week detailing structural corporate changes that can be made to improve the safety of...", "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
