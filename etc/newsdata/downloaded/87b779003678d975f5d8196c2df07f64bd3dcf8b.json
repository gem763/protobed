The challenge for Antonio Costa in his second term will be to deliver the social gains that he promised while maintaining ambitious budget targets amid a slowing economy. Critics say Costa didn\u2019t use the good times to carry out long-needed reforms and prepare the indebted Iberian nation for the next downturn. Growth is already at half the pace it was two years ago.\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening\n\nStill Talking | U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains defiant about Britain leaving the EU on Oct. 31, but only has until the end of this week to convince Europe\u2019s leaders he has a realistic proposal in time for their next summit.

Robert Hutton answers your questions here.\n\nRetirement Blues | Pension funds across Europe are struggling to generate the returns they need to cover their growing obligations.

Here\u2019s how the continent\u2019s producers plan to react.\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nAircraft Probe | Boeing\u2019s ventures with Embraer face a deeper antitrust probe from the EU, as regulators said the transaction threatens to knock out an important rival to the world\u2019s biggest planemakers. The European Commission is worried the deal would \u201cremove Embraer as the third largest global competitor\u201d to both Boeing and Airbus, which \u201cmay therefore result in higher prices and less choice.\u201d\n\nSpanish Polls | Spain\u2019s Socialists would once more be the most voted party in an electoral rerun but would still fall short of a majority, according to an IMOP Insights poll published by El Confidencial.
