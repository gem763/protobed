The declaration, issued in February, says that the situation at the southern border is a border security and humanitarian crisis that threatens U.S. national security. Mr. Trump made the declaration so that he could unilaterally build a border wall despite the fact that Congress did not appropriate the funds for him to do so. Under the declaration, President Trump diverted funding from congressionally approved military construction projects to pay for border barriers.\n\nThe administration has so far reprogrammed about $6.1 billion in funding for the construction of border barriers.\n\nIn March, the Senate voted to reject the emergency declaration, but the president promptly vetoed the measure and instructed the Department of Defense to divert funds for a border wall. The House of Representatives failed to override the veto.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is targeting Republican incumbents who voted against terminating the emergency declaration that diverts money from defense projects in their states.\n\nThe DSCC has released two new ads against Arizona Sen. Martha McSally and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who are facing re-election in 2020. Both states stand to lose millions in expenditures due to the diversion of funds, according to estimates from the Department of Defense.\n\nAt the time of the initial vote, Congress did not know which defense projects would be affected. Earlier this month, the Department of Defense released a list of projects potentially impacted and several of the projects are in states Democrats are targeting in their effort to flip the Senate.\n\nEditorial boards in Texas and North Carolina have criticized the president's decision to take funds for defense projects in their states to build a border wall.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for their refusal to fund border security in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Washington Democrats decided that giving this very real crisis the resources it required might anger the far left which wants them to oppose President Trump at any costs,\" McConnell said.\n\nDSCC Spokesperson Stewart Boss told CBS News in a statement, \"Republican Senators paved the way for this harmful raid on critical military construction funding, and they just knowingly voted again to uphold this bogus emergency declaration and allow the Trump administration to keep diverting money away from their own states.\"\n\nThe new digital ads will run on Facebook and target McSally, Tillis, and McConnell as well as Senators John Cornyn of Texas, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Cory Gardner of Colorado.", "description": "President Trump vetoed a similar congressional resolution earlier this year", "authors": ["Eleanor Watson"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/16/628b537c-fa9b-431a-a7d6-8a348a549337/thumbnail/1200x630/e1ee4f0baf8eb3800d40aaf65130e406/ap-19197697240041.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
