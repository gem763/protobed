She was also setting up a larger argument, one which basically boils down to: Studios, treat every actress the way FX treats Michelle Williams. \u201cI see this as an acknowledgement of what is possible when a woman is trusted to discern her own needs, feels safe enough to voice them, and respected enough that they\u2019ll be heard,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I asked for my dance classes, I heard \u2018yes.\u2019 When I asked for more voice lessons, I heard \u2018yes.\u2019 A different wig, a pair of teeth not made out of rubber, \u2018yes.\u2019 All these things, they require effort and they cost more money, but my bosses never presumed to know better than I did about what I needed to do my job and to honor Gwen Verdon.\u201d Said Williams, \u201cThank you FX and to Fox 21 Studios for supporting me completely and paying me equally.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, Williams pointed to the discrepancy between how the Michelle Williams of Hollywood are treated, both on set and in their paycheck, compared to performers of color, specifically black actresses. \u201cNext time a woman, and especially a woman of color, because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white male counterpart, tells you what she needs in order to do her job, listen to her. Believe her, because one day she might stand in front of you and say \u2018thank you\u2019 for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment, not in spite of it.\u201d", "description": "Michelle Williams praises the makers of Fosse/Verdon in her 2019 Emmys speech, calling for the industry to support actresses of color.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/22/22-michelle-williams.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
