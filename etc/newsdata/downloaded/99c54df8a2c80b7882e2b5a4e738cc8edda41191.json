American agricultural producers, also reeling from bad weather and low commodity prices, are a core component of Trump\u2019s political base.\n\nUnder the deal, Japan will lower or reduce tariffs on some $7.2 billion of American-grown farming products, including beef and pork.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s priority was to win a pledge that the U.S. won\u2019t slap tariffs on Japanese automobile exports, a sector valued at about $50 billion a year and a cornerstone of the country\u2019s economy.\n\nRead more: Click here for the most recent research from Bloomberg Economics\n\nThe written text of the deal doesn\u2019t explicitly cover auto tariffs, but Abe has said he received assurances that Japan would be spared from them.\n\nThe proposed pact won\u2019t lower the barriers protecting Japan\u2019s rice farmers -- a powerful group supporting Abe\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. This could help the prime minster smooth the deal\u2019s course through parliament, where it must be ratified before coming into effect.\n\nThe U.S. has said this agreement -- which was signed in principle on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly last month -- is just the first phase of a broader agreement.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Justin Sink in Washington at jsink1@bloomberg.net;Jennifer A.
