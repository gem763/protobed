From 1989 to 2018, the top 1% of Americans increased their cumulative wealth by an astounding $21tn, while the bottom 50% of the country saw their share decrease by $900bn.\n\nIf you believe the prevailing philosophy of US conservative ideology, the handful of individuals in the 1% are entitled to every bit of their wealth and power because they deployed their capital wisely.\n\nAs businessmen in the 1%, living in a conservative state, we confront this philosophy every day, and frankly, we\u2019re sick of it.\n\nThe Republican party\u2019s embrace of the \u201cI\u2019ve-done-it-all-on-my-own\u201d mentality is extraordinarily delusional, harmful, and counterproductive. Collective goods \u2013 like a sound infrastructure system, a strong K-12 and higher education systems, and rule of law \u2013 are critical ingredients to building both individual and societal economic prosperity.\n\nUntil more of our wealthy contemporaries recognize their responsibility to strengthen these collective goods, there is little hope of addressing our growing inequality before it destroys us.\n\nThat\u2019s why we joined the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of wealthy Americans from all walks of life across deep red, deep blue and purple states, who are united under the idea that our system \u2013 the same one that created the opportunity for businessmen like us to succeed \u2013 is fundamentally broken, hijacked by the ultra-wealthy.\n\nHow to fix capitalism: nine expert solutions for America's broken system Read more\n\nMany of our peers are confounded by this assertion, in light of the benefits we have reaped. But it\u2019s precisely due to our privileged vantage point that we feel a duty to speak out about the injustices we see.\n\nNeither of us succeeded on our own. Our business benefited immensely from our country\u2019s and state\u2019s infrastructure, which we did not create. For example, we had the advantage of an affordable and outstanding public education system at the University of Utah, and of a complex and thorough system of laws and rules that we learned to successfully navigate.\n\nYes, the right combination of smart decisions, hard work and talent are essential ingredients of success, but they\u2019re of limited value if the opportunities aren\u2019t there to begin with.\n\nToday, for much of our country, there are more barriers blocking opportunity than there are pathways leading to it. The tax cuts passed by Congress in December 2017 accelerated the concentration of wealth at the very top, at the expense of our rapidly deteriorating institutions and infrastructure that once allowed Americans to climb the ladder of opportunity.\n\nAs members of the Patriotic Millionaires, we are organizing to ensure that wealthy Americans \u2013 including corporate America \u2013 pay more taxes (so that our institutions and infrastructure are available to all people living in this country) and that there is a national minimum wage (so that everyone in this country who is willing and able to work can live a reasonable life).\n\n\u201cConscious capitalism\u201d, a term that is often used cavalierly, needs to be reclaimed from the corporate marketing spin masters who merely want to rebrand while continuing to abuse the existing system. About 200 CEO members of the Business Roundtable appear to recognize that if capitalism in America is to survive, it must undergo radical, transformative change.\n\nBut a substantive and sincere commitment to an evolved form of capitalism requires a few things. It requires us to confront the reality of the climate crisis as the existential threat of our time; and to acknowledge that we are a country founded on the toxic prejudice of white supremacy, which continues to unjustly shape the future of millions of Americans before they\u2019re even born. We must separate money from politics, so that the influence of special interests doesn\u2019t overpower the voices of voters; and shift our financial goals from short-term profits to long-term sustainability.\n\nAnd it requires economically advantaged folks like us to not only pay our fair share, but also unequivocally commit to and support the policies that will achieve that reality \u2013 and to get all of our similarly situated friends and associates to do the same.\n\nNo one, not any one of us, succeeds in a vacuum. It\u2019s time we build a country and an economic system that recognizes this truth.", "description": "A group of wealthy Americans from all walks of life across red, blue and purple states are united under the idea that our system is fundamentally broken", "authors": ["Jonathan Ruga", "Scott Young"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c63fada1ab398daf2d0f15b4a829389fda6551f/0_61_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=101203b4a8d05130fd99cf958cb092b9"}
