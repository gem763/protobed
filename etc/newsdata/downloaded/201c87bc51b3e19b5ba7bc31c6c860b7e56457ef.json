REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nShopping malls closed early on Thursday to avoid becoming targets of planned protests and the city\u2019s metro, which has borne the brunt of violent unrest in recent weeks, shut three hours early.\n\nBy mid-evening protests had failed to materialize in any sizeable form, with some 60 demonstrators gathering outside one police station. In contrast to massive daytime rallies, night protests generally see a few hundred demonstrators stage scattered events, often late at night.\n\nFour months of large and often violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nThe protests started in opposition to an extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent for trial in Communist Party-controlled mainland Chinese courts, but have morphed into a broader pro-democracy movement.\n\nChina has accused some foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, of fanning anti-China sentiment over Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam introduced emergency laws last Friday, banning face masks that protesters use to shield their identities, in an effort to quell unrest. But the move sparked some of the worst violence since protests started.\n\nMany Hong Kongers fear the emergency laws could be expanded and further erode their rights.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government said on Thursday that a policy address from Lam scheduled for Oct. 16, when the Legislative Council next sits, would not include any further measures to combat the violence.\n\n\u201cWe have no further intention, particularly in the context of the policy address, of devising new measures to clamp down on protests,\u201d Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung told a news conference. Lam has not ruled out asking Beijing for help.\n\nCheung said the government\u2019s operations were not aimed at stopping protests, but violence. \u201cWe never clamp down on protests, we only clamp down on violence,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA protest if it\u2019s legal, if it\u2019s lawful, if it\u2019s peaceful...in Hong Kong, assemblies and protests are part of Hong Kong\u2019s landscape, part of our core values.\u201d\n\nANGER AT POLICE\n\nMany Hong Kongers fear Beijing is eroding their freedoms and are angry at the city\u2019s government for failing to solve social issues such as unaffordable housing and poor job prospects.\n\nUnder a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula adopted when Britain returned its former colony to China in 1997, Hong Kong has a high-degree of autonomy and its residents enjoy freedoms that do not exist on the mainland.\n\n\u201cThe violence has been accelerating a lot. I think they (police) are really damaging the law and the legal system,\u201d said protester David, a 27-year-old accountant, wearing a black mask and clutching a sign saying \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nPolice have fired live rounds and used baton charges and water cannons to quell the unrest. Two teenagers have been shot. Police fired 367 tear gas canisters over the long weekend, when tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets.\n\nApple Inc on Wednesday removed an app protesters have used to track police, prompting some to say they may \u201cvisit\u201d Apple stores in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker Charles Mok wrote to Apple\u2019s chief Tim Cook urging the company to stand up to Chinese pressure and requested the app be restored.\n\nMok said in his letter that the app \u201chelps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe Hong Kongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression,\u201d Mok said in the letter.\n\nRESENTMENT AT LIVING COSTS\n\nChina\u2019s mainland security forces are not part of Hong Kong police operations, the government said on Thursday, responding to internet rumors the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) and mainland police were involved.\n\nThe PLA has a garrison in Hong Kong but troops have remained in barracks since the protests started.\n\nOn Sunday, Chinese soldiers issued a warning to Hong Kong protesters who shone lasers at their barracks in the city, in the first direct interaction between mainland military forces and demonstrators.\n\nBesides calling for the protection of their civil liberties, many young protesters are also incensed at Hong Kong\u2019s widening inequality, sky-high property prices and poor job prospects.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe Asian financial hub is facing its first recession in a decade, but it boasts the world\u2019s most expensive property market, with prices rocketing over 200% in the past decade, driven by limited housing supply and mainland Chinese buyers.\n\nTiny living spaces are common, some of the poorest living in cage homes - wire mesh hutches stacked on top of each other.
