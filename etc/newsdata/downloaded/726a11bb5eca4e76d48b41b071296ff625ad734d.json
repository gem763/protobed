Napoli away, the same test as confronts Liverpool at the San Paolo on Tuesday. It is a reunion with a team who almost eliminated Liverpool in the group stage and who Klopp semi-affectionately called \u201cthe cheeky bastards\u201d.\n\nLiverpool lost 1-0 in Italy last October. \u201cThe manager said it was probably our worst game of the season,\u201d Trent Alexander-Arnold underlined on Saturday. Klopp elaborated on that with a frank admission that it was a failure of organisation; not so much on his part, as by the players who failed to heed his advice that Carlo Ancelotti was fielding both Allan and Marek Hamsik at the base of the midfield and then failed to adapt.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about intensity,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThe Napoli game last season was not intensity, Napoli was an organisation problem. All the things we tell the boys, it is all about intensity and how much we have to invest, but before that it is all about information. What do you have to do in these moments?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cAnd Napoli play a specific style. To make it very simple, we played against them in our defending like they had one No. 6 but they had two No. 6s, the cheeky bastards. We knew before. We told them [that] they had two No. 6s but then everyone came too late. We tried to change it in the game and nobody listened and nobody could change and in the end, we were lucky it was only 1-0. It was really this kind of day off.\u201d\n\nIf it represented a rare off-day in a season when Liverpool only lost seven games, three were away from home in their Champions League group. They took a perilous path to glory, but Klopp is adamant that Liverpool\u2019s sixth European Cup does not change their status against a team who he has admired under first Maurizio Sarri and now Ancelotti. Liverpool have not won in Italy for a decade and Klopp feels the Champions League is so strong it doubles up as a European Super League.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Champions League final Reuters 100/100 Champions League final AP\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go there as a favourite,\u201d Klopp insisted. \u201cYes, we won the competition last season but it is difficult, a very strong side, vice-champion of Italy two years in a row and really close to Juventus this year.\u201d\n\nNothing has changed. Or not for him, anyway. Klopp maintained his breezy optimism during a spell when he lost his last six finals. Two Champions League final losses, one with Borussia Dortmund and one with Liverpool, did not define him in his own mind. Nor, now, does the achievement of conquering the continent which, to another, might have felt like the culmination of a lifetime\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cI do not know the last time I thought about winning the Champions League without being asked about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must be months ago. I don\u2019t wake up and think about this. The last time I was on holiday. Nothing has changed for me. I was self-confident before. I have never had an issue with self-confidence.\u201d\n\nWhere it has made a difference, he feels, is to the self-esteem of his charges. Liverpool established a reputation as one of Europe\u2019s most formidable sides despite a seven-year wait for silverware at Anfield. Klopp\u2019s dressing room features players who have been relegated or overlooked at previous clubs, who have suffered setbacks and now have the sort of achievement that validates them.\n\nThe competition he is most interested in is within his own squad. He is buoyed by the way Xherdan Shaqiri has adapted to a new role, conscious that Naby Keita will return soon, pleased others took note of a fit-again Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s fine performance at Southampton, saying he had \u201cno explanation\u201d why Dejan Lovren did not make the matchday squad against Newcastle on Saturday. \u201cThis is a really big club with competition between friends,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is not \u2018I have to kill him to play,\u2019 it is really for the team.\u201d\n\nAnd he feels silverware can spur them on. \u201cFor the boys, they are young people and they feel they have things to prove,\u201d Klopp argued. \u201cNot to me. To the outside world, to go for the next one.\u201d And so they do, looking to become the first Liverpool side to retain the European Cup since 1978, the first English team to do so since Nottingham Forest in 1980.", "description": "If last season\u2019s Champions League provided the highlight of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s career, he has been precise in pinpointing the low point of a glorious campaign.
