Then comes the reveal.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not. (Sorry.),\u201d the ad continues. \u201cBut what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform \u2014 and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWarren\u2019s ad further claims that \"if Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump\u2019s checks. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they\u2019re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It\u2019s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable \u2014 add your name if you agree.\u201d\n\nWarren (D-Mass.) has already called for Facebook to be broken up, an idea that founder Mark Zuckerberg did not like very much. And her latest shot at the platform has continued a debate on disinformation spread by politicians and whether traditional and social media companies had an obligation \u2014 or even a right \u2014 to curtail them.\n\nHer campaign\u2019s Facebook ad appeared to refer to the controversy surrounding a Trump campaign spot titled \u201cCorruption,\" which made false assertions about former vice president Joe Biden and claimed, with no evidence, that the 2020 Democratic presidential contender offered $1 billion to Ukraine to help his son Hunter Biden. It also accused several prominent television journalists of supporting impeachment. The ad ran as the president finds himself engulfed in scandal, after a whistleblower revealed that Trump appeared to ask Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Those revelations have led House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPoliticians are treated differently than other Facebook users when it come to making false claims on the platform, The Washington Post\u2019s technology team reported Thursday. Politicians\u2019 statements are not subjected to the same fact-checking scrutiny that other advertisements typically go through, the vice president of global affairs and communications Nick Clegg said last month.\n\n\u201cWe do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules,\u201d Clegg said. A subsequent post on Facebook\u2019s website clarified that this policy covered \u201corganic content or ads.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFacebook\u2019s rationale for not curtailing this content boils down to three points: that they fear encroachment on free speech; that these statements are often newsworthy; and that politicians are already fact-checked anyway.\n\nIn a written response to the Biden campaign\u2019s complaints, Katie Harbath, the platform\u2019s public policy director for global elections, said that the company allowed such ads to stand because \u201cour approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone referred The Washington Post to Clegg\u2019s and Harbath\u2019s previous statements.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just Facebook that\u2019s taking heat. Democrats such as presidential candidate Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have called for Twitter to take action on Trump\u2019s hyperactive account, which he has used to peddle conspiracy theories and lodge racist and sexist attacks against political opponents. Twitter has long refused to do so.\n\nAD\n\nIn some ways, the networks must thread a very difficult needle: how to maintain the least toxic political discourse possible without taking actions that will anger privacy experts and free speech advocates, or trigger outrage from conservatives, who frequently allege that the social networks are biased against them.\n\nBut campaigns are spending millions of dollars to push these ads to millions of Americans, and citizens on both sides of the aisle are, understandably, nervous about a repeat of 2016. Facebook has introduced new tools to make political advertising more transparent, including an Ad Library that documents every ad the campaigns and other political entities have run and how much they\u2019re spending on the platform. But controversies such as the one that has erupted over Trump\u2019s ad suggest to critics that the platform isn\u2019t doing enough to prevent the onslaught of malicious digital campaigning in 2020. If the Trump campaign can get away with claiming that Joe Biden tried to give a billion-dollar bribe to Ukraine, then his potential opponents are left to wonder \u2014 what else are they going to try?\n\nAD\n\nWithout any clear sense of where lines are on social media, politicians of both parties will likely continue to cross them. And in response, critics of the platform \u2014 and Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 are likely to continue to loudly and persistently push for greater accountability.\n\nThe controversial Trump ad in question is no longer running on Facebook. It expired on Oct. 6. But according to the Facebook Ad Library, the Trump campaign has since moved on to ads hawking \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d T-shirts.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Warren trolled Facebook's political-ad policy with a cheeky ad of her own.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/s4EJ8MpM7_3_8z8H9dkFpqlDxXg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CARQS6XMRII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
