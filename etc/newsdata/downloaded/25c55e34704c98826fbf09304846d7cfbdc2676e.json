The codes understand modifiers as well, so a sentence that includes \"not happy\" would be correctly labeled as unfavorable.\n\nResults showed that front page stories from both outlets had the same sentiment scores, meaning there was no overall difference in the favorability of front page news between The Times and Reuters.\n\nThe Times tended to be more positive in its coverage of business and slightly more negative in international and national news articles than Reuters.\n\n'But what about Trump?' the study asks\n\nTo test potential bias in coverage of Trump, researchers gathered articles using a keyword search on both publications. If an article had \"Trump\" as a keyword, the team determined he was the main focus of the story.\n\nAgain, the typical difference between the sentiment scores was close to zero, demonstrating stories from both publications were written using similar words to convey similar sentiments, according to the study.\n\nReuters had a few more positive Trump stories than The Times, but Dalal said the difference was too small to be considered statistically significant based on sample size.\n\n\"Reuters is slightly positive, but when you're comparing thousands of articles there's going to be some randomness in there,\" he said. \"There was no resounding media biased we could find.\"\n\nDalal said he hoped the findings encourage people to think more critically about media bias and how to determine if it exists regardless of their personal politics.\n\n\"I'm apolitical, I'm not a political person, but I wanted to figure out if this rhetoric was true or not,\" he said. \"We need to use algorithms to determine these things because data isn't biased.\"", "description": "Researchers decided to look into accusations of media bias against The New York Times in its Trump coverage.
