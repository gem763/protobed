The effort was apparently unsuccessful.\n\nStranded passengers can find more information at the UK Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s website, or its 24-hour hotline: 0300 303 2800 from the UK and Ireland, and +44 1753 330 330 from overseas.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nThomas Cook, a 178-year-old British travel company and airline, declared bankruptcy early Monday morning local time in the UK, suspending operations and leaving hundreds of thousands of tourists stranded around the world.\n\nThe travel company operates its own airline, with a fleet of nearly 50 medium and long-range jets, and owned several smaller airlines and subsidiaries, including German carrier Condor. Thomas Cook still had several flights in the air as of Sunday night, but was expected to cease operations once they landed at their destinations.\n\nCondor posted a message to its site late Sunday night saying that it was still operating, but it was unclear whether that would change. Condor\u2019s scheduled Monday morning flights appeared to be operating normally.\n\nAround 600,000 Thomas Cook customers were reported to be traveling, of which were 150,000 British and were abroad, scheduled to fly home with Thomas Cook, the company told CNN.\n\nThe British Department for Transport and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) prepared plans, under the code name \u201cOperation Matterhorn,\u201d to repatriate stranded British passengers. According to the CAA, those rescue flights would take place between September 23 and October 6, leading to the possibility that travelers could be delayed for up to two weeks.\n\nInitial rescue flights seemed poised to begin immediately, with stranded passengers posting on Twitter saying that they were only being delayed a few hours as they awaited chartered flights.\n\nThe scale of the task has reports calling it the \u201clargest peacetime repatriation effort\u201d in British history, including the operation the government carried out when Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017.\n\nCosts of the flights were expected to be covered by the ATOL \u2013 or Air Travel Organiser\u2019s License \u2013 protection scheme, a fund which provides for repatriation of British travelers if an airline ceases operations.\n\nAirplanes from British Airways and easyJet would be among those transporting stranded passengers home, according to the Guardian, as well as chartered planes from leasing companies and other airlines. Thomas Cook Airlines\u2019 destinations included parts of mainland Europe, Africa, the US, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Airplanes were being flown to those destinations on Sunday night, according to the BBC.\n\nRead more: Singapore Airlines, one of the most ritzy airlines in the world, is partnering with a high-tech urban farm to make sure it serves the best meal on every flight. Take a look inside the futuristic operation.\n\nThe company was still selling tickets until Sunday night in the UK.\n\nOne Plymouth, England-based traveler who had booked a holiday to the Greek island Zakynthos for August 2020, told Business Insider that she saw Thomas Cook had charged her more than \u00a3600 by direct debit on Sunday afternoon for the trip \u2013 she said that she was not due to be charged until September 26th. It was unclear whether she would be able to recoup the funds with the bankruptcy declaration. She asked not to be named in this article.\n\nOn Sunday, Thomas Cook was left scrambling to secure \u00a3200 million \u2013 about $249 million \u2013 in emergency funding following a demand from its lenders. The company\u2019s executives were believed to have met Sunday with its biggest shareholder and creditors at a London law firm, according to Sky News and iTV.\n\nReports indicated that the tour operator failed to secure the needed funds during the meeting.\n\nAlthough Thomas Cook had reached an agreement for a \u00a3900 million rescue deal, with Chinese company Fosun Tourism Group providing half of that funding, creditors had demanded the British company secure an additional \u00a3200 million.\n\nThomas Cook owns a Nordic operation, as well as airlines in the UK, Germany and northern Europe \u2013 proposals to fund those, while letting the UK tour operating arm fail, were deemed unfeasible, according to Sky News, as have several other options which would take too long to implement. It was not immediately clear whether Condor was being funded separately.\n\nThomas Cook, as well as a union representing some of its 9,000 UK employees, had sought an emergency funding plan from the British government. However, government sources \u201chad questioned the financial wisdom of stepping in to save the company,\u201d according to the BBC. The company employs 21,000 globally.\n\nThe company had filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US last week, although it stopped short of declaring insolvency.\n\nAlthough Thomas Cook had managed to recover from a risk of insolvency in 2011, it continued to be held back by lingering debts. It also suffered by lower demand over the past two summer travel season, as major heatwaves led many Britons to stay home. Brexit uncertainties and a weak pound also contributed, according to the Telegraph.Monday", "description": "Business Insider - The 178-year-old tour operator failed to secure a \u00a3200 million rescue on Sunday, leading it to suspend its flights and bookings..
