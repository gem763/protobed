They collected taxes. They had this incredible online recruit presence in terms of spreading propaganda, recruiting followers,\u201d Myre said. \u201cYou know, in 2014 is when he really sort of exploded on the scene and led this group that had done something we'd never seen before.\u201d\n\nGarcia-Navarro then asked if al-Baghdadi\u2019s death meant the end of ISIS.\n\n\u201cIt's not the end of ISIS. But he was a real leader\u2026 his leadership was critical,\u201d Myre said before acknowledging the raid was \u201ca major blow to the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThe group is now scattered. There are thought to be thousands of ISIS fighters scattered around eastern Syria, western Iraq,\u201d Myre said. \u201cBut they're not in a coherent sort of way where they can wage major ongoing fights as a group.\u201d\n\nMEDIA REACTION TO BAGHDADI'S DEATH IS 'JUST STUNNING,' DISGRACEFUL, MIKE HUCKABEE SAYS\n\nEstrin chimed in, calling the raid a \u201cvery symbolic victory,\u201d but noting that ISIS can function without al-Baghdadi because recruiters are always attracting new members on social media.\n\nThe Islamic State leader detonated an explosive vest as U.S. Special Operations Forces stormed his compound in the Idrib Province. Trump said he died whimpering at the back of a dead-end tunnel.\n\nOnce NPR aired Trump\u2019s official announcement, Keith said Trump was \"spiking the football\u201d by saying the ISIS leader died a coward.\n\n\u201cI don't think we can overstate how graphic he was in describing this, talking in very specific detail about Baghdadi going into a tunnel with three children, saying that he died a coward whimpering and screaming - just truly remarkable to hear the president of the United States in some way sort of spiking the football in a very just graphic way,\u201d Keith said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cTrump is personalizing this in a pretty remarkable way. You know, with past operations, presidents if - let's say President Obama announcing the bin Laden raid. It was a very somber announcement,\" Keith said. \"He did not go into details about how the raid was carried out.\"\n\nThe NPR panel went on to criticize Trump for talking about oil during the announcement, thanking Russia and mentioning Russia \u201cin the same breath as Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post also faced criticism Sunday for initially describing Baghdadi as an \"austere religious scholar\" in the headline of a story about his death. A Washington Post separate piece written by columnist Max Boot slammed Trump for calling the deceased terrorist a \"coward.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.", "description": "National Public Radio commended Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s leadership and accused President Trump of \u201cspiking the football\u201d during an eyebrow-raising discussion Sunday about the mission that killed the wanted terrorist.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
