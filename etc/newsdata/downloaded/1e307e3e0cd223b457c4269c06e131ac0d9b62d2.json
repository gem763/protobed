(Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Elizabeth Warren had the time of her life at the Las Vegas Pride parade.\n\nCloaked in a rainbow feather boa and posing for selfies with eager fans, the Massachusetts senator was the sole presidential candidate to appear at the Friday celebration of LGBT people, which continues throughout the weekend in downtown Vegas.\n\nWaving to supporters and stopping for occasional hugs, Warren marched alongside drag artist Shea Coule\u00e9, who rose to fame on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, according to the Las Vegas Sun.\n\n\u201cThese photos of Elizabeth Warren & Shea Coulee at Vegas Pride are everything I needed this morning,\u201d tweeted one person.\n\n\u201cLooking good Madam President,\u201d one wrote on Facebook. Another said, \u201cLooking fancy with that boa!\u201d\n\nLAST NIGHT: Sen.

But she was joined by several family members of nominees. Chasten Buttigieg, husband of Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, was present, as was Jill Biden, the wife of former vice president Joe Biden.\n\nWarren\u2019s appearance at the parade comes on the heels of the latest Democratic presidential town hall earlier this week, hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation (HRC). Warren set the internet ablaze with her response to a question asked by Morgan Cox, chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, about how she would respond to someone whose faith teaches them that \u201cmarriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d\n\nHow would I respond to someone who says marriage is between one man and one woman? #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/8uNXqXI5n7 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 11, 2019\n\nIn her response, Warren said \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that. And I\u2019m going to say, \u201cThen just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that...Assuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nWarren recently released a comprehensive plan for securing LGBTQ+ rights and equality, detailing how she would work to combat issues ranging from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and workplace discrimination to reducing the number of youth experiencing homelessness and caring for LGBTQ+ elders, one-third of whom are low-income.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren had a ball at a gay pride parade in Las Vegas.", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JPOoHoKKEJGt3237lSeo0g--~B/aD0zMDUwO3c9Mzk3MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c17ec1c0-ed05-11e9-b57f-9ba26d9211dd", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
