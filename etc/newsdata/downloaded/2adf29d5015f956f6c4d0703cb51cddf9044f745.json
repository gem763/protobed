Artists like Trey Songz and Chris Brown carried adult themes back to center stage, while Janelle Mon\u00e1e created and cultivated her own technocratic world-within-a-world with her Metropolis series. All the while, there was the Drake revolution, a kind of calculated taste exercise. The warmest Drake songs \u2014 \u201cGirls Love Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d for instance \u2014 arrived couched in familiar sounds, as a teen might discover a certain sense of personal style cruising eBay for vintage band tees and recontextualizing evocative symbols in a way that the architects never intended.\n\nIn the same way that Kanye West used samples of religious music to add gravitas to his songwriting, in the same way that Disney\u2019s Hercules used the muses to give its story a layer of meta-commentary sung from inside its own margins, Drake and his right-arm producer Noah \u201c40\u201d Shebib made music quite literally informed by its elders within the meter of the beat, sad songs about the experience of listening to sad songs in a tight spot. (See also: the great country songs about stress-drinking to great country songs.) Accidentally or on purpose, the trickle of \u201990s R&B aesthetics informing songs like \u201cGirls Love Beyonc\u00e9\u201d and popular records by Drake contemporaries like singer and soul scholar Ty Dolla $ign and our resident patron saint of fed-up lovers Jhen\u00e9 Aiko \u2014 as well as successors like Bryson Tiller and Tory Lanez, whose \u201cExchange\u201d and \u201cSay It\u201d made good on the same framework\u2014 gave veteran groups a second run on the charts via sampling.\n\nR&B\u2019s new and emerging heavyweights take less direct inspiration from the intentional lines and rap cadences that sprung out of the co-mingling of trap and soul popularized by effortless hybridizers like Future and more from veterans like Mary J. Blige, writers whose songs feel less like words meant to be performed for an audience and more like diary entries or stressed-out calls for a friend\u2019s advice. One of the more successful writers of this variety is SZA, whose 2017 debut CTRL told stories about common experiences in plain terms. CTRL\u2019s \u201cDrew Barrymore\u201d is a word about second-guessing yourself and your significant other that sounds like it\u2019s spilling out in the middle of an ill-fated public gathering rather than a siloed recording studio: \u201cWhy is it so hard to accept the party is over? / You came with your new friend / And her mom jeans and her new Vans / And she\u2019s perfect, and I hate it / Oh so glad you made it.\u201d\n\nSZA\u2019s unadorned, unbridled emotion is matched by an expanding crop of albums by newcomers, including Jorja Smith, whose 2018 debut Lost and Found blended the U.K.\u2019s sleek post-genre black pop (see: \u201cTeenage Fantasy\u201d) with earthen hip-hop/soul (\u201cFebruary 3rd\u201d). Virginia vocalist Ari Lennox\u2019s warm, beguiling tone is a dead ringer for Erykah Badu on the radio, and her debut Shea Butter Baby is kin to the Texas Soulquarian\u2019s relatable approach toward matters of the heart: \u201cWhipped Cream\u201d overindulges in snacks when a fling goes south, while \u201cBroke\u201d and \u201cNew Apartment\u201d speak candidly to money matters that plagued the singer before her music earned a measure of job stability. These artists are outlining a new path for young black creatives, subverting the expectation of hardness that weighs on public figures in hip-hop. \u201cI am not your typical girl,\u201d Chicago poet and activist Jamila Woods sings on \u201cBetty,\u201d the first song on her brilliant sophomore album Legacy! Legacy! \u201cThrow away that picture in your head.\u201d The aim isn\u2019t being the coolest in the room. We all just want someone who\u2019ll stop playing games and settle down.\n\nAtlanta star Summer Walker loves music but seems to hate the industry machinery surrounding it. She looks to be bored to death in most interviews, but she\u2019s a natural on social media. She\u2019s processing fame on her own terms. The writing on Walker\u2019s debut album, Over It, which is cruising toward the top of the Billboard 200 in its first week out, is matter-of-fact to an almost startling degree. \u201cJust Might\u201d catches her wondering why relationships always end in breakups. Each verse makes the lurid chorus line \u2014 \u201cI just might be a ho\u201d \u2014 feel less like a too harsh assessment of the singer\u2019s love life and more like someone considering making an executive decision to be less vulnerable.\n\nOver It\u2019s obligatory \u201990s R&B fan service includes a killer flip of Vegas singing trio 702\u2019s \u201cGet It Together\u201d in the early highlight \u201cBody,\u201d where Walker informs a crush in line one that she has options, as if to inform you that she could be anywhere else in the world, so it\u2019s extra special that she wants to spend her time with you. \u201cCome Thru\u201d is a cuffing anthem that samples Usher\u2019s 1997 breakout jam \u201cMake Me Wanna\u201d that goes as far as calling the Atlanta legend in to update his own song in verse two. It\u2019s a fascinating choice. At 23, Walker is just a few months older than her guest\u2019s My Way album. The thing about great love songs is that as long as people keep breaking up and making up, music about the experience will never feel far away. It\u2019s not so much that these sounds are cyclical. We\u2019re the ones moving in circles.", "description": "These artists are outlining a new path for young black creatives, subverting the expectation of hardness that weighs on public figures in hip-hop.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/03/08/08-summer-walker.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
