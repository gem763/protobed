(Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nTHE KEY\n\nA group of House Republicans could have created a field day for Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies when they stormed into a secure Capitol Hill room where their colleagues were taking impeachment testimony yesterday with their cellphones in tow.\n\nThe protest, which Republicans argued was intended to bring transparency into the probe into President Trump's Ukraine policy, violated the most basic cybersecurity protections technologists try to impose on the rooms where lawmakers receive and discuss classified information \u2013 basically giving insider access to any spy agency that had compromised a single lawmaker\u2019s cellphone and could snoop through the camera or microphone.\n\n\u201cThey may have brought in the Russians and the Chinese with their electronics \u2026 They violated our oath to protect national security by bringing electronics into that room,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who was inside Sensitive Comparted Information Facility, or SCIF, at the time.\n\nMieke Eoyang, a former House Intelligence Committee staffer who managed meetings inside the same SCIF during the Obama administration, told me: \u201cThis is the kind of thing that, for people who work in national security, makes our hair stand on end.\u201d\n\nThe protest demonstrated how rank-and-file lawmakers can be one of government\u2019s biggest cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nMembers of Congress are high-value targets for Russian and Chinese hackers who routinely go after their personal devices and email accounts, but lawmakers don't get any special protection for those devices and often don\u2019t have enough training or savvy to protect them themselves.\n\nGoogle, for example, informed an unspecified number of senators that foreign hackers were targeting their gmail accounts last year.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood that there has been an active campaign by foreign actors to infiltrate their devices is highly probable,\u201d Steven VanRoekel, who was the government\u2019s top IT official during the Obama administration, told me.\n\nDespite that danger, efforts to mandate cybersecurity training for lawmakers or to add protections for their personal devices, pressed by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and others, have largely languished.\n\n\u201cMy experience with members of Congress is unless they\u2019re affirmatively taught how to be security conscious it doesn\u2019t occur to them,\u201d said Eoyang, who leads the Third Way think tank\u2019s national security program. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize what a target they are [for hackers].\u201d\n\nThe approximately two dozen conservative lawmakers seemingly stormed their way into the SCIF before a guard could collect their personal devices. Once inside, the interlopers boasted about the invasion, seeming to tweet from inside the secure room, though they later said they were sending messages to staff who were doing the actual tweeting.\n\nHere\u2019s Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who led the effort:\n\n**Tweet from Staff** \u2014 Rep. Matt Gaetz (@RepMattGaetz) October 23, 2019\n\nAnd Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.):\n\nUpdates from staff outside the room. \u2014 Rep. Mark Walker (@RepMarkWalker) October 23, 2019\n\nThe Republicans mostly surrendered their devices once they were inside the SCIF, but some refused, Swalwell told reporters. That was contradicted, however, by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who was also in the room. The House Sergeant-at-Arms, who is responsible for the chamber\u2019s cybersecurity and whose office collected the devices, declined to comment.\n\nSwalwell serves on the House Intelligence Committee and Meadows is on the House Oversight Committee, two of three committees, along with Foreign Affairs, whose members were allowed into the closed-door session.\n\nThe Republican protesters, who don\u2019t serve on any of those three committees, arrived at the SCIF right before testimony from Laura Cooper, a Pentagon official responsible for Ukraine policy, as my colleagues Elise Viebeck, Rachael Bade and Kayla Epstein reported. The fracas delayed Cooper\u2019s testimony for five hours.\n\nThe dispute also shows how Trump-allied lawmakers are mimicking the president\u2019s fast-and-loose approach to cybersecurity.\n\nTrump has refused entreaties from cybersecurity staff to regularly swap out the cellphone he uses to tweet because he considers it too inconvenient, Politico has reported.\n\nAnd his administration has devalued cybersecurity \u2014 even as intelligence agencies warn the digital threat is increasing from adversaries including Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe administration eliminated a White House cybersecurity coordinator position, which formerly led cross-government responses to major digital threats, and devalued a White House chief information security officer, or CISO, job.\n\nAt least a dozen top officials have fled from the CISO\u2019s office, including highly talented career staff who date back to the Obama administration, Axios\u2019s Alexi McCammond reported.\n\nIn many cases, those staff believe they\u2019re being forced out, according to an exit memo from Dimitrios Vastakis, who resigned in October as branch chief of the White House computer network defense, and which Alexi obtained.\n\n\u201cThe White House is posturing itself to be electronically compromised once again,\u201d the memo warned.\n\nSecurity experts were quick to slam the lawmakers who crashed the SCIF.\n\n\u201cIf people in Congress who make the laws don\u2019t follow the rules, why should anybody else?\u201d Joel Brenner, former head of U.S. counterintelligence during the Obama administration, told me. \u201cForeign intelligence agencies make a living off people who think they\u2019re too important to follow rules like this.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s John Schindler, a professor at the Naval War College and former NSA intelligence analyst:\n\nThe invasion of a SCIF by unauthorized persons isn't protest -- it's a Federal crime with serious #natsec implications. Lethal force is authorized to defend SCIFs. This isn't a joke. Next time Gaetz & his merry band of felons try this stunt, they should be ready for consequences. \u2014 John Schindler (@20committee) October 23, 2019\n\nFormer U.S. solicitor general Neal Katyal:\n\nI\u2019ve been in SCIFs a lot. The stupidest thing someone can do is bring an electronic device. You would lose your security clearance may even face criminal prosecution.

Moss:\n\nI had DOD security guards threaten to physically restrain me when I once forgot to take my phone out before I went into a secure facility.\n\n\n\nMy wife, an FSO, once threatened WH staffers lacking proper paperwork with being removed by security when they refused to get approval. \u2014 Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) October 23, 2019\n\nThere was also quick condemnation from Democratic lawmakers on Twitter.\n\nHere\u2019s Rep.

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.):\n\nAs a former prosecutor, I know that when the facts and law are not on your side, the defense attacks the process.\n\n\n\nIt's no coincidence that Republicans disregarded all rules & norms by storming the SCIF to stop interviews the day after Ambassador Taylor's devastating testimony. https://t.co/wUPopOeSJz \u2014 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) October 23, 2019\n\nYou are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news.

(Erin Scott/TPX)\n\nPINGED: Lawmakers grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the company's plan to adopt warrant-proof encryption across all its services yesterday, saying the protection will lead to more content exploiting children on the site.\n\n\u201cIf you enact end-to-end encryption, what will become of the children who will be harmed as a result?\u201d Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) asked, echoing concerns from Attorney General William P. Barr, who has pushed to make child exploitation the face of his crusade against encryption technology. Wagner cited statistics from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that end-to-end encryption could reduce Facebook reporting of sexually exploitative content involving children by 70 percent.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Ben McAdams (Utah) also raised concerns about the technology, pointing out that Facebook's encrypted messaging app WhatsApp reported just a fraction as much exploitative child content as Facebook did.\n\nZuckerberg cited tools the site is using to identify exploitative material even when it's encrypted but acknowledged that child exploitation is \u201cone of the risks ... among others to safety\u201d that encryption could pose. Technologists generally say the dangers of strong encryption are outweighed by its benefits, chiefly that it prevents hacking.\n\nThe marathon six-hour hearing before the House Financial Services Committee was ostensibly about Facebook's planned digital currency Libra but frequently veered off topic.\n\nA U.S. map. (Brian Hill/Daily Herald/AP)\n\nPATCHED: The University of Southern California is launching a project to hold public election-security training conferences in all 50 states before the 2020 contest with $2.8 million in grant money from Google, The Cybersecurity 202 has learned. Some details of the program were shared in an email to school officials this week.\n\nThe project will be similar to an earlier series of trainings in six states that USC\u2019s Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy did with the National Governor\u2019s Association and will rely on faculty from across the six schools in the USC system as well as some outside experts.\n\nThe school\u2019s goal is to tailor the workshops to each state\u2019s needs and to fill in gaps left by other training programs offered by the Department of Homeland Security and state agencies. For example, the school may offer training in legal issues surrounding data protection or crisis communications after a digital attack, in addition to traditional cybersecurity training.\n\nThe workshops will all take place between January and October 2020 and the school may hold multiple workshops in some states if timing and funding allow.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nPWNED: The House passed its third major election security bill yesterday in a 227-to-181 vote that basically broke along party lines. The White House has already condemned the bill, which would require campaigns to report foreign government contacts to the FBI and increase transparency guidelines for online political ads.\n\nThe bill will be particularly unpalatable for Trump, who has rejected traditional norms about not accepting campaign dirt from foreigners, saying he might look at information before deciding.\n\n\u201cStopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy\u201d/SHIELD Act would lead to over-reporting and \u201cfruitless inquiries,\u201d the White House said in a statement to Bloomberg News\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs.\n\nWhite House says it opposes passage of bill that would require campaigns to self-report foreign contact to FBI and FEC within a week.\n\n\n\n\u201cStopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy\u201d/SHIELD Act would lead to over-reporting and \u201cfruitless inquiries,\u201d WH says. \u2014 Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) October 23, 2019\n\nThe bill also is unlikely to see a future in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has staunchly opposed any new election security mandates. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) tried to introduce a Senate version of the bill yesterday but Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) blocked the attempt.\n\nHere's more from The Hill's Maggie Miller.\n\nCHAT ROOM\n\nAre you tired of cybersecurity news articles with stock images of glowing keyboards and shadowy guys in hoodies?
