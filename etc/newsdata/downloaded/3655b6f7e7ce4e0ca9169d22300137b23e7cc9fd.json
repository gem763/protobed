You have a bigger base. When you have one group that's leading and everything else is left behind it's easy to lose that one group, and you hit an air pocket,\" said Scott Redler, technical analyst and partner with T3Live.com. \"When you have a lot of groups and they're taking turns, it's harder to break the back of the bull.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 ended Thursday at 3,009, up 8, and just 0.6% away from its all-time high. The Dow, which is also less than a percent from its high, ended at 27,182, up 0.2%. The S&P's high from late July was 3,027.98, and Redler said it would be a positive if it can continue to hold above the psychological 3,000 level.\n\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 ended off by less than a point at 1,575, but it is up 4.6% for the week, in its best weekly performance so far since January.\n\nStocks are powering higher amid positive developments in the trade wars, with U.S. officials preparing to meet Chinese counterparts next month. Analysts have said the market's run higher could be disrupted if there is negative news on the trade front. For now, both the U.S. and China have held off on some new tariffs in a show of good faith.\n\nTrading in recent sessions has been markedly different than in other phases of the bull market. Value stocks, or those less loved and with lower price-to-earnings ratios, have been gaining favor. At the same time, the momentum stock winners underperformed, though some are moving higher after falling at the beginning of the week.\n\n\"I think the general view out there is growth and value are mutually exclusive ideas. I disagree. I think they can work in tandem,\" said Chris Verrone, Strategas Research head of technical strategy. \"We call that a broader market.\"\n\nA number of those momentum names were higher Thursday, including Visa, up 2.3%, and Mastercard, up 2.4%, and the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF was up 1.4%. At the same time, the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF IVE had been moving opposite momentum, but it was slightly higher in afternoon trading.\n\nSome strategists say the big rotation, which was not so obvious in Thursday's trading, was kicked off by the belief that interest rates are rising after finding a bottom this summer. The 10-year yield Thursday was at 1.78%, just weeks after hitting a low of 1.42%.
