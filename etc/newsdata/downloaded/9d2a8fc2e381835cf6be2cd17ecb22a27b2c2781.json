It has also been suggested that the dress code for foreign females is going to be relaxed.\n\nUntil recently, visas to Saudi Arabia have been restricted to religious pilgrims, business travellers and expat workers. Each year Mecca received 3.7 million Muslims for the Hajj and millions more for the Umrah.\n\nBut last year the conservative state began making efforts to woo international tourists. In October 2018 its government unveiled the \u201cSharek\u201d visa, a short-term 14-day pass allowing foreign visitors to enter the country to attend a specific event.\n\nIt is believed the new visa arrangements announced today will further relax restrictions.\n\n\u201cOpening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,\u201d tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.\n\n\u201cVisitors will be surprised by the treasures we have to share \u2013 five Unesco World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty.\u201d\n\nMillions of Muslims travel to Mecca every year Credit: Getty More\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s tourism drive began in 2017, when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman revealed his \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan \u2013 a scheme devised to shift the nation\u2019s economy away from its reliance on oil and towards other markets.\n\nBin Salman has been labelled a \u201creformer prince\u201d after the softening of other policies; Saudi women can now travel and drive without permission from a male guardian, for example.\n\nAs part of the new tourism policy, foreign women will be able to visit the country unaccompanied for the first time. They will reportedly not be required to wear the full-body abaya robe that Saudi women are required to wear, but must still dress modestly.\n\nNon-Muslims will still not be allowed to visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and the nationwide alcohol ban will remain in place.\n\nIn a public announcement last month, the 33-year-old crown prince claimed that by 2030 tourism will contribute 10 per cent of Saudi Arabia\u2019s gross domestic product, a figure that would likely amount to over $100 billion and would make it one of the world\u2019s top five tourism destinations.\n\nIn the last 24 hours Saudi Arabia has launched a Twitter page, @VisitSaudiNow. The account has sent out three tweets with the hashtag #WelcomeToArabia.\n\nPart of bin Salman\u2019s 2030 project is to create a tourism hub nearly twice the size of Wales on its unspoilt Red Sea coastline. An official statement explained that the transformed area will cover some 34,000 square kilometres between the cities of Umluf and Alwajh, including its 50 islands, and be governed by laws \u201con par with international standards\u201d.\n\nIt is not only glitzy resorts that Saudi Arabia has promised. There are plans in place to build a $500 billion megacity called \u201cNeom\u201d in the economically neglected northwest of the country.\n\nA report leaked to the Wall Street Journal shared proposals of robots outnumbering humans, \u201chologram teachers\u201d, and cloud seeding in the city. According to the planning documents, bin Salman \u201cenvisions Neom the largest city globally by GDP\u201d. While some construction workers have arrived in the area\u2019s small towns and some building work has started, it is still unknown just how viable the new megacity is and when it will come to fruition.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Saudi Arabia is opening its doors to international tourists for the first time in what ministers have described as a \u201chistoric moment\u201d.", "authors": ["Greg Dickinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wl2iBm1Ui4QtGQaCQgc3FA--~B/aD0xMjI2O3c9MTk2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/250cdd9961041d3b0f665ce7db1a531c", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
