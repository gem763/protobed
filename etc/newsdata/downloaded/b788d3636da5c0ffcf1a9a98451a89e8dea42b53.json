Blame Emery.\"\n\nAnother stated: \"I\u2019m honestly ashamed watching videos of fans shouting abuse at Aubameyang as he attempted to drive home after the match on Sunday.\n\n\"Arguably our most dependable performer, who knows where we\u2019d be without him. He deserves much, much better than that. We\u2019re sorry, @Aubameyang7 .\"\n\nAubameyang has already found the back of the net eight times in 12 games this term, but reports suggest he could opt to leave the club this summer in search of Champions League football if they cannot get back into the top four.\n\nAnother fan added: \"Weird she\u2019s shouting it at the player that\u2019s bailed us out on numerous occasions already this season.\"\n\nSunday's draw leaves the Gunners four points adrift of fourth placed Chelsea having missed a major opportunity with two slip-ups in their last two Premier League games.\n\n(Image: PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe Gunners will take on Liverpool in Carabao Cup action tonight (Wednesday) with Xhaka and Aubameyang amongst those who have not travelled to Anfield.\n\nMesut Ozil is in the frame to make his first appearance since the win over Nottingham Forest in the last round as Emery rings the changes and hands several fringe players in his squad a chance to impress.", "description": "The abuse came after Granit Xhaka's emotional reaction to being booed off by Arsenal fans against Crystal Palace on Sunday", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20754702.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-072645.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
