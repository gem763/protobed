The \u201cUltimate Fighter\u201d alum says the prospect of fighting twice in one night in the quarterfinals, then the semifinals, holds no fear for him. Indeed, he thinks it might be preferable to the tournament format he endured in the \u201cTUF\u201d house.\n\n\u201cThe one-night thing is a little bit different. It\u2019s a little bit more primal, but I almost feel like (the fights are) so close together,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the \u2018TUF\u2019 house, when you go home and you have to fight five days later, and you got caught in a brutal fight \u2013 that\u2019s hard, because you go home, you have time for your soreness to set in, your bruises to set in.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s going to be hard (in the PFL playoffs), but I don\u2019t go home and I\u2019m not going to think about it. I\u2019m going to be there in the action, probably watching the other fights. I\u2019m just excited to do it.\u201d\n\nNijem admitted he cranked up the intensity during his weigh-in day staredown with the amiable Schulte (17-3-1 MMA, 6-0-1 PFL) in a bid to break the Brazilian out of his relaxed frame of mind.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s friendly, so I made sure to be a little bit intense in the staredown and I brought out his intensity a little bit,\u201d Nijem said. \u201cI was just excited. I want to see that beast and I want to tame it.\u201d\n\nNijem said the quarterfinal draw may turn out to be a favorable one for him. He faces fellow grappler Schulte, while two Russian strikers, Akhmet Aliev and Rashid Magomedov, do battle on the other side of their bracket.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to fight a grappler first, then I\u2019ll fight the winner of Aliev and Rashid, who are two strikers are probably going to put on a firefight and come out with a little bit more damage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little bit less strikes thrown between me and Schulte because we\u2019re both very strong grapplers who will want to show whose grappling is better.\u201d\n\nNow a seasoned veteran of the fight game, Nijem says he\u2019s enjoying the most profitable time of his career as part of the PFL, and says he\u2019s only just coming into his prime.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting some of the biggest paychecks I\u2019ve ever had in my career right now, and that\u2019s pretty awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy because I took a bit of a layoff and waited for the right promotion. I\u2019m grateful the PFL came through and signed me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m 31, man, and I\u2019m getting stronger than I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m more able to train my own mind. I go do my yoga, I\u2019m super healthy, super strong, and I\u2019ve got a healthy lifestyle now. So I feel better than I\u2019ve ever felt. I didn\u2019t hit puberty until I was 19 in college. So I\u2019m a late bloomer. I\u2019m excited for it. It just feels pressure-free. It\u2019s just fun again, to be honest.\u201d\n\nAnd with the pressure off and a positive mindset, Nijem says he\u2019s ready to give reigning PFL champ Schulte all he can handle on fight night.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s young, he\u2019s tough or whatever, but I\u2019m (expletive) gritty,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a veteran who has been fighting the best guys in the world since I was 21 years old. He\u2019s fighting the best right now, but he\u2019s still learning how to fight. I\u2019ve learned my game. I know what I\u2019m going to do in a fight. I have over 10 years of professional fighting with the biggest leagues in the world, so I know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d", "description": "Ramsey Nijem, a 10-fight UFC veteran, says he's in the best shape of his life heading into the PFL playoffs in Las Vegas.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "George Garcia", "Dave Doyle", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-ramsey-nijem.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
