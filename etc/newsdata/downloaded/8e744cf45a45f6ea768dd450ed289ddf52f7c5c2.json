It has made few investments so far, and both the Conservatives and the NDP have promised to shut it down if they win the federal election.\n\nThe documents prepared for Lavall\u00e9e, however, suggest a wide array of potential telecom investments, including 5G in urban areas, public Wi-Fi and Next-Generation 9-1-1 services.\n\nThe October 2018 briefing note, written by then-head of investments Nicholas Hann, was also sent to board chair Janice Fukakusa. It recommends that the government\u2019s current spending on telecommunications \u2014 much of which subsidizes projects from the private sector \u2014 be entirely stopped.\n\n\u201cThis existing spend could be used as the basis for a holistic public utility model which in turn could cheaply be expanded for retail consumer use,\u201d reads the briefing.\n\nIn particular, the report argues, a public utility would be more efficient for building rural infrastructure than paying private companies to do so. The federal Liberals have allocated $536.6 million since 2016 to subsidize rural infrastructure built almost entirely by private telecommunications companies.\n\n\u201cA scale approach accordingly renders economic rural infrastructure which under a profit maximizing ROI approach would not be built,\u201d the briefing says.\n\nCIB did not directly reply to questions regarding whether it plans to launch a public utility or is still interested in making any of the specific investments listed in the report.\n\n\u201cWhile we can\u2019t comment on any specific project for commercial sensitivity reasons, we are open to governments and investors bringing forward proposals,\u201d said F\u00e9lix Corriveau, senior director of media relations at the bank. \u201cThis internal note is a year old by a former CIB employee and that context matters.\u201d The report\u2019s author, Hann, left in July after 10 months on the job. He did not have another job lined up when he left, and said he would be willing to return if things changed \u2014 a move some in the industry took as a criticism of the bank\u2019s leadership. Hann did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nJonathan Dignan, a spokesperson for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, said the Liberal government has been working with the bank.\n\n\u201cWe have met with representatives of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank to see how we could find synergies in our work,\u201d said Dignan. \u201cWe look forward to the CIB helping to bring better connectivity and lower prices to Canadians across the country.\u201d\n\nThe CRTC did not directly reply to questions about its relationship with the CIB.\n\nPublic utilities like Ontario Hydro and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec are relatively common in the electricity industry. Government-owned telecommunications companies used to be prominent in Canada, but have largely been privatized. Telus, for example, used to be a Crown corporation known as Alberta Government Telephones, but was privatized in 1990. Manitoba privatized the Manitoba Telephone System in 1997.\n\nIn addition to a public utility, the document suggests a \u201cholistic\u201d approach to telecom investing, which could yield \u201chuge potential economic benefits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most basic policy question is should telecommunications infrastructure be a regulated public utility based on open access infrastructure,\u201d the briefing reads.\n\n\u201cThis would enable infrastructure to be common use and benefit from economies of scale including a low utility cost of capital. This in turn would allow broadband and potentially mobile coverage to extend into rural areas far beyond where a commercial carrier would typically cover without subsidy.\u201d\n\nThe briefing warns that political, policy and commercial constraints make a holistic solution unlikely, but states that those principles should guide how the bank approaches the telecom sector generally. It suggests CIB make investments in the following areas: 5G for urban areas; upgrading 3G and 4G for rural areas; public Wi-Fi; telecommunications services for governments, schools and hospitals; public safety radio and LTE communications; and Next-Generation 9-1-1 services. The last feature allows people to send texts, photos and videos to emergency services.\n\nThe CIB report is one of several circulating that suggest there have been discussions in Ottawa about significant changes to the telecom sector. In November 2018, The Logic reported on a secret government analysis that found no downside to making Bell, Rogers and Telus compete with foreign firms. In July, The Logic broke the news that Google was asking the Canadian government to make it easier to set up a rival telecom.\n\nThe federal Liberals have also made a number of public moves to facilitate competition and lower costs in the sector. In their March 2019 budget, the Liberals directed the CIB to invest up to $1 billion over the next decade to increase broadband access for Canadians. In June, Bains ordered the CRTC to place consumer interests at the forefront of its decisions. During the federal election, the Liberals promised to cut cellphone and wireless bills by 25 per cent, working in cooperation with telecom companies.\n\nThe CIB report, by contrast, suggests a less collaborative approach to working with telecom firms, particularly when it comes to building 5G infrastructure.\n\n5G infrastructure will require \u201cintensive use\u201d of often publicly owned infrastructure such as streetlights and \u201csidewalk furniture,\u201d according to the report. \u201cAt full density 5G would require a radio transmitter on every 4th streetlight (200ft) connected to an underground fibre optic cable.\u201d\n\nCurrently, municipalities provide telecoms access to public real estate, which the firms then use to build infrastructure and sell services to residents.\n\n\u201cMany municipalities large and small are frustrated with this dynamic, are starting to realize the full value of their real estate and the anti-competitive potential outcomes of giving up rights.\u201d\n\nThe report notes Calgary and Ottawa as some cities \u201clooking to build their own municipal broadband utility infrastructure often using municipal owned electric or water utilities.\u201d Publicly owned broadband is running in a number of municipalities, including Stratford, Ont. and Campbell River, B.C.\n\nThe Logic", "description": "The CIB report is one of several circulating that suggest discussions in Ottawa about significant changes to the telecom sector", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/celltower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
