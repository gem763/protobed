We spend two days clambering into sandy nooks embraced by limestone walls pockmarked by wind and sea; climbing into circular rock pools big enough for two. Six months later we are back, this time accompanied by our best man and his girlfriend. We climb the highest point of the white sand dunes, the best place in the Cape to count the southern right whales that return annually to this shoreline to nurse their young. Bathed in sun, the blue horizon before us, I feel overwhelmed; on the cusp of a life I had always dreamed of. On the way back to our car I pick three everlastings for my wedding bouquet, wanting to hold a piece of De Hoop close to my heart when I declare my intentions to the tall, curly-haired man beside me.\n\nWork, birth, work, travel, work. After a happy sojourn in London, we elect to move back to the UK. I return to Cape Town to pack up, but when a girlfriend suggests a weekend in De Hoop I leapt at the chance to introduce our firstborn, now two, to its sheltered coves and rock pools. But once there, I am unable to eat or drink. Awoken by the bird chorus at dawn, the realisation hits me. Our second daughter is making her presence felt inside me, and Africa is where I want to raise her.\n\nThe next time we return is with my in-laws, flown south to meet their new grandchild. We book one of the new cottages built on a prime spot overlooking the vlei. To date facilities had been rudimentary; now bedding is supplied; the kitchen equipped. It is the first time we have lived together on neutral territory, sharing the cosy intimacy of meeting over an unfamiliar kettle in our dressing gowns.", "description": "", "authors": ["Pippa De Bruyn"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/de-hoop-trail-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
