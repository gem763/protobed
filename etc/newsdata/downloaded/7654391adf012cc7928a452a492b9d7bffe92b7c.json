Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u201cC\u201d Subpoena! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nClinton later fired back:\n\nDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 8, 2019\n\nIn the interview with Woodruff, Clinton said it \u201ctruly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me but this latest tweet is so typical of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails, we all know that. So, he\u2019s either lying or delusional, or both,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere was no subpoena as he says in a tweet this morning, so, maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know, just, seriously, I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t think anybody understands, what motivates him other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation,\u201d she added.\n\nCheck out the interview below. Clinton\u2019s comments are around the 38:45 mark.", "description": "\"Maybe there does need to be a rematch.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d8ffd200000da064fe559.jpeg?cache=9l4kllygx6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
