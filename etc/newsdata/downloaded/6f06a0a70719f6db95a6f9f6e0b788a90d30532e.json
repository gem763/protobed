People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth.

My parents were as far from climate activists as possible before I made them aware of the situation\u201d.\n\nMr Trump, a notorious climate sceptic, took issue with her remarks at the UN, retweeting the video of her speech and sarcastically writing: \u201cShe seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!\u201d\n\nGreta responded by changing her Twitter biography to read: \u201cA very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.\u201d\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has accused her of failing to understand the realities of \u201ccomplex\u201d world. \u201cWhen someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl. But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.\u201d\n\nWill Greta Thunberg win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nIf Greta is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize next week, she would be the youngest recipient of the prestigious award, which has previously been won by the likes of Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama.\n\nShe would also be the first person to win the prize for environmental work since Al Gore, the former US vice president, who shared it with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue against the impact Thunberg\u2019s actions have had globally, and that\u2019s reflected in her odds as the favourite to win the Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d said Ladbrokes spokesperson Jessica O\u2019Reilly.\n\nOther candidates tipped to win the award include the Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed, Native Brazilian environmental leader Raoni Metuktire and New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern.\n\nGreta was nominated for the award by three Norwegian MPs earlier this year.\n\n\u201cGreta Thunberg has launched a mass movement which I see as a major contribution to peace,\u201d said Norwegian Socialist MP Freddy Andre Ovstegard.", "description": "Swedish environment activist\u00a0Greta Thunberg\u00a0is being tipped to win the Nobel Peace Prize\u00a0following a remarkable year in which the teenager\u2019s \u201cschool strike for climate\u201d\u00a0movement has grown to worldwide prominence.
