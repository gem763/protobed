On Wednesday he extended it by thirty days, citing legal provisions and consultations with the prime minister and head of parliament.\n\nThey want to make us live with horror but we are going to bring that horror to the terrorist camps.\n\nIn a televised speech, the president said: \u201cWe are at war and we are going to win.\u201d\n\nHe also declared an evening to morning curfew.\n\nOnly one month ago, exceptional security measures were lifted. Now Essebsi reinstated them.\n\nJust days before his guards were attacked, he had been in Paris offering moral support after the Nov. 13th attacks there.\n\nParis, he recalled, had stood by Tunis when the Bardo National Museum in the Tunisian capital was attacked in March this year. Three terrorists with Kalashnikovs opened fire on tourists, killing 21 people, and wounding many more. The radical group ISIL said it was behind the attack.\n\nThree months later, in June, at the tourist resort of Port El Kantaoui, near Sousse, a single gunman killed 38 mostly British tourists, also armed with a Kalashnikov. This was modern Tunisia\u2019s deadliest attack. ISIL claimed this one, too.\n\nThe gunman was a 23-year-old electrical engineering student who had known the Bardo museum killers. Like many Tunisians, he is thought to have chosen the path of radicalisation in the chaos of Libya.\n\nThis neighbour state undermines Tunisia\u2019s fragile democracy, the only country to have managed the transition from the Arab Spring uprising in 2011 with any success. And yet Tunisia\u2019s economy deteriorated, the lower and middle classes suffered, and disillusionment set in.\n\nTunisia is thought to be the biggest source of recruits joining the jihadists in Libya, Syria and Iraq. Some have threatened to carry out attacks at home. The army has also been fighting against Islamist militants in the mountains near the Algerian border.\n\nThe government says it is determined to finish a defensive barrier along 168 kilometres of its border with Libya by the end of this year. The project was launched after the Sousse killings.\n\nIn September, Tunis said intelligence pointed to possible car bombings in the capital. This month, authorities arrested 17 militants and said they had prevented another major assault, planned for November, again in Sousse.", "description": "Immediately after the deadly bombing of his presidential guard in the heart of the capital on Tuesday (Nov. 24th), Tunisian President Beji Caid", "authors": ["Adrian Lancashire"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/317740/1000x563_317740.jpg", "published_at": "2015-11-25"}
