The panels have demanded a transcript of the July phone call.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the call is linked to a secret complaint from a whistleblower in the intelligence community reportedly concerning Trump and a troubling \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader. The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that at least part of the complaint involved Ukraine.\n\nIf this actually happened, @realDonaldTrump should be impeached and removed from office without delay. https://t.co/WkiA3yXPEx \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) September 19, 2019\n\nGiuliani said in a CNN interview Thursday with Chris Cuomo that \u201cof course\u201d he recently pressed Ukrainian officials to investigative Biden.\n\n\u201cSo you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u201d Cuomo asked.\n\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Giuliani answered. But then he clarified: \u201cI didn\u2019t ask them to look into Joe Biden. I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client [Trump], which tangentially involved Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said Trump had \u201cevery right\u201d to tell Zelensky to investigate corruption \u2014 though he insisted he didn\u2019t know if the president did so.\n\nTrump has been calling for an investigation into Biden\u2019s connections to Ukraine since a Times report in May. According to the newspaper, the former vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees in 2016 until Ukraine removed a prosecutor Biden had accused of doing nothing to fight corruption in the nation. But the prosecutor, who was removed, had been investigating an energy company whose board members included Biden\u2019s son, the Times reported.\n\nIf the report in The Independent is true, pressure by Trump on the Ukrainian leader would mean a U.S. president essentially invited a foreign power to investigate an American citizen, which would benefit the president\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nIn June Trump said he didn\u2019t see anything wrong with accepting negative information about a political rival from a foreign power. \u201cIt\u2019s not an interference,\u201d the president told George Stephanopoulus on ABC. \u201cThey have the information! I think I\u2019d take it.\u201d", "description": "The lawyer says the president should be ousted \"without delay\" if a report is true that Trump told Ukraine's president to investigate the 2020 Democrat.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d84530c2300005700cf441e.jpeg?cache=ypto96lt6j&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
