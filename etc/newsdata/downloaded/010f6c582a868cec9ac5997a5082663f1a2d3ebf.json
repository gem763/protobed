State Department employee was allegedly a white supremacist", "language": "en", "text": "More than 100 homeowners in Greenway Farms, a Loudoun County neighborhood, put these signs on their lawns after they learned the president of their homeowners\u2019 association was identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white supremacist who hosted white supremacism meetings at his home. (Petula Dvorak/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nThe president of their Leesburg, Va., homeowners\u2019 association, as far as his neighbors knew, was all about the mundane issues of suburbia:\n\n\u201cStray cats, Ash and other trees, snakes, large trash containers, development, fees for townhomes vs. single family, pool expense, sidewalk and bus stop snow removal,\u201d were the items listed on the agenda that the president, Matthew Q. Gebert, 38, signed off on in the January minutes of the Greenway Farms Homeowners\u2019 Association meeting.\n\nHis house on their Northern Virginia cul-de-sac is lovely, already decorated for Halloween and complies with all the association\u2019s mandates to have the bushes and hedges neatly trimmed. The house paint is within the Duron Curb Appeal approved color palette. There are car seats, a pink tricycle and chalk drawings signaling the presence of children.\n\nBut those neighbors didn\u2019t know about the swastika-shaped cookies Gebert allegedly served at his private parties, where he hosted some of the white nationalist movement\u2019s key players.\n\nOr about his lively online presence as \u201cCoach Finstock,\u201d where he allegedly pledged his loyalty to white nationalism and said black people should be separated from whites by \u201can ocean at least.\u201d\n\nAnd they definitely didn\u2019t know that he allegedly marched at the bloody white nationalist demonstration in Charlottesville.\n\n\n\nThe former homeowners\u2019 association president, Matthew Q. Gebert, 38, allegedly marched at the white nationalist demonstration in Charlottesville in 2017. (Evelyn Hockstein/for The Washington Post)\n\n[Trump lit the torches of white supremacy in Charlottesville]\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right here, in a neighborhood with mixed-race couples,\u201d said one of Gebert\u2019s neighbors, Maggie Curtin, 20, who signaled her disapproval with a sign in her front yard: \u201cHate Has No Home Here.\u201d\n\nGebert\u2019s extracurricular activities surfaced at the peak of community pool season last month, when the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Hatewatch came out with a bombshell report about their mild-mannered president, identifying a raft of online activity they allegedly linked to him and identifying him from a photo at the Charlottesville hate march.\n\n\u201cHere? That\u2019s shocking to me, I have to say,\u201d said a grandfather sitting on a park bench while his grandchild played at the neighborhood park that Gebert was instrumental in creating. \u201cThis is just not that kind of place.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what they all thought. And it\u2019s among the most insidious aspects of the nation\u2019s white supremacist movement.\n\nThey live among us. They don\u2019t have claws or horns, they usually don\u2019t snarl. The peddlers of hatred are hidden in plain sight.\n\n\u201cBut the ideas aren\u2019t new,\u201d said Cameron Hohenschutz, 20, an infantryman for the Virginia National Guard and recruiter for the local fire department. \u201cAnti-Semitism is so 1940s,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy just hasn\u2019t adjusted to this world. It\u2019s like his mind-set is trapped in a time warp. This isn\u2019t about politics. He\u2019s talking about our community.\u201d\n\n[Got a white teen? Look out, the Nazis are recruiting him]\n\nGebert didn\u2019t only front as a model neighbor and community leader. He\u2019s a government official who studied in Ukraine, met his wife in Russia and graduated from George Washington University. Until last month, he was a foreign affairs officer with the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Energy Resources, according to the law center. He\u2019s been suspended from his job after that SPLC report came out in August, according to Politico. The State Department didn\u2019t return my request for an update on his status this week.\n\nGebert also didn\u2019t respond. I sent requests to all his emails for comment and didn\u2019t hear back. I went to his house and rang the bell, no one answered. But someone quickly closed the open garage door after I walked off. I left a note and never heard back.\n\nHis wife, Anna Vuckovic, is allegedly Wolfie James online, the alt-right warrior complaining about what a \u201ccesspool\u201d she lives in (in Leesburg, a town that\u2019s 75 percent white, and the seat of a county that\u2019s 67 percent white) and cooing about how sexy her alpha-male husband is when he\u2019s up late at night spreading hatred online. She used to work for the local tourism bureau. She\u2019s not on their homepage anymore.\n\nGebert resigned after the homeowners\u2019 association held an emergency meeting about the report last month, according to their latest minutes.\n\nOne of the board members of the association \u201cwas visibly shaking\u201d when she read it online, when she saw the profanities in his alleged posts, the screen-grabbed photos of those swastika cookies, a friend of the board member told me.\n\n\u201cAll these people are like, \u2018My kids played with their kids!\u2019 \u201d Curtin, the 20-year-old who grew up in Leesburg, told me. \u201cNo one thought someone living here is really thinking like this.\u201d\n\n[Alleged white nationalists are right here, in liberal D.C.]\n\nSo the folks of Greenway Farms broke their HOA rules about lawn decorations (seasonal are okay during appropriate times, anything else needs approval) en masse, responding with a silent protest. The neighborhood sprouted nearly 150 of those Hate Has No Home signs. Leesburg resident Peter Fedders bought them and helped give them out.\n\nHe said it turned into a community-building party, with face-painting, snacks and lots of disbelief. \u201cEveryone had their own stories about the Geberts, how shocked they all were.\u201d\n\nFedders, however, wasn\u2019t shocked by the idea that an amicable man beloved by so many may have a dark side.\n\n\u201cJust look at my dad. He was abusing my mom for 17 years,\u201d said Fedders, son of Charlotte Fedders, whose best-selling book, \u201cShattered Dreams,\u201d described the violent abuse by her husband, Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement director John M. Fedders. It was made into a movie starring Lindsey Wagner.\n\n\u201cEveryone always said how sad that was, what a nice guy my dad seemed to be,\u201d Fedders said. \u201cSo no, this doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "description": "A Leesburg community is stunned that their homeowner\u2019s association president \u2014 who worked at the State Department \u2014 allegedly embraced white nationalism.", "authors": ["Petula Dvorak", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qL2SddIO6PuOnd-DiFRlhdCJO_U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CG2CTEXAOEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
