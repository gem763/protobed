It felt like defeat. But I am a firm believer in the law of attraction and manifesting,\" she said.\n\nShe continued: \u201cThat March, I was on Instagram and SI posted their first-ever open casting call. It said, \u2018Are you the next Chrissy Teigen? The next Kate Upton? Then submit a 60-minute video telling us why.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Screw the agencies, I\u2019m doing this myself.\u201d\n\nSI SWIMSUIT MODEL CAMILLE KOSTEK SAYS IT CAN BE DIFFICULT DEALING WITH BODY-SHAMING TROLLS: \u2018WORDS DO HURT\u2019\n\nBut the cover girl admitted she didn\u2019t always feel so confident about her curves. In fact, Kostek told Ocean Drive it was difficult to find someone she could easily identify with.\n\nSPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT MODEL CAMILLE KOSTEK HEATS UP IN BIKINI SNAPS\n\n\u201cGrowing up, it was hard to associate with some of the women who were being portrayed in the media,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was a girl with freckles and grew into a young woman a little bit more quickly, with hips and thighs. It wasn\u2019t until I picked up an issue of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit at 15 where I was like, \u2018Whoa! If I ever were to be a model, this is what I would want to do.\u2019\u201d\n\n\"I was like, \u2018Screw the agencies, I\u2019m doing this myself.'\" \u2014 Camille Kostek\n\n\u201cLooking at the women, I was like, \u2019She\u2019s got freckles, she\u2019s got hips, she\u2019s got thighs. Her boobs look natural,\u2019\u201d Kostek continued. \u201cThat always stuck with me. When I finished school in 2015, I started going to open calls in New York. But I was getting the same response every time: \u2018Get your measurements down.\u2019 \u2019Take X inches off your thighs and hips.\u2019\u201d\n\nSPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT MODEL CAMILLE KOSTEK GETS CANDID ON DATING ROB GRONKOWSKI: \u2018IT JUST FEELS GOOD\u2019\n\nBut the former Patriots cheerleader marched on despite being told to first lose weight and then gain some more just to land gigs. And her efforts paid off.\n\nIn May of this year, Sports Illustrated named Kostek as one of its coveted models for its swimsuit edition. Kostek joined Tyra Banks, 45, and soccer star Alex Morgan, 29.\n\nELIZABETH HURLEY, 54, MODELS THE LATEST BIKINIS FROM HER SWIMWEAR LINE\n\n\u201cWhen the cover was announced, I called my mom,\u201d said Kostek. \u201cI didn\u2019t call an agency to say thank you for getting me here. I thanked her. Throughout the entire process, my body never really changed. My relationship with myself, my colleagues, my boyfriend\u2026 everything got better.\u201d\n\nThese days, Kostek is determined to be a role model for others struggling to accept their bodies, no matter their size.\n\nSPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT MODEL CAMILLE KOSTEK FELT INSECURE OVER HER CURVES: 'IT'S DISCOURAGING'\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s my duty to share my experience with self-acceptance,\u201d Kostek told the outlet. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bore people and talk about myself, but the biggest struggle for me was my body. I\u2019m an advocate for self-acceptance and I want to what I\u2019ve found and what might help others. I started with women\u2019s panels and extended to universities. I want to reach out to everyone. Men, women, the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nBut with all the success Kostek achieved, she\u2019s thankful to have retired tight end Rob Gronkowski as a supportive boyfriend.\n\nKostek previously shared she was introduced to Gronkowski after she quit the squad in March 2015. For months, the pair denied having a romantic relationship, though they started posting loving photos of one another on Instagram.\n\nROB GRONKOWSKI RAVES ABOUT GIRLFRIEND CAMILLE KOSTEK LANDING SI SWIMSUIT COVER: \u2018CONGRATS BABY\u2019\n\nBy fall 2015, the pair were celebrating birthdays together, attending red carpet events arm in arm and publicly supporting each other\u2019s endeavors. Kostek was frequently spotted in the stands among New England fans \u2013 even sporting Gronkowski\u2019s jersey \u2013 in 2016, according to E! News.\n\nIn February 2017, a TMZ report claimed the duo had split and Gronkowski had \u201cmoved on.\u201d But Kostek contradicted the news by posting photos of herself sporting his jersey. They also attended a wedding together three months later, per E! News.\n\nSPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT 2019 DEBUT: CAMILLE KOSTEK, TYRA BANKS AND ALEX MORGAN NAMED COVER MODELS\n\n\u201cWe both admire each other,\u201d said Kostek. \u201cI always get asked what it\u2019s like dating an NFL player, and for as much as I love watching him play football, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s best known for, I see what goes on behind the scenes \u2013 going back to his hometown and getting to know his family and being by his side through injuries and everything else. I\u2019m a firm believer of \u2018work in silence, let your success speak.\u2019 And he does the same thing.\u201d\n\nIn August of this year, Kostek admitted to Fox News it\u2019s not always easy being in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get spiraled into our phones, the computer screens and read these comments about yourself in the comment sections of photos or articles,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cAnd definitely in the modeling world, it\u2019s heightened. The trolls come through even more. It can be super hard. You could have 900 people telling you that you look incredible, that you\u2019re an inspiration. But you could have two people telling you something negative about your body or personality and that will bother you.\u201d\n\nELIZABETH HURLEY RECREATES ICONIC 1994 VERSACE PIN DRESS\n\n\u201cI just think that as much as we say sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me \u2014 words do hurt,\u201d continued the 27-year-old. \u201cHurtful words hurt people\u2026 [But] people who don\u2019t know you also don\u2019t define you. We already understand what like and what we don\u2019t like about our bodies. We are already hard on ourselves. We don\u2019t need people to try to tell us who we are.\u201d\n\nKostek insisted that like anyone else, she has her own insecurities. But rather than responding to negative comments, she prefers to use her social media for a good cause, in hopes it will uplift someone who could use some much-needed encouragement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI always seek the time to talk to people who are reaching out for help because sometimes you just need that one person to tell you everything is going to be OK,\u201d said Kostek. \u201cAnd I like to share some of the things that I deal with\u2026 to remind people that I hear them too.\u201d", "description": "Before Camille Kostek was named\u00a0Sports Illustrated Swimsuit\u2019s\u00a0newest cover girl,\u00a0she struggled to be accepted as a model.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco", "Camille Kostek"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/07/15/694940094001_6059386359001_6059386138001-vs.jpg"}
