The government pledged a \u20ac150m loan to help the low-cost carrier in August 2017, after Etihad Airways withdrew funding after years of losses.\n\nLast week Air Berlin\u2019s liquidator confirmed the carrier had repaid the loan. Though it has not found a buyer, the loan has reduced damages for passengers, employees and business partners.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Cook GmbH, the German subsidiary of Thomas Cook, also filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company said it was forced to take the step to free itself from financial entanglements and liabilities after its parent company filed for insolvency on Monday.\n\nThomas Cook GmbH said it would restructure the business and run it independently. \u201cOf course we would have liked to avoid this legal step,\u201d said the chief executive, Stefanie Berk. \u201cBut sadly no short-term solution could be reached in our negotiations.\u201d\n\nIts operations include the tour groups Thomas Cook GmbH, Thomas Cook Touristik GmbH and Bucher Reisen & \u00d6ger Tours GmbH and others.", "description": "Frankfurt-based airline Condor offered bridging loan after collapse of parent company", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d56ba4e78b7600421148ce6ecfcaf7706ca8560d/56_0_4939_2963/master/4939.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7e66d4d904b836773169c2b8fad201f4", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
