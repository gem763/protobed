That's then topped off with a dollop of whipped cream, dark cocoa powder, and an extra red berry sauce.\n\nThose looking for a hot beverage at their Halloween masquerade party can turn to the Halloween Masquerade Raspberry Mocha, a fruity white mocha beverage that mixes sweet and sour mixed berries with a shot of espresso.\n\nBoth masquerade-themed berry beverages will go on sale at Starbucks stores throughout Japan from Oct 11-31.\n\nRead more stories from grape Japan\n\n-- See Exciting Samurai Film \u201cHatamoto Taikutsu Otoko,\u201d Splendid Kimonos Worn by Lead\n\n-- Dive Into Breast Cushions And More At Japan\u2019s Oppai Art Exhibit\n\n-- Ruby Chocolate Otabe: A New Collaboration From a Long-Standing Kyoto Sweets Shop\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://grapee.jp/en/\n\n\u00a9 grape Japan", "description": "You can pretty much set your calendar to Starbucks Japan gearing up for each month with a new seasonal Frappuccino, with the recent run of \"Peach on the Beach\" and Golden Sweet Potato, and blooming sakura flavors giving each of Japan's distinct seasons a colorful beverage.
