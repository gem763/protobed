Photo: Courtesy of the Retailer\n\nLabor Day, to us, is always bittersweet. Bitter because it reminds us of all the things we wished we\u2019d done in the months leading up to it, like skinny-dipping or eating dinner on a boat. But sweet because it means fall\u2019s milder, jacket-appropriate weather is just around the corner \u2014 and it marks the start of some great sales to stock up on new fall clothes and other essentials. One such great sale is happening now through September 1 at REI, which is offering up to 50 percent off select bags, gear, and apparel for women, men, and kids during its annual Labor Day sale.
