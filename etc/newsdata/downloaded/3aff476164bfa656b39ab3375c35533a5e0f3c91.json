She says the deal will add a relatively high-margin software business to IBM\u2019s stable of offerings at a time when the company\u2019s big clients are shunning its hardware and storing their data on cloud services provided by rivals, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ).\n\n\u201cThis company has had to be reinvented many times,\u201d Rometty said in an interview on Bloomberg Television last month. \u201cIt\u2019s something many other companies have yet to face. It is one thing to put out new products, but it is something else when the competitive landscape attacks your core business models and you have to develop a new one.\u201d\n\nWork In Progress\n\nBut when you dig a little deeper, that turnaround still remains very much a work-in-progress. In the period that ended on June 30, IBM\u2019s sales fell for the fourth straight quarter. Revenue in the company\u2019s IT services division declined by 6.7% year-over-year in the second quarter, while the sales from the unit that houses IBM\u2019s mainframe business fell almost 20%.\n\nWhen the company reports its third-quarter tomorrow, Rometty needs to prove that investor optimism about its revival is justified and that it\u2019s well on track to consistently beat expectations.\n\nIBM price chart\n\nIf Big Blue is successful in showing that its turnaround is gaining momentum, this year's powerful rally\u2014which put the company's shares among the best performing blue-chip stocks on the \u2014is likely to extend.\n\nShares of this legacy tech giant, which dominated computing's early decades with inventions such as the mainframe and later the floppy disk, were trading at $142.04 at Monday's close \u2014 up about 25% this year.\n\nWith this upsurge in the stock, investors are keen to see Red Hat significantly improving the company\u2019s sales and the bottom-line. About 85% of all enterprises are expected to adopt a hybrid cloud approach, in which most will use a mix of public cloud services like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services alongside their own private cloud networks, according to a forecast from Jefferies & Co.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn the short- to medium- run, IBM will continue to be impacted by the structural headwinds that are hurting its sales and profitability. But for long-term investors, whose aim is a steady income stream, owning IBM stock makes a lot of sense.\n\nDespite the recent rally, its stock still yields 4.6% \u2014 more than double the \u2032s 1.85% average \u2014 with an annual payout of $6.48. The company has increased its dividend five times in the past five years. We believe the upside potential remains strong, if the company is able to show that its Red Hat acquisition has begun to pay off.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Microsoft Corporation, Amazon.com Inc.
