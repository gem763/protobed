What we have here today are 11 of the most significant medical colleges in the country, doctors of every type across Australia saying that their prescription is medevac works,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe stand with the doctors in noting that medevac is ensuring that people who are sick are able to get the medical treatment that they need.\u201d\n\nAccording to the parliamentary library, only the home affairs department supported repealing the medevac provisions out of a total of 84 individuals and groups who made submissions to a parliamentary inquiry.\n\nThe Coalition needs the vote of independent senator Jacqui Lambie to repeal medevac provisions, although no vote is expected until after the inquiry reports on 18 October.", "description": "Shadow home affairs minister says window of opportunity closing after Turkish invasion of Kurdish areas led to warnings of breakouts at Isis camps", "authors": ["Paul Karp"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ad94cac25a9b235cc4b8197c15614f294902519/0_249_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4e81cd8967f7eb714ba97c13a6cdebcc", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
