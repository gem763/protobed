It also prevents the glucose from getting to the body\u2019s cells, where it is used for energy.\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed picture across Europe, where 8.8% of adults have the disease, compared with 13% in North America and the Caribbean and 3.3% in Africa.\n\nA slim majority of the 35 countries in Europe that we looked at have seen diabetes prevalence get worse since 2010.\n\nLithuania and Estonia have seen the biggest falls, while Iceland and Turkey have seen the largest hikes, according to data from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).\n\nGlobally the number of people living with diabetes has increased by 10 million since 2015, say IDF.\n\nThe vast majority of those affected have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and lack of exercise, and the epidemic is spreading particularly fast in poorer countries as people adopt Western diets and urban lifestyles.\n\nThe total number of diabetics is now 451 million and is expected to reach 693 million by 2045 if current trends continue.\n\nThe high price of dealing with the disease reflects not only the cost of medicines but also the management of a range of complications, such as limb amputations and eye problems.", "description": "More than one-in-12 adults suffer from diabetes in some EU countries.", "authors": ["Chris Harris"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/404123/1000x563_404123.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-14"}
