(Photo: Marc Teyssier)\n\nIn many ways, our phones and smartwatches have become extensions of the human body, allowing us to conquer more ground than we previously could.\n\nWe outsource our thinking to Siri, Alexa and Google. Our Fitbits tell us what's happening beneath the surface, and we house some of our most precious memories within 128-gigabytes of internal storage.\n\nBut what if these devices began to feel more human? Like, what if the outside of the tech you carry around with you felt less like a slick piece of glass or cold chunk of metal and more like, well, human skin?\n\nThat's exactly what Marc Teyssier and a team of researchers in Paris set to uncover as they developed a \"new paradigm\" where tech has a covering that is \"inspired by the properties of human skin.\"\n\nCheck your bank account!

The coating looks a lot like the real thing, too, and it's been programmed to better respond to human gestures, such as pinching, poking and tickling.\n\nWhen applied, the silicon-based layer could be used on your laptop's touchpad, the band of your smartwatch and the back of your smartphone to make technology feel more personal and approachable.\n\nSkin-On Interfaces are sensitive skin-like input methods than can be added to smartphones, smartwatches and laptops to increase their capabilities.

However the objects of mediated communication \u2013 such as the smartphone \u2013 still has a cold interface that doesn't allow natural interaction and input,\" Teyssier said on the project's website.\n\nTwo versions of the artificial skins were created. The \"Simple\" version looks very plastic, however, the \"Ultrarealistic\" version appears to have pores and ridges like natural skin, according to a video the developers posted on YouTube.\n\nAccording to Gizmodo, the project will soon be presented at a technology research conference in New Orleans. Teyssier told the publication he sought \u201cto propose a possible future with anthropomorphic devices.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of human skin-like smartphone cases?
