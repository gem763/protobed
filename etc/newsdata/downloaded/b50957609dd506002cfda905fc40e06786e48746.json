Its governance differs from bitcoin, which does not have an entity in charge.\n\nThe software will be \"open source,\" meaning companies outside the association can build applications on top of it.\n\nThe association plans to move toward a permissionless blockchain within five years of Libra's launch.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASSOCIATION\n\nThe Libra Association is a 21-member independent non-profit based in Geneva, Switzerland. It will oversee major decisions about the digital coin.\n\nMembers include Uber Technologies Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, as well as venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive Capital.\n\nHowever, the group suffered a serious setback in October, when several high-profile financial companies, including Mastercard, Visa and PayPal abandoned the effort.\n\nThere is a minimum $10 million investment to join, except for non-profit members like financial inclusion group Kiva. The association aims to have 100 members by launch.\n\nEach will have one vote on important issues. Facebook will be a member via Calibra, a newly created subsidiary that will offer a digital wallet for Libra.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE WALLET\n\nIndividuals and merchants will be able to use Calibra to store, send and receive Libras.\n\nIt will be available as a standalone app on smartphones, as well as a button within Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp products.\n\nFacebook eventually wants to make Calibra available for transactions across its family of apps, such as digital checkouts for purchases on Instagram.\n\nThe company appears to be betting it can squeeze revenue out of its messaging services through transactions and payments, something that is already happening on Chinese social apps like WeChat.\n\nExecutives envision users purchasing Libra through the app either by linking a bank account or, for people without banks, at physical locations like cash transfer businesses and convenience stores.\n\nCalibra engineers are involved in building the blockchain, though Facebook says it intends to keep the currency and the wallet in separate entities.\n\nCalibra has about 100 employees, mostly based at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, as well as in Tel Aviv. Calibra executive Kevin Weil told Reuters he did not foresee a dramatic expansion beyond that headcount.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY\n\nEvery person who uses Calibra will have to go through a \"know your customer\" process, which verifies user identities to prevent financial crimes.\n\nThat means anyone who signs up must share a government ID and other personal information.\n\nCalibra will provide support to customers who lose phones or passwords and refund customers whose Libras are stolen by fraudsters, Facebook said.\n\nCalibra will only share user data with parent company Facebook and third parties when it has customer consent, or in other \"limited cases,\" such as when law enforcement requests information, according to a statement.\n\nFacebook pledged not to use Calibra data to improve ad targeting.\n\nBusinesses will see the same information about customers who pay with Libra as they do about customers who pay with credit cards, Weil told Reuters.\n\nStory continues", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook Inc revealed lofty plans to establish a cryptocurrency called Libra in June, but the project quickly ran into trouble with skeptical regulators around the world.
