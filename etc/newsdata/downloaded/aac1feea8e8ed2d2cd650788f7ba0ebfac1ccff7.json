Voice assistants like those made by Google, Amazon and Apple have come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, as it has been revealed that real people regularly listen in on the private conversations people have around their devices.\n\nAmid that scandal, Google had paused its Voice and Audio Activity (VAA) programme. Now it says that it will re-start, but with a series of new changes that are designed to make it more private.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

And it will store less of the information that it collects, as well as giving the option to make smart devices less sensitive and so stop them being triggered by accident so easily.\n\nIn recent months, every other major virtual assistant alongside Google - including Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa as well as Microsoft and Facebook - have come under scrutiny after admitting recordings of user voice interactions with their software were in some cases stored and analysed by human reviewers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We won't include your audio in the human review process unless you've re-confirmed your VAA setting as 'on'.\n\n\"One of the principles we strive toward is minimising the amount of data we store, and we're applying this to the Google Assistant as well.\n\n\"We're also updating our policy to vastly reduce the amount of audio data we store. For those of you who have opted into VAA, we will soon automatically delete the vast majority of audio data associated with your account that's older than a few months. This new policy will be coming to VAA later this year.\"\n\nMr Tasca added that the firm was \"committed to being transparent\" and said Google only listened to a small amount of audio - around 0.2% of all audio snippets.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association", "description": "Google will let users choose to stop it listening to their conversations and store less data about them when it does, it has said.", "authors": ["Andrew Griffin"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/11/google-calendar-hack-security.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
