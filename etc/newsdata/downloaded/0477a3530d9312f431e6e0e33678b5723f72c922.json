You can now purchase the Symfonisk table lamp speaker ($179) or Symfonisk bookshelf speaker ($99) from your local Ikea or from the home furnishing store\u2019s website; these devices aren\u2019t available from third-party retailers like Best Buy or even directly from Sonos. They look Ikea on the outside, but both are very much Sonos speakers on the inside and seamlessly integrate with other products in the company\u2019s lineup like the Sonos One, Beam, Play:5, Play:1, and more.\n\nThe goal of the Symfonisk series is to put speakers in places (such as the bedroom) where you might not ordinarily want something that screams gadget. If you\u2019ve got a partner who prefers to keep tech \u2014 even speakers \u2014 out of there, they might be more amenable to the idea of an Ikea-designed lamp that also happens to pull double duty as a great-sounding speaker.\n\nAs for the bookshelf speaker, well, it very much resembles a speaker. But right out of the gate, it becomes the most inexpensive Sonos speaker you can get. That\u2019s a big deal in its own right. Does the newfound tag-team of Ikea and Sonos meet its potential? They\u2019re off to a good start, with two debut products that are easily worth the money if they appeal to your design sense.\n\nThey also fully integrate with Ikea\u2019s Tradfri smart home platform and Home Smart app. When Ikea\u2019s smart blinds finally ship in October, you\u2019ll be able to set up automated scenes that include the Symfonisk speakers. So in the morning, you can have the blinds go up, lights turn on, and music start playing automatically.\n\nThe Symfonisk table lamp speaker\n\nIt\u2019s a lamp with a Play:1 inside. That\u2019s really the best way of summarizing the Sonos / Ikea table lamp speaker. The internal components aren\u2019t an exact match for the Play:1 or Sonos One, but those are the speakers that Sonos modeled the lamp\u2019s audio performance after, and you can definitely hear it. The Symfonisk lamp will be available in both white and black, but the latter is delayed a bit and won\u2019t be ready at launch.\n\nOur review of Ikea Symfonisk table lamp speaker Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Good sound for the size\n\nBlends in with home decor\n\nAirPlay 2 support Bad Stuff Bulbs are only powerful enough for accent lighting\n\nDesign won\u2019t be for everyone\n\nNo microphone or built-in Alexa or Google Assistant Buy for $179.00 from Ikea\n\nSeeing as there\u2019s fabric around the entire thing, you might think that the lamp speaker outputs 360-degree sound a la Apple\u2019s HomePod. Not so! Its drivers are front-firing, and Ikea and Sonos have tried to make sure you position it correctly by putting the music controls front and center. And when the power cord is plugged in, it runs out underneath the back of the lamp. If you place it in the wrong orientation, it\u2019ll be pretty apparent.\n\nI find the trio of physical buttons to be more foolproof than Sonos\u2019 flat, touch-sensitive control areas on its own speakers. Neither of the Symfonisk products has a built-in microphone, so you\u2019ll need a Google Home or Amazon Echo if you want to start a playlist with your voice hands-free. Thankfully, it\u2019s easy to set an alarm in the Sonos app if you want the lamp to wake you up. Both speakers do include Apple\u2019s AirPlay 2, so if you use an iPhone or iPad, you can play music using Siri and have even more options for music sources beyond the many services that Sonos already supports. Since the lamp will likely find its way to many bedrooms, the white LED indicator light above the play button can be disabled in the Sonos app if you find it distracting at night.\n\nOn the right side of the lamp\u2019s body is an on / off knob for controlling the light bulb. There\u2019s no bulb in the box \u2014 this is an Ikea product, remember \u2014 so you\u2019ll need an E12 bulb (7W max) to shine a light on things. Ikea would obviously prefer that you use its own smart bulbs with the lamp speaker, but Philips Hue also makes bulbs that fit this socket, and dumb bulbs work perfectly fine, too. If you\u2019ve got standard household bulbs, you can try using an adapter, but I didn\u2019t have time to test whether an adapter and bulb would fit underneath the bulbous, opaque glass lampshade. (The shade locks into place and never rattles or makes noise even when you crank up the volume.) Regardless, don\u2019t expect the Symfonisk table lamp speaker to illuminate an entire room. It\u2019s more geared toward accent lighting, but it also makes for a nice reading or bedside lamp.\n\nAs I said earlier, the table lamp speaker sounds fairly close to a Sonos One or Play:1, though it\u2019s not a direct match. For the best sound quality, you should use Sonos\u2019 TruePlay feature, which will tune and calibrate the speaker for optimal performance by taking a room\u2019s ambient characteristics into account. Pacing around with your phone as a speaker emits loud noises still feels a little strange, but the end result is worth any awkwardness. The table lamp can definitely fill a living room or bedroom with sound, and it\u2019s capable of getting plenty loud.\n\nYou set up either Symfonisk speaker using the Sonos app, and the process is a snap (especially if you\u2019ve already got other Sonos devices). It also brings me immense joy that the Sonos app made a suggestion \u2014 with no reason to think I\u2019d purchased a duo of Symfonisk lamps \u2014 that I should pair two of them as the rear surround speakers for my Sonos Beam soundbar. Lamps as surround speakers. What a world.\n\nThe Symfonisk bookshelf speaker\n\nThe bookshelf speaker, also available in white or black, is styled in a way where it\u2019s also clearly meant to blend in with a room and not call much attention to itself. You can lay it flat or stand it up; rubberized feet and the audio controls make it obvious which way is right side up. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no aux input on the bookshelf speaker. I can forgive that with a lamp, but it would\u2019ve been nice here.\n\nIkea designed the bookshelf speaker so that it could be mounted to a wall and actually serve as a small shelf. You\u2019ve got to be sensible in terms of what you put on top of it, as it\u2019s only certified to hold 6.6 pounds of weight. A few books and you\u2019re done. If you mount the speaker near your bed, Ikea also sells a placemat that will prevent your phone from vibrating off of the top.\n\nOur review of Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speaker Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Most affordable way into Sonos ecosystem\n\nCan be mounted as a shelf\n\nSatisfactory sound for the size\n\nGood option for Sonos surround sound Bad Stuff No built-in mic for voice assistants\n\nYou\u2019ll want two for the best audio experience\n\nNo 3.5mm aux input Buy for $99.00 from Ikea\n\nBy itself, and owing to its size, the bookshelf speaker isn\u2019t going to blow your socks off. Sonos tells me that the lamp and bookshelf speakers each have two class-D digital amplifiers, one tweeter, and one mid-woofer inside. But the difference in form factor gives the lamp a definite leg up in bass and overall sound quality.\n\nPutting two of them together as a stereo pair can really open up the sound on the bookshelf speakers, though. You\u2019ll have to spend $200 to get there, but that\u2019s still less than some Sonos speakers and the same price as a single Sonos One. And like the table lamp, they can be set up as rear speakers for a Sonos Beam, Playbar, or Playbase. These would look a little more appropriate in that role than a lamp. The usual Sonos stereo pair rules apply: you can only link two of the same product, not mix and match.\n\nBut the biggest upside to the bookshelf is its $99 price. This is a product that could very well introduce a generation of college students to Sonos and the convenience of wireless, multiroom audio. At the price, I think you\u2019re getting satisfactory sound. The challenge here is finding a direct comparison for the bookshelf speaker. A $100 Bluetooth speaker? The standard Amazon Echo? I think it out-performs both of those options.\n\nThe Ikea and Sonos collaboration is only just beginning with these two products. The companies tell me that they\u2019re already at work on what\u2019s next. I\u2019d sure love a wireless charger as part of the lamp speaker, and hopefully, future models will be able to provide more light than the current one.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why this joint effort makes so much sense: Ikea\u2019s expertise is in creating furniture and other things that belong in the home, but it\u2019s got no clue about sound. Sonos, meanwhile, continues to best even tech\u2019s giants in that category, but it needed help reaching more places and new rooms. Now, its technology is trickling down into a product that\u2019s under $100.\n\nWe still don\u2019t have a Sonos speaker for everything: both of these require a hard wire for power, so we\u2019re left without a wireless option for the patio or backyard \u2014 assuming your Wi-Fi can reach there. And while the bookshelf speaker will be safe in a bathroom, it\u2019s not fully water-resistant. But between the Ikea effort and a renewed push into custom home audio, Sonos is already reaching places that Amazon, Apple, and Google simply aren\u2019t. And it\u2019s doing so at every price level.\n\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge", "description": "The new table lamp and bookshelf speakers from Ikea and Sonos are an impressive start to the collaboration between both companies.
