REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French tyre maker Michelin (MICP.PA) cut its full-year market forecasts again on Thursday, pointing out a sharper-than-expected downturn in the truck segment, but the company maintained its full-year guidance.\n\nThe group, which said two weeks ago it would close a French plant in response to deteriorating conditions of the auto industry, also posted a 8.9% increase in third-quarter revenue to 6.115 billion euros (\u00a35.28 billion).\n\nMichelin said in a statement that the truck tire markets are now expected to end the year down 4%, versus a previous forecast of a 2% decline.\n\nThe group confirmed it expects a segment operating income exceeding the 2018 figure at constant exchange rates and before the estimated 150 million euros contribution from the Fenner and Camso businesses. It also expects a structural free cash flow of more than 1.45 billion euros.", "description": "French tyre maker Michelin cut its full-year market forecasts again on Thursday, pointing out a sharper-than-expected downturn in the truck segment, but the company maintained its full-year guidance.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444553425&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1JH", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
