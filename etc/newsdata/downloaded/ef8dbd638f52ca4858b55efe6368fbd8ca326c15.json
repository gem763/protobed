Liam and his blonde ladyfriend were tootling around New York when they were snapped. The images are over on TMZ if you fancy a butchers.\n\nWe first heard that Miley and Liam had called time on their relationship back in August.\n\nA source at E! reported that \"they were drifting apart\" and have been \"trying to make it work for months\". The insider claimed it had not happened that recently, adding, \"Miley and Liam have still been communicating and it wasn't a messy split but they have decided they are at different points in their lives currently.\"\n\nSoon after these rumours started doing the rounds, a source for Miley confirmed that she and Liam had indeed split. She released a statement (via People).\n\n\"Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time. Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best while they both focus on themselves and careers. They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart. Please respect their process and privacy.\"\n\nAfter briefly dating Kaitlynn, Miley has now moved on with Cody, and they seem to be having a swell time. Lovely stuff.\n\nLike this article?
