Yes, every man and his dog may be prematurely putting a crown on your heads, but you have to embrace that.\n\nRelish the pedestal you\u2019re being put on. Liverpool lacked that mentality yesterday. They did not turn up at Old Trafford looking like a team that had won their last 17 Premier League games. They didn\u2019t swagger in there like champions in waiting.\n\nAs soon as the half-time whistle went, Jurgen Klopp sprinted down the touchline and disappeared into the tunnel. He wanted to get to his players as quickly as possible and bring the team back together.\n\nManchester United frustrated Trent Alexander-Arnold and Co during their league draw\n\nJurgen Klopp will be disappointed but should take heart from fighting back for a point\n\nAll this was partly Liverpool\u2019s own doing, but we also have to credit Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s Manchester United. Their tactics confused and surprised the visitors.\n\nSolskjaer used three at the back and, especially in the first half, his wing-backs played high and did not drop as much as Liverpool would have expected.\n\nUnited\u2019s set-up meant they could apply good pressure on the ball all over the pitch, before they made it more of a stop-start match in the second half.\n\nLiverpool should relish the pedestal they have been put on as Premier League leaders\n\nIt took Liverpool a while to sort themselves out but Klopp used his substitutes well and they got something out of this game. That at least suggests they can become champions.\n\nEarlier on, they did not look like arriving as top dogs brought them any enjoyment, and that has to change.", "description": "MARTIN KEOWN: Liverpool need to learn to enjoy the situation they are in.
