It is a problem which began during Liverpool\u2019s victory over Sheffield United at the end of September, and although he recovered in time to play against Manchester United recently he was still in discomfort.\n\nManager Jurgen Klopp was forced to recall Dejan Lovren against Genk in the Champions League and for last Sunday\u2019s 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLovren will have the chance to re-establish himself alongside Virgil Van Dijk for upcoming games, while Joe Gomez will also be eager to revive his form and challenge for the vacant spot alongside Virgil Van Dijk\n\nGomez is expected to start against Arsenal in Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup tie. Liverpool then face Aston Villa and the return fixture with Genk, before City come to Anfield in a game which - given the current six-point lead in the Premier League table - has the potential to be one of the most significant games of the season.", "description": "Liverpool defender Joel Matip is unlikely to return from injury before the next international break, meaning he is set to miss the crucial Premier League meeting with Manchester City next month.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "Jim White", "Jason Burt", "Luke Edwards", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000213622667-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkzRVrpaG8pgYx8zuruU0oLxVMM-N2Dh3uu4C0ivbnMw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
