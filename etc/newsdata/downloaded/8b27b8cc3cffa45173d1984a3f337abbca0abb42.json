Lydia Tenaglia and Christopher Collins, Bourdain\u2019s longtime producing partners on his acclaimed TV series \u201cParts Unknown\u201d and \u201cNo Reservations,\u201d will be consulting producers for the film. Kimberly Witherspoon, Bourdain\u2019s longtime agent and literary executor, will also be a consulting producer. The Bourdain estate is cooperating with the production.\n\nMore from Variety\n\n\u201cAnthony Bourdain did more to help us understand each other than just about anyone in the history of television,\u201d Neville said. \u201cHe connected with people not in spite of his flaws, but because of them. To have the opportunity to tell his story is humbling. CNN is in the DNA of Tony\u2019s work, and the perfect partners in this journey.\u201d\n\nNeville recently worked with Focus Features on the 2018 docu \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor,\u201d the much-praised look at the life of Fred Rogers, host of the PBS mainstay \u201cMr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood.\u201d Neville will produced the Bourdain doc through his Tremolo Productions banner. Neville earned the feature documentary Oscar for 2013\u2019s \u201cTwenty Feet From Stardom,\u201d a study of backup singers.\n\n\u201cMorgan is the top of the game when it comes to documentary filmmaking and we\u2019re delighted to be working with him again on this project with our great collaborators at CNN Films and HBO Max,\u201d said Focus Features chairman Peter Kujawski.\n\nBourdain shocked his worldwide legion of fans in June 2018 when the news broke that he committed suicide at the age of 61 by hanging while visiting France. Bourdain first made a splash in 2000 with the publication of \u201cKitchen Confidential,\u201d a memoir that helped fuel the rise of chefs and other culinary figures as boldface names in pop culture and in business.\n\nBourdain got his start in TV on Food Network, and then hosted the foodie travelogue series \u201cNo Reservations\u201d for Travel Channel from 2005-2012. He moved to CNN in 2013 with \u201cParts Unknown,\u201d which won six Emmys for best informational series.\n\n\u201cHaving worked with Anthony Bourdain for close to 20 years, Chris Collins and I felt very protective over the story of his life and the decision on who to direct it. In Morgan Neville\u2019s hands, we are sure to get a nuanced portrait of the complex, wildly creative man we knew,\u201d Tenaglia said.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
