Read on to see what it was like to be on board this first test flight.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nI've just spent a day in the air.\n\nNo, not just a day traveling, heading to airports, dealing with buses and terminals, and making connections. But nearly a full day in a pressured metal tube alternating between roughly 34,000 and 42,000 feet above the Earth \u2014 most of that above the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Australian airline Qantas ran a test flight for its \"Project Sunrise\" initiative \u2014 a program to launch regular commercial service from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London.\n\nThe flights, at about 9,900 and 10,500 nautical miles, respectively, represent the farthest \u2014 and currently the longest, in terms of time \u2014 nonstop flights today. While a nonstop flight from London to Sydney has been achieved once, 30 years ago, it hardly counts \u2014 it was flown with a completely empty 747 that had no seats, and it barely had enough fuel to make it. The New York-Sydney route has never been done without a stop in Los Angeles.\n\nWhen it landed, the flight, designated QF7879, became the longest commercial flight in the world, surpassing Singapore Airlines' regular commercial service between Singapore and New York, although next month's test of the London-Sydney flight will surpass this one.\n\nAirplanes and airlines are more technically advanced now than ever before, with better fuel-efficiency, longer ranges, and computer-aided logistical planning. But as some flights get longer, the question is whether passengers and flight crews can tolerate more hours in the air without a layover to break things up.\n\nQantas used this flight \u2013 and plans to do the same for the London route \u2013 to conduct research into how pilots, cabin crews, and passengers cope with the long flight time. In particular, data gathered from monitoring of the pilots and flight attendants will be used to help Qantas make a case to Australian aviation regulators that it's safe to have crew work in shifts for potentially 20 hours or more.\n\nThe airline also tested a redesigned cabin service, meant to help passengers minimize the effects of jetlag as they cross 15 time zones, and reduce the magnitude with which an ultra-long-haul flight can exacerbate those symptoms. Cabin lighting, meal services, and food options were tailored to help passengers and crew either feel more awake, or be more attuned to nighttime.\n\nThis flight also doubled as a delivery of a new Boeing 787-9, from Boeing's Seattle plant. There were only 40 passengers and 10 crew, including four on-duty pilots. Passengers included several Qantas frequent flyers participating in the research study, off-duty Qantas employees, researchers, and media, including this reporter.\n\nThe flight with a full load of passengers and cargo is not currently possible \u2013 the heavier load would reduce the plane's fuel range.\n\nTwo planes in development from Airbus and Boeing would be capable of flying these routes. Qantas has said that it will decide by the end of 2019 which one it will use and that it expects to start commercial service as early as 2023, Alan Joyce, Qantas' CEO, said. The airline had previously hoped to launch service by 2022.\n\nDue to the low passenger load, each person was allocated a business-class seat that could convert into a bed. Passengers were also encouraged to spend some time in the coach cabin in order to balance the plane.\n\nAlthough the flight would obviously be a different experience in coach with a full plane, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce discussed several options to make an ultra-long-haul flight in coach more comfortable.\n\nRegardless, the nearly 20-hour trek in business class, with the redesigned cabin service, was a notably different experience compared to other long-haul flights I've flown in premium cabins, including first and business class.\n\nAside from that, it was truly a unique experience. After all, it's not every flight that you see an airline CEO doing calisthenics in his pajamas.\n\nWhile it is Business Insider's policy not to accept free travel, we were not able to pay for the New York-to-Sydney trip because it was classified as a \"ferry flight,\" for which US Department of Transportation regulations prevent the airline from accepting any money for fares. Business Insider did pay for the return flight with the airline.\n\nFrom takeoff to landing, plus before and after, read on to see what the 19-hour and 16-minute flight was like.", "description": "In all, the nonstop test flight between New York and Sydney took 19 hours and 16 minutes.
