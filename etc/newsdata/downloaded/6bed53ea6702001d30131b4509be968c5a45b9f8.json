(AP) - A fifth horse has died at Santa Anita this fall, the 35th overall fatality since Dec. 26 at the Southern California racetrack.\n\nG Q Covergirl injured both her front legs Friday on the training track. The 5-year-old mare was euthanized on the advice of the attending veterinarian.\n\nTrained by two-time Kentucky Derby winner Doug O\u2019Neill, G Q Covergirl had six wins in 16 career starts and earnings of $200,730. She had won her last two starts and finished in the money in all of her six races this year. O\u2019Neill also owned the mare in a partnership.\n\nThe training track has caused the fewest number of breakdowns. However, there have been three deaths on it since the fall meet began on Sept. 27, including one that was believed to be a heart attack. The other two fatalities occurred during races.\n\nSanta Anita hosts the Breeders\u2019 Cup world championships next weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A fifth horse has died at Santa Anita this fall, the 35th overall fatality since Dec. 26 at the Southern California racetrack.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/25/santa_anita_fatalities_horse_racing_85974_c14-0-3046-1769_s1200x700.jpg?0f825a316581694313403109887b4a3366e67cb9", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
