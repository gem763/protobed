I told them I was going to kill somebody; they said they\u2019d get more money if I did\u2026\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how things are now\u2026but it was definitely a moment I wanted to run away from. It did not feel like it would end anywhere well.\u2019\n\nThe actress feared how it would end (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nKeira has previously opened up on her experience of fame at a young age, and once admitted the ages of 19 to 23 are a \u2018big blur\u2019 for her.\n\nIn an interview with Balance magazine back in January, Keira explained how she struggles to remember that time \u2018in a linear way\u2019 and she began blocking memories out as a coping mechanism.\n\n\u2018My world crashed when I was 22. Everything stopped working and I felt as if I was broken into tiny pieces; as if my brain was literally shattered,\u2019 the actress said.\n\nIn 2008, Keira was nominated for the best actress Bafta for her role in Atonement but she hadn\u2019t left the house in three months when it came to attending the awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There was no way I was going to be able to get on the red carpet without having a f***ing panic attack. So I had hypnotherapy and it worked. Thankfully, I haven\u2019t had that feeling for a long time,\u2019 she said.\n\nLife looks a lot different now for Keira, who is married to James Righton and a mother of two children, daughter Edie, four, and a second child whom she welcomed in September.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
