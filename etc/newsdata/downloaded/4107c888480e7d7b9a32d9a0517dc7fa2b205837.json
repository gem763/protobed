Many remained closed after a weekend that saw scores of stores looted or burned.\n\nOnly one of the city's six subway lines was operating because rioters had burned or damaged many of the stations, and officials said it could take weeks or months to fully restore service.\n\nSome two million students were forced to stay home from classes and many people were unable to reach jobs.\n\nA demonstrator waves a Chilean flag next to a fire as clashing with riot police during a protest on Monday in Santiago.

I urge the Govt to work with all sectors to find solutions to address grievances and bring calm. I urge all planning to take part in protests to do so peacefully: <a href=\"https://t.co/XmDZUnAEK4\">https://t.co/XmDZUnAEK4</a> \u2014@mbachelet\n\n\"The authorities must act in strict accordance with international human rights standards, and any application of the state of emergency must be exceptional and rooted in law,\" Bachelet said.\n\nUp to 13 people have possibly died, with 44 injured, nine of them seriously, and 283 detained, Bachelet said, citing figures from the National Human Rights Institution. Dozens of members of the security force had also been reported as injured, she said.\n\nThe Interior Ministry had put the number of detainees in custody at 1,906, she added.\n\nA riot police water cannon sprays water towards demonstrators taking part in a protest against Chile's state economic model in Santiago. (Ivan Alvarado/Reuters)\n\n'Government cares more about the wealthy'\n\nThe protests have shaken and surprised a nation noted for economic stability over the past decades, which has seen steadily declining poverty despite persistent high rates of inequality.\n\nThey were triggered by a relatively minor increase in subway fares of less than four per cent, but analysts said they were fed by frustration over a long-building sense that many Chileans were not sharing in the nation's advances.\n\n\"I'm protesting for my daughter, for my wife, for my mother, not just for the 30 pesos of the Metro \u2014 for the low salaries, for the privileges of the political class, for their millionaire salaries,\" said Andres Abregu, an Uber driver who complained he's still paying a student debt and can't provide a decent life for his family.\n\nPatricio Navia, a professor at the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University, said \"people went out to protest because they feel the government cares more about the wealthy and that social programs help the very poor, but the rest of the population is left to care for themselves.\n\n\"They are not poor enough to get government subsidies nor rich enough to get government tax credits. They revolted to make their voice heard.\"", "description": "Protesters defied an emergency decree and confronted police in Chile's capital Monday, continuing violent clashes, arson and looting that have left at least 12 dead and led the president to say the country is \"at war.\"", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5330166.1571743470!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1177498553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
