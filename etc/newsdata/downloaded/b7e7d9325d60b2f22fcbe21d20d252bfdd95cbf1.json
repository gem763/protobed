Heck, the left and media want to overturn the entire presidency", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cA National Nightmare Is Upon Us!\u201d Those are the words straight out of the mouth of NBC Political Director Chuck Todd.\n\nIn the eyes of journalists like Todd, \u201cthe basic rules of our democracy are under attack from the president.\u201d Were that true (and it\u2019s not), the only reason the press might be angry would be jealousy. They don\u2019t like it when people play on their turf.\n\nThe news media have been undermining the basic rules of our democracy since before President Trump won the election. They started the war against Trump, not the reverse. The press promoted Trump to split the GOP and get Hillary Clinton elected. They turned on him only when they realized he might win.\n\nIt\u2019s been war ever since. The so-called neutral press are the ones driving impeachment. They have begged the left to remove Trump since the election. Now they have amped up their comments to dangerously unhinged.\n\nARNON MISHKIN: TO SURVIVE IMPEACHMENT THREAT, TRUMP NEEDS TO KEEP BASE FAITHFUL AND ECONOMY STRONG\n\nI\u2019m talking about you, MSNBC.\n\nIn two separate incidents, the network said Trump was calling for violence. Washington Post reporter Eugene Scott told viewers the president was \u201cencouraging those who feel victimized and disrespected to rise up and act out and push back, even if violently.\u201d Lefty historian Jeffrey Engel followed up with talk of the Tiananmen Square massacre and warned Trump\u2019s words \u201cmight start drawing heavily armed people to the National Mall to protect their president.\u201d\n\nHe even concocted \u201ca scenario where President Trump simply refuses to accept the will of the Senate or of the electorate in 2020.\u201d In fact, the only people not accepting election results are liberals \u2014 from Hillary Clinton on down.\n\n\u201cMorning Joe\u201d was almost as bad. Host Joe Scarborough pretended Trump was making \u201ccalls for civil war.\u201d He declared the president\u2019s actions were \u201cgetting dangerous and out of control.\u201d\n\nThey are loving the impeachment inquiry so much that they are laughing about it.\n\nHere are a couple more media examples:\n\nEthics Public Policy Center Senior Fellow Peter Wehner slammed Trump as a \u201csociopath\u201d whose \u201cpathologies\u201d and \u201cillegal conduct\u201d have gotten worse. MSNBC Anchor Stephanie Ruhle doubled down on the assessment and grouped Trump in with \u201csociopaths.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s blind hate.\n\nAnd not just at MSNBC. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman tweeted, \u201cStarting to look like two possible outcomes: Trump and a number of others end up in jail, or thousands of journalists end up in prison camps.\u201d\n\nTimes journalists are particularly upset at Trump using the term \u201ctreason.\u201d This after most of the press pretended Trump was a Russian agent for close to three years.\n\nTrump has a bigger reason to hate the press than any president in history, so where are these prison camps? I mean, if Trump were 1/1,000th the monster the press pretend, he\u2019d have at least locked up some CNN staffers. But the biggest thing haters can point to is him kicking a few loud mouths out of the press room. Oh, and he doesn\u2019t go to the lame White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner.\n\nFascist!\n\nTimes journalists are particularly upset at Trump using the term \u201ctreason.\u201d This after most of the press pretended Trump was a Russian agent for close to three years. Heck, they outright accuse him of treason, but it\u2019s OK when they do it.\n\nBut the phony Russia investigation was nothing in comparison to the impeachment inquiry. The Russian probe only targeted Trump. Now Democrats and their media allies are going for the whole megillah. They want to overturn the entire election. That means Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General William Barr and, of course, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nAnd some of them are betting they can, too.\n\nA Schiff-ty Fact Check\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., is a key figure in the impeachment fiasco. As part of that, he denied speaking to the Ukraine whistleblower.\n\nThat claim was so false that even the Washington Post called him out. The Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler gave the claim four Pinocchios and termed Schiff\u2019s claim as \u201cflat-out false.\u201d\n\nIt likely won\u2019t get a lot of media attention, but it\u2019s still fun to watch the Post occasionally act like a real newspaper.\n\nAnother Fake Hate Crime\n\nJournalists love to report on hate crimes \u2014 even when they are entirely bogus. They get extra credit if they can tie them in some bizarre way to the Trump administration.\n\nThis latest incident threw mud at Second Lady Karen Pence, who teaches at a Virginia Christian school. A 12-year-old African-American girl claimed that three white male students held her down and cut her hair.\n\nIt never happened. But before that dose of reality came out, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC spent nearly 10 minutes targeting the school as racist. This follows media coverage attacking the same school as homophobic a while back.\n\nLike so many media hyped hate crimes, this one turned out to be false, but still did horrific damage. How many million people heard the school was in the wrong and missed the tiny bit of time outlets spent correcting the record, if they did it at all. Because it\u2019s never about news or accuracy any more. It\u2019s just about scoring a hit on Team Trump.\n\nAnd speaking of that...\n\nBloomberg Law Story Really Was That Bad\n\nSometimes a news story is so poorly done that it warrants a follow-up. Bloomberg Law Senior Reporter Ben Penn tried to destroy the career of a Trump Labor Department nominee, falsely claiming the nominee was anti-Semitic.\n\nIt took a whole month but the outlet retracted the story and apologized to readers and appointee Leif Olson. It was long overdue and a prime example why most people never pursue corrections from news outlets.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe original story was horribly headlined: \u201cTrump Labor Aide Quits After Anti-Semitic Facebook Posts Surface.\u201d It was a blatant hit job trying to get Olson for his \u201chistory of advancing controversial conservative and faith-based causes in court.\u201d\n\nNot only was Olson innocent of the charges. He was actually making fun of anti-Semites. The story was such blatant garbage that it was bashed across the political spectrum.\n\nWashington Post Media Critic Eric Wemple reported Friday night about the retraction. He cited how the results of a FOIA request from the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute made the reporter look even worse. The documents show that Penn asked specifically \u201cabout whether [Olson] is fit for government service.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nWemple had a nicer take on it than I do. He credited \u201chaste and shoddy journalism\u201d for the story. That\u2019s being generous. Reporters know that it\u2019s open season on anyone tied to the Trump administration. This time one got caught.\n\nSince so many lawyers were involved in Olson\u2019s defense, this might not be the last time we hear about this story. Here\u2019s hoping.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR", "description": "", "authors": ["Dan Gainor", "Dan Gainor Is The Vice President For Techwatch", "Business", "Culture At The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/05/694940094001_6092557058001_6092542501001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
