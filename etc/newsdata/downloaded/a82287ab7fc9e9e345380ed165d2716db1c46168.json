That could create a new Brexit limbo without leaving time for an election before the new January 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nOthers want Mr Johnson to take his simple election message - that parliament is thwarting the result of the 2016 referendum - straight into an election campaign, convinced he can win a majority and then ease Brexit quickly through.\n\nThere's some worry that Mr Johnson may pay a price among pro-Brexit voters for failing to meet his vigorously promoted self-imposed deadline of October 31 for leaving the EU. But others say these punters are sheeting the blame onto the opposition parties.\n\nMr Corbyn's team is similarly divided. The Labour leader is reportedly keen to fight an election. But others want Brexit out of the way first, because Labour and its supporters are divided over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Corbyn's current ambiguous stance on Brexit risks alienating either a blue-collar electorate that supports Brexit, or else driving a significant wedge of its europhile voters into the arms of the Liberal Democrats. Or both.\n\nThe catalyst for making a decision will be an announcement from the European Union confirming the three-month delay to Brexit. This gives enough time for an election, tempting Mr Johnson down that path.\n\nBut it's also permissible to leave before January 31 if the British parliament does back Mr Johnson's deal - so there's still scope to push for a parliamentary resolution to the impasse. The problem is that parliament tends to shirk making a decision unless it has a deadline gun to its head.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is expected to publicly endorse a three-month Brexit delay.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has voiced scepticism about the worth of a delay, but tends to fall in behind Mr Varadkar, though Mr Johnson reportedly hopes he'll play spoiler.\n\nThe EU member states' top diplomats were scheduled to discuss the delay in Brussels on Thursday morning (AEDT).", "description": "Both the British PM and Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn are at a tactical crossroads.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9127%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_137/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7229b6a7babb64539dafdabf50709d431844db9b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
