I say \u201chyper-focus\u201d because there was a lot more to it than that. Long before the conversation came around to the Biden topic, the \"favor\" that Trump asked for was Zelensky\u2019s assistance in Barr\u2019s ongoing investigation of the genesis of the Trump-Russia investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nVirtually all mainstream-media reporting and Democratic commentary on the conversation now fits this pattern. It is noted that Trump, immediately after the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d set-up \u2014 \u201cI would like you to do us a favor though\u201d \u2014 invoked the attorney general, the nation\u2019s top federal law-enforcement official. Studiously omitted is the context of this invocation: a wholly appropriate request by the president, to the head of state of a country in possession of relevant evidence, for cooperation with a legitimate investigation being conducted by our country\u2019s Justice Department.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nInstead, the coverage skips a few hundred words. It cuts directly to Trump\u2019s suggestion that Zelensky look into whether there was any impropriety Biden\u2019s having purportedly \u201cstopped the prosecution\u201d that might have arisen out of a Ukrainian investigation involving his son.\n\nThe strategy here is obvious. Democrats and their note-takers would like the public to believe that Barr\u2019s investigation is an adjunct of the Trump 2020 campaign \u2014 and a grossly improper one at that. The misimpression they seek to create is that Barr is putting the nation\u2019s law-enforcement powers in the service of Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, in the absence of any public interest. The hope is that this will delegitimize not only any information that emerges from Ukraine but the whole of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of intelligence and law-enforcement abuses of power attendant to the 2016 election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDREW MCCARTHY", "description": "Democrats and their note-takers would like the public to believe that Barr\u2019s investigation is an adjunct of the Trump 2020 campaign.", "authors": ["Andrew Mccarthy", "Andrew C.
