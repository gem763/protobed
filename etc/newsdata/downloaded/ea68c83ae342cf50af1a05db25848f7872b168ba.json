But despite all the hospital trips and the anxiety, Smith also keeps her phone off for hours at a time, or allows it to run out of battery, or leaves it on the tour bus overnight. In one passage, she returns to her hotel and makes a point of sitting down to call everyone she knows in one go, to reassure them she is not lying in a ditch. She recalls now, \u201cI thought \u2013 I made it such a big thing in my mind \u2013 'all right, I\u2019m going to go back to the hotel. I\u2019m going to pay for the calls' \u2013 because it costs extra when you use the hotel phone. 'I\u2019m going to call my children, I\u2019m going to call my lawyer.' And nobody was home!\u201d\n\nHer new book has, she thinks, failed on one account: she had hoped to be completely free of responsibility. In writing the biographical Just Kids, she felt a duty \u201cto Robert, to New York City, to chronology, to the people that surrounded us and to our culture\u201d. When she began the 2015 memoir M Train she \u201cjust wanted to write an irresponsible book!\u201d \u2013 but ended up writing about her husband, Fred Smith, who died in 1994. She has had a string of powerful male muses and mentors in her life \u2013 Allen Ginsberg, Sam Shepard, Bruce Springsteen, the list goes on. One day, she thinks, she will write a book with no one else in mind \u2013 but it never quite seems to happen.\n\nShe suggests that being the eldest of four children, she could never quite turn her back on her duties to others. \u201cI just wanted to be free, my whole life; I just wanted to be an artist and not have to \u2026 I didn\u2019t care about whether I had any money or anything like that, I just wanted to evolve. But because I was the oldest, I had to help out financially, get a job when I was 16 [her song Piss Factory was inspired by her time on a production line, boxing up toys]. I\u2019ve been a breadwinner for a lot of my family. So I know how to be really responsible.\u201d\n\nHas she managed to achieve irresponsibility on a day-to-day level?\n\n\u201cI always find a few moments. To me, it\u2019s about not answering to anybody. I really didn\u2019t want a cellphone, and finally I had to get one because my poor son couldn\u2019t stand not being \u2026 My kids worry about me roaming around the world on my own. When I thought about what I\u2019d like to do in life, when I was young, I had one thought that sort of says it all. On one side, I wanted to be a missionary. And on the other side, I wanted to be a beach bum. So there it is.\u201d\n\nWhen she was in second grade, Smith was very late for school in Germantown, Philadelphia because during her journey, which took her through a wooded area, she got into a long conversation with a snapping turtle. She tells me that in the '50s, snapping turtles were commonly used in soup; they were violent (she makes a snapping sound) and could weigh up to 150lbs (68 kilograms).\n\n\u201cI must have talked to that guy for, like, two hours,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe trouble I got into. My mother had to be called in.\u201d The adult community were concerned because they feared vagrants and kidnappers in the area, yet Smith could not account for the two hours of her life in which she had disappeared. \u201cFinally, my father took me for a walk and said, Tricia, you need to discuss what you were doing for all that time,\u201d she says. She told him about the turtle, and no one bothered her again.\n\n\u201cEven now, as an objective adult \u2013 a semi-objective adult \u2013 I still know I talked to the turtle. It was not a one-sided conversation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith\u2019s father was a questioning man. A factory worker at Minneapolis-Honeywell in Philadelphia, which made thermostats, he was an agnostic who read Jung and Aristotle for fun, and enjoyed sparring with priests he met, or anyone who came to the family home trying to spread their religion. Her mother, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, was less keen on interrogating faith as a concept: Smith herself followed the religion until the age of 12 \u2013\u201cwhich is when you start asking questions that can\u2019t be answered\u201d.\n\nHer parents accepted her artistic aspirations and her lack of interest in finding a husband or becoming a school teacher: \u201cThey knew I wasn\u2019t lacking guts.\u201d And while her father came only twice to see her perform, finding the concerts too loud, her mother was a regular, and a huge rock \u2019n\u2019 roll fan.\n\nThe cover of Patti Smith's Horses album was shot by Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nIn 1975, Smith\u2019s debut album Horses appeared, with a black and white photo on the cover, shot by Mapplethorpe, that spoke to a generation of otherness and androgyny like nothing had done before: many people \u2013 among them Viv Albertine of the Slits and Mick Jones of the Clash \u2013 bought it without hearing a note of the music. After that, Beverly Smith answered her daughter\u2019s fan-mail by hand: Smith received many letters from gay teenagers who\u2019d been disowned by their parents. Beverly would invite them to the family home, Smith explains: \u201cThey thought of her as their new mom and they became close to her, independent of me, because she cared.\u201d\n\nOne teenager who received a reply from Smith\u2019s mother was REM\u2019s Michael Stipe, who wrote, aged about 15, and decided to start a band after hearing Horses. He\u2019d later help reactivate Smith\u2019s musical career in the late '90s after the death of her husband; she had retired from the music scene in the late '80s and retreated to Detroit, where her children were born. She did not miss touring, still wrote her notebooks every day, and replicated the self-educating environment in which she\u2019d grown up by studying and reading with her husband in bed at night, instead of watching the television. \u201cI didn\u2019t perform for 16 years and I was myself,\u201d she says.\n\nIn a sense, it was not difficult to put the career on hold because it is not exactly clear what the career is. \u201cI never aspired to have a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band,\u201d Smith tells me. \u201cI\u2019m not any particular style of performer.\u201d Her biggest hit, Because the Night, was written by Bruce Springsteen and came 41 years ago. She hasn\u2019t had a single chart since 1996 \u2013 and that was as a featured artist with REM. And as someone commonly thought to be the first punk artist, she will always stand apart from the punks who came after: \u201cI saw myself always as a bridge to what was coming. I loved those bands but I knew that I was already looked at as a square to them, or a dinosaur. They insulted me, but they had to.\u201d Who did? \u201cAll of them!\u201d\n\nSmith in 2001. Redferns\n\nIn every punk documentary ever made, Smith is the artist credited with showing women they could be rockstars too. But she tells me, \u201cI do not care about the gender thing. I wasn\u2019t interested in trying to break ground for women. To me, we didn\u2019t need to have it break \u2013 you just got up there and did it.\u201d\n\nThere are many prisoners of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll born in the age that brought about Patti Smith. You can spot them by hair that hasn\u2019t changed in four decades. But there are also people, like Smith, whose relationship with that period in history is tetchier (\u201cI can\u2019t go through my whole life over and over with people\u201d) because while their lives have moved on, they are still ideologically wedded to what they believed in at the time.\n\nWhen living with Mapplethorpe, Smith made extra cash by reviewing records for local Manhattan newspapers that no longer exist, and later for Rolling Stone and Cream magazines. She\u2019d receive $US10 for writing a piece, and sell the records she chose not to write about for a dollar each. But she never gave a bad review to anyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the point in writing a bad review,\u201d she says. \u201cI wrote to open people\u2019s eyes to things they didn\u2019t know. Our cultural voice was built in that period. Rolling Stone went across barriers: revolution and politics and economics. It\u2019s where you went to see how our culture was moving. It wasn\u2019t guided by what was popular \u2013 it was guided by what was guiding us. Maybe it will be relevant again. But what is relevant now? The only thing that\u2019s relevant is truth \u2013 and you really have to get a machete to cut through everything to find it.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the tendency to look backwards, Smith says, \u201cI don\u2019t think of it as nostalgia \u2013 I think of it as pain. I still feel pain that Jimi Hendrix died at 27. I still feel pain that [Albert] Camus died at 46. I still feel pain to see how the Trump administration has unravelled all of Obama\u2019s good works. Everything good that he did, especially for the environment, has been destroyed. So it\u2019s not nostalgia, it\u2019s more pride and some pain.\u201d\n\nShe considers herself a \u201cfollower\u201d of Greta Thunberg. \u201cIn 2020, I\u2019m hoping to see millions of people on the streets. I hope it\u2019s like the time of Gandhi.\u201d But of her own generation, she is now more ambivalent. Born just six months after Donald Trump in 1946, she often crossed paths with her fellow New Yorker in the '70s: \u201cHe has always been around, always terrible.\u201d They would find themselves at the same Manhattan events or dinner table from time to time.\n\nSmith performs with Courtney Barnett in Melbourne in 2017. Deborah Pelser\n\n\u201cHe was pitching Trump Towers then. And just seeing him evolve, and everything he touches turns to shit. I never in my wildest dreams imagined this man would be president of the United States \u2013 someone that I thought was reprehensible since I was in my 20s. He is the most horrible example of anything that could have come out of my generation. Born in the same year \u2013 and I have to look at this person, and I think: all our hopes and dreams from childhood, to going through the '60s, everything we went through \u2013 and that\u2019s what came out of our generation. Him.\n\n\u201cI remember in the '70s, I wrote, \u2018I\u2019m an American artist and I have no guilt.\u2019 Now I feel like saying, \u2018I\u2019m an American artist and I feel guilty about everything.\u2019\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s main income (you sense she lives thriftily) comes from touring. The first musician whose performance truly shook her was Johnny Winter, blues player and brother of Edgar \u2013 partially blind, albino, jumping into the audience in New York in the early '70s and engaging them with what she describes as a \u201cwicked and loving\u201d energy. At her own shows, she sees audience members for whom she could be grandmother and feels \u201cboth a unity and a different sense of love\u201d. She wears the same clothes on stage as she would for her Paris walkabout, and the set is minimal, with no video projections or lighting cues: \u201cAll the same as the '70s, except we got older.\u201d\n\nIf Smith is doing a Hendrix cover and spies a child in the audience upset by the volume, she either brings the child on stage \u201cor I\u2019ll stop the f---ing song and have them leave \u2013 it\u2019s not right\u201d.\n\nBut despite this sense of responsibility, she is not \u201cthe earth mother every minute\u201d. Smith knows there are ways in which she has evolved as a human being, entering her seventh decade, but she liked the younger, harder self too. The travel is wearing these days. \u201cOne has to make priorities,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat do I want to do with the next decade of my life?\u201d\n\nThree days after we speak, she plays the Paris Olympia to an audience of about 3000, giving her \u2013 presumably \u2013 enough time to walk around the city and fill a few more notebooks before she gets on stage.\n\nYear of the Monkey by Patti Smith (Bloomsbury).
