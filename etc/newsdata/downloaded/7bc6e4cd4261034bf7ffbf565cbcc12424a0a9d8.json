The researchers uploaded malicious software to the smart speakers, successfully getting them to obtain recordings.\n\nThere is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited by real-world hackers.\n\n\"Recently a number of articles were published regarding research done by a German cybersecurity company SRLabs in which researchers created apps that passed both Google and Amazon security-vetting processes and allowed the app to eavesdrop on users as well as phish for their passwords,\" Dingell wrote.\n\n\"While these apps were created and used only for research purposes, there is potential for either copycat apps or that malicious actors have already used these techniques to target consumers and their personal information,\" she added.\n\nShe is asking a series of questions, including how Amazon and Google are \"addressing apps like this from being able to obtain\" information moving forward, and how they are getting ahead of hacking attempts.\n\nAmazon and Google did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment.\n\nLawmakers are becoming more invested in cybersecurity and privacy concerns around artificial intelligence technologies like those used within smart speakers.
