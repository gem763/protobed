(The Trump campaign has stiffed the local fire and police departments of at least 10 cities who have hosted his stump speeches to the tune of $840,000, according to the Center for Public Integrity.)\n\nIn public, Mayor Frey played it cool, responding in his own tweet, \u201cYawn\u2026 Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview with The Daily Beast on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, Minneapolis\u2019 second Jewish mayor told The Daily Beast the past 24 hours have brought in a wave of hate from Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve received everything from anti-Semitic rhetoric to threats, and it it\u2019s disconcerting to say the least,\u201d Frey said. His wife, community organizer and lobbyist Sarah Clarke, has not been immune to the ugliness either.\n\nAccording to Frey, \u201cSomeone commented that she was trying to hide her identity because she has a different last name from me. It\u2019s not hiding her identity, that\u2019s championing her own identity. She does exceptional things and [a woman] can support her partner without being synonymous with him.\u201d\n\n\u201c As a mayor, you\u2019re not fully doing your job unless you\u2019re pissing a chunk of people off. \u201d \u2014 Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey\n\nThe 38 year-old professional runner-turned-politician has led the Twin City since 2017. After a gunman killed 11 people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh last year, Frey wrote on Twitter about seeing \u201ca disturbing rise in anti-Semitism rhetoric\u201d since Trump\u2019s election.\n\nBut it will not deter him. Frey still sees his adopted home, where he has spent the last decade, as \u201ca city built on inclusion and diversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the extend that Trump tries to divide us, our community will stand by one another,\u201d Frey said, adding \u201cAs a mayor, you\u2019re not fully doing your job unless you\u2019re pissing a chunk of people off.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not all angry mobs sliding into Frey\u2019s mentions, too. To his delight, many Democrats have supported the mayor not just for his politics, but also his looks.\n\n\u201cPleased to meet you, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey,\u201d blogger Jason Adams tweeted, alongside four photos showing the civil servant very much resembling Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet playing Justin Trudeau in a biopic from 10 years in the future.\n\nIn one image that can only be described as stock \u201cinspirational politician,\u201d the mayor stumps behind a microphone in a suit (sans jacket, sleeves cuffed) as a group of fashionable young people smile and clap.\n\nAnother newly minted Frey fan responded to Trump\u2019s tweets with, \u201cThank you for [bringing] my attention to Jacob Frey so now I know how hot and amazing he is.\u201d Another simply opined: \u201cMayor Jacob Frey is hot, cheekbones for days.\u201d\n\nThe LGBTQ news site Queerty helpfully gathered Frey\u2019s \u201chunkiest\u201d Instagrams, including the mayor taste-testing \u201cclean energy beer,\u201d and celebrating Pride in a tank top and jorts.\n\n\u201cI love the love, and I use it as armor,\u201d Frey said. \u201cI\u2019m an extrovert. I love people. I love people even more when they\u2019re nice to me.\u201d\n\nHis jorts have become somewhat prolific, with Frey wearing them for a photo Men\u2019s Health ran in a profile of the mayor published last month.\n\n\u201cThe infamous jean shorts,\u201d Frey calls them. \u201cI think they\u2019re probably Levi\u2019s, but I\u2019m not sure. I have a couple of different pairs now, and you roll them at a different level for different occasions.\u201d For Men\u2019s Health, they grazed the knee. He let loose at Twin Cities Pride and rolled them up to his mid-thighs.\n\n\u201cI basically have three outfits at this point,\u201d Frey admitted. \u201cShirt and tie, running outfit, and then jean shorts. They might look a bit ratty, but they\u2019re comfortable at this point.\u201d\n\nAnd Frey, who runs about five times a week and enjoys \u201cdifferent body weight exercises like pushups,\u201d can pull them off. He favors tightly tailored suits, like the ones he wore while singing \u201cWinter Wonderland\u201d at a holiday event in 2017.\n\nWhile Frey hasn\u2019t quite hit gay icon status yet, the fact that most of the good-humored thirstiness comes from members of the LGBTQ community is not lost on him. His first political pet project was the Big Gay Race, which began in 2011 and raised money for a group that supported marriage equality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the honor of supporting LGBT people, and I\u2019m honored that they support me back,\u201d Frey said. \u201cIt\u2019s flattering. I love \u2019em.\u201d\n\nFrey\u2019s swooping, matinee idol mane has earned him comparisons to Justin Trudeau, and he\u2019s not mad about it: \u201cTrudeau\u2019s got fabulous hair, so I take that as a big compliment.\u201d But just know one thing: Frey\u2019s is real, damn it.\n\nAs the mayor recalled, \u201cI was on the street a little while ago, and somebody yelled out, \u2018Hey Jacob Frey!\u2019\u201d He turned around, thinking he would greet a supporter.\n\nInstead the man yelled out, \u201cI hate you and your fake Superman curls.\u201d Caught off guard, all the mayor could think of was to yell back, \u201cIt\u2019s not fake!\u201d", "description": "The Minneapolis mayor has had a strange 48 hours. After Trump attacked him on Twitter, he faced a deluge of anti-Semitic messages. Now he\u2019s a sex symbol: \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201d", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570660039/191009-Demopoulos-Jacob-Frey-tease_sdrxkr", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
