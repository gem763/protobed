Sheffield United inflicted a second loss of the campaign on the Gunners and were worthy winners too.\n\nIn an era of fan-owned YouTube channels and sack race betting markets, Premier League managers are under more pressure than ever before. Mass hysteria inevitably awaits any defeat, particularly in games such as Arsenal\u2019s on Monday night.\n\nArsenal fans are starting to turn on Unai Emery following the defeat to Sheffield United on Monday (Picture: Getty)\n\nEmery has teetered on the brink a few times during his Arsenal career but the loss at Bramall Lane seemed to be a watershed moment with more supporters than ever before seemingly boarding the #EmeryOut bandwagon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChief complaints about Emery among Arsenal\u2019s increasingly discontented supporters are in regards to his muddled tactics and surprising team selections, such as regularly fielding three defensive-minded central midfielders and not using his fully-fit \u00a325m left-back.\n\nThe continued omission of Mesut Ozil has also split opinion but with Emery now having a fully-fit squad to choose from \u2013 aside from Reiss Nelson who is out with a knee injury \u2013 what is Arsenal\u2019s best available starting line-up?\n\nTime for Tierney?\n\nA long-term problem area for the Gunners. Arsenal have kept only two clean sheets in the Premier League this season and showcased their age-old vulnerability from set-pieces against Sheffield United in their previous outing.\n\nEmery has stuck with a back-four throughout his second season so far but his decisions over personnel have been increasingly scrutinised. Kieran Tierney, a deadline day signing from Celtic, is yet to feature in the Premier League despite making his Arsenal debut a month ago against Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe Spaniard hinted that Tierney would be involved against Sheffield United, but instead, he went with Sead Kolasinac on the rationale that the Bosnian hasn\u2019t warranted being dropped. Be that as it may, Tierney is the better long-term option at left-back and integrating him sooner rather than later should be high on Emery\u2019s to-do list.\n\nKieran Tierney was an unused substitute at Bramall Lane on Monday night (Picture: Getty)\n\nArsenal\u2019s best right-back has also not been involved in the league yet, with Hector Bellerin being eased back in gently after rupturing his ACL in January. Bellerin did come through 90 minutes against Standard Liege unscathed, though, and unlike Calum Chambers (a centre-back) and Ainsley Maitland-Niles (a midfielder) is a natural right-back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the middle, meanwhile, the clamour for Rob Holding\u2019s inclusion is also growing louder. Holding has played alongside Tierney and Bellerin against Forest and Standard Liege but has also been held back for Premier League matches, being named on the bench for the last three matches.\n\nAlthough David Luiz has shown signs of improvement following a shaky start, Sokratis Papastathopolous has been even less convincing this season than he was during his debut campaign and Holding warrants a run in the side at his expense.\n\nThe Granit Xhaka conundrum\n\nArsenal possess a number of talented midfield players but so far this season, Emery has struggled to strike the right balance. Part of the problem is the continued use of Granit Xhaka who, rather confusingly, is both ill-suited to Emery\u2019s tactical demands and an ever-present fixture in the team.\n\nXhaka\u2019s leadership qualities are reportedly excellent and he clearly holds sway in the dressing room after being voted captain at the start of the season, but he has never fully convinced in Arsenal\u2019s midfield due to his lack of mobility and maddening tendency to gift goals to opposition teams.\n\nGranit Xhaka is Arsenal\u2019s captain but his recent form but he has struggled for form so far this season (Picture: Getty)\n\nAnother of Emery\u2019s favourites is Matteo Guendouzi with the 20-year-old Frenchman clocking up the fourth-highest number of minutes in Arsenal\u2019s squad this season. Unlike Xhaka, Guendouzi has been in excellent form and is fast-becoming Arsenal\u2019s most influential man in the middle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne player who seems to have fallen way down the pecking order is Lucas Torreira, who has faded following an exceptionally bright start to life in north London. The battling Fray Bentos native has been used in an unfamiliar advanced role during his cameo displays thus far, but a deeper position certainly suits him far more.\n\nAlthough Emery has predominantly fielded a 4-3-3 formation this season, Arsenal\u2019s creativity vacuum from central midfield means a switch to a more attacking 4-2-3-1 system must soon be on the cards, with either the out-of-favour Ozil recalled or Dani Ceballos instated in the No.10 position.\n\nLacazette\u2019s timely return to fitness\n\nOne thing that has been painfully obvious at the start of this season is how reliant Arsenal are on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabonese striker has returned a healthy seven goals from his nine Premier League outings, contributing towards 54 per cent of Arsenal\u2019s overall tally.\n\nThat Aubameyang is only just behind Sergio Aguero and Tammy Abraham in the top scorer stakes is remarkable given how starved of service he has been most matches, as was painfully highlighted against Sheffield United when he mustered just one blocked shot in 90 minutes.\n\nEmery needs to discover a way to get the ball to Aubameyang in dangerous areas and the inclusion of either Ozil or Ceballos should help in that regard. So too should the return to fitness of Alexandre Lacazette after his run-out as a substitute against Sheffield United.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette\u2019s return as a substitute was the one bright spot from Arsenal\u2019s defeat to Sheffield United (Picture: Getty)\n\nAlthough Lacazette\u2019s return to fitness means Aubameyang is more likely to be deployed on the left flank as opposed to through the middle, the Frenchman has the ability to fashion chances for his strike partner and create more room for him by occupying opposition centre-backs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicolas Pepe\u2019s form has attracted criticism and a gilt-edged miss against Sheffield United hasn\u2019t done much to dissuade his detractors. The Ivorian\u2019s overall performance at Bramall Lane was actually pretty impressive, though, as he ranked top in Arsenal\u2019s side for dribbles, shots and tackles.\n\nDue to Lacazette\u2019s injury problems, Emery hasn\u2019t been able to field Arsenal\u2019s three-most expensive recruits in tandem too frequently. He will hope that now all three are fit and available, Arsenal\u2019s attacking unit might finally click into gear.\n\nHow Emery should line Arsenal up\n\nMORE: The stats that show Unai Emery is taking Arsenal backwards after dismal Sheffield United defeat", "description": "What is Unai Emery's best Arsenal XI - and why isn't he playing it?
