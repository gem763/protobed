US-China trade deal only \u2018baby step\u2019 as thorny issues remain", "language": "en", "text": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 A partial US-China deal may only offer a temporary tariff reprieve because it lacks specifics and leaves the thorny issues for later, analysts said, allowing both economic powers to claim success.\n\nFriday\u2019s initial agreement \u2014 which included increasing US farm product purchases, and also covers intellectual property, financial services and currencies \u2014 finally breaks an 18-month trade spat.\n\nEngulfed in an impeachment inquiry, US President Donald Trump heralded the deal as a major breakthrough.\n\nBut it will take weeks to finalise and the details are not clear \u2014 nor will it roll back tariffs already in place on hundreds of billions of dollars in two-way trade.\n\n\u201cThe lack of specificity and even the fact this baby stepped agreement could take weeks to iron out, quickly cooled trader optimism,\u201d said Axi Trader analyst Stephen Innes.\n\nAfter earlier attempts at a truce between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping did not pan out businesses remained cautious, Innes said.\n\nThere is \u201cfear this could be more of the same old lather rinse and repeat trade detente followed by trade escalation,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, Washington will hold off on a massive tariff increase planned for next week and \u2014 as negotiations progress \u2014 new December tariffs could also be cancelled, US officials said.\n\nTrump said China had pledged to rapidly increase purchases of American farm products to $40-50 billion \u2014 a stunning feat, and more than double 2017 levels.\n\nBut China is yet to confirm these details.\n\n\u201cSubstantial progress had been made in such areas as agriculture, intellectual property rights protection, exchange rate, financial services, expansion of trade cooperation, technology transfer and dispute settlement,\u201d state-run Xinhua news agency reported citing Liu He, the country\u2019s top negotiator.\n\n\u201cThe two sides also discussed arrangements for future consultations,\u201d Liu said when he met Trump Friday, according to Xinhua.\n\nPreviously, Trump has blamed China for backtracking on its promises.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Major deal unlikely\u2019 \u2013\n\nOn Friday, the US president played up the \u201csubstantial phase one\u201d deal as a result of his hard-line stance with China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not much and it doesn\u2019t get us very far in the big issues, so whether it will lead to anything important is still very unclear,\u201d said Barry Naughton, an expert on China\u2019s economy at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily warned in an editorial Saturday the trade war would only be resolved by \u201cabolishing all tariffs.\u201d\n\nBut to get there, the two sides need to address issues such as scaling back Chinese government subsidies that have skewed competition, and opening up sectors dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\n\nIn a step towards that, China recently announced a timetable to remove foreign ownership limits in finance companies beginning next year.\n\nBeijing also passed a foreign investment law in March, promising a level playing field for overseas investors, addressing a major US complaint.\n\nBut \u201ca significant improvement is\u2026 not very likely,\u201d said Song Houze, a research fellow at The Paulson Institute.\n\n\u201cThe existence of thorny issues like SOE and tech make a major deal unlikely, which means the existing tariff will most likely stay.\u201d\n\nThe latest truce, however, was essential for both sides as both face cooling domestic growth, he said.\n\n\u2013 Off the table \u2013\n\nUS restrictions on Chinese investments in its high-tech sectors \u2014 blocking Huawei from government contracts \u2014 and sanctions on a series of China\u2019s tech giants have also cast a shadow on trade negotiations.\n\nThe US commerce department said last week it will blacklist 28 Chinese entities it says are implicated in rights violations and abuses in China\u2019s Xinjiang region.\n\n\u201cEven if the US and China reach a comprehensive trade deal, the US will likely tighten restrictions on China\u2019s access to technology in the coming years,\u201d said Wang Tao, head of Asia economics at UBS Investment Bank.\n\n\u201cThe US has elevated this issue to national security and it may be hard to reverse, no matter what kind of agreement they reach (or not) on Huawei,\u201d said Wang Tao, head of Asia economics at UBS Investment Bank.", "description": "Beijing (AFP) \u2013 A partial US-China deal may only offer a temporary
