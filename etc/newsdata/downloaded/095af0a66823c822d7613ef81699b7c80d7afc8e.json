(Gail Burton/Associated Press)\n\nA late home run that erases an Orioles lead is nothing new.\n\nAllowing Seattle\u2019s Mallex Smith, one of the fastest men in the game, to reach on an error, steal second and score from there on an infield single to third base?\n\nThat\u2019s the latest in a long line of Orioles losses, 7-6, to the Seattle Mariners before an announced crowd of 22,556, that will go down as one of the most bizarre defeats of the season.\n\nSmith\u2019s late-inning sprints came after a pair of eighth-inning home runs turned the game on itself twice. The Orioles led 4-3 before Mychal Givens allowed a home run to J.P. Crawford to give Seattle a 6-4 lead, only for Baltimore rookie Austin Hays to drill a line drive into the Orioles bullpen to tie the game.\n\nFrom there, neither team threatened much before Smith hit a ball to second baseman Hanser Alberto, who flipped it to reliever Tanner Scott, only for Scott to mishandle it. Smith\u2019s 45th stolen base put him into scoring position, and when pinch-hitter Tim Lopes grounded to third baseman Rio Ruiz, Smith was off.\n\nRuiz\u2019s throw didn\u2019t make it to first in time to get Lopes, and Smith beat Trey Mancini\u2019s throw home for the go-ahead run to drop the Orioles to 50-105 in their penultimate home game of the season.\n\nJonathan Villar was left at third base, representing the tying run, in the 13th inning.\n\nThe foundation of the Orioles\u2019 offensive night was a three-run second inning, which began with a Renato N\u00fa\u00f1ez single.", "description": "The Seattle speedster reached on an error, stole second and scored the key run on an infield single.", "authors": ["Jon Meoli", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jmhh34rq1nzD75hlA8B--sqVjyc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RIKPIFG454I6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
