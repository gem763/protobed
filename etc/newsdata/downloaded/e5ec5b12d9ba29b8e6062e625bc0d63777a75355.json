But Labour counterpart Tom Watson (left) said: 'This whole process has been a shambles'\n\nThe Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport made the announcement in April that from July 15 people wanting to watch online porn in the UK would have to prove their age. But it never came into force\n\n'They've now dropped the pretence and admitted they aren't going to implement it after all.\n\n'This whole process has been a shambles, and the Government must declare how much public money has been spent on this failed policy. The new online harms regulation must not meet the same fate.\n\nHow was porn age verification meant to work? The new law was designed to force Britons wanting to visit porn websites to prove they were old enough to do so. It outlined several ways to do this: In person with a 'porn pass': You would be able to go into a shop and buy a card which will contain a code for an online age-checking system. This would be anonymous but you would have to show some proof of your age to staff to purchase it.\n\nDigital ID apps: These work in a similar way to the code cards but you put your details into them directly, meaning you share proof of age details with them. AgeID, has been set up by MindGeek, which owns several popular adult sites. Another is called 1Account. They work as a plug-in to the sites so you do not have to keep entering your information.\n\nMobile phone settings: The BBFC said people could 'use their mobile phone if the adult filters have been removed'. These methods raised concerns about handing sensitive identification information to third parties. In June computer security expert Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey, called the process 'ineffective' and said the BBFC was 'not equipped' to deal with regulation. He also highlighted the security issues of the policy, as age check firms that users will be required to register with in order to access pornography will hold every users details, making it a 'juicy target' for hackers. A voluntary certification scheme, known as the Age-verification Certificate (AVC), was also due to be available to assess the data security standards of the companies that provide these solutions.\n\n'The Government have a moral duty to protect children, young people and other vulnerable groups at risk of online harms. There isn't time to waste.'\n\nAge restrictions on viewing adult videos and images, the first in the world, were announced by then Digital Minister Margot James in April.\n\nThey were due to come into force on July 15, forcing porn sites to carry out 'robust' age verification checks to be regulated by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).\n\nBut then Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright was forced to apologise in the Commons in June after admitting the proposals would be delayed for the second time, because officials failed to correctly notify the European Union.\n\nThe move, which applied to sites whose content is more than a third pornographic, was designed to cut the number of children who are freely able to access extreme material on the internet.\n\nBut it was criticised by freedom campaigners and others who feared that making people give personal details leaves them open to fraud and blackmail.\n\nUnder the new law companies running porn websites would have had to make users prove they are over 18, or face punishments including being blocked in the UK, being barred from receiving electronic payments or being delisted from search engines.\n\nThis means that punters will have to use one of several ways of proving their age, including picking up a 'porn pas' from the local newsagent.\n\nThe BBFC said in April that 18 'determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography'.\n\nIn a question and answer section on the website set up in response to the new law the BBFC said that it would 'primarily' target adult websites with high volumes of traffic but be partly reliant on whistleblowers to tell it about smaller sites breaking the law.\n\nIt admitted that the new law, part of the Digital Economy Act 2017, is mainly aimed at children who accidentally 'stumble across pornography on commercial pornographic websites'.\n\nTony Stower, head of child safety online and innovation for the NSPCC, said the delay in implementing curbs on porn viewing was disappointing', adding: 'It is also imperative that the vehicle used to achieve protection for children from pornography is robust and effective. The Government cannot drag its feet on this.'\n\nMs Morgan added today: 'The government's commitment to protecting children online is unwavering.\n\n'Adult content is too easily accessed online and more needs to be done to protect children from harm.\n\n'We want to deliver the most comprehensive approach to keeping children safe online and recognised in the Online Harms White Paper the role that technology can play in keeping all users, particularly children, safe.'", "description": "Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan announced that a new law forcing people to prove they are 18 or over to access content would not be going ahead.
