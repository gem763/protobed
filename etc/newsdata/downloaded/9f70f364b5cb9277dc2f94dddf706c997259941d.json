Ask again and you might end up in the gallows,\" he tweeted.\n\nIran has expressed mounting frustration at Europe's failure to offset the effects of renewed US sanctions in return for its continued compliance with the agreement.\n\nBut Britain said Tehran's moves to suspend limits on research and development were \"deeply concerning\".\n\n\"This third step away from its commitments under the nuclear deal is particularly disappointing at a time when we and our European and international partners are working hard to de-escalate tensions with Iran,\" a Foreign Office spokesperson said.\n\nTehran had already hit back twice with countermeasures in response to the US withdrawal from the deal.\n\nOn July 1, Iran said it had increased its stockpile of enriched uranium to beyond the 300-kilogramme limit set by the agreement.\n\nA week later, it announced it had exceeded the deal's uranium enrichment limit of 3.67 percent.\n\nThe UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on August 30 that Iran's uranium stockpile stood at about 360 kilogrammes, of which just over 10 percent was enriched to 4.5 percent.\n\nRouhani has stressed that the countermeasures Iran has adopted are all readily reversible if the remaining parties to the deal honour their undertakings to provide sanctions relief.\n\nThe Iranian president on Wednesday gave Europe a 60-day ultimatum before Iran drops another commitment.\n\nFrancois Nicoullaud, a French former ambassador to Iran, said the moves to be detailed Saturday would likely focus on bringing on line new centrifuges for enriching uranium -- and would be \"only partially reversible\".\n\n\"Even if research is stopped, the intellectual gains are forever,\" he said.\n\nBut analyst Henry Rome argued that the moves appeared to be \"provocative but reversible\".\n\n\"Tehran is building leverage, not a bomb,\" said Rome, a specialist on Iran for the Washington-based Eurasia Group consultancy.\n\nHe added that the French initiative, meant to provide Iran with a multi-billion-dollar line of credit in exchange for returning to deal compliance, is \"likely to wither away\" because it requires Washington's approval.", "description": "Iran is set to detail its latest cut to commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal on Saturday, in response to US sanctions and perceived inaction by other parties to save the accord.
