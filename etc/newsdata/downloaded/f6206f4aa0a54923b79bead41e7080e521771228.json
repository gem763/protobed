We're down 1-0 down here, as they say here in England, and then played an incredible game. We won 7-2 against a team that reached the Champions League final last year.\n\n'We often have the comparisons between Bundesliga and Premier League. And today, at least we at Bayern Munich have proven on a lasting basis that we are perfectly capable of defeating a top-class Premier League team.'\n\nThe German media waxed lyrical about the performance and Gnabry in particular, with BILD referring to him as 'Grenade Gnabry'.\n\nHe netted 13 times in 42 games last season and is determined to show an improvement on his goal return this season.\n\nSporting director Hasan Salihamidzic added: 'Four goals in one half - that's a huge achievement. We have confidence. The boy is developing well.'\n\nBayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge addressed the room at the dinner on Tuesday night\n\nFamily members, board members and the entire playing staff kicked back to celebrate the win\n\nGnabry came alive in the second half as Bayern built on a 2-1 lead to totally take their hosts apart.\n\nHis first goal was a piece of indivudual brilliance. He picked up the ball wide on the left, just inside Tottenham's half before driving forward, skipping over the challenge of Serge Aurier before cutting inside to fire past Hugo Lloris on his right foot.\n\nHis second came minutes later after Harry Winks lost possession to Corentin Tolisso and the Frenchman played it through in Gnabry's path and he picked out the same corner, this time with his left foot.\n\nThe hat-trick came after a pin-point ball over the top from Thiago Alcantara saw him take it down before racing clear, picking out the same corner as the first two. A fourth was added in the final stages to cap off his finest career performance.", "description": "While Serge Gnabry took centre stage against Tottenham on Tuesday night as Bayern ran out 7-2 winners, the German winger wanted to keep a low profile at the celebratory banquet.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/14/19207862-0-image-a-5_1570024715177.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
