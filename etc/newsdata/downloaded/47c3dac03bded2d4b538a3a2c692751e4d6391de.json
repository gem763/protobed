In addition to moving, researchers say it can regenerate after being cut in half after just two minutes\n\nThis newest exhibit of the Paris Zoological Park, which goes on display to the public on Saturday, has no mouth, no stomach, no eyes, but is capable of detecting food and digesting it.\n\n'The blob is a living being which belongs to one of nature's mysteries,' said Bruno David, director of the Paris Museum of Natural History, of which the Zoological Park is part.\n\n'It surprises us because it has no brain but is able to learn (...) and if you merge two blobs, the one that has learned will transmit its knowledge to the other.'\n\nResearchers say the organism, which has been loosely identified as some kind of slime mold, is capable of a learning.\n\nIn an experiment from 2016, researchers found that they could teach the mold to cross a bridge lined with salt - a substance the mold was initially repulsed by.\n\nFurthermore, they found that when they combined a slime mold with another mold that had not been taught to cross the bridge, the learning transferred into the new organism.\n\nThe blob is loosely identified as a kind of slim mold and has been observed as having the capability to learn and transfer behaviors to other 'blobs'\n\nAs a result, scientists say that the blob is likely capable of transferring knowledge through a type of fusion. Initial studies have keyed in on a 'vein' that forms between two specimen after being combined.\n\n'We know for sure it is not a plant but we don't really if it's an animal or a fungus,\" said David.\n\n'It behaves very surprisingly for something that looks like a mushroom (...) it has the behavior of an animal, it is able to learn,' said David.", "description": "This newest exhibit of the Paris Zoological Park, which goes on display to the public on Saturday, has no mouth, no stomach, no eyes, but is capable of detecting food and digesting it.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/22/19809252-0-image-a-12_1571262682403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
