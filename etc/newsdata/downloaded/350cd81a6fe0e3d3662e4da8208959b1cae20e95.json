Journalists and a local politician were also targeted during several rounds of pepper spray and a during one confrontation a live warning shot was reportedly fired in the air.\n\nMultiple arrests were made during the mayhem, with The Telegraph counting at least 30 within the space of a few hours.\n\nAs Beijing\u2019s key anniversary approaches, the Hong Kong police have also increased stop and search operations at subway stations and on public transport, focussing on citizens wearing black, the colour of the protests.\n\nAfter four months of the worst political unrest since Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China in 1997, demonstrators still seem determined to defy Beijing and secure their freedoms.\n\nRiot police advance towards Hong Kong protesters Credit: Vincent Yu/AP More", "description": "Hong Kong police on Sunday toughened their crowd control measures, pushing back forcefully with tear gas and water cannons against pro-democracy protesters as tensions continue to spike ahead of China\u2019s National Day celebrations on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Katy Wong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/g.T5dH53poz8DtJlJea8gw--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/945e1a1dd8e24ac443dfb1eb5cd4ef1f", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
