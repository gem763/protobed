(Niklas Halle'n/Afp Via Getty Images)\n\nUnder gloomy skies, Queen Elizabeth II rode in queenly style in her four-horse state carriage Monday morning from Buckingham Palace to Westminster to open a new term of Parliament, an over-the-top show of pomp and pageantry, and an almost surreal beginning for a make-or-break week for Boris Johnson and Brexit.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Speech is designed to acknowledge the 400 years of tradition in the cradle of parliamentary democracy and the ongoing \u2014 though mostly symbolic \u2014 role of the monarch. It is usually a jolly good show, broadcast live, complete with 41-gun salutes, lots of yeomen in scarlet tunics and lords in robes, and a mock search of Westminster\u2019s cellars for explosives.\n\nAs for the speech itself? The prime minister and his ministers actually write it. The address lays out the government\u2019s agenda \u2014 even while it remains uncertain how long the government of Boris Johnson may last.\n\nWhile the debate over Johnson\u2019s ambitious domestic agenda begins Monday afternoon at Westminster Palace, all eyes in the chamber will be scrolling the screens of their smartphones for news from Brussels, where British and European negotiators are in their third day of secret talks over the fate of Brexit.\n\n[Boris Johnson\u2019s office spins call with Merkel, says Brexit breakthrough \u2018essentially impossible\u2019]\n\nEven before the queen spoke, Labour Party leader Diane Abbot panned Monday\u2019s performance, calling it \u201cfarcical,\u201d just a wish list which the government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.\u201d\n\n\n\nQueen Elizabeth II travels by carriage to the State Opening of Parliament at the Palace of Westminster on Oct. 14, 2019 in London.

The challenge remains what to do about the border on the island of Ireland \u2014 and how to preserve both British sovereignty alongside the E.U.\u2019s demands to protect its single market and customs union.\n\nIn her speech, the queen was expected to announce 22 new bills comprising Johnson\u2019s domestic proposals. The policy announcements will include stiffer penalties for some offenders; an end to \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d for E.U. citizens coming to Britain and efforts to introduce a points-based immigration policy similar to Australia\u2019s; and a new environment bill that will set binding targets on reducing plastic use, cutting air pollution and restoring biodiversity.\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s own attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, has dismissed the House of Commons as a \u201czombie\u201d Parliament paralyzed over Brexit \u2014 it may go on and on, but never dies. It just eats the brains of its captives. A general election looms.\n\nThe opposition parties say the Johnson government doesn\u2019t have the majority it needs to pass any of the measures outlined in the speech.\n\nSince Johnson became prime minister, his working majority has plummeted from one to minus 43. Johnson lost his working majority after 21 Conservative lawmakers \u2014 including Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson \u2014 were kicked out of the party for backing legislation aimed at stopping a no-deal Brexit at the end of the month.\n\nIn the three-year-long melodrama of Brexit, the British press has labeled many weeks \u201cmake-or-break,\u201d with the government facing crunch deadlines.\n\nOn Monday, the Telegraph newspaper called this crunch \u201cthe crunchiest\u201d deadline of all.\n\nThe 28 European leaders will met at the E.U. Council on Thursday and Friday in Brussels. They say this is the last possible opportunity for the heads of the 27 other nations to agree to a Brexit deal \u2014 at least in theory.\n\nOn Saturday, Johnson will face a rare Saturday session of Parliament \u2014 only four times, since Hitler invaded Poland, has the House of Commons sat on a Saturday.\n\nThe lawmakers earlier passed a bill that forbids Johnson from leaving the E.U. without a deal, called the Benn Act, after its sponsor. Johnson has repeatedly called it the \u201cSurrender Act.\u201d The prime minister has vowed to leave \u2014 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2014 on Oct. 31.\n\nBoth things can\u2019t be so. If Britain fails to craft a Brexit deal with the Europeans this week, most observers say he will reluctantly find a way to seek an extension \u2014 most likely in order to stage an election.\n\nIf, however, Johnson makes a deal, then it will be debated in Parliament on Saturday. Would it, could it pass? Nobody knows. Johnson has lost seven consecutive votes in the House of Commons. The opposition parties have already said they would vote against the deal, whatever it is.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Brexit proposals were first rejected last week and a deal was declared dead. Then it was revived when the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he and Johnson could imagine a landing zone for a deal. Then the E.U. and British specialists went into talks.\n\nIn Brussels, the bureaucrats were mostly gloomy about the chances of a deal; the politicians, however, were less so. The European Union is also famous for crafting deals at five minutes to midnight.\n\nThe stumbling block this week \u2014 as it has been for two years \u2014 is what to do about the border on the island of Ireland.\n\nAfter Brexit, Northern Ireland will remain in the United Kingdom, while the Republic of Ireland in the south will remain part of the European Union. How to control the flow of goods \u2014 especially agriculture products \u2014 and how to collect customs tariffs between the two entities is the knot that must be untied.\n\nIn his latest proposals, Johnson has proposed that Northern Ireland would essentially remain in the British customs union, but follow E.U. customs rules.\n\nRead more\n\nE.U. rejects Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit proposal, raising prospect of chaotic break within weeks\n\nWidower of murdered lawmaker and Boris Johnson\u2019s sister join criticism of prime minister\u2019s language in Brexit debate\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson accused of groping a journalist\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The opening of Parliament comes during another make or break week for Boris Johnson and Brexit.", "authors": ["William Booth", "London Bureau Chief", "Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Mx3oXmj1twx_aLJWVDSf9XqyRoY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I2VSI6HON4I6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
