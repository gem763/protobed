Some cast members and characters may have changed \u2013 mainly in the form of legal teams \u2013 but the core remains.\n\nFor the longest time now, Zuma has been fighting tooth and nail to stop his corruption, racketeering and money laundering trial from going ahead.\n\nIn that time, he has piled more spouses into his homestead and added to the number of little humans to be counted in the census.\n\nHe has served two terms as leader of his party and was booted out just before he completed his second as president of the republic.\n\nThen he pitifully whimpers that he is the victim of multiple forces who want to punish him for being the selfless champion of the poor and the bulwark against the impending imperialist invasion.\n\nAs if his spell with the likes of Schabir Shaik and others was not enough, he has helped crooked men and women pilfer tens of billions of rands from the South African public.\n\nFresh criminal charges will most likely arise related to his activities when he was in office, overseeing this widescale looting.\n\nIn the time since this soap opera began, he has overseen the decimation of South African institutions and the values that underpin a constitutional state.\n\nHe has hollowed out the state and turned corruption into an acceptable practice in many quarters.\n\n\n\nIn this time, the economy has been made to look like an emaciated cow during a famine. State-owned enterprises have been brought to their knees in the course of the looting.\n\nDespite all this, he projects the contradictory figure of defiance and victimhood.\n\nHe defiantly tells us he is the son of warriors and that he is an intelligence-trained soldier who will fight and vanquish his foes.\n\nThen he pitifully whimpers that he is the victim of multiple forces who want to punish him for being the selfless champion of the poor and the bulwark against the impending imperialist invasion.\n\nUnlike Days and The Bold, Zuma\u2019s soap opera is losing traction even among his most loyal fans.\n\nYou can see by the dwindling crowds who used to sacrifice their nights to camp out for him.\n\nEven those who came for the free pap and vleis are finding other rent-a-crowd causes to latch on to. It is clear that there is no longer much creativity in the plot.\n\nIt\u2019s the same script pitched slightly differently, and the dialogue has become predictable.\n\nOnly the fibbing Carl Niehaus (there may be a few others) still finds Zuma\u2019s tales interesting, perhaps only because they are as bizarre as his own lies and imaginations.\n\nThe judges of the various divisions and levels of South African courts are becoming irritated by what is now looking like an abuse of the constitutional set-up that Zuma despises and worked to undermine.\n\nRead: Court dismisses Zuma\u2019s application for a permanent stay, with costs\n\nEach time Zuma has tried to spin his sorry tales in the courts, the judges have seen right through the elegantly crafted arguments of his lawyers and told him that he has to stand trial.\n\nNo matter how hard his legal teams tried to repackage the story and even appeal to emotion, the hard facts of the law won.\n\nThis weekend, the man whose counsel made the word \u2018Stalingrad\u2019 part of South Africa\u2019s popular lexicon has to work out whether the strategies that were employed in that famous battle can still work following the unanimous shooting down of his application for a permanent stay of prosecution by the Pietermaritzburg High Court.\n\nThe judges, led by Jerome Mnguni, declared that he had not suffered \u201cprejudice of any kind\u201d as a result of not being charged alongside Shaik, as his counsel had argued, and that this would not mean he wouldn\u2019t get a fair trial.\n\nHe was told that the decisions around the timing of the serving of indictments on him around the time of the 2007 ANC Polokwane conference \u201cdoes not impact on the strength of the state\u2019s case ... and the prosecution of the case\u201d.\n\nHe was told that his contention that his prosecution was wrongful because it was allegedly politically motivated was irrelevant and diversionary, as had already been ruled by the Supreme Court of Appeal in 2016.\n\nZuma had to bear the pain of hearing that Shaun Abrahams, the National Prosecuting Authority head he trusted to protect him, and who had fulfilled his brief for some time, had been correct to reinstate the charges.\n\nZuma should now do the nation a favour and go prove his innocence in court.\n\nWho knows, he may win.", "description": "The former president will head to court as the soapie that is his life drags on, writes Mondli Makhanya.", "authors": ["Mondli Makhanya"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9337/e1dbeba97c75447db9f25cd26a9ddcad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
