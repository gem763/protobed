Hubert Minnis, the prime minister, urged Bahamians to show love to come through the ordeal suffered by their country, while aerial video recorded over the Bahamas' Great Abaco Island showed mile upon mile of flooded neighbourhoods and smashed buildings.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, authorities in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas were on high alert, as they watched for indications the storm may make landfall in their states.\n\nEarly on Tuesday, Dorian was downgraded by a single notch to a category 2 storm, with sustained maximum winds of 125mph. At the same time, the size the hurricane covered increased, as did the speed at which it was moving.\n\n\u201cThe headline for this #Dorian advisory is NOT that the wind speed has slightly decreased,\u201d the National Hurricane Centre said of an update it issued on Twitter. \u201cThe combined wind, surge, and floods hazards are the same or even worse since the hurricane has become larger.\u201d\n\nHaving been essentially stationary over Grand Bahama island for two days, Dorian began moving northwest at 2mph \u2013 less than walking speed \u2013 and was around 105 miles east of Fort Pierce, Florida.\n\nIt was expected to make its way towards the Florida coastline by the end of the day, though it remained unclear if it would make landfall there, despite previous warnings and authorities ordering the evacuation of a a number of vulnerable counties. A total of nine counties issued mandatory evacuation orders, including Duval County, which includes Jacksonville, one of Florida\u2019s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina also ordered evacuations of some coastal counties. Forecasts suggested the storm will move northwards, hugging the coast of Georgia and potentially making landfall in either North or South Carolina by the end of Thursday. Late on Tuesday, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper also announced evacuations for his coastal residents, while recognising the inconvenience. \"When you weigh the cost of losing lives, this is something you need to do,\" he told CNN.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/624246174001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6082822785001\n\nHurricane Dorian pounds relentlessly at Bahamas\n\n\u201cHurricane Dorian has been a very complicated storm, and we appreciate the support of president Donald Trump, Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] and our neighbouring states that have deployed resources,\u201d tweeted Florida\u2019s Republican governor Ron de Santis. \u201cWe will continue to work with all of our partners until the storm threat had passed.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThese impacts, including flooding, structural damage, storm surge and serious beach erosion in our coastal communities cannot be understated.\u201d\n\nAmong those being evacuated was Sue Watson, a 93-year-old resident of a retirement community in Kissimmee in central Florida.", "description": "Millions of Americans have been ordered to evacuate their homes after Hurricane Dorian \u2013 having relentlessly battered the Bahamas for days, leaving at least five fatalities and dozens of injuries in its wake \u2013 picked up speed and size and started bearing down on the southeastern coastline.Officials in", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C36RNWZ8eLhT8EP.U_8RqA--~B/aD0yOTk7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/a4eaae683ecf57770362ed422192ad53"}
