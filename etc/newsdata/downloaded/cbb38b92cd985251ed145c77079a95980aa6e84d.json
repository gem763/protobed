Now women are tweeting their own stories.", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s an oft-repeated story by the Democratic candidate, but critics raised questions about her account. And then came the voices questioning the idea of pregnancy discrimination at all.\n\nMaybe most women aren\u2019t told straight out they didn\u2019t get a job because they\u2019re pregnant or may become pregnant. (Though that still happens, too.) And perhaps women aren\u2019t typically fired because they are showing the signs of pregnancy or recently gave birth (typically). But there\u2019s no shortage of women who are or may become pregnant who have to navigate the quiet discrimination that comes their way. Still. Today.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs illustrated on Twitter yesterday:\n\nIf you have trouble believing that Elizabeth Warren experienced pregnancy discrimination because no one wrote down \"Fired because pregnant,\" you are going to be floored when you learn about the experiences of.... any other human woman you know. \u2014 Alyssa Leader (@alittleleader) October 8, 2019\n\nI was asked by a prospective employer if I was planning to get pregnant. In 2019. At a very reputable organization. P.S: Anyone who tells you pregnancy discrimination in the workplace doesn\u2019t exist is lying. \u2014 Huma Imtiaz (@HumaImtiaz) October 8, 2019\n\nThe fact that in 2019 I know women who are nervous announcing their pregnancies at work or job hunting during pregnancy is how I know that pregnancy discrimination is not ancient history \u2014 Aminatou Sow (@aminatou) October 8, 2019\n\nThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act, an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u201cforbids discrimination based on pregnancy when it comes to any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training, fringe benefits, such as leave and health insurance, and any other term or condition of employment.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, yesterday, after there were questions about the validity of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s statement that she was let go from her teaching job when she was pregnant, there was a wave of skepticism as to the general validity of pregnancy discrimination.\n\nBut as many women know, hiding a pregnancy at work is no joke. And breaking the news to your boss often takes skill and fortitude.\n\nAD\n\nWhy? Well, here:\n\nWhen I told my boss I was pregnant, he said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you plan to take the whole 3 months off.\u201d \u2014 Stephanie Wittels Wachs (@wittelstephanie) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, it still happens, and that\u2019s sort of crazy,\u201d says Tom Spiggle, an employment lawyer in Arlington and author of \u201cYou\u2019re Pregnant? You\u2019re Fired!: Protecting Mothers, Fathers and Other Caregivers in the Workplace.\u201d \u201cWe see fairly blatant pregnancy discrimination from companies that probably know better.\u201d Of course, he said, the corporate world has \u201cmade great strides in acknowledging the needs of parents with children, both men and women. But that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHis firm has had cases where a pregnant woman is offered a job, then comes into the office in person and the offer is rescinded without explanation. Sometimes, in good companies, Spiggle said, a manager \u201cgoes rogue\u201d and denies a woman a promotion or job because she\u2019s pregnant or may be. That manager worries that his team won\u2019t hit certain numbers or goals if she goes on leave. And more often, Spiggle sees women who have always had good reviews, constant raises and promotions \u2014 until they become pregnant. Suddenly, he said, she is not good enough, given poor performance evaluations and put on notice.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome companies just haven\u2019t gotten the memo,\u201d Spiggle says. \u201cThey know they\u2019re not supposed to discriminate on the basis of race \u2026 but they don\u2019t perceive pregnancy or child care as a potential class.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are many companies that not only do as the law says but also know that doing so pays off in the right hire and some good publicity. For instance:\n\nWhen I was pregnant, the NYT offered me a job, and BuzzFeed gave me a very tempting counter to stay. Nobody brought up the fact that I was 8 months pregnant, not once.\n\n\n\nI tell this story often, and loudly. This is how it should be. \u2014 She-Ra Frenkel (@sheeraf) October 8, 2019\n\nSee how that works? Win.
