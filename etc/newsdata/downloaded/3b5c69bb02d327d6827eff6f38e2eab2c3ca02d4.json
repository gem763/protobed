The stories woven into the life story of the Alabama-born country music songstress, though, bear scars that go deeper than most, and memories which never depart. Allison Moorer understands that the only way out of hell is through it, even as a very young child. In her new memoir, \u201cBlood,\u201d the Country Music artist, with ten albums to her credit, and younger sister to Grammy winner, Shelby Lynne, chronicles the love, the fear, the family tragedy, and finally, the journey to forgiveness shared by the siblings. Moorer spoke with Anthony Mason, of \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d for her only televised interview regarding the book, on October 29.\n\nThe brutal but necessary history\n\nAutopsy reports are not something that most daughters would ever look forward to receiving, but Allison Moorer points out the envelopes in her departed father\u2019s briefcase, remembering when she sent the request for the information.\n\n\u201cWhat I'm really trying to do is forgive,\u201d Allison insists, and she knows now that she is ready and able to grant that blessing, and know its freedom.\n\nPart of her mission, through the testament of the pages in \u201cBlood,\u201d is to prove to herself and others that she and her sister weren\u2019t \u201cruined by it all,\u201d relating the ordeal of the murder-suicide that took both their parents, and changed their perspectives on life forever.\n\nPhotos fill the walls of Allison Moorer\u2019s home, reflecting both \u201cterror\u201d and the comfort of nostalgia. Music was embedded from birth into Allison and Shelby Lynne, and so was a prayer that Allison repeated over and over each night,\n\n\u201cGod, please don't let Daddy hurt Mama,\u201d Moorer vividly recites.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

TV Shows\n\nFranklin Moorer seemed to be a doting dad, in portraits but possessed a mean streak and a drinking problem that overtook his virtues. One day, when Allison fell from a horse she was riding with Shelby, the father struck his eldest daughter with a blow to the face, blaming her for the normal childhood accident.\n\nLike millions of other abused sons and daughters, Moorer questions how she's supposed to feel like she's \"worth anything\u201d after beatings that become almost routine from a father.\n\nLynn (Laura Lynn) Moorer left Franklin Moorer with her teenage daughters in 1986 but, on August 12 of that year, the greatest horror imaginable happened. Allison Moorer woke to the gunshots, as her father shot their mother, and then himself. Shelby was standing in the front yard amidst the scene. The beatings stopped, but not the overwhelming hurt.\n\nLove and little boys\n\n\u201cThe tragedy colors everything,\u201d confesses Moorer, making the good moments \u201ca bit bittersweet.\u201d Still, there are gifts that Allison Moorer and her sister take with them.\n\n\u201cShe never, ever let me believe that I was not loved,\u201d assures the singer, who still has the early recordings of mother and daughters singing together. \u201cShe is the reason that I'm okay. She is the reason my sister is okay.\u201d\n\nWalking their road as \u201cnot belonging to anyone in this world\u201d has not been easy for Allison and Shelby Lynne. \u201cWe've always belonged to each other,\u201d Moorer confirms.\n\nBoth artists have achieved more than musical success.\n\nMoorer first signed with MCA Nashville in 1997, and her song, \u201cA Soft Place to Fall,\u201d was featured in Robert Redford's \u201cThe Horse Whisperer.\u201d The song was nominated for an Oscar as Best Song, and Allison Moorer performed the song she co-wrote Gwil Owen on the 1999 Academy Awards broadcast. Moorer is also known for her recording of \u201cPicture\u201d for the radio version with Kid Rock. Many fans feel that Allison outshines the Sheryl Crow rendition. Her album, \u201cNightlight,\u201d released this year, serves as a musical accompaniment to her memoir.\n\nShelby Lynne\u2019s self-titled 1999 debut album earned the artist a Grammy as Best New Artist and she followed up with an ACM award for New Female Vocalist of the Year. Performances have never stopped for Lynne, who founded her own record label, Everso, and recorded the album \u201cTears, Lies, and Alibis\u201d along with two more. The older sister is highly sought after for her contralto voice and has been featured with a myriad of country superstars in addition to her solo success. When the sisters sing together, family harmony is unmistakable.\n\nLife can bring lessons in the most unexpected ways. The birth of Allison Moorer's son, John Henry, brought an overwhelming joy and healing which the songwriter could never have imagined.\n\n\u201cTime, investigation, willingness and having a little boy,\u201d brought Allison to a point of \u201cnothing but love\u201d for her father. Getting to that juncture is difficult to explain, but experiencing her own motherly joys of boyhood somehow helped her to understand that her father, too, was once a little boy, who never sought to be remembered as a murderer.\n\nJohn Henry is autistic and Allison Moorer knows that she will have to explain the story of his grandparents one day. She can only immerse him in love for now and describe that grandma and grandpa were \u201ctroubled and beautiful like we all are.\u201d", "description": "Acclaimed artist has learned the power of forgiveness and shared those lessons in music and a beautifully articulate book.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Milos Kitanovic", "Ramon Sanchez", "Jane Flowers", "Read More On The Same Topic Tresa Patterson", "Hawaii Five-O", "Season", "Halloween Episode", "Horror In A Mother'S Scorn", "Kindness Wins"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/29/os/b_1200x630/allison-moorer-has-moved-from-music-to-the-pages-in-her-story-of-family-tragedy-and-healing-blood-image-source-ctmyoutube_2346693.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
