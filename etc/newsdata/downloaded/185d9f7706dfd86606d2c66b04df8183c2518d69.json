If someone makes an alternative lifestyle look attainable and stands out on socials they can take off massively.\u201d\n\nEliana\u2019s videos are simple and edited on her smartphone, with the 21-year-old showing subscribers around her converted 1995 GMC Vandura van and talking through the practicalities of life on the road, from taking a shower to dealing with break-ins.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eliana and her van.

Chris Stokel-Walker, a journalist and author of YouTubers: How YouTube Shook Up TV and Created a New Generation of Stars, said although her rise has been meteoric, it is a lack of understanding around how the platform works that is fuelling the sceptics.\n\n\u201cThere is a dearth of information about how recommendations work on YouTube, so people assume it\u2019s a manufactured success when it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has that intangible mix of being cool and outdoorsy with a sense of adventure, coupled with an engaging and quirky personality. It\u2019s that Beach Boys aesthetic meets Jack Kerouac but for 2019.\u201d\n\nShe has also tapped into the boom in solo travel. About 15% of British holidaymakers took a trip by themselves in 2018, up from 12% in 2017 and 6% in 2011, a trend reflected in the surge in YouTube content aimed at that market.\n\n\u201cSince 2016, uploads with \u2018solo travel\u2019 in the title have steadily increased year over year with 2019 proving to be the largest year yet,\u201d said a YouTube spokesperson. \u201cThis year, out of the top 100 most viewed videos with \u2018solo travel\u2019 in the title, over 70 were uploaded by women.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jennelle Eliana\u2019s van tour\n\nThe appeal to her Generation Z peers has been attributed to her lo-fi production values and focus on the more unglamorous sides of travel, according to the tech journalist Taylor Lorenz, who has written about Eliana. Her videos also chime with a move toward less manufactured, \u201cauthentic\u201d online content favoured by younger viewers on platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s representative of an entire generation sticking their middle finger up to what women \u2018should\u2019 be doing,\u201d said Eve Young, co-host of the Social Minds podcast. \u201cThe popularity of solo female travel is a real sign of the times: it connotes freedom, choice, financial independence and confidence.\u201d\n\nEliana\u2019s sudden rise fits another emerging trend in the number of black women creating solo travel videos on YouTube. The platform says there are a \u201cnotable number of videos\u201d from black female creators sharing their experiences of travelling among the most viewed in the solo travel category.\n\nThe journalist Georgina Lawton says Eliana\u2019s vlog and others like it fill a blindspot that the travel industry has traditionally had around catering for women of colour.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve consistently been seen as a monolith by the UK travel industry,\u201d said Lawton, , who is writing a guide to solo travel for women of colour. \u201cNow when someone does something like Jennelle Eliana with her vanlife videos, it breaks the mould and it appeals to so many more people who think they can do it.\u201d\n\nLawton says she was inspired by Oneika Raymond, who started out as a vlogger before becoming a host on the Travel Channel. Part of the appeal for her of content made by black solo female travellers such as Oneika is that it helps bust myths about alternative forms of travel.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eliana in a still from one of her videos.

These videos answer those questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to recognise that YouTube is so massive that you can build a niche that people identify with,\u201d said Stokel-Walker. \u201cThe thing is a niche interest on YouTube still means millions of views.\u201d\n\nThe interesting thing for him is what will happen next. He says Eliana and other successful YouTubers will quickly have to choose whether to accept commercial offers or reject them in order to retain their original appeal.\n\n\u201cThey build their audience on authenticity and then they get to a level when they become almost a traditional celebrity,\u201d said Stokel-Walker, who expects brands to start throwing offers at Eliana. \u201cAnd then the original appeal gets a lot harder to maintain.\u201d", "description": "Lo-fi videos about life on the road also fill blindspot travel industry has in catering for women of colour", "authors": ["Lanre Bakare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a418a879bcc0ff139a65ce462c120443a1b3f393/0_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5adaa0fc166e22ca50fbe76df1b965d1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
