They are the second-largest birds in the world \u2013 behind the ostrich.", "description": "Bird apprehended after brief chase on US 99 near Fresno, leaving officers unsure if escapee came from farm or moving vehicle", "authors": ["Associated Press In Fresno"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0923ce67b855170fb949e97dcaa7897540f3fb49/0_109_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=784da91ec8c0aa291575ff84a50d182f", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
