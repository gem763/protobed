[Photo provided to China Daily]\n\n\"De Ja Vu\" is an exhibition at Beijing's Today Art Museum which unfolds the present and the future of an emerging computational world to the audience.\n\nFeatured artists from home and aboard envision circumstances in which a world is ruled by numbers, digits, models, processes and measurements.\n\nAt the exhibition which ends on Thursday, people can navigate the works on show in two directions: A clockwise experience will lead to an end of the human race, with machines becoming the plant's sole residents; while a counter-clockwise tour provides people a perspective to look back on the collective history of humans and machines.\n\nCurated by Long Xingru, the exhibition is third of its kind under a program called Future of Today. Today Art Museum mounted two exhibitions in 2015 and 2017 to discuss how technology will revolutionize the way people and machines interact and the methods of artists in a digital age.", "description": "\"De Ja Vu\" is an exhibition at Beijing's Today Art Museum which unfolds the present and the future of an emerging computational world to the audience.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db143dfa310cf3e97a2c405.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
