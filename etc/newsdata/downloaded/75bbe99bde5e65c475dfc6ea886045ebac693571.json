It\u2019s part of the recent investigation into the anti-Trump network by James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas. While we have known that CNN was biased, we now have evidence from the people who work there that the network is pretty much the mouthpiece for the Democratic Party. We have tales of Jeff Zucker, CNN\u2019s president, giving marching orders to stay on the impeachment story and stormed into a control room ordering them to nix commercials and extend an interview with a top Trump official in the hopes of tripping her up on live television. There is a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d mentality against the Trump White House in this newsroom.\n\nIf liberals wonder why the chant \u201cCNN sucks\u201d remains popular, well, here you go. And now we have sexual harassment allegations. Veritas was able to get oodles of footage from an insider Cary Poarch and other journalists from Veritas. One was able to capture Jake Tapper\u2019s senior producer, Rick Saleeby, detailing an alleged run-in a young female had with CNN Politics Supervising Producer Steve Brusk. In the video, Saleeby alleges that the senior management knows about the antics but is protecting him (via Project Veritas):\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen speaking about CNN Politics Supervising Producer and White House Unit Supervising Producer/Coverage Manager, Steve Brusk, \u2018The Lead with Jake Tapper\u2019 Senior Producer Rick Saleeby said: \u201c\u2026he would like make advances if there was a social gathering and they were drunk\u2026 Put his arms around them, try and touch their leg. Try and build up emails to the level where he would get flirty and inappropriate.\u201d According to Saleeby, there was a social gathering where a twenty-one-year-old woman was getting drunk and Steve Brusk allegedly saw an opportunity to make sexual advances on her. Saleeby says: \u201cSo, like, there is this girl that was twenty-one. She\u2019s actually a good friend of mine. She had just gotten hired after being an intern\u2026And she was getting\u2026There was a going away party for a co-worker. We were all having a really good time\u2026She was very well liked. We were getting drunk. He started like staying close to her\u2026Arm around her.\u201d Saleeby went on to describe the scene with more details: \u201cShe had a skirt on. I could see the hand. I like grab her. It looked like I was being the assaulter because I grabbed her so aggressive\u2026To keep her from him. Like go around her and go Come over here and looked at him because I could flatten him\u2026It was like\u2026I wouldn\u2019t do it because then I would be the one who got fired\u2026He would have absolutely been like \u2018get in a cab with me later.\u2019\u201d Saleeby states that he found out later that there had allegedly been prior accusations against Brusk\n\nOh, and you bet Veritas reached out for comment. Tapper wouldn\u2019t comment and neither would Saleeby, but Brusk said, \u201cI, I, I don\u2019t. Um but uh, I\u2019ll let our PR people talk to you about that\u201d\u2026\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019m happy to put you in touch with our PR people.\u201d\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t unusual or an isolated case. At NBC News, we have Ronan Farrow documenting how the higher-ups there tried to kill his story about the allegations lobbed against former Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein because the higher-ups there reportedly knew that if this got out, Matt Lauer could be put in jeopardy. Eventually, Lauer was fired from the Today Show for sexual misconduct and he\u2019s now facing a rape allegation from the time the network was covering the Olympics in Sochi. The icons of the liberal media are taking a beating.", "description": ".10/23/2019 5:40:47AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/354/63b3af8d-4413-480e-867d-76bb1e91edfa.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
