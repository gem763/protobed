It was a very strange speech. Was it one branch of the intelligence services sending a shot across the bows of another? Or was it pointed at Theresa May\u2019s government? Does she know something she\u2019s not telling us?\u201d\n\nSenior intelligence analyst, April 2017\n\nIn January 2013, a young American postgraduate was passing through London when she was called up by the boss of a firm where she\u2019d previously interned. The company, SCL Elections, went on to be bought by Robert Mercer, a secretive hedge fund billionaire, renamed Cambridge Analytica, and achieved a certain notoriety as the data analytics firm that played a role in both Trump and Brexit campaigns. But all of this was still to come. London in 2013 was still basking in the afterglow of the Olympics. Britain had not yet Brexited. The world had not yet turned.\n\nFollow the data: does a legal document link Brexit campaigns to US billionaire? Read more\n\n\u201cThat was before we became this dark, dystopian data company that gave the world Trump,\u201d a former Cambridge Analytica employee who I\u2019ll call Paul tells me. \u201cIt was back when we were still just a psychological warfare firm.\u201d\n\nWas that really what you called it, I ask him. Psychological warfare? \u201cTotally. That\u2019s what it is. Psyops. Psychological operations \u2013 the same methods the military use to effect mass sentiment change. It\u2019s what they mean by winning \u2018hearts and minds\u2019. We were just doing it to win elections in the kind of developing countries that don\u2019t have many rules.\u201d\n\nWhy would anyone want to intern with a psychological warfare firm, I ask him. And he looks at me like I am mad. \u201cIt was like working for MI6. Only it\u2019s MI6 for hire. It was very posh, very English, run by an old Etonian and you got to do some really cool things. Fly all over the world. You were working with the president of Kenya or Ghana or wherever. It\u2019s not like election campaigns in the west. You got to do all sorts of crazy shit.\u201d\n\nOn that day in January 2013, the intern met up with SCL\u2019s chief executive, Alexander Nix, and gave him the germ of an idea. \u201cShe said, \u2018You really need to get into data.\u2019 She really drummed it home to Alexander. And she mentioned to him a firm that belonged to someone she knew about through her father.\u201d\n\nI had been speaking to former employees of Cambridge Analytica for months and heard dozens of hair-raising stories, but it was still a gobsmacking moment. To anyone concerned about surveillance, Palantir is practically now a trigger word. The data-mining firm has contracts with governments all over the world \u2013 including GCHQ and the NSA. It\u2019s owned by Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and major investor in Facebook, who became Silicon Valley\u2019s first vocal supporter of Trump.\n\n\n\nIn some ways, an intern showing up and referring to Palantir is just another weird detail in the weirdest story I have ever researched.\n\nA weird but telling detail. Because it goes to the heart of why the story of Cambridge Analytica is one of the most profoundly unsettling of our time. What\u2019s clear is that the power and dominance of the Silicon Valley \u2013 Google and Facebook and a small handful of others \u2013 are at the centre of the global tectonic shift we are currently witnessing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The money man: Robert Mercer, Trump supporter and owner of Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: Rex\n\nIt also reveals a critical and gaping hole in the political debate in Britain. Because what is happening in America and what is happening in Britain are entwined. Brexit and Trump are entwined. The Trump administration\u2019s links to Russia and Britain are entwined. And Cambridge Analytica is one point of focus through which we can see all these relationships in play; it also reveals the elephant in the room as we hurtle into a general election: Britain tying its future to an America that is being remade - in a radical and alarming way - by Trump.\n\nThere are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.\n\nMy entry point into this story began, as so many things do, with a late-night Google. Last December, I took an unsettling tumble into a wormhole of Google autocomplete suggestions that ended with \u201cdid the holocaust happen\u201d. And an entire page of results that claimed it didn\u2019t.\n\nGoogle\u2019s algorithm had been gamed by extremist sites and it was Jonathan Albright, a professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, who helped me get to grips with what I was seeing. He was the first person to map and uncover an entire \u201calt-right\u201d news and information ecosystem and he was the one who first introduced me to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nHe called the company a central point in the right\u2019s \u201cpropaganda machine\u201d, a line I quoted in reference to its work for the Trump election campaign and the referendum Leave campaign. That led to the second article featuring Cambridge Analytica \u2013 as a central node in the alternative news and information network that I believed Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon, the key Trump aide who is now his chief strategist, were creating. I found evidence suggesting they were on a strategic mission to smash the mainstream media and replace it with one comprising alternative facts, fake history and rightwing propaganda.\n\nMercer is a brilliant computer scientist, a pioneer in early artificial intelligence, and the co-owner of one of the most successful hedge funds on the planet (with a gravity-defying 71.8% annual return). And, he is also, I discovered, good friends with Nigel Farage. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU\u2019s communications director, told me that it was Mercer who had directed his company, Cambridge Analytica, to \u201chelp\u201d the Leave campaign.\n\nThe second article triggered two investigations, which are both continuing: one by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office into the possible illegal use of data. And a second by the Electoral Commission which is \u201cfocused on whether one or more donations \u2013 including services \u2013 accepted by Leave.EU was \u2018impermissable\u2019\u201d.\n\nWhat I then discovered is that Mercer\u2019s role in the referendum went far beyond this. Far beyond the jurisdiction of any UK law. The key to understanding how a motivated and determined billionaire could bypass ourelectoral laws rests on AggregateIQ, an obscure web analytics company based in an office above a shop in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nIt was with AggregateIQ that Vote Leave (the official Leave campaign) chose to spend \u00a33.9m, more than half its official \u00a37m campaign budget. As did three other affiliated Leave campaigns: BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and the Democratic Unionist party, spending a further \u00a3757,750. \u201cCoordination\u201d between campaigns is prohibited under UK electoral law, unless campaign expenditure is declared, jointly. It wasn\u2019t. Vote Leave says the Electoral Commission \u201clooked into this\u201d and gave it \u201ca clean bill of health\u201d.\n\nHow did an obscure Canadian company come to play such a pivotal role in Brexit? It\u2019s a question that Martin Moore, director of the centre for the study of communication, media and power at King\u2019s College London has been asking too. \u201cI went through all the Leave campaign invoices when the Electoral Commission uploaded them to its site in February. And I kept on discovering all these huge amounts going to a company that not only had I never heard of, but that there was practically nothing at all about on the internet. More money was spent with AggregateIQ than with any other company in any other campaign in the entire referendum. All I found, at that time, was a one-page website and that was it. It was an absolute mystery.\u201d\n\nMoore contributed to an LSE report published in April that concluded UK\u2019s electoral laws were \u201cweak and helpless\u201d in the face of new forms of digital campaigning. Offshore companies, money poured into databases, unfettered third parties\u2026 the caps on spending had come off. The laws that had always underpinned Britain\u2019s electoral laws were no longer fit for purpose. Laws, the report said, that needed \u201curgently reviewing by parliament\u201d.\n\nAggregateIQ holds the key to unravelling another complicated network of influence that Mercer has created. A source emailed me to say he had found that AggregateIQ\u2019s address and telephone number corresponded to a company listed on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s website as its overseas office: \u201cSCL Canada\u201d. A day later, that online reference vanished.\n\nThere had to be a connection between the two companies. Between the various Leave campaigns. Between the referendum and Mercer. It was too big a coincidence. But everyone \u2013 AggregateIQ, Cambridge Analytica, Leave.EU, Vote Leave \u2013 denied it. AggregateIQ had just been a short-term \u201ccontractor\u201d to Cambridge Analytica. There was nothing to disprove this. We published the known facts. On 29 March, article 50 was triggered.\n\nThen I meet Paul, the first of two sources formerly employed by Cambridge Analytica. He is in his late 20s and bears mental scars from his time there. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like post-traumatic shock. It was so\u2026 messed up. It happened so fast. I just woke up one morning and found we\u2019d turned into the Republican fascist party. I still can\u2019t get my head around it.\u201d\n\nHe laughed when I told him the frustrating mystery that was AggregateIQ. \u201cFind Chris Wylie,\u201d he said.\n\nWho\u2019s Chris Wylie?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica. And he\u2019s from west Canada. It\u2019s only because of him that AggregateIQ exist. They\u2019re his friends. He\u2019s the one who brought them in.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t just a relationship between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, Paul told me. They were intimately entwined, key nodes in Robert Mercer\u2019s distributed empire. \u201cThe Canadians were our back office. They built our software for us. They held our database. If AggregateIQ is involved then Cambridge Analytica is involved. And if Cambridge Analytica is involved, then Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon are involved. You need to find Chris Wylie.\u201d\n\nMark Zuckerberg says change the world, yet he sets the rules | Carole Cadwalladr Read more\n\nI did find Chris Wylie. He refused to comment.\n\nKey to understanding how data would transform the company is knowing where it came from. And it\u2019s a letter from \u201cDirector of Defence Operations, SCL Group\u201d, that helped me realise this. It\u2019s from \u201cCommander Steve Tatham, PhD, MPhil, Royal Navy (rtd)\u201d complaining about my use in my Mercer article of the word \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nI wrote back to him pointing out references in papers he\u2019d written to \u201cdeception\u201d and \u201cpropaganda\u201d, which I said I understood to be \u201croughly synonymous with \u2018disinformation\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s only later that it strikes me how strange it is that I\u2019m corresponding with a retired navy commander about military strategies that may have been used in British and US elections.\n\nWhat\u2019s been lost in the US coverage of this \u201cdata analytics\u201d firm is the understanding of where the firm came from: deep within the military-industrial complex. A weird British corner of it populated, as the military establishment in Britain is, by old-school Tories. Geoffrey Pattie, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for defence procurement and director of Marconi Defence Systems, used to be on the board, and Lord Marland, David Cameron\u2019s pro-Brexit former trade envoy, a shareholder.\n\nSteve Tatham was the head of psychological operations for British forces in Afghanistan. The Observer has seen letters endorsing him from the UK Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and Nato.\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica was not some startup created by a couple of guys with a Mac PowerBook. It\u2019s effectively part of the British defence establishment. And, now, too, the American defence establishment. An ex-commanding officer of the US Marine Corps operations centre, Chris Naler, has recently joined Iota Global, a partner of the SCL group.\n\nThis is not just a story about social psychology and data analytics. It has to be understood in terms of a military contractor using military strategies on a civilian population. Us. David Miller, a professor of sociology at Bath University and an authority in psyops and propaganda, says it is \u201can extraordinary scandal that this should be anywhere near a democracy. It should be clear to voters where information is coming from, and if it\u2019s not transparent or open where it\u2019s coming from, it raises the question of whether we are actually living in a democracy or not.\u201d\n\nPaul and David, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, were working at the firm when it introduced mass data-harvesting to its psychological warfare techniques. \u201cIt brought psychology, propaganda and technology together in this powerful new way,\u201d David tells me.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Bannon, former vice-president of Cambridge Analytica, now a key adviser to Donald Trump. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nAnd it was Facebook that made it possible. It was from Facebook that Cambridge Analytica obtained its vast dataset in the first place. Earlier, psychologists at Cambridge University harvested Facebook data (legally) for research purposes and published pioneering peer-reviewed work about determining personality traits, political partisanship, sexuality and much more from people\u2019s Facebook \u201clikes\u201d. And SCL/Cambridge Analytica contracted a scientist at the university, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, to harvest new Facebook data. And he did so by paying people to take a personality quiz which also allowed not just their own Facebook profiles to be harvested, but also those of their friends \u2013 a process then allowed by the social network.\n\nFacebook was the source of the psychological insights that enabled Cambridge Analytica to target individuals. It was also the mechanism that enabled them to be delivered on a large scale.\n\nThe company also (perfectly legally) bought consumer datasets \u2013 on everything from magazine subscriptions to airline travel \u2013 and uniquely it appended these with the psych data to voter files. It matched all this information to people\u2019s addresses, their phone numbers and often their email addresses. \u201cThe goal is to capture every single aspect of every voter\u2019s information environment,\u201d said David. \u201cAnd the personality data enabled Cambridge Analytica to craft individual messages.\u201d\n\nFinding \u201cpersuadable\u201d voters is key for any campaign and with its treasure trove of data, Cambridge Analytica could target people high in neuroticism, for example, with images of immigrants \u201cswamping\u201d the country. The key is finding emotional triggers for each individual voter.\n\nCambridge Analytica worked on campaigns in several key states for a Republican political action committee. Its key objective, according to a memo the Observer has seen, was \u201cvoter disengagement\u201d and \u201cto persuade Democrat voters to stay at home\u201d: a profoundly disquieting tactic. It has previously been claimed that suppression tactics were used in the campaign, but this document provides the first actual evidence.\n\nBut does it actually work? One of the criticisms that has been levelled at my and others\u2019 articles is that Cambridge Analytica\u2019s \u201cspecial sauce\u201d has been oversold. Is what it is doing any different from any other political consultancy?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a political consultancy,\u201d says David. \u201cYou have to understand this is not a normal company in any way. I don\u2019t think Mercer even cares if it ever makes any money. It\u2019s the product of a billionaire spending huge amounts of money to build his own experimental science lab, to test what works, to find tiny slivers of influence that can tip an election. Robert Mercer did not invest in this firm until it ran a bunch of pilots \u2013 controlled trials. This is one of the smartest computer scientists in the world. He is not going to splash $15m on bullshit.\u201d\n\nTamsin Shaw, an associate professor of philosophy at New York University, helps me understand the context. She has researched the US military\u2019s funding and use of psychological research for use in torture. \u201cThe capacity for this science to be used to manipulate emotions is very well established. This is military-funded technology that has been harnessed by a global plutocracy and is being used to sway elections in ways that people can\u2019t even see, don\u2019t even realise is happening to them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about exploiting existing phenomenon like nationalism and then using it to manipulate people at the margins. To have so much data in the hands of a bunch of international plutocrats to do with it what they will is absolutely chilling.\n\n\u201cWe are in an information war and billionaires are buying up these companies, which are then employed to go to work in the heart of government. That\u2019s a very worrying situation.\u201d\n\nGoogle is not \u2018just\u2019 a platform. It frames, shapes and distorts how we see the world Read more\n\nA project that Cambridge Analytica carried out in Trinidad in 2013 brings all the elements in this story together. Just as Robert Mercer began his negotiations with SCL boss Alexander Nix about an acquisition, SCL was retained by several government ministers in Trinidad and Tobago. The brief involved developing a micro-targeting programme for the governing party of the time. And AggregateIQ \u2013 the same company involved in delivering Brexit for Vote Leave \u2013 was brought in to build the targeting platform.\n\nDavid said: \u201cThe standard SCL/CA method is that you get a government contract from the ruling party. And this pays for the political work. So, it\u2019s often some bullshit health project that\u2019s just a cover for getting the minister re-elected. But in this case, our government contacts were with Trinidad\u2019s national security council.\u201d\n\nThe security work was to be the prize for the political work. Documents seen by the Observer show that this was a proposal to capture citizens\u2019 browsing history en masse, recording phone conversations and applying natural language processing to the recorded voice data to construct a national police database, complete with scores for each citizen on their propensity to commit crime.\n\n\u201cThe plan put to the minister was Minority Report. It was pre-crime. And the fact that Cambridge Analytica is now working inside the Pentagon is, I think, absolutely terrifying,\u201d said David.\n\nThese documents throw light on a significant and under-reported aspect of the Trump administration. The company that helped Trump achieve power in the first place has now been awarded contracts in the Pentagon and the US state department. Its former vice-president Steve Bannon now sits in the White House. It is also reported to be in discussions for \u201cmilitary and homeland security work\u201d.\n\nIn the US, the government is bound by strict laws about what data it can collect on individuals. But, for private companies anything goes. Is it unreasonable to see in this the possible beginnings of an authoritarian surveillance state?\n\nA state that is bringing corporate interests into the heart of the administration. Documents detail Cambridge Analytica is involved with many other right-leaning billionaires, including Rupert Murdoch. One memo references Cambridge Analytica trying to place an article with a journalist in Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal: \u201cRM re-channeled and connected with Jamie McCauley from Robert Thomson News Corp office,\u201d it says.\n\nIt makes me think again about the story involving the intern, Cambridge Analytica and Palantir. Is it a telling detail, or is it a clue to something else going on? Cambridge Analytica and Palantir both declined to comment for this article on whether they had any relationship. But witnesses and emails confirm that meetings between Cambridge Analytica and Palantir took place in 2013. The possibility of a working relationship was at least discussed.\n\nFurther documents seen by the Observer confirm that at least one senior Palantir employee consulted with Cambridge Analytica in relation to the Trinidad project and later political work in the US. But at the time, I\u2019m told, Palantir decided it was too much of a reputational risk for a more formal arrangement. There was no upside to it. Palantir is a company that is trusted to handle vast datasets on UK and US citizens for GCHQ and the NSA, as well as many other countries.\n\nNow though, they are both owned by ideologically aligned billionaires: Robert Mercer and Peter Thiel. The Trump campaign has said that Thiel helped it with data. A campaign that was led by Steve Bannon, who was then at Cambridge Analytica.\n\nA leading QC who spends a lot of time in the investigatory powers tribunal said that the problem with this technology was that it all depended on whose hands it was in.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s being done by companies and governments who say \u2018you can trust us, we are good and democratic and bake cakes at the weekend\u2019. But then the same expertise can also be sold on to whichever repressive regime.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, we still trust our government. We respect our authorities to uphold our laws. We trust the rule of law. We believe we live in a free and fair democracy. Which is what, I believe, makes the last part of this story so profoundly unsettling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump with Peter Thiel, one of his key Silicon Valley supporters. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe details of the Trinidad project finally unlocked the mystery that was AggregateIQ. Trinidad was SCL\u2019s first project using big data for micro-targeting before the firm was acquired by Mercer. It was the model that Mercer was buying into. And it brought together all the players: the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, AggregateIQ, Chris Wylie, and two other individuals who would play a role in this story: Mark Gettleson, a focus group expert who had previously worked for the Lib Dems. And Thomas Borwick, the son of Victoria Borwick, the Conservative MP for Kensington.\n\nWhen my article linking Mercer and Leave.EU was published in February, no one was more upset about it than former Tory adviser Dominic Cummings, the campaign strategist for Vote Leave. He launched an irate Twitter tirade. The piece was \u201cfull of errors & itself spreads disinformation\u201d \u201cCA had ~0% role in Brexit referendum\u201d.\n\nA week later the Observer revealed AggregateIQ\u2019s possible link to Cambridge Analytica. Cummings\u2019s Twitter feed went quiet. He didn\u2019t return my messages or my emails.\n\nQuestions had already been swirling about whether there had been any coordination between the Leave campaigns. In the week before the referendum, Vote Leave donated money to two other Leave groups \u2013 \u00a3625,000 to BeLeave, run by fashion student Darren Grimes, and \u00a3100,000 to Veterans for Britain, who both then spent this money with AggregateIQ.\n\nThe Electoral Commission has written to AggregateIQ. A source close to the investigation said that AggregateIQ responded by saying it had signed a non-disclosure agreement. And since it was outside British jurisdiction, that was the end of it. Vote Leave refers to this as the Electoral Commission giving it \u201ca clean bill of health\u201d.\n\nOn his blog, Dominic Cummings has written thousands of words about the referendum campaign. What is missing is any details about his data scientists. He \u201chired physicists\u201d is all he\u2019ll say. In the books on Brexit, other members of the team talk about \u201cDom\u2019s astrophysicists\u201d, who he kept \u201ca tightly guarded secret\u201d. They built models, using data \u201cscraped\u201d off Facebook.\n\nFinally, after weeks of messages, he sent me an email. We were agreed on one thing, it turned out. He wrote: \u201cThe law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising.\u201d But, he says, \u201cby encouraging people to focus on non-stories like Mercer\u2019s nonexistent role in the referendum you are obscuring these important issues\u201d.\n\nAnd to finally answer the question about how Vote Leave found this obscure Canadian company on the other side of the planet, he wrote: \u201cSomeone found AIQ [AggregateIQ] on the internet and interviewed them on the phone then told me \u2013 let\u2019s go with these guys. They were clearly more competent than any others we\u2019d spoken to in London.\u201d\n\nThe most unfortunate aspect of this \u2013 for Dominic Cummings \u2013 is that this isn\u2019t credible. It\u2019s the work of moments to put a date filter on Google search and discover that in late 2015 or early 2016, there are no Google hits for \u201cAggregate IQ\u201d. There is no press coverage. No random mentions. It doesn\u2019t even throw up its website. I have caught Dominic Cummings in what appears to be an alternative fact.\n\nBut what is an actual fact is that Gettleson and Borwick, both previously consultants for SCL and Cambridge Analytica, were both core members of the Vote Leave team. They\u2019re both in the official Vote Leave documents lodged with the Electoral Commission, though they coyly describe their previous work for SCL/Cambridge Analytica as \u201cmicro-targeting in Antigua and Trinidad\u201d and \u201cdirect communications for several PACs, Senate and Governor campaigns\u201d.\n\nAnd Borwick wasn\u2019t just any member of the team. He was Vote Leave\u2019s chief technology officer.\n\nThis story may involve a complex web of connections, but it all comes back to Cambridge Analytica. It all comes back to Mercer. Because the connections must have been evident. \u201cAggregateIQ may not have belonged to the Mercers but they exist within his world,\u201d David told me. \u201cAlmost all of their contracts came from Cambridge Analytica or Mercer. They wouldn\u2019t exist without them. During the whole time the referendum was going on, they were working every day on the [Ted] Cruz campaign with Mercer and Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ built and ran Cambridge Analytica\u2019s database platforms.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: James Melaugh\n\nCummings won\u2019t say who did his modelling. But invoices lodged with the Electoral Commission show payments to a company called Advanced Skills Institute. It takes me weeks to spot the significance of this because the company is usually referred to as ASI Data Science, a company that has a revolving cast of data scientists who have gone on to work with Cambridge Analytica and vice versa. There are videos of ASI data scientists presenting Cambridge Analytica personality models and pages for events the two companies have jointly hosted. ASI told the Observer it had no formal relationship with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nHere\u2019s the crucial fact: during the US primary elections, Aggregate IQ signed away its intellectual property (IP). It didn\u2019t own its IP: Robert Mercer did. For AggregateIQ to work with another campaign in Britain, the firm would have to have had the express permission of Mercer. Asked if it would make any comment on financial or business links between \u201cCambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon, AggregateIQ, Leave.EU and Vote Leave\u201d, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said: \u201cCambridge Analytica did no paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU.\u201d\n\nThis story isn\u2019t about cunning Dominic Cummings finding a few loopholes in the Electoral Commission\u2019s rules. Finding a way to spend an extra million quid here. Or (as the Observer has also discovered )underdeclaring the costs of his physicists on the spending returns by \u00a343,000. This story is not even about what appears to be covert coordination between Vote Leave and Leave.EU in their use of AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica. It\u2019s about how a motivated US billionaire \u2013 Mercer and his chief ideologue, Bannon \u2013 helped to bring about the biggest constitutional change to Britain in a century.\n\nBecause to understand where and how Brexit is connected to Trump, it\u2019s right here. These relationships, which thread through the middle of Cambridge Analytica, are the result of a transatlantic partnership that stretches back years. Nigel Farage and Bannon have been close associates since at least 2012. Bannon opened the London arm of his news website Breitbart in 2014 to support Ukip \u2013 the latest front \u201cin our current cultural and political war\u201d, he told the New York Times.\n\nBritain had always been key to Bannon\u2019s plans, another ex-Cambridge Analytica employee told me on condition of anonymity. It was a crucial part of his strategy for changing the entire world order.\n\n\u201cHe believes that to change politics, you have to first change the culture. And Britain was key to that. He thought that where Britain led, America would follow. The idea of Brexit was hugely symbolically important to him.\u201d\n\nOn 29 March, the day article 50 was triggered, I called one of the smaller campaigns, Veterans for Britain. Cummings\u2019s strategy was to target people in the last days of the campaign and Vote Leave gave the smaller group \u00a3100,000 in the last week. A small number of people they identified as \u201cpersuadable\u201d were bombarded with more than a billion ads, the vast majority in the last few days.\n\nI asked David Banks, Veterans for Britain\u2019s head of communications, why they spent the money with AggregateIQ.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t find AggegrateIQ. They found us. They rang us up and pitched us. There\u2019s no conspiracy here. They were this Canadian company which was opening an office in London to work in British politics and they were doing stuff that none of the UK companies could offer. Their targeting was based on a set of technologies that hadn\u2019t reached the UK yet. A lot of it was proprietary, they\u2019d found a way of targeting people based on behavioural insights. They approached us.\u201d\n\nIt seems clear to me that David Banks didn\u2019t know there might have been anything untoward about this. He\u2019s a patriotic man who believes in British sovereignty and British values and British laws. I don\u2019t think he knew about any overlap with these other campaigns. I can only think that he was played.\n\nAnd that we, the British people, were played. In his blog, Dominic Cummings writes that Brexit came down to \u201cabout 600,000 people \u2013 just over 1% of registered voters\u201d. It\u2019s not a stretch to believe that a member of the global 1% found a way to influence this crucial 1% of British voters. The referendum was an open goal too tempting a target for US billionaires not to take a clear shot at. Or I should say US billionaires and other interested parties, because in acknowledging the transatlantic links that bind Britain and America, Brexit and Trump, so tightly, we also must acknowledge that Russia is wrapped somewhere in this tight embrace too.\n\nFor the last month, I\u2019ve been writing about the links between the British right, the Trump administration and the European right. And these links lead to Russia from multiple directions. Between Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nA map shown to the Observer showing the many places in the world where SCL and Cambridge Analytica have worked includes Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Iran and Moldova. Multiple Cambridge Analytica sources have revealed other links to Russia, including trips to the country, meetings with executives from Russian state-owned companies, and references by SCL employees to working for Russian entities.\n\nWhat Brexit should have taught us about voter manipulation | Paul Flynn Read more\n\nArticle 50 has been triggered. AggregateIQ is outside British jurisdiction. The Electoral Commission is powerless. And another election, with these same rules, is just a month away. It is not that the authorities don\u2019t know there is cause for concern. The Observer has learned that the Crown Prosecution Service did appoint a special prosecutor to assess whether there was a case for a criminal investigation into whether campaign finance laws were broken. The CPS referred it back to the electoral commission. Someone close to the intelligence select committee tells me that \u201cwork is being done\u201d on potential Russian interference in the referendum.\n\nGavin Millar, a QC and expert in electoral law, described the situation as \u201chighly disturbing\u201d. He believes the only way to find the truth would be to hold a public inquiry. But a government would need to call it. A government that has just triggered an election specifically to shore up its power base. An election designed to set us into permanent alignment with Trump\u2019s America.\n\nMartin Moore of King\u2019s College, London, pointed out that elections were a newly fashionable tool for would-be authoritarian states. \u201cLook at Erdo\u011fan in Turkey. What Theresa May is doing is quite anti-democratic in a way. It\u2019s about enhancing her power very deliberately. It\u2019s not about a battle of policy between two parties.\u201d\n\nThis is Britain in 2017. A Britain that increasingly looks like a \u201cmanaged\u201d democracy. Paid for by a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us. If we let this referendum result stand, we are giving it our implicit consent. This isn\u2019t about Remain or Leave. It goes far beyond party politics. It\u2019s about the first step into a brave, new, increasingly undemocratic world.\n\nKey names\n\n\n\nSCL Group\n\nBritish company with 25 years experience in military \u201cpsychological operations\u201d and \u201celection management\u201d.\n\nCambridge Analytica\n\nData analytics company formed in 2014.
