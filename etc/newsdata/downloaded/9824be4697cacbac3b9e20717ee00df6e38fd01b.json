I wasn't even expecting that. I had the number jersey on in the beginning. I came in, everybody was waiting for me, pregame rituals. He pulled out the jersey with the C on it. I still have it. I'm not giving it back,\u2019 he laughed.\n\nIt was an emotional day for Efe Obada as he returned to London to play in an NFL game\n\nThe defensive lineman was named honorary captain for Carolina's win over Tampa Bay\n\nHe only picked up the game five years ago, and enjoyed his 'special' return to England\n\nAfter the game, Obada was handed one of three game balls by head coach Ron Rivera. Said Rivera: \u2018There's several of these young men, all they've ever wanted was an opportunity. That's all we've done, we've been able to give those guys an opportunity. He epitomises a story of a young man who all he needs was an opportunity.\u2019\n\nObada played a quarter of the Panthers\u2019 defensive snaps (21/84) and was initially credited with a sack after wrestling Bucs quarterback Jameis Winston to the ground late in the second quarter.\n\nBut it was Vernon Butler who knocked the ball out of Winston\u2019s hand, with Obada forcing the fumble before Bruce Irvin recovered the ball. On a day when Winston was sacked seven times, the play perfectly illustrated Carolina\u2019s swarming defense.\n\n\u2018I didn't even see the ball. It was only until I got to the sideline that people started telling me the ball came out. I thought he got sacked. Our defense today,\u2019 Obada said.\n\n\u2018We knew we had to get out there. That's what we did. They got away with one earlier in the season. This game was very important, very important to me, it was very important to the team as well. All family there, they saw that. We just rallied around each other, went after it.\u2019\n\nObada first played American football five years ago and is still familiarising himself with the sport.\n\nCarolina switched their base defense from a 4-3 to a 3-4 in the offseason and Obada lined up at defensive end and nose tackle.\n\n\u2018It's expanding my knowledge of the game. It's made me more versatile. It also shows a belief this team has in me, to be able to put me in situations. Honestly, I'll play anywhere. I'll play safety if it helps this team win,\u2019 he said.\n\nBut as the reality hit home, Obada admitted to being overwhelmed by the occasion, describing the day as: \u2018Everything and more.\u2019\n\n\u2018When we were coming out the tunnel, it was electric. I had family in the stands. Most of them don't even understand what I'm doing, but they believe in me, have been supporting me for years. For me to be in London, just show them, it was real special.\u2019\n\n\u2018There were a lot of stages in my life that if someone told me I would be here right now, I'd laugh at them. But I'm here.\n\n\u2018That one is going to stay with me for the rest of my life. Who would have thought? Like, yeah, sorry,\u2019 he added, tearing up.", "description": "Efe Obada struggled to hold back the tears after an overwhelming return to London.\u00a0The defensive lineman was made an honorary team captain before the Carolina Panthers' 37-26 win.", "authors": ["Peter Carline For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/23/19669354-0-image-a-55_1571007159634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
