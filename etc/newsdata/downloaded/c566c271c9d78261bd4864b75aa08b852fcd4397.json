If he can hold onto his lead through the remaining seven holes on Monday, he will reach 82 wins and tie the career record held by Sam Snead.\n\nMatsuyama made things interesting when he finished with back-to-back birdies on Nos. 11 and 12. Before that he was five strokes back which would have put him in a difficult position on Monday.\n\nMatsuyama started the fourth round at the Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club course three strokes back of Woods after completion of the third round earlier Sunday when Woods shot 4-under 66. In the fourth round, the Japanese star faltered with two bogeys on the front nine but made up for it with his two birdies on his final two holes.\n\nWoods got off to a strong start to the fourth round with a birdie on the first hole.\n\nHis only trouble of the day came when his tee shot on the par-4 No. 4 went into the rough. His second shot was a routine chip shot from the side of the green which was short, barely reaching the green. He then two-putted for his only bogey of the fourth round.\n\nWoods came right back with a birdie on the next hole and added another on the sixth.\n\nBecause torrential rain washed out play on Friday, the second round was moved to Saturday. To make up for the lost day, the players started the fourth round immediately after finishing the third to get in as many holes as possible.\n\nGary Woodland was tied in third place at 12-under with Sungjae Im, while Rory McIlroy, the highest-ranked player in the field, was fifth at 11-under with just two holes to play.\n\nWoods last played in an official tournament in Japan in 2006 at the Dunlop Phoenix, where he lost in a playoff to Padraig Harrington. He won the Dunlop Phoenix the two previous years.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
