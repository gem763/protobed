One at a time, the seven women who had strained to stay in its glow faded into the dark until Dina Asher-Smith was all alone, a British woman on top of the world.\n\nAnd so she went for a little dance.\n\nShe danced on the track, she danced to the stands and then she danced her way back with a Union flag, which is now planted on the summit. A 200m gold medal for her, a gold medal for her country and a golden cloak for a team and organisation that has found itself coated in something far more mucky in the past 48 hours.\n\nDina Asher-Smith obliterated the field to win the women's 200m in a national record 21.88sec\n\nAsher-Smith celebrates after winning gold at the World Athletics Championships in Doha\n\nAfter adding gold to 100m silver, she is now targeting a hat-trick of medals in 4x100m relay\n\nFor them, those embattled souls at UK Athletics, what a shiny relief. The Alberto Salazar mess will not be easily cleaned, but for now, maybe only for a night or two, they can celebrate. They can celebrate a temporary shift in the narrative and they can celebrate the rise to excellence of a world beater in British colours.\n\nSome perspective, at this point \u2013 this was not an Olympic-class final. Indeed, the joke was that Asher-Smith could transport an egg on a spoon with both feet in a sack and still beat those runners with a half-decent dip.\n\nBut for those who use that as a caveat, consider this: her winning time of 21.88sec was not only a British record. It also would have been good enough for gold at 13 of the 17 World Championships.\n\nIn taking this one, Britain for the first time in history has a female short-range sprint champion. Across 100m and 200m, at an Olympics or a World Championships, it had never happened. But Asher-Smith had already stopped one clock with her 100m silver on Sunday \u2013 Britain's first female medallist at the distance since 1960 \u2013 and here she broke new ground entirely.\n\nWhen it was done, she targeted the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics next year. Holding back tears, she said: 'I am getting all emotional, this means a lot, I am really happy. I will enjoy this one and use it as motivation to get into the big one next year.'\n\nShe added: 'Being an athlete is very humbling. I train six days a week. Exactly the Same place. Pushing yourself to the limit is very unglamorous when you've lactic on the floor. Ultimately you're only ever as good as your last performance.\n\nAsher-Smith with her coach John Blackie after winning the women's 200m on Wednesday\n\n'To be at the point I am now, being world champion, means so, so much.'\n\nWith a breath, she went again. 'Everyone said, \"You are the favourite\" but you still have to go and do it and you have to perform. I was focused on that. I have dreamt of this and now it's real.'\n\nThe bare detail of the race is this: they were beaten by the bend.\n\nFrom the blocks she was out quickest and the gap only grew, through those first two steps that accelerate a sprinter to 50 per cent of their top speed, through the balance-test of a drive phase around the corner and finally through the straight run for home. By the time she was done, she had gone from A to B 0.01sec quicker than the national record she set in winning European gold last summer.\n\n'Normally I am so chatty and full of energy, but I am lost for words,' the 23-year-old said\n\nThis was a far bigger prize that cemented beyond doubt her position as the leading lady of British sport. The margin to second? A relative mile at 0.34sec, with Brittany Brown of the US taking silver in a personal best of 22.22sec. Mujinga Kambundji of Switzerland was third in 22.51sec.\n\nIt will obviously be far more difficult in Tokyo. In truth, a woman who had no need for luck found plenty in the desert, such was the incredible misfortune to befall the world's other elite runners.\n\nIt started with Shaunae Miller-Uibo being told the schedule would not permit her to run both the 200m and 400m. Given she is the Olympic champion at the latter, she skipped the former, in which she is unbeaten at 200m. That helped.\n\nThis cemented beyond doubt Asher-Smith's position as the leading lady of British sport\n\nBut irrespective, that still left a world-class field until, in some kind of order, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce opted against running and Dafne Schippers, Marie-Josee Ta Lou and Blessing Okagbare fell to a mixture of injuries and disqualification. By the semi-finals, only the Olympic 200m champion Elaine Thompson stood as a serious obstacle and then she withdrew with an Achilles problem.\n\nBut what was it Arnold Palmer used to say? 'The more I practice the luckier I get?'\n\nAsher-Smith was joint favourite to win before the opposition dropped like flies, and she was a shoe-in by the time they did. She deserves a gold without caveats. And she has one, a star like no other in a team that badly needed one.", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI IN DOHA: Out of the sandstorm of a quite miserable World Championships came a magnificent ray of red, white and blue light.", "authors": ["Riath Al-Samarrai For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/22/19226680-0-image-a-58_1570051245734.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
