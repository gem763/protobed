But China dominates the supply chain, and fears that it could manipulate the market has kept investors away, even as the U.S. and Canadian government discuss ways to help foster the sector in North America.\n\n\u201cThe (mining) project is not forgotten, it\u2019s still within the company,\u201d said Mugerman, \u201cbut today to bring it to value is very hard. It\u2019s a very high risk for a company to begin committing hundreds of millions of dollars when you don\u2019t control your destiny \u2014 if the price goes up, China can still bring it down.\u201d\n\nMugerman says that since he started as chief executive in 2015 it\u2019s been clear that the half a billion dollar mining project would need to be shelved.\n\nInstead, he spent the past few years studying recycling methods, and stockpiling old rare earth magnets\u2019 waste. Earlier this month, Geomega released plans for a plant that would cost $2.5 million to build and would have an estimated $30 million in annual revenue.\n\nHe\u2019s hopeful that if they bring the plant online in 2020, and start generating cash flow, the company can still open the mine one day.\n\n\u201cWe want to sell to anybody but China,\u201d said Mugerman. \u201cYou want to stay small because you basically want to stay under the radar as long as possible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the only company that is looking to enter downstream from mining.\n\nIn Vancouver, Don Lay, chief executive of Medallion Resources, said his company is studying ways to extract rare earths from a byproduct of heavy mineral sands mining, known as monazite.\n\nIt remains years away from production, but Lay said one likely advantage over building a mine is that construction costs are expected to be under $25 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to look more like a chemical company than a mining company,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s dominance of the sector is well-known. It produced 70 per cent of world supply in 2018, down from 80.5 per cent in 2017, and controls 36.6 per cent of world reserves, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nRare earths include 17 different elements always found together, which though fairly abundant in the earth\u2019s surface, rarely occur in high concentrations to justify building a mine.\n\nMine production constitutes only one piece of the supply chain: After the ore is mined, the rare earths needs to be processed and separated, and then undergo further processing into alloys, which again may be converted into magnets, catalysts or other intermediate product. Those also are inserted into final products such as a wind turbine or an electric vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe actual problem is not the lack of mines,\u201d said Ryan Castilloux, managing director of research firm Adamas Intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s how to take them and convert them into the materials.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of a single mine in California, known as Mountain Pass, North America almost entirely lacks a supply chain.\n\nWhile Canada may have abundant resources, and several rare earth deposits have already been identified, the high price tag of building a mine \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars at a minimum \u2014 deters many investors, said Castilloux.\n\nThe idea that China could weaponize rare earths, possibly through an export ban or another way, gained currency in May when Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by a trade negotiator, visited a rare earth magnet factory for a photo op. Already, the country has raised tariffs from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on imports of rare earths from Mountain Pass.\n\nThat mine has become a cautionary tale, after being built in 2010 by Molycorp., which gained billions of dollars in market capitalization, only to face bankruptcy in 2015 after prices crashed. In 2017, a consortium of investors including China\u2019s Leshan Shenghe Rare Earth Co. bought the mine for US$20.5 million.\n\n\n\nThis summer, various Canadian executives in the sector perked up when they saw the U.S. government put out requests for proposals for downstream rare earths\u2019 processing capacity.\n\nLay of Medallion Resources, said he\u2019s had a number of conversations with Canadian officials in recent months and expressed hope it would lead to opportunities.\n\nLast month, the Globe and Mail reported that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump met in June to discuss collaboration on a reliable supply chain.\n\nCastilloux, of Adamas Intelligence, said he\u2019s seen governments take a look at the space in the past.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s encouraging to see these alliances forming, but they\u2019re not entirely unique,\u201d he said. \u201cThe argument has been going for awhile that rare earths are so opaque, and China kind of uses them as a weapon, (but) you have to see what kind of traction it gets.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s industry is dominated by state-owned enterprises, and the potential for subsidies to any part of the supply chain, whether it be to the oxides or the magnets, poses a threat.\n\nThe problem in Canada is how to build an entire supply chain: A mine without a downstream processing presents risks to investors, but the opposite is also true.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to have some visionary person like Elon Musk that\u2019s self-financed, just come out and say, \u2018enough is enough, we\u2019re going to close this gap,\u2019\u201d said Castilloux.\n\nBut it\u2019s a small market, about 170,000 tons produced per year, so the strategic value of rare earths may outweigh their economic value.\n\nDavid Merriman, manager of the electric vehicles materials division for Roskill, a research firm, said the \u201cmillion dollar question\u201d is to what extent a North American or European industry needs government subsidies to compete.\n\nHe noted rare earths have enabled various technological advances, adding an estimated 10 per cent to the range of an electric vehicle, for example.\n\nBut in addition to production capacity, China also holds a lot of expertise for things like rare earth magnets, which are crucial to motors in electric vehicles or wind turbines, Merriman said.\n\n\u201cIt has been a long play (by China),\u201d said Nils Backeberg, manager of steel alloy research at Roskill. \u201cProbably over 20 or 30 years.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz", "description": "China controls three-quarters of the global market and nobody, especially investors, wants to mess with that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/rare-earth.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
