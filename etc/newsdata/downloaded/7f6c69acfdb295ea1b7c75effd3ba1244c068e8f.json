Town Hall On Sexual Abuse", "language": "en", "text": "Actor Amber Heard, who in 2016 accused ex-husband Johnny Depp of domestic violence abuse, revealed the painful aftermath of her experience at an event Thursday on sexual violence during the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cWhat I survived was not the worst that happened to me. It was what happened after,\u201d Heard said Thursday, speaking to ambassadors and other international government leaders at the European Union\u2019s mission to the United Nations. The event at U.N. headquarters in New York City was organized by Rise, a sexual assault advocacy group, which said it was the first such survivor town hall at the United Nations.\n\nHeard urged ambassadors to support a U.N. resolution enshrining sexual violence survivors\u2019 rights, such as the right to terminate legal ties with one\u2019s assailant and the right to rape kit procedures.\n\nHeard accused Depp of domestic abuse in their 2016 divorce proceedings. (Depp has denied the abuse and filed a defamation suit against Heard this year.)\n\nShe said that after coming forward with her abuse allegations she faced daily death threats and \u201crelentless and persistent assaults on my character.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m me,\u201d she said, after describing herself as a \u201crelatively high-profile white woman\u201d in the entertainment industry. \u201cImagine the fate of lower-income women, religious and ethnic minorities\u2026. Imagine how much worse it is for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Me Too movement has done a great deal\u2026 we need to take our outrage and determination to end sexual violence and we need to codify it,\u201d Heard added. \u201cMy story matters. My assault matters.\u201d\n\nHeard was among a handful of other survivors \u2015 including actor Olivia Munn and athlete Sarah Klein, the first known gymnast to be abused by former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar \u2015 who spoke at the event.\n\nSo excited to have Sister Survivors here w us.

Last year, Klein and Morgan McCaul, who also spoke Thursday, were among the at least 169 survivors and family members who read powerful statements about Nassar\u2019s abuse at his Michigan trial. Nassar is now serving a life sentence in prison for child sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cWe were able to collectively do what one of us alone never could have done,\u201d Klein said. \u201cFinally put our abuser away for life.\u201d\n\nShe described rape as \u201ccommon,\u201d \u201crarely punished\u201d and \u201call too often blamed on the victim.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has to end,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe will no longer stand silent. We will no longer be ashamed.\u201d\n\nMunn also pushed for passage of a U.N. survivors\u2019 rights resolution.\n\nMunn was one of six women who accused Brett Ratner, a Hollywood producer, of sexual harassment and misconduct in 2017. She addressed her words Thursday \u201cto the survivors in the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe certain things happen to certain people\u2026 to face the rain and walk right back into it and change the course of the storm,\u201d Munn said. \u201cYou are seen, you are heard, you are believed and I love you.\u201d", "description": "Actor Olivia Munn and women victimized by gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar also spoke about sexual violence during the United Nations General Assembly.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8d596721000034005f0de3.jpeg?cache=ig9lbfo8s7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
