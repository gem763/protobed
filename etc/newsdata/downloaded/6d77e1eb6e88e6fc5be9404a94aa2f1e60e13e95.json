Harris is founding editor of POLITICO and author of \"The Survivor: Bill Clinton in the White House.\"\n\nBig font, double-decker headlines, home page takeovers: It\u2019s been a big week in the news business for visual devices like these.\n\nEditors turn to these once- or twice-a-year headlines to signal to the reader something more than that the news is BIG. Almost by definition in the modern media environment, when the news is big enough to justify a big type it\u2019s also news that the reader already knows. Heard about it, probably, within moments after it happened.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat the editors are really trying to say is that the moment is solemn, something of unquestionable gravity and universal relevance.\n\nTo which the reaction of many readers these days is: Yeah, sure, whatever\u2026..\n\nIt is too early to tell what will come of House Democrats\u2019 decision to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, but not too early to conclude that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has failed to revive the concept of solemnity in American politics.\n\nThat was the obvious intent Tuesday, when she stood in front of a bank of flags, invoking the Founding Fathers and Constitutional Convention of 1787, as she announced the impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut the reaction, underway even before she started speaking, made clear that for much of the country, it was just another day in what Rahm Emanuel, when he was Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, called the metropolis of \u201cFucknutsville.\u201d The news may be important, it may be swerving wildly in surprising ways, but never these days is it something that commands reverent attention.\n\nPeople below a certain age may not have first-hand experience with news events that did indeed command that reaction \u2014 and impeachment proceedings against a president unambiguously would have been one of them.\n\nAs it happens, I\u2019m above that age. Of four major efforts in U.S. history to impeach presidents, I have vivid, contemporaneous images in mind for three of them.\n\nI was a 10-year-old at summer camp during the last days of Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency. As his situation daily became more dire, I recall receiving a letter from my then-Republican mother, reflecting sadly on the country\u2019s wounds, how disgraceful it was that the president had dishonored his office. For the actual resignation speech, aware that history was unfolding, the camp rolled out black-and-white televisions into the cafeteria, and campers listened raptly to Nixon\u2019s words.\n\nTwenty-three years later, I was a Washington Post reporter in January 1998, working late at the White House as I knew colleagues were on the brink of reporting Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with a former intern named Monica Lewinsky. I was talking with Josh Gerstein, then a young producer for ABC News (and now a less-young journalist for POLITICO), whose organization also knew of the imminent bombshell. The atmosphere was a bit like in a sci-fi movie in which an asteroid is hurtling toward earth. The news seemed beyond belief, the implications grave. We might be hours away from a presidential resignation.\n\nIt took a little more than a year from that night until February 1999, when Bill Clinton survived his impeachment by the House with a mostly party-line vote acquittal at a Senate trial. In retrospect, it seems clear what a critical moment of transition the Clinton impeachment \u2014 for that matter, the entire Clinton presidency \u2014 was in the journey to Nutsville. The solemnity that I was (momentarily ) feeling in the pressroom that night was intermittently observed by most of the major actors during the drama that played out over the next 13 months.\n\nDuring the Senate trial, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wore robes that he had designed himself for the occasion, with four gold stripes on each sleeve. The getup drew widespread mockery.\n\nThat contrast \u2014 participants aspiring for dignity while being greeted by the audience with raucous irreverence \u2014 pretty much defined the year.\n\nMultiple features of the modern political-media culture that now scarcely draw notice \u2014 we live with them in every waking moment \u2014 essentially sprouted that year.\n\nThere was the notion that establishment news organizations were no longer the gatekeepers of the news or what right-minded people were supposed to think about the news. Internet pioneer Matt Drudge beat the Washington Post and Newsweek to their own scoops, with sources who told him of the debate in those newsrooms about whether the story was ready to publish. These days, with social media, everyone if they wish at any hour of the day can revel in the rubble of the old MSM filter.\n\nThis was also the beginning of saturation coverage of Washington, and the commercialization of political news. CNN went round the clock with Lewinksy special programming, as did its newborn rivals, MSNBC and Fox News. The hysteria-and-indignation industry was born.\n\nAbove all, the Clinton impeachment was the beginning of political news as Rorschach test \u2014 in which one side sees wickedness in a politician\u2019s behavior, and the other side sees wickedness in the disingenuous, hypocritical, malicious response of the opposition party to the behavior. (In a non-political context this phenomenon had begun a few years earlier in the O.J. Simpson case.)\n\nThe Clinton case lived easily in this dual reality \u2014 partly serious, partly entertainment \u2014 because of its subject matter. Oval Office fellatio does not lend itself to solemnity. (No, no, no, said Republicans, this isn\u2019t about sex! It\u2019s about lying under oath and the sacred principle that no one is above the law.)\n\nTrump\u2019s case, however, shows the essential reality \u2014 the significance of a piece of news depends mostly on how it can be used as either weapon or shield in the ceaseless ideological and cultural war \u2014 applies no matter the underlying subject matter.\n\nThe Clinton impeachment was about whether a president was getting head; the Trump impeachment is about whether a president abused his position as head of state. But the essential dynamic \u2014 accusers are shocked; defenders shrug \u2014 is unchanged.\n\nThe incomplete transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was read by Democrats as something close to a smoking gun, with Trump pushing his counterpart \u2014 who is hoping for military aid from Washington \u2014 to use his influence to revive a closed investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and the activities of his son, Hunter Biden, who performed highly compensated work for a well-connected Ukrainian natural gas company.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told POLITICO in a statement it is \u201claughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\u201d He said Democrats have \u201calready overplayed their hand.\u201d\n\nThis taunting dismissal of official proceedings is another sign of the death of solemnity. During the Lewinsky scandal, even many prominent Democrats were surprised and primly disapproving when Clinton pivoted during a televised speech acknowledging the affair into an attack on independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr. It\u2019s inappropriate, many argued, for a president to attack a legal proceeding.\n\nWith the passage of time, however, Clinton\u2019s words seem mild. (\u201cThe independent counsel investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And now the investigation itself is under investigation.\u201d)\n\nTrump, by contrast, this week called Democrats \u201cpirates\u201d and the Ukraine investigation \u201ca disgrace to our country\u201d and \u201canother witch hunt.\u201d\n\nSuch rhetoric from Trump is now so common that it hardly seems noteworthy. Hyperbole and bombast from partisans in this sense is like a drug that must be used in ever-larger dosages to be effective, or akin to a person who uses so much salt that he no longer remotely tastes the actual food underneath.\n\nThe deeper change is that most Americans no longer respect the institutions of Washington, and many believe at some fundamental level they are not on the level. The Gallup polling organization has been measuring this trend for decades. Back in the 1970s, when my mother and most Americans no matter their partisan affiliation were shocked by Nixon\u2019s lawbreaking, the presidency, the Congress, and the media all commanded majority or near-majority support when people were asked if they had high \u201cconfidence\u201d in the institutions. These days, none of these institutions is even close to majority support, and only 11 percent of people say they have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in Congress.\n\nThis trend may be a solemn development \u2014 but don\u2019t expect it to receive a lot of solemnity.\n\n", "description": "Impeachment proceedings used to be news of unquestionable gravity.
