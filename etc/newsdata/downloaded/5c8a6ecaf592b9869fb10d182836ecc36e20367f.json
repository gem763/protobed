The video, which marks the third day of their tour of South Africa, documents the family walking to meet Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his daughter, Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe. You can see a bit of the walking here:\n\nMeghan\u2019s sounds and then Harry talking to him and Archie making sounds back \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d my heart cant take it it\u2019s too early pic.twitter.com/kojbKba0bC \u2014 charlotte (@graciousmeghan) September 25, 2019\n\nAw. During the meeting, Prince Harry reportedly noted that Archie \u201cconstantly wants to stand.\u201d Oh, a little standing man! In response, Meghan said, \u201cHe\u2019s an old soul!\u201d And then Harry said, \u201cI think he is used to it already.\u201d\n\nYes, yes. He loves standing. He\u2019s used to standing (?) already. Oh yes, he\u2019s certainly an old \u2014 WHAT!\n\nOh my gosh. Yes, this is quite a scary bombshell, as you can tell by your own quivering limbs. Meghan Markle may have revealed that Baby Archie, who is potentially named after a cat who got fat after eating too many grapes, is merely a baby-shaped vessel for an \u2014 OLD GHOST!\n\nBut which old ghost? Well, that is certainly not for us to say. I\u2019m sure the tabloids would love us to believe it is the ghost of Diana. But is that not a bit crass? I suppose it could be the ghost of Meghan Markle\u2019s former cat; that would be appropriate. But would a cat \u201cconstantly\u201d want to stand? Hm. It\u2019s tough to say, because I would also assume a cat would not \u201cconstantly\u201d want to eat grapes, and yet.\n\nWe might never know, or I suppose it is possible we could know once Archie begins to speak. Until then, we can only guess and shake with fear. Oh, Archie, you sweet boy, you little man, you old soul \u2014 AHH!
