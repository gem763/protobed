Trading was briefly suspended after the dramatic leap.\n\nIf Alphabet bought the company it would help Google compete with Apple, which has the second largest share of the wrist-worn wearable tech market according to tech researcher IDC.\n\nFitbit announced that it was looking for a buyer earlier this year, after four years of decline following a disastrous public listing in 2015. Its share price has dwindled from almost $50 at its peak to just $4 a day before reports of Google's potential acquisition. An increasingly crowded wearable market, largely dominated by Apple, and lack of feature innovation has failed to inspire consumers to come back for new versions of its devices each year.\n\nShipments of wrist-worn technology such as smartwatches and fitness trackers have increased this year and annual sales are tipped to hit 152.7m devices this year, a 22pc increase from 2018, according to IDC. Fitbit sold 3.5m devices in the second quarter of 2019, up from 2.6m a year earlier, but has been overtaken by Xiaomi, Apple and Huawei.", "description": "Google's parent company Alphabet has reportedly made a bid for Fitbit, causing the troubled activity tracker company\u2019s shares to skyrocket.", "authors": ["Margi Murphy", "Us Technology Reporter", "Hannah Betts", "Tom Hoggins", "James Titcomb"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2017/06/26/Fitbit-Alta-HR-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxUyqX_wn5RMR1e0_62zP1dDVNe8Ao9gUfVc0hCcf6MU.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
