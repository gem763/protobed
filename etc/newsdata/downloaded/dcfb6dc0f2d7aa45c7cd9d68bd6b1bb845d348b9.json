I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d Lauer then asked her if she liked it. She tells him yes. She claims that \u2018she bled for days.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Nevils told Mr. Farrow: \u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent. It was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nMs. Nevils said after the night in Sochi, she continued a sexual relationship with Mr. Lauer but that it was \u201ccompletely transactional\u201d and she was terrified of Mr. Lauer having control of her career, Mr. Farrow wrote.\n\nVariety reported Mr. Lauer confirmed the sexual relationship in a letter but said the actions between him and Ms. Nevils were \u201cmutual and completely consensual\u201d and the allegations were \u201ccategorically false.\u201d\n\nMr. Lauer was fired in 2017 amid the burgeoning #MeToo movement after similar allegations of misconduct surfaced. Ms. Nevils, who was then unnamed, reported him for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.\u201d\n\nNBC News condemned its former employee\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer\u2019s conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague.\u201d\n\nCurrent \u201cToday\u201d show co-host Savannah Guthrie reacted Wednesday to the developments, calling them \u201cshocking and appalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe support her and any women who come forward with claims.\u201d\n\nCo-host Hoda Kotb added, \u201cThese are not allegations of an affair, there are allegations of a crime, and I think that\u2019s shocking to all of us here who have sat with Matt for many many years.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jessica Chasmar contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
