Michael Bennet on Wednesday said Democrats squandered a brief window when they had been able to go on offense on the issue of health care, pinning the blame on 2020 presidential rival Sen. Bernard Sanders and others for pushing a universal \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care plan.\n\nHe said Democrats had been playing defense on the issue for roughly a decade after Obamacare was signed into law in 2010 and Republicans kept trying to repeal it.\n\n\u201cAnd then they failed to do it,\u201d the Colorado Democrat said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cAnd for one blessed week, Democrats were on offense on health care and then Bernie introduced Medicare for all, six candidates got on, including Elizabeth [Warren] on that bill, and we\u2019ve been playing defense ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is the first president in American history to actually take insurance away from millions of Americans - we should make it very clear that Democrats are actually for universal coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking their health insurance away, and I think Medicare for all, unfortunately, muddies that message because it does make illegal insurance for 180 million Americans.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders\u2018 vision would ultimately do away with private insurance plans. Mr. Bennet and several other candidates have said such a move would be too much of a shock to the system and have instead advocated for a public insurance option.\n\nMr. Bennet said that if nothing else, Mr. Sanders is at least being honest about his proposal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been clear that it\u2019s going to cost new taxes of over $30 trillion; he\u2019s clear that he\u2019s going to make illegal all private insurance in the country except cosmetic insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
