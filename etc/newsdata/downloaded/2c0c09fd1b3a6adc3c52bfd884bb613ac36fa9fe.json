Good luck to colleagues in forthcoming GE.\u201d\n\nAmber Rudd MP (@AmberRuddHR) Moving on. Good luck to colleagues in forthcoming GE. Amber Rudd reveals she will not stand at next general election https://t.co/MPkxUrQa3b\n\nRudd quit the cabinet and gave up the Conservative whip in September over what she said at the time was Boris Johnson\u2019s seeming unwillingness to work for a Brexit deal. However, since then she has sought to return as a Tory.\n\nOn Tuesday, 10 of 21 other Conservative MPs who were stripped of the whip for supporting a backbench-instigated bill seeking to block a no-deal Brexit were re-admitted to the party.\n\nRudd said she planned to meet the Conservative chief whip, Mark Spencer, to formally seek a return: \u201cI\u2019m happy to leave the House of Commons as a Conservative MP.\u201d\n\nHowever, the party has indicated that Rudd, who has a majority of only 346 in her Hastings and Rye constituency, will not be welcomed back.\n\nRudd told the Standard that she had sought to make up with Johnson, with whom she has clashed fiercely several times over the years.\n\n\u201cI spoke to the prime minister and had a good meeting with him a few days ago,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really confident of my position. I will be leaving the House of Commons on perfectly good terms with the prime minister and I want him to succeed.\u201d\n\nAfter she left the cabinet, Rudd condemned Johnson\u2019s use of words such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d over Brexit, warning it could incite violence against opponents.\n\nComparing Johnson\u2019s language to that of Donald Trump, Rudd said: \u201cThe sort of language I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve seen more and more of coming out from No 10 does incite violence. It\u2019s the sort of language people think legitimises a more aggressive approach and sometimes violence.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2016 referendum, where Rudd campaigned strongly for remain, she said of Johnson: \u201cHe\u2019s the life and soul of the party but he\u2019s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.\u201d\n\nRudd became an MP in 2010 and climbed the junior ministerial ranks before replacing Theresa May as home secretary in 2016, when May entered Downing Street. However, she was forced to resign two years later after failing to properly account for her role in the Windrush scandal about the treatment of Caribbean Britons.\n\nShe returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary later the same year, but after Johnson replaced May she appeared increasingly uncomfortable with what she said was his pursuit of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHer decision takes to 50 the tally of MPs who have so far decided they will not re-contest their seats at the 12 December election, a relatively high proportion of the Commons.", "description": "Former home secretary once tipped as future Tory leader to quit at coming election", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b79c522c8ae1ecc3692d85f08f27c91ce353576d/0_54_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eca470f97025a30f53f0d08a1d6993c3", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
