There's eight weeks to go, and he's been in camp for four weeks already,\" Hearn told Fino Boxing.\n\n\"A lot of early sparring now is replicating the style of Ruiz.\n\n\"Last time we had probably three weeks of sparring, and it was tough to find a guy like Ruiz, because there aren't many like him.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Small, a little bit chubby, fast hands, and really good on the inside. Now we've replicated that, I feel like the preparation is going to be great.\"\n\nRuiz has attempted to improve himself as well, and has warned Joshua to look out for a more \"lighter, faster and more powerful\" fighter this time around.\n\n\"I will arrive in better condition.... lighter, faster and more powerful,\" Ruiz said to ESPN Deportes. \"They will believe that in December they will win.\n\n\"People will always talk like this, but I have faith that we're going to win and shut up more mouths\n\n\"I have a lot of respect for Anthony, outside the ring he is a very good man. But inside [the ring] there are no friends, there is no respect or anything.\n\n\"It will not be an easy fight. I think it will be a hard fight, but nothing is easy in life, so we are training very hard. We will be prepared for whatever he brings.\"", "description": "Anthony Joshua had never fought anyone like Andy Ruiz Jr before their first meeting and the Brit is refusing to get caught out again", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Afp Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20553838.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BOXING-HEAVYWEIGHT-RUIZ-JOSHUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
