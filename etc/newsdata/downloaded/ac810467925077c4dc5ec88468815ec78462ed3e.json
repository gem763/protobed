It was a rare show of solidarity in support of one of their own, Pavel Ustinov, a 23-year-old actor sentenced to three and a half years in prison in connection with recent anti-government protests.\n\nOn Monday, a judge controversially sided with state prosecutors in concluding Mr Ustinov deliberately injured an arresting officer.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

More such verdicts are expected in the coming days and weeks.\n\nOutside the presidential office on Wednesday, demonstrators unfurled messages in support of the imprisoned men.\n\nMonitored by a group of police officers, protesters were careful to walk the thin line of Russian law. Individual silent pickets are the only legal form of demonstration in Russia that are possible without a permit. Organisers regulated the queue to make sure no one was blocking movement of pedestrians \u2013 lest that be interpreted as a mass rally.\n\nThe theatre director Alexander Molochnikov, 27, one of the driving forces behind the protest, said he had \u201cno idea\u201d how successful the protest would ultimately be.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

On the other hand, there is the clear example of Ivan Golunov, which acts as our inspiration.\u201d\n\nIn June, investigative journalist Ivan Golunov, arrested on supposed drug-dealing charges, was subsequently released following a spirited campaign pointing at his innocence.\n\nIt was a rare U-turn from the Russian authorities, secured only after an intervention by the Kremlin.\n\nBut equally rare was the show of solidarity, with journalists of all colours coming together to ensure Mr Golunov\u2019s release. Wednesday\u2019s turnout suggested Russia\u2019s artistic community was beginning to respond in a similar fashion.\n\nMany of those attending said they were surprised by the numbers who had turned up. Tatyana Dogilyeva, 62, a star of Soviet cinema, told The Independent that it was \u201cevidence\u201d of her tradesmen \u201cbreaking the mould of conformity.\u201d\n\n\u201cA decade or four ago, it could never be like this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were all too timid, too dependent on government grants, too afraid to speak out.\u201d\n\nDisplaying a confidence that few of her younger colleagues were ready to express, Ms Dogilyeva said she was \u201csure\u201d the protest had already won.\n\n\u201cWe have biology on our side,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a generational conflict that the old men can\u2019t win. The Kremlin can put as much propaganda as they want on TV screens, but the kids are already using new technologies.\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday noon, there were clear signs that part of the establishment was turning \u2013 repeating the order of events that led to Mr Golunov\u2019s release in June. In the morning, Andrei Turchak, general secretary of the ruling United Russia party, made an unexpected intervention, describing the Ustinov verdict as \u201can outrageous injustice.\u201d A day earlier, dozens of church clerics signed an open letter calling for \u201cmercy.\u201d\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, while remaining characteristically non-committal, has also hinted at a possible route of securing Mr Ustinov\u2019s release.\n\nIn a delayed conference call with journalists on Wednesday, Mr Peskov said the Kremlin recognised the \u201cpublic outcry\u201d that the case had created.\n\n\u201cThere is a legal way of disputing a court decision, and that is to appeal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to wait for that appeal.\u201d", "description": "Anti-Kremlin protests took on an unusually colourful turn\u00a0on Wednesday \u2013 but it was less yellow vests and more a motley mix of ankle-length longcoats, frocks, and period costumes.", "authors": ["Oliver Carroll"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/14/Ustinov.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
