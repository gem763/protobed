(Robert Perry/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nA panel of three Scottish judges ruled Wednesday morning that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend Parliament was illegal, escalating an already passionate debate over whether the British prime minister respects the rule of law and throwing into even greater doubt his plans for Brexit.\n\nThe ruling does not mean that Parliament will immediately come back into session. But it does give the prime minister\u2019s opponents hope ahead of an expected Supreme Court case next week. Some even raised the prospect that Johnson will have to resign if he loses that case.\n\nThe Scottish judges ruled that the government had been misleading \u2014 including, perhaps, to the queen \u2014about its real reasons for the suspension and that it was \u201cunlawful because it had the purpose of stymying Parliament.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court case is likely to be heard on Tuesday after the prime minister\u2019s office said it would appeal the Scottish ruling. \u201cWe are disappointed by today\u2019s decision,\u201d the office said. A government spokesperson later ruled out recalling Parliament at least until the Supreme Court has a chance to weigh in.\n\nJohnson critics celebrated the court decision, saying they had been \u201cvindicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot break the law with impunity, Boris Johnson,\u201d Joanna Cherry, one of 75 lawmakers who brought the case in Scotland, told reporters outside the court in Edinburgh. \u201cThe rule of law will be upheld by Scotland\u2019s courts, and I hope also the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe leader of Cherry\u2019s Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon, called for Parliament to be \u201crecalled immediately to allow the essential work of scrutiny to continue.\u201d\n\nThe Labour Party joined that demand. \u201cThis ruling shows that, despite what Boris Johnson has spent his privileged life thinking, he is not above the law,\u201d said Shami Chakrabarti, Labour\u2019s point person on legal issues.\n\nMeanwhile, Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general, called for fellow Conservative Johnson to resign if it turns out that he \u201chad misled the queen about the reasons for suspending Parliament,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThat would be a very serious matter indeed. Indeed, in my view, it would then be the moment for Mr. Johnson to resign, and very swiftly.\u201d\n\nQueen Elizabeth II had agreed to prorogue \u2014 or suspend \u2014 Parliament, on the advice of the prime minister, as is customary.\n\nThe court battle over suspension could ultimately be a prelude to yet another legal battle that may arise from Brexit. Parliament last week passed a law requiring Johnson to seek an extension to the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union if Johnson cannot strike a deal before then.\n\n\n\nA pro-Brexit supporter is seen outside Parliament in London, Britain, June 17, 2019. (Hannah Mckay/Reuters)\n\nBut the prime minister has repeatedly insisted he will not request the delay \u2014 he said last week he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch \u2014 and unnamed advisers have told the British press that Downing Street intends to \u201csabotage\u201d the law.\n\nHard line Brexit lawmakers have gone farther, urging the prime minister to become \u201ca martyr\u201d to the cause and defy Parliament, even if it means being held in contempt of court and sent to jail. A survey by the polling firm YouGov this week found that 52 percent of Britons who backed \u201cleave\u201d in the Brexit referendum want Johnson to break the law if that\u2019s necessary to get Britain out of the E.U.\n\nCabinet ministers have played down the idea of the prime minister breaking the law, but have acknowledged that the government intends to \u201cchallenge the law to its limit.\u201d\n\nTo some, the brewing standoff \u2014 when coupled with the court challenge over suspension \u2014 reflects an inner circle around the prime minister that lacks the respect for laws and conventions that had been a given in previous governments.\n\n\u201cYou have a world of the rule of law, and you have a world of Dominic Cummings,\u201d said Iain McLean, a politics expert at the University of Oxford, referring to Johnson\u2019s chief strategist.\n\nChristopher Carman, a politics professor at the University of Glasgow, said he did not expect Johnson to go to jail. But he said Johnson\u2019s team would be \u201chuddled in Number 10, trying to figure out how they can strictly comply with the law but perhaps not the spirit of the law.\u201d\n\nHe noted that one idea recently discussed was Johnson sending the E.U. a request asking for a delay, along with a second letter saying that he didn\u2019t intend to use the delay.\n\nSuch a move would likely spawn a revolt in Parliament, where a majority of lawmakers, including renegade Conservatives, made clear last week they don\u2019t want a no-deal exit.\n\nParliament is not due to come back into session until mid-October under a plan that Johnson\u2019s critics have charged was aimed at leading Britain over the cliff-edge of no-deal before lawmakers had time to block it. But that appeared to backfire this week as lawmakers rebelled.\n\nSuspending Parliament is not unusual. It often happens once a year, usually around May, before the government lays out its legislative agenda. But the length of the break and the timing prompted outrage \u2014 as well as legal challenges.\n\n[Europeans once hoped the British would reverse Brexit. Now, many can\u2019t wait for them to leave.]\n\nAt five weeks, the suspension is the longest since 1945, and it comes during what many observers believe to be Britain\u2019s greatest peacetime crisis since the end of World War II.\n\nThousands of protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against what they called a \u201ccoup.\u201d And in the early hours of Tuesday, opposition lawmakers attempted to halt the suspension by physically preventing Speaker John Bercow from leaving his chair. They also held aloft signs reading \u201cSilenced,\u201d and chanted \u201cShame! Shame!\u201d at their Conservative colleagues in one of the rowdiest sessions that many longtime parliamentary observers could remember.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office said suspending Parliament was \u201cthe legal and necessary way\u201d for the government to \u201cbring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda.\u201d\n\nBut the judges found that that explanation was misleading, calling the government\u2019s behavior \u201can egregious case of a clear failure to comply with generally accepted standards of behavior of public authorities.\u201d\n\n\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson attends a year four history class with pupils during a visit to Pimlico Primary school in London on Sept. 10, 2019. (Toby Melville/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCherry said the suspension was intended to \u201cprevent us representing our constituents\u2019 views and to prevent us scrutinizing them as they try to take us through a back door toward a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s ruling contradicts two earlier judgments from last week. Judges for England and Wales had ruled that Johnson\u2019s move was legal. A Scottish judge, meanwhile, had decided that the courts did not have the authority to interfere in the suspension.\n\nWith Brexit in the balance, the outcome of the case next week could have high stakes. A return of Parliament would add even more unpredictability to an already confused environment, and give lawmakers greater chance to have their say as Johnson attempts to strike a deal with the E.U.\n\nWednesday\u2019s decision is \u201cincredibly bold,\u201d said McLean. \u201cBoris lied to the queen, is what it comes down to.\u201d\n\nHe said he still thought that the Supreme Court would rule the other way, \u201cand so it could be a weak victory for the anti-Brexiteers. But who knows?\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more\n\nA chaotic final night for Parliament leaves Johnson with bleak choices on the path to Brexit\n\nThe \u2018rebel alliance\u2019 teamed up to thwart Boris Johnson\u2019s plans.
