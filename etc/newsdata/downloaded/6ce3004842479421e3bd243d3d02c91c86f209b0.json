He was a backup cornerback with Houston.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAaron Colvin lost his job after a rough night against the Saints. (Getty)\n\nColvin gave up critical late-game reception\n\nThe Texans drew widespread criticism for the final play before Lutz\u2019s field goal that saw their secondary line up in soft coverage, allowing Saints receiver Ted Ginn to run free underneath the coverage to gain the nine yards needed to set up the field goal.\n\nI want to be sure I get the picture accurate. Here is the #Texans\u2019 corner alignment on the play that gave up the yardage which allowed the field goal. Ted Ginn is in the slot. Why the corners aren\u2019t in press with the safeties over the top, I\u2019m not sure. pic.twitter.com/ktz2rI66bc \u2014 Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) September 10, 2019\n\nGinn was lined up in the slot to the right of the formation in the image above. Colvin is the man in coverage lined up at the 41-yard line across from Ginn. It\u2019s unclear if Colvin was instructed to line up that deep or made a mistake on the play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\n#Texans released CB Aaron Colvin, per @AdamSchefter. Colvin had the \u201coff\u201d coverage on WR Ted Ginn, ultimately resulting in the surrendered yardage helping a game-winning #Saints field goal. Texans\u2019 Bill O\u2019Brien said the coverage was called by the staff. But Colvin pays the price. pic.twitter.com/sdlebYjmvU \u2014 Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) September 11, 2019\n\nColvin had a tough game all night\n\nRegardless, according to NFL research, he had a rough night overall and was responsible for allowing 117 yards and a touchdown through the air.\n\nColvin allowed 8 receptions for 117 yards and a TD in coverage on 9 targets last night per @PFF\n\n\n\n155.8 passer rating https://t.co/40DICUOVoY \u2014 NFL Research (@NFLResearch) September 11, 2019\n\nColvin still owed guaranteed money\n\nColvin signed a free-agent deal with the Texans in 2018 worth $34 million with $18 million guaranteed.\n\nHe was due $7.5 million in salary this season \u2014 the second year of his contract \u2014 which NFL Network reports was included in the guaranteed money.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Aaron Colvin reportedly lost his job after a rough night against the Saints.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EC0UAayDCC7K.j_oSmehJg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05OTQuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bC5HsrYjlU25tCeqbxYxYA--~B/aD0yNzE4O3c9MzQ5ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/a4851e90-d43a-11e9-bffc-6052de4a6f82", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
