The 11th hour decision came Thursday, just 24 hours before the proposed ban was set to take effect.\n\nThe court's ruling delays for at least one week Governor Andrew Cuomo's emergency executive action that would ban all flavored vaping products with the exception of menthol.\n\nVaping companies had sued to stop the state's ban.\n\nJudges have ruled in favor of the vaping industry, blocking New York's proposed ban of flavored products until at least October 18 (stock image)\n\nNY State health commissioner said the vaping industry wants to hook young people with 'potentially dangerous and deadly products'\n\nVapor Technology Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing business owners who sell vaping products, last week sued Cuomo and the state\u2019s Department of Health saying that the ban was 'in excess of their constitutional, statutory and administrative authority,' the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBut Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner said in a statement, the vaping industry is getting young people hooked with flavored 'potentially dangerous and deadly products.' Some of those enticing flavors include bubble gum and cotton candy.\n\nCuomo said, 'At a minimum [vaping] is addicting youth people to nicotine at a very early age.'\n\nEighteen people in the US have died after vaping, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo in calling for the proposed vaping ban on September 15 said: 'We do not know the long term-term health effects of the use of the product'\n\nThis gives companies like JUUL a reprieve until October 18 when both parties have their next court appearance scheduled and a judge's ruling on the temporary injunction is likely.\n\nDue to the alarming rate use by children, health officials have led the push for removing e-cigarettes from store shelves.\n\nFurthermore, there's more cause for concern as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention points to a rise of illness and death from vaping.\n\nEighteen people in the US have died after vaping, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday.\n\nThere are now 1,080 cases of vaping related illnesses across the US.\n\nAt his press conference in September announcing the proposed ban, Cuomo said the medical unknown is problematic.\n\n'We do not know the long term-term health effects of the use of the product.'", "description": "New York State's Appellate Court has blocked the ban of flavored e-cigarettes.
