But the final ceremony would take place in about 30 days, once the new mausoleum was built for him there.\n\nHis family are still bitter over the role Mnangagwa played in his ouster and had pushed for Mr Mugabe to be buried in his homestead of Zvimba, northwest of Harare.\n\nA former guerrilla who fought alongside Mr Mugabe against colonial forces, Mr Mnangagwa was fired as first vice-president by Mr Mugabe in 2017. Mr Mugabe branded him a \"traitor\".\n\nSoon after, protesters and military officers pressured Mr Mugabe to step down in what was widely seen as a struggle between Mr Mnangagwa's faction and loyalists to Grace inside the ruling ZANU-PF party.\n\nThe \"heroes\" monument, where more than 130 national figures are buried in black marble tombs, sits on a hilltop overlooking Harare. Mr Mugabe's first wife, Sally is also buried there.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HARARE] Former Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe will be given a state funeral on Saturday with a dozen African leaders expected to pay tribute to a man lauded as a colonial-era liberation hero. .
