Disinflationary pressures are also on the rise again with surveys showing companies have cut selling prices for three straight months in a bid to salvage orders.\n\n\"When you look at the global economy, factors the BOJ need to worry about keep increasing,\" said Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics at Oxford Economics. \"It would be hard for the BOJ to be too optimistic about the global outlook.\"\n\nCutting interest rates deeper into negative territory will be the key option when the BOJ next acts, although the central bank may accompany that with measures to mitigate the pain on financial institutions, sources have told Reuters.\n\nAt Thursday's meeting, the BOJ board may also discuss ways to address excessive declines in long-term rates that threaten the bank's policy aimed at controlling the yield curve.\n\nIts current policy - dubbed yield curve control - was introduced partly to prevent the yield curve from flattening too much, as excessive declines in long- and super long yields will erode profit margins of financial institutions.\n\nBut there may little the BOJ can do beyond reducing bond buying or issuing stronger warning against sharp yield falls, analysts say.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [TOKYO] Bank of Japan policymakers will debate the feasibility of ramping up already massive stimulus on Thursday but are expected to save their limited ammunition for a while longer, despite growing risks to the country's fragile economic recovery. .
