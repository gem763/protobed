But Trump reignited the feud Wednesday morning when he claimed the conflict \"has nothing to do with us.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump also asserted that Kurdish fighters, who allied with the U.S. and did a great deal of the fighting to defeat ISIS over the last half decade, were \u201cnot angels.\u201d\n\nThat prompted a few barbs from Graham, which Trump was then asked about at the later news conference.\n\n\"I hope President Trump is right in his belief that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria is of no concern to us, abandoning the Kurds won\u2019t come back to haunt us, ISIS won\u2019t reemerge, and Iran will not fill the vacuum created by this decision,\" Graham said Wednesday. \"However, I firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq.\"\n\nAnd in a tweet, Graham said that Trump's apparent indifference toward the Kurds \"completely undercut\" Pence and Pompeo on their impending trip to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, hampering their \"ability to end the conflict.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/00/db/a6829bdc43d68a65e83cd488b143/20191016-graham-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
