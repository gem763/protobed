If you hate Khabib and his team, why do you say bad things about people?\u2019\n\n(Image: MMA FOCUS/Youtube)\n\nMcGregor attempted to explain himself, responding: \"The disrespect they showed me in the build up to the fight, they sold items in the grocery with my face on it\u2026\"\n\nBut he was then cut off by the man, who continued: \"All the people? My father, my brother, you think are all cowards?\"\n\nMcGregor replied: \"Yes, yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Dagestani man continued: \"Why cowards? My father? What did he do to you? My brother, what did he do to you?\"\n\n(Image: MMA FOCUS/Youtube)\n\nAt that point, the bottle was thrown in McGregor's direction, which he was forced to dodge.\n\nThe man was bundled away by security guards.\n\n\"Shut up you fool,\" McGregor continually shouted as the man was being led out.\n\nThe incident comes after McGregor announced his return to the UFC Octagon on January 18, which will be his first fight since he suffered defeat to Nurmagomedov.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m in prime physical condition, I\u2019ve agreed the date with the company.\n\n\u201cAs far as the opponent, I have the opponent\u2019s name, but for me and the game that I\u2019m in, and from experience, if I was to give you people the name - which I would love to do - I know the UFC would flip it because they are a crafty company.\n\n\u201cFor me, here\u2019s this one, ask the UFC who the opponent is because I do not give a f*** who the opponent is.\"", "description": "A bottle was launched in the direction of McGregor as a Dagestani man claimed the Irishman was disrespectful", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Mma Focus Youtube"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20733410.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Conor-McGregor-Attacked-with-Bottle-in-Moscow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
