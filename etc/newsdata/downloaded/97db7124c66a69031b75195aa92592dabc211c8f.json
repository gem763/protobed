We got a sneak preview of what they will get with a Model 3 for a weekend, in the blisteringly fast Performance specification.\n\nNo car that costs \u00a336,500 can be described as cheap, but Tesla's Model 3 sells at a considerably lower price than its big sisters, the Model S and Model X, and is designed to take on BMW 3 Series level cars\n\nThere\u2019s a long waiting list for the Model 3 and Tesla has struggled to ramp up production to hit its own ambitious targets, whilst starring centre stage in one of the great stock market soap operas of the 21st century.\n\nYet, even if Tesla goes up in smoke and never manages to meet the bold dreams of its founder Elon Musk, who has cultivated a Henry Ford meets Bond villain public persona, the US billionaire\u2019s endeavours will have been a success.\n\nForget the noise around Musk for a moment and think about how astonishing it is that upstart Tesla has produced the benchmark electric cars that the world\u2019s mighty motor industry giants are measured against, with all their years of experience.\n\nEven now, seven years after the Model S launch, there are few rival electric cars from the big guns that have established themselves as the one to be measured against \u2013 only Jaguar\u2019s I-Pace has really achieved that.\n\nWho knows where the story goes from here, but with the Model 3\u2019s arrival purchasing a Tesla is now a much more viable option for a big slice of the British car-buying public \u2013 and this comes at exactly the same time as the focus on petrol and diesel cars and the environment has never been stronger.\n\nBuying a Tesla has been made a bit more attainable in recent weeks, as a price cut has shaved a few thousands off the Model 3, pulling the starting price down to just under \u00a336,500, including the \u00a33,500 government grant.\n\nSo, is the Model 3 good enough to tempt buyers out of their BMWs?\n\nHaving spent a weekend with one of the few Model 3s in Britain, I think it could be.\n\nThe first right hand drive Tesla Model 3s have begun to arrive with patient buyers in the UK, but Simon Lambert tested a left hand drive Performance version\n\nA family affair: The Model 3 is clearly a Tesla\n\nFor all its pioneering spirit, Tesla doesn\u2019t seem particularly keen to break one convention of the modern-day motor industry: all your cars need to look broadly the same.\n\nThe Model 3 is clearly a Tesla. In fact, the uninitiated may struggle to spot that it isn\u2019t a Model S at first glance, until they realise it is smaller and its proportions are a bit different.\n\nModel 3 vs 3 Series Tesla's Model 3 is seen as a rival for BMW's 3 series saloon. The 3 Series starts at a cheaper price, but perhaps a more similar specification level to a Model 3 Standard Range Plus is a 330i Sport and that is more expensive. Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus - \u00a336,490 after government grant BMW 3 Series 320i SE - \u00a332,565 BMW 3 Series 330i Sport - \u00a337,785\n\nThis family look is a theme of today\u2019s Audis BMWs, Mercedes Benzs and Jaguars, so Tesla can hardly be faulted for jumping that particular bandwagon.\n\nHowever, while I think its big brother Model S is one of the best looking cars on the road, the Model 3 looks a little gawky from some angles.\n\nThe rear end just doesn\u2019t have the elegance of a Model S and the front end and headlights give it a bit of a bug-eyed look.\n\nStill the latter has never been a problem for Porsche, so I shouldn\u2019t imagine many will mind, and overall the Model 3 still looks pretty handsome.\n\nThe deep glass of the huge front windscreen adds to the have-to-look-twice-to-see-if-that-really-works element of its appearance, but this is an absolute winner for the driver, on which I will elaborate more later in the review.\n\nThere's no mistaking the Model 3 as anything other than a Tesla, with the US electric car firm following the theme that most big car makers use today with a family look across ranges\n\nThe Model 3 is also a saloon not a hatchback like the Model S, something which catches many out who expect a rear hatch.\n\nMeanwhile, the doors just open like normal car doors; as even Elon has refrained from trying to fit the Model X\u2019s party trick Falcon Wing doors to a mass market \u2018affordable\u2019 family car.\n\nAfter all the questions that have been raised over quality control as Tesla rushes to get Model 3s made fast enough, I took a really close look over our test car but I couldn\u2019t find anything obviously wrong inside or out.\n\nThe Model 3 comes in a blessedly simple three specifications: the rear-wheel drive Standard Range Plus from \u00a336,490, and the two dual motor all-wheel drive Long Range and Performance versions, from \u00a345,490 and \u00a349,140.\n\nA recent price cut took about \u00a32,400 off the Standard and Long Range models and almost \u00a37,800 off the Performance to get to those prices.\n\nThe Standard car has a WLTP figure quoted range of 254 miles, 140mph top speed and 5.3 second 0 to 60mph time, while the main selling point of the Long Range is that it takes range up to 348 miles and is slightly quicker, at 145mph and 4.5 seconds to 60mph.\n\nWe had the Model 3 Performance version on test, which has a range of 329 miles, top speed of 162mph and supercar-rivalling 0 to 60mph time of 3.2 seconds.\n\nThis is Tesla\u2019s car that aims to tempt buyers away from their BMW M3s or Mercedes C63 AMGs and it rides on big 20 inch alloys, with a carbon fibre spoiler, performance brakes, lowered suspension and a track mode.\n\nAll that means it looks more aggressive than a standard Model 3, but it\u2019s much more subtle than those petrol-powered rivals \u2013 for some that will be an attraction giving it proper Q car status, but others will prefer extra flare and stare in their super saloon styling.\n\nThe Model 3 Performance version costs from \u00a349,140 after a recent price cut and has an official stated range of 329 miles, a 162mph top speed and can hit 60mph in 3.2 seconds\n\nDrag strip quick but it can still hustle in the bends: The Model 3 on the road\n\nThe Model 3 Performance\u2019s extra degree of subtlety for a super saloon is true on the road too.\n\nOver the weekend, I did journeys through London traffic between the office and home, along with a run down through the centre of town and out on the dual carriageway to visit friends in Southend. I also found time to get the Model 3 out onto some B roads and winding country lanes.\n\nWhether slugging through traffic, cruising at 70mph, or having a bit of fun in the countryside, it proves itself a fine companion.\n\nPootle along gently in town, or cruise on dual carriageways and motorways, and it\u2019s docile, comfortable and easy to drive \u2013 if a little hard riding thanks to those big 20 inch wheels.\n\nUnless you hit the accelerator hard there\u2019s no sudden surge and so no hint of quite how fast this car is. Pull out of a junction, join the motorway from a slip road, or just head off down a main road and there\u2019s very little drama.\n\nBut drama is something you wouldn\u2019t want in everyday traffic anyway. And most fast cars are a doddle to drive about in nowadays too, the only difference being that on the crawl down the high street you can signal there\u2019s a lot of power under the bonnet with the yowl of the exhaust.\n\nStep things up a gear (or don\u2019t as a Tesla doesn\u2019t actually have gears other than the option of forward and reverse) and you realise how fast the Model 3 is. It has a turn of pace that can not only easily leave others in the rear view mirror, but also feels shockingly quick.\n\nWith its linear power delivery, the 0 to 60mph experience in a fast Tesla is a truly discombobulating experience.\n\nThe deep front windscreen on the Model 3 gives excellent visibility for the driver, something that pays off when placing the car on winding B roads\n\nBut the Model 3 is not just drag strip fast, it also handles well \u2013 with flat cornering and a feeling of being stuck to the road that\u2019s aided by the batteries\u2019 weight creating a low centre of gravity.\n\nGet onto a B road and the Tesla is great fun to hustle along: the low down weight keeps it planted but there\u2019s still a nice shift in the corners, the steering loads up well and has a selection of settings (although as with most modern systems it lacks some feel) and the Model 3 Performance powers out of the bends as if you were shot from a catapult.\n\nThat big deep front windscreen comes into its own here too. Visibility out of the front of the car is superb and really helps in the corners \u2013 something that was especially telling in our left-hand drive version on UK roads.\n\nBut despite all that power, the Model 3 Performance doesn\u2019t feel as focussed as the kings of the modern-day super saloon world. Some might argue that\u2019s a psychological trick from lack of bark from an exhaust, but I felt that there\u2019s just not quite the bite of an Alfa Giulia Quadrifoglio, for example.\n\nNonetheless, consider that this involves comparing the Tesla to the cream of decades of fire-breathing internal combustion engine saloon car development, and you realise how accomplished the Model 3 Performance is.\n\nMost Model 3 buyers won\u2019t go for the Performance version, but it\u2019s likely that beyond lacking quite such blistering pace, its sister all-wheel drive Long Range model will not handle so differently. The low weight of the batteries and good visibility will be there and the overall feel of the steering will probably be the same.\n\nThe big difference for the Standard model will be that it is rear-wheel drive only and I wait with interest to get behind the wheel of one to test out how it handles and compares.\n\nThe Model 3's flat, clear dashboard with a giant screen is a Marmite interior - people either love or hate the completely buttonless look. Modern architects are properly in the first camp\n\nMove over Saab, the architect has a new car: Inside the Model 3\n\nIf the Model 3 looks fairly uncontentious from the outside, its interior is a proper Marmite affair.\n\nCharging a Model 3 For most electric car owners the ideal set-up is a home charging point that can be used for most charging, combined with occasional public charger use on the move. A home charging point requires a garage or driveway and Tesla offers a Wall Connector for \u00a3460, which will need professional fitting. It says: 'Most homes in the UK allow a maximum charge rate of 7.4KW or 19 to 27 miles/hour. This is more than sufficient for overnight charging'. Plugging into a standard home plug socket is possible and will add about 6 to 8 miles of range per hour. The Model 3 has an onboard maximum onboard charger rate of 11KW, which equates to about 40 miles of range added per hour. Tesla's pay-per-use Superchargers at up to 120KW bypass the onboard charger and can charge faster than this. Zap Map's electric car charging calculator puts the cost of Supercharging a Model 3 Performance from 20% to 80% using Tesla's quoted average 24p KWH charge, at \u00a310.80 and says it would take 23 minutes. By comparison, it says for a home charger this would be about \u00a36.30.\n\nTesla has removed everything from the dashboard, to leave a long clean, buttonless space with a massive iPad style screen.\n\nThere\u2019s no instrument panel or speedometer behind the steering wheel, the big screen is for that - and you even have to use the touchscreen to open the glove locker.\n\nTwo stalks and a few buttons on the steering wheel are all you get by the way of controls\n\nIt was always said that there was only one choice of car for an architect in the 1980s: a Saab 900.\n\nSadly, today\u2019s motoring world is deprived of new cars from the Swedish favourite, but one look inside a Model 3 and you\u2019ll see that architects of the world can rest safe in the knowledge that Tesla has their back.\n\nTaking everything away means the dash looks pretty big and empty, but I quite liked its looks. The big screen works well and the technology and interface is very good.\n\nMaps are great, the stereo sounds fantastic and you can go digging into the menus for more information on range, where to charge, how to plan a journey \u2013 and even set up the car\u2019s digital whoopee cushions so that it farts. (Yes, that\u2019s correct this \u00a350,000 performance car has a farting mode).\n\nHowever, I did feel that as clean as it makes the lines inside the car, defaulting everything to the big screen is distracting.\n\nThis is not just a Tesla problem - although it has taken screen operations to the extreme - but one with all modern-day cars. We\u2019re told how dangerous it is to try to drive and use a phone, yet car makers shove increasingly amounts of stuff on to screens.\n\nThere's a decent amount of legroom in the back of the Tesla Model 3 - and enough room to sit someone on the middle seat of the bench\n\nAway from that bold dash, the minimalism continues. A big multiple section cubby holder sits between the two front passengers with a gloss top, backed by a central armrest with more space for stuff.\n\nOur interior came in a natty cream and black two tone, which looked pretty good but probably wouldn\u2019t hold up too well to life with my two children.\n\nOverall, materials-wise everything seemed good quality.\n\nThere\u2019s bags of space in both the front and the rear of the car, with decent leg room for rear passengers. The middle seat in the rear is a bit narrow, but the lack of transmission tunnel delivers room for feet \u2013 and remember this is only a 3 Series-size car.\n\nOverall, the feeling inside is light and airy and comfort levels meet the benchmark of a decent executive car - you walk away after a long journey without feeling that you\u2019ve done one.\n\nThe rear boot is the one most people will use and although the Model 3 is a saloon rather than a more load-friendly hatchback (as the Model S is) it offers plenty of space with little obstruction\n\nNo engine means that there is room in the Model 3 for a front boot, left, which will hold a reasonable amount of stuff. Meanwhile, the rear seats fold down to create a handy load space, right, which swallowed a 29inch wheel mountain bike with only one wheel removed\n\nThanks to having both a rear and front boot (there\u2019s no engine remember) Tesla quotes luggage capacity as 542 litres. That compares to a Jaguar XE\u2019s 410 litres, or BMW\u2019s quoted 480 litres for a 3 Series.\n\nIn reality, you can fit some smaller stuff in the front boot \u2013 and it\u2019s a nice extra to have - but it will be the rear that does the load lugging.\n\nIt swallows lots of stuff and the with the rear seats folding flat, the load area is user-friendly, with no major incursions from trim or metalwork \u2013 I was pleasantly surprised to get my 29inch wheel mountain bike in with only the front wheel taken off.\n\nThe Cars & motoring verdict on the Tesla Model 3\n\nThe Model 3 is the car that is considered vital for Tesla\u2019s success and it\u2019s a model that can really change the game in the modern day car world.\n\nTesla Model 3 Performance Price: \u00a349,140 (standard car \u00a336,490) Power source: Electric - 75kWh battery Power: 444bhp, dual motor, all wheel drive 0 - 60mph: 3.2 seconds Top speed: 162mph Range: 329 miles (WLTP) Weight: 1,847kg Length: 4.69 metres Width: 2.08 metres Warranty: 4 years / 50,000 miles Battery warranty: 8 years / 100,000 miles\n\nThe Model S and Model X are great cars; I\u2019ve spent a week with the former, including a drive to Wales and back, and a weekend with the latter, and was impressed by both.\n\nHowever, they are expensive and for the few not the many.\n\nIn the UK, a Model S currently starts at \u00a377,200 and a Model X at \u00a382,200, so you will need deep pockets to buy one.\n\nThe Model 3 is a car that more mainstream buyers can purchase and the recent price drop means the Standard Range Plus car at \u00a336,490 could be yours for under \u00a3300 a month over 36 months on a PCP finance deal, with a \u00a310,000 deposit put down\n\nIts range of 254 miles should be adequate for many and it will be as fast as they need it to be.\n\nGet a home charging point and as a family car it will be practical, comfortable, fun to drive, cheap to run and you\u2019ll be doing your bit to help the planet by not driving an internal combustion engine car. (You\u2019ll need to ignore the environmental cost of building new cars and batteries though.)\n\nThe real crunch test for Tesla\u2019s success in the UK, once it finally starts getting Model 3 right hand drive deliveries out to all those patiently waiting for them, will be the quality of those cars and their reliability.\n\nThe Model 3 Performance is lightning quick but doesn't have the same focussed feel behind the wheel or the aggressive styling that a BMW M3 or Alfa Giulia Quadrifoglio has\n\nChances are if you do decide to buy a Model 3 that you\u2019ll spend some time eyeing up the dual motor all-wheel drive Long Range or Performance models.\n\nThe question is are they worth the extra money over the Standard Range Plus car?\n\nIf you really need the extra range, the Long Range one also offers a bit of extra speed, but if I were to buy a Model 3 and spend the cash on picking a pricier model I\u2019d go for the Performance version we tested.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u00a349,140 car though - so creeping up into big money territory - and while that might be \u00a310,000 cheaper than a BMW M3, the Tesla isn\u2019t quite the performance king the German legend is.\n\nNonetheless, the Tesla Model 3 Performance is a seriously good car and testimony to what can be achieved with an electric vehicle.", "description": "The first of the right-hand drive Model 3s are making their way to UK buyers, Simon Lambert got a sneak preview of what they'll get by testing a Model 3 Performance for a weekend.", "authors": ["Simon Lambert For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
