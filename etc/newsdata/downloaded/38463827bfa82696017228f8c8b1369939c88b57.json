Are you having a laugh mate?'\n\nMichelin-starred chefs Claude Bosi and Lisa Goodwin-Allen were set the challenging of recreating Burger King's Whopper burger in last night's episode of channel 4's Snackmasters\n\nWhile viewers criticised winner Lisa for preparing her replica without wearing gloves, Claude was condemned for licking his fingers before handling the food in his practice run\n\nPicking up on the chef's lack of hygiene on the show, one viewer penned: 'The unique taste of a whopper must come from the staff not wearing gloves' (pictured)\n\nA third added: 'Did I just see that chef licking his fingers there?' while a fourth similarly asked: 'Did he just lick his fingers?'\n\nIn the show, which challenges top chefs to recreate some of Britain's best-loved snacks, presenter Fred Sirieix set the pair an additional challenge - to go head-to-head in a Burger King restaurant to deliver their burgers in the fastest possible time.\n\nAs the challenge got underway, Lisa began by individually dissecting every element of the meal with her team - and quickly realised the task wasn't as straight forward as it first seemed.\n\n'The interesting thing is the bun as it has a sweetness to it,' she noted. 'It's so incredibly light, everything is so even.'\n\nLisa (pictured) was declared the winner of the challenge - despite her chips being too overcooked and salty\n\nMany asked the same question when it came to Lisa's time to shine: 'Why is the Burger King woman not wearing gloves when she prepares a whopper?'\n\nDespite the chefs being under tremendous pressure, many viewers were left shocked by the hygiene standards one the show (pictured)\n\nHowever, it wasn't long before she too came under fire from eagle-eyed viewers, who noted she wasn't wearing gloves.\n\n'Why aren't they wearing gloves when making food in Burger King? ugh,' criticised one, while another penned: 'She didn\u2019t have gloves on. Eww.'\n\n'Why is the Burger King woman not wearing gloves when she prepares a whopper?' wrote a third, while a fourth added: 'The unique taste of a whopper must come from the staff not wearing gloves.'\n\nAnother commented: 'Should she not be using tongs or gloves or something...?'\n\nDespite the criticism, Lisa was declared the winner by a panel of the fast-food chain's employees - despite overcooking her chips.\n\n'We've got a good visual,' wrote one. 'But the chips are really salty. If I was in a restaurant I'd send these back for being too greasy. The meat patty is not bad but the bun is too sugary.'\n\nOthers who tuned in took to social media to praise the amusing concept of the show, while others were simply left craving a burger.\n\n'It\u2019s hilarious to see Michelin starred chefs sweating and panicking over a Burger King Whopper,' penned one, while a second wrote: 'Just the best programme ever.'\n\nAnother commented: 'I'm in need of a Whopper now,' while a further added: 'Thanks. #burgerking. now!!! I'm starving!'\n\nThe judging panel was made up of the fast-food chain's employees, who offered their expertise on the subject (pictured)", "description": "Michelin-starred chefs Claude Bosi and Lisa Goodwin-Allen competed against each other to recreate Burger King's Whopper in last night's episode of the channel 4 show, Snackmasters.", "authors": ["Chloe Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/09/19778206-0-image-a-25_1571214591813.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
