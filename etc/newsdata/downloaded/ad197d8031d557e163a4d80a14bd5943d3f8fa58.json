The number of US podcast consumers has more than doubled over the last decade. And by 2023, Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be some 106 million regular podcast listeners in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nPeople are getting hooked on audio from a young age, too. Over a quarter (26%) of US consumers over age 12 now listen to podcasts on a monthly basis, a jump from just 12% five years ago.\n\nAnd while the growing listener base is a huge draw for advertisers, it's not the real reason they should be exploring podcast campaigns. After all, more than half of overall daily media consumption time in the US is now spent with video. Even so, podcasts have the upper hand.\n\nWhy should brands advertise on podcasts?\n\nUS podcast ad spend is expected to grow over 110% through 2020 \u2014 up to $659 million. But consider for a moment that TV and radio ad spend are already at $69 billion and $18 billion respectively, and this figure suddenly feels tiny. The podcast ad market's small size implies many brands don't recognize the valuable advertising opportunity podcasts offer.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nWhen looking at factors beyond pure audience size, podcast listeners present several key benefits that make the medium ripe for success for advertising \u2014 and brands would be remiss to overlook them.\n\nHere's why brands should take podcast listeners seriously:\n\nThe majority of regular podcast listeners complete all or most of the podcasts they start. Forty-four percent of monthly podcast listeners finish most of the podcast episodes they start, while 43% finish the entire episode, per Edison Research and Triton Digital.\n\nForty-four percent of monthly podcast listeners finish most of the podcast episodes they start, while 43% finish the entire episode, per Edison Research and Triton Digital.
