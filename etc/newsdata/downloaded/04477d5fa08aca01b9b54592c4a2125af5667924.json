The department also said it plans to charge suspects Patrick Stallworth, 39, and Derick Irisha Brown, 29, with capital murder and kidnapping in connection to the case.\n\nThe suspects were arrested last week on unrelated charges and were named persons of interests in Kamille's disappearance. Stallworth was arrested on child porn charges and Brown was jailed for violating probation conditions on a previous kidnapping charge.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this was something they thought about and acted upon and they saw an opportunity to take a young child, and they did,\u201d Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith told reporters Tuesday. \"I would like to thank the public for all of the information, all of the tips, all of the video and for their cooperation with this police department during the course of this investigation.\"\n\nAlabama Law Enforcement Agency\n\nKamille was abducted near a Birmingham housing area on Oct. 12. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said investigators are not aware of any connections between the suspects and the victim's family.\n\n\u201cTonight our entire city is in mourning. Kamille is gone,\" Woodfin said Tuesday. \"At this moment that we're standing in, I ask one thing of this community: not to take sides and not to finger point. But if there is any finger pointing to do it is only at the perpetrator, who would kidnap an innocent 3-year-old.\"\n\nPolice on Friday released surveillance footage from the night Kamille was abducted. In the video, two children, one of whom is believed to Kamille, are seen playing outside.\n\nTonight, we're a city in mourning.\n\n\n\nKamille Mckinney is gone. Ripped away from her family. The pain her family is enduring right now is unimaginable.\n\n\n\nKnow that whomever perpetrated this crime will be brought to justice and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. \u2014 Randall Woodfin (@randallwoodfin) October 23, 2019\n\nOne of the men in the video, who apparently \"engages the children,\" is a suspect, Smith said previously.\n\n\"The first man who walked by in the video, he may have pertinent information that will help us,\" Smith said last week. \"This is the male we're looking for ... we want to talk to him ... if he saw something that night that may be critical to the investigation.\"\n\nPolice do not yet know a motive for the abduction.\n\nBirmingham Police Department via Twitter\n\nA $28,000 reward had been offered to find the little girl.\n\n\"If you have her and you're not sure what to do \u2026 please bring her to one of our fire stations, police station, a hospital,\" Smith said at an earlier press conference. \"If you don't know what to do or where to go and you're frightened, we're here to help you ... please bring her to a safe location.\"\n\nABC News' Darren Reynolds contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
