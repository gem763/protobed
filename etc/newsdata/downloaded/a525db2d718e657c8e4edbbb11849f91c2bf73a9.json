Notable brands already under the Inspire umbrella include Sonic, Arby's and Buffalo Wild Wings.\n\nThe purchase of Jimmy John\u2019s adds to the already impressive reach of Inspire, which is very quietly building a food brand that is touching upon several levels of the restaurant industry including fast food and dine-in options. Jimmy John\u2019s is known for its sandwiches as well as its delivery service which is kept in-house and does not utilize a third party.\n\nAaron Allen, the founder of Aaron Allen & Associates, a leading consulting firm in the restaurant industry, said that this move works well with Inspire's recent acquisitions and also gives the brand more of a chance to expand internationally.\n\n\"It continues to add to their acquisition strategy, which they've been successfully executing,\" Aaron Allen told FOX Business. \"It's a big buy, it's a big win. It's kind of big game trophy hunting, and they pulled down a large trophy in this one.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 1983 by Jimmy John Liautaud, the Illinois-based restaurant chain boasted 2,748 franchises throughout the country as of last year. The deal is expected to be completed in October.\n\n\"This is the big getting bigger in a level that is pretty unprecedented in modern food service,\" Allen said.\n\nMORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Inspire Brands made a big move on Wednesday, purchasing Jimmy John's for a $14 billion deal.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Jimmy-Johns-iStock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
