It is also full of echoes of other young adult stories of its ilk. Percy and his young friends seem like other young people in fantastical stories, most obviously Harry, Hermione, and Ron from Harry Potter.\n\nIf you or your kids enjoy the Percy Jackson series, perhaps this will not be a completely wasted couple of hours. Equally you won\u2019t be missing much if you decide to forgo this particular piece of brand extension. You may go, and smile with a few bits of \u201cooo-yes\u201d recognition, but you won\u2019t leave Broadway\u2019s Longacre Theatre\u2014where the show opened Wednesday night, to Jan. 5\u2014with your synapses set to thrilled mode.\n\nPercy Jackson suffers in Broadway comparison to the visual theatrics of Harry Potter and The Cursed Child and the zany fun and rich canvas of SpongeBob Squarepants.\n\nThe story ambles along, with all its shocking bits not that shocking\u2014even its vengeful wraiths are disappointing because you have seen similar puppetry in War Horse, and other shows subsequent to it.\n\nPercy (Chris McCarrell) himself is yet another generically good-looking white teenager, who sings songs about feeling different. Possible contributing factors to this\u2014that he suffers from ADHD and dyslexia\u2014are mentioned, and then never mentioned again\u2014and don\u2019t visibly influence anything on stage.\n\nPercy on stage, honestly, seems like a pretty regular, good kid. He rarely disobeys anyone, is kind and solicitous, and always does the right thing and acts heroically without any pause. The story keeps bringing up how hard his life has been and how different he is, but he doesn\u2019t seem that different.\n\nEventually, Percy announces to us that he is now officially on a quest, and off he, Annabeth (Kristin Stokes) and Grover (Jorrel Javier) go to try and find Zeus' stolen lightning bolt, and thereby prevent war breaking out between the Greek gods.\n\nThere are all kinds of other things happening on the side of the main drama that could be elaborated on, or followed through on\u2014Percy\u2019s appalling stepfather, the supposed death of his mother Sally (Jalynn Steele). Stokes sings a ballad, \u201cMy Grand Plan,\u201d which feels listless and pamphlet-y, in praise of her own empowerment.\n\nLike the other kids at Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for kids of demigods like Percy overseen by the shouty Chiron (Ryan Knowles), Percy is struggling with fairly yawnsome things: what to do when you\u2019re the kid of a god, and how to use some pretty intense superpowers. There\u2019s a lot of talk about what it\u2019s like if your dad is Poseidon, and not much conflict.\n\nWhen father and son eventually see each other, it\u2019s...totally fine. The musical is a succession of promised thrills and damp squibs, although the streaks of lighting from ceiling to stage are a lovely way to convey roads.\n\n\u201c The monsters don\u2019t seem that scary, and Percy never seems that in danger. The quest feels more like a chaotic video-game, with each fight set-piece a grating, fake-looking scramble \u201d\n\nPercy Jackson progresses very politely and predictably. For all its praise of difference, it is itself entirely by rote. It\u2019s always nice when children are well-behaved in theaters, but then you think about them sitting there so quietly during something like Percy Jackson, and you think as I did at the performance I attended: Hang on, they should be a little more vocal.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the musical is bad when it comes to moral lessons\u2014and it\u2019s especially good to see boys and girls being friends as a narrative end in itself, rather than involved in romance. But the monsters don\u2019t seem that scary, and Percy never seems that in danger. The quest feels more like a chaotic video-game, with each set-piece fight a grating scramble.\n\nThere are a few breakout moments, such as a great visual effect that happens near the end, Charon's song as the kids descend to the underworld, and also when the final song, \u201cBring on the Monsters,\u201d posits the challenge to its young and old audience that we should all be brave to face the monsters and demons running amok in our real world.\n\nThis is a bracing call to social and civic responsibility. But it\u2019s missing from the main body of this aimless musical, which seems more concerned with box-ticking than originality.", "description": "If you loved the books and movies, \u2018The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical\u2019 on Broadway\u2014with its lack of magic and creaking plot\u2014is not a must-see piece of brand extension.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571257408/191016-teeman-lightning-thief-tease_cxdite", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
