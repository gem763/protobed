But it\u2019s one that\u2019s aimed squarely at the one percent. Fleck\u2019s murder of three investment bankers becomes a flashpoint, pitting Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) \u2014 a billionaire pol and would-be mayor who simply wants to make Gotham great again in the face of decline, corruption, and violence \u2014 against a group of masked bandits wielding \u201cRESIST\u201d signs and whinging about fascism.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, \u201cJoker\u201d is one of the more fascinating documents of our time: Warner Brothers has spent $60 million making, and God only knows how much marketing, a movie in which Antifa kills Thomas Wayne and, we presume, creates the Batman. It\u2019s no wonder the provocateurs at Venice rewarded the film and its director, Todd Phillips, with the Golden Lion, while the stiffs at TIFF sniffed.\n\nPhillips\u2019s and Phoenix\u2019s Joker is not a mastermind so much as a symbol. He has no minions, exactly, but the streets by film\u2019s end are filled with those whom he has inspired with his acts of vicious retribution, including the assassination of a talk show host live on the air. Phoenix portrays the Joker as an agent of chaos \u2014 alternately dancing with nimble grace and running from cops with a sort of slapstick shamble; laughing uncontrollably as a rictus of sadness animates his face \u2014 and as such, he\u2019s no architect of destruction. Rather, he\u2019s simply a flashpoint.\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s a shot toward the end of \u201cJoker\u201d that echoes a previous iteration of the character: his head against a cop car window, staring out, he sees the chaos he has caused and begins to smile. One can\u2019t help but think of Heath Ledger\u2019s head out the window of a cop car, taking the wind in his hair like a dog whose owner has let him up in the front seat. But the differences between the two characters are vast. Whereas Ledger\u2019s Joker claimed to be an agent of chaos all while setting up infinitely intricate plans and plots, Phoenix\u2019s Joker is that chaos.\n\nAD\n\nIf Phillips is a director whose main concern is cruelty \u2014 and I say that as someone who enjoys the comedy of cruelty and crudity that Phillips has cultivated \u2014 Christopher Nolan is a director whose main concern is identity. And in \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d he uses the Joker as a means of getting at the identity of Gotham\u2019s citizenry: is it, at heart, vicious and base, and thus beyond redemption by a masked vigilante? Or good and noble, and thus worthy of said masked hero absorbing the sins of the city?\n\nThe answer by the end of \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d is \u201cgood enough, for now.\u201d Nolan\u2019s movies in general come across as extremely skeptical of Gotham\u2019s public. In \u201cBatman Begins\u201d the masses are literally weaponized and turned against each other via the Scarecrow\u2019s (Cillian Murphy) fear-inducing chemicals. In \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d we see they need little encouragement from Bane (Tom Hardy) to start ransacking the homes of the wealthy. And even in \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d we see them try to kill a whistleblower at the Joker\u2019s behest, but by film\u2019s end they refuse to cross the line into outright mass murder. One cheer for Gotham, I suppose.\n\nAD\n\nBut it\u2019s Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cBatman\u201d that comes closest to understanding group psychology. There\u2019s a funny moment when the Joker (Jack Nicholson), who has hijacked a press conference about Gotham\u2019s cancellation of the town\u2019s bicentennial parade, finally gets everyone\u2019s attention. We\u2019ve seen a cross-section of Gothamites \u2014 blue collar workers, punkish bikers, lowlifes in a bar \u2014 studiously ignore their TVs despite the strange things transpiring on it. Until, that is, the Joker says he\u2019s going to be distributing $20 million, cash, to anyone who shows up. This piques their interest! This earns their attention. This gains him admiration.\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, this has always been and may always be the most compelling iteration of the Joker. Incels, Antifa, agents of chaos: that\u2019s all interesting and timely, but temporary. The simple fact of the matter is that few of us are looking for a symbol. We just want a guy who will slap on some makeup, tell us what we want to hear, and throw some money our way.\n\nAD", "description": "Worries that \u201cJoker\u201d \u2014 the new movie from Warner Brothers documenting one possible origin of Batman\u2019s nemesis, the Clown Prince of Crime \u2014 would spark violence from disaffected young men in the \u201cincel\u201d community, were remarkably overblown. There was no violence and the film broke box office records. More importantly, though, the Joker isn\u2019t an inspiration for incels at all. Rather, he\u2019s the forefather of Antifa.", "authors": ["Sonny Bunch"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/T2G5fa39SCBwy70RdTYAWHGoAjY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XKIYRHHF6QI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
