(AP) - For the most part, Duane Brown\u2019s social media activity is pretty restrained.\n\nHe\u2019s usually only on Twitter every few days unless there\u2019s something significant on his mind.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was noteworthy last Friday night when the Seahawks\u2019 big left tackle posted one tweet that sent fans into a tizzy. They were left trying to decipher what a set of six giant eyeball emojis was supposed to mean with rumors swirling about one of Brown\u2019s former teammates.\n\n\u201cIt was a little premature. I didn\u2019t think as many people would look into it as they did. But man, was I wrong,\u201d Brown said Wednesday. \u201cI think I caused a lot of people to lose some sleep that night and I\u2019m sorry. I decided to have a little fun and obviously everyone was trying to see what was going on. People started calling my phone at like 4 a.m. I didn\u2019t give them anything, but yeah, that was a good time.\u201d\n\nWhat Brown was having fun with was the eventual arrival in Seattle of Jadeveon Clowney in a significant and unexpected trade Saturday that gave the Seahawks the pass rusher they needed.\n\nWhile Clowney held leverage in determining where he ended up, Brown deserved at least a slight assist for steering Clowney toward Seattle.\n\nThe former teammates in Houston chatted throughout the offseason after the Texans placed the franchise tag on Clowney, who was unhappy with his contract. Brown had gone through a similar contract dispute with the Texans and was a trusted resource for Clowney.\n\nBut about a month ago Clowney unexpectedly reached out and Brown noticed the tone of the conversation changed slightly.\n\n\u201cHe just started asking questions about it, about the team, and I just told him the truth,\u201d Brown recalled. \u201cTold him how I felt here, my experience here, about the culture, about the staff, about the team, about the locker room and from there he just said, \u2018That sounds like somewhere I would love to be.\u2019 I was like, \u2018You would love it.\u2019\u201d\n\nEventually, Brown became a sounding board for both Clowney and the Seahawks. He provided information about the team to his friend, and gave the Seahawks his opinion of what they would be getting if the deal went through.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to the respect that I have for Duane,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cHe is a great worker, he has extraordinary habits, his personal expectations for what it takes, he\u2019s a really good communicator. Ever since he\u2019s showed up, he\u2019s been a big factor in everything he\u2019s done. He\u2019s a special guy delivering the message in what we may be getting. I give him a lot of regard there.\u201d\n\nAfter facing Clowney in practice for three-plus seasons, Brown knows what Clowney can provide on the field if he remains healthy. After struggling with injury early in his career, Clowney has missed only one game in the past two seasons and has a combined 18 \u00bd sacks over that stretch.\n\nBrown believes an unjustified stigma has been placed on Clowney\u2019s ability to stay healthy and his effort level.\n\n\u201cThe narrative that I think a lot of people created for him throughout his career I think is false and not fair to him,\u201d Brown said. \u201cExtremely hard worker, fun guy to be around, wants to win and I think those are the factors that really stand out about him. Played out perfectly, we were able to get him and I\u2019m pretty excited about it.\u201d\n\nNOTES: WR DK Metcalf (knee) and DE L.J. Collier (ankle) were limited participants in practice Wednesday. Carroll has sounded optimistic both could end up playing Sunday. \u2026 G Mike Iupati (calf) participated in a walkthrough Wednesday but did not practice in the afternoon. If Iupati can\u2019t play Ethan Pocic would get the start.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "For the most part, Duane Brown's social media activity is pretty restrained.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/new_look_texans_football_84282_c0-190-2324-1545_s1770x1032.jpg?a2767b2d052f1cad91fbef665cd5437e31c23097"}
