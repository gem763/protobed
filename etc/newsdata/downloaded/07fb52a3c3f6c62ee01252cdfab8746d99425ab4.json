I might return the favour and kill you.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s comments sparked a large amount of backlash online, with pro-choice advocates blasting him and describing them as \u2018horrific\u2019.\n\nThe 24-year-old, speaking in a YouTube video on his channel, has responded in an attempt to clarify his comments.\n\n\u201cThe circumstance I\u2019m about to describe is one of the most interesting phenomenons I\u2019ve ever seen online.\n\n\u201cI was very harsh in what appeared to be my condemnation of JJ\u2019s choice to have five abortions.\n\n\u201cI said something distasteful and insensitive, I think I said something like \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you bro and end you the way you did to the babies\u2019. In fact, it left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n\u201cMy rebuttal for that would be that in the context for a fight where you have two guys who are literally trying to kill each other in a ring, this fell into the category of \u2018fight talk\u2019, which can get pretty toxic. This definitely comes into that category.\n\n\u201cThis went semi-viral on Twitter, it might be an attempt to cancel me again and I oddly enough understood it because I said it in a chauvinistic, hasty way because I was triggered and I hit the red button.\n\n\u201cThe point I tried to make, as a pro-choice guy I\u2019m wondering at what point does JJ\u2019s blatantly irresponsible sexual life cross the line, because he\u2019s using abortion as a means of contraception.\u201d", "description": "Logan Paul has moved to clarify\u00a0comments which he made at a UK press conference whilst promoting his fight against KSI.
