Being late is never ideal, but it\u2019s particularly embarrassing because I\u2019m meeting Eyal to discuss his new book, Indistractable: How To Control Your Attention And Choose Your Life, a guide to staying focused in an age of constant distraction. The hope is that he will teach me, a chronic procrastinator, how to stop wasting my life scrolling through my phone, and finally write that novel. Or, at the very least, be on time for appointments.\n\nDressed in Tech Dad chic \u2013 a crisp button-down shirt and jeans \u2013 Eyal already has coffee and looks busy when I burst in. He dropped his daughter off at science camp this morning, he explains, which is why he picked this spot; he hopes it wasn\u2019t inconvenient. And I shouldn\u2019t worry about being late: \u201cMaybe you can use it in your article, as your introduction.\u201d Obviously, I will have time to think of a better introduction, but I thank him anyway.\n\nUntil recently, Eyal was what MIT Technology Review called \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s most visible advocate of habit-forming technology\u201d. His first book, Hooked: How To Build Habit Forming Products (2013), became a must-read in advertising and tech circles. Eyal has spent the years since helping companies \u2013 from small workout apps such as Fitbod, to Microsoft and PayPal \u2013 manipulate user behaviour. The \u201chook model\u201d he developed advocates building a \u201cmind monopoly\u201d by associating a product with internal emotional triggers, such as loneliness or a fear of missing out. The developer\u2019s goal is that people are triggered to use the product \u201cwith little conscious thought\u201d. Now that we\u2019re all addicted to our devices, he is bringing out a book that will help us get unhooked.\n\nEyal gets a little defensive when I offer up this analysis. Hooked, he stresses, was about building positive habits; it urged companies to improve people\u2019s lives. He even developed what he called a \u201cmanipulation matrix\u201d, a flow-chart that would let companies see if they were using the Hooked model in an ethical way. Further, he says, we need to stop using the word \u201caddicted\u201d when it comes to technology \u2013 because most of us aren\u2019t addicted at all; we\u2019re just guilty of overuse. \u201cAddiction, in people\u2019s minds, means mind control,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you tell yourself, this is addicting me, this is hijacking my brain\u2026 you slough off responsibility. It\u2019s called learned helplessness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of scare-mongering around technology at the moment, he adds, \u201cparticularly from people who want to sell clicks and thrive on the economics of fear\u201d. But the more mundane truth, he says, is that there is \u201cno mind control\u201d. Our brains aren\u2019t being hijacked.\n\n\u201cHijacking is what happened on 9/11,\u201d Eyal scoffs. \u201cIt\u2019s not Facebook \u2013 give me a break.\u201d It\u2019s amazing, he adds, that people don\u2019t see that the alarm around tech is just a repeat of a very old storyline. \u201cIn the 1950s, fearmongers were saying the exact same thing about comic books, literally verbatim: it\u2019s reducing kids\u2019 attention spans; it\u2019s causing them to commit suicide; it\u2019s leading to mental health issues.\u201d Distraction, he stresses, is an age-old problem that is far bigger than technology. He cites a 2014 study led by professors at the University of Virginia and published in the journal Science: when left alone in a room containing nothing but an electric shock device, 67% of men and 25% of women gave themselves painful electric shocks to pass the time. We go to great lengths to avoid sitting alone with our thoughts or dealing with internal discomfort. If we want to avoid distraction, we can\u2019t just throw our phones away or go on a digital detox; we need to deal with the psychological reasons we\u2019re looking for distraction in the first place.\n\nAnd this, really, is the central thesis of Indistractible: stop blaming technology for your personal failings and start blaming yourself. Fair enough, but isn\u2019t this letting today\u2019s tech companies shirk responsibility? The constant urge many of us to have to check our phones is very much by design. Can we really compare today\u2019s technology, which touches every aspect of our lives, to comic books and TV?\n\nLook, Eyal says, the fact we\u2019re all carrying smartphones means that \u201cdistraction is easier than ever to find\u201d. But he stresses that \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re powerless \u2013 it means we need a new skill set.\u201d His book contains lots of tactical tips for dealing with external triggers such as smartphone notifications; but, most importantly, he thinks, it addresses the psychological \u201cinternal triggers\u201d that tech companies are exploiting. \u201cThe big life lesson here is to look for root causes,\u201d Eyal says. \u201cYou need to aim to spend a little time with your feelings.\u201d\n\nEverything, from when I start work to walking the dog, is mapped out. I allocate two minutes for a pat on the back\n\nI promise Eyal that as soon as I leave our meeting I\u2019m going to spend time with my feelings. In the meantime, what\u2019s the quickest thing I can do to stop being distracted? \u201cTimeboxing,\u201d Eyal says. Instead of relying on to-do lists, I should complete an exercise that involves planning out every minute of my week. And by that, I mean every minute: from what time you start eating breakfast to how long you have to socialise with your significant other in the evening. \u201cYou have no right to call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from,\u201d is Eyal\u2019s mantra.\n\nTimeboxing could even be the answer to gender equality. Eyal says he spent years fighting with his wife about domestic responsibility. He always thought he pulled his weight, until they both did a timeboxing exercise and he realised that \u201clike most women in heterosexual relationships, she was doing more household admin than I was\u201d.\n\nThere are various timeboxing apps and templates out there (including Clockify and FocusList) but I start by using Google calendar to schedule a week full of tasks. Everything, from what time I start writing to when I walk the dog, is neatly mapped out. I allocate two minutes to give myself a pat on the back: finally, I am leaving my procrastinating ways behind. But that\u2019s enough work for today; I\u2019ll get to the really hard stuff tomorrow.\n\nThe new me gets off to a fairly good start. I sit down to work \u2013 on schedule \u2013 at 9am sharp, and start writing. About 20 minutes in, I get a strong urge to get up and make tea. Eyal has prepared me for this: the first thing to do when distraction hits, he says, is to figure out what\u2019s causing it. \u201cThere are only three reasons for a distraction,\u201d he adds. \u201cAn internal trigger, an external trigger or a planning problem.\u201d\n\nHonestly, my need for another cup of tea is probably the sign of caffeine addiction; but for the purposes of this exercise I classify it as an \u201cinternal trigger\u201d. According to Eyal, the first thing to do when you have an intrusive thought is to focus on the emotion that precedes it and write it down. I dutifully write: \u201cUgh, I can\u2019t be bothered.\u201d The next step is to spend 10 minutes \u201csurfing the urge\u201d to give in to your distraction, and to figure out why you feel like this. If you still want to give in at the end, then you should just do it. There\u2019s no point, Eyal says, in being \u201cmilitantly abstinent\u201d. This is not a problem I\u2019ve ever suffered from.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Email, Eyal says, is the \u2018mother of all habit-forming products\u2019. Photograph: Christopher Lane/The Guardian\n\nWhen Eyal first told me to \u201csurf the urge\u201d, I scoffed. It sounded extremely Californian and a complete waste of time. However, it is a technique psychologists use to help patients with addiction, and has some scientific backing; one study found that smokers who tried it reduced the number of cigarettes consumed. Paradoxical as it may seem, zooming in on your internal discomfort can actually make it go away. My own experiment certainly reduced my personal tea consumption for the day; more importantly, it reminded me that I don\u2019t need to give in to every impulse. I hate to sound like a deodorant advert, but it was sort of empowering.\n\nAt 10am, a calendar notification pops up. I\u2019ve scheduled 10 minutes to check my email. Eyal calls email the \u201cmother of all habit-forming products\u201d, one of several technologies he refers to in the book as \u201cslot machines\u201d. The uncertainty of what\u2019s in our inbox means we\u2019re constantly checking it, but most email is a complete waste of time. According to a study Eyal cites, by management consultants Bain & Co, 25% of our time spent on email is consumed with reading things that shouldn\u2019t have been sent, and 25% is spent responding to things that don\u2019t need to be answered. Eyal advises checking your messages only at specific times and labelling incoming emails \u201creply today\u201d or \u201creply this week\u201d. This, he says, has cut down the time he spends on email by 90%. I am hopeful that it will do the same for me, but it takes me for ever to figure out how to label my emails and I am interrupted in the middle by a calendar notification telling me it\u2019s time to eat the leftovers in the fridge. Obviously, I must stick to my schedule, so email organisation will have to wait.\n\nMost of us have times in our day when we\u2019re more likely to slack off, and so need some extra motivation. Eyal recommends using \u201cpre-commitments\u201d to make this sort of unwanted behaviour more difficult. This might mean using an app to prevent you accessing certain websites at specified times, or scheduling focused work sessions with friends or colleagues. If you work from home, there is also a tool called Focusmate (in which Eyal has invested) where you spend 50 minutes virtually co-working with a stranger, keeping an eye on each other via your webcams.\n\nIn order to avoid my usual afternoon slump, I sign up for a 3pm session and am matched with a regular Focusmate user called Isabelle. At the beginning of the session we tell each other our goals \u2013 she\u2019s working on copy for her website \u2013 and then we get on with it. Having a stranger watch you work sounds deeply weird, but you quickly get over that, and it does make you feel more accountable. I even found myself sitting up straighter; I didn\u2019t want Isabelle to think that I slouched.\n\nThe route to a healthier relationship with technology isn\u2019t necessarily going cold turkey; it\u2019s learning moderation\n\nI spend the next couple of weeks trying out every one of Eyal\u2019s tips. I make myself a \u201cconcentration crown\u201d so that my girlfriend knows when I\u2019m focusing and won\u2019t talk to me. (She talks to me anyway and the crown makes me feel stupid.) I \u201chack back\u201d my iPhone by adjusting my notification settings, reducing \u201cexternal triggers\u201d from apps. (This is super easy and makes a big difference.) I keep on surfing my urges.\n\nA month later, I have a follow-up call with Eyal to discuss my progress \u2013 or lack of it. I regretfully inform him that the thing I have struggled with most is timeboxing. Things kept coming up that would throw my schedule off, and I\u2019d get frustrated and give up. Eyal tells me to be persistent and build buffers into my schedule. Most of all, I shouldn\u2019t make excuses: \u201cWe can find reasons why timeboxing doesn\u2019t work even when it does.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m being told off by the headmaster. However, Eyal is persuasive and I think I\u2019ve reached a happy medium; not every minute of my day is planned out, but I\u2019ve got better at scheduling tasks rather than making vague to-do lists.\n\nSo what\u2019s the verdict: have I become more focused? I filed this article very late, which probably answers that question. But there\u2019s no denying that Eyal\u2019s book is a refreshing antidote to the advice that we should all be buying flip phones and digital detoxing. The route to a healthier relationship with technology isn\u2019t necessarily going cold turkey; it\u2019s learning moderation and good habits.\n\nDoes Eyal place responsibility too squarely on the individual? There must be some middle ground. While we can\u2019t blame tech companies for everything, we must keep holding them to account for the ways in which they are getting us hooked. Silicon Valley will not change its behaviour by itself. Learning new skills to avoid digital distraction is all very well \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t distract us from the bigger problem.\n\n\u2022 Nir Eyal is delivering a Guardian Masterclass on how to focus in an age of distraction, on 15 October, at the Guardian, Kings Place, London N1.
