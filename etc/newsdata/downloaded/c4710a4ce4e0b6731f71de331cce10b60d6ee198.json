The mountain range, which rests over a number of European countries, including Switzerland, has been impacted in recent decades by climate change\n\nThe mighty eagle can be seen swooping as it approaches the summit of a mountain in the Alpine region. Victor tends to soar and plummet during the video\n\nHere Victor can be seen approaching a huge expanse of snow. The images were provided by a charity called the Eagle Wings Foundation\n\nThe footage begins with Victor perched in the foreground and a view of the mountains behind him.\n\nThe feathered director is kitted out with a camera, no bigger than a coffee coaster.\n\nThe images were provided courtesy of a charity working with children in Mexico, called the Eagle Wings Foundation.\n\nReports say that the mountain range in the Alpine regions are changing very often over recent years and has dramatically changed in decades. Many wonder whether their children will have the opportunity to see the same mountain tops\n\nVictor can be seen with the camera set up between his wings as he peers over the Alpine mountain tops\n\nThe soaring bird can then be seen hovering over the mountain tops and swooping down and in between the majestic peaks.\n\nVictor flies over a series of large compounds built on the top of the summits. It appears as though much of the powdery snow has receded from nearby to the buildings and from around the peaks.\n\nAs the astonishing video draws to an end, Victor plummets through a mist of snowy fog and can then be seen thundering towards the arm of a man who was waiting for the bird's return.\n\nThe feathered director approaches a number of large compounds perched on the mountain tops. It appears as though much of the snow has receded from where the buildings stand\n\nClimate change is affecting the Alps from the composition of the frost holding the mountains in place, to the volume and quality of snow\n\nGlaciers are retreating and ice and snow bridges are disappearing. The art of guiding in the mountains is changing as traditional routes become unsafe. Here, Victor can be seen returning to his handler who is waiting nearby to the lake in the shot", "description": "Victor the white-tailed eagle caught this breathtaking footage, revealing an eagle-eye view of the snow-topped glaciers of the Alps and the damage inflicted on them by climate change.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/09/19327188-0-image-a-18_1570264819147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
