Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, turned up the heat Sunday on the NBA, calling it \u201creally sad\u201d to see the league pressured by China to engage in censorship \u201cin the interest of big bucks.\u201d\n\nA \u201cdiehard Houston Rockets fan,\u201d Mr. Cruz said China\u2019s reaction to Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet last week in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong shows \u201cjust how powerful the protests are.\u201d\n\n\u201c[H]e tweeted a very benign tweet where he said, stand for freedom, stand with Hong Kong. And the Chinese communist government, they just about lost it,\u201d Mr. Cruz said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in an interview from Hong Kong.\n\nThe NBA has sought to repair relations with China after the government-controlled Chinese broadcaster announced a boycott of Rockets games while Chinese commercial sponsors cancelled their deals with the team.\n\n\u201cAnd sadly, what ended up happening is the NBA as a league began this series of apologies,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cAnd it was really sad to see an American company and indeed a global sports league like the NBA being dragooned into censoring the free speech of American citizens in the interest of big bucks. It\u2019s not complicated why the NBA did that.\u201d\n\n.@SenTedCruz on @NBA bending to Chinese censorship of Hong Kong protests:\n\n\u201cIt was really sad to see an American company and indeed a global sports league like the NBA being dragooned into censoring the free speech of American citizens in the interest of big bucks.\u201d pic.twitter.com/Mqwq8e1Mae \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 13, 2019\n\nMr. Cruz, who wore all black in a show of solidarity with the protesters, added that \u201cwhat\u2019s happening here in Hong Kong is inspiring,\u201d saying over two million protesters have taken to the streets \u201cstanding up for freedom, standing up for democracy, and standing up against the oppression of the Chinese communist regime.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers Wednesday in a letter calling on the NBA to suspend its activities in China until the communist nation ends its boycott and \u201cselective treatment of the Houston Rockets.\u201d\n\n.@SenTedCruz on Hong Kong protests: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here in Hong Kong is inspiring.\u201d pic.twitter.com/LCLwNE34ru \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 13, 2019\n\nThe NBA cancelled media availability for coaches and players in China for preseason games. Stars like the Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry and coach Steve Kerr have declined to comment on the Chinese crackdown, while Houston Rockets forward James Harden said at a press conference, \u201cWe love China and we love playing there.\u201d\n\nNBA players have no problem speaking out on politics & social issues in America.\n\n\n\nBut they apologize to #China for a pro democracy tweet from an @NBA team executive.\n\n\n\nHypocrites https://t.co/Yoeyk7o8XO \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 7, 2019\n\nAfter the NBA issued an initial statement calling the tweet \u201cregrettable,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver came out with a stronger stance, saying, \u201cthe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\nMr. Morey\u2019s tweet, which he has since deleted, said, \u201cFight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nChinese Central Television accused Mr. Silver of using free speech as an \u201cexcuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe voice our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Adam Silver offering as an excuse the right to freedom of expression,\u201d said the CCTV statement. \u201cWe believe that no comments challenging national sovereignty and social stability fall within the scope of freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
