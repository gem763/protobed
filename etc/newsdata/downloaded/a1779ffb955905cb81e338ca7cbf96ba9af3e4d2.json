Jeff Tweedy. Photo: Josh Brasted/Getty Images\n\nJeff Tweedy is aware that some fans think he made his best album 20 years ago, but he\u2019s most proud of whatever he\u2019s working on now. He\u2019s especially proud of Ode to Joy, Wilco\u2019s upcoming 11th album. It\u2019s the first Wilco album in over a decade that has teeth. Baby teeth, but still: Listening to these aching, minimalist songs is like revisiting a growing pain you thought you took care of long ago that has come back in a new and frightening way. In honor of the old and new, here\u2019s Tweedy engaging with some of the most and least and best and worst of Wilco.\n\nBest Wilco Song\n\nIt\u2019s always the song I\u2019m working on that\u2019s my favorite. As far as evaluating older songs and songs that I\u2019ve already written, I\u2019m not the best at it. [But off the new album] I\u2019ll say \u201cQuiet Amplifier,\u201d because I think it\u2019s a really successful experiment. That song became the overall template for the record in terms of a cohesive sonic landscape. I think everything else is kind of contained in that song. The drum sound and melodic sensibility \u2014 there\u2019s a restraint to it, but it also seems sort of violent in some weird way.\n\nWorst Wilco Song\n\nThat\u2019s a lot easier. A few years ago, we played all of the songs we had ever recorded and released in a series of shows in Chicago. There were only a couple that I really felt bad about playing. I just thought the songs were total dog shit. And one of them was off the first record, \u201cI Thought I Held You.\u201d I introduced it as being the most dog-shit song of the whole batch, and people were like, \u201cAww,\u201d and I realized that some people really liked that song. And then I felt bad. I\u2019ve probably written worse songs.\n\nMost Surprising Use of \u201cJesus, Etc.\u201d\n\nSwisher Sweets did a video a few years ago where they played that song for a bunch of different people who had never heard it before and asked them what it means. The reaction to it is mostly positive, but they\u2019re all like, \u201cEach star is a setting sun\u201d; \u201cThat\u2019s factually correct\u201d; \u201cThat\u2019s tight.\u201d\n\nFavorite to Play Live\n\nRight now, it\u2019s probably \u201cReservations\u201d off Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The arrangement we\u2019ve been playing lately is so precarious feeling. It seems so unsettlingly naked that even a loud audience kind of gets quiet. I enjoy that sensation.\n\nLeast Favorite to Play Live\n\n\u201cCalifornia Stars\u201d is a bit of a slog sometimes, just because it\u2019s the same two verses as four verses, but you just repeat the first two verses. But we do a good job of making it pretty fresh to ourselves every night.\n\nSong You Wished More People Requested You Play Live\n\nMaybe \u201cMagnetized\u201d off Star Wars or \u201cHappiness\u201d off Schmilco. Something off the last two records. I don\u2019t want to say they were underappreciated, but they were maybe undersold?\n\nSong That Sounds the Most Like Your Hometown\n\n\u201cVia Chicago\u201d sounds like an obvious choice, but there was an effort to try and re-create the sensation of walking underneath the L tracks. Basically, trying to have a conversation with someone you\u2019re walking with and having it be completely destroyed or undermined by this brutal noise. I don\u2019t think we did a good job of it, actually. I think we got better at doing it live.\n\nFavorite Lyrics\n\nI don\u2019t think there are any that I don\u2019t wish I could change or make better. I always want to get better. I thought the song \u201cCommon Sense\u201d on the last record had some pretty powerful lyrics that were maybe undermined a little by some of the quirkiness of that recording.\n\nLeast Favorite Lyrics\n\nIt\u2019s not a Wilco song, but in \u201cThe Ruling Class,\u201d by [my side project] Loose Fur, I sing, \u201cYou better turn your frown upside down / Christ is on his way across town.\u201d That\u2019s just terrible.\n\nFavorite Song off the New Album\n\nMy favorite songs are generally the songs that I feel like someone else could have written or someone else could sing, where I feel like I tapped into something that is just a classic songwriting kind of thing. \u201cWhite Wooden Cross\u201d to me is one of those types of songs where I can hear a lot of different people singing it. A lot of different people might have been able to write it, if they had been in the right circumstance. Your requirements aren\u2019t as personalized.\n\nFavorite Guitar Moment\n\nThe moment where all three guitars start harmonizing during the end of the solo of \u201cImpossible Germany.\u201d It\u2019s still something you look forward to every night because it just feels so good. It sounds so good to my ears still, and there\u2019s a visceral reaction in the audience almost every night.\n\nMost Secretly Political Song\n\nI guess the secret to me is that I think all art that has any possibility of changing someone\u2019s perception is political. Any art that ends up saying to someone, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way\u201d is a political moment in someone\u2019s life. It was a political moment when I discovered music and was encouraged to challenge my environment\u2019s view of the world. And that wasn\u2019t from just what the lyrics were saying. It was from the idea that you could empower yourself with art. That you could invent yourself. That you could create. A lot of people become convinced that they can\u2019t do that. I think encouraging people to think that they can do that is political.\n\nSo, I guess all of them?\n\nSong You\u2019re Most Proud of Writing\n\nThe thing I would be most proud of writing is whatever song seems to mean the most to other people. For me, as a songwriter, it\u2019s not just Wilco. It\u2019s having written \u201cYou Are Not Alone\u201d for Mavis Staples to sing. That means a lot to me because it means a lot to her, and it seems to mean a lot to other people. The other one would be \u201cCalifornia Stars,\u201d because I got to contribute to Woody Guthrie\u2019s presence in the world.\n\n*A version of this article appears in the September 2, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
