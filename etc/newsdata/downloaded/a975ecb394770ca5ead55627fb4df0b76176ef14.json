REUTERS/Jorge Silva/File Photo\n\nWith economic growth slowing sharply, job security fraying and holes in social safety nets widening, a wave of protest has arisen, spanning millions of people across the continent.\n\nThe end of the \u2018pink tide\u2019 of leftist leaders that swept Latin America in the 2000s gave way in recent years to a series of more broadly conservative governments.\n\nBut while each country has its own issues, there has been a common backlash against the \u201cmarket-friendly\u201d policies pursued by some of those governments - such as the privatising of state assets, reduction of public subsidies, and exposure of more aspects of society to market forces.\n\nIn Chile, which introduced market reforms long before the rest of the region and is seen by many as a posterchild of neoliberalism, some 1 million people marched on Friday to protest the conservative economic agenda of billionaire President Sebastian Pinera, the largest protest since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1990.\n\nThat followed a week of riots in which at least 18 people were killed. The unrest began after the government raised the price of metro fares, but reflected long-simmering anger at its failure to alter Chile\u2019s economic course despite growing inequality.\n\n\u201cThere are two Chiles here. The Chile of people with money, and the Chile of the poor,\u201d said Nathaly Melendez, 28, a manicurist in Santiago. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have money, you have to wait in long lines for healthcare, education is terrible, students are all in debt.\u201d\n\nThe protests in Chile came hot on the heels of violent demonstrations in Ecuador sparked by a proposed cut to decades-old fuel subsidies, which forced the government to temporarily relocate the capital to Guayaquil.\n\nAnd in perhaps the most emphatic rejection of austerity and business friendly reforms, Argentine voters on Sunday removed conservative President Mauricio Macri in favour of Peronist Alberto Fernandez - a landslide backing for a decidedly more protectionist agenda.\n\nBranko Milanovic, visiting professor at The City University of New York and an expert on inequality, said the uneven effects of globalisation had sown discontent in Latin America.\n\nGlobalisation in recent decades brought a surge in low-cost products from emerging countries like China and expanded the export markets for Latin America\u2019s commodities, helping to fuel economic growth, but many across the region feel the rewards have accrued mostly to the wealthy.\n\nBy some measures, Chile is one of the most unequal countries in Latin America, though it also has the highest average income. According to Milanovic, the combined wealth of Chilean billionaires in 2015 was equal to a quarter of gross domestic product - the highest in the world, excluding tax havens like Cyprus, and around double the level of Mexico and Peru.\n\n\u201cIf there is no social justice and minimum of social cohesion, the effects of growth will dissolve in grief, demonstrations, and yes, in the shooting of people,\u201d Milanovic wrote.\n\nLeftist leaders have been galvanized by the backlash. Evo Morales, Bolivia\u2019s socialist leader now facing widespread protests after a disputed election win this month, has looked to rally his supporters with warnings about the return of neoliberalism should he lose power.\n\nCreomar De Souza, founder of Brasilia-based consultancy Dharma Political Risk And Strategy, said the longer-term policy impact of the upheavals was not yet clear.\n\n\u201cBut in some of these countries, Argentina and maybe Bolivia, the economy will take a more heterodox turn, with a greater role for the state,\u201d De Souza said. \u201cPinera will try to endorse some social reforms in Chile, but the legitimacy of that generation of politicians is under threat.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE GETTING POORER\n\nThe unrest coincides with a slide in Latin American economic growth in the wake of a long commodities-driven boom. The International Monetary Fund this month slashed its growth forecasts for the region this year to a dismal 0.2% - the second-slowest rate in the world, behind the Middle East and North Africa\u2019s 0.1%.\n\nWhile many people globally feel poorer as the world economy slows, in Latin America it is actually true, according to World Bank figures.\n\nThe Bank uses a variety of measures to track GDP per capita, depending on exchange rate fluctuations, and most of them suggest it is lower in the region today than it was five years ago.\n\nAccording to its measure using current U.S. dollars, GDP per capita in Latin America last year was $9,023, down 13% from the peak of $10,405 in 2014.\n\nThe process is not helped by government\u2019s efforts in countries like Argentina, Chile and Brazil to reduce budget deficits.\n\nAna Lia Agullo, a 69-year old retiree in Buenos Aires, said Argentina\u2019s new government needed to refocus on employment, health and education, \u201cthe pillars of every society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally different from Macri\u2019s supposed model, which is obviously not a model at all but rather a big-business trick typical of people belonging to his class,\u201d she said.\n\nMoody\u2019s warned that social pressure would likely also force Pinera to ease efforts to reduce the deficit and stop Chile\u2019s debt growing.\n\nOpposition to Chile\u2019s direction may be of particular interest for Brazil watchers, given that Economy Minister Paulo Guedes is a devotee of its economic model.\n\nAn orthodox University of Chicago-trained economist, Guedes failed in his attempt to introduce a pension system in Brazil based on the Chilean model of private savings accounts - though his reform, passed this month, will save the public purse 800 billion reais ($200 billion) over the next decade by raising the minimum retirement age and increasing workers\u2019 contributions.\n\nThe remainder of his reform agenda, which includes labour market deregulation and ramping up privatisation, may face increased political resistance.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nMemories linger of Brazil\u2019s brutal recession in 2015-16 as well as last year\u2019s truckers\u2019 strike over diesel price hikes that brought the country to a standstill. So far, there is no sign of people taking to the streets again in Brazil, but the political mood appears to be turning against Guedes\u2019 agenda.\n\nCentre-right lawmaker Marcelo Ramos said Brazil needed investment to grow again, but it also needed to tackle inequality.\n\nThe inequality \u201ckeeps millions of Brazilians from being consumers and demands heavy social spending on unemployed, discouraged and underutilised workers,\u201d he said.", "description": "From the streets of Santiago and Quito to the ballot boxes of Buenos Aires, many South Americans have strongly rejected in recent weeks their leaders' free market agendas, amid outcry that they are fueling inequality across the region.", "authors": ["Jamie Mcgeever", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446474339&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0LO", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
