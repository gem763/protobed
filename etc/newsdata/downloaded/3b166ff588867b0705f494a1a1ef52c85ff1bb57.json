(AP) - Quarterback Malcolm Perry rushed for 218 yards and three touchdowns on 20 carries to lead Navy to a 45-17 victory over Tulsa on Saturday.\n\nJamale Carothers, Nelson Smith and C.J. Williams also scored rushing touchdowns for Navy (4-1, 2-1 American). The Midshipmen snapped a 14-game losing streak in contests played outside of Annapolis, a stretch that dated back to their previous trip to Tulsa, a 31-21 victory on Sept. 30, 2017.\n\nNavy entered the day leading the nation in rushing with an average of 312 yards per game and added to that total in this one, gaining 388 yards on the ground. Out of 63 overall offensive plays, the Midshipmen ran the ball 58 times.\n\nZach Smith threw for 254 yards and a touchdown for Tulsa (2-4, 0-2), which lost its fifth straight game to Navy. JuanCarlos Santana had nine receptions for 98 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen\u2019s defense entered the day ranked 13th in the nation in rushing defense, giving up 90.3 yards per contest, and allowed Tulsa just 25 yards on the ground through the first half and 69 overall, 50 of which came on one drive early in the third quarter. Navy also ranked 12th in total defense before the game, allowing an average of 277 yards, and Tulsa gained just 99 in the first half and 174 through the first three quarters before ending up with 323 overall, adding more in the fourth quarter with the game already out of reach.\n\nTulsa: The Golden Hurricane had several missed opportunities in the first quarter that might have made a difference. On their first possession, Jacob Rainey\u2019s 30-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright for Tulsa\u2019s fourth straight missed field goal attempt (three by Rainey). Then on Tulsa\u2019s third drive, after Rainey did connect on a 41-yard field goal, it looked like Smith connected with Sam Crawford for a 98-yard touchdown pass. But following a lengthy review, the play ended up being called back when it was determined that Crawford stepped out of bounds before making the catch.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNavy returns home to Annapolis on Saturday to take on USF.\n\nTulsa goes on the road to face No. 25 Cincinnati on Saturday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Quarterback Malcolm Perry rushed for 218 yards and three touchdowns on 20 carries to lead Navy to a 45-17 victory over Tulsa on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Tranchina"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/navy_tulsa_football_98915_c0-211-2400-1611_s1200x700.jpg?a885c38825ef0cc1bc8fb696306365cf5f14f570", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
