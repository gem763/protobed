Show Hide Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history. After three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro. Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002. While he was seen as a \u201cyoung, thrusting moderniser\u201d, Cummings quickly offended party traditionalists. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent. Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education complained to the Independent of an \u201cus-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture\u201d created by Cummings and Gove. He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching media interviews and published rambling blogposts that are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as \u201ca sphinx without a riddle\u201d, and former Brexit minister David Davis as \u201cthick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus\u201d. In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum leave campaign in April of the following year. Since the EU referendum, its tactics have been the subject of a series of high-profile scandals. Vote Leave\u2019s use of data analytics has been scrutinised after the Observer reported that the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica had links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ, on which Vote Leave spent 40% of its campaign budget.\n\nIn July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was fined \u00a361,000 and referred to the police.\n\nCummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news. Frances Perraudin\n\nNoting that one of the 21 MPs was Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, Hoare tweeted: \u201cI think we are better being like Churchill NOT Stalin.\u201d\n\nSimon Hoare Esq., MP (@Simon4NDorset) There\u2019s deep disquiet across the Party at the handling of this issue of the Whip. We can\u2019t win unless our base is broad and representative of all strands of opinion. No10 needs to rethink and fast. I think we are better being like Churchill and NOT Stalin #toriesdontpurge https://t.co/3pwr1rsbr6\n\nRebel fears that Cummings was behind the expulsions appeared to be confirmed by the report of a foul-mouthed tirade by him directed at one of the rebels, the former business secretary Greg Clark.\n\nThe Daily Mail claimed Cummings said: \u201cWhen are you fucking MPs going to realise we are leaving on October 31? We are going to purge you.\u201d No 10 has admitted that Cummings has had robust conversations with rebels, but denied he swore.\n\nOn Wednesday night the former justice secretary David Gauke, one of the 21 expelled MPs, delivered barbed tweets about his treatment, which pointed out that Cummings was not a member of the party.\n\nAfter being told by his constituency chairman he was no longer a member of the Conservative party, Gauke sarcastically said: \u201cI finally have something in common with Dominic Cummings.\u201d When it was clarified that he was still a member but could not stand for the party, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t have anything in common with Dominic Cummings after all.\u201d\n\nDavid Gauke (@DavidGauke) Just received an urgent clarification. Membership still valid but barred from being re-selected. I don\u2019t have anything in common with Dominic Cummings after all.\n\n\n\nA happy note on which to end the day.\n\nEarlier, Margot James, another former minister who was expelled over the rebellion, said it was \u201chigh time\u201d Cummings\u2019 \u201cwings were clipped\u201d. She described the former Vote Leave supremo as \u201cvery dangerous indeed\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to PA Media she said: \u201cHe is ruthless, he couldn\u2019t care less whether we got a deal or whether we didn\u2019t and he rules with a rod of iron. I don\u2019t approve of the way he treats people, apropos that poor special adviser who did nothing wrong whatsoever. I mean, I could go on but you know my opinion of the man.\u201d\n\nShe made the comments after challenging Johnson in prime minister\u2019s questions about the role of Cummings.\n\nShe said: \u201cA great lady, who you and I both revere, I am sure Mr Speaker, once said \u2018advisers advise, ministers decide\u2019. Can I ask the prime minister to bear that statement closely in mind in relation to his own chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.\u201d\n\nDamian Green, the former cabinet minister and leader of the One Nation group of Conservatives, called for the reinstatement of the expelled 21 rebels.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC on Thursday, he said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid it does look as though somebody has decided that the moderate, progressive wing of the Conservative party is not wanted on voyage.\n\nQ&A How do I register to vote in a general election? Show Hide To vote in a general election you must: be 18 or over on the day of the election (\u2018polling day\u2019)\n\nbe a British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizen\n\nbe resident at an address in the UK (or a British citizen living abroad who has been registered to vote in the UK in the last 15 years)\n\nnot be legally excluded from voting You also need to be on the electoral register. You only have to register once, but will need to re-register if you have changed your address, name or nationality.\n\nThe forms can be completed online. You may need details of your national insurance number your passport if you\u2019re a British citizen living abroad, and want to vote in England, Scotland or Wales. If you need help, you should contact your local Electoral Registration Office. You can use this service to find their address if you live in England, Scotland or Wales. If you live in Northern Ireland you need to contact the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wrong in principle because there are many Conservative traditions, but it is terrible practical politics to narrow your appeal just before a general election.\u201d\n\nThe chancellor, Sajid Javid, has refused to deny that he objected to the expulsions.\n\nAsked on BBC Breakfast about reports of a row in cabinet over the issue, Javid said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into discussions I\u2019ve had with the prime minister, but I\u2019m sad to see 21 colleagues no longer carrying the Conservative whip.\n\n\u201cThese are my friends. These are good people. But they also knew that when the prime minister of the day says a vote is a matter of confidence, what would be the consequences of opposing that.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Deep disquiet\u2019 in Tory ranks after 21 MPs had whip withdrawn and were barred from standing in election", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "Tom Kibasi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a91f9990853f6c698c57e6ab59b24646fdf1272a/0_57_3720_2232/master/3720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2675c2aa71b9a2ecae63624c605a7bfa", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
