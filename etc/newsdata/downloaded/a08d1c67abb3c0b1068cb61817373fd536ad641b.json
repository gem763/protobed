Sacoolas was allegedly driving the car and, claiming diplomatic immunity, flew back to the US.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents travelled to New York this week to urge Sacoolas to return and engage with a police investigation. They were surprised to receive an abrupt invitation to the White House in Washington on Tuesday \u2013 and even more taken aback by the offer that came without prior warning from Trump, a former reality TV host.\n\n\u201cThe bombshell was dropped soon after we walked in the room: Anne Sacoolas was in the building and was willing to meet with us,\u201d Charles told reporters after the meeting, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes. \u201cWe made it very clear that, as we\u2019ve said all along, we will meet with her and we would still love to meet with her but it has to be on our terms and on UK soil.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Theguardian.Com Us-News Oct Harry-Dunn-Parents-Trump-White-House-Anne-Sacoolas"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
