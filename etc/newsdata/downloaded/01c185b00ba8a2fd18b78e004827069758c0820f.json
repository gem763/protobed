Avenatti voiced his outspoken criticism of the president in frequent cable television appearances and took on one of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s later accusers as a client before eventually being arrested in March in New York.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors charged Avenatti with stealing nearly $300,000 from Daniels while working as her attorney to help her secure a book deal, Reuters reported. During a brief hearing Tuesday, Avenatti\u2019s lawyer, Dean Steward, said he\u2019s considering filing a motion to dismiss the case, asserting that prosecutors were motivated by the \u201cvindictiveness\u201d of the Trump administraion.\n\nU.S. District Judge Deborah Batts said the Southern District of New York, which is prosecuting the case, \u201cis not known for being vindictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, I\u2019m not going to go head-to-head with Donald Trump in this case,\u201d Batts continued, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nAvenatti allegedly forged Daniels\u2019 signature in a letter directing her literary agent to send an installment of $148,750 from an $800,000 book advance to Avenatti's own bank account. Prosecutors claim Avenatti eventually repaid the money to Daniels but when she asked about the second installment of the same amount, he falsely told her the publisher still owed him the payment and that he was still working on obtaining the money, according to Reuters.\n\nHe faces a separate federal case in New York on charges he tried to extort sports apparel firm Nike Inc. for more than $20 million, the New York Daily News reported. That trial was scheduled for November, but he asked that it be postponed until January. Avenatti is scheduled to stand federal trial May 19 in Los Angeles to face charges he sole millions from clients to fund personal and business expenses and lied to the IRS and a Mississippi bank about his financial history, Reuters reported.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nDaniels has claimed she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and received payments from Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen to keep quiet about it during the 2016 presidential election.
