In my tests, with that always-on feature enabled because we think it's the best new feature in this watch, I sometimes got fewer than 18 hours of battery life from the new Watch, and I sometimes got more than 18 hours.\n\nThe battery life depends on a wide variety of factors, including how often you look at your watch (the always-on display gets brighter when you turn and lift your wrist to look at it), whether you use GPS tracking in the watch's marvellous array of sports modes, and if, or how much, much you use the watch's eSIM capabilities, that let you leave your iPhone at home and still receive calls and messages directly to the Watch over the 4G network.\n\nSo let's just agree that Apple is right and the new watch still has an all-day battery life, even with the new always-on display.\n\nIt may have a dodgy battery life, but it's easily the most stylish computer you can strap to your wrist.\n\nWell, that's a terrible battery life in a device category which, historically, had a multi-year or even indefinite battery life (I had a Seiko watch that recharged itself just by being worn).\n\nSo that's one omission, and it's one for which we have no explanation. I honestly don't know why anyone thinks a day is long enough on a watch. Has no one heard of weekends away? Does no Apple Watch wearer ever get drunk and pass out at night?\n\nBut the other omission on the Apple Watch is something we've been investigating too, and we've come to believe that Apple has adopted an approach that is serving its loyal customers well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSleep tracking feature omitted\n\nI'm talking about the sleep tracking feature that many Apple Watch fans were hoping would appear in the Series 5, but which is absent.\n\nIt turns out, Apple was right to leave it out. Sleep trackers are bogus.\n\nYou may recall, a few years ago we did a test here in the Labs where we attached eight pedometers to a subject, got him to walk around for a day, and compared the result. We came to realise that the pedometers in wearables and phones are basically full of baloney and that their results are only \"indicative\" and not nearly as accurate as they purport to be.\n\n(Interestingly, Apple is one of the few companies that adopted what we think is a realistic attitude to bogus step counting with its Watch. It does give you a step count with the Apple Watch Series 5, to be sure, but it emphasises movement, in general, rather than steps in particular, and we think that's a better approach.)\n\nSome of the watch faces are just stunning.\n\nFor this review, I've conducted a similar experiment, wearing the Apple Watch on one wrist (the left) with a third-party sleep tracker app added, and a Samsung Galaxy Watch (which comes with a sleep tracker app already installed) on the other, and used them to measure sleep for three nights.\n\nUnfortunately, my results were all over the place. It was like they were with pedometers, only worse. The devices on the left and the right wrists never came within cooee of each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn two of the three nights, the third-party app on the Apple Watch, which claims it uses both heart rate and wrist movement to calculate sleep, said I had zero deep sleep and only four or five hours of any sleep, while the Samsung watch said I had almost double the sleep and plenty of motionless sleep.\n\nMotionless sleep is not the same as deep sleep. From what I've read, it is possible to have motionless sleep without deep sleep, meaning that element of our results may not be quite as contradictory as it appears. But, the fact that two different sleep trackers seem to be measuring two different aspects of sleep is itself troublesome, because as a user of these devices you're left wondering which aspects are important to track, and which are not.\n\nOn the third night, with the watches still on the same wrists, the results flipped. The third-party app on the Apple Watch said the subject had loads of sleep of all types (so much sleep that it was longer than I was actually in bed for), and the Samsung said the subject had a miserable 5 hours 54 minutes of total sleep, once again including a healthy dose of motionless sleep.\n\nWe can think of a couple of explanations for our results.\n\nOne explanation is that you get very different results depending on which wrists you wear your sleep tracker on, and how your arms move in your sleep. It might be that you move your left hand in your sleep and not your right one, or vice versa.\n\nBut really, it's probably the case that sleep trackers just aren't accurate enough to be useful. Apple has shown prudent judgement by shying away from releasing one until it can do it properly.\n\nSo maybe it's not an omission at all. Maybe it's just an inclusion of good and common sense.", "description": "As Samsung did with its Galaxy Watch back in 2016, Apple has now added an \"always-on\" mode to the Watch Series 5, so it always looks like you're wearing a watch.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_24/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4abce5cf5825c9e297b8beb0b0cfabc3df3e9d80", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
