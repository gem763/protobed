REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\n\nSome in the nine-member board stressed the need to communicate to markets the BOJ has all options on the table including cutting interest rates, increasing asset buying and printing money at a faster pace, the summary of the Sept. 18-19 meeting showed.\n\n\u201cThere is a significant chance the economy will lose momentum to hit our price target. As such, we should consider whether or not to take additional easing steps,\u201d one member was quoted as saying. \u201cThe BOJ needs to consider all possible policy measures without preconception,\u201d the member added.\n\nAnother board member said it was important for the BOJ to communicate to markets it has not run out of policy options, and that \u201cany kinds of measures are possible at all times.\u201d\n\nAt the September meeting, the BOJ kept policy steady but signaled the chance of expanding stimulus as early as its next meeting in October by issuing a stronger warning on overseas risks.\n\nBoard members Goushi Kataoka and Yutaka Harada dissented on the decision to keep the BOJ\u2019s yield targets intact, arguing that stronger stimulus measures were needed to fight off risks to Japan\u2019s fragile economic recovery.\n\nIn keeping policy steady, the BOJ said Japan\u2019s economy continued to expand moderately as a trend, and that the bank will act if risks threaten to derail the path toward achieving its elusive 2% price target.\n\nSome board members warned that overseas risks, such as the simmering Sino-U.S. trade war, could delay any pick-up in global demand and may already have inflicted enough harm to Japan\u2019s economy to justify action.\n\nBut several others appeared wary of pre-committing to action too hastily, signaling that more time was needed to determine whether the benefits of ramping up an already massive stimulus exceeded the costs, the summary showed.\n\n\u201cAt the October meeting, it\u2019s important to re-examine economic and price developments,\u201d while taking into account the outcome of the BOJ\u2019s quarterly \u201ctankan\u201d business sentiment survey due on Oct. 1 and the analyses of the central bank\u2019s regional branch managers, one member said.\n\n\u201cThat said, the BOJ should not have any preconceptions at this point regarding the outcome of its examination and future policy conduct,\u201d the member was quoted as saying.\n\nUnder its yield curve control (YCC) policy, the BOJ pledges to guide short-term rates at -0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield around 0%. It also buys government bonds and risky assets to accelerate inflation to its 2% price goal.\n\nThe BOJ is in a bind. Years of heavy money printing has failed to fire up inflation and left it with few ammunition to fight the next recession.\n\nProlonged ultra-low rates have also strained financial institutions\u2019 profits. While BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said he won\u2019t rule out deepening negative rates, critics of his policies say any such move could push some regional banks into financial trouble.", "description": "Bank of Japan policymakers debated the feasibility of ramping up stimulus in the near future when they met for a rate review in September, a summary of their opinions showed on Monday, as intensifying overseas risks cloud the economic outlook.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435342815&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T007", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
