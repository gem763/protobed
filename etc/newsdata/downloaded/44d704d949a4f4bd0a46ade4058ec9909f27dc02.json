I think he\u2019s at 70 per cent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think he will run a good race because he is a good horse, he\u2019s very genuine and he always tries his best. Hopefully after this race he can improve even more.\u201d", "description": "He\u2019s outlined the Dubai World Cup meeting and the US$20 million Saudi Cup as options for dirt specialist Elusive State but Tony Millard says \u201cthe talk stops here\u201d ahead of the six-year-old\u2019s run at Sha Tin on Sunday....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/26/7453b1dc-f627-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_145204.JPG?itok=Ag6S3ggR&v=1572072733", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
