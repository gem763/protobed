Check out Andy Lack's past!\"\n\nHere is the full text from Andy Lack's email to staff:\n\nOn Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company's standards. As a result, we've decided to terminate his employment. While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he's been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.\n\nOur highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender.We are deeply saddened by this turn of events. But we will face it together as a news organization \u2013 and do it in as transparent a manner as we can. To that end, Noah and I will be meeting with as many of you as possible throughout the day today to answer your questions.\n\nAndy\n\nEditor's Note: NBC is an investor in Axios and Andy Lack is on the Axios board.\n\nGet more stories like this by signing up for our daily morning newsletter, Axios AM.", "description": "NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said this morning in an email to NBC News staff.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/z_-keRs1StrMxn8I0-QIXkEVHro=/1920x1080/smart/2017/12/16/1513388344814.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-16"}
