People have different career paths and [relationships] can come under strain,\" he added.\n\n\"I think a lot of them will do really well,\" Olivia agreed. \"Its mad we're still going this far on. We never thought we'd get our own TV show three years after Love Island happened.\n\n\"We're really grateful.
