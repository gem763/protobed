Storing all the information we ever encounter would be difficult to manage.\"\n\nThere was once a time when everyone knew their friends' phone numbers \u2014 now, many trust a device more than themselves, leaving some experts to wonder if this \"information offloading\" is making their memory and information control worse.\n\nThe fear of technology replacing human functions is valid, says Risko, who is also the Canada research chair in embodied and embedded cognition.\n\n\"Anytime there's been kind of massive changes in the technological environment, we've seen concern.\n\n\"[But] it doesn't mean that it's going to turn out badly. I think it should motivate us to be careful, as we should [be].\"\n\nBrains are not computers\n\n\u201cOur memory is fragile and imperfect in many ways,\u201d says Evan Risko, University of Waterloo associate professor. (Wikipedia)\n\nIn his book Scatterbrain: How the Mind's Mistakes Make Humans Creative, Innovative, and Successful, neuroscientist Henning Beck argues our brains \u2014 to be as efficient as possible \u2014 are constantly dumping and rearranging information.\n\nRather than being an endless storage space, he compares the brain to an orchestra: our brain cells interact with each other like musicians.\n\n\"It is about creating that specific memory at this very moment, just like [how] an orchestra creates music at that very moment \u2026 [it's] not stored anywhere,\" he said to Young.\n\nAccordingly, Risko says human brains can often be faulty.\n\n\"Our memory is fragile and imperfect in many ways,\" he said.\n\n\"And writing things down, or storing them in some sort of digital memory, gives us the advantage of a highly accurate memory store.\"\n\nBenefits and disadvantages of offloading\n\nBut technology is susceptible to manipulation, he notes.\n\nIn an experiment at the Cognition and Natural Behaviour Laboratory at the University of Waterloo, researchers gave participants an external storage tool, such as a word processor, as an aid to memorize a list of words.\n\nOn the last trial, the researchers changed some of the information the participants had recorded to see if they would notice \u2014 and they didn't.\n\nA Winnipeg woman using her smartphone.

I won't remember as many scenes from the route that I travelled,\" said Risko.\n\n\"[But] we should weigh that against the benefits. I know if I didn't have GPS \u2026 I wouldn't get to half the places I was going [to].\"\n\nWritten by Chelsey Gould.
