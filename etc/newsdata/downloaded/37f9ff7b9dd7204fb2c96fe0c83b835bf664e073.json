Mandatory Credit: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWawrinka was leading 6-4 7-5 2-1 when Djokovic decided he could not continue, the pair embracing at the side of the court before the Serb walked off with his head down low but his left thumb stuck high in the air.\n\n\u201cThe pain was constant for weeks now. Some days higher, some days with less intensity, and obviously taking different stuff to kill the pain instantly,\u201d said Djokovic, who has won the U.S. Open three times.\n\n\u201cSometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou just know when you know, I guess, when you feel like you\u2019re not able to hit the shot anymore.\u201d\n\nAfter dropping the second set, Djokovic immediately called for medical attention and sat courtside without his shirt on while the trainer gave him a massage.\n\nHe returned to the court but the 16-times Grand Slam winner was still clearly hampered by the issue and after being broken to love following a double fault decided he could not go on.\n\nThe shoulder injury nearly saw Djokovic retire from his second-round match on Wednesday but the 32-year-old seemed to have recovered by Friday, saying he was almost pain-free after winning in straight sets to reach the last 16.\n\nWhile frustrated in his bid to inch closer to Roger Federer\u2019s all-time record of 20 career Grand Slam titles, Djokovic was confident there would be plenty more chances to add to his collection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long road ahead hopefully for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope I can play for many more years. I\u2019m planning to. I mean, I don\u2019t see an end behind the corner at all.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s a matter of keeping my body and mind in shape and trying to still peak at these kind of events that are majors and that are the most significant in our sport.\u201d\n\nDjokovic was off the pace in a lacklustre first set against three-times Grand Slam champion Wawrinka but seemed to right the ship in the second when he took a 4-1 lead.\n\nBut a determined Wawrinka, with his serve clicking, fought his way back and twice held to love en route to taking the set for a 2-0 lead.\n\nWawrinka, who had not faced Djokovic since beating him in the 2016 U.S. Open final, said he could see his opponent was struggling but did his best to focus on his own game.\n\n\u201cFor sure I could see some little thing that he was in trouble,\u201d said Wawrinka, who will face Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cBut I was most likely, most of the time, focused on myself because I know how well he can fight. I know how well he can come back. Doesn\u2019t matter how he\u2019s feeling on the court, and that\u2019s what I was focusing on.\u201d", "description": "Novak Djokovic's U.S. Open title defence came unstuck on Sunday when a nagging shoulder injury forced the world number one to retire from his fourth-round match against Stan Wawrinka, prompting a chorus of boos from the crowd at Flushing Meadows.", "authors": ["Frank Pingue", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425252982&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF81063"}
