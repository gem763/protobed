He was knowledgeable about a range of issues and liked to have discussions,\" he said\n\nA 54-year-old homeless man who lives near where Otonashi slept said Otonashi had not given up on returning to a more socially acceptable way of life.\n\n\"I'd like to return to the society someday (but) I cannot forgive society's discrimination,\" the homeless man recounted Otonashi as telling him.\n\nOtonashi's acquaintance said he warned him about the approaching typhoon the day before it arrived in Tokyo, bringing torrential rain which flooded many rivers.\n\nDespite his warnings to Otonashi, the man himself spent the night of Oct. 12 next to the Tama River and had to be rescued by a helicopter the next morning.\n\nOn the same night, a 56-year-old homeless man was taking shelter at the entrance of East Japan Railway's Ueno Station in Taito Ward.\n\nA concert hall in front of the station entrance had been turned into an evacuation center for foreign tourists and non-Taito Ward residents, but the man said he did not know about it as he had no access to public service information.\n\nAfter it stopped raining that night, the man walked back to an area near the Sumida River, about 2 kilometers away, where he usually sleeps.\n\nWhen he woke up in the morning, his fate could have been the same as Otonashi's as he had to walk through knee-deep water to get to higher ground. He said he sustained a cut to his leg when he encountered broken glass beneath the water.\n\nWhen asked about the three people who had been denied entry to the evacuation center in Taito Ward, he said he thought \"they were shunned because we smell bad and other people wouldn't want to be near us.\"\n\nAccording to a Japanese government survey in January this year, more than 4,500 people sleep rough around the country. About a third of those live close to rivers, often in lightly wooded areas, and are vulnerable to flooding, the survey found.\n\nOn the night of the storm in the city of Hino, where Otonashi's body was found, the local government called on its citizens to evacuate using an emergency radio system for disaster prevention but did not take any special measures for the homeless.\n\nBut some areas are responding to their homeless residents' needs.\n\nTokyo's Setagaya Ward, another through which the Tama River flows, opened an evacuation center near the river and urged homeless people nearby to take shelter on the night Typhoon Hagibis landed on Honshu, Japan's main island.\n\nBut even measures like those implemented by Setagaya Ward are not enough, says Fujita.\n\n\"There are many people who have been repeatedly turned away (in the past) and stopped seeking help,\" Fujita said. \"Unless discrimination in everyday life is eliminated, nothing changes in times of emergency.\"\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "When a massive typhoon ripped through Japan earlier this month, several homeless people were denied access to shelters or emergency assistance, raising concerns about how local governments respond during natural disasters when society's most vulnerable are in peril.
