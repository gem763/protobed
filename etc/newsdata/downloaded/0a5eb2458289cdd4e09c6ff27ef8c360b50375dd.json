The logistics have been brilliant through the whole tournament and it's not due to rain tomorrow.'\n\nBut their squad took the hindrance lightly, splashing around in the water around the ground.\n\nNew Zealand chose not to come to the stadium for their captain's run session, and the Springboks just sent their kickers along.\n\nWorld Rugby are not concerned that the conditions will affect the weekend's matches.\n\nWales braved the conditions and went ahead with their planned training session on Friday\n\nNeil Hatley said England will review travel plans for Saturday after arriving late for training\n\nThis stadium was the one where Japan played against Scotland the day after Typhoon Hagibis ripped through the capital - so it is used to coping with bad weather.\n\nThe rain is set to ease on Friday night and Saturday - when England face New Zealand - is set to be dry.\n\nThere may be a drop of rain for Wales v South Africa on Sunday, though.\n\nIf a game does have to be moved due to the weather there are contingency plans.\n\nSportsmail understands the Tokyo Stadium 12 miles away would be an alternative venue in the highly unlikely event a match had to be moved.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN YOKOHAMA: England and Wales\u00a0had to wade through huge puddles at the Yokohama Stadium before their World Cup semi-finals as a deluge left the pitch in a poor state.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/08/20168976-0-image-a-12_1571987560760.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
