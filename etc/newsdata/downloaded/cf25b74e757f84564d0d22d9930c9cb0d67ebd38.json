If a Democratic president had been caught doing this, of course Limbaugh would be screaming for his impeachment with equal volume and ferocity. What is more interesting is the rationale he offers: a simple appeal to hatred of the opposition\u2014as a justification, as an inducement, as an end in itself.\n\nIf Trump has done something that \u201cupsets the Washington media,\u201d conservatives no longer have to bother asking whether it was good or bad, whether anyone is right or wrong to be upset by it. The very fact that it upsets \u201cthe media\u201d is justification enough.\n\nThe big thing we\u2019ve discovered over the past four years is the number of people for whom the actual content of ideas and policy is largely irrelevant, compared to the pure tribal satisfaction of venting their hatred for the \u201celites\u201d and the \u201cmainstream media.\u201d The source of Donald Trump\u2019s bizarre allure among conservatives is the constant, unrelenting intensity with which he allows them to indulge in this\u2014a form of tribal hatred that is all the purer precisely because it has been freed from any pretense of having to be loyal to abstract principles.\n\nIn short, conservatives have sold their souls for the sheer pleasure of partisan hatred.
