The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer. Turkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years in the wake of the defeat of the territorial \u201cCaliphate\u201d by the United States.\n\nA spokesman for President Erdogan said on Monday that Turkey aims to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the Turkish-Syrian border free of \u201cterrorist elements\u201d into which refugees from Syria can be safely returned. During their phone call on Sunday, Erdogan expressed \u201cfrustration\u201d to Trump over \u201cthe U.S. military and security bureaucracy\u2019s failure\u201d to fulfill an August arrangement for creating such a buffer zone.\n\nThe U.S. has been attempting to delay the proposed Turkish incursion, which would target Kurdish militia known as the People\u2019s Protection Units (known by the Kurdish acronym YPG and YPJ, for the female forces) considered by Erdogan to be terrorist allies of Kurdish separatists belonging to the PKK party in Turkey. The YPG was a U.S. battlefield ally against the Islamic State during the Syrian civil war. The Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) is a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist group.\n\nKurdish commanders also lead an umbrella group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which on Monday denounced the White House announcement as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d that would have a \u201cgreat negative\u201d impact on the ongoing war against ISIS.\n\nA senior SDF official named Mustafa Bali told the Kurdish Rudaw news service the United States was \u201cleaving the area to turn into a war zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SDF is determined to defend NE Syria at all costs,\u201d Bali said.\n\n\u201cU.S. forces on the ground showed us that this is not how they value friendship and alliance,\u201d Bali said on Twitter. \u201cHowever, the decision by [President Trump] is about to ruin the trust and cooperation between the SDF and US built during the fight against ISIS. Alliances are built on mutual trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not expecting the US to protect northeastern Syria. But people here are owed an explanation regarding security mechanism deal, destruction of fortifications and failure of US to fulfill their commitments,\u201d he added.\n\nBali told Voice of America News over the weekend that the SDF sees Turkey\u2019s military threats as \u201cextremely serious\u201d and fears \u201cmass killings would be committed against our people if Turkish forces invaded this part of Syria.\u201d\n\nThe SDF issued a statement repeating Bali\u2019s comments and urging all \u201cKurdish, Arab, Assyrian, and Syriac people to strengthen their unity and stand by the SDF in defense of their land\u201d against the Turks.\n\nA spokesman for President Erdogan responded by insisting Turkey will act only to eliminate members of the YPG \u201cterrorist group\u201d inside a small buffer zone and insisting Ankara \u201csupports Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and political unity.\u201d\n\nThe statement from Erdogan\u2019s office insisted Turkey \u201chas no interest in occupation or changing demographics\u201d and accused the PKK and YPG of already making efforts to do so.\n\n\u201cTurkey fights against a terrorist organization that has also killed and oppressed the Kurds,\u201d the statement declared.\n\nA White House official told Reuters that U.S. troops are initially moving out of the \u201csafe zone\u201d area near the Turkish border, not the entire Syrian theater. Another official said the U.S. still considers the planned Turkish invasion a \u201cbad idea\u201d and said the U.S. \u201cwill not help it in any way, but will also not resist it.\u201d\n\nA Pentagon spokesman told VOA News that an \u201cuncoordinated military operation by Turkey\u201d could \u201cundermine our shared interest of a secure northeast Syria and the enduring defeat of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations on Monday expressed concerns about civilian casualties from the Turkish operation and worried it could trigger a new wave of refugees.\n\n\u201cAny operation that takes place at the moment has to take into account to ensure that we don\u2019t see any further displacement. We are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst,\u201d said U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis on Monday.\n\nMountzis said the U.N. has a \u201cbitter history\u201d with the concept of safe zones and \u201cwe never promote or encourage\u201d such plans.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it is something that had worked for the United Nations, keeping in mind Srebrenica and what had happened in the past,\u201d he said, referring to the 1995 slaughter of some 8,000 Muslims by Bosnian Serb troops in a U.N. safe zone.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that there will be full cooperation by all to make sure that it happens as smoothly as possible, without resulting in displacement, and ensuring protection of civilians, ensuring that the basic principles of humanity will be respected on the ground,\u201d Mountzis said of the impending Turkish operation.\n\nThe European Union on Monday recognized \u201cTurkey\u2019s legitimate concerns\u201d but restated its position that \u201cany sustainable situation will not be reached by military means.\u201d The French Foreign Ministry warned Turkey it could \u201churt regional stability\u201d and trigger a new refugee crisis by invading Syria.\n\nTurkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Although NATO itself was quiet Sunday and Monday about the planned Turkish operation, U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) introduced a bill on Monday that would level sanctions against Turkey and demand its suspension from NATO if the invasion proceeds.", "description": "The White House announces U.S. troops will withdraw from the Turkish-Syrian border as Turkey prepares an invasion against Kurdish forces.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/wi/afp/28/7dc9f4_kurdish-arab-fighters-syrian-democratic-forces-face-treacherous-battle-e1543415116421.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
