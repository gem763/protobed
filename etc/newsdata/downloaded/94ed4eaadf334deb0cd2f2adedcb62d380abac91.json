Cohen has said he did so at the direction of Mr Trump. Cohen has also admitted that he maintained contacts with Russian officials about a potential Trump real estate project in Moscow for months longer than Mr Trump and others admitted. The talks continued well into 2016 during the campaign, he has said. AP 7/12 Stormy Daniels has alleged that she had an affair with Donald Trump in 2006, soon after Melania Trump gave birth to Baron Trump.

REUTERS\n\nThe preceding tweet and opening remarks echoed Mr Trump\u2019s analysis of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The special counsel found that there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, and he also found that Mr Trump could not be exonerated on obstruction of justice.\n\nAttorney General William Barr later made his own decision on obstruction, saying there was insufficient evidence.\n\nA close friend and supporter of the Republican president, Mr Lewandowski is likely to fiercely defend the president \u2014 and he isn\u2019t expected to elaborate much beyond what he told Mr Mueller\u2019s investigators last year.\n\nHe was a central figure in Mr Mueller\u2019s report, as investigators detailed two episodes in which the president asked Mr Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the special counsel investigation. Mr Trump said that if the attorney general would not meet with Mr Lewandowski, then Mr Lewandowski should tell him he was fired.\n\nMr Lewandowski never delivered the message but asked Mr Dearborn, a former aide of the ex-attorney general, to do it. Mr Dearborn said he was uncomfortable with the request and declined to deliver it, according to the report.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Among those guidelines is allowing staff to question witnesses, as will happen for the first time with Mr Lewandowski.\n\nIn letters to the committee on Monday, the White House said that Mr Dearborn and Mr Porter were \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from testifying.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote that the Justice Department had advised, and Mr Trump had directed, them not to attend \u201cbecause of the constitutional immunity that protects senior advisers to the president from compelled congressional testimony.\u201d\n\nIn a separate letter, Mr Cipollone said that Mr Lewandowski, who never worked in the White House, should not reveal private conversations with the president beyond what is in the report. He wrote that his conversations with Mr Trump \u201care protected from disclosure by long-settled principles protecting executive branch confidentiality interests.\u201d\n\nIn his own prepared remarks, Mr Nadler called out the White House for over its efforts to curtail the committee\u2019s first impeachment investigation hearing.\n\n\u201cI think we should call this what it is, an absolute cover-up by the White House,\" he said.\n\nMr Lewandowski then refused to answer questions about meetings he had with the president, saying he wanted to respect the White House\u2019s requests to avoid discussing information not included in the report.\n\nDemocrat Sheila Jackson asked him about specific portions of the Mueller report, posting the content she referred to on a large display screen for him to read, and yet he still refused to answer her questions.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "Corey Lewandowski, the outspoken Republican operative who served as Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, is appearing\u00a0before Congress as part of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s first official hearing in a Democratic-led impeachment investigation.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/18/lewandowski-hearing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
