(AP) - Vic Fangio is just the second of the Denver Broncos\u2019 17 head coaches to start his career 0-2, but he believes that should come with an asterisk.\n\nFangio disputed two calls on Chicago\u2019s final drive Sunday and helped the Bears escape with a 16-14 win on Eddy Pineiro\u2019s field goal as time expired.\n\nOne was a roughing penalty on Bradley Chubb and the other a decision by rookie referee Adrian Hill to put 1 second back on the clock after Allen Robinson\u2019s 20-yard catch at the Denver 35.\n\nAfter Fangio\u2019s gutsy call to go for 2 put them up 14-13 with 31 seconds left, Chubb had what looked like a clean hit on quarterback Mitchell Trubisky just as he got a first-down throw off to his tight end in the right flat.\n\nAsked about the call, Fangio began his Monday news conference this way:\n\n\u201cIn regards to officiating, I\u2019m just going to quote Sean Payton, who\u2019s a much more senior head coach than I am: \u2018We can\u2019t control poor officiating or awful calls.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, the Bears could say the same about the roughing call on Eddie Goldman, who put a clean hit on Joe Flacco earlier in the fourth quarter, tackling the quarterback around the waist.\n\nAnd Fangio had plenty to say about the officials putting time back on the clock after Robinson went to the ground just as the clock ticked to 1 second, then 0, leading the Broncos and their fans celebrating an incredible win while the Bears begged for the crew to put time back on the clock.\n\nThe referee quieted the crowd and the Broncos when he said the Bears had called timeout in the nick of time and put 1 second back on the clock.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there was,\u201d Fangio insisted. \u201cHe went down at 0:01 and nothing in life, in the world, happens simultaneously. There is lag time there, and they didn\u2019t deem there was lag time there.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos hadn\u2019t started a season with consecutive losses in 20 years.\n\n\u201cI thought we won,\u201d Derek Wolfe said. \u201cAnd then I was like, \u2018Wait, how are they kicking a field goal ? The time is out.\u2019 And then before that, I thought, \u2018How do they call a roughing the passer on Chubb?\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nEmmanuel Sanders has 16 receptions for 184 yards, two TDs and a 2-point conversion so far in his comeback from left Achilles tendon surgery and an operation on his right ankle.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nFangio was the designer of the NFL\u2019s best defense in Chicago and the Bears\u2019 hallmarks were takeaways and sacks - two things the Broncos haven\u2019t managed to collect any of so far.\n\nFangio pointed out that both the Raiders (29-27) and Bears (28-26) ran the ball more than they passed it, \u201cwhich is unusual these days.\u201d\n\nPlaying from behind negates the threat of Chubb and Von Miller wrecking opponents\u2019 game plans.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nYes, it was a gut-wrenching loss, but Fangio having the guts to go for 2 raised his standing.\n\n\u201cCoach told us in training camp that he\u2019s going to play aggressive, he\u2019s going to play to win,\u201d Chris Harris Jr. said.\n\nHe backed it up Sunday.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nLT Garett Bolles\u2019 four holding flags Sunday gives him an astonishing 34 infractions in 34 career starts and he\u2019s somehow regressing under Hall of Famer Mike Munchak - he had 10 holding calls his rookie season, nine last year and five already this season.\n\nThree of them on Sunday came on runs.\n\n\u201cI think he suffers from him thinking he\u2019s in good position sometimes and dumps the guy at the end where he thinks it\u2019s a legal block,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cWe have to do a better job of explaining that to him. He\u2019s got to do a better job of listening to the explaining, but I think he can.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Bolles vowed to improve but accused the officials of picking on him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve built a reputation for myself in this league of holding. I disagree with it, to be honest,\u201d Bolles said. \u201c\u2026 That was just unfortunate that they keep coming at me.\u201d\n\nINJURED\n\nRT Ja\u2019Wuan James (knee) won\u2019t be back anytime soon, so with Elijah Wilkinson filling in there, Bolles\u2019 starting job is safe. The Broncos are hoping CB Bryce Callahan (foot) and ILB Todd Davis (calf) can return and give their defense a boost next week.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n6 - the number of consecutive losses by the Broncos, who have lost 30 of their past 46 games.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Broncos have to figure out how to get a lead so they can put pressure on the passer and force mistakes, and with Packers QB Aaron Rodgers up next, Sunday would be a good time to turn things around.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vic Fangio is just the second of the Denver Broncos' 17 head coaches to start his career 0-2, but he believes that should come with an asterisk.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/bears_broncos_football_40294_c0-163-3905-2439_s1770x1032.jpg?761b882bb4c7277dd15d46ab38a624c6dee7e4a4", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
