We challenge the government to explain why loot boxes should be exempt from the Gambling Act.\"\n\nThe committee's findings only serve as recommendations but a law passed by the government could force video game developers to ditch loot boxes entirely.\n\nKostya Lobov, a senior associate in the technology team at London law firm Harbottle & Lewis, told The Independent: \"The significance of the Committee's findings should not be underestimated [and] will affect the regulatory landscape in the UK and potentially further afield.\"", "description": "Video game developer Psyonix\u00a0will replace loot boxes\u00a0in its hugely popular title\u00a0Rocket League, following concerns that they encourage\u00a0children to gamble.\u00a0 A new system called Blueprints will be introduced in December through a game update, which will replace the existing randomised Crates with a more transparent system.", "authors": ["Anthony Cuthbertson"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/03/11/12/rocket_league.jpg"}
