That\u2019s $195,000 per week.\n\nThat\u2019s not bad for a man who, by his own admission, only gets to work 15 minutes before his show starts and does no preparation at all.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever worked with me you\u2019ll know I do very little to zero preparation,\u201d Kyle said on stage. \u201cThere\u2019s a method to that, it\u2019s not just laziness.\n\n\u201cI like to hear things as a listener. Everyone else is very well prepared \u2026 I like to go in with virgin ears and hear everything for the first time. So if I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on \u2026 then the odds are the listener is not going to understand either.\u201d\n\nHIGH ON MARIJUANA\n\nKyle and Jackie O stunned the radio industry at the end of 2013 when they announced they were defecting from 2Day FM to rival station Mix 106.5 (which was rebranded as KIIS FM).\n\nDespite being the number one FM breakfast show in Sydney at the time, the duo had heard whispers that 2Day FM was thinking about replacing them.\n\n\u201cThey wanted us out,\u201d Kyle said about his bosses at 2Day FM. \u201cSo I went home and smoked a sh**load of weed. Then I started making angry phone calls.\u201d\n\nOne of the people he called was ARN radio boss Duncan Campbell who oversaw the struggling Mix 106.5 at the time.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018He\u2019s got the most s**t station in Sydney. What if I took the best show and put it on the most s**t station?\u2019\u201d Kyle said today. \u201cI was so high. I was like, \u2018That\u2019s fu**ing genius!\u2019\u201d\n\nCampbell answered the call, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nCONTROVERSIES GALORE\n\nKyle is the most controversial presenter on FM radio and has been for many years.\n\nThe broadcaster has been involved in a number of almost career-ending dramas, the most recent being when he joked about the Virgin Mary.\n\nSpeaking on stage today, Stefanovic said to Kyle, \u201cIn this new media landscape, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still on the radio\u201d.\n\nBut the radio star said he never sets out to be controversial and isn\u2019t bothered when his name is in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.\n\n\u201cIt used to hurt, now I don\u2019t care,\u201d Kyle said about negative press. \u201cBecause I know that it doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\n\u201cSomeone reads it and goes, \u2018Oh, what a fat f**k!\u2019 and then turns the page and then I\u2019m out of their mind. They\u2019re not holding onto it all day.\n\n\u201cI used to panic about it, now I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kyle apologises for Virgin Mary \u2018joke\u2019 that sparked national outrage\n\nKyle then got sidetracked (and a little X-rated) when he spoke about being even more controversial in his Hot30 days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d done the night show and we were swearing and masturbating on air,\u201d Kyle said.\n\nThe masturbation reference shocked Stefanovic, prompting Kyle to say to the Channel 9 star, \u201cCome on, are you saying in the last year you\u2019ve not jerked off?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t needed to,\u201d quipped Stefanovic, who married Jasmine Yarbrough in Mexico in 2018.\n\n\u201cF**k off!\u201d Kyle laughed. \u201cJust because you don\u2019t need too \u2026 I still prefer that (masturbation), just quietly.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Commercial Radio Awards are on tomorrow night in Brisbane. The big award of the night is Best On Air Team which Kyle and Jackie O are nominated for along with Nova\u2019s Kate, Tim and Marty, WSFM\u2019s Jonesy and Amanda, Fox FM\u2019s Fifi, Fev and Byron, Nova\u2019s Chrissie, Sam and Browny and Triple M\u2019s Kennedy Molloy.\n\nYou can see the full list of nominees here.", "description": "Karl Stefanovic has taken a cheeky swipe at Kyle Sandilands over the radio star\u2019s massive pay rise.", "authors": ["Andrew Bucklow"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e1136ac291979246636cd8fba55df719?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
