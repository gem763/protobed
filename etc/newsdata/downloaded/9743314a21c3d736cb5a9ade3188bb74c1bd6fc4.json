The venue will stage the Olympic tennis tournament next year.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons for playing the doubles was that I wanted to see how the shoulder feels during match play,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cObviously, doubles is quite different from singles, but you\u2019re still playing an official match - you still get the nerves, and have to battle on court.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of serving and returning, slow balls and fast balls, but it seems like my shoulder is fine after that, so I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s going to be the case for the singles.\u201d\n\nDjokovic said it was good to play in Tokyo, \u201cbecause I want to win the Olympic Games next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can get a feel for the court and the conditions, but the tournament will be played a bit earlier than this, at an even warmer time and higher humidity - you have to mentally accept that and then prepare yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully I can come here early for the Olympic tournament and fully prepare myself.\u201d\n\nDjokovic kicks off his singles campaign on Tuesday against Australia\u2019s Alexei Popyrin and - if successful - will meet local wildcard entry Go Soeda in the second round.\n\nThe 133rd-ranked Soeda caused an upset when he beat Jan-Lennard Struff 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3.\n\nFifth-seeded Lucas Pouille also advanced to the second round, where he will meet Yoshihito Nishioka or Joao Sousa - who play later Monday - after easing to a 6-4, 6-3 win over Poland\u2019s Hubert Hurkacz.\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Novak Djokovic's return from injury had a stuttering start at the Japan Open, with defeat Monday in the opening round of doubles.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
