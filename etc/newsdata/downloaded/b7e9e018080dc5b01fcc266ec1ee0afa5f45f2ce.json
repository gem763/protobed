(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nYesterday, the House Judiciary Committee as chaired by Fat Jerry Nadler was revealed to the world for the collection of lackwits that it is. The proximate cause of this revelation was Nadler\u2019s insistence on obtaining televised testimony of former Trump aide and occasional campaign manager and New Hampshire senate candidate Corey Lewandowski. My colleague, Elizabeth Vaughn, has the full story in Lewandowski Trolls Lawmakers At House Judiciary Committee Hearing; Calls Eric Swalwell \u2018President Swalwell\u2019.\n\nThere were epic moments. We have Lewandowski calling Eric Swawell \u201cPresidnent Swalwell.\u201d\n\nCorey Lewandowski mocks Democrat Rep.

And that\u2019s really saying something. pic.twitter.com/jSMA2Scde0 \u2014 Joshua Potash \ud83c\udd98 (@JoshuaPotash) September 17, 2019\n\nCorey Lewandowski blatantly disrespecting Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee: \"Could you repeat the question? I didn't hear it\u2026Just a rant.\" Keep in mind that Lewandowski had intentionally wasted her time and delayed and refused to answer questions for several minutes leading up to this. pic.twitter.com/Jcof65ABhL \u2014 Amee Vanderpool (@girlsreallyrule) September 17, 2019\n\nNadler refused to allow a GOP member any opportunity to question Lewandowski and gave a highly paid consultant and major Democrat donor thirty minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s bring your donor to work day at House Judiciary. Democrats refused to allow a Republican member of Congress to question the witness immediately after allowing a private, paid consultant\u2014and $70K+ donor to Democrats\u2014to grill the witness for 30 minutes straight. pic.twitter.com/fFvaHFoa3h \u2014 Rep. Doug Collins (@RepDougCollins) September 17, 2019\n\nAll this blow-tried toad was able to elicit from Lewandowski was that he doesn\u2019t feel under any obligation to tell the media the truth. [Insert \u201cshocked face\u201d emoji.]\n\nThe audience's disappointed groan when Lewandowski all but admitted he routinely lies to the media was to me the most memorable part of Tuesday's hearing pic.twitter.com/4nPcw1I0u6 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 18, 2019\n\nSomehow this is a major revelation to the same people who pushed lie after lie upon the American people with the Russia Hoax.\n\nIn short, I doubt that there was ever a witness before any House committee who was more richly in contempt of the membership and the process than was Lewandowski. And it was only fair. Nadler and his fluffers have worked long and hard to reach the level of assclownishness they have achieved and they should not be deprived of their reward.\n\nThis morning, CNN had Lewandowski on to be interviewed by one of it dimmer bulbs (this, in a universe of talent that includes Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, and Brian Stelter is not much of a distinction), Alisyn Camerota. It went about as well as could have been expected given Camerota\u2019s lack of talent.\n\nCNN's interview with Corey Lewandowski was, predictably, a mess. Here he is steamrolling Alisyn Camerota as she tries to ask him questions. pic.twitter.com/ctBFyUxECk \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 18, 2019\n\nThe left seems to think that Camerota drew blood because Lewandowski says he never read the Mueller report, but this is the real blood being drawn. CNN is belaboring Lewandowski for lying to the media (I really don\u2019t get why this is a revelation to sane people) while they employ a contributor who is facing indictment for making false statements to the DOJ IG. Not quite credible.\n\nYesterday he walked into a hostile hearing and left a Category 4 hurricane trail of wreckage behind him. He went on CNN this morning and gave a performance that will haunt Camerota\u2019s dreams for a decade or so\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to encounter her at a PTSD clinic\u2026or on Skid Row scoring crack.\n\nDuring the 2015-2106 season, I said some bad things about Lewandowski. They were justified, mind you, but perhaps overly harsh. Based on his performance yesterday and today, I take them all back. I\u2019ll even send some money to his Senate campaign.\n\n=========\n\n=========\n\nLike what you see? Then visit my story archive.\n\nFollow @streiffredstate\n\nI\u2019m on Facebook.
