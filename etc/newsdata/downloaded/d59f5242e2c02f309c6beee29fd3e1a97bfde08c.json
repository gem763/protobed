Candidates during the debate in Ohio briefly touched on some of these topics, but they were only in passing, such as during candidate Andrew Yang\u2019s proposal for universal basic income and how to pay for Medicare for All.\n\nThe silence about issues relevant to most of the population \u2014 either now or later \u2014 is not only disappointing, it\u2019s also harmful for future generations, said Paul Downey, president and chief executive officer of Serving Seniors, a San Diego\u2013based assistance organization for seniors.\n\n\u201cWe are moving towards almost a quarter of the population over 60 in the next two to three decades,\u201d he said. \u201cBuilding infrastructure now and talking about that policy now to best approach this phenomenon is critical.\u201d Not only for current older Americans, but young adults who will retire into this unprepared environment, he added.\n\nSee: Andrew Yang says teaching people financial literacy is \u2018very difficult if they don\u2019t have money\u2019\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said long-term care is something \u201cregular Americans\u201d care about. \u201cWe need to make it easier to get long-term care insurance and strengthen Medicaid,\u201d she said. She called the aging of the population a \u201csilver surge.\u201d That was the only time long-term care was mentioned, and all that was said on the topic.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts mentioned Social Security, but only that it was as close to universal basic income as the country had. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons that I\u2019ve put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now,\u201d she said.\n\nOnly one topic related to older Americans garnered an entire session of the debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times: the ages of three of the candidates. Warren is 70, former Vice President Joe Biden is 76, and Sen. Bernie Sanders is 78, and hosts suggested some voters may be concerned about that come election, and possibly inauguration.\n\nThe questions included asking Sanders how he was doing after suffering a heart attack, and why Biden would be a good president if he entered the White House at an older age.\n\n\u201cThe questions were framed negatively and I thought they were problematic,\u201d said Patrick Button, an economics professor at Tulane University who studies age discrimination. \u201cThere are differences by age \u2014 but some of them are positive and some negative, and the presumptions of the questions were more around the negative.\u201d Older candidates were left defending themselves against their age, while younger candidates \u2014 like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \u2014 had to explain why she had enough experience to be president, even though she is 38.\n\nAlso see: The Democrats missed a big opportunity during the debates\n\nMany Americans are underprepared for retirement, and feel they can\u2019t prioritize retirement saving right now because of other financial obligations or burdens, including rising housing costs, child care and student loan debt.\n\nRetirement and aging also aren\u2019t very attractive topics for people worrying about the present, said Jamie Hopkins, director of retirement research at Carson Wealth. \u201cThe way individuals make decisions is often driven by our short-term needs, the here and now, and we struggle to adhere to positive long-term decisions like saving for retirement and investing back into ourselves,\u201d he said. Still, it is dangerous to complete avoid these conversations, he added. \u201cThe lack of focus on retirement and financial wellness in the debates and in D.C. today is putting a whole future generation at risk.\u201d\n\nThe candidates could have also talked about other issues facing older Americans, including preparing for retirement, quality of life, familial caregiving during a generational shift and homelessness among the elderly, Downey said.\n\nNot only could those conversations help inform older Americans, but it could help win votes on Election Day. \u201cIf you look at trends over the last decade or so, they [older Americans] tend to vote Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if I was a Democratic candidate, this is an opportunity to talk about making older adults\u2019 lives better.\u201d", "description": "Avoiding conversations about these topics is \u2018dangerous\u2019", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT460_fourth_ZG_20191016171646.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
