In hindsight, it is striking how little discussion we had in the reform community about how these efforts did or did not address the needs of kids who were excelling, or how these initiatives were landing on non-disadvantaged communities\u2014places where parents liked things just as they were.\n\nThat lack of self-reflection led to a decade of humbling for reformers: the sudden emergence of the \u201copt-out\u201d movement against testing; the political backlash against No Child Left Behind, teacher-evaluation reform, and Common Core; and the painful realization that the passionate but imprudent college-for-all mind-set devalued non-college paths into the workforce and contributed to gobsmacking levels of student debt. These examples should have revealed to the sometimes self-certain reform community that, because public education is a democratic enterprise, an education-policy agenda should address the needs and interests of all families. Put more bluntly, reformers should be able to give a convincing answer to the question, \u201cWhat does your plan have to offer my child?\u201d no matter who asks.\n\nFor entirely too long, policy has been incapable of addressing that question when posed by the parents of high-performing kids.\n\nUnlike in other important education areas, the federal government, as reported by the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC), \u201cdoes not provide guidance or have requirements for gifted services.\u201d Uncle Sam\u2019s sole dedicated gifted program, the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program, was appropriated just $12 million in 2019. The federal government\u2019s Title I, Part A program, which provides funding to districts for low-income students, was appropriated nearly $16 billion in 2019.\n\nAs a result, high-achieving students depend on state and local policy and practice. But a 2015 study by NAGC and the Council of State Directors of Programs for the Gifted (CSDPG) highlighted the \u201clack of centralized data collection, measurement, and accountability to systematically monitor and improve the service of students with gifts, talents, and unidentified potential in our public schools.\u201d The report found that \u201cmany states lack basic data about gifted students and teachers around which quality programs can be built.\u201d So although the federal government estimates that about 6 percent of students are in gifted-and-talented programs, it\u2019s not clear what to make of that number.\n\nOf the 40 states responding to the NAGC/CSDPG survey, 32 reported some kind of state-level mandate on identifying or serving gifted students. Worse, only 17 states require that gifted services be provided in all K\u201312 grades. Four states only required that gifted students be identified\u2014with no requirement to serve them. Twelve states reported no state funding to districts for gifted education. In fact, more than half of states had less than one full-time staff member devoted to gifted education (state departments of education typically have hundreds of employees).", "description": "Gifted education puts in tension two equally treasured American ideals: egalitarianism and individualism.", "authors": ["Andy Smarick", "Author Of"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_514870124/facebook.jpg?1570653447", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
