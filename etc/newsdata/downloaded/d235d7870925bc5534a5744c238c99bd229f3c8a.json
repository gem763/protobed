Park First denied it did anything illegal.\n\nProbe: Park First entrepreneur Toby Whittaker is being investigated by the Government's Insolvency Service over another alleged \u00a3206m investment scam involving storage units\n\nBut former pensions minister Baroness Altmann called for 'tighter regulation' of the investment industry and said those operating scams appeared to be 'laughing at regulators'.\n\nThe row follows the collapse of savings firm London Capital and Finance \u2013 founded by Simon Hume-Kendall \u2013 and the implosion of Neil Woodford's investment empire, leaving savers nursing heavy losses.\n\nThe FCA is seeking compensation through from Park First for around 4,500 investors, many elderly, who were persuaded to put their money in an 'illegal' airport car parking scheme.\n\nSavers parted with \u00a3230million in total \u2013 or an average of more than \u00a351,000 each. Many used their self-invested personal pensions to put money in the scheme, which involved buying car park spaces at Gatwick and Glasgow airports and then leasing them back to the company.\n\nSome of the victims are suing Whittaker in a push for \u00a36million in compensation. The FCA said the airport parking scheme was 'promoted to the public using false or misleading statements'.\n\nInvestors were promised a guaranteed return of up to 12 per cent a year.\n\nThe watchdog said the savers were also told they had received a bargain and that the parking spaces were worth 25 per cent more than they had paid for them.\n\nFormer LCF boss Simon Hume-Kendall, left, and disgraced fund manger Neil Woodford, right\n\nAfter the returns they were promised dried up, investors have been left with airport car parking spaces they claim are impossible to sell.\n\nThe FCA stopped Whittaker and his fellow directors from marketing the scheme in 2016.\n\nBut instead of shutting them down it allowed them to give investors the chance to get their money back or put it in another unregulated airport car parking scheme.\n\nThe firms could not honour their promises and four of those involved collapsed into administration in July. Several others \u2013 such as Park First \u2013 are still operating and are now facing legal action.\n\nJames Daley of consumer group Fairer Finance said: 'If the FCA is not there to protect consumers then what is it there for?'\n\nFirms have to be regulated by the FCA to run so-called 'collective investment schemes' where customers' savings are pooled and then invested.\n\nBut Park First was not authorised to run such a scheme. The FCA is seeking an injunction against the defendants \u2013 Whittaker and fellow director John Slater \u2013 to stop them operating similar schemes in future.\n\nPark First still advertises car parking investment schemes at Gatwick, Luton and Glasgow airports. There is no suggestion that these schemes are illegal.\n\nWhittaker, who lives in a \u00a31.9million home in Burnley, is also being investigated by officials over another alleged scam.\n\nA High Court case was brought in April by the Government's Insolvency Service over an unregulated \u00a3206million 'storage pod' scheme established by another of his companies, Store First.\n\nAround 6,600 investors \u2013 again many of them pensioners \u2013 were persuaded to invest in storage units and promised high returns from renting them out, which never materialised.\n\nThe court heard savers were lured into investing their money by 'misleading information and testimonials'.\n\nThe Government pushed for Store First and related firms to be wound up to protect investors. It also called for Whittaker to be barred as a company director.\n\nA spokesman for Park First said: 'Park First does not accept that the parking schemes that it operates were illegal collective investment schemes.'", "description": "In the latest scandal to rock the investment industry, the Financial Conduct Authority has launched legal action against a string of firms including Park First and their bosses.", "authors": ["James Burton For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
