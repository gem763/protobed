She even once bought an extra apartment, should she need the space.\n\nHowever, the longtime talk show host, whose platform let her see \"the depth of responsibility and sacrifice\" it takes to be a mother, soon changed her tune.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY CONSIDERING MOVING TO CANADA: SOURCE\n\n\u201cI realized, \u2018Whoa, I\u2019m talking to a lot of messed-up people, and they are messed up because they had mothers and fathers who were not aware of how serious that job is,'\u201d said the media mogul, who has also produced and acted to great acclaim over the years. \u201cI don\u2019t have the ability to compartmentalize the way I see other women do. It is why, throughout my years, I have had the highest regard for women who choose to be at home [with] their kids, because I don\u2019t know how you do that all day long. Nobody gives women the credit they deserve.\u201d\n\nWinfrey also noted that her 17-hour days held her back, and that her dogs and Graham allowed her to be herself.\n\nThe \"Color Purple\" and \"A Wrinkle in Time\" star did note, however, that a marriage with Graham would have been rocky.\n\nNIKKI BELLA REVEALS STEAMY DETAILS ABOUT 'AMAZING SEX LIFE' WITH BOYFRIEND ARTEM CHIGVINTSEV\n\n\u201cBoth he and I now say, \u2018If we had married, we would not be together,'\u201d she said. \u201cNo question about it \u2014 we would not stay married, because of what that would have meant to him, and I would have had my own ideas about it.\u201d\n\nAlthough some may consider them unconventional, Winfrey stands by both of her decisions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI have not had one regret about [not having kids or getting married]. I also believe that part of the reason why I don\u2019t have regrets is because I got to fulfill it in the way that was best for me: the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa,\u201d she said. \u201cThose girls fill that maternal fold that I perhaps would have had. In fact, they overfill \u2014 I\u2019m overflowed with maternal.\u201d", "description": "Oprah Winfrey is opening up about her choices to never marry or have children.", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/oprah-winfrey-stedman-graham-reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
