A number of patients had previously contacted the agency to complain of health problems believed to be associated with receiving implants, from arthritis to muscle pain and fatigue.\n\nIn March, experts told the FDA it was too soon to ban certain types of implants, asking for more research to determine risks posed to patients.\n\nSome studies reported a rare form of lymphoma was discovered in scar tissue that develops around surgically-enhanced breasts, estimating that it occurred in as many as 1 in 3,000 women.\n\nAbout 400,000 women get implants every year in the U.S., and about 100,000 of them elect to do so after cancer surgery.\n\nWhile some experts argued pulling textured implants would be an \u201cextraordinary overreaction,\u201d not everyone agreed.\n\nA representative for consumers believed the risk was high enough: \u201cThey need to be taken off the market.\u201d\n\nThe FDA last pulled silicone gel implants shelves in 1992 amid concerns they could cause breast cancer and lupus. But after a number of studies were published, regulators allowed their use again in 2006.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The health agency is asking manufacturers to add a warning to information marketed to patients.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/breastimplant.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
