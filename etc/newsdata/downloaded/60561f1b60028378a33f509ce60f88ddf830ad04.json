PG&E Price Targets Reflect Uncertain Outlook On Wall Street", "language": "en", "text": "PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) shares were hammered Thursday after a bankruptcy judge ruled that PG&E will not have exclusive rights to propose a chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, opening the door for alternative plans from bondholders.\n\nThe ruling is a blow for common shareholders and means that there will be at least two options for navigating bankruptcy moving forward. PG&E\u2019s plan focuses on using debt and equity financing to shield shareholders during bankruptcy. The bondholder plan involves using the majority of PG&E\u2019s equity to pay off the company\u2019s debts.\n\nThe stock traded lower by 28.31% to $7.88 per share in Thursday's afternoon market.\n\nSee Also: PG&E Plummets After Bankruptcy Judge Allows For Rival Chapter 11 Exit Plan\n\nAnalysts React\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd said it\u2019s difficult to recommend buying PG&E stock at this point given the extreme uncertainty and wide range of potential outcomes.\n\n\u201cKey near-term catalysts are mixed in our view and we still see a very wide range of potential values for the stock,\u201d Byrd wrote in a note.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s bear-case scenario target for PG&E is just $1, while its bull case target is $40.\n\nBank of America analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith said the judge\u2019s ruling puts pressure on PG&E to negotiate a deal with wildfire victims to gain their support in the process.\n\n\u201cThe latest order brings incremental uncertainty and chaos to the process and is a clear negative,\u201d Dumoulin-Smith wrote in a note.\n\nHe said the potential for competing bids creates significant risk for existing shareholders.\n\nThe ruling was bearish enough for Citi analyst Praful Mehtah to downgrade PG&E shares from Neutral to Sell, according to StreetInsider. Mehtah reportedly said the stock now has the potential to trade all the way down to $0 in the worst-case bankruptcy scenario.\n\nBenzinga\u2019s Take\n\nUntil there is a clear plan for bankruptcy, valuing PG&E common stock is a shot in the dark. Morgan Stanley\u2019s bull case target of $40 and Citi\u2019s bear case target pf $0 is indicative of just how uncertain PG&E\u2019s outlook is at this point.\n\nDo you agree with this take?
