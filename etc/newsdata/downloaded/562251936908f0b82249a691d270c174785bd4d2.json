Calling runway models \u201clong-starved terrified teenager\u201d is extremely offensive.\n\n'From someone that is always preaching for body positivity this just screams hypocrisy,' Sampaio said.\n\nJamil responded and noted that she never used the term 'all models' in her tweet, but continued that Sampaio was 'living in a bubble' if she wasn't aware of the phenomenon of young girls indeed starving themselves in order to fit into smaller sizes.\n\nSay cheese! Sampaio posed alongside Imaan Hammam and Ugbad Abdi at the dinner table\n\nThe actress took to Twitter to make a second statement bashing the fashion industry even further, stating: 'I talk about moving away from all talk of body, in order to combat our current pervasive issue of eating disorder culture, which is in NO small way perpetuated by the extreme thinness demanded of girls by the high fashion powers that be.'\n\nTheir spat kept on even longer, with Sampaio responding that eating disorders aren't 'exclusive problems of models,' but rather something that society deals with on the whole.\n\nSampaio then made an attempt to simmer down the waters, saying: 'This is the last I\u2019ll say on this. Your constant condescending tone is just unnecessary, and makes it impossible to actual have a conversation. Hope you have a nice life. Wish you all the best.'\n\nThe first one: It all began on Sunday when the Good Place star and body positivity advocate tweeted a viral video of models dancing on the Colours of Africa runway during a Vienna Fashion Week show in 2018\n\nBut Jamil wasn't having it, as she then began to target Sampaio's association with Victoria's Secret, which she called a 'transphobic, fat phobic company.'\n\n'Victoria\u2019s Secret is a brand that sets out to exclude most women, so I would check yourself on that before you start policing me for calling out an industry wide epidemic of harm to young girls,' Jamil said.\n\nSampaio replied: 'I proudly work for a company that has made mistakes and that understands that and has been working on changing that, just like you have made big mistakes in the pass [sic] too. I\u2019m also not someone that is going to resource on personal attacks to try to win some stupid twitter feud!'\n\nThe last one: Jamil fired back with a final tweet challenging the model to keep her activism up\n\nJamil fired back with a final tweet challenging the model to keep her activism up.\n\n'If you\u2019re speaking out against what your company did then GREAT,' Jamil said.\n\n'I look forward to seeing your activism on that with your big profile. You seem passionate about speaking out. So best of luck to you on helping young girls and trans people in this business.'", "description": "She's a Victoria's Secret Angel by day.
