(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo )\n\nHunter Biden denied in a recent interview that his business dealings in Ukraine and China constituted an unethical conflict of interest due to his father\u2019s former position as vice president.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don\u2019t believe now, when I look back on it \u2014 I know that there was \u2014 did nothing wrong at all,\u201d said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is\u2026a swamp in\u2014in\u2014in many ways? Yeah,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC News\u2019 Amy Robach in an exclusive interview that was recorded over the weekend and aired Tuesday morning.\n\nWhile he maintained that none of his business dealings crossed an ethical boundary, he admitted that his actions played into the hands of his father\u2019s political enemies.\n\n\u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden was a paid board member of a Ukrainian natural gas company and an unpaid board member of a Chinese investment firm during the time Joe Biden was Vice President.\n\nPresident Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have accused the Bidens of improper conduct.\n\nIn Ukraine, Hunter Biden\u2019s company Burisma Holdings was under investigation by former prosecutor general Victor Shokin, who was himself accused of corruption. In 2016 Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin at the behest of U.S. and European Union officials.\n\nHunter Biden announced on Sunday that he would step down from the board of the Chinese firm BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co. In 2013 the Chinese government invested $1.5 billion in the company after Hunter flew to China on Air Force Two with his father. Hunter owns a ten percent stake in the company, and his announcement included no mention of how he would use the investment.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is the subject of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, who allege the President may have pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens by withholding military aid from the country.", "description": "\"I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father.
