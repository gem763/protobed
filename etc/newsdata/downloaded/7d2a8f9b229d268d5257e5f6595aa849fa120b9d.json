And while leopard are less frequently seen, their presence is well known,\" the Park says.\n\nSt Lucia resident Larina Joubert recently caught a photo of an elusive leopard on the town\u2019s streets, which she shared on Facebook. Imagine driving out your property and finding a leopard just around the corner! Check out the image:\n\nLeopard on St Lucia's streets.

It is truly iconic.\u201d\n\nVisitors and residents must be vigilant\n\n\"With a predominantly international visitor population, especially at this time of year, as well as animals seeking their natural food close to human habitation in the leaner winter months, we remind visitors to be very vigilant when walking in town or in the forested areas to avoid any negative encounters,\" says Zaloumis.\n\n\"Wild animals have lived here since time immemorial. They remain wild and are potentially dangerous defending their territory and young. The rule of thumb is to give them as wide a berth as possible, whether on foot or in a vehicle,\" he says.\n\nZaloumis advises people to be especially aware of hippo and says \"if you must walk in town at night, use a powerful torch. Do not at any time be tempted to enter the estuary water. It is the crocodile you can\u2019t see that poses the greatest risk.\"\n\nSEE: iSimangaliso comfort zone: Man versus wild\n\niSimangaliso Wetland Park also asks people to report any potentially dangerous or unlawful situations, snares, feeding of wildlife or provocation of animals to the 24-hour emergency line: 082 797 7944.\n\nWhat to read next on Traveller24:\n\n- EXCLUSIVE PICS: SA's #CodeClimbers share their fascinating record-breaking nine peaks adventure\n\n- #VisitWestCoast: Exploring from Saldanha to Langebaan\n\n- Berlin eKapa Festival 2017: What you need to know", "description": "A privilege of living in or visiting the Lake St Lucia Estuary is the abundance of wildlife that roams freely throughout the estuarine forests bordering the village of St Lucia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4128/033f281a5dcd4046b2f5a47c9af8fa52.jpg", "published_at": "2017-07-26"}
