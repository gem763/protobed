This was the wrong call,\u201d says the petition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOh, no it wasn\u2019t, responds the Crimson, a student daily in its 146th year. A note to readers from Crimson President Kristine E. Guillaume and Managing Editor Angela N. Fu reads, in part, \u201cThe Crimson exists because of a belief that an uninformed campus would be a poorer one \u2014 that our readers have the right to be informed about the place where they live, work, and study. In pursuit of that goal, we seek to follow a commonly accepted set of journalistic standards, similar to those followed by professional news organizations big and small.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommonly accepted\u201d understates the matter: Go ahead and dial up anyone in the field of journalism \u2014 reporters, editors, professors, whoever \u2014 and try to get them to endorse a policy of not seeking comment from the target of a protest. Fairness is merely the beginning of the imperative: \u201cWhat if the story ends up saying something false about ICE or someone else mentioned in the article? A failure to investigate can be evidence of negligence in a defamation suit if something turns out to be wrong,\u201d notes Clay Calvert, a University of Florida professor often consulted by the Erik Wemple Blog.\n\nIn their petition, campus activists allege a \u201clong history\u201d at ICE of \u201csurveilling and retaliating against those who speak out against them.\u201d A former journalist at the Crimson tweeted:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYeah this was a major bad move on The Crimson\u2019s part, and I say this as a previous editor.\n\n\n\nHow many government agencies do Harvard affiliates protest in some way on a weekly basis? How many of them get contacted for comment? https://t.co/KIHzySRdIP \u2014 Brandon Dixon (@BrandonJoDixon) September 17, 2019\n\nTo underscore its point about the implications of protesting ICE, the petition links to three stories about the agency\u2019s pursuit of immigration activists. The first of those cited stories comes from Vice, under the headline, \u201cICE Keeps Arresting Prominent Immigration Activists. They Think They\u2019re Being Targeted.\u201d The story quotes Alina Das, co-director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at NYU Law School: \u201cThis is definitely a marked shift from past policies where people\u2019s involvement in immigrants\u2019 rights, civil rights, and labor rights was recognized as a reason for a person to not be targeted. \u2026 That activism was, at minimum, respected, and certainly was not a basis for targeting people.\u201d\n\nThe story also contains this bit of reporting: \u201cICE did not respond to VICE News\u2019 request for comment.\u201d\n\nWhich is to say that the main story cited by the activist groups to support its call not to seek comment from ICE seeks comment from ICE. Another piece flagged by the activist groups includes actual pushback from ICE.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Crimson\u2019s decision to request comment from ICE, argues the petition, \u201cis virtually the same as tipping them off, regardless of how they are contacted.\u201d Bolding is original. Yet the Crimson persuasively rebuts any tip-off claim, pointing out in the note to readers:\n\nIn The Crimson\u2019s communication with ICE\u2019s media office, the reporters did not provide the names or immigration statuses of any individual at the protest. We did not give ICE forewarning of the protest, nor did we seek to interfere with the protest as it was occuring. Indeed, it is The Crimson\u2019s practice to wait until a protest concludes before asking for comment from the target of the protest \u2014 a rule which was followed here. The Crimson\u2019s outreach to ICE only consisted of public information and a broad summary of protestors\u2019 criticisms. As noted in the story, ICE did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a notable wrinkle, the petition doesn\u2019t criticize the Crimson for actually covering the rally and publishing the names of the protesters. It limits itself to comment outreach. The implication here is that the protesters were content to have their names and comments enter the public record via the Crimson, while pounding the publication for seeking a general comment regarding the protest.\n\nTo punish the Crimson for informing its community, Act on a Dream is urging other groups to shun its inquiries:\n\nAD\n\nWe call on our peers and fellow student organizations to boycott @thecrimson and decline any interviews or requests for comment until they change their reckless policy that requires calling ICE in their reporting. \u2014 Act on a Dream (@actonadream) October 19, 2019\n\nThere are signs that the campaign is working: A follow-up story in the Crimson about the controversy, for instance, cites a lack of cooperation from key players: \u201cSeven of the organizations that signed the petition also declined to comment for this story,\u201d notes the piece. Act on a Dream didn\u2019t respond to the Crimson\u2019s inquiries.\n\nAD\n\nThere was a time when reporters got in trouble for failing to seek comment from the other side. That there\u2019s a petition out there with 680-plus signatures shaming a student newspaper for doing things the proper way extends an argument that dates back to the early Trump days \u2014 namely, that President Trump himself and associates such as Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Sanders shouldn\u2019t be interviewed on live television and the like because of their tendency to spew falsehoods and just lie. It\u2019s a tempting proposition until you consider that key officials \u2014 most recently, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who admitted a Ukraine-related quid pro quo last week \u2014 are prone to admitting their malfeasance when called upon to defend it.\n\nSeeking comment from a corrupt administration, accordingly, is an act of patriotism. Keep reporting, Crimson.\n\nAD", "description": "One line in a Sept. 13 story has prompted a backlash: 'ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.'", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7z7xmeEd-XqtN5bros76vnDARF8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HO45VYHVWQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
