Beto O\u2019Rourke, describing the toll of gun violence, forged a moment more poignant than any of hers. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker had better one-liners. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s beautifully shaped final answer put hers, delivered just a few minutes earlier, almost immediately out of my mind.\n\nBut Warren demonstrated precisely why she has been on an upward trajectory in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination and why that trajectory is likely to continue.\n\nShe showed how canny she can be. How cunning.\n\nCriticism came her way, and she brushed it off like so much lint.\n\nPerhaps most crucially, she was evasive, which isn\u2019t a noble quality but is as essential as any other when you\u2019re running for office. Idealism puts you in play. Slipperiness gets you the prize.", "description": "The debate showed that she\u2019s slick, which may mean she\u2019s unstoppable.", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/opinion/13bruniWeb/13bruniWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
