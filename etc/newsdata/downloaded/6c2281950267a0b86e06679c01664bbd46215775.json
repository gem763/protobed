[Although] this is not about trying to create geriatric pregnancies.\u2019\n\nAngie, 67, admitted she loved the idea of delaying menopause but said women should try to opt for natural ways.\n\n\u2018It sounds fabulous, I love anything to help with the ageing process but for me, something natural. If women take responsibility for their own individual bodies, the idea of there being such an invasive surgery to take out a piece of my ovary \u2013 only a man would come up with this,\u2019 she argued.\n\nHowever, Fisher said he has taken the lead from two female professors on developing the surgery, stating: \u2018Women are part of our medical science here.\u2019\n\nAngie replied: \u2018It sounds like a fantastic thing for someone who has problems with fertility, a problem with cancer, but for an ordinary woman going through menopause, it is just not necessary to have an invasive surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Menopause is the same as puberty but on the other end of the scale.\n\n\u2018Learn how to manage your hormones, learn why your hormones get out of kilter and you can do it yourself.\u2019\n\nHowever, Angie earned a strong reaction from viewers when she went on to describe the menopause process as an \u2018amazing time\u2019.\n\n\u2018Babes, the menopause is an amazing time for a woman. You get rid of those daft hormones that make you crazy, jealous and emotional. You have no more periods, you are free. All of a sudden you feel wise and wonderful \u2013 well I do anyway,\u2019 she said.\n\nAngie thinks natural methods should be used to delay menopause (Picture: ITV)\n\nFisher argued that the surgery is \u2018not that invasive\u2019, stating: \u2018It\u2019s keyhole surgery. It\u2019s done everyday on women, all over the world. We know from our cancer patients that 95% of women\u2026\u2019\n\nBut Angie interrupted him and snapped: \u2018Simon, stop. Stop using cancer and menopause in the same [sentence].\u2019\n\nReacting to the debate, one GMB viewer quipped: \u2018Delaying #brexit now delaying the menopause and it\u2019s not even the 1st of April.\u2019\n\nDisagreeing with Angie\u2019s views on menopause, another chimed in: \u2018Wouldn\u2019t say the menopause is an amazing time Ang.\u2019\n\nAnother wondered: \u2018What plant is she on. There\u2019s nothing \u2018wonderful\u2019 about the menopause!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018F**k that. I\u2019d rather go through the menopause at 50 than at 70!!!!!!\u2019 another stated.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
