It's really a great day for civilization. It's a great day for civilization,' Trump said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence announced the United States and Turkey reached a deal to suspend Ankara's operations in northern Syria for five days to allow Kurds time to withdraw to a 'safe zone' as part of a cease-fire agreement.\n\n'The United States and Turkey have agreed to a cease-fire in Syria,' Pence announced at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara after protracted negotiations with the Turkish government.\n\nPence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spent more than four hours meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other officials in order to get a deal in a mission that had long odds with several Trump administration officials worried they wouldn't get an agreement.\n\nThe deal establishes a 20-mile buffer zone on the Turkish border that Kurds would have to avoid - a move that essentially gives Turkey a portion of Syria to control.\n\nTrump praised his team's work and touted his own role in the matter.\n\n'They couldn't get it without a little rough love,' Trump said in Texas after the deal was announced. The president had threatened Erdogan about the deal, saying he would destroy the Turkish economy with sanctions if he didn't sign on. 'This is an incredible outcome.'\n\nBut Turkish officials down played the agreement, saying they agreed to suspend operations to let the Kurds withdraw and emphasized it was 'not a ceasefire.'\n\n'We will suspend the Peace Spring operation for 120 hours for the PKK/YPG to withdraw. This is not a ceasefire,' Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence announced the United States and Turkey have reached a deal to suspend Ankara's operations in northern Syria for five day\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the deal would not have gotten done without 'tough love'\n\nTurkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters gesture as they stand at a back of a truck in the border town of Tal Abyad, Syria\n\nTrump infuriated members of both political parties - including some of his strongest Republican allies - when he announced earlier this month he was withdrawing U.S. troops from Northern Syria.\n\nHe was accused of abandoning the Kurds, who are U.S. allies in the region, and ceding control of the area to Russia.\n\nA week of criticism from Capitol Hill compounded on Wednesday into a White House meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers where Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of having a 'serious meltdown' when talking about the issue.\n\nBut the president gloried in the agreement on Thursday, calling Erdogan a 'hell of a leader.'\n\nVice President Pence outlined the details of the agreement, saying Turkey agreed five-day cease fire in order to let Kurds get out of the 'safe zone' and Turkey will have a buffer zone around its border that the Kurds will avoid.\n\n'Once that is completed, Turkey has agreed to a permanent ceasefire,' the vice president said.\n\nAnd he said that Kurdish fighters would honor the deal even as the Kurdish were not part of the negotiations.\n\n'We have repeated assurances from them that they will be going out,' he said.\n\nThe deal includes a Kurdish withdrawal from a security zone roughly 20 miles south of the Turkish border, which Pence said the Kurds will comply with.\n\n'Our administration has already been in contact with Syria defense forces and we've already begun to facilitate their safe withdrawal from the nearly 20-mile-wide safe zone area south of the Turkish border in Syria,' Pence noted.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan meets with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (3rd R), National Security Adviser Robert C. O'Brien (2nd R) and the American Ambassador to Turkey James Jeffrey (not pictured)\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the agreement was 'not a cease fire'\n\nSmoke and fire in the town of Ras al-Ain in Syria as Turkish forces gain ground there\n\n'We recognize the importance and value of a safe zone to create a buffer between Syria proper and the Kurdish population and the Turkish border,' he said.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. agreed to lift the economic sanctions it imposed on Turkey after the country sent troops into northern Syria once American forces had withdrawn.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. troops resulted in the Turkish military going ahead with a planned invasion into northeastern Syria, where Kurdish fighters had helped American forces in fighting what was left of ISIS.\n\n'The United States will not impose any further sanctions on Turkey,' Pence announced.\n\n'And once a permanent cease fire is in effect, the president has agreed to withdraw the economic sanctions that were imposed this last Monday,' he added.\n\nBut the agreement, however, gives Turkey what it wanted with its military incursion Additionally, the country is under no obligation to withdraw its troops under the agreement.\n\nAnd the sanctions relief means the country will suffer no economic penalty from its military operation.\n\nTrump, however, argued the deal will save lives and praised Turkey for signing it.\n\n'They're not going to have to kill millions of people, and millions of people aren't going to have to kill them,' he said.\n\nThe president acknowledged the opposition to his decision to withdraw U.S. troops , including criticism he faced in his party from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and his longtime ally Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\n'This outcome is something they've been trying to get for ten years, everybody, and they couldn't get it. Other administrations, and they never would have been able to get it unless you went somewhat unconventional. I guess I'm an unconventional person. I took a lot of heat from a lot of people even some of the people in my own party, but they were there, in the end they were there. They're all there. Look, this is about the nation. This isn't about Republicans or Democrats. This is about our nation,' Trump said.\n\nHe claimed the Kurds were very happy with the outcome.\n\n'They were incredibly happy with this solution. This is a solution that really - well it saved their lives, frankly. It saved their lives,' he said.\n\nBut not all Republicans celebrated the president's deal.\n\nIn a scathing speech on the Senate floor, GOP Sen. Mitt Romney slammed the agreement, saying 'the cease-fire does not change the fact that America has abandoned an ally, adding insult to dishonor.'\n\n'The administration speaks cavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty. Their homes have been burned and their families have been torn apart,' he added.\n\n'What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history,' he said.\n\nRepublican Senator Mitt Romney slammed Trump's deal with Turkey as a 'bloodstain' on America\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan receives Vice President Mike Pence at Presidential Complex in Ankara\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he wants 'something even stronger' than the House resolution condemning Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria as Republicans have opposed the president's move\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, called for even greater sanctions on Turkey\n\nTurkish-backed Syrian fighters drive down a street in the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad\n\nThere were fears among some Trump administration officials that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence would not be able to get a deal with Turkey\n\nGraham said in a statement on Thursday he had a phone call with Trump, who spoke to him from Air Force One as he was in route to Dallas, Texas, after the deal was done.\n\n'Sounds like we may have made real progress regarding a cease-fire and hopefully sustainable solutions to prevent the reemergence of ISIS, the abandonment of our ally, the Kurds, and other strategic interests of the United States, like the containment of Iran,' Graham said.\n\n'I stand ready to continue working with the President to build upon this breakthrough. I also stand ready to work in a bipartisan fashion to ensure this incursion by Turkey into northeastern Syria ends, hopefully, in a win-win fashion,' he said. 'Turkey has legitimate national security concerns within Syria but they cannot be met by invasion and force of arms.'\n\nBut there are still signs of dissension among the Republican ranks.\n\nMcConnell said Thursday he wants 'something even stronger' in the Senate than a House's resolution that condemned Trump's decision to with draw U.S. troops from Syria.\n\n'I believe it's important that we make a strong forward-looking strategic statement. For that reason my preference would be for something even stronger than the resolution that the House passed yesterday which has some serious weaknesses,' McConnell said from the Senate floor.\n\nBut nothing was raining on Trump's parade.\n\nFollowing the news of the deal, Trump tweeted: 'Great news out of Turkey. News Conference shortly with @VP and @SecPompeo . Thank you to @RTErdogan . Millions of lives will be saved!'\n\nVice President Mike Pence met with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan at the Presidential Palace in Ankara Thursday for more than four hours\n\nPresident Trump tweeted the deal was 'great news'\n\nA Syrian woman and a girl, who were displaced by the Turkish military operation in northeastern Syria, wait to receive a tent and other aid supplies at the Bardarash refugee camp, north of Mosul, Iraq\n\nThe president went on to tweet: 'This deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some 'tough' love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all!'\n\nHe added that millions of lives will be saved.\n\n'This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this 'Deal' for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!,' the president wrote.\n\nThe vice president touched down in Ankara earlier Thursday alongside Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien as they tried to stop the Syrian civil war descending into a bloody new phase.\n\nHis mission came a day after the White House released a letter Trump sent to Erdogan, urging him to make a deal.\n\n'You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering people,' Trump wrote, adding: 'Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool! I will call you later.'\n\nThe outlook for any deal had appeared bleak after Erdogan briefly toyed with the idea of refusing to meet with Pence at all.\n\nHe later relented, but repeatedly insisted he will not stop his assault on the Kurds - America's former allies in Syria - until he has driven them away from his border.\n\nTrump praised Erdogan for signing on to the agreement.\n\n'He's a hell of a leader. And he's a tough man. He's a strong man. And he did the right thing, and I really appreciate it, and I will appreciate it in the future,' he said Thursday.\n\nHe said - with the deal in place - Erdogan will likely make his visit to the White House next month.\n\n'That would be very much open. I would say, yeah, he would come. He did a terrific thing. He's a leader. He had to make a decision. A lot of people wouldn't have made that decision because they don't know. They ultimately would have made it, but what he did was very smart and it was great for the people of Turkey, and they're lucky it was him making the decision, I will tell you that,' he said.\n\nTrump told reporters during a press conference Wednesday that he hadn't given Erdogan 'a green light' to invade northern Syria, and claimed releasing 'a very powerful letter' would dispel misconceptions about the impact of his troop withdrawal from Syria days.\n\n'If anybody saw the letter, which can be released very easily if you'd like \u2013 I could certainly release it,' he said.\n\n'But I wrote a letter right after that conversation \u2013 a very powerful letter. There was never given a green light.'\n\nVice President Mike Pence carries details of the agreement as he prepares to announce the deal\n\nSyrian National Army (SNA) members hang a Syrian National Army flag as they continue operations against the PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the EU, and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey regards as a terror group, within Turkey's Operation Peace Spring\n\nCorrespondence: The letter reveals how Trump asked Erdogan not to invade northern Syria\n\nThe letter appears to support the president's contention that he didn't give Erdogan his approval for the military campaign.\n\n'Let's work out a good deal!' he wrote. 'You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy\u2014and I will.'\n\nThe president pledged during the 2016 campaign to disentangle America's military from what he called 'forever wars' \u2013 longstanding conflicts that the Pentagon has stabilized, often with thousands, or tens of thousands, of servicemen and women.\n\nHe used that pledge to justify his withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.\n\nTrump's allies in his own party, including Lindsey Graham, turned on him with that decision.\n\nGraham, who has been a Trump ally in fending off the Russia probe, blasted the president for abandoning Kurdish allies in Syria in an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, where evangelical leaders have been voicing concern about the risk to minorities including Christians in the region.\n\n'I will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump's worst nightmare,' Graham vowed. 'I will not sit along the sidelines and watch a good ally, the Kurds, be slaughtered by Turkey.'\n\nGraham cautioned: 'This is a defining moment for President Trump. He needs to up his game.'\n\nTrump responded by claiming the Kurds are not 'angels.'\n\n'Syria has a relationship with the Kurds \u2013 who by the way are not angels,' Trump told reporters at the White House Wednesday.\n\n'Who is an angel? There aren't too many around. But Syria has a relationship with the Kurds. So they'll come in for their border. And they'll fight,' Trump said.\n\nGraham on Thursday called for stricter sanctions against Turkey and introduced legislation that would target Turkish officials, end U.S. military cooperation with the NATO ally and mandate sanctions over Turkey's purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system\n\n'Congress is going to speak with a very firm, singular voice, that we will impose sanctions in the strongest measure possible against this Turkish outrage that will lead to the re-emergence of ISIS, the destruction of an ally, the Kurds and eventually benefit to Iran to the detriment of Israel,' he said during a press conference on Capitol Hill.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives voted Wednesday to condemn the president's troop-withdrawal decision, where 129 Republicans joined Democrats to condemn Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria in a 354 to 60 vote.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said hours later that they walked out of a meeting with Trump at the White House when he berated them for their views on Syria.\n\nPelosi said she witnessed a 'meltdown,' with Trump telling her some ISIS fighters were communists, and 'that must make you happy.'\n\nThe White House said in a statement that '[t]he President was measured, factual and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi's decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising.'\n\nThe statement claimed Pelosi 'chose to storm out and get in front of the cameras to whine.'", "description": "Donald Trump hailed an agreement between the U.S. and Turkey for a five-day cease fire in Syria as a 'great day for civilization' as Turkish officials down played the outcome of the deal.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19856846-0-image-a-45_1571345067324.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
