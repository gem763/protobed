In April this year, Donald Trump described Kumgang as an \u201cunbelievable location\u201d but said the time was \u201cnot right\u201d to allow South Koreans to visit.\n\nDespite his criticism of South Korean architecture, Kim said: \u201cWe will always welcome our compatriots from the South if they want to come to Mount Kumgang after it is wonderfully built as the world-level tourist destination.\u201d\n\nKim also criticised his \u201cpredecessors\u201d \u2013 believed to be a veiled reference to his father, Kim Jong-il \u2013 for encouraging the South to invest in Kumgang. \u201cHe made a sharp criticism of the very wrong, dependent policy of the predecessors who were going to rely on others when the country was not strong enough,\u201d KCNA said.\n\nThe North Korean leader is promoting tourism as a key component of his policy of \u201cself-reliant\u201d economic growth. An editorial in the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said: \u201cThe entire people should cherish the belief that self-reliance is the only way to live. There is nothing more foolish than to expect help from others today.\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s pitch for self-reliance came as the UN warned that food insecurity in North Korea was at an \u201calarming level\u201d, with nearly 11 million people undernourished. Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN\u2019s independent investigator on human rights in North Korea said an estimated 140,000 children were suffering from \u201cundernutrition\u201d, including 30,000 who \u201cface an increased risk of death\u201d.", "description": "North Korean ruler demands makeover of joint resort, saying South Korean facilities are like \u2018temporary buildings at construction sites\u2019", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c0dbb9f9d58324b6b795fcd5365c9c20695720d/0_15_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca33147b587aa7e49e0ac10f63b2ab35", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
