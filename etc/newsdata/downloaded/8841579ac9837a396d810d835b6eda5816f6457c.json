The week that could determine how long he remains prime minister -- and how or whether Britain leaves the European Union -- is about to begin.\n\nThe rules of the U.K.\u2019s unwritten constitution are being stretched to the limit, with new precedents being set and cries of foul play arising nearly every day. Johnson\u2019s goal is to stay in power by uniting hard-line Brexit supporters while opponents remain divided.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether he\u2019s overplayed his hand.\n\nThroughout August, different factions among the members of parliament who want to stop Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal have proposed and rejected various plans to stop Johnson from pursuing such a course.\n\nNow they seem to have agreed, with senior figures from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party saying they\u2019re ready to move decisively when Parliament returns on Sept. 3.\n\nLast week, Johnson tried to sabotage opponents by asking the Queen to suspend parliament for a month from Sept. 12 (she agreed). While that reduces the amount of time that MPs have to act -- Britain is set to quit on Oct. 31 -- it\u2019s made wavering politicians realize that they have one shot.\n\nJohnson was due to meet potential Tory rebels on Monday, to persuade them that his plan isn\u2019t to actually pursue a no-deal Brexit, but simply to bluff EU leaders into believing that one is possible. But the talks were called off.\n\nThis week could end with Johnson triumphant, the man with whom the EU is forced to negotiate if it wants to avoid no-deal.\n\nOr it could end with yet another Conservative prime minister humiliated at the hands of his own party, this time with pro-European Tories the ones to take revenge. Or Britain could be on course for yet another election.\n\nThe choice that Johnson tried to frame in an interview with the Sunday Times was less about a deal than about opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental choice is this: are you going to side with Jeremy Corbyn and those who want to cancel the referendum?\u201d he said. \u201cAre you going to side with those who want to scrub the democratic verdict of the people, and plunge this country into chaos?\u201d\n\nThousands of people on Saturday joined protests across the U.K. against the decision to suspend parliament. The demonstrators used the slogan \u201cStop the Coup\u201d to protest the limiting of debate.\n\nSeveral potential rebel Conservative MPs responded angrily over the weekend to reports that they might be expelled from their party if they vote against the government. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond pointed out that several members of Johnson\u2019s Cabinet, including Johnson himself, had voted against the government on European issues earlier this year.\n\nFormer Justice Secretary David Gauke told Sky News on Sunday that sometimes \u201cyou have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest. And the national interest has to come first.\u201d\n\nThe rebels haven\u2019t set out their exact plan, and even if a bill is passed, it\u2019s possible Johnson could try to get round it. Michael Gove, minister in charge of no-deal planning, repeatedly refused to say whether the government would obey such a law.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what the legislation says,\u201d he told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nEarlier in the summer, Labour proposed installing Corbyn as a caretaker leader with a mandate to call an election. That idea was rejected by Conservatives, and though a confidence vote remains a possibility, Gauke said he regarded Corbyn as too much of a risk to be prime minister.\n\nBut some in Labour fear Johnson may try to get Corbyn out of the way by giving him something he wants: a swift election.\n\nJohnson would need the opposition party\u2019s support to call one, but if he had it, he could offer a date before Britain is due to leave. The prime minister has in recent days unveiled billions of pounds of new spending on education, social care and transportation, adding to speculation that he\u2019s preparing for the polls.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair will on Monday urge Corbyn to rule an election out. \u201cIt is counter-intuitive for opposition parties to refuse an election,\u201d he\u2019ll say in a speech in London. \u201cBut in this exceptional case, it is vital they do so as a matter of principle, until Brexit is resolved.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson\u2019s summer is over.
