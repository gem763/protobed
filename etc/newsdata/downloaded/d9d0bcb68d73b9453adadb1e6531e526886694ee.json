Last fall, then-governor Jerry Brown refused to sign the legislation, using talking points similar to those that pro-life groups such as Students for Life of America used when lobbying against the bill.\n\n\u201cAccording to a study sponsored by supporters of this legislation, the average distance to abortion providers in campus communities varies from five to seven miles, not an unreasonable distance,\u201d Brown said in a statement at the time. \u201cBecause the services required by this bill are widely available off-campus, this bill is not necessary.\u201d\n\nEvidently, Newsom disagreed. \u201cAs other states and the federal government go backward, restricting reproductive freedom, in California we are moving forward, expanding access and reaffirming a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d he said in a statement after signing the bill late last week. \u201cWe\u2019re removing barriers to reproductive health, increasing access on college campuses and using technology to modernize how patients interact with providers.\u201d\n\nAccording to the bill, RU-486 will be provided to students by health-care workers at health centers on California campuses. But the drug in question \u2014 Mifeprex, the most common drug used in chemical abortions before about ten weeks\u2019 gestation \u2014 typically is administered at a clinic before the pregnant woman is sent home to expel the developing embryo, a fairly risky process.\n\nThis past April, the Food and Drug Administration updated the adverse effects of Mifeprex to note that as of 2018, \u201cthere were reports of 24 deaths of women associated with Mifeprex since the product was approved in September 2000, including two cases of ectopic pregnancy resulting in death; and several cases of severe systemic infection (also called sepsis), including some that were fatal.\u201d\n\nOfficial documentation on the use of Mifeprex shows that there have been close to 4,200 women who reported adverse effects from the drug, including infections, follow-up surgery, hospitalization, and other complications. Opponents of the legislation in California lobbied against the bill in part because they argued that college-age women in particular need close supervision and will be put at risk by having abortion drugs made available without proper surveillance to ensure their health and safety.\n\nJudging from estimates provided by proponents of S.B. 24, it is likely that somewhere between 15 and 75 young women each month will require surgery after RU-486 fails. Opponents of the bill say it\u2019s unlikely that campus health centers will be adequately prepared to handle such emergencies. Many who lobbied against the bill also noted that the legislation\u2019s provisions will probably require violating the conscience rights of California\u2019s health-care professionals, who easily could be forced to facilitate medical abortions, because S.B. 24 provides no protections for anyone with religious or moral objections to the procedure.\n\nOver the summer, California\u2019s Department of Finance articulated its objections to the legislation, noting that the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls \u201cdoes not have the technical expertise nor existing capacity to develop and administer a program of this size, scope, or content.\u201d\n\nAccording to its report, enacting the new policy would cost University of California\u2013system schools somewhere between $4.6 million and $7.8 million to initiate, with additional ongoing costs of $2.2 million to $3.3 million beginning in 2023 to operate the program. The report didn\u2019t estimate the costs to the California State University system but noted that the CSU had said students\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for RU-486 and related lab work likely would be about $500 because the state hasn\u2019t allocated enough to actually cover the cost.\n\nS.B. 24 will allocate $200,000 each to University of California and California State University health centers \u201cto pay for the cost, both direct and indirect, of medication abortion readiness,\u201d including updated training, new equipment, telemedicine services, and facility upgrades. Pro-abortion group JustCARE reports that private donors including the Women\u2019s Foundation of California and Tara Health Foundation raised $10,290,000 in private money to fund the new policy. Opponents of the legislation note that if the funding is insufficient to account for actual costs of implementing the program on all 34 campuses, the rest of the costs will fall to students.", "description": "Democratic governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation making California the first state in the country to require public colleges and universities to provide medical-abortion pills to students at campus health centers.S.B. 24, or the College Student Right to Access Act, will compel all 34 University", "authors": ["Alexandra Desanctis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UA4XuKh.HH.VQwBiqfz_7A--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/e47d82a929b7289cd20f1a384b9f3b93", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
