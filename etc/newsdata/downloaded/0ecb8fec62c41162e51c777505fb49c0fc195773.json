Here's what you can do to help.\n\nFor some kids, it\u2019s a true sensory issue. Coats feel too heavy or too puffy or too scratchy after several months of soft t-shirts. But to send them off into the wild without any protection from the elements doesn\u2019t feel right either, so it\u2019s time to bust out a few new tactics to make getting out the door in proper attire a little easier.\n\nSome parents in our Offspring Facebook Group had some fresh ideas this week, which I\u2019ve compiled here. (If you haven\u2019t joined yet, this is a great place to go for advice on things like tantrums, potty training, picky eating, school lunches and other parenting challenges.)\n\nTeach them to put it on themselves\n\nYou know that part of why they\u2019re refusing to put on the coat is because you want them to put on the coat. It\u2019s one more thing you are trying to control about their existence, and they\u2019re not having it. Their whole day feels like a series of stuff they don\u2019t feel like doing or eating or wearing and now you want them to wear a coat, too?! To hell with you!\n\nBut the other thing about toddlers is that they are desperate for independence. So even though it\u2019s easier and quicker for you to help them with their coat, teach them how to do it themselves; it will actually save you time you would have spent trying to convince them that you know more about the weather than they do.\n\nWe recommend the flip trick:\n\nCall it something else\n\nAll this time you\u2019ve been saying, \u201cCome put on your coat,\u201d when you could have been saying, \u201cCome put on your magic, hooded cape!\u201d Or another make-believe, special name for it that launches you into some sort of role play situation where they\u2019re a superhero off to save your family from starving (going to the grocery store) or to play with all their superhero friends (kids at daycare).\n\nSometimes adding in a little silliness is all it takes to shake them out of their stubbornness and into a jacket.\n\nCreate a cold weather dress-up area\n\nIf calling the coat \u201cmagical\u201d isn\u2019t convincing enough for them, consider creating a fun cold weather gear station by your front door. This suggestion comes from Heather in our Facebook Group:\n\nMake a little dress-up area for her that has a mirror, a kid-height clothing bar or drawers, and throw a bunch of sweaters and jackets in there with some fun things like cat ear headbands, and just leave them there for her to explore on her own.\n\nSome funky options may be all it takes to get them out of the no-coat rut.\n\nTry a cloak or poncho\n\nSometimes coats can feel very restricting for kids\u2014they might not want to be cold, but they also don\u2019t want to feel like their arms are weighed down. In that case, a cloak or poncho-style might do the trick. Or you could lure them in with a whimsical animal hood and tail.\n\nA vest is another option to give them an extra layer while also keeping the arms free to move.\n\nLet them carry it instead\n\nProbably the most classic advice for dealing with the coat battle is to let them go without it and face the natural consequences of being cold (within reason, of course). Or that you bring it along for when they do decide they want it. But I lean more toward, \u201cYou can wear it or you can carry it.\u201d They can stuff it in their backpack, they could tie it around their waist or carry it in their hands.\n\nThis still makes them responsible for it (you\u2019ve got enough to carry) and they just might find it easier to put it on. But either way, they\u2019re still able to exert some control over the situation.\n\nAlso, remember to be cautious about kids wearing large winter coats in car seats \u2014 the bulky material can cause the straps to be too loose and less effective in a crash. It\u2019s best to have them wear the coat to the car and then take it off, buckle them in and turn the coat backwards for them to put their arms in.\n\nIf it\u2019s not dangerously cold and they\u2019re fighting you on wearing it, you could simply carry it to the car and have them put it on backwards after they\u2019re buckled in and feeling the cold.", "description": "While we're heading towards summer, it's not quite here yet, and the cooler weather can still be a struggle for many reasons, including your unruly toddler who doesn't want to wear their coat outdoors.
