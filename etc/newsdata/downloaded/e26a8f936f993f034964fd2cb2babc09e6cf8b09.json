Using an on-screen interface, employees can find free workstations, find out where their colleagues are and search for work spaces based on air quality, temperature and noise.\n\n\n\nKivinen said that the biggest issue when trying to make buildings more sustainable was \"the current infrastructure, the current hardware that is installed in these buildings.\"\n\n\n\n\"They have been implemented throughout several decades so the systems usually don't actually already communicate with each other,\" he added.\n\nThese developments might have a futuristic feel, but how realistic is it to create a human-centric building that is able to improve the well-being of people inside it?\n\n\n\n\"It absolutely is,\" Derek Clements-Croome, an emeritus professor at the University of Reading, told CNBC. \"We \u2026 are sensory beings, we live through our senses: the look and feel of the place, the colors, the air, the views out of the windows,\" he added. \"All of these things have an effect on our emotions, our physical being, our general positive outlook in the daily life that we lead.\"", "description": "How can technology improve the atmosphere of the offices we work in?", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106187385-1571322075419gettyimages-1150436908.jpeg?v=1571925446", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
