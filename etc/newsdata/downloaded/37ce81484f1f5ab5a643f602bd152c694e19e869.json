Who can hand out the most? Who has the most contempt for capitalism?\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIt's hard to say who\u2019s winning; is it Warren or Sanders? But they are both upping the ante.\n\nLook at Bernie Sanders\u2019 wealth tax plan. He starts confiscating 1 percent of your net worth, annually, if you hit $32 million, and it goes up from there to 8 percent, annually on $10 billion. He hits 180,000 families, and takes $4.3 trillion worth of money out of private hands and gives it to the government over 10 years.\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth plan is tame by comparison. She doesn\u2019t start taxing wealth until you\u2019re worth $50 million. She \u201conly\u201d hits 70,000 families and \u201conly\u201d confiscates $2.6 trillion\n\nSenator Warren is now playing catch-up: she\u2019s giving $2,400 as a permanent annual benefit increase to all social security recipients: that\u2019s a $150 billion give away, every year!\n\n\"Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth plan is tame by comparison.\" Stuart Varney, FOX Business\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet's get back to Bernie for a second: there\u2019s something truly ominous in his plan. He wants a national wealth registry! In other words, you have to tell the government what you\u2019ve got and where it is. That, of course, makes it much easier to take more of it in the future. It makes it more difficult to maintain your financial privacy. Oh, and by the way, there\u2019s a big exit tax if you want to leave the country with your money!\n\nThis is a whole new area of taxation, on top of income taxes, capital gains taxes, profits taxes, sales taxes, etc. etc.\n\nIf implemented, it would seriously hurt the economy, damage capital investment and damage innovation.\n\n\"If implemented, it would seriously hurt the economy, damage capital investment and damage innovation.\" Stuart Varney, FOX Business\n\nBut the socialists don\u2019t care. They\u2019re always angry and never happy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nBut that is the modern Democrat Party: still not over its defeat at the hands of a billionaire businessman.", "description": "FOX Business' Stuart Varney expresses his concern about two 2020 Democratic contenders.", "authors": ["Stuart Varney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/07/0/0/Debate-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
