I think it's about carefully looking at the details and tailoring, so you can spend your money wisely - a trench is a great transitional piece,' she said.\n\nCanna pointed out that the coat could also be worn as a dress, giving even better value for money.\n\n3.

OVER-SIZED CASHMERE CARDIGAN\n\nIn terms of outerwear, Jamie said she loves cosy cardigans in easy-to-wear shades like grey or charcoal.\n\n'This is sort of an all year round piece for me.

DESIGNER FLATS\n\nWhen it comes to Canna's capsule collection, she prefers to invest in excellent quality, 'pre-loved' clothes.\n\n'I buy a lot of high-end stuff from Facebook [market], and it means I've got money left over for saving or investing,' she explained.\n\nHer signature shoes are Chanel ballet flats, which she buys second hand, and Valentino Rockstud pumps, which she buys new.\n\n'They really glam up an outfit. I think they look fantastic when you wear all black - they're like jewellery for your feet!\n\n'They're a great statement piece.'\n\nCanna loves to hunt for 'pre-loved' designer pieces, and often buys her signature Chanel ballet pumps second hand. Her other favourite day-to-day shoe are Valentino Rockstud flats (pictured) which she describes as jewellery for the feet\n\n7. NEUTRAL MINI-SKIRT\n\nFor her chosen skirt, Canna selected a straight-cut beige mini-skirt gifted to her by a friend.\n\n'This is a really comfortable, beige linen skirt that goes with anything - white, black, navy blue, grey and pastel, whatever you like,' Canna said.\n\n'It literally works with everything, so versatile!\n\n'It sits really nicely on the hips and it's so flattering.'\n\nCanna's go-to skirt was a straight cut beige mini which she said works with every colour from white to pastel blue\n\n8. WHITE EMBROIDERED BLOUSE\n\nNext, Canna discussed her favourite short-sleeved white blouse from Vanessa Bruno.\n\n'This is a basic, cotton lace top which works with so many items in my wardrobe. I love where it stops on the arm - it's slimming, pretty and feminine,' she said.\n\nWhile significantly more expensive than other items in her capsule collection, Canna said she wears the blouse so often, she feels she has gotten value for her money.\n\n9. FAUX LEATHER JACKET\n\nIn terms of outerwear, Canna opted for a cool faux leather jacket from chain retailer Zara.\n\n'This is so comfortable, so timeless. I bought it about eight years ago and I still get so many comments on it!' she said.\n\nCanna wears the faux leather jacket with everything from jeans and black tracksuit pants to cocktail dresses.\n\nFor outerwear, Canna never passes up her faux leather jacket from Zara (pictured) which she bought eight years ago and is still complimented on\n\n10. DENIM JEANS\n\nCanna's favourite and arguably most versatile capsule piece were her low-rise blue denim jeans from upscale label Frame, which she called her 'all-time favourite' trousers.\n\n'I live in these. I've had them in black, white, light blue and this darker blue colour, and I find this shade is the most versatile,' she said.\n\n'I can wear black with it and it looks chic, or put a white shirt with it for a fun, fresher look.\n\n'They grab me in all the right places and help mask the parts of my body that I'm not so keen on! My all-time favourite jeans.'", "description": "Sydney-based financial expert and social media star Canna Campbell revealed the classic staples every woman should have in a capsule wardrobe, right in time for spring!", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/06/19381814-0-image-a-17_1570427128459.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
