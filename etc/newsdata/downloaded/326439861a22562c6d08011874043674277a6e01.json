Therefore it would continue with stage 1 loadshedding from 9am until midday, and thereafter implement stage 2 loadshedding which will continue until 11pm on Friday night.\n\nOn Thursday, Eskom acting chief executive Jabu Mabuza said that contingency plans were in place while they worked on fixing the conveyor belt.\n\n\u201cWe have activated our emergency command service centre and system recovery is in progress. Contingency measures were put in place to manually feed coal to Medupi and we have made a considerable amount of progress to have this done by the middle of next week.\n\n\u201cOur objective is not to implement load shedding. If we have to as a matter of last resort in order to protect the integrity of the system, we aim to do so at minimal levels, in the shortest duration possible,\u201d he said.", "description": "Eskom has done an about-turn, announcing on Friday morning that it would be returning to \u201cstage two\u201d loadshedding, as opposed to Thursday\u2019s assurance when the power utility said that stage one rotational loadshedding would take effect.", "authors": ["Staff Reporter"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7859/83f9e6abcf77437896f1b5dc010a2c5c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
