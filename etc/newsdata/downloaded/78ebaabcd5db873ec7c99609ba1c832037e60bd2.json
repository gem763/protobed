I took it personally, that I wasn't enough for him to live for.\n\n\"He said he just wanted to die.\"\n\nThen one day Haugen told Robby she knew a way that he could fall unconscious and not wake up.\n\nShe said: \"His eyes sparkled and he asked if I would do that for him and I said 'I love you, I would do anything for you'.\"\n\nHaugen claimed she was unable to go through with it - but the next day he told her he still wanted to die.\n\nShe said: \"The next day he said 'I couldn't expect you to do that for me' and I just felt I'd let him down all over again.\"\n\nThe killer says Robby then told he still wanted to die.\n\nShe added: \"I put my arms round him and he bowed his head. I put my other arm round him and squeezed until he was unconscious.\n\n\"I went to drive out of the parking lot but I realised I didn't know where I was. I looked at Robby and started to think about how I could get him back.\n\n\"I pulled out into the traffic and into another parking lot and started CPR. Then there was a knock at the window and it was a police officer.\"\n\nHowever, chilling police interviews conducted just after Haugen was arrested show her admitting she wanted to \"know what it felt like to kill someone with my bare hands\".\n\nShe told police: \"My last fiance broke my hand, then he got behind me, just like I did to Robby and choked me.\n\n\"I woke up on the floor and it was like I was under water and I just wanted to do that back - but he wanted it to happen.\"\n\nPolice also discovered Robby had been talking about his ex-girlfriend, Kate, to Hauger before his murder, something she admits she was jealous about.\n\nRobby had left home when he was just 18 and for six years his mum, Dori, and his step-father, Gene heard little from him.\n\nDori said: \"He was fun and he was outgoing and I loved him very much.\"\n\nGene added: \"He knew his lifestyle would be painful to us and there was so much we didn't know about his life.\"\n\nThe couple last saw their son in December 2014 and the final contact they had with him was when they were told he had gone into rehab the following year.\n\nHe seemed to have recovered well, but just four months later he was dead.\n\nIncredibly, Robby's family, who are committed Christians, have forgiven Haugen and are in regular contact with their son's killer.\n\nAs well as visiting her, they also call her and have a close bond with the woman who murdered their son.\n\nDori said: \"I was able to forgive Lindsay because I know I'm forgiven by God.\n\n\"To hang onto things can bring so much restentment inside of us, it can destroy us.\n\n\"She has brought me such joy. She took my son's life but her saying sorry and we see in our forgiveness that she is an example of how I need to be with my saviour, who has forgiven me.\"\n\nHauger is not eligible for parole until 2030 and one of the things taken into consideration are the views of the victim's family.\n\nShe said: \"It could be seen as beneficial to my parole. I hope to get out some day but I believe God has me here for a reason.\n\n\"If He wants me to stay in her for the whole 60 years, I will stay here.\n\n\"The only way I can show how sorry I am is to live the best life I can. If I can do something good with my life then his life will mean something.\n\n\"That might not be enough but that's all I can giveand that's what I do every day.\"\n\nI Am A Killer is available on catch up on Crime+Investigation and next week's episode will be screened at 9pm next Tuesday.", "description": "Lindsay Haugen strangled Robert Mast after knowing him for just 26 days after she claimed he begged her to and their story is featured on I Am A Killer", "authors": ["Jane Lavender"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20705327.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2-Lindsay-Haugen-altered.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
