But others suggest it\u2019s fine for cash-strapped individuals to place greater emphasis on home buying temporarily, as long as they redirect savings to retirement after meeting their house-savings goal.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that millennials, who are now aged 23 to 38, feel that \u201ctime is on their side\u201d when it comes to drawing from retirement savings, Kearns said, and are more likely than their older counterparts to feel they can make up the difference over time. And the older a person gets, the less likely he or she is to have parents in a position to help out financially, she said.\n\nSee also: Renters, this is how many years it takes to save up for a down payment on a home\n\nMillennials\u2019 sometimes-questionable funding streams underscore the rising cost of living, Kearns added. She highlighted a National Association of Realtors calculation that found home prices had far outstripped wage increases between 2012 and 2018 (47% compared to 16%).\n\nMeanwhile, non-home owning millennials who want to own a home are most likely to say their income isn\u2019t high enough (52%), the cost of living is too high (45%) and they have student-loan debt (23%).\n\nHere are tips from Kearns on how to responsibly save for your home down payment:\n\n\u2022 Do everything in your power not to sacrifice your retirement savings. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing you should ever touch, in my opinion,\u201d Kearns said. \u201cYou want to have a secure retirement.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Figure out how much house you can afford. Use a home-affordability calculator to get a ballpark estimate, and then be even more conservative, she said.\n\n\u201cMake sure you\u2019re focusing on what the monthly payment looks like for that mortgage, versus the overall loan amount,\u201d Kearns said. \u201cYou may qualify for a $300,000 mortgage, but your personal budget may not handle the monthly payment that comes with that once you take into account all these personal expenses that don\u2019t get included on a credit report.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Keep an eye on your credit report and score, as well as your debt-to-income ratio, to see what kinds of loan programs for which you might be eligible. Looking at this earlier gives you some breathing room to get your credit score in shape, Kearns said.\n\n\u2022 Create a separate savings account for your house fund, independent of your emergency fund or checking account, Kearns said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just saving as much as you can, as early as you can,\u201d she said. \u201cBuild out a long term plan and save early and often.\u201d Millennials in the survey tended to need three years to save up for the down payment and closing costs, she said, a bit longer than Gen Xers (2.75 years) and boomers (2.5 years).", "description": "Home buyers in their 20s and 30s are \u2018having to be very creative\u2019 to come up with down payment money.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR141_balanc_ZG_20190911164216.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
