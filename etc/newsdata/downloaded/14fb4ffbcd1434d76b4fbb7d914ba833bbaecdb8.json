Did what he had to do with minimum of fuss. 6\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka\n\nPlenty of energy and strong running from the wing-back position although his final ball often left a lot to be desired. Tussled well against Man\u00e9 on occasion. 6\n\nVictor Lindelof\n\nOutmuscled early on a couple of occasions by Origi but got his own back with the challenge that led to the opening goal. Escaped some poor defending when Man\u00e9\u2019s \u201cequaliser\u201d was ruled out. 5", "description": "Manchester United", "authors": ["Ian Whittell", "Keith Hackett", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213616190-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJfLQJpJYCFiad8lCpNrRI_DtoH7K6fhJGgaaDQnP8DQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
