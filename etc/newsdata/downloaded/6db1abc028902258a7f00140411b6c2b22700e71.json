Apple) New IPhones in Focus\n\nApple (NASDAQ: ) will take center stage tomorrow at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT) when the tech giant is set to reveal its trio of iPhone 11s and other gadgets like a new version of the Apple Watch.\n\n\u201cExpected price points look to be $749 for the base iPhone, $999 for the iPhone 11 Pro, and $1,099 for the iPhone Pro Max,\u201d Wedbush said. Any update on the upcoming launch of Apple TV+ - expected to go live in the early November \u2013 will also come into focus, Wedbush added.\n\nIn the run-up to the event, however, some on Wall Street have opted for caution, with Piper Jaffray saying it expected \"limited excitement\" around this year's iPhones.\n\nApple shares (NASDAQ: ) were up 0.31% on Monday. They're up 2.6% so far in September and 8.2% so far in the third quarter -- third best among the 30 stocks, after Home Depot (NYSE: ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ).\n\nMost on Wall Street are looking ahead to the launch of Apple's 5G phones next year, despite uncertainty about the upgrade cycle, Nomura said.\n\n\"We believe many investors are looking ahead to the 2020 5G iPhone launches,\" Nomura said. \"IPhone estimates may be optimistic and that the shape of the 5G cycle remains uncertain.\"\n\n2. Labor Market Check\n\nJust days after the data showed the U.S. economy created fewer jobs in August than expected, investor attention will turn to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey (JOLTs), which comes out at 10 AM ET.\n\nEconomists predict that the January fell slightly to 7.31 million last month from 7.48 million.\n\n3. API Crude inventories\n\nA from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday, is expected to be closely watched to gauge whether the supplies will continue to slide, and support prices the rally in oil prices seen so far this month.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute last Tuesday reported stockpiles rose by 0.40 million barrels, though U.S. government data, released a day later, showed a third-straight weekly draw.\n\ngained 2.4% to settle at $57.85 even as traders and investors concluded that newly appointed Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman would signal more aggressive efforts to curb oil output to support prices.\n\nNot everyone agreed, however. Wjile Abdulaziz bin Salman called on OPEC to continue output cuts, he said it would be wrong to preempt the meeting of OPEC and its allies. His comments \"are more or less market neutral,\" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.", "description": "Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7021H_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
