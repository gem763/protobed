But it doesn\u2019t count as a world record.\n\nThis story was updated on October 13 at 2:15 pm\n\nEarly yesterday morning, in a misty park in Vienna, Eliud Kipchoge ran a marathon in less than two hours. His time, 1:59:40, is the fastest any runner has ever covered 26.2 miles. Kipchoge carved two minutes off his own world record and became the first marathoner to break the two-hour barrier.\n\nAt the event, branded the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, the performance was heralded as a radical historic leap, his \u201cNeil Armstrong moment,\u201d as one announcer said. Indeed, Kipchoge himself\u2014a soft-spoken 34-year-old Kenyan who dulls the pain of distance running by smiling mid-competition\u2014has repeatedly equated his feat to reaching the moon.
