It makes sense: black is perennially trendy and horror allows for dramatic sartorial choices like capes and moody leather coats. They looks can also lean ironically into the feminine, like the baby doll dresses of haunted figurines or the virginal frilliness of final girls. It can work especially well for those who love to dress up for Halloween, but don't want to sweat through an ugly mask: the fashion-forward sensibilities of scary movies make for great costumes, and below are some under-the-radar choices to pick from (sure-to-be stand-outs among this year\u2019s legion of Jokers).\n\nThe Hunger (1983)\n\nHas there been a sexier movie than Tony Scott\u2019s The Hunger? Firstly, that steamy shower scene between Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie. And then all that sapphic bloodlust between Deneuve and her potential vampiric proteg\u00e9e Susan Sarandon? Whew. Everyone in this movie is unfairly hot, but it\u2019s Deneuve who steals the show, in large part thanks to her wardrobe, provided by Yves Saint Laurent. Deneuve was YSL\u2019s muse for many years (on-screen, he most famously dressed her in Belle de Jour) and here he lends a big-shouldered, glam-goth touch that transforms Deneuve\u2019s Miriam into an underground seductress. Most unforgettable is the opening, which takes place at a Bauhaus show, while Deneuve looks like a murderous stewardess.\n\nLady Vengeance (2005)\n\nA confession: This was my Halloween costume one year, and upon telling director Park Chan-wook, he asked me to email him a photo. It\u2019s been three years, and he still hasn\u2019t responded, and I\u2019m clearly still not over it. Such hang-ups aside, the signature look of the titular vengeful heroine rests on her lids: her red eyeshadow. You see, she\u2019s got her sights set on blood, after being released from prison for a murder she did not commit and being separated from her daughter for 13 years. Geum-ja (a.k.a. Lady Vengeance) dons cool leather trenches and floral dresses but the eye makeup sells the entire ensemble as capital-F Fashion. John Wick could never.\n\nMs. 45 (1981)\n\nAt the 2018 Met Gala, everyone wore their couture Sunday best for the theme of Catholicism (\u201cHeavenly Bodies\u201d). Had I had the golden ticket to attend, my reference would\u2019ve surely been Abel Ferrara\u2019s habit-donning protagonist in his seedy NYC thriller, played by It Girl Zo\u00eb Tamerlis. After two horrendous assaults in one day, the mute garment district worker transforms herself with daredevil red lipstick and a .45 caliber pistol (hence the title) to hunt down the male sex. Her timid outfits give way to sexy, grown-ass-woman pieces like high-collared blazers and hooded capes. But the nun outfit she wears to a Halloween party in the film\u2019s final act remains most iconic. (Plus, going as Ms. 45 nun is way cooler than just your typical \u201csexy nun.\u201d)\n\nDaughters of Darkness (1971)\n\nDelphine Seyrig may rival The Hunger\u2019s Catherine Deneuve as a seductive, French lesbian vampire. Seyrig plays Countess of Bathory in this cult film, and during a stay at a seaside Belgian hotel, sets off a game of cat-and-mouse with a newlywed couple she becomes obsessed with. The French title of the film translates to \u201cRed Lips,\u201d and Seyrig does indeed wear the shade to bloody perfection (in one scene, she stuns in a matching red dress and scarf and nails). The Countess is never not serving a look\u2014even when simply lounging around in a robe (a feathery one, of course)\u2014but when she turns up, she dials it to 11 (see above sequined dress).\n\nGanja & Hess (1973)\n\nIt\u2019s probably no surprise that the vampiric genre dominates this list\u2014they are, historically, the sexiest monsters. Plus, it\u2019s only helped that the sizzling duo of Marlene Clark and Duane Jones ( Night of the Living Dead) play the immortal lovers. Bill Gunn\u2019s vampire story is non-traditional; unlike the fellow 70s Blaxploitation flick Blacula, Gunn\u2019s vision is an experimental study of black lives and addiction. It is certainly not without its erotic moments: this is, after all, a beautiful picture with beautiful people. And a fashionable one, too, even though there are many scenes in which clothes don\u2019t come into play at all. Especially charming is Marlene Clark\u2019s wardobe as Ganja, dressed like she\u2019s going to a country club\u2014though this is far from that kind of vibe.\n\nPhenomena (1985)\n\nOf Dario Argento\u2019s movies, Suspiria is the one that gets talked about the most. It\u2019s so stylishly shot that it\u2019s become canon even in fashion, while its recent remake became the inspiration for Undercover\u2019s fall/winter 2019 line. Dare I say, the superior Argento fashion film is not Suspiria, but Phenomena, about a young girl at a boarding school (played by Jennifer Connelly) who uses her psychic powers to stop a serial killer? And that\u2019s because the costumes here are deceptively effortless. Young Connelly wears crisp white button downs and sweater vests\u2014looking enviably chic in school-girl uniforms\u2014while her oversized coat leans trendy even though it was probably bought big so she could grow into it.\n\nThe Love Witch (2016)\n\nAnd of course, we shan\u2019t forget Anna Biller\u2019s meticulously designed and directed The Love Witch, the go-to for modern example of fashion in horror. Her feminist black comedy is not a scary movie, per se, but it is an ideal mood board for occult fashion. Think: Lana Del Rey\u2019s autumnal transformation. With her teal eyeshadow and spidery lashes, Elaine (Samantha Robinson) is a beauty to behold, and every single outfit is to die for. It\u2019s hard not to root for a chic misandrist icon, turns out. From her coveted witchy wardrobe, her tearoom outfit is probably most recognizable: a peachy, lacy dream that\u2019s too sweet to be true.", "description": "Whether you're looking for costume inspiration or just some scarily good movies to binge, here are some under-the-radar choices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da72a9e9155fb000a6e8045/lede/1571242220849-The_Hunger2_high_res.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8373xh;0xw,0.0476xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
