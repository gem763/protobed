Notice no tag in the tweet so no way for Katie Pavlich to defend herself.\n\nLife sure comes at you fast when you're a Fox News contributor pic.twitter.com/vUYV9aeNtU \u2014 jordan (@JordanUhl) October 4, 2019\n\nLife sure comes at you fast when you\u2019re a troll who works for Media Matters.\n\nSome good \u2018Twitter Samaritan\u2019 must have informed Katie of Jordan\u2019s wussy-like tweets because she was more than happy to contact him DIRECTLY. Which is what you do when you\u2019re not a sad troll pretending that you in some way are fighting evil conservative media.\n\nBy screen-shotting and subtweeting.\n\nSuch fighters!\n\nWould you like to discuss the difference between Fast and Furious whistleblowers, who saw *first hand* the Obama DOJ trafficking thousands of guns to Mexican cartels to use in murders, and this? How Obama and Holder destroyed their lives? Context matters. https://t.co/qDNwZK9Zl4 \u2014 Katie Pavlich (@KatiePavlich) October 4, 2019\n\nWe\u2019re going to guess Jordan is not interested in discussing the differences with Katie, nope. Otherwise he would have tagged her in the first place.\n\nObviously a phone call is much worse than selling guns that were used to kill a American\u2026. Unknown how many Ives were taken by those guns. But phone calls are the problem\u2026 \u2014 daniel j. williams (@fins71) October 4, 2019\n\nDuh.\n\nOrange man bad and stuff.\n\nis this guy serious? Obama admin locked up the most whistleblowers in history. Do a little research. \u2014 BlackRockCity (@BlackRockCty) October 4, 2019\n\nMedia Matters \u2026 we\u2019re pretty sure that means he\u2019s not serious about much.\n\nFunny, the whistleblower requirement of \u201cfirst hand\u201d knowledge was just changed in August to be second hand information. So yes, whistleblowers with first hand knowledge are brave, leakers and rumors are not. Good job @KatiePavlich \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc \u2014 Miranda Dawson (@KratosLiving) October 4, 2019\n\nFunny how that works out, eh?\n\nRelated:\n\nWOW: You KNOW it\u2019s bad for Adam Schiff and his whistleblower claims when even WaPo is giving him 4 Pinocchios\n\n\u2018As long as it votes BLUE\u2019: Candace Owens calls AOC out for the real problem with her #EatTheBabies response (or lack thereof)\n\nHUGE if true \u2013> YUP, the whistleblower is a registered Democrat but it gets worse, SO much worse", "description": "You'd think they'd know better than to mess with Katie.", "authors": ["Sam Janney", "Posted At Pm On October", "Sam J."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/katie-pavlich_new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
