If you do not send a representative to testify at the hearing, you leave the Committee little choice but to make these policy decisions without your input.\u201d\n\nThe hearing in question, called \"Examining the Future of Transportation Network Companies: Challenges and Opportunities,\" is scheduled for this Wednesday.\n\nDeFazio wrote in the letters that his committee has had \"numerous conversations\" with the two ride-sharing companies but has been unable to secure a representative to testify from either.\n\nLyft did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the letters. Uber confirmed to The Hill that it had received the letter but did not provide comment on its contents.\n\nDeFazio's letter highlighted recents reports of \"sexual predation by drivers, the need for background checks and deactivation of dangerous drivers, and inadequate wages.\"\n\nLyft last month unveiled new safety features following a string of allegations from riders who say they have been assaulted by drivers. The new features came shortly after 14 women sued the company for mishandling a \u201csexual predator crisis\u201d among its drivers.\n\nUber has promised to release a transparency report with data on sexual assaults this year. An investigation last year found that more than 100 Uber drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse over the past four years.\n\nConcerns about substandard wages for ride-share drivers have been at the center of a push to give \"gig economy\" workers full benefits and pay.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to require Uber and Lyft, among other companies, to do so.\n\nThe two companies are planning to funnel millions of dollars into a ballot measure intended to overturn the law.", "description": "House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) on Monday sent letters to ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft warning them\u00a0not to\u00a0miss an upcoming hearing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cars.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
