For many, it will be a rosy-cheeked 17-year-old in a blue-and-white gingham pinafore en route to the Emerald City. No surprise, then, that when the fabric of picnic hampers began its fashion renaissance circa spring 2016, appearing on catwalks, Instagram and the woman next to you on the bus as frequently as Dorothy longed for home, Garland\u2019s character was often cited as style inspiration. The checked print is a byword for the wholesomeness associated with this young girl from Kansas \u2013 and fashion wanted a slice of it.\n\nWatching the new biopic Judy, in which Garland is played by Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, it\u2019s clear her style didn\u2019t start and end with that pinafore. Before Garland\u2019s death, after an accidental overdose at the age of 47, she starred in more than 20 films and, according to the film\u2019s costume designer, Jany Temime, Garland\u2019s style is as enduring a part of her legacy as her voice, warmth, and one-liners.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zellweger as Judy Garland and Finn Wittrock as Mickey Deans in Judy.

She was a comic; a witty woman.\u201d She thinks of the outfit she dressed Zellweger in for the scene of Garland\u2019s wedding to Mickey Deans, her final, short-lived marriage. The short blue dress, with frills at the neck and a matching blue pillbox hat was a look that Temime interpreted for the film, \u201cbut the original is as stupid and silly as that. She styled it herself with that little hat. That\u2019s so Judy Garland. She was trying to have fun with life.\u201d And fashion fun rang out via her love of feathers and sequins.\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger: \u2018A little mystery never hurt a girl\u2019 Read more\n\nThe film focuses the spotlight on her later life, specifically the year before her death in 1969. Tweaked out after decades of drug addiction and alcoholism, broke and haunted by past trauma, she is forced to go to London for five weeks of performances at the Talk of the Town cabaret club in a bid to earn enough money to help her reunite with her two younger children.\n\nThe costumes were all inspired by things Garland wore, but nothing is an exact copy \u201cbecause we had very heavy copyright\u201d says Temime, \u201cbut also because I didn\u2019t want to copy. The film is about Judy Garland, but it\u2019s not a documentary about Judy Garland; it\u2019s a drama.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Garland in her dressing room.

A red, pleated frock Temime saw Garland wearing in an interview became a red dress worn during an ill-fated TV appearance, followed by an ill-fated performance at the club.\n\n\u201cIt was understanding her and thinking she would have worn red at that moment \u2013 I was having a sort of sixth sense telling me this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was much better to work in opposition on that film,\u201d says Temime of the clothes. For example, at the start of the film, when Garland finds herself essentially homeless, Temime dressed her in a bright orange jacquard suit and green silk blouse. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to find a hotel to spend the night, and she\u2019s dressed up for the stage. This is her life at that moment. She is a star without a roof, but she had to look like a star.\u201d\n\nIn a later scene, before a high-stakes opening night performance and shut away in her hotel bathroom, Garland makes for a crumbling figure, but her clothes would have you believe otherwise. Her dress, says Temime, is \u201ca very big contrast with her state of mind at that moment \u2026 She feels like a piece of shit, she feels terrible, she\u2019s drinking, she cannot sleep, she\u2019s full of drugs.\u201d But the outfit speaks of Hollywood glamour meeting the London stage. Later, when she is buoyed up by a successful first night in London, Temime dresses her in pastels: \u201cShe starts feeling better, so I thought I don\u2019t need, any more, the aggression of the colour.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zellweger as Garland, wearing orange jacquard suit trousers and a green silk blouse. Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy\n\nGarland\u2019s style has echoes in the modern day beyond picnic-hamper chic. Look to the statement sleeves that her character, Esther, wore in Meet Me in St Louis \u2013 now ubiquitous, from high-end brands such as Balmain to high-street shops such as Zara. Or the waistcoat and tailored jacket she wore in A Star Is Born, which wouldn\u2019t look out of place at the most recent Marc Jacobs, Gucci or Burberry shows.\n\nThen, of course, there\u2019s the prairie dress, which has made the last few seasons feel like O Pioneers! \u2013 or a journey down the Yellow Brick Road. Garland\u2019s off-duty \u201cmum wardrobe\u201d in the film, which Temime made distinct from her more glamorous variety looks, chimes with the kind of easy style Miuccia Prada likes to champion. There are abstract printed shirts and camel-coloured cigarette trousers. \u201cShe was a woman from the States, and in the States they were wearing slacks,\u201d Temime says.\n\nThe modern feeling of some of the costumes helps to hammer home the present-day echoes of Garland\u2019s story. It was during her adolescence, which played out on sets, that she first became addicted to the drugs that would cause her death \u2013 MGM, to which she signed at 13, would give her amphetamines to keep her awake for long working days, and barbiturates to sleep on command. The film flashes back to these years of weight-shaming and abuse. It is no secret that child stars are also often beset by difficulties well into adulthood. \u201cIt could have happened today,\u201d says Temime. \u201cWe have lots of examples.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zellweger as Garland, performing on stage. Photograph: Allstar/BBC films\n\nDespite using lots of vintage clothes, she didn\u2019t want it to feel like she was creating a historical figure, hoping instead to make her feel dynamic and alive. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to put Judy Garland in a pocket of 1968,\u201d she says. \u201cAt a certain point you forget that it was once upon a time, it could be now,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to make it feel like she is completely eternal. She could still be alive. She\u2019s not dead, she\u2019s still there and everything she was wearing we could wear now.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Judy is released in the UK on 2 October.\n\n", "description": "As Ren\u00e9e Zellweger gears up to play the Hollywood star in Judy, the film\u2019s costume designer explains why Garland\u2019s clothes are as memorable as her voice and one-liners", "authors": ["Ellie Violet Bramley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81f493da4b8a2287234a9e3ed38372e09d99d80/0_192_1407_844/master/1407.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fb275b7b1c62b31abed85e8fdfd7a35c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
