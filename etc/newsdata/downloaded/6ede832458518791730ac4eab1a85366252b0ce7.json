The rookie drove in four runs and scored three times.\n\n\"I did know my dad had one,\" Cavan Biggio said. \"I have a ticket to the game he got it in in my room my whole life. I didn't think I was going to get up there for the opportunity.\"\n\nHe got his first hit off Chandler Shepherd, the second against Shawn Armstrong, the third versus Richard Bleier and the last off Mychal Givens.\n\nCraig Biggio hit for the cycle at Colorado's Coors Field on April 8, 2002, as part of a career that earned him induction into the Hall of Fame. He led off with a single against Denny Neagle, then tripled and homered off Neagle before doubling versus. Mike James in the eighth.\n\nThe only other father-son duo in major league history to hit for the cycle was Gary Ward for Minnesota at Milwaukee on Sept. 19, 1980, and Daryle Ward for Pittsburgh at St. Louis on May 26, 2004.\n\nCavan Biggio became the first player to hit for the cycle for Toronto since Jeff Fry against Texas on Aug. 17, 2001, and the first opponent to accomplish the feat in the 27-year history of Camden Yards. Kelly Gruber hit for the cycle for Toronto on April 16, 1989 against Kansas City.\n\n\"That was a crazy scene,\" Toronto manager Charlie Montoyo said. \"The whole dugout was cheering for him. A triple is hard to get in this ballpark. He was really going all out rounding second. He's aggressive at the plate and he's really doing better.\"\n\nCavan Biggio hit for the 3rd cycle in Blue Jays history tonight.<br><br>His father, Craig, also hit for the cycle once in his career.<br><br>The Biggios join Gary and Daryle Ward as the only father/son duos in MLB history to each hit for the cycle.<br>h/t <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EliasSports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@EliasSports</a> \u2014@ESPNStatsInfo\n\nTrey Mancini and Jonathan Villar homered for last-place Baltimore, which lost for the third time in four games and dropped to 49-102.\n\nMancini finished with four RBIs. He hit his 34th homer in the first and snapped a tie with a run-scoring single off Justin Shafer in the seventh.\n\n\"I think everybody wants to finish the year strong,\" Mancini said. \"It sounds cliche but it's honestly what I think about when I go up to the plate is to do what I can to help the team win and try to have a good at-bat.\"\n\nThe Blue Jays tied the game again when Biggio doubled, stole third and scored on a sacrifice fly by Lourdes Gurriel Jr. in the eighth.\n\nJustin Smoak put Toronto ahead when homered off Givens (2-6) leading off the ninth, Smoak's 21st homer and first since Aug. 27.\n\nTriple in 9th completes cycle\n\nBiggio tacked on two more runs with a triple before an error by Villar at shortstop allowed the eighth run to score.\n\nDerek Law (1-2) pitched a scoreless eighth inning.\n\nRandal Grichuk hit his 10th homer in 26 games against Baltimore.\n\nVillar hit his 22nd home run off Ken Giles in the ninth.\n\nOrioles manager Brandon Hyde was not happy about several gaffes his team made on the bases and defensively.\n\n\"I feel like for the most part this year we've competed our tails off. Just fell short quite a few times,\" Hyde said. \"I just thought we made a lot of mistakes tonight. I thought we played like a really tired team. We need better effort.\"", "description": "Cavan Biggio homered in the third inning, singled in the sixth, doubled in the eighth and tripled in the ninth to boost the Toronto Blue Jays 8-5 over the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5287791.1568773499!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/blue-jays-orioles-baseball.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
