Sega Genesis launched in October 1988 in Japan and a year later in North America.\n\nThe company, which has focused on developing and licensing games in recent years, is also releasing some classic titles for the mini console, including \"Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition,\" \"Sonic the Hedgehog,\" \"World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck\" and \"Castlevania: Bloodlines,\" which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. Other titles are more obscure, dating back to releases from the late 80s.\n\nThe mini costs $79.99 and is about 55% the size of the original. It ships with 42 games pre-installed and two simple controllers. It can plug directly into a TV and the controllers plug in via USB.
