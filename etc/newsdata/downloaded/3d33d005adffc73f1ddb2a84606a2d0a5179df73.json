All preparations for the operation have been completed,\" the Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter early on Tuesday.\n\n\"It is essential to establish a safe zone/peace corridor to contribute to our region's peace and stability, and for Syrians to achieve a safe life,\" it said.\n\nTurkey does not appear \"as of now\" to have begun its expected incursion into northern Syria, a senior Trump administration official said on Monday.\n\nA Reuters witness said there was no sign of military activity on Tuesday near the Turkish border town of Akcakale, across from Syria's Tel Abyad. Howitzers were positioned behind earth embankments on the Turkish side of the border, pointed towards Syria.\n\nU.S. forces evacuated two observation posts at Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain on Monday, a U.S. official said.\n\nTrump's warning on Turkey's economy appeared aimed at placating critics who accused him of abandoning the Syrian Kurds by pulling out U.S. forces. The decision drew criticism from Democrats and a rebuke from some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\"As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"RED FLAG\"\n\nHis remarks met an angry response in Turkey, including from opposition party politicians such as Iyi Party leader Meral Aksener who said it was a day to put aside domestic politics.\n\n\"Threatening Turkey's economy is a diplomatic catastrophe,\" she told her party's lawmakers in a speech in parliament. \"Today there is only one party and that is our red (Turkish) flag.\"\n\n\"The best response to this insolence is to go into the east of the Euphrates and break the terror corridor,\" she added.\n\nThe Kurdish-led forces, who have been Washington's most capable partners in fighting Islamic State in Syria, have denounced the major shift in U.S. policy as \"stab in the back\".\n\nMustafa Bali, an official with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the continued Turkish military buildup on the border, together with information about further mobilisation of Turkey-backed Syrian rebels, indicated that \"an attack is imminent and we expect it soon\".\n\n\"Naturally our preparations are along the length of the border with Turkey and our forces are in a state of readiness,\" Bali told Reuters.\n\nThe United States expects Turkey to take responsibility for captive Islamic State fighters in northeastern Syria if Ankara's planned incursion seizes areas where the detained militants are held, a senior State Department official said.\n\nThe captives are held in SDF facilities south of a safe zone initially proposed by Turkey.\n\nTurkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said overnight it was Turkey's fundamental right to take necessary measures for its national security against terrorism threats from Syria.\n\n\"Turkey is determined to clear terrorists from the east of the Euphrates and protect its own security and survival while implementing a secure zone in order to achieve peace and stability,\" Aksoy said in a written statement.", "description": "Turkey said on Tuesday it had completed preparations for a military operation in northeast Syria after the United States began pulling back troops, opening the way for a Turkish attack on Kurdish-led forces long allied to Washington.
