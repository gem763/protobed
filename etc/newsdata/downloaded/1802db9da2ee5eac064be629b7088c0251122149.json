Now he\u2019s here to save the news biz.\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Columbia Journalism Review, the Vermont socialist unveiled his plan to restore \u201creal journalism,\u201d find \u201creal journalists\u201d and save the profession from what he calls an \u201cassault \u2026 by Wall Street, billionaire businessmen, Silicon Valley and Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nYes, our industry\u2019s got troubles: Journalism jobs have plummeted in recent years; newspapers keep closing all across the country; and even the TV and cable folks are starting to see their revenues drop as the internet changes everything.\n\nBut billionaires aren\u2019t the problem: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos is keeping the Washington Post alive as a major paper; biotech gazillionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong is doing the same for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAnd, yes, President Trump makes all manner of angry noises about the media \u2014 but he\u2019s plainly a boon to liberal outlets, giving them fresh reason to stoke their readers\u2019 and viewers\u2019 outrage every day.\n\nAs for Bernie\u2019s \u201crescue,\u201d well: The crisis he sees is that \u2026 nobody\u2019s covering his pet subjects as much as he\u2019d like.\n\nSeriously: \u201cAt precisely the moment when we need more reporters covering the health-care crisis, the climate emergency and economic inequality,\u201d he rails, \u201cwe have television pundits paid tens of millions of dollars to pontificate about frivolous political gossip,\u201d he writes.\n\nSure sounds like he wants to save journalism by ensuring that he decides what we report.\n\nTo get to \u201creal journalism,\u201d Sanders would limit corporate ownership and boost newsroom unions \u2014 neither of which would bring in more money to an industry that\u2019s hemorrhaging it.\n\nHe does talk about taxing Google and Facebook ads \u201cand using the revenue to fund nonprofit civic-minded media.\u201d Great: Who gets to decide which outlets are truly \u201ccivic-minded\u201d? Bernie\u2019s feds, of course.\n\nAnd that does nothing for the vast majority of media that aren\u2019t nonprofit. There, he says only that he\u2019d \u201cexplore new ways to empower media organizations to collectively bargain with\u201d Google and Facebook. Even if that could work, it sounds like creating new media cartels \u2014 which he otherwise rages against.\n\nThe fact is, Sanders knows nothing about this biz. You can tell by the way he quotes extensively from Joseph Pulitzer \u2014 who, for all his high talk of journalistic ideals, was a canny operator who bought the money-losing New York World and helped invent \u201cyellow journalism,\u201d meaning sensational stories about crime, disasters and scandal.\n\nGo save someone else, Senator.", "description": "You can always count on Bernie Sanders: Whatever the problem, he\u2019s ready to fix things with more top-down control.
