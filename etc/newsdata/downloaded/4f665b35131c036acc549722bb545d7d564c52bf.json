That was down from 62% the year before, 70% in 2014-15 and 75% in 2011-12.\n\n\u201cI think you have to evolve your thinking, your approach,\u201d Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. \u201cMy rookie year we played a game against Cleveland and the game was in the 70s and that was deemed a really good defensive hard-nosed game. The climate has changed and you have to change with it.\u201d\n\nThe hard-nosed defensive game Williams speaks of - at least in the sense of what used to be considered that sort of game - no longer exists.\n\nMinnesota scored 140 points in a non-overtime game against Golden State on Jan. 16 and lost, becoming the first team in 27 years to score that many in a regulation contest and not win. The lowest winning score in the league last year was 89, by Memphis on Nov. 7, 2018 against Denver.\n\nLast season, there were an NBA-record 845 instances of a team scoring 100 or more points in a loss. Teams that didn\u2019t score 100 points went 64-385.\n\n\u201cAll the rules in today\u2019s NBA favor offense,\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder to guard teams and individuals. But the bottom line is if you want to be a championship-caliber team you have to be able to defend and defend at a high level. The Toronto Raptors won the championship last year - I think they were fifth in defensive efficiency. You have to find a way. You have to get players to buy in and commit.\u201d\n\nThere were only 64 instances last season out of 1,230 regular-season games where the winning score was below 100.\n\nTeams won 14% of the time when being held to 99 or less - compared with how they would win 35% of the time seven years ago. Some teams last season simply couldn\u2019t win unless they scored 100: Philadelphia was 0-7 when held to 99 or less, Golden State and New Orleans were both 0-8, Boston and the Los Angeles Clippers were 0-9, the Los Angeles Lakers and Atlanta were 1-10, San Antonio, Brooklyn and Dallas were 1-12, Minnesota and Charlotte were 1-13, Phoenix was 1-22 and New York was 1-28.\n\nMemphis was perhaps the \u201cbest\u201d team at winning when scoring less than 100 - the Grizzlies were 9-28 in those games.\n\n\u201cThe pace of the game and the level of skill, everything has gone up,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at it with respect to how much you score. The inverse side of that is what you can do to limit the opponent. And that\u2019s a big part of it. The more you limit the opponent and get stops, the greater your chances will be offensively.\u201d\n\nThe scoring boom that went on last year - fueled by a seventh consecutive year of record-setting 3-point numbers, faster pace leading to more possessions and the NBA\u2019s crackdown to ensure proper freedom of movement on the offensive end - isn\u2019t likely to be a one-year thing. A year ago, 20 teams averaged at least 110 points per game. The year before that, only six averaged that much.\n\nConsider: Just seven years ago, teams averaged 96 points per game. Last year, it was a smidge over 111 - the highest number the NBA had seen in nearly 50 years.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cActually, it\u2019s the NBA I grew up with the \u201880s with all these high scores. This game is changing. You\u2019ve got to adapt to it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers David Brandt in Phoenix and Schuyler Dixon in Dallas contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Getting to 100 points in the NBA used to almost certainly guarantee victory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/nuggets_suns_basketball_40088_c0-159-3828-2392_s1200x700.jpg?ef00d604a622a46acb26ad53f5be6da4b50dd02c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
