There's babies, old people, dogs even.\n\n'My wife's been ill since Saturday morning. I took my dogs out for a walk on Saturday and when we got back my German shepherd took a big drink of water then was sick all over the floor.\n\nPictured: Work to clean the water pipes on the Ladyhouse estate in Rochdale started three weeks ago\n\n'The concern is that there are old people or babies that could get seriously ill.'\n\nBenito Butler, 23, also lives on the estate with his partner Amy who is five and a half months pregnant and their two-year-old son.\n\nHe said: 'My son's nursery they had to send three kids home today most animals in Rochdale are sick.

It's not like we've all had the same dodgy curry.\n\n'We got as leaflet through the door about a month ago saying the water could be discoloured while the work was going on, but it's been running clear.\n\n'But I'm going to be getting some bottled water on the way home from work - you just can't take the chance.'\n\nWater company United Utilities warned residents they might experience a 'change in colour of their tap water' with this leaflet\n\nA United Utilities spokesman said water quality officers had taken samples from across the area and found nothing of concern.\n\nIn a statement, the firm added: 'We have been in the area carrying out mains cleaning.\n\n'Mains cleaning is carried out to remove naturally occurring deposits which have built up over time.\n\n'While carrying out the work, occasionally it can cause discolouration which is short-lived.\n\n'We have no reason to believe the water supply is causing the illness reported.\n\n'We would advise anyone feeling unwell speak to their GP about any illness they may be experiencing.'", "description": "The Ladyhouse estate in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, had its water pipes cleaned three weeks ago by a company called United Utilities.
