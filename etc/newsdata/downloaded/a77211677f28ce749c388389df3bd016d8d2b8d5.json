And still, a dog in France lives better than us.\n\nThe Turkish offensive has started to affect living conditions for those detained in the camp, with drinking water distribution disrupted and some supplies running low, a French national, M, who has been in Al Hawl for the past six months told Euronews correspondent Anelise Borges.\n\n\"Things are starting to get difficult,\" she said. \"There is no water in Al-Hasakah (the closest town) where a water processing facility was bombed. When you\u2019re in a camp in the middle of the desert, a day without water is a catastrophe.\"\n\nM, who is in Al Hawl with her 8-month-old child, said she is angry: \"We are treated like animals. And still, a dog in France lives better than us.\"\n\nM is a detainee in the Al Hawl camp.\n\nThis anger is shared by other detainees who, according to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that control the camps, have grown increasingly violent, setting fire to tents and attacking administrative and security officers with sticks and stones.\n\nCamp officials have also said some detainees have attempted to escape.\n\nA video published on the SDF\u2019s Coordination and Military Ops Center twitter account purports to show footage of dozens of burqa-clad women running from guards \u2014 the organisation claims they are trying to flee Al Hawl.\n\nWe have children \u2014 they didn\u2019t commit any crimes.\n\nMeanwhile, in Al Roj, the smallest of the three camps where just under 2,000 women and children are held (including former British schoolgirl turned IS bride Shamima Begum), the situation is eerily calm despite the Turkish military incursion, according to the detainees.\n\n\"We have no information whatsoever, the guards lie to us saying that nothing is happening,\" said Romina, a Spanish-German dual national who has spent the last two years in the camps after leaving for Syria six years ago.\n\nShe added detainees are following reports about Turkey\u2019s military operation online and on social media and are scared for what might happen to them if the fighting gets any closer.\n\nThose in the camps do, however, remain hopeful things can change for the better, Romina said.\n\nRomina is a detainee in the Al Roj camp.\n\nDetainees said they have heard planes and drones flying overhead, adding everyone in the camps is on edge for different reasons.\n\nGuards fear the approach of Turkish troops, while detainees hope they arrive as soon as possible \u2014 they believe Turkey will repatriate them back to their countries of origin and \"give them a second chance\".\n\n\u201cI said many times I regret what I did, I made a mistake. I hope that with Turkey we can go back and face the courts and have a chance to speak. We want to go back to our families,\u201d Romina said.\n\nRead more about the detainees' stories in Euronews' exclusive documentary \"Europe\u2019s Children of ISIS\"\n\nI'm tired. In the end, even if I am repatriated I will go jail... what a glorious future is waiting for me.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Turkey\u2019s military incursion into Syria has shifted the pieces in the complex puzzle that is the 8-year conflict, but the mood is different in the camps.\n\nIn Al Roj, there\u2019s anticipation, excitement even, among detainees. Romina said they are getting ready for what they believe is the beginning of the end of their nightmare: \u201cWomen are preparing for the journey, they are packing their bags, they are packing snacks and drinks\u2026 and hoping to come home soon.\u201d\n\nIn Al Hawl, on the other hand, M is not as optimistic: \"Obviously they will not repatriate us now it is impossible! It had to be done before!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s clear that the French government does not want us. They should have killed us all in Baghouz, that way we would not be a burden for anyone,\" she said.\n\n\u201cI'm tired. In the end, even if I am repatriated I will go jail... what a glorious future is waiting for me.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nExclusive: 'France doesn't want us' \u2014 Europeans who joined ISIS face Iraqi justice\n\nEurope\u2019s problem with jihad: The foreign fighters who tore families apart\n\nExclusive: Euronews speaks to European children of IS being held in Syrian camps\n\nExclusive: Europe's children of the so-called Islamic State", "description": "There\u2019s no doubt that Turkey\u2019s military incursion into Syria has shifted the pieces in the complex puzzle that is the 8-year conflict.
