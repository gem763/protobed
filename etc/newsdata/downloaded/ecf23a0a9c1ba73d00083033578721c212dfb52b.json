A number of players are understood to have reported Cotterill to the police.\n\nThe players\u2019 union has more than 4,000 members and is cash-rich, with reserves of \u00a350million. The general fund accounts for 2017-18 show that chief executive Gordon Taylor\u2019s total remuneration was more than \u00a32m.\n\nCotterill borrowed from his fellow players between 2014 and 2018, a period in which he was playing regularly for Birmingham City in the Championship as well as for Wales, for whom he won 24 senior caps.\n\nThe former Wales international has been accused of cheating team-mates out of \u00a3400,000\n\nOne player who is owed tens of thousands of pounds is understood to have contacted the PFA as long ago as the summer of 2018 after failing to receive a repayment he was due on a loan agreement signed a few months earlier, but did not receive any help.\n\nThe player has told Sportsmail the PFA representative he spoke to implied it was nothing to do with them and that they did not want to get involved in a dispute between members.\n\nAnother player who is owed more than \u00a330,000 has told Sportsmail he contacted the PFA last month asking for financial help chasing a County Court judgement made against Cotterill.\n\nThe PFA, headed by chief executive Gordon Taylor, has more than 4,000 members\n\nHe did receive a reply from a PFA executive, who told him they would assess the situation and get back to him, but has heard nothing since.\n\nCotterill has admitted he has outstanding debts to several players. He has acknowledged he has made mistakes but says he is trying to make amends.\n\nHis explanation for failing to repay many of the loans is that they were taken out when he was suffering from depression and alcohol dependency.\n\nCotterill has begun the process of attempting to pay back some of the money.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The PFA have been accused of ignoring requests for help from lower league players allegedly cheated out of their life savings by former Wales international David Cotterill.", "authors": ["Matt Hughes For The Daily Mail", "Harry Slavin For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19596368-0-image-a-9_1571088685044.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
