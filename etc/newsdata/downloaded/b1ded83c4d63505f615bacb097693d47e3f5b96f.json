A video from the scene showed Helles placing both feet on the fence before immediately collapsing on the ground and being quickly carried away by other protesters. The army claimed that the teenager tried to infiltrate Israeli territory but the Palestinians denied it.\n\nBy firing the shot, the soldier, whose name was not made public, was \u201cdisobeying an order leading to a threat to life or health,\u201d the military said on Thursday. More specifically, the soldier pulled the trigger without a \u201crequired permission from his commanders\u201d and against \u201cthe instruction he had received prior.\u201d\n\nThe service member was sentenced to one month in prison after making a plea deal. He will serve his term through army-related labor. The soldier was also given a probation period, and was demoted to private. He was not convicted of manslaughter because the military prosecutors could not find sufficient proof that the gunshot caused Helles\u2019 death.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Longest trial in history\u2019: Palestinian aid worker charged with funding Hamas attends 129th hearing\n\nPalestinians have been staging large-scale protests against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the blockade of the Gaza Strip by the IDF since March last year. Some protesters remained peaceful, chanting slogans and waving Palestinian flags near the border fence. Others tried to damage the fence, burnt tires and threw fire bombs and other objects in the direction of the Israelis, to which the IDF responded with tear gas and sniper fire.\n\nAt least 189 protesters have been killed by Israeli forces and more than 6,000 Palestinians wounded, according to the UN and global human rights organizations. In February, UN investigators said that the military\u2019s actions may amount to war crimes. Israel rejected the allegations, insisting its soldiers only target operatives from the militant group Hamas and dangerous rioters\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
