Moscow confirmed they were on an official visit, but ended up in a wrong place.\n\nThe Americans were traveling from the northern town of Nenoksa to Severodvinsk on Monday, it has been reported. The diplomats are said to include a US naval attach\u00e9 and two other military attach\u00e9s.\n\nAs one could have already been bracing for a spy thriller, the US embassy confirmed the incident. Yet, it brushed off allegations that the staff were in breach of any rules. The American mission claimed the group was on an official visit, authorized by the Russian Ministry of Defense.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ex-US Marine Paul Whelan indicted on spying charges in Russia \u2013 lawyer\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry had no objections to that part of the story.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe fully confirm the comment of the US embassy,\u201d a statement read. But Moscow had a bone to pick with the claim that the visit \u2013 as it was \u2013 was greenlit by the MoD.\n\nAccording to the Russian side, US diplomats merely asked the MoD for permission to travel to the city of Arkhangelsk and not Severodvinsk. The communities are located some 45 kilometers from each other. That said, Moscow also tried to add some humor to the story.\n\n\n\nApparently, they got lost. We are ready to present the US embassy with a map of the Russian Federation.\n\nSeverodvinsk has a major shipyard for Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet, as well as hosting a base for nuclear-powered submarines. Meanwhile, Nenoksa is home to a secretive military testing ground which has recently generated more than a few international and local headlines.\n\nAlso on rt.com Norwegian ex-border guard sentenced to 14 yrs in Russia for nuclear sub espionage\n\nIn August, a prototype missile engine with an \u201cisotope power source\u201d exploded during trials, killing five people. The ill-fated tests prompted rumors of \u201cradiation leaks,\u201d while tabloids were quick to brand the incident a \u201cnew Chernobyl.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry denied the alleged leak and refuted reports of a large nuclear clean-up operation.\n\nEarlier this year, former Norwegian border guard Frode Berg received a 14-year jail term in Russia for harvesting secret data about the subs and \u201charming the defensive capabilities of the Russian Federation.\u201d The Norwegian national \u2013 who was acting on behalf of the country\u2019s intelligence \u2013 was first detained by Russian counter-intelligence operatives back in 2017.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
