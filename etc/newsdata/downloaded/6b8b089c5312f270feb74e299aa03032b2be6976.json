Photo: Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\nMark Ronson, the producer behind hits like \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d crushed the dreams of the millions of dumb people when he announced on Good Morning Britain that he is sapiosexual \u2014 meaning, sexually attracted to someone\u2019s intelligence, possibly over their gender. Twitter went wild, and Out magazine even covered his \u201ccoming out,\u201d but now, the producer is thinking twice. In a video interview with Rolling Stone Wednesday, he said it was all a misunderstanding, telling writer Patrick Doyle, \u201cI went to sit down and talk about my album and things that I actually know about.\u201d Which, for the record, probably would\u2019ve been a normal thing for a sapiosexual person to do. But the hosts had just done a segment about sapiosexuality, and when they explained it to him, he thought, \u201cThat sounds great, of course, who wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d Sometimes we\u2019re just inexplicably attracted to dumb people, Mark, don\u2019t shame us for it, okay?\n\nRonson, who divorced model Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume last year, stresses that he didn\u2019t mean to take on a marginalized identity. \u201cIt sounds like I went on a TV show to be like, guys, I got, I have some big news,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI would like to come out and say properly that I do not consider \u2014 where\u2019s the camera? \u2014 I do not consider myself part of any marginalized community, and I apologize if anybody misunderstood or took offense to it.\u201d So there you have it \u2014 if you happen to be a dumb person with a crush on Ronson, there\u2019s still hope.", "description": "Mark Ronson, the producer behind hits like \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d told Rolling Stone he didn\u2019t mean to take on a marginalized identity when he came out as sapiosexual by accident last week on Good Morning Britain.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-mark-ronson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
