Carne asada is made from a better cut of meat, which offset any gains made through moderating avocado prices, Hartung said on the call.\n\nCarne asada went through the company\u2019s \u201cstage-gate process,\u201d which vets items and initiatives before they\u2019re added to the menu or implemented. Chipotle\u2019s loyalty program went through the process, and queso blanco is going through it now.\n\nHartung, who spoke with MarketWatch after the call, said that Chipotle began looking for a carne asada source six-to-eight months ago. In keeping with the company\u2019s \u201cfood with integrity\u201d guideline, it took animal treatment and other factors into account.\n\n\u201cIt was so popular that, with more notice, now 12 months, we can secure even more supply,\u201d he said. \u201cThe grow-out for cattle is two-to-three years, so it\u2019s not something you can do overnight.\u201d\n\nThe abbreviated carne asada run doesn\u2019t sit well with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Jake Bartlett.\n\n\u201cThe Sept. 19 national carne asada launch successfully drove incremental traffic, check and profits as we expected,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe were surprised that a product that was tested for four-to-five months, required new in-store training and was supported by a high-profile ad campaign is being offered for ~2 months.\u201d\n\nRead: McDonald\u2019s expected to jump into the chicken sandwich war next year: KeyBanc\n\nDue to its success, SunTrust thinks Chipotle will want to make carne asada a permanent menu item. Chipotle wouldn\u2019t comment directly, but said in a statement that it is \u201ccontinuously looking for ways to meet demand.\u201d\n\nSunTrust also thinks queso blanco will be the next permanent addition to the menu.\n\nSunTrust rates Chipotle stock buy and cut the price target to $900 from $920.\n\nComparative store sales accelerated with carne asada was launched, and sales accelerated at the end of quarter, with sales levels heightened into October, Hartung said on the call. Comp sales in December will be tough as the company laps the launch of delivery bowls last year.\n\n\u201cWe wonder if Chipotle could run a promo or other offer to help comp the difficult December comp and maintain one-year momentum in 2020,\u201d wrote UBS.\n\nChipotle reported comp sales growth of 11%, a figure that Hartung told MarketWatch is \u201cunheard of for a company of our size.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith few signs of a near-term slowdown and expectations elevated, strong comps (around the high-single digits) are still needed as comparisons become more difficult beginning Q4 and into 2020, and we think solid flow-through must support 2020 earnings per share approaching $20.\n\nFactSet is forecasting comp sales growth of 8.8% for the fourth quarter and 2020 EPS of $17.75.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Beyond Meat initiated at sell as large competitors make gains in plant-based food\n\nUBS has a sell rating on Chipotle shares with a $690 price target, up from $650.\n\nEven with the abbreviated run, BTIG analysts led by Peter Saleh think Chipotle is tracking \u201cback to peak unit economics.\u201d Analysts think the focus on Chipotlanes, which allow customers to pre-order online and drive up to a designated window to pick up their meal, will provide a boost.\n\n\u201cChipotlanes in 2020 will help drive sales volumes, margins and digital mix all higher given the likely superior economics of these units,\u201d wrote BTIG, which reiterated its buy stock rating and $890 price target.\n\nHartung said on the call that Chipotle expects to have 60 Chipotlanes by the end of 2019. More than 80 restaurants are under construction and half of them will have Chipotlanes.\n\n\u201c[B]ased on the early success of Chipotlane, we shifted our real estate strategy to seek more sites that can accommodate Chipotlane,\u201d he said on the call.\n\n\u201cEvery time we make it more convenient to try Chipotle, customers respond,\u201d he told MarketWatch .Chipotle stock has rallied 93.5% over the past year while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18% is up 13.2% for the period.", "description": "Chipotle says it had a short time to source beef and supply is likely to run out in a matter of weeks.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR686_chipot_ZG_20190919163136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
