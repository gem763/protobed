She also happens to be running on populism, muscling in on Trump\u2019s pitch to the working class.\n\nCoincidentally, she\u2019s also the member of the Democratic field who\u2019s taken the hardest shots from Trump to date. Except they haven\u2019t seemed to hurt her much.\n\nGo figure that a president who places great stock in crowd energy, in draining the swamp, and in his own ability to tear down opponents is a little nervous about the rise of Elizabeth Warren.\n\nThe frustration Republicans are beginning to feel about Warren\u2019s non-stick nature was picked up repeatedly in interviews with 10 Republicans, including Trump campaign and White House officials, associates of the president, and other GOP operatives with knowledge of the situation. These sources stressed that the anti-Warren effort within GOP circles hadn\u2019t fallen off since the DNA snafu. Indeed, everyone from officials on Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign, to the Republican National Committee, to a select group of opposition researchers have been sifting through her record in search of vulnerabilities. But with few punches landing, the worry is that Trump may have already taken his best shot, and that Warren will end up looking increasingly formidable for having bounced back. \u201cSure the Republican base will ultimately loathe Warren, but she doesn\u2019t inspire the same kind of historic vitriol that Hillary Clinton did,\u201d a separate Republican strategist said. \u201cThat, combined with fact that SCOTUS isn\u2019t on the line as it was in \u201916, and remembering that Trump needed the perfect inside straight to barely win last time, and any Democrat is going to be tough to beat, Warren included.\u201d\u2026 According to three people who have spoken to Trump about Warren over the past two months, the president has specifically highlighted what he views as her surprising political and populist talents during the Democratic primary, and has told multiple advisers and associates that he hears she could be \u201ctougher\u201d in a general election than many initially expected. One of these sources said Trump asked the room if they thought Warren was a \u201cfighter.\u201d\n\nOne Republican told the Beast that right-wing think tanks may have been caught flat-footed by the sheer number of policy plans Warren has introduced, unable to analyze and critique them as quickly as she\u2019s rolling them out. That assumes, of course, that (a) anyone on either side cares what think tanks say and (b) a conservative critique of the cost of Warren\u2019s agenda would resonate with centrist Dems. Would it? How many Biden fans are with him because they worry about the budget and how many are with him simply because he\u2019s familiar and seems electable?\n\nThere isn\u2019t much Trump or the GOP can do to hurt Warren right now. If anything, Trump attacking her regularly again would gift-wrap a talking point for her that she\u2019s the candidate whom he really fears, which would be catnip to Democratic voters. If anyone\u2019s going to take Warren down, it\u2019ll be her rivals in the primary. That\u2019s coming soon, of necessity \u2014 if they don\u2019t start chipping away at her, she might just run away with this thing.\n\nAides to three rival candidates confirmed in interviews they\u2019re revving up opposition research on Warren in preparation for the next debate on Sept. 12. Still others privately complained she\u2019s gotten fawning treatment in the media as she unveiled a litany of ambitious plans without being pressed on where the money would come from to pay for them\u2026 \u201cShe\u2019s promised about $50 trillion worth of benefits in the last 30 days. Her economics are fraud and at some point someone is going to point that out. She\u2019s a multimillionaire professor at Harvard. She can\u2019t rail against the 1 percent \u2014 she is one of the 1 percent,\u201d [Biden organizer Dick] Harpootlian said\u2026 In an interview, [Harris advisor Bakari] Sellers complained that Harris has battled sexism, racism \u201cand the Russians\u201d while others in the race, including Warren, have had an easier ride, including on the debate stage.\n\nMm yeah, that\u2019s the good stuff. Sellers\u2019s point in particular may resonate: Although the latest poll of South Carolina had Warren inching into second place, she\u2019s a distant second due to how poorly she performs with black Democrats there. Among white SC Democrats Warren actually leads the field with 26 percent; among blacks, who are a majority of the primary electorate, she\u2019s in fourth behind Biden, Harris, and even Bernie Sanders. Winning Iowa and New Hampshire would do *a lot* to change that for her next year, but maybe not quite enough to completely erase Biden\u2019s advantage in the state. Doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t be the nominee but it does mean that the primaries could go on much longer than she\u2019s hoping and end up with black Democrats no more enthused to turn out for her in the general election than they were for Hillary.\n\nThe X-factor is Bernie. For all the hype about Warren\u2019s surge, and despite the narrative that she\u2019s pulling away voters from Sanders, his own numbers have barely budged this summer. He was at 17.0 percent on June 5, when her rise began. Three months later, she\u2019s gained nearly 10 full points in the average while he\u2019s lost less than one, landing at 16.1 percent. Warren isn\u2019t cannibalizing longstanding Bernie voters \u2014 but she is almost certainly depriving him of undecideds who are in the market for a progressive candidate. What\u2019s he going to do about it? Politico notes in the story above that he and Warren have had a nonaggression pact thus far, with neither wanting to antagonize the other\u2019s base by attacking their favorite. Warren voters are potential Bernie voters, after all, and vice versa. Some progressives think the nonaggression pact should be maintained no matter what, in the belief that nominating Sanders *or* Warren is what\u2019s most important for progressivism.\n\nBut how does Bernie feel about that? If he agrees that it\u2019s essential to have a progressive nominee, even if that comes at the cost of his own defeat, then the way forward is clear. He should drop out, endorse Warren, and campaign aggressively for her. There\u2019s a risk of backfire in that since some Sanders fans have Biden as their second choice but an aggressive effort by Bernie to steer them towards Warren would doubtless pay off with some. At the core of Sanders\u2019s ideological base, though, is the belief that he alone can rescue America from its capitalist excesses. He\u2019s the only candidate with the stones to label himself a socialist, the only one to refuse to call himself a Democrat (until recently). Warren and Sanders may be indistinguishable to right-wing eyes but they certainly aren\u2019t to left-wing ones, in which case how can Bernie pass on the opportunity to attack her? He owes it to the Cause to try to convince her voters that she simply won\u2019t deliver on her promises like he will \u2014 but if he does that, he risks an embittered progressive schism that\u2019ll benefit Biden long-term. What does he do?", "description": "\u201cWe all push out the bad Warren stories but they don\u2019t go very far.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ew.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
