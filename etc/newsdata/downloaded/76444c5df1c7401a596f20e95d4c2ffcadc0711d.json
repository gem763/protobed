That\u2019s about $10,000 short of the record set more than two years ago when soaring prices prompted a series of government policy changes to cool the market. Prices were driven higher by a decline in supply, with active listings down 14 per cent to 17,254.\n\nSales in the Toronto region jumped 22 per cent to 7,825 units from the same period last year, the Toronto Real Estate Board said Thursday. All housing segments saw double-digit gains, led by a 29 per cent sales jump for detached homes. Sales were well below the record set in September 2016 of more than 9,800, and on a seasonally-adjusted basis, sales fell 0.3 per cent from August.\n\nThe average price of a home in Toronto rose 5.8 per cent to $843,115, the highest price this year, though well below the peak of almost $921,000 set in April 2017.\n\nDemand for homes in Canada\u2019s biggest city continues to grow amid lower interest rates and a crunch in supply thanks to strong immigration flows. Buyers have also adjusted to stricter mortgage-lending rules put in place to cool the market. Sales in Vancouver rebounded 46 per cent last month after a policy-driven slump, though prices continue to dip.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Sales surge 22%", "authors": ["Natalie Wong", "Erik Hertzberg", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/house-sale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
