So many people signed up that it morphed into multiple music festivals.\n\nA festival seemed a little more practical than capturing aliens, but people didn\u2019t let the raid go. Yes, it would appear that not everyone is totally joking about the raid.\n\nIntrigued by the most enduringly popular meme of the year that was clearly a complete joke, enthusiasts were still determined to get as close as they could to Area 51, as evidenced by the Area 51 YouTube videos and livestreams.\n\nSo even if you couldn\u2019t get in on the revelry, you can check out all of the visitors documenting their comical \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nThere were plenty of people storming but not exactly really storming Area 51.\n\n\u201cThe guards were unbelievably nice. They took photos with everyone and were pretty much just smiling,\u201d Danny Philippou, an Australian YouTuber who joined the festivities told TIME.\n\nOne woman did enter, walking beyond the facility\u2019s gates, captured in this video shared to Twitter.\n\nSo like some old lady ACTUALLY stormed #area51 pic.twitter.com/SKvSdUUYul \u2014 Matthew Carswell (@Leche_frio) September 21, 2019\n\nAttendee Ellie Urquhart walks past a security line as people gather to More\n\nBut as the original event creator said it best: No one can stop all of them.\n\nNone of the warnings have deterred some people who appear to be curious from trying to get close to the secretive facility that has enthralled conspiracy theorists.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the highly secretive military base became the subject of highly amusing jokes back in July.\n\nAnd then, as promised, enthusiasts for all kinds of extraterrestrial lore and a rollicking good time descended on Rachel, Nevada for one of them. (Brothers of Alien Rock, the Weird Kids and Speed of Light are among the bands who told TIME they\u2019re going to perform at the festival in Rachel.)\n\nBRIDGET BENNETT&AFP/Getty Images More\n\nHow many people went to the Area 51 Raid event?\n\nPredictably there was no alien activity uncovered, but that doesn\u2019t mean anyone stopped believing. About 3,000 people turned up for the gathering for the fun of it. And most of them did not try to storm the gates, the Lincoln County Sherif\u2019s Office told CNN. Restraint! Somewhat surprisingly, two YouTubers did attempt to visit the site before the weekend, despite seeing the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, and were promptly arrested for trespassing.", "description": "People are actually posting Area 51 raid livestream videos on YouTube of the event and they're not really kidding.", "authors": ["Ashley Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5JiCRzx6rjwmM2I2EoEBpA--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/7ef2a9e52a64c3a76245408cb917e17e"}
