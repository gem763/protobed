He claimed the woman was simply a fan asking for an autograph and photo.\n\nIt emerged three months ago the hunk paid more than \u00a34million to a Cheshire property developer to build his mansion.\n\nOh dear: The sportsman is set to move into the six-bed mansion later this month, but residents in the village have raised concerns about the sprawling three-storey property\n\nSpeaking about his new home, one neighbour said: 'The development is very nearly complete but it's a sore thumb on the landscape.\n\n'It's been a surprise to the local village that Rooney was moving here in the first place and many didn't know what to think, especially as the land deal was kept quiet.'\n\nThe nearby resident added: 'The house which is taking shape wasn't what many people expected and is not in keeping with the local built environment.\n\n'Some of us are concerned when the Rooney's move into the property they may completely change the atmosphere of this tranquil village.'\n\nThe media personality is also currently locked in a battle over plans to build the agricultural outbuilding, which led to suggestions he was set to become a farmer when he hangs up his boots.\n\n'Looks like a Morrisons': Social media users claimed the new mansion looked a bit like a supermarket, with other users saying it looked like a Tesco or even a Travelodge\n\nWayne's planning agents said in the application: 'The proposed building is to provide shelter and security to machinery and equipment related to the upkeep of the agricultural land.\n\n'It will also provide dry storage for hay. The proposed building will be used for storage of farm maintenance such as a tractor and also as a hay store when required.'\n\nBut the shed plans - submitted in July last year - are facing opposition from the local parish council.\n\nOllerton and Marthall Parish Council spokesman said: 'The application is located within the Green Belt where development is subject to stricter control and the policy focus is on preserving the openness of space, setting and rural character.\n\n'Ollerton and Marthall is washed over by the Green Belt and careful consideration should be afforded to maintain the openness of space and avoid harm caused by inappropriate development.\n\n'Given the scale of this development which has become much more visible from the road, any further impact on the Green Belt must be carefully considered.'\n\nFollowing the comment, the application was withdrawn but resubmitted in February this year and is yet to be considered.", "description": "The WAG, 33, brushed aside her recent woes as she enjoyed some quality time with her son Kit, three, at\u00a0Gulliver's World Theme Park in\u00a0Warrington on Sunday.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo", "Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19403962-0-image-a-52_1570464271575.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
