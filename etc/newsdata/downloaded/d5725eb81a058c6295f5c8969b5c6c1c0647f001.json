Her latest company, Hacker House, was also given a \u00a3100,000 grant earlier this year by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nAsked if she ever discussed the awarding of that money with Johnson, Arcuri said: \u201cCategorically no\u201d. She added: \u201cDo you think I would waste his time talking about this stuff?\u201d\n\nAsked if she loved Johnson, she said: \u201cI care about him deeply as a friend and we do share a very close bond, but I wish him well. I want him to be happy. I wish Carrie [Symonds] well. And I really do want him to focus on making Britain great again.\u201d\n\nArcuri was repeatedly asked whether she had an intimate relationship with Johnson, but refused to answer. She said: \u201cBecause the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer, I am really not going to answer that question. I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer.\u201d\n\nShe said she and Johnson \u201calways had a laugh\u201d about the pole in her Shoreditch flat where a offices were located. She said: \u201cI said he could have a go. He sat down with his tea and started muttering.\u201d\n\nShe also confirmed the Guardian\u2019s revelation that she listed Johnson on her phone as \u201cAlex the Great\u201d.\n\nShe said she could not recall how many times Johnson visited her flat but suggested it was between five and 10 times.\n\n\u201cWe tried having drinks out in public or having lunch, it just became too much of a mob show, so I said: \u2018You just have to come to my office.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnson insisted last week that everything he did when promoting London overseas as mayor was done in \u201ccomplete conformity with the code and the rules\u201d. He also claimed there he had no interest to declare over Arcruri.\n\nFollowing allegations about favours and funds given to Arcuri, four separate inquiries have been launched:\n\n\u2022 The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is withholding more than half of a \u00a3100,000 grant to promote UK digital awarded this year to Arcuri\u2019s company, Hacker House, pending a review into how the money was allocated.\n\n\u2022 The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, launched an independent review into how Arcuri was given sponsorship and access to trade trips led by Johnson when he was mayor.\n\n\u2022 The London assembly\u2019s oversight committee has given Johnson until next week to explain his apparent conflicts of interest over Arcuri.\n\n\u2022 The Independent Office for Police Conduct has been asked to look at whether Johnson committed a criminal offence of misconduct in public office, because during his time as mayor he was also responsible for the Metropolitan police.", "description": "US businesswoman denies PM helped her career when he was mayor of London", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver", "John Crace"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87068e9e2a01de14b6ac44f5d67005b3989b61e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c0c80a9426f2d3f03d9611e15b4b444", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
