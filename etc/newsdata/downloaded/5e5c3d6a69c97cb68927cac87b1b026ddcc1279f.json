One recent tender document requested help to build \u201csystems that \u2026 can autonomously carry out tasks without human intervention\u201d.\n\nThe developments emerged during a Guardian investigation into one of the most radical but least understood welfare reforms since the roll-out of universal credit that will apply to 7 million people.\n\nThe DWP believes welfare transactions could be handled more quickly, accurately and cheaply using robotic process automation and is developing it for use in UC.\n\nBut claimants have warned the existing automation in UC\u2019s \u201cdigital by default\u201d system has already driven some to hunger, breakdown and even attempted suicide. One described the online process as a \u201cKafka-like carousel\u201d, another as \u201chostile\u201d and yet another as a \u201cform of torture\u201d. Several said civil servants already appeared to be ruled by computer algorithms, unable to contradict their verdicts.\n\nHow Britain's welfare state has been taken over by shadowy tech consultants | Philip Alston and Christiaan Van Veen Read more\n\n\u201cWe are striking the right balance between having a compassionate safety net on which we spend \u00a395bn, and creating a digital service that suits the way most people use technology,\u201d said a DWP spokesperson. \u201cAutomation means we are improving accuracy, speeding up our service and freeing up colleagues\u2019 time so they can support the people who need it most.\u201d\n\nBut Frank Field, chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee, warned that vulnerable claimants \u201cwill be left at the mercy of online systems that, even now, leave all too many people teetering on the brink of destitution\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen, in the gig economy, how workers are managed and sacked, not by people, but by algorithms,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the welfare state looks set to follow suit, with the \u2018social\u2019 human element being stripped away from \u2018social security\u2019.\u201d\n\nKey details about the automation push remain secret. The DWP has refused freedom of information requests to explain how it gathers data on citizens. Simon McKinnon, the chief digital and information officer of DWP Digital, said this year it was developing a way to \u201cbuild a holistic understanding of digital personas\u201d, but refused to say what information was gathered to do this.\n\nThe ministry has previously told parliament it gathers data from private credit reference agencies, the police, the Valuation Office Agency, the Land Registry and the National Fraud Initiative, which gather information from public and private bodies. But it is now declining to update the list, claiming it would \u201ccompromise the usefulness of that data\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are concerns that government is accelerating the automation of the welfare system without a proper evidence-based consultation about its impacts,\u201d said Dr Lina Dencik, co-founder of the Data Justice Lab at Cardiff University.\n\n\u201cUsers have already raised significant problems and we need to understand which groups are more likely to be targeted by algorithmic decision-making than others to understand if it shows bias.\u201d\n\nThe centre of the robotics drive is the DWP\u2019s \u201cintelligent automation garage\u201d, a unit based in Newcastle and Manchester where 32 programmers design, build and run automations.\n\nStaff are using UiPath to develop machine learning to check claims for fraud, which suggests welfare computers will autonomously learn and alter the way they make decisions with minimum human intervention.\n\nOne recent staff member at Newcastle told the Guardian they already \u201chave ways of creating a digital image of somebody\u201d. He stressed much of the work was secret, but said this did not mean it was against citizens\u2019 interests.\n\nThe digital transformation is costing hundreds of millions of pounds. The DWP Digital\u2019s budget has risen 17% to \u00a31.1bn in the past year and IT firms have been awarded huge contracts to help run the system. The DWP is also rapidly expanding its own private technology company Benefits and Pensions Digital Technology Services, which recruited more than 400 staff in the year to April, while DWP Digital recruited 520.\n\nA spokesperson for the DWP insisted it was using AI to help people find work, to reduce the burden on claimants to prove their circumstances, and to help vulnerable people access welfare more easily without having to provide evidence of their digital identity.\n\n\u201cWe want to be supporting staff and citizens with the information they need, at the right time, and not disadvantaging those who are vulnerable,\u201d they said.\n\nHowever, there is evidence of rising error rates in parts of the welfare system that have already been automated. A system of realtime data-sharing between the HMRC tax office and the DWP about universal credit claimants\u2019 earnings is triggering more and more disputes, with the rate rising fourfold between May 2017 and October 2018, according to the government\u2019s own figures, with up to 5,700 people a month affected.", "description": "DWP spending millions on \u2018intelligent automation garage\u2019 to develop welfare robots to replace humans", "authors": ["Robert Booth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b837cdd5d0b2857c89627e95996f72a5d85f88b8/0_130_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b8cdc5a9b5a3a2857915fedf24bdf0d", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
