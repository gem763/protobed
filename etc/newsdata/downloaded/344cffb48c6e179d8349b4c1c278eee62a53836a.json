The chief executive is turning away from promises made during the run-up to Domo\u2019s IPO, and still struggles to actually describe the company\u2019s business, even as he promises \u201cto simplify our message.\u201d\n\nDomo investors are paying the price: Worth $1 billion as recently as May, the company\u2019s market cap is headed lower than $500 million after its outlook for the third quarter and the rest of the year fueled a 35% drop in its stock in after-hours trading Thursday afternoon. The company appears to be going through a major pivot in its strategy due to a focus on big enterprise deals that did not pan out, and it admitted that customers and investors still do not completely understand what it does.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows, and you\u2019ve recounted back to us, that our offering in the space has been difficult to explain,\u201d Domo Chief Executive Josh James said. \u201cIt\u2019s also been the No. 1 complaint from our reps as the recent round of acquisitions has brought more attention and structure to our space and how people describe it and think about it. It\u2019s created an opportunity to simplify our message.\u201d\n\nBut when asked by an analyst to offer that simple message, James talked for several minutes without getting to a concise description. The quick message, he said, is that \u201ceveryone is looking for digital transformation,\u201d with some standard promises to visualize and analyze data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still refining it and we\u2019ll roll it out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know, kind of make sure that everyone is aware of it.\u201d\n\nRead more about Domo\u2019s IPO and why it should have been a no\n\nThat performance should truly scare investors. As an analyst pointed out, a big message from the company during its IPO roadshow was that it needed to move \u201cup market\u201d to larger enterprise customers. However, in Thursday\u2019s conference call, James said that Domo would pivot much of its sales focus to low-end enterprise customers, a switch that did not seem to sit well with some analysts.\n\nJames responded by saying that Domo is spending too much money and time wooing very large companies \u2014 those with more than $1 billion in revenue \u2014 but that it would continue some of those efforts.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re going to take a chunk of those reps and have them focus on the lower end of the enterprise space and we\u2019ll still have some out there that are that are out there hunting the big, you know, the really big logos and continuing to do what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d he said.\n\nSee also: Software companies are spending billions on acquisitions, but how long will it last?\n\nAs the call went on, the company\u2019s shares continued to fall. Domo executives continued to make excuses, citing the recent acquisitions of Looker by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOG, +2.54% GOOGL, +2.53% Google and Tableau by Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, +0.86% as adding temporary confusion, but saying they also will bring future opportunities in the market for cloud software.\n\nThe real problem, though, is that Domo doesn\u2019t seem to know what it is or wants to be \u2014 or just can\u2019t communicate that message. A muddled marketing plan and a strategy switch a year after going public are not good signs for the future, and Domo\u2019s future appears as cloudy as it gets.", "description": "When Domo Inc. went public last year, it was hard to discern what the company actually does, and how executives were going to turn it into a big business....", "authors": ["Therese Poletti"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK454_domo06_MG_20180606224359.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
