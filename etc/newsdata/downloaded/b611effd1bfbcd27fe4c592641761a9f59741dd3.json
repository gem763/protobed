More than 200 police officers have been injured and 171 vehicles damaged since the protests began last week.\n\nDemonstrators light fires following a week of protests over the jail sentences given to separatist politicians by Spain's Supreme Court, on October 19 in Barcelona.\n\nIn Chile, the military issued a curfew for the capital city of Santiago after prolonged demonstrations against a hike in public transport costs. Three people were killed in a supermarket fire in the city on Sunday.\n\nThe same day, an editorial in state-run tabloid Global Times accused Hong Kong demonstrators of \"exporting revolution to the world.\"\n\n\"The West is paying the price for supporting riots in Hong Kong, which has quickly kindled violence in other parts of the world and foreboded the political risks that the West can't manage,\" the editorial said.\n\nThe United States has repeatedly voiced support for the Hong Kong protesters, to the fury of the Chinese government.\n\nAnti-government demonstrators clash with police as they protest against cost of living increases on October 20 in Santiago, Chile.\n\nOn October 14, the US House of Representatives passed legislation in support of the Hong Kong activists which could see major financial penalties imposed on the major Chinese financial hub if Beijing cracks down on the city.\n\nIn a video editorial posted to the Global Times official Twitter on October 17, editor Hu Xijin suggested protests could spread throughout the West.\n\n\"There are many problems in the West and all kinds of undercurrents of dissatisfaction. Many of them will eventually manifest in the way the Hong Kong protests did,\" he said.\n\n\"Catalonia is probably just the beginning.\"\n\nThe subway line 4 was burned today during protests against an increase in metro fares in Santiago, Chile.

On October 12, a police officer was slashed in the neck while walking through a subway station, leading to two arrests. He was taken to hospital in a stable condition.\n\nThree days later, Jimmy Sham, a prominent protest march organizer, was attacked by a group of men wielding hammers and knives. He was left with wounds to the back of his skull and forehead.\n\nThere has been no sign of an end to the ongoing demonstrations, which started June to protest against a controversial China extradition treaty, but have since broadened to include calls for democracy.\n\nPolice fire tear gas to disperse protestors in Hong Kong on Sunday.\n\nIn a commentary published in People's Daily, the official Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, Fudan University academic Shen Yi accused the West of \"double standards\" in its responses to protests in other countries.\n\n\"We still remember that certain people in the West called the large demonstrations in Hong Kong 'a beautiful sight to behold',\" Shen wrote, before asking if those same commentators would support Catalan protests.\n\n\"If they don't, they are applying double standards to the Hong Kong and Catalonia problems.\"", "description": "Chinese state-run media has published a series of editorials and opinion pieces drawing parallels between violent protests in Hong Kong, Spain and Chile -- accusing the West of hypocrisy in its response.", "authors": ["Ben Westcott"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191021130127-02-hong-kong-protests-2010-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
