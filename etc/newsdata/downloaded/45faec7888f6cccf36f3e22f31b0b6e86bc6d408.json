Later in the book, Jamie spends time at an archaeological site named the Links of Noltland in her native Scotland. Buried for 5,000 years, the site is home to a recently exposed seaside settlement from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. As steady winds erode human remains and other evidence of communities that existed on the spot for 700 years, archaeologists race to save as much of it as they can. The subsistence farmers who lived here, Jamie writes, practiced \u201ca way of life that bound you inescapably.\u201d More than once, archaeologists tell her that these people \u201cjust got on with it\u201d\u2014the business of living.\n\n\u201cDoes this matter, is the question,\u201d Jamie wonders. \u201cDo we want to know how it was to be human, here, five thousand years ago? Do we want to know where we\u2019re coming from as we cruise into the future? What we were, or might be again? How we \u2018engaged,\u2019 if that\u2019s the word, how we configured our relationship with the rest of the natural world, with the planet.\u201d\n\nJamie appears content to let the reader answer these questions, and she moves on to essays about losing her parents, her bout with cancer, and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China. For Terry Tempest Williams, there is no moving on from such questions. The Utah-based conservationist\u2019s new book, Erosion: Essays of Undoing, reads like a longer, louder, and less searching book than Jamie\u2019s. \u201cWithout a respect for origins,\u201d Williams declares, \u201cthe human spirit falters.\u201d\n\nIn her impassioned collection of essays, poems, and interviews dating back to 2012, Williams returns often to the idea that in order to adapt to the climate crisis, everyone will need to understand \u201cwhat indigenous communities have always known, and are increasingly willing to share\u2014that we are one with the land, not apart from it.\u201d\n\nThe veteran nature writer Barry Lopez makes a similar argument in his recent, career-spanning book Horizon, and like him, Williams understands that her observations\u2014and, ultimately, her faith in humanity and optimism about its future\u2014come from a place of privilege. While everyone is experiencing the effects of climate change, it\u2019s easy to write \u201cOur undoing is also the making of our becoming\u201d when the ocean isn\u2019t lapping at your front door. \u201cI have the privilege of looking forward,\u201d Williams admits in Erosion, later adding, \u201cThis is who I am\u2014Boom! A white woman of privilege born of the Covenant\u2014I am not on the outside but inside.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019s impatience with subtlety, penchant for aphorisms (\u201cWilderness is a necessity, not a luxury\u201d; \u201cThe silence before us is time\u201d), and wide embrace of repetition threaten to dull the book\u2019s message early on. But the more she repeats her arguments\u2014sometimes within the same paragraph\u2014for saving public lands, standing up to the oil and gas industries, and building \u201canother world in the ashes of this one,\u201d the more effective Erosion becomes.", "description": "A pair of authors tries to maintain optimism about the world\u2019s changing landscapes\u2014but at what cost?", "authors": ["Jake Cline"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19182010887043/facebook.jpg?1569004802", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
