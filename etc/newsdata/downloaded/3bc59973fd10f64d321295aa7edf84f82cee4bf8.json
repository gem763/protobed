The slugger also joins New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge as the only rookies to hit the 50-homer mark. Judge hit 52 in 2017.\n\nSarah Langs of MLB.com tweeted that Alonso registered just the 46th 50-homer season in league history.\n\nThe 24-year-old Alonso joined the majors one year after a breakout 2018 minor league campaign in which he hit 36 dingers and knocked in 119 runners for the Double-A Binghamton Rumble Ponies and Triple-A Las Vegas 51s.\n\nThat's impressive enough at the minor league level, but Alonso has done even better in the bigs en route to helping keep the Mets in contention for a National League Wild Card.\n\nThe 79-73 Mets entered Friday 3.5 games behind the Milwaukee Brewers for the final National League wild-card spot.", "description": "New York Mets  first baseman  Pete Alonso  became the first major leaguer to hit 50 home runs this season and the second rookie to hit that mark in  MLB  history when he smacked a ...", "authors": ["Paul Kasabian"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/829/247/hi-res-23370f168df6ae2f5f8dd26c72d47f4b_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
