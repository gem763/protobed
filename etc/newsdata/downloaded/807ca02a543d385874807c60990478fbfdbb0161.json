The Chinese embassy in London said it was in close contact with the British police.\n\n\u201cThis is a shocking tragedy. We express our deep condolences to the families and friends of the victims,\u201d the embassy told Chinese media on Friday, adding that it expected the UK side would respect the dead and \u201cconduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Chinese state media criticised UK authorities for failing to prevent a repeat of a similar grisly scenario, when 58 Chinese citizens were found dead in a container in Dover, suffocated to death, in 2000.\n\nIn an editorial headlined, \u201cThe UK must bear responsibility,\u201d the often nationalist tabloid Global Times wrote: \u201cImagine what thorough measures European countries would take if dozens of Europeans died in the same way? Let me ask Britain and the European government why they failed to avoid a similar tragedy after the Dover tragedy? Did they take all the serious remedial action that they could have?\u201d\n\nAn outspoken commentator and editor of the Global Times, Hu Xijin wrote on the microblog Weibo on Thursday night: \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened,\u201d referring to the Dover deaths as well as when at least 21 Chinese migrants picking cockles drowned on the coast of the UK in 2004.\n\nTwo journeys into one: how lorry driver and Chinese nationals reached Essex Read more\n\nHe wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t know if these incidents are connected to the social governance of the UK, but these humanitarian disasters continue to happen in the UK \u2026 a simple question: why do these disasters always happen in the UK and not Europe or America?\u201d\n\nNews of the lorry deaths dominated debate on Chinese social media, with more than 800 million views and 40,000 comments. The news occupied three of the top 10 most discussed topics on Weibo, with internet users expressing confusion and disbelief.\n\n\u201cHeartbreaking. Even as I\u2019m typing now my hands are shaking. Please find out the truth,\u201d one user said, in response to reports that the victims may have frozen to death in the refrigerator unit, in temperatures as low as -25C (-13F). \u201cThis is horrifying. It deserves serious investigation and serious punishment,\u201d another wrote.\n\n\u201cWhy are people still risking their lives when China is constantly improving?\u201d one user said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe there is still such a large-scale of smuggling of Chinese to the UK,\u201d another said. \u201cLife in China is quite good now. Why are people still choosing to be smuggled? Do they think everything is free in other countries?\u201d one netizen responded.\n\nTian Ma, a research fellow at Utrecht University whose studies focus on Chinese victims of trafficking says a slowing Chinese economy could be pushing more people to make the journey. A prolonged trade war with the US as well as decreased spending within the country, has hit Chinese workers, farmers, and small and medium sized businesses the hardest.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental reason is the economic gap. That is the major pull factor. If you look at the average salary in the UK compared to small cities in China, the gap is huge,\u201d said Ma. \u201cBased on my research some are being trapped in debt bondage or because of a loan shark. They have been pushed to a point where they have to leave China.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A farmer pushes his tricycle loaded with firewood along a track on the outskirts of Beijing Photograph: David Gray/REUTERS\n\nYet, Chinese emigration is not always linked to poverty. Historically, Chinese migrants in Europe came from provinces such as Fujian and Guangdong, among the richest parts of the country \u2013 with illegal migration routes believed to have been established in the 1980s and 2000s by \u201csnakeheads\u201d Chinese organised criminal groups.\n\nIn some cases, people have been tricked into or coerced into making the trip. Smugglers often lure clients with offers of work in the destination country. Chinese women have traditionally been among the most affected. They made up the largest proportion of women held in immigration detention in the UK in 2018.\n\nChina-UK people trafficking often driven by debt, experts say Read more\n\n\u201cTheir stories of exploitation and abuse are among the most shocking I have ever heard in more than a decade of working with asylum seeking women,\u201d said Natasha Walter of Women for Refugee Women.\n\nAs authorities enforce migration controls more strictly and traditional channels are cut off, many turn to extreme measures. \u201cPeople turn to brokers or other facilitators when other more regular forms of movement aren\u2019t possible,\u201d said Jade Anderson, head of research at the Justice Centre in Hong Kong.\n\nResearchers say irregular Chinese migrants are especially vulnerable to human trafficking. Chinese men, women and children are exploited through forced labour and sex trafficking in at least 60 other countries, working in restaurants, agriculture, shops, factories, as well as brothels and massage parlours operated by overseas Chinese communities, according to the 2019 Trafficking in Persons Report by the US State Department. Many end up indebted to their traffickers or abused by employers in the destination country who exploit their illegal status.\n\nYet, little is known about trafficking and illegal migration from China to Europe. There are few Chinese NGOs and researchers working on the issue. Some critics say the Chinese government has shown little appetite in addressing the problem and that existing laws to prevent human trafficking are not enough.\n\n\u201cInstead of merely pointing the finger at the UK government, and accusing it of having not done enough to save the lives of the 39 people, the Chinese government should address the issue about why people from China would still take such a great risk to leave the country,\u201d said Patrick Poon, a researcher for Amnesty International\u2019s East Asia office.\n\nTo some Chinese, the incident has underlined how uneventhe country\u2019s economic growth has been, leaving it with one of the highest rates of inequality in the world. Days before the discovery of the 39 dead, Credit Suisse released a study showing that wealthy Chinese now outnumber their counterparts in the US.\n\n\u201cIllegal migration still exists. The gap between the rich and the poor in China is too wide, and good jobs are too hard to find. Tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people compete for a job as public servant, while the poor Chinese work for 4-5,000 yuan a month to support their parents and their children,\u201d one Weibo user said.\n\n\u201cIf they succeed [in migrating] they can earn a couple of thousands of pounds a month which more than tens of thousands of renminbi. So some people will take the risk.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Lillian Yang\n\n", "description": "British authorities criticised by nationalist paper as country voices shock at truck fatalities", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d75e2040fa245852c8b5afcac47f03f392a1ad7/0_69_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=49ff8bfcc01f57cb4f6203e56d26d1c4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
