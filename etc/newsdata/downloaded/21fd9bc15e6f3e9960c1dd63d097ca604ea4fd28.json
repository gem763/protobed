The Conception's wreckage currently remains on the seabed off the California coast.\n\nThe law being used, the Limitation of Liability Act, dates back to 1851 and has been invoked in past high profile maritime disasters such as the sinking of the Titanic, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.\n\nVictims' families will be told that they have six months to challenge Truth Aquatics' legal attempts to clear itself of any negligence, or to limit the liability to the current value of the boat, which is zero, the lawsuit said.\n\nNone of the victims' families have yet filed lawsuits against the owners, but crew members have submitted written notice that they may file for legal claims in the future, the document said.\n\nA firefighter responds to the Conception's boat fire off Santa Cruz Island on September 2.

They could let these people bury their kids. This is shocking.\"\n\nRobert J. Mongeluzzi, a maritime lawyer in Philadelphia, also told the Los Angeles Times: \"It is pretty heartless when not all the bodies have been recovered to file something saying their lives are worthless.\"\n\nMartin J. Davies, the maritime law director at Tulane University, said that invoking the Limitation of Liability Act is a common strategy after maritime disasters, but acknowledged that it often \"produces very unpleasant results.\"\n\n\"It seems like a pretty heartless thing to do, but that's what always happens. They're just protecting their position,\" Davies told the AP.\n\n\"It produces very unpleasant results in dramatic cases like this one. ... The optics are awful.\"\n\nRead more: A family of 5 on a birthday trip, a father-daughter duo who loved diving, and a marine biologist leading the scuba expedition are believed to be among the 34 California boat fire victims\n\nTruth Aquatics and its lawyers have not yet responded to Business Insider's request for comment on the lawsuit and the experts' remarks.\n\nJJ Lambert and Jenna Marsala hug after at a makeshift memorial near Truth Aquatics' offices in Santa Barbara, California, on September 2.

Of the 33 passengers and six crew members on board the ship, only five \u2014 the captain and four crew members \u2014 are believed to have survived.\n\nThe US Coast Guard suspended its search and rescue mission on Tuesday as all those still missing are presumed dead.\n\nThe cause of the fire remains unknown. The US Coast Guard on Tuesday said the boat had passed all its safety tests before it set sail.\n\nInvestigators at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told a Thursday press conference the five surviving crew members couldn't get to the passengers sleeping below the ship's hold because of the flames.\n\nThey also tried to open the doors of the galley to help the passengers escape, but were blocked by the fire, the NTSB said. They ended up having to jump from the boat to escape.\n\nRead more: Crew members who survived the California boat fire say they desperately tried to save passengers sleeping on the ship's lower deck\n\nInvestigators are now trying to piece together a timeline of the disaster. Maritime experts told the AP earlier this week the investigation could be marred by the fact that evidence may have burned or sunk to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nYou can read the lawsuit here.", "description": "The Conception diving boat caught on fire off Santa Cruz Island Monday.
