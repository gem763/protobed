They were rallying to call for broader political rights and police accountability, in the latest turmoil to grip the financial centre since early June.\n\nHong Kong is home to more than 300,000 Muslims, according to the Islamic Community Fund, which runs the city's five mosques and two Muslim cemeteries.

Pictured: Protestors set fire on a street to keep police back\n\nHong Kong streets once again descended into chaotic scenes over the weekend following an unauthorised pro-democracy rally on Sunday which was said to be attended by around 350,000 demonstrators.\n\nThe march was initially peaceful, but hard-line activists went on rampages shortly afterwards.\n\nProtesters set up roadblocks and torched businesses, and police responded with tear gas and a water cannon.\n\nProtesters threw firebombs and took their anger out on shops with mainland Chinese ties as they skirmished late into the evening with riot police, who unleashed numerous tear gas rounds on short notice, angering residents and passers-by.\n\nPolice had beefed up security measures before the rally, for which they refused to give permission, the latest chapter in the unrest that has disrupted life since early June.\n\nAs riot police advanced, protestors fell back to their next barricade, unlike past rallies when they stood and clashed with police by throwing petrol bombs and bricks. Pictured: Police arrive to chase away protestors\n\nBlack-clad protesters erected fiery barriers in the Kowloon district in a bid to hold back police as scores of riot police with shields marched towards them\n\nTwenty-four people were hurt and treated at hospitals, including six with serious injuries, the Hospital Authority said.\n\nPolice did not give an arrest figure. One person was seen being handcuffed and taken away to a police van.\n\nAs the rally march set off, protest leaders carried a black banner that read, 'Five main demands, not one less', as they pressed their calls for police accountability and political rights in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nSupporters sang the protest movement's anthem, waved colonial and US flags, and held up placards depicting the Chinese flag as a Nazi swastika.\n\nMany protesters wore masks in defiance of a recently introduced ban on face coverings at public gatherings, and volunteers handed more out to the crowd.\n\nPolice used several water cannon trucks to disperse protesters, spraying jets of blue dye into the crowds and sending hundreds fleeing\n\nPolice have used the blue dye to identify protesters. Pictured: a journalist reacts as the water cannons are used\n\nMatthew Lee, a university student, said he was determined to keep protesting even after more than four months.\n\n'I can see some people want to give up, but I don't want to do this because Hong Kong is my home, we want to protect this place, protect Hong Kong,' he said. 'You can't give up because Hong Kong is your home.'\n\nSome front-line protesters barricaded streets at multiple locations in Kowloon, where the city's subway operator restricted passenger access.\n\nThey tore up stones from the sidewalk and scattered them on the road, commandeered plastic safety barriers and unscrewed metal railings to form makeshift roadblocks.\n\nA water cannon truck and armoured car led a column of dozens of police vans up and down Nathan Road, a major artery lined with shops, to spray a stinging blue-dyed liquid as police moved to clear the road of protesters and barricades.\n\nIt was the heaviest use of water cannons by police and many people hit with the water developed coughs, suggesting an irritant may be mixed with the water\n\nProtestors threw petrol bombs at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station on Kowloon peninsula after police inside fired volleys of tear gas to disperse demonstrators on the street\n\nOne protester hits a tear gas canister with a tennis racket. By nightfall protestors had set fire to numerous road barriers and trashed shops in several Kowloon districts\n\nAt one point, the water cannon sprayed a handful of people standing outside the Kowloon Mosque. The Hong Kong police force said it was an 'unintended impact' of its operation to disperse protesters and later sent a representative to meet the mosque's imam.\n\nAs night fell, protesters returned to the streets, setting trash on fire at intersections.\n\nResidents jeered riot police, cursing at them and telling them to leave. The officers, in turn, warned people that they were part of an illegal assembly and told them to leave, and unleashed tear gas to disperse the crowds.\n\nAlong the way, protesters trashed discount grocery shops and a restaurant chain because of what they say is the pro-Beijing ownership of the companies.\n\nThey also set fire to ATMs and branches of mainland Chinese banks, setting off sprinklers in at least two, as well as a shop selling products from Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi.\n\nThe protest movement sprang out of opposition to a government proposal for an extradition bill that would have sent suspects to mainland China to stand trial, and then ballooned into broader demands for full democracy and an inquiry into alleged police brutality.", "description": "Hong Kong officials apologised to Muslim leaders today after riot police sprayed a mosque and bystanders with a water cannon while trying to contain pro-democracy demonstrations.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/19982434-0-image-a-8_1571647885822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
