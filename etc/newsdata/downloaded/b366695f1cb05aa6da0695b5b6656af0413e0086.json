The agreement was not set out in writing, and only in principle.\n\nOne of the sources told Bloomberg that Beijing could send a delegation led by top negotiator Vice Premier Liu He to put the final touches on a written deal in time for a signing at next month\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation presidents meeting in Chile. And another source said China wants the planned tariffs for December by the U.S. to be scrapped as well as a tariff hike meant to go through this week.\n\nNo decision has been made yet on planned on a new 15% tariff set to go into effect on Dec. 15 on about $160 billion in annual Chinese imports.\n\n\u201c\u2019Phase two\u2019 could be discussed in the coming weeks and months, suggesting December tariffs are likely to be suspended as well, but we do not expect a grand agreement or a rollback of existing tariffs this year. Both sides remain far apart on many thornier issues and last week\u2019s agreement really only reinforced actions China has already been taking,\u201d said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy for the Dynamic Solutions unit of Natixis Investment Managers\n\nThe news hit U.S. stock futures, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00, -0.31% off 123 points, or 0.5%, to 26,653, S&P 500 futures ES00, -0.33% off 15.05 points, or 0.5%, to 2,956 and Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00, -0.38% siding 46.50, or 0.6%, to 7,814.
