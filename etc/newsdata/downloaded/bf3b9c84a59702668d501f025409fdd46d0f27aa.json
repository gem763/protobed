The company assured there would be \u201cno disruption\u201d to medical, dental and prescription drug coverage.\n\nThe move amounts to an about-face by Detroit-based GM, which said last week that the United Auto Workers union would have to fund COBRA benefits until the work stoppage ended.\n\nThat earlier decision by GM \u2015 which turned into national news \u2015 created a wave of anxiety among employees who feared a lapse in coverage. Labor leaders and politicians hammered the company for what appeared to be a hardball bargaining tactic two days into the strike.\n\nThe UAW did not let up its criticism even after GM reversed course Thursday. The union\u2019s lead negotiator on the GM contract, Vice President Terry Dittes, sent a letter to the company accusing it of \u201ctoying with the lives of hundreds of thousands of our UAW families.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that public sentiment sees these actions of GM as a shameful act!\u201d Dittes wrote.\n\nThe company declined to say how long it intended to fund the health care benefits if the strike continues for weeks. The stoppage had entered its 11th day on Thursday, with no clear end in sight. It is possible if the strike persists the company could decide again to force the union to pay for benefits out of its strike fund.\n\nDittes said Wednesday that the UAW was waiting on a response from GM on the union\u2019s latest proposals and that \u201cthe back and forth will continue\u201d until everything is resolved. The union and the company had been far apart on key issues, including the wage scale for newer hires, the company\u2019s use of temporary workers, and the share of health care costs borne by employees.\n\nThe strike involves nearly 50,000 workers at more than 50 GM facilities around the country.\n\nThe UAW is also negotiating new contracts this year with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, the other members of the Big Three. The union chose to bargain first with GM, extending its previous contracts with the other two automakers. UAW leadership called for a strike at GM starting Sept. 16 after workers\u2019 contract there expired.\n\nAs HuffPost reported in July, the negotiations for a new four-year contract were expected to be the most difficult in more than a decade. Workers are expecting to make significant gains after sacrificing to prop up the company around the time of the financial crisis. GM, meanwhile, wants to keep labor costs down as auto sales slow.\n\nAs one GM worker previously told HuffPost, \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to give back.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nUnited Auto Workers Calls For Strike At General Motors\n\nMassive Strike Hits General Motors As 46,000 Workers Walk Off\n\nThe Real Reason General Motors Workers Are On Strike Nationwide\n\nLove HuffPost?
