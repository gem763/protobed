Gen. Michael Flynn who accuses prosecutors of withholding evidence.\n\nMs. Powell makes the sensational allegation the two phones were used by Mr. Mifsud as part of a Western intelligence gambit to entrap Flynn into connections with certain Russians.\n\nIf true, it could turn the Justice Department probe on its head because it wrecks the entire reason for opening the investigation.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr has ordered an inquiry into how the FBI opened the probe. It is possible the Mifsud phones were recovered during that process.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller and former FBI Director James Comey both said that Mr. Mifsud was a Russian asset who spoke with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.\n\nDuring an encounter in London, Mr. Mifsud told Papadopoulos that Moscow owned thousands of Hillary Clinton emails. Papadopoulos passed the information on to the Australian ambassador while having a drink in a wine bar. The information was conveyed to Washington, triggering the FBI to open a probe on July 31, 2016.\n\nPapadopoulos argues that Mr. Mifsud worked for Western intelligence, not Russia, and planted the tidbit to entrap him. Mr. Mifsud has remained out of sight for months.\n\nMs. Powell\u2019s motion in U.S. District Court states that \u201cagents that western intelligence tasked against him [Flynn] likely as early as 2014 to arrange \u2014 unbeknownst to him \u2014 \u2018connections\u2019 with certain Russians that they would then use against him in their false claims. The phones were used by Mr. Joseph Mifsud.\u201d\n\nThe timeline of acquiring the phones would mean Mr. Mueller\u2019s team didn\u2019t have them during the investigation.\n\nFlynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about discussions he had with the Russian ambassador. The talks were not connected to Russian election interference. Flynn was not charged in any Russian conspiracy, nor were any other Trump associates.\n\nFlynn has not yet been sentenced. He fired his lawyers last spring and brought on Ms. Powell, a Dallas appeals specialist.\n\nShe has been petitioning Judge Emmet G. Sullivan to force the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for D.C. to turn over what she considers \u201cBrady\u201d material. It is a reference to a Supreme Court case that requires the government to turn over all exculpatory evidence.\n\nEarly on, Judge Sullivan ordered prosecutors to adhere to Brady. If the judge finds that prosecutors did not, Ms. Powell wants the entire case thrown out.\n\nHer Tuesday motion lists both BlackBerrys\u2019 model numbers, PIN and SIM card identification. She wants the data from the phones turned over to the defense.\n\n\u201cThis information is material, exculpatory, and relevant to the defense of Mr. Flynn, and specifically to the \u201cOCONUS LURES,\u201d Ms. Powell\u2019s motion states.\n\n\u201cOCONUS LURES\u201d is FBI lingo for enticing someone outside the U.S. to return so the person can be detained.\n\nFBI Agent Peter Strzok used the acronym in December 2015 when texting his lover, FBI counsel Lisa Page. There is no indication he was talking about then-candidate Trump.\n\nMr. Mifsud traveled extensively in Europe as a classroom teacher and conference lecturer. Among his posts was the Link University in Rome. The campus teaches NATO intelligence officers and is staffed by former Western intelligence agents.\n\nMr. Barr visited Rome several weeks ago on a trip tied to his inquiry into how the FBI began the probe and whether it violated federal law.\n\nMr. Papadopoulos tweeted, \u201cBOTH Mifsud and Halper were tasked with spying on Flynn and myself. This is a major breakthrough!\u201d\n\n\u201cHalper\u201d is Stefan Halper, a Washington and London-based professor who was an FBI informant assigned to spy on Mr. Papadopoulos and other Trump figures.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
