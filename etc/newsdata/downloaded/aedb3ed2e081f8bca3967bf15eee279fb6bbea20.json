It posted revenue of C$98.9 million ($74.95 million), below the C$108.3 million that analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nMatt Markiewicz, managing director of The Cannabis ETF which invests in Aurora, called the company's results a \"mixed bag\" and said that given the uncertain outlook heading into the fourth quarter the stock would be volatile for the next few days. (http://bit.ly/2khP6tO)\n\nAurora said the average net selling price of cannabis fell by C$1.08 per gram to C$5.32 per gram in the fourth quarter from the third, primarily due to an increase in sales to recreational and wholesale markets that yield lower prices than medical markets.\n\nThe Edmonton, Alberta-based company sold 17,793 kgs of cannabis in the quarter ended June 30, up from 9,160 kgs in the preceding quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Debroop Roy and Taru Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Stephen Coates)", "description": "Canada became the first G7 country to legalize recreational marijuana late last year but sales have been dampened by supply constraints and higher prices than those on the black market.  \"We provided that guidance ... because we assumed there would be a more aggressive roll-out of retail outlets", "authors": ["Debroop Roy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WgzkXaeIbQ1b3FUVgD2fWg--~B/aD0yOTk7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/de5148e325bed8022f9898f66e1c27cf", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
