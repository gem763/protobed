Spice is not a single substance and can be one or a mixture of more than 100 subtly different man-made chemicals, making testing for it difficult.\n\nThis means a precautionary approach is often followed for such patients, which may not be the optimal course of treatment, scientists say. Those undergoing temporary psychosis due to Spice may also be admitted to a psychiatric ward.\n\nChris Pudney, Jenny Scott and Stephen Husbands with the first developed simple saliva test to detect if a person has recently taken the psychoactive drug Spice (PA)\n\nDr Chris Pudney, at the University of Bath, described results as \u201csimple and very accurate\u201d and easy to understand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My partner is a psychiatrist and she was telling me that currently they don\u2019t have a way to confirm when they suspect Spice use, they just don\u2019t know for sure,\u2019 Dr Pudney said.\n\n\u2018You can test for it with a urine or blood sample that is sent off to a lab, but that takes a few days and so in most cases it\u2019s pointless. I started looking into the chemistry and it\u2019s actually similar to something we have developed for detection of biological molecules.\n\n\u2018We decided on saliva because it seemed tractable and less invasive than some other options.\u2019\n\nThe test can be performed on the spot and identifies whether synthetic cannabinoids have been smoked and if so, at what concentration. (PA)\n\nDr Pudney contacted colleagues at the university\u2019s Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Department of Computer Science, to explore developing the device. The university hosted a session with representatives from the NHS, drug charities and homeless charities.\n\nTo conduct the test, a saliva sample is taken from the patient and put into a small clear tube. This tube is placed into the machine, which then uses light to scan for the \u2018fingerprint\u2019 of a Spice compound.\n\nWithin five minutes, the result comes up on a screen linked to the device. Dr Jenny Scott, of the Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, said: \u201cSpice can be used to \u2018zombify\u2019 people, escaping them from the reality in which they find themselves, making them highly vulnerable.\n\n\u2018Two thirds of prison governors report concern about new psychoactive substances use in their prisons, including spice. Use of spice and other synthetic cannabinoids is estimated at about 10% among prisoners, and has placed a strain on emergency healthcare.\u2019\n\nSpice is a drug known to \u2018zombify\u2019 people (PA)\n\n\u2018Our collaborative research work with homeless people who use drugs has found spice is commonly taken by them also. Detection and confirmation of spice use early on when someone is found incoherent gives a chance to start timely treatment for their symptoms.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Further down the line, we can foresee the kit being used as part of a care pathway that avoids the need to hospitalise some patients if appropriate healthcare can be given where they are.\u2019\n\nIt is hoped that medical professionals will be able to trial the device within a year.
