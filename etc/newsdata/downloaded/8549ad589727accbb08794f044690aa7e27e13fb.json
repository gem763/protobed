I don\u2019t know why anybody would put money into the U.S. dollar, and by extension into the U.S.\u201d\n\nNeed I say it? Yes, I do. Since then, U.S. stocks DJIA, +0.57% have outperformed everything in sight, and the U.S. dollar index DXY, -0.31%, which bottomed at 80 in July 2011, now trades near 100.\n\nIn fact, the period since the financial crisis has seen the U.S. dollar become even more dominant, according to research by Brent Neiman of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Matteo Maggiori of Stanford University, and Jesse M. Schrager of Columbia Business School. That growing strength has shown up in global capital flows, ownership of dollar-denominated assets and as a barometer of investors\u2019 appetite for risk.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. dollar\u2019s role as an international and safe-haven currency has surged since the global financial crisis,\u201d the authors write, so that today it appears to be \u201cthe world\u2019s only international currency.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, prominent economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University wrote that by some measures \u201cits use is far wider today than 70 years ago,\u201d when the Bretton Woods Conference established the postwar international monetary system.\n\nWhy has that happened? One reason was the eurozone crisis, which raised serious concerns about the euro\u2019s future. Only the vow by former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to \u201cdo whatever it takes to preserve the euro\u201d prevented a collapse of the common currency. Global investors and businesses did the prudent thing and moved money out of the euro EURUSD, +0.3544% and into the greenback.\n\nSo, since 2005, the share of cross-border holdings of corporate debt denominated in dollars jumped from roughly 45% to 70%, while the share in euros plunged from around 35% to 20%. And the euro\u2019s value against the dollar has slid about 30% from July 2008, when one euro was worth $1.60, until now, when it gets only $1.10.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the whole story, Chicago Booth\u2019s Brent Neiman told me in a phone interview. He said \u201calmost the definition\u201d of a safe asset \u201cis that it performs well, appreciates in value, during times when other assets are not doing well, that in times when you most need it to perform well, it does do well.\u201d\n\nDuring the financial and eurozone crises, there was \u201chard evidence that the dollar did indeed function like an international or global currency, like a safe asset,\u201d Neiman continued. \u201cAnd having passed the test, the world essentially congealed around that view subsequently.\u201d\n\nThus was the dollar was able to recapture the \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d it had during its postwar reign on the top of the currency heap.\n\nWill it continue? Neiman points out that the dollar has enormous structural advantages \u2014 like the number of cross-border deals done in dollars, even by many countries that have their own currencies, and the dominance of the dollar in derivatives markets, where companies and investors do a lot of hedging.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Chinese renminbi USDCNY, -0.2178%, also called the yuan, has an uphill battle to displace the dollar as a global currency, a prospect that looks even more remote amid trade wars and growing protests over Hong Kong and China\u2019s persecution of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. \u201cSome of the structural impediments to greater global currency use of the renminbi\u2026.do seem quite slow-moving and difficult to change,\u201c Neiman told me.\n\nTo me, that means the dominance of dollar-denominated assets will continue, especially as the U.S. economy keeps growing (albeit more slowly) and U.S. interest rates remain positive, while many European and Japanese bond yields move deeper into negative territory. I still like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index ETF VTI, +0.64% and various intermediate- to long-term all-U.S. bond funds, like the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond ETF BIV, -0.32% and the iShares 10-20 Year Treasury Bond ETF TLH, -1.04%.\n\nThe only thing that concerns me \u2014 which is why I\u2019m keeping some money in a global stock fund \u2014 is that capitulation by investors like Rogers may be a signal the dollar is finally topping out.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be ironic if he\u2019s inadvertently ringing the bell at the top of the market and will now be hit just as hard by the dollar\u2019s retreat as he was by completely missing its long, long advance, while he placed his bets anywhere else but the U.S.A.?\n\nHoward R.
