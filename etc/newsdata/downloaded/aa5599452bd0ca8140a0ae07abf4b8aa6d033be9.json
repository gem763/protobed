Fuming. Confused. And also \u2013 on a really basic level \u2013 it really hurt my feelings.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018I step on stage every night and give every part of me.

There\u2019s a deep amount of trust there.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I step on stage every night with a deep reverence for the stage, my craft, and the privilege that is making music for my job. I\u2019ve been writing and producing music for 10 years \u2013 my body is my greatest tool for communicating that work.\u2019\n\nSetting clear boundaries, the Burning singer continued: \u2018I want to use this moment to be moment to be very very clear. There is no space for harassment or disrespect or degradation of any kind at my show.\u2019\n\n\u2018Be kind to each other out there,\u2019 she ended the message.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry Maggie. I know how much you love music and I cannot imagine how much joy that space on stage brings you but also the vulnerability that comes with it.
