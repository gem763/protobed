Trump rage-tweeted Sunday that Schiff\u2019s \u201clies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason..... .\u201d On Monday morning, Trump upped that outrageous demand by suggesting that Schiff actually be arrested for treason.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt has become so easy to dismiss such comments as hyperbole and bluster \u2014 just Trump being Trump \u2014 that we risk losing sight of how dangerous, how fundamentally un-American they are.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution took great care in spelling out what acts could be regarded as treason, which was the only crime they explicitly defined. Article III, Section 3 states that \u201cTreason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.\u201d\n\nWhy did the framers believe treason, alone among offenses, merited such clarity in the nation\u2019s founding document? Their recent history had given them reason to fear authoritarians who would loosely throw around accusations of treason. The parameters of the crime under British law were broad and vague, and could be stretched to include counterfeiting or sleeping with a member of the royal family, says Jason Opal, a professor of American history at McGill University. The royal governors of the 13 colonies invoked treason as a handy means of crushing dissent and executing those who objected to the crown\u2019s rule.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the framers set out to devise a legal system for the new nation, they borrowed much from British law and traditions. But they felt strongly that \u201ctreason\u201d should have a precise, fixed and uniquely American meaning. Madison wrote in Federalist No. 43: \u201cAs new-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime.\u201d\n\nThe president, as he is showing us, is the \u201calternate malignity\u201d that Madison feared. Trump took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He should start by learning what is in it.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGeorge T.
