Dahua Technologies, meanwhile, has more than 16,000 employees according to its website, and has offices in North America, Europe, and Latin America.\n\nThe Trump administration had been considering whether to add Hikvision to its Entity list since May, but did not make an official decision until Monday.\n\nThe six remaining technology companies added to the trade blacklist are IFLYTEK, Megvii Technology, Sense Time, Xiamen Meiya Pico Information, Yitu Technologies, and Yixin Science and Technology.\n\nThe entities were added to the blacklist as they are allegedly involved \"in human rights violations and abuses [related to] the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups\" in the Xinjuan region.\n\nWhile the government filing did not specify what actions the entities have committed, it said that their activities are \"contrary to the foreign policy of the United States\".\n\nChina has faced growing condemnation for its treatment of Uyghur Muslims and other Muslim minorities, with numerous reports stating that Chinese authorities have been tracking the movements of these people. There have also been reports of other human rights abuses, such as the installation of spyware on the phones of Uyghur Muslim and placing Uyghur Muslims into \"re-education\" camps.\n\n\"The US Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\" US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said on Monday.\n\n\"This action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenceless minority populations.\"\n\nThe newest Entity List additions are the latest among many that the US has made against Chinese businesses, including Huawei, which was placed on the Entity List back in May. Huawei can still trade with US companies until November however, as it was given a temporary licence to conduct trade where it is for the purpose of \"maintain[ing] and support[ing] existing and currently fully operational networks and equipment, including software updates and patches\".\n\nThere are currently over 100 Chinese entities that have been added to the US trade blacklist.\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "HikVision and Dahua, two of the world's largest manufacturers of surveillance technology, are among those that have been blacklisted.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/19/d44d1833-d898-4bed-921b-3b508355c592/thumbnail/770x578/b19e4ecb79d2a95d303c23735822041e/istock-1160711324.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
