And the festival's top award does so better than counterparts around the world, including the prestigious Festival de Cannes.\n\nThe numbers don't lie. And no matter which metric is used, TIFF comes out on top.\n\nSince 2000, movies that won the People's Choice Award at TIFF earned in total more than $3-billion US worldwide, compared to films that won Cannes' Palme d'Or, which made over $815-million, according to the movie industry database The Numbers.\n\nDiversity is good for business\n\nIn recent years, TIFF has emerged as the festival with the best crystal ball for predicting Oscar wins. Its top prize winners have garnered 102 Academy Award nominations and 36 Oscar wins since 2000 \u2014 five times more wins and nods than Cannes films.\n\nBut it's the astounding difference in movie revenues that inspired Nouman Ashraf, assistant professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, to use TIFF as a case study on why diversity is good for business.\n\nTurns out, the secret to TIFF's box-office superpower may just be Toronto's diverse population. After all, the top prize is an audience award chosen by the people of Toronto.\n\n\"They represent a global audience,\" Ashraf said. \"When they actually pick what resonates with them, what they're doing is they're giving a proxy vote for what will in fact resonate with a global audience literally across the globe.\"\n\nNouman Ashraf, assistant professor at the University of Toronto, says TIFF is not only making an economic contribution to the city, but a cultural contribution to Canada and the film industry. (CBC)\n\nHere's where this story turns into a lesson in Grade 8 social studies.\n\nCanada is a mosaic. And Toronto is among the most diverse cities in the world. More than half the population of Toronto identifies as visible minority \u2014 higher than New York City or London.\n\nTIFF's artistic director and co-head Cameron Bailey said the festival itself aims to be inclusive, both in the screening selection and in making the tickets accessible to the public.\n\nArtistic director Cameron Bailey says TIFF has always a 'festival for the people.' It was designed as a festival that would bring some of the glamour of Cannes to a public audience in a big city. (Nigel Hunt/CBC)\n\n\"This is a festival for the people \u2014 Toronto in all its glory,\" he said. \"I see people of different ages and shades and sizes and backgrounds watching movies together. That collective experience in a movie theatre is still really important to us \u2014 it's the core of who we are.\"\n\nAudience vs. jury award\n\nTIFF's audience prize was first awarded in 1978, with the winner based on the votes of people attending screenings. Anyone who attends a film at the festival can vote on the People's Choice Award winner.\n\nThe Palme d'Or, by contrast, is selected by an elite jury of artists. Past presidents include art-house darlings Wong Kar-Wai, David Lynch and David Cronenberg.\n\nBy definition, TIFF winners are more \"commercial\" than their counterparts at Cannes.\n\nAnd the box-office gap widens even more when we look at a third film festival for comparison \u2014 the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nWATCH: A quick comparison of TIFF vs. Cannes vs. Sundance\n\nCheck out how TIFF winners' box office and awards compare to Sundance and Cannes. 0:58\n\nAdmittedly, the Sundance and TIFF festivals are very different from one another, though the same films routinely screen at both festivals.\n\nLike TIFF, Sundance also has an audience award. Winners of that award have collectively earned under $300-million since 2000, which is even less than Palme d'Or winners.\n\nThe makeup of the Sundance audience may be to blame.\n\nSundance takes place in Park City, Utah \u2014 a small city east of Salt Lake City with a population under 10,000.\n\nPrecious executive producer Lisa Cort\u00e9s said, 'I think TIFF is definitely a people's festival.' (Luciana Pampalone)\n\nFestival goers have to fly in to attend screenings, making the audience a self-selected group of indie film lovers who also have the money and time to travel.\n\nBy contrast, TIFF is famous for its affordable and accessible rush tickets \u2014 another factor in the audience's diversity.\n\nOne of the producers of Precious, the 2009 Oscar-winning film that screened at all three festivals, remembers the glitz and glamour of all three red carpet events.\n\nBut at TIFF, what stood out for Lisa Cort\u00e9s was the people \u2014 Canadians.\n\n\"I think TIFF is definitely a people's festival,\" Cort\u00e9s recalled.\n\n\"I've always enjoyed the folks I've met while I've been waiting in line to see films \u2014 people who live in Toronto and live in Canada and said, 'You know, we took the week off so that we could come to this festival.'\"\n\n\"I think that really speaks to the love of cinema and the great curation that happens at TIFF with a broad range of films they present,\" she said.\n\nWhen his film Precious won the 2009 People's Choice Award at TIFF, director Lee Daniels, left, dedicated the win to festival co-director Bailey, right, for his support of the filmmaker over the years.
