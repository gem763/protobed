When a tradie turns up to install Mark and Mitch\u2019s barbecue she on it like a seagull on a chip, demanding to know why they still have trades on site despite being broke.\n\nRELATED:\n\nEpisode 50 recap: Block budgeting goodie goodies go bankrupt\n\nFailed auction a big warning sign for The Block\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been stalked for the past six weeks about my budget and they haven\u2019t,\u201d she complains before confronting Mitch about his rogue tradie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get to the bottom of it because it feels like Luke and I have been playing by different rules.\u201d\n\nWhen Mitch explains the tradie came with the barbecue, which he and Mitch have already paid for, she\u2019s still not satisfied.\n\n\u201cLuke and I have been in the spotlight for budget for five weeks. We had Scott Cam come in twice to get us to send trades home.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fairly safe to say nobody saw Mark and Mitch\u2019s predicament coming. They won a $5000 \u2018savvy savers\u2019 prize \u2013 among their $35,000 in other cash bonuses \u2013 for crying out loud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted,\u201d Cam tells the pair, before suggesting they hold a fire sale of artworks.\n\nWhen he heads next door to Tess and Luke, he expects them to be pleased not to be the broke ones, but instead he arrives to a wave of complaints. Tess, and some of the other contestants, think it stinks that Mark and Mitch were able to fill their house with tradies and spend up big to win rooms, without anyone stepping in to have them ease off because they were going to run out of money.\n\n\u201cOf course they\u2019re going to be winning rooms and smashing it every week when they have 20 people on site,\u201d El\u2019ise says.\n\nBut Scott says the enormous unexpected bills only arrived this week. Up until this point, they, and the producers, thought Mitch and Mark were flush with cash. And they won\u2019t be allowed to put their house up for auction until they pay every last invoice.\n\nAnd as for Tess\u2019s complaining\u2026\n\n\u201cWe did you a favour!\u201d Scott says, pointing out that if he hadn\u2019t intervened and had them send trades home earlier in the season, they would be equally bankrupt now.\n\nAnd he won\u2019t brook any argument. When Luke and Tess complain they still don\u2019t have a finished house because there\u2019s some skirting boards and other things to attend to, Scott begins to see red.\n\n\u201cMate, you\u2019re a carpenter. Finish the bloody house,\u201d he snaps.\n\nIt was an interesting exchange in light of the couple last week blasting the show in an interview with news.com.au, claiming they\u2019d been unfairly portrayed as lazy.\n\nMeanwhile, next door, Andy and Deb have quietly accumulated $33,000, but even so, they\u2019re planning a simple roof terrace to save their cash for the final room \u2013 the front garden.\n\nMatt and El\u2019ise have high hopes of securing their first win in 10 weeks. They\u2019re the only team doing anything other than basic plastering and painting in their garage. They\u2019re adding tiled skirting boards, a painted floor, storage units and a mural. Talk about over-capitalisation.\n\nJesse and Mel are also sitting pretty. They\u2019re so relaxed Jesse gives his former enemy Mitch a lesson in tile cutting. Keith has been making a ham-fisted job of it, using a brick cutter to slice the porcelain tiles. Even when Jesse intervenes and shows Mitch the right way to do it, Keith remains blissfully ignorant of the fact Jesse is a qualified tiler. It\u2019s looking more and more likely this season will end with him none the wiser.\n\nThe tile lesson ends with a Jesse and Mitch hug. Who\u2019d have thought.\n\n\u201cJesse and I have a strong bond because we\u2019re both tilers,\u201d Mitch says.\n\nHis partner Mark isn\u2019t so chipper. His day of begging for tradies to cut their bills has left him upset and embarrassed.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve let people down. Everyone on the team who worked so hard to get this close,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to feel sorry for him. He and Mitch have been unbearably cocky at times, but no Block fan wants to see the first non-completion in the show\u2019s history.\n\nMISSED AN EPISODE?\n\n\n\nEP 50 recap: Block budgeting goodie goodies go bankrupt\n\n\n\nEP 49 recap: Block room \u2018looks like a public toilet\u2019\n\nEP 47/48 recap: Tess and Luke\u2019s marriage fears\n\n\n\nEP 46: Mitch and Jesse go head to head\n\n\n\nEP 45 recap: Judges slam pathetic balcony\n\n\n\n\n\nEP 43/44 recap: Has Mel had enough of her \u2018worst boyfriend\u2019\n\nEP 42 recap: Scott Cam blows his stack at contestant\n\n\n\nEP 41 recap: Room brings Shaynna Blaze to tears\n\n\n\nEP 39/40 recap: Tess and Luke finally run out of cash\n\n\n\nEP 38 recap: Mark and Mitch blow their stacks\n\nEP 37 recap: Will Tess and Luke walk out?\n\n\n\nEP 35 and 36 recap: Reason for Tess and Luke\u2019s devastation\n\nEP 34 recap: Mitch puts his foot through the ceiling\n\nEP 32 recap: producer dragged into cheating scandal\n\n\n\nEP 30 recap: \u2018Dog\u2019s breakfast\u2019: kitchen savagely mocked\n\nEP 29 recap: Scott Cam gives contestants a serve\n\nEP 27/28 recap: Gloves are off as teams threaten to quit\n\nEP 26 recap: Tess and Luke flush another tradie\n\nEP 25 recap: Is this the best bathroom on the Block ever?\n\nEP 24 recap: Is this the best Block bathroom ever?\n\nEP 23 recap: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u201d \u2013 Mark and Mitch patch things up with Scott\n\n\n\nEP 22 recap: What made Scott Cam storm off?\n\nEP 21 recap: Homophobia row rocks The Block\n\n\n\nEP 19/ 20 recap: \u2018you just told me my baby is ugly\u2019\n\nEP 18 recap: Tess\u2019 expletive-filled tirade after tradie sacking\n\nEP 17 recap: Loo controversy sinks two teams\n\nEP 15/16 recap: What made Mitch snap?\n\nEP 14 recap: Jesse and Keith\u2019s blow up\n\nEP 13 recap: Judges slam Mark and Mitch\n\nEP 11/12: Big move may blow up friendship\n\nEP 10 recap: Why Scott Cam locked a contestant in car\n\nEP 9 recap: How Jesse insulted Shaynna\n\nEP 7/8: \u2018Don\u2019t be nice to them\u2019.
