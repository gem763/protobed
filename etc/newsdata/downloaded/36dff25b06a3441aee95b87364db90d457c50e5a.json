John Kasich (R-OH) said Republican lawmakers should be calling for the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump to continue.\n\nCooper asked, \u201cGovernor, Kasich what\u2019s if going to take for other Republicans on the Hill to actually speak their minds on this? Assuming that there are some who, you know, believe what the president did was wrong that it was wrong to ask China to investigate the Bidens, a repressive regime like China not known for their fair and impartial investigations at the very least, is it going to take just them sensing a groundswell among Republican voters?\u201d\n\nKasich said,\u201dI think so, Anderson. Look, this is the thing that I have a hard time understanding. We know how bad this is. We know what the president did was wrong. Why wouldn\u2019t everybody want to get to the bottom of this?\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf the United States was withholding something that was critical to Ukraine, who had Russians located inside of their country, and gobbling up pieces of territory, you would think that they would say: \u2018Of course we should have an inquiry. Of course we should get to the bottom of this.\u2019 And as we see here as every report, every day, there is just more and more connections that are so troubling. But the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to have this inquiry. And frankly these Republicans ought to be calling for it. It\u2019s the fair and right thing to do for America.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On\u00a0Tuesday's broadcast of\u00a0CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360,\"\u00a0former Gov.
