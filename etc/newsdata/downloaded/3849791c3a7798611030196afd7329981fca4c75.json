WTI was down 6% for the week, its biggest decline since July.\n\n\u201cThe supply side of the equation will continue to weigh on oil as full Saudi Arabia production returns much faster than expected,\u201d Halley said.\n\nWeak U.S. services sector and jobs growth data on Thursday added to worries about global oil demand and exacerbated fears that a protracted U.S.-China trade war could push the global economy into a recession.\n\n\u201cConcerns about global oil demand are rising, and next week\u2019s U.S.-China trade talks, the significant X factor, will be particularly important, given the sharp drop in the oil price over the last week,\u201d said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiTrader.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, also said on Thursday the world\u2019s top crude oil exporter has fully restored oil output after attacks on its facilities last month knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply.\n\nRecent data showing a slowdown in U.S. shale output and drilling activity, however, could lend some support.\n\n\u201cContinued falls in drilling activity has seen monthly growth in U.S. shale oil output fall, from 150 thousand barrels per day (kbpd) to only 50 kbpd,\u201d said ANZ Bank on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to linger well into 2020.\u201d", "description": "Oil futures were higher ahead of the weekend but remained on track for large weekly losses on fears that slower global economic growth will hurt fuel demand, even as Saudi Arabia said it has fully restored oil output after recent attacks.", "authors": ["Roslan Khasawneh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436859938&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9303A", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
