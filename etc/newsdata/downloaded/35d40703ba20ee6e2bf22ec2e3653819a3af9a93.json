How Leicester\u2019s defence thrived despite selling \u00a380m Maguire", "language": "en", "text": "Heard the one about the club who sold their most prized centre-back for \u00a380m, did not buy a replacement and ended up with the best defence in the Premier League? Well, keep it to yourselves for a while because it is too early for punchlines and you do not want to advise Leicester to go laughing all the way to the bank just yet. But they are certainly entitled to smile as they prepare for Saturday\u2019s trip to Liverpool, the only team in the league with a plausible claim to have a better back four than Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side.\n\nTo say that Leicester have looked stronger since the departure of Harry Maguire is not to besmirch the England defender, a deserved high-achiever. Rather it is to celebrate two positives: the impact made at Leicester by his direct successor, Caglar Soyuncu; and the fact Soyuncu has stepped into a much more helpful environment than the one that Maguire is trying to make sense of at Old Trafford.\n\nDennis Praet: \u2018I started at Leicester with somebody else\u2019s boots\u2019 Read more\n\nThat, of course, leads to another point, which is that of the many bad decisions made by Manchester United in recent years, selling Jonny Evans to West Brom for \u00a36m in 2015 was among the worst. Buying the Northern Ireland international from West Brom for \u00a33.5m last year was one of many shrewd ones made by Leicester. A month after that purchase they bought Soyuncu for \u00a319m from Freiburg and now that, too, looks a canny deal. Ricardo Pereira arrived around the same time as Evans and Soyuncu and can now be ranked with Ben Chilwell as one the best full-backs in the Premier League. Leicester have a rearguard to be reckoned with.\n\nIt was not obvious that things would play out so well. If United had not waited until just before the closure of the transfer window to stump up the money for Maguire, Leicester would probably have signed another centre-back. Instead, rather than rush to buy, they decided to give Soyuncu a chance to prove his worth. He has seized it.\n\nDuring his four league starts last season it was clear he had a lot of potential but also a certain erraticism. After his first match this term \u2013 the 0-0 draw with Wolves \u2013 he was flawless and returned to the dressing room to be greeted with a standing ovation from his teammates. The other players knew the pressure that the 23-year-old had been under as the world watched to see how Leicester would cope without Maguire. Their applause showed he had earned the players\u2019 confidence and they wanted to give him some back.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThere has been no trace of impostor syndrome from Soyuncu. On the contrary, the young Turk has defended with admirable assertiveness, commanding in the air and vigilant in his marking and tackling. And his elan on the ball flirts with the outrageous. Rodgers said this season that the player needs to measure his risk-taking but, at the same time, the manager could not help grinning as he referred to the \u201cwee maverick things\u201d that Soyuncu likes to do: highlights from this season include dribbling past Bournemouth\u2019s Callum and Harry Wilson in his own area or dancing around Tanguy Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 in a way that left Tottenham\u2019s record signing sprawled on the grass like a sprinter who trod on a roller skate. Leicester fans have fallen in love.\n\nSoyuncu still needs a little refinement, of course. The only game Leicester have lost this season was, ironically, to Manchester United, where Marcus Rashford lured Soyuncu into conceding a penalty. The evidence so far suggests that Rodgers and Evans will help the centre-back to become more accomplished without losing his personality. The Leicester coach Kolo Tour\u00e9 will surely also have good counsel to give on that front.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ricardo Pereira celebrates his goal against Newcastle.

Chilwell, at 22, is an exceptionally mature left-back, assured in defence and constantly dangerous going forward. Pereira, too, has quickly proven to be top class. A year ago, right-back was a problem position for Leicester, and Pereira, a \u00a321m recruit from Porto, did not look like the solution. He was so much at sea during a 4-2 defeat at Bournemouth in September 2018 that one could have concluded that if he were to have a future in the Premier League, it would only be as a wing-back or a midfielder. But the Portuguese soon adapted, demonstrated defensive nous to go with his offensive excellence, and ended up being voted Leicester\u2019s player of the season.\n\nThat vindicated Claude Puel, Rodgers\u2019s predecessor who had worked with Pereira at Nice before bringing him to Leicester. But the style introduced by the former Celtic manager, and the increased fitness he has demanded, are even more suited to Pereira and the rest of Leicester\u2019s young team. The aggressive, co-ordinated pressing \u2013 \u201cdefending forward\u201d, as Rodgers often calls it \u2013 allows the whole team to work in sync and usually on the front foot. That is part what makes them, and Liverpool, so exciting to watch and so formidable to play against.\n\nSaturday\u2019s showdown at Anfield promises to be an all-action contest between two creative and devoutly attacking teams, yet each defence is so strong that there may not be many goals.", "description": "Leicester travel to Liverpool with the joint-best defensive record in the league and Caglar Soyuncu impressing at the back", "authors": ["Paul Doyle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46cf8e940536db26b00a279b933d5300d70a4647/180_40_2133_1280/master/2133.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=643cd3436b6794726141b1aadb9cdb0b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
