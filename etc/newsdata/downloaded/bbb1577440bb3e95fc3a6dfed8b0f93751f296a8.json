The rest of us have allowed the president to serve as our assignment editor. We spread his smears for him, and too often shy from coverage of any threat to democracy more technical than a tweet. At best, we ask Democrats what would, at last, count as an impeachable offense \u2014 but rarely direct such inquiries at Republicans, who, you know, actually stand in the way of a fair impeachment trial.\n\nDemocrats share some blame, too, feckless as they\u2019ve been. They dragged their feet in demanding critical documents, including Trump\u2019s tax returns. They failed to competently question petulant and obstructive witnesses such as former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. And they frequently seem more interested in attacking one another than holding Trump to account.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Rampell", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Whos-To-Blame-For-The-Death-Of-American-Democracy-All-Of-Us"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
