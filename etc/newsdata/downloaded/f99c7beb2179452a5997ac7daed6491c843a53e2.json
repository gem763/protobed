The stockbroking outfit declined to comment on matters before the courts.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring all clients receive an exceptional professional service,\u201d Morgans told The Australian Financial Review.\n\nThe lawsuits are from clients at Morgans\u2019 former Emerald branch from about 2003 until 2016, who allegedly received advice from its branch manager Thomas John Kirby.\n\nThey are claiming to have suffered \u201csubstantial\u201d losses by December 2015, when Mr Kirby finished at Morgans, although the totals are yet to be detailed.\n\nThe claimants range from cattle farming couples to retirees travelling around Australia.\n\nJorg and Maralyn Breitkopf, 75 and 72 respectively, first went to the Emerald branch in February 2003, according to their lawsuit. They claimed they were unhappy with superannuation investments they had with ANZ worth about $374,000.\n\nTheir lawsuit alleges Mr Kirby\u2019s advice included establishing a self-managed superannuation fund, with 50 per cent of their funds to be invested with the share market and the other 50 per cent into \"a fund called EPIC Property Investments\".\n\nMr Kirby allegedly said he was a director of EPIC and travelling to the UK to get further investors, and it hoped to \u201clist on the Australian stock exchange in the future\u201d. The court filings allege Mr Kirby said that his being a director ensured a greater degree of control about what EPIC invested into and to make sure client investments were safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompany searches show Mr Kirby was a director of EPIC Property Investments Ltd until mid-2005, and that the company oversaw property funds, which included industrial real estate. Mr Kirby has also been a director on some funds, company searches show.\n\nThe Breitkopfs\u2019 case said they gave permission for Mr Kirby to invest $250,000 with EPIC, as well as use other money for share trading.\n\nBut by 2005, with Mr Breitkopf needing surgery and wanting to withdraw money, Mr Kirby allegedly said \u201cat this stage EPIC was not going to list on the ASX and that the plaintiffs presently could not withdraw funds from their investment\u201d.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2012, Mr Kirby allegedly recommended the Breitkopfs make one more EPIC-linked investment but also to sell down their holdings at other times.\n\nMr Kirby ceased working with Morgans in December 2015, their claim states.\n\nThe Breitkopfs\u2019 claim, along with the other two lawsuits \u2013 all filed by Holman Webb Lawyers, argue the investment strategy was inappropriate as their risk profiles were \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cbalanced\u201d.\n\nYet EPIC investments, having no secondary market in which to sell, was more attuned to an aggressive or speculative investor, all the lawsuits state.\n\nThe lawsuits claim Morgans breached its fiduciary duty by allowing its interests to come into conflict with client obligations. That included a Morgans compliance reviewer, who checked advisers including Mr Kirby, being an investor with EPIC, the court documents claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorgans also knew or should have known another conflict of interest existed with Mr Kirby having been a director and investor with EPIC, the filings allege.\n\nMr Kirby, also named as a defendant, declined to comment and is yet to file a defence.\n\nEPIC still exists and runs funds, but repeated attempts to obtain comments from directors were unsuccessful.", "description": "Fresh court actions mean five branches in its network have now been subject of litigation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1576%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_69/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e093cf958083e77b476c466f5c203299bd2db524", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
