(AP) - Saquon Barkley returned after missing three games with a sprained right ankle, and it really didn\u2019t do much for the New York Giants\u2019 offense.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals made sure of that Sunday as they limited Barkley to 72 yards rushing and a touchdown in a 27-21 victory Sunday that sent the Giants (2-5) to their third straight loss.\n\nThe return of last year\u2019s NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and tight end Evan Engram was supposed to help the offense and rookie quarterback Daniel Jones.\n\nIt didn\u2019t.\n\nThe offense scored 14 points, with special teams providing the other seven on a blocked punt. The offensive line allowed Jones to be sacked a season-high eight times and the offense generated 263 yards and turned the ball over three times, setting up 17 points for the Cardinals (3-3-1).\n\nWhile Barkley said his ankle felt fine, he only had two rushes of 10 yards or more. Half of his 18 rushes were for either negative yards (three) or between just 1 and 3 yards (six).\n\n\u201cI think as a whole, we have to do better,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the game so anytime you don\u2019t win the game, we have to be better. The object of offense is score more points than the other team does and we didn\u2019t accomplish that today. We have to find a way to do that.\u201d\n\nBarkley, who also caught three passes for 8 yards, could have had a much better day. He had a 32-yard run nullified by a holding penalty against left guard Will Hernandez.\n\nWhether it would have been a 32-yard run without the hold is another question.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was running well,\u201d said Barkley, who left briefly in the third quarter after someone fell on his ankle. \u201cI think I did a little too much on some stuff, but that\u2019s part of my game. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work, most of the time it works, so just have to go watch film and see what I could do better to help my team win.\u201d\n\nJones also has to do a better job of protecting the ball. He threw an interception and lost two fumbles.\n\n\u201cYeah, they did a good job up front,\u201d Jones said of the Cardinals. \u201cThey have some good pass rushers over there, and they did a good job. But I need to do a better job of getting rid of the ball, getting through my reads and getting the ball out. But, yeah, they deserve some credit.\u201d\n\nThe offensive line also has to step up after allowing Jones to take a beating. He was sacked by Chandler Jones four times, and two of the eight sacks led to lost fumbles.\n\n\u201cObviously, we didn\u2019t do our job today, the O-line and whoever else is involved,\u201d guard Kevin Zeitler said. \u201cWe put ourselves in some terrible situations and you can\u2019t do that. You don\u2019t win games like that.\u201d\n\nEven with Barkley back in the lineup.\n\nThe next step is to end the skid at Detroit next weekend.\n\n\u201cWe are in a spot where we have to go back to the drawing board and watch film and get ready for Detroit because that\u2019s our next game,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cTry to get a win and try to get some things going.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saquon Barkley returned after missing three games with a sprained right ankle, and it really didn't do much for the New York Giants' offense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Canavan"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/cardinals_giants_football_80837_c0-75-1791-1119_s1200x700.jpg?af01d9e8f3e11f63f93b4c93a47cf8a8492867af", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
