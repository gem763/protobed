This is where the earliest expeditions, like George Mallory\u2019s in the 1920s, approached from, before China took control of the region in 1951. Under China\u2019s rule, and particularly in the years before the country started to re-engage with the outside world in the 1980s, access from Tibet was largely forgotten by mountaineers and tourists alike.\n\nOver the past five years, this side of the mountain has come into its own. You can get very close to the base camp on this side, with a stunning view of the north face of Everest from the Rongphu Valley. Better still, this route takes in one of the world\u2019s great road trips, Lhasa to Kathmandu, most of it on a world\u2011class asphalt highway completed by the Chinese government in 2016.\n\nHalf as many climbers attempt Everest from the Tibetan side as from the Nepali one in a typical season.\n\nWhen you do it this way, in less than two weeks you can experience the barren wilderness of the Tibetan plains, punctuated by isolated monasteries surprisingly still full of life. The views on this side are considered better than those that people walk weeks to see in Nepal.\n\nA Tibetan pilgrim at Potala Palace in Lhasa. Chris Wright\n\nIt\u2019s a less busy approach, too. Half as many climbers attempt Everest from the Tibetan side as from the Nepali one in a typical season. And, as close to the base camp as you can get, you wouldn\u2019t call it crowded: it takes the best part of a week to drive there, after all. Visiting in September, the peak sunset and sunrise gathering at the closest legal point for tourists to see the mountain numbered about 100 people stretched out across a rocky promontory.\n\nA 2016 National Geographic story compared the two experiences long before the events of May this year. \u201cChina appears to be paving the way, literally and figuratively, to creating a more progressive Everest,\u201d wrote Andrew Bisharat, adding that the Chinese side is more regulated, there are more rangers, and rubbish is removed to keep the area pristine.\n\nSo to experience a less crowded way to see Everest, I signed up for a 13\u2011day overland trip with World Expeditions from Lhasa via the mountain to Nepal.\n\nFirst up on arrival in Lhasa is the all-important job of spending a couple of days acclimatising to the altitude. The Tibetan capital sits at 3600 metres, a fact that reveals itself first as a bad headache, then as an exploded toothpaste tube in my luggage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLhasa has been undeniably changed by China over the years but its landmarks mostly remain intact. Jokhang is the true heart of the city, a cramped and murmuring burrow of a temple in the centre of the surviving old town, but the main building you\u2019ll recognise from postcards is the Potala Palace. It\u2019s truly magnificent both inside and out, even if today it feels more like a museum.\n\nA far more immersive experience in the first part of our tour is visiting the functioning monasteries of Drepung and Sera on the city\u2019s outskirts, where you can still see hundreds of monks neatly ordered on the forecourt: a red mass in their robes, all chanting in bass unison.\n\nBuddhist monks chant in unison at Drepung Monastery on the outskirts of Lhasa. Chris Wright\n\nIn Sera\u2019s \u201cdebating courtyard\u201d, a curious ritual unfolds when one monk stands and puts a theological argument to another monk, who is seated. The standing monk delivers his opinion with a leaping clap, offloading his point of view like a verbal slingshot to the face of his sparring partner.\n\nThe seated monk then responds in peaceful equanimity. Thus they test and validate their beliefs and will power.\n\nSuitably acclimatised, we leave Lhasa early on the third day, already having lost two of the group to altitude sickness. The remaining eight of us board a bus dramatically less striking than its driver, who looks like a Tibetan Errol Flynn in his local booted finery and resplendent moustache.\n\n\"The monk delivers his opinion with a leaping clap\": the debating courtyard of Sera monastery. Chris Wright\n\nEverything about this man, from his eclectic bus soundtrack of Hindi-pop and Tibetan chanting to his joyful dancing \u2013 conducted at mountain vistas and toilet stops \u2013 will enliven the trip.\n\nWe grind through the city\u2019s outer streets, which now look like any other Chinese city, and head south through the hills, past the airport on a fine dual carriageway, and cross the sprawling Brahmaputra River as it drifts its way to India. We follow its banks alongside fields where harvested barley is bunched in tied stacks like Vietnamese hats, waiting for mustard to be planted in its place.\n\nIn time, we near 5000 metres at the first of many passes, the Khamba La. On our winding way up, we pass an occasional well-fed Tibetan mastiff dog sitting on a table at the side of the road. Eventually we stop at a viewpoint where there must be half a dozen of them, some in sunglasses, immaculately groomed alongside a group of uncharacteristically demure yaks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gimmick, of course, is that you can be photographed with these animals for 10 yuan a pop. The usual queasiness about their treatment is softened by the fact that they are the best-cared-for animals I have ever seen in China.\n\nThe writer sitting astride a yak on the road up to Khamba La pass.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not doing that,\u201d I scoff.\n\nAnd then: \u201cHow often do you get the chance to be photographed on a yak?\u201d\n\nOne minute later I\u2019m wearing a Tibetan fur hat and sitting astride a fine white beast, waving a bit of rope around.\n\nI send a photo to my wife who instantly posts it on Facebook, juxtaposed with an image of that kid on the back of the hairy dragon in The Neverending Story. The resemblance can\u2019t be denied.\n\nThis momentary loss of dignity behind me, it\u2019s time to enjoy the first of many panoramic views we\u2019ll have over the next week. The pass overlooks Yamdrok Yumtso, a coiled scorpion of a lake coloured a vivid turquoise and backstopped by a white\u2011tipped mountain. Past the Karola Glacier, the scenery switches back to green hills studded with yellow clumps of rapeseed, as dappled clouds create shifting shadows on the hillsides.\n\nPunctuating the glorious vistas are checkpoints. Tibet is a place of permits within visas, and they all need to be constantly checked.\n\nPunctuating the glorious vistas are checkpoints. Tibet is a place of permits within visas within permits, and they all need to be constantly checked. It\u2019s the only mind-numbing aspect of our trip and makes this an impossible destination to tackle solo. We\u2019re wholly reliant on the impeccable logistical skills of our guides.\n\nWe rumble through the ancient trade town of Gyangtse, dominated by a sturdy hilltop fort that was annexed by British explorer Francis Younghusband in 1904. It\u2019s an act Tibetans recall with some equanimity on the grounds that he didn\u2019t destroy anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext stop is Shigatse, the second largest city in Tibet, where the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery houses a 26-metre statue of Jampa, the Future Buddha, with fingers that stretch a metre long apiece.\n\nWe visit the town of Shegar and watch workers rebuild a once sublime monastery that was destroyed during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution. It makes for a slightly surreal and incongruous scene as the labourers quietly sit at the top of the world, working magic with messy paint pots and brushes, slowly transforming this bricks-and-mortar earthly structure into a vivid, dream-like vision rising from the clouds.\n\nThe hilltop fort overlooking the trade town of Gyangtse. iStockphoto\n\nOn our fourth day out of Lhasa, we finally spy the one road sign we\u2019ve all been waiting for: Qomolangma. This is what Tibetans call Everest and it translates as \u201cGoddess Mother of Mountains\u201d.\n\nExcited tension builds as we climb a hundred switchbacks to the Pang La pass, not knowing whether the clouds will allow us to see the mountain from the top. I wonder what I will feel and say when I see this most famous and mystical of places.\n\nCresting a pass to see the highest peak on earth most definitely takes your breath away \u2013 what\u2019s left of it, anyway.\n\nThe answer turns out to be \u201cAwww, mate,\u201d with the attitude of Adam Gilchrist successfully contesting a pivotal LBW decision. I wish it had been something more poetic, but at the end of the road, that\u2019s how it felt: Mate. Would you look at that.\n\n\"Everest is stocky, broad-shouldered, massive\": the view of the Himalayas from the pass at Pang La is just an appetiser. Chris Wright\n\nCresting a pass to see the highest peak on earth amid the rangy sweep of the Himalaya most definitely takes your breath away \u2013 what\u2019s left of it, anyway.\n\nEverest is stocky, broad-shouldered, massive. Even from 60 kilometres away, as we are here at the pass, and even flanked by giants such as Lhotse, Cho Oyu and Makalu (all of them 8000 metres-plus), it\u2019s still immense \u2013 not just in height, but also width.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a manspreading bully of a mountain, draped stubbornly across the horizon, hogging the sky.\n\nThe view from here is just an appetiser. After a lengthy pitstop, we continue to drive closer for the rest of the day, switching at one point to a fleet of electric buses before reaching Rongbuk Monastery, which sits at 5200 metres in the Rongphu Valley.\n\nYou used to be able to drive further, to the base camp from which George \u201cbecause it\u2019s there\u201d Mallory set off on his fatal attempt to conquer Everest in 1924. But nowadays, the base camp is restricted to those who are actually climbing from the Tibetan side.\n\nEverest, as seen from the final approach road. Chris Wright\n\nNo matter: the view is much the same from here. Or it would be. But we can\u2019t see it.\n\nWe\u2019re sanguine about the cloud, reasoning we\u2019ll see it in the clearer morning, and head to our beds in the one truly rustic accommodation experience on the whole tour. There\u2019s only a single toilet for the whole guesthouse, which is legendary among intrepid travellers for its uniquely abysmal condition (a pretty high \u2013 or low? \u2013 bar to beat in China).\n\nThat night is the first time I am truly hit by altitude sickness. The air has only half the oxygen content it would have at sea level, and soon I\u2019m retching with a skull-crushing headache. Altitude sickness hits everyone in different and undemocratic ways that take no account of age or fitness, but our guide has a portable oxygen tent and is skilled in treatment.\n\nEverest starts to appear in bits: first the right shoulder, and then, as the sun rises, an illuminated side of the summit.\n\nThe night is further enlivened by a weasel of some sort that penetrates the room and attacks the fake Maltesers I bought in Shigatse. The final straw is that I set my alarm for 6am to catch the sunrise, which was stupid. Because Tibet follows Beijing time, as does everywhere in China, it\u2019s never light before 7.30am.\n\nWhen light does arrive, it reveals heavy cloud through the valley and the group\u2019s mood is resigned. Then the wind shifts, and Everest starts to appear in bits: first the right shoulder, and then, as the sun rises, an illuminated side of the summit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eastern flank is revealed \u2013 an icefall at its midriff \u2013 and finally by 8am the whole beast comes into view, smudged briefly by an occasional drifting cloud thousands of metres below the peak.\n\nFrom here, Everest dominates the valley, and is way too big for a zoom lens. You can study the routes that Mallory and others must have taken: the ridges to crest, the starker traverses.\n\nEverest is a goddess, a matriarch. It gives, not takes. Quite simply, it is beautiful.\n\nUp this close, I quickly dismiss my manspreading analogy from the previous day. Everest is a goddess, a matriarch. It gives, not takes. Quite simply, it is beautiful.\n\nOnce everyone has taken the exact same photograph 300 times, we finally pull stumps and retreat, retracing our route towards the main highway. Spoiled by splendour, we don\u2019t even bother to stop as we return over the Pang La pass.\n\nOn a clear day, Rongbuk Monastery in the Rongphu Valley has stunning views of the mighty peak.\n\nIt takes three more days to get to Kathmandu from here, and about three hours to cross the border into Nepal. Borders are odd and illogical up here, passing over the peaks as invisible lines. The mountains and plateau take no account of them; the humans who drew these meaningless marks are of no consequence.\n\nBorders have one very real impact for us, though. Every metre of road on the Chinese side has been pristine. On the Nepali side, it\u2019s a stretch to even call them roads. They have mud of the consistency that trail bikers and Tough Mudder organisers go to considerable effort to create.\n\nWould we have a feeling of greater achievement had we walked for weeks to see the mountain?\n\nThe terrible earthquake of 2015 made a bad situation worse \u2013 ours is not the same border crossing that people used before the earthquake, because the road was destroyed. Even in attempting to navigate the new route we are thwarted: a landslide takes out our road and we eventually make our way to Kathmandu in helicopters, darting above rivers through low monsoon cloud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould we have a feeling of greater achievement had we walked for weeks to see the mountain? Would we feel we\u2019d earned it more had we done it all by foot? Perhaps \u2013 and there\u2019s no argument from me against the famous Nepali treks.\n\nJust know that there\u2019s another way to see Everest, and it looks every inch the prize it is when you get there.\n\nThe writer travelled as a guest of World Expeditions.\n\nAt a glance\n\nGetting there Travellers to the Tibetan side of Everest must be part of an organised group.
