(According to the National Cancer Institute, cancers related to obesity include cancer of the liver, gallbladder, stomach, thyroid, kidneys, ovaries, colon and rectum.)\n\n\"Obesity is an established risk factor for several cancers. In this study, we have focused on the degree, timing and duration of overweight and obesity in relation to cancer risk,\" says Professor Tone Bj\u00f8rge, at the Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen.\n\nWhat the study entailed\n\nThis study used adults with two or more measurements obtained at least three years apart and a possible previous cancer diagnosis. These individuals were followed for an average of 18 years. Obese participants (those with a BMI over 30) were found to have a higher increased risk for cancer.\n\n\"The risk increased by 64% for male participants and 48% for females,\" Bj\u00f8rge says.\n\nIs it too late to live healthier?\n\nAccording to an article on our sister-website Parent24, the obesity problem in South Africa is on the rise, starting at a young age. When unhealthy eating habits are established during childhood, it\u2019s often hard to break the cycle and get rid of the extra weight.\n\nAnd even when there are no immediate threats such as high blood pressure or medical conditions, obesity itself should be considered a disease, said Dr Haitham Ahmed in a previous Health24 article.\n\nBut the sooner you start establishing healthy diet habits and start losing the excess weight, your health may improve. According to John Hopkins Medicine, it\u2019s never too late to make healthy changes, regardless of your age and past.\n\nHere are some tips:\n\nSee a registered dietitian for an appropriate, realistic eating plan for YOUR body and lifestyle. Fad diets will not work in the long term.\n\nOur adult lives are often packed full with family and career responsibilities, but find a form of exercise that you can enjoy, commit to for at least three times a week and fit in even on a busy workday \u2013 these could be anything from walking to at-home workout videos.\n\nQuit smoking if you are still smoking.\n\nFollow a Mediterranean-style diet, which includes lean proteins, whole grains, plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and healthy plant-based fats.\n\nEarly detection of any cancer is key to recovery and successful treatment \u2013 do your at-home checks for breast cancer or prostate cancer, get that dodgy mole checked out and immediately talk to your doctor if you notice a difference in your bowel movements. Also determine your family\u2019s medical history to know what your risks are.\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Weight gain as we get older is quite common \u2013 but you may want to maintain a healthy weight if you're still younger than 40, researchers say.", "authors": ["Compiled Marelize Wilke"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7925/7ee7df7e6d364543abfd19e7a2d74952.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
