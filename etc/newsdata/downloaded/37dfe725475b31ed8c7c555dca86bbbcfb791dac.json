My journey abroad hasn\u2019t succeeded.\u201d\n\nVietHome said it has passed the photographs it has received on to Essex Police to help the process of identifying the dead currently taking place.\n\nIt stated: \u201cWhat VietHome wants to do is help families can find missing people or identify the victims accurately.\u201d\n\nThe website said it had been inundated with calls and messages from anxious relatives in Vietnam seeking news of their loved ones.\n\nA convoy of funeral directors vehicles enter the Port of Tilbury to collect the bodies of the 39 people found inside a lorry in Essex to transport them to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford Credit: Kirsty O'Connor /PA More\n\nThere are growing fears the majority of the 39 who died inside the lorry came from the same poverty stricken rice-growing community as Ms Pham.\n\nFather Anthony Dang Huu Nam, a catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh, a two hour drive from Ms Pham\u2019s home in northern-central Vietnam\u2019s Nghe An province, said he was supporting family members of the victims.\n\n\u201cThe whole district is covered in sorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still collecting contact details for all the victim\u2019s families, and will hold a ceremony to pray for them tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a catastrophe for our community.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke prayers for the dead rang out over loudspeakers throughout the rain-soaked town.\n\nFather Nam said families told him they knew relatives were travelling to the UK but had been unable to contact their loved ones.\n\nSpeaking about Ms Pham\u2019s griefstriken family Father Nam said: \u201cThat girl who said in her message that she couldn\u2019t breathe in the truck? Her parents can\u2019t breathe here at home.\u201d\n\nVietnam\u2019s foreign ministry said it had instructed its London embassy to assist British police with the identification of victims.\n\nNghe An is one of Vietnam\u2019s poorest provinces, and home to many victims of human trafficking who end up in Europe, according to a March report by the Pacific Links Foundation, a U.S.-based anti-trafficking organisation.\n\nDuring the first eight months of this year, 41,790 people left Nghe Anb looking for work, many of them overseas.\n\nThe province was ravaged by one of Vietnam\u2019s worst environmental disasters in 2016 when a steel mill owned by Taiwan\u2019s Formosa Plastics contaminated coastal waters, devastating local fishing and tourism industries and sparking widespread protests.", "description": "The families of as many as 20 Vietnamese migrants fear they were among those who perished in a refrigerator unit found at an industrial estate in Essex.", "authors": ["Patrick Sawer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/p0kt1aOr.6OCFmJkWvCODQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MTgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/34c7fc5062a47384c248fb47f08dcb4b", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
