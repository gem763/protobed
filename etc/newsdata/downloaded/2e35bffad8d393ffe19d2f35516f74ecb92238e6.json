But you knew that.\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s no point pretending that Trump didn\u2019t know what Erdogan intended toward Syria. The two leaders spoke on the phone on Oct. 6, and Trump soon after ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria and, what do you know, Turkey invaded.\n\nAD\n\nThe State Department said Trump doesn\u2019t support the incursion, which may or may not be true. In any case, saying you don\u2019t support it doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t deliberately create circumstances that made such an incursion possible.\n\nHow credulous must one be to accept that these events were coincidental?\n\nBut Trump is a wheeler-dealer. He wouldn\u2019t cut such a deal without something in return. He already has two towers in Istanbul, so that\u2019s probably not on his to-do list. What does Erdogan have that Trump wants?\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess at this point. But Trump has blood on his hands, which means America has blood on hers. Whatever motivated our moody president, the consequences were obvious. The immediate effects are well-known, but the longer-term ripple effects could plague the region, not to mention the United States\u2019 standing in the world, for years to come.\n\nAD\n\nThanks to Trump and Erdogan, it is now more likely the Islamic State will begin reorganizing. The U.S. pullout also strengthens the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, by extension, Russia and Iran.\n\nNaturally, the willfully ignorant and impulsive Trump issued his order to withdraw troops despite repeated warnings from his military and foreign policy advisers. It seems plain enough that he didn\u2019t heed their advice because he didn\u2019t want to hear it.\n\nAD\n\nBottom line: Trump appears to have wanted to please Erdogan. The sanctions and tariff hike may be merely part of the setup. Thus, while tensions rise in the Middle East \u2014 and the United States\u2019 foes jockey for position to benefit from the aftermath \u2014 Trump has created cause for plausible deniability. Hey, I thought it was the right thing to do. We can\u2019t be involved in endless wars.\n\nAD\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned over the past three years, Trump does what Trump wants. He\u2019s the CEO of America, after all. Then, once he unleashes havoc, he delegates to others the burden of his consequences: \u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nFor starters, on Sunday, around 785 people connected to the Islamic State escaped from a detention camp.\n\nAD\n\nThe impetus behind all this chaos and carnage apparently was Erdogan\u2019s wish to rid himself of some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees languishing in Turkey. He and Trump surely could find common cause in that sentiment. Under Erdogan\u2019s plan, Turkey would resettle and oversee about 1 million refugees along the newly confiscated border area. From his perspective, the Kurds living there are terrorists, though they fought alongside U.S. and European troops against the Islamic State. Thus, Erdogan is solving two problems, thanks, it seems, to Trump\u2019s generous acquiescence.\n\nAD\n\nFrom Trump\u2019s point of view, what\u2019s the big deal? U.S. troops leave the badlands and let the others fight among themselves. The bigger picture reveals that the president has further alienated our allies, made the United States less trustworthy, surrendered U.S. leverage in the area, and enabled what is essentially a campaign of ethnic cleansing.\n\nTrump, apparently, feels empowered while directing geopolitics by the seat of his pants, feeding his rapacious ego with the admiration of totalitarians such as Kim Jong Un of North Korea, Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and the Saudi royals. But, Erdogan, what\u2019s he got?\n\nAD\n\nOne shudders to think: Either Trump is wagging the dog to create a distraction. Or, not to state the obvious, he isn\u2019t the \u201cextremely stable genius\u201d he claims to be.\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump wouldn\u2019t have cut such a deal in Syria without expecting something in return.", "authors": ["Kathleen Parker", "Columnist Covering Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1MZVkrYdvI_pOlClXB_eHrU7lLk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BLYNHBXPQQI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
