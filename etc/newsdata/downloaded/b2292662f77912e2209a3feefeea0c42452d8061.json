(Photo: NEIL HALL, EPA-EFE)\n\nKeira Knightley is in the newborn fog right now.\n\nThe actress, who never officially announced her pregnancy, was spotted earlier in the year rocking a growing baby bump.\n\nBut, it seems that baby No. 2 has arrived, and she talked about it during an interview with Louise Minchin on BBC Breakfast posted to bbc.com Friday.\n\nThe \"Pride and Prejudice\" star was on to talk politics and her role in a new film \"Official Secrets\" when she finally admitted she was a little exhausted with a newborn at home.\n\n\"I can't remember what your question was. You can tell I have a 6-week-old baby, haven't you? I'm talking but I have no idea where I'm going,\" Knightley says.\n\nBritish journalist Minchin congratulates her before taking the opportunity to talk motherhood.\n\nWhile Knightley is very private about her kids and isn't on social media, she is refreshingly honest when it comes to being a mom, which is evident in the interview.\n\n\"Can I just say this is about the third time since I've given birth that my hair has been brushed?\" she jokes. \"And I didn't brush it,\" she adds, explaining that her hairdresser did all the work alongside a team of people that got her out of her pajamas and \"led\" her there.\n\nShe tells Minchin that she has six hours to work with breaks for pumping breast milk before she has to get back home for a feeding.\n\n\"There is a bit of extra milk, which I'd love not to use because it's in the freezer and you know that can be tricky, but it is there,\" she says.\n\nMichin comments that people don't imagine that Hollywood stars have to deal with the stuff normal people do.\n\n\"What, pumping?\" Knightley responds. \"You definitely have to deal with pumping. Everyone has to deal with pumping, if you're doing that and if it's working and if you want to do that and you can do that, then yes we're pumping. Pumping. So much pumping.\"\n\nBut Knightley's advice for \"normal\" moms without makeup artists and stylists?\n\n\"Then you should still be in your pajamas and don't brush your hair and let the house be a complete mess and only see people who are going to bring you food,\" she says.\n\nYAAASSS mama!\n\nKnightley also shares daughter Edie, 4, with her husband James Righton. Edie is apparently a huge fan of \"Paw Patrol,\" which Knightley once called \"toddler crack.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/11/keira-knightley-talks-going-back-work-pumping-after-baby/3942665002/", "description": "The \"Pride and Prejudice\" star Keira Knightley never announced her pregnancy, but did talk about new mom life on BBC Breakfast.", "authors": ["Amy Haneline", "Published P.M.
