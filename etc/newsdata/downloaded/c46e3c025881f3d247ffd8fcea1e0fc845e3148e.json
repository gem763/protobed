She didn't turn to look in the direction of the public gallery, where people pointed their fingers at her and whispered.\n\nContempt\n\nRaath reprimanded the people in the gallery, warning them that they should remain silent and threatened to detain them for contempt of court.\n\n\"This is a courtroom. There is plenty space downstairs and if you continue making a noise, you will all go down [to the holding cells],\" Raath said.\n\nThe accused's legal representative, Athi Linigane, withdrew without giving reasons and a new lawyer is taking over.\n\nThe case was postponed to May 31 so that the State can obtain video footage and witness statements.\n\nMembers of the public order police unit arrived in two vans and managed to sneak the woman out of the court building.\n\nThis angered the crowd, who charged at the police vehicles, banging, screaming and hurling insults at the woman.\n\n\"I want to show her who I am. She can't beat up my niece and think that I will leave her alone. I want to beat her up in vengeance of what she did. In me, she has met up with her match. We are both adults and parents and must fix this woman-to-woman. I want to [take] revenge for my niece. Police must not interfere with us because they were not there when she was having fun with our children.\n\n\"She is out on bail and doesn't deserve to be escorted by police. She came here happy and laughing with her family thinking she is untouchable\u2026I didn't go to work because I wanted to physically deal with her,\" said one of the protesters.\n\nPolice spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, said there are instances when an accused who is out on bail is allowed to be escorted by police.\n\n\"This can only be done if there is a threat or any danger to the accused, based on assessment that would be done by officers,\" Peters said.\n\nOperating on an expired licence\n\nGauteng Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza closed the cr\u00e8che, after the videos of the alleged abuse went viral, saying the institution in question had been operating on an expired licence.\n\n\"This is an illegal entity in operation. When I asked for the cr\u00e8che's certificate, I looked at it and it is a 2016 certificate. The principal should have complied and applied for a new certificate, but she did not do that,\" she said.\n\nIn one of the videos, a young girl is forced to clean up after she vomited. The child is slapped on her buttocks. In another video, a toddler is slapped for what appears to be a refusal to sleep, News24 earlier reported.\n\nALSO READ: UPDATE: Carletonville 'horror' cr\u00e8che shut down, licence expired 3 years ago\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Police have escorted a caregiver from the Oberholzer Magistrate's Court, where an angry mob of protesters have been waiting for her after her appearance in connection with child abuse allegations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8708/49c60e32fcf64d52aa66d39215399147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-07"}
