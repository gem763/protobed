But his narrow victory did not erase questions about whether President Donald Trump and his party\u2019s congressional candidates face troubling headwinds approaching 2020.\n\nBishop, 55, a state senator best known for a North Carolina law dictating which public bathrooms transgender people can use, defeated centrist Democrat Dan McCready. Bishop was the beneficiary of an election-eve rally in the district headlined by Trump, who told the crowd a victory would be \u201cthe first steps to firing Speaker Nancy Pelosi and winning back the House in 2020.\u201d\n\nMcCready, 36, a former Marine turned financier of solar energy projects, was banking on the district\u2019s suburban moderates to carry him over the top. He was already a familiar name in the district: He narrowly trailed in an election for the seat last November that was later invalidated after evidence surfaced of vote tampering.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election had been seen as too close to call, in itself an ominous sign for Republicans. Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in 2016, and a loss would have been a worrisome preface to the party\u2019s campaigns next year. Republicans have held the seat since 1963.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Even so, a McCready victory, or even a narrow defeat, would have signaled that the Democrats\u2019 2018 string of victories in suburban districts in red states including Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas could persist.\n\nThere is almost no pathway to Republicans regaining House control next year unless they avoid losing more suburban districts and win back some they lost last year.\n\nThe district stretches from Charlotte, one of the nation\u2019s financial nerve centers, through its flourishing eastern suburbs and into less prosperous rural counties along the South Carolina line. More than half its voters were expected to come from the suburbs.\n\nSince Trump became president, voters in such communities \u2014 particularly women and college-educated voters \u2014 have abandoned Trump in droves over his conservative social policies and vitriolic rhetoric on immigration and race.\n\nAlong with a GOP victory in a second vacant House district in North Carolina, Republicans pared the Democratic majority in the House to 235-199, plus one independent. That means to win control of the chamber in 2020, Republicans will need to gain 19 seats, which a slew of GOP retirements, anti-Trump sentiment among moderate voters and demographic changes suggest will be difficult.\n\nSuburban defections would also jeopardize the reelection prospects of Trump, who\u2019s already facing slipping poll numbers. Limiting the erosion of those voters will be crucial for him to retain swing states like North Carolina, which he won by less than 4 percentage points in 2016.\n\n\u201cI am a registered Republican, but I am fed up with the agenda of the Republican Party,\u201d said Bob Southern, 75, of Mint Hill, a Charlotte suburb. \u201cI am so disappointed in this president, and he frightens me very much.\u201d\n\nSouthern said he voted for McCready.\n\nBishop was counting on the district\u2019s Republican-leaning tendencies.\n\n\u201cBishop, his policies follow my convictions \u2014 after hearing Bishop, knowing that he\u2019s for the Second Amendment and he\u2019s against illegal immigration,\u201d said Susie Sisk, 73, another retiree from Mint Hill. The registered Democrat said she voted for Bishop.\n\nA McCready win would also have let Democrats brag that they controlled a congressional district that covers a piece of Charlotte, where next summer\u2019s Republican National Convention will be held to renominate Trump.\n\nUnderscoring the GOP\u2019s all-out effort to avoid a demoralizing defeat, Vice President Mike Pence also campaigned in the district on Monday. And while McCready outspent Bishop by nearly $3 million, top outside GOP groups poured in $6.4 million, outpacing Democrats\u2019 $2.9 million and nearly evening out the expenditures.\n\nIn another special election, Republican Greg Murphy, a doctor and state legislator, as expected defeated Democrat Allen Thomas to keep a House district along North Carolina\u2019s Atlantic coast.\n\nThat seat has been vacant since February, when 13-term GOP Rep. Walter Jones died, and Trump won it handily in 2016.\n\nThe bathroom law that Bishop sponsored was repealed after it prompted a national outcry and boycotts that The Associated Press estimated cost North Carolina $3.7 billion.\n\nBishop bound himself tightly to Trump, backing his proposed border wall with Mexico and accusing Trump critics of being intent on \u201cdestroying him.\u201d In a TV spot airing Election Day, he said his opponent is \u201cbacked by radicals\u201d as the screen flashed the faces of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders and outspoken liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nMcCready used his creation of a company that\u2019s financed solar energy projects to cast himself as a job creator and environmental champion. He also focused on containing health care costs and ran a spot featuring his trademark promise to prioritize \u201ccountry over party.\u201d\n\nThe district received a black eye this year when state officials voided its 2018 election, which McCready lost by 900 votes to then-GOP candidate Mark Harris. That decision followed allegations of ballot tampering by a Republican political consultant, and Harris opted to not run again.\n\nAnother jolt of notoriety occurred in July when Trump staged a rally for Bishop in nearby Greenville. Trump said four Democratic women of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, though all but one was born in the U.S. The crowd began chanting \u201cSend her back.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Conservative Republican Dan Bishop won a special election in North Carolina, averting a Democratic capture of a GOP-leaning district", "authors": ["Alan Fram"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/dan_bishop_north_carolina_special_election.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C53px%2C3393px%2C1776px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
