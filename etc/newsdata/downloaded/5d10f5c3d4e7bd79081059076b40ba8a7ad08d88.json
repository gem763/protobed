In 2019, his stories seem to be everywhere. On Halloween comes Doctor Sleep, the sequel to The Shining. It is the fourth King-derived movie this year, following Pet Sematary, In the Tall Grass (Netflix\u2019s third King adaptation in three years) and, still on release, It: Chapter Two. Meanwhile, coming to the small screen we have HBO\u2019s The Outsider, Amazon\u2019s The Dark Tower, a Julianne Moore-led Lisey\u2019s Story, The Stand, season three of Mr Mercedes and season two of Castle Rock. His 61st novel, The Institute, was also released last month. A TV adaptation is already in the works.\n\nYou do not have to look far for explanations for King\u2019s ubiquity. For one thing, It: Chapters One and Two are two of the highest-grossing horror movies ever. For another, King movies have an illustrious pedigree: Carrie, The Shining, The Shawshank Redemption, Misery, The Dead Zone, etc. In a content-hungry but risk-averse age, he is a recognisable seal of quality. And where so many current titles are built on elaborate mythologies, political allegory or genre-savvy trickery, King is a master at inserting supernatural elements into familiar settings: a hotel, a car, high school, suburbia. He makes horror for people who wouldn\u2019t say they liked horror.\n\nKing has also used his brand identity for good, though, via his \u201cdollar babies\u201d. In 1977, he decided to let aspiring film-makers option any of his short stories for one dollar, on the condition they didn\u2019t exhibit them commercially. As a result, many King stories have been filmed several times over; there are at least 18 different versions of Mute, for example. One dollar-baby beneficiary was Frank Darabont, whose adaptation of The Woman in the Room paved the way for The Shawshank Redemption.\n\nNot everything King touches turns to gold. Darabont\u2019s Shawshank follow-up The Green Mile was textbook \u201cmagical negro\u201d shmaltz. And the 2017 film version of The Dark Tower, led by Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, bombed. The Shining can hardly count as a King triumph, given Stanley Kubrick added his own elements (the twins, the blood elevator, the maze, \u201cHere\u2019s Johnny\u201d). Doctor Sleep is based on King\u2019s 2013 sequel, catching up with tricycling Danny Torrance as a grownup (Ewan McGregor), but for continuity\u2019s sake, the movie has to incorporate \u201cthe cinematic universe\u201d of Kubrick\u2019s Shining.\n\nThe difference between the two Shinings is illuminating: Kubrick reshaped it as a psychological horror, more interested in the demons within; King\u2019s stories, by contrast, avoid ambiguity. Rather, King\u2019s tales often reassure us that the horror is not within ourselves. For some reason, we can\u2019t get enough of hearing that.", "description": "The horror overlord is everywhere in 2019, and with good reason.
