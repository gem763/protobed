Using cardboard, make an oval template to trace, about 2 inches long by 1 \u00bd-inches wide. Trace 48 ovals onto 3 pieces of parchment paper cut to rimmed baking sheets. Flip parchment over, line baking sheets with parchment and set aside.\n\nSift together the almond flour, icing sugar and cocoa in a large bowl. Whisk in the vanilla sugar.\n\nBeat together the egg whites and egg white powder with a hand mixer until foamy. Gradually add the granulated sugar. Beat until the mixture is thick and glossy. Gently fold in the almond mixture. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip.\n\nPipe onto prepared template-lined trays. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, rotating pans halfway through cooking time. Cool completely.\n\nChocolate French Buttercream:\n\nPlace the sugar and water into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and boil until a candy thermometer reads 240 to 245F degrees, brushing the sides of the pan with a damp pastry brush if sugar appears on sides of pan to prevent crystallization.\n\nMeanwhile whisk the egg yolks in a large, heat-proof bowl. While whisking vigorously, pour in hot sugar syrup.\n\nBeat with a hand mixer on high speed until room temperature, about 3 minutes. Add butter in 3 additions, mixing well after each addition.\n\nMelt the chocolate in a heat proof bowl set over a small saucepan of gently simmering water. Remove from heat and stir in the sour cream, vanilla and chocolate extract. Add the buttercream and stir together.\n\nTransfer to a piping bag fitted with medium round tip.\n\nPraline:\n\nPlace the sugar, water and vanilla bean seeds into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and boil until a candy thermometer reads 345F degrees, brushing sides of the pan with a damp pastry brush if sugar appears on sides of pan to prevent crystallization.\n\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nTo the hot sugar, immediately stir in the hazelnuts and cocoa butter and pour mixture out onto prepared baking sheet in a thin layer to cool. Once cooled, remove from parchment and break into pieces. Place into the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the nuts are finely chopped. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet.\n\nAssembly:\n\nLine up cookies in pairs. Flip over half and pipe buttercream onto each to within a \u00bc-inch of edge. Top with second cookie and press together lightly to form a sandwich. Chill in the fridge while tempering the chocolate\n\nTemper chocolate:\n\nHeat \u00be of chocolate in a bain-marie to 50C degrees, stirring often. Remove from heat and add reserved chocolate. Continue stirring until temperature reaches 27C degrees. Return briefly to bain-marie and heat gently to 31 to 32C degrees.\n\nDip \u2154 of each sandwich cookie into tempered chocolate. Dip chocolate covered part into praline and place onto serving plate to set.\n\nYield: Makes 24 sandwich cookies", "description": "Chris' hazelnut-topped treat helped him win the title of Star Baker on Chocolate Week.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5323612.1571331168!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/chocolate-sandwich-cookies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
