This however will not affect the airline's schedule as maintenance had already been planned for before the grounding.\n\nComair's schedule returned to normal on Thursday - 12 of their planes were affected.\n\n\"SAA once again apologises for the inconvenience caused during the past two days and will continue to update customers on an ongoing basis when required,\" says the airline in a statement.\n\n\"SAA wishes to assure all customers that despite the compliance verification process on a specified number of aircraft by the maintenance subsidiary, SAAT, all of the airline\u2019s aircraft are airworthy and normal operations have been restored.\"\n\nREAD: 'Woke up at 4am, just to get slapped with a 5-hour flight delay' - Twitter reacts to devastating flight delays\n\nOn Thursday at a press conference, SACAA revealed that there were five key findings regarding serious inadequacies at SAAT that contributed to the self-grounding of the airlines, two of which were deemed very serious.\n\nOne was related to an issue where aircraft were released from maintenance by unqualified staff at SAAT, while the other was related to maintenance on black boxes and their voice recorders that weren't done in line with international regulations.\n\n\"We are in the business of safety and security, and that involves passengers' lives and cannot be taken likely. The CAA doesn\u2019t have any friends that they negotiate with, we don\u2019t discuss if there\u2019s an imminent danger \u2013 we act. We are firm, we are fair and we act without fear or favour,\" said SACAA head Poppy Khoza at the briefing.\n\n*Compiled by Gabi Zietsman\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
