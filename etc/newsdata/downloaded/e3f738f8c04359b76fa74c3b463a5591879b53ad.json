Joe Biden's final answer interrupted during debate", "language": "en", "text": "Some protesters cut off former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden during the latter's final answer of Thursday's debate at Texas Southern University.\n\nUnfortunately for them, it appears they were mostly inaudible on ABC's broadcast of the debate.\n\nThe protesters interrupted Biden's final answer with shouting that went mostly unheard by those watching on television, according to Twitter. Many on the social media website said they couldn't understand what the protesters were saying -- what the protesters shouted wasn't 100 percent synchronized.\n\nOne debate attendee said she understood what the protesters were saying: \"We are DACA recipients. Our lives are at risk.\" Photos from the event that show the protesters being escorted out show some were wearing shirts that said, \"Defend DACA. Abolish ICE. Citizenship for all.\"\n\nThe protestors were yelling, \u201cwe are DACA recipients. Our lives are at risk.\u201d Unclear if they were TSU students. #DemDebate #DemocratDebate \u2014 Jess Davidson (@DavidsonJess22) September 13, 2019\n\nBiden was attempting to answer the final question of the debate regarding the quality of resilience. The multi-part question was, \"What is the most significant professional setback you had to face, how did you recover from it and what did you learn from it?\"\n\nMore debate coverage: Andrew Yang on healthcare during the Democratic Debate: 'I'm Asian, so I know a lot of doctors'\n\nBiden and Castro debate health care: 'Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?'\n\nProtesters are escorted out of the auditorium by security during the Democratic Presidential Debate at Texas Southern University's Health and PE Center on Sept. 12, 2019 in Houston, Texas. More\n\n\"I never counted any professional setback I had as a serious setback,\" Biden, who was the first candidate to respond, said. \"There are things that are important, things that are unimportant.\"\n\nThat's as far as Biden got before the protesters starting screaming. He attempted to continue his answer, but was delayed nearly 50 seconds before he could continue. His time to speak was restarted due to the interruption.\n\nFor the most part, Twitter was filled with people who were looking for answers.\n\nI agree with those protestors--\"Murhhjhdhgflmflffm!\" \u2014 Mark Harris (@MarkHarrisNYC) September 13, 2019\n\nIt's been almost 45 seconds and Twitter hasn't yet told me what the protestors were protesting, what is even the point of this site #DemDebate \u2014 Josh Lesser (@beentoprague) September 13, 2019\n\nHello twitter I\u2019m here to see what the protestors are saying \u2014 Johana FAIR CONTRACT NOW Bhuiyan (@JMBooyah) September 13, 2019\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: What were they saying?
