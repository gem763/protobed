Smith-Cameron Knows Why You Love Gerri", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s not just the smirks. Photo: HBO\n\nJ. Smith-Cameron is enjoying a career high playing Waystar Royco corporate attorney Gerri Killman \u2014 what a last name! \u2014 on Jesse Armstrong\u2019s Succession, the HBO comedy-drama that answers the question, \u201cWhat if Arrested Development and King Lear had a baby?\u201d But she\u2019s been a memorable player in TV series and films ever since her screen debut in the 1979 indie film Gal Young Un \u2014 and even more so, an acclaimed stage actress Off Broadway and on. She became a star in regional theater scenes when she was still technically a college student (she got wrapped up in professional stage work and never graduated), landed her first Broadway role immediately after moving to New York City, and has appeared in notable theatrical productions ever since, both independent of and in collaboration with her husband, the playwright and filmmaker Kenneth Lonergan.\n\nVulture spoke with Smith-Cameron a few weeks ago about on Gerri\u2019s delightfully fraught relationship with Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin), the youngest son of the Rupert Murdoch\u2013like media baron Logan Roy (Brian Cox). But she is such a delightful interview, and she represents such a rich history of theater, film, and television with an independent spirit, that a longer follow-up was in order. We met with her recently for lunch at a restaurant in Soho, where she lives with Lonergan and their college-bound daughter, Nellie, for a conversation about her long and varied career, her work on the Sundance TV cult classic Rectify, her origins in and allegiance to theater, and the balance of art and life.\n\nYou had both feet in theater for a lot of your career, with occasional film and TV work, but now it\u2019s heavily weighted toward screen acting. Can you walk us through the trip from there to here?\n\nI went to high school in Greenville, South Carolina. The teacher I had got his M.F.A. from Florida State, and I was nagged into going there because he was fabulous and I was impressionable. I did Victor Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s first movie as a director, Gal Young Un, when I was still a student there. I stopped for a while to work with a children\u2019s theater company, Actors Theater of Louisville, and I kept thinking I was going back, then I auditioned for a theater in Miami and they hired me for a whole season. I got my [Actors] Equity card. I was still supposed to be a student, so it was all a little blurry. A lot of actors go to New York and Los Angeles, but it wasn\u2019t clear where I was supposed to go from where I was.\n\nWhat did you get out of the experience of being a regional actor?\n\nI got to play all these great leading roles! At that time, the regional theater movement was just beginning to be a big deal. People had these really groovy careers where they got to be in all of these great plays, and it didn\u2019t matter that they lived in Minneapolis or Atlanta. That sounded sublime! But I didn\u2019t know anybody in the field. For the most part, you had to be in the right place at the right time, be related to somebody, be fabulous-looking, or just have some kind of huge break. Those sorts of parts came wonderfully into my path during the years when I was supposed to be in college.\n\nWhat lessons did you take from that phase of your life?\n\nThe big thing is that you don\u2019t really need a degree, per se. You need the knowledge you acquired from college. Nobody\u2019s ever asked me for my degree. Not once. A college education is worth it for the knowledge you acquire there and the contacts you make.\n\nSo, as a parent, you\u2019re in the camp of, \u201cGo to college to fill your brain up, and don\u2019t get too hung up on your career.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, yeah. I look at my daughter, Nellie, who is a high-school senior and applying in college this semester, and I am jealous of people who got to do the liberal-arts thing.\n\nSuccession is a peak in visibility for you. You\u2019re one of those overnight successes that was decades in the making.\n\nIt\u2019s so exciting being in it and being able to play so many scenes with Kieran.\n\nAn actor who, in addition to his other fine qualities, seems incapable of sitting on a chair or couch like a normal person.\n\n[Laughs.] I love that about him!\n\nHow did you two develop a rapport?\n\nYou know, I was in a play with him, The Starry Messenger, with Matthew Broderick and Catalina Sandino Moreno from Maria Full of Grace. I already knew Kieran because he had done Kenny\u2019s play This Is Our Youth years and years earlier in the West End \u2014 and then he did it again with Michael Cera on Broadway, but with Kieran playing the other part. He was in Kenny\u2019s movie Margaret, too. So there\u2019s a real connection between the two of us.\n\nKieran Culkin and J. Smith-Cameron on Succession. Photo: HBO\n\nWhat do you like best about playing a major role on a popular TV show?\n\nI felt like Gerri was a question mark when I originally auditioned. She was just supposed to be a recurring part. That was fine, but I couldn\u2019t feel who she was as a person yet. Now, I feel like I had a hand in creating her along with the writers.\n\nYou took an active hand in that process?\n\nI tried to, yes. It became a mission of mine last year. When the show got picked up for season one, they had to flesh out the other Waystar Royco employees. I was supposed to be in the second through sixth episodes [of season one] and maybe come back again at the very end, but I ended up getting written into every episode. I got very chuffed about that.\n\nAnd then they came up with a great story line in season two with her and Roman and their relationship. There\u2019s a sexual component, but they\u2019re also confidants, plus there\u2019s a maternal aspect. There\u2019s a lot going on there!\n\nLate in season two, Logan says he doesn\u2019t need psychotherapy because he already knows he doesn\u2019t want to fuck his mother. Then the camera cuts to Roman with a very complicated, uncomfortable reaction on his face. It\u2019s a payoff for all your scenes with him up till then.\n\nI love all of that! But I must say, given the, uh, sorts of people you see on this show, it\u2019s fascinating how certain characters become fan favorites \u2014 if indeed Gerri is a fan favorite, as I\u2019ve been told that she is. I\u2019m just so tickled by that!\n\nIt\u2019s just so different, this kind of attention. Janet on Rectify was a very important role, a substantial role. It was more central to the story than Gerri. But Succession is just a different kind of thing.\n\nWhat was it like doing Rectify?\n\nI loved playing Janet. From the very start, I got to play somebody who\u2019s emotionally shut down, but also, right on the edge of the dam bursting. I knew a few women like that growing up in the South. One was my own mother, who has since passed away. She was not shut down, exactly \u2014 she was very ladylike and demure, very loving and grateful \u2014 but there was always a sadness about her. She hadn\u2019t really had a chance to live her life because her life had a lot of struggle in it. Those were things that I tried to channel as I was playing Janet, the way she moved, the way she held her shoulders.\n\nYou were playing your mom?\n\nYeah, a little bit. Some of it just was my mom. Some of it was Rosalynn Carter! But the funny thing is, when you\u2019re on a TV show, you don\u2019t really know who you\u2019re playing. At the beginning, you don\u2019t have all the facts about your character because they don\u2019t have all the facts about your character. On Succession next season, they could tell me, \u201cGerri ran away to join the circus when she was 18,\u201d and I\u2019d have to be like, \u201cOkay! Let me figure out how to make this work.\u201d\n\nDoes it bother you that there\u2019s so much about a TV character that\u2019s unknown?\n\nYeah, but only in the sense that I came up in the theater, where you have four or so weeks to mull over and rehearse the new beats and talk about it. If it\u2019s a new play, there might be very long periods of fantastic conversations, and then you go and do it one way in front of an audience, and then you go, \u201cOh, this fellow\u2019s not getting his laugh. Maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s picking up the cat right then and the audience is looking there.\u201d Once you\u2019ve got it all down, you absorb everything as if by osmosis, and then it\u2019s like you\u2019re performing chamber music.\n\nThe composition is finished, but once you\u2019ve locked it, that\u2019s the play.\n\nYeah, the play is the play. If you know that a story line is going to end with a character accused of a crime being found guilty, you can shape your performance one way or another using that knowledge.\n\nSpeaking of that: On Rectify, did it bother you that for a long time, you didn\u2019t know if your character\u2019s son was guilty or not?\n\nI happened to really like that. During that long time Daniel was in jail, after which he had confessed and been convicted, I think Janet had struggled with the same things Daniel struggled with, namely that he doesn\u2019t know whether he did it because he was really drunk and really high. Amantha had him on a pedestal, but with Janet it was more like, \u201cI will love you no matter what you did, but if you know the truth someday, I hope you will share it with me.\u201d\n\nJ. Smith-Cameron and Aden Young in Rectify. Photo: SundanceTV\n\nI feel like Rectify, despite its subject matter, is the kind of show that inspires hope, whereas on Succession there\u2019s no hope. Most of the characters are corrupt to the core. That\u2019s the point.\n\nHope isn\u2019t even a concept! People keep asking me, \u201cDo you think all these [Succession characters] are bad people? Are you playing a bad person?\u201d I don\u2019t know what to say to that. The entire world view of the show is that these are hard, mercenary people. The rules of their universe are dog-eat-dog.\n\nHow does it affect you living in that world for months on end?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t affect me as much as you might imagine. I\u2019ll tell you why: Gerri is not as far gone morally or psychologically as some of the other major characters. She still has the ability to be shocked, even though she compartmentalizes that because she has to do her job. She\u2019s horrified by certain things that the Roys demand that she do or say, but it behooves her not to object, so she rolls her eyes a lot \u2014 not commenting aloud, but commenting to the audience.\n\nI get the impression that Gerri struggles with what is asked of her, even though it\u2019s not for very long.\n\nAbsolutely. She\u2019s a lawyer! Her job is to figure out, \u201cWhat can we get away with?\u201d Although, when a corporate lawyer is the character who seems to have the most conscience, what does that tell you? [Laughs.]\n\nJ. Smith-Cameron and Kenneth Lonergan. Photo: Bruce Glikas/WireImage\n\nHow did you meet your spouse and frequent collaborator, Kenneth Lonergan?\n\nMy friend the actor Patrick Breen had written a little short play. It was part of an evening of short plays. During the tech rehearsal, we got to see everybody else\u2019s plays. One of them was a one-scene version of what would later become You Can Count on Me. The third play had an actor in it who was really sweet and funny \u2014 and it turned out to be Kenny. When I found out that same cute, funny actor had written that other play \u2026 well, I was interested.\n\nWhen you\u2019re acting in something that your husband is writing and/or directing, do you ever feel the temptation to play the spouse card and get inside information?\n\nThat tends to backfire on me. If I have a question about a scene, it\u2019s definitely tempting to come up to him at home and ask him about it.\n\nBut you don\u2019t?\n\nNo! Kenny felt like he couldn\u2019t get distance between work and home that way, so I have to schedule time with him like anybody else. But I understand that. I understand how it can be uncomfortable to not have a zone of safety around work. And also, the need to prevent work from impacting the intimacy that you have with your family.\n\nI haven\u2019t been in many plays since I became a mother. Since I had Nellie, I would do maybe one play a year. That\u2019s why I started to become more interested in [screen acting].\n\nI hear that a lot from actors with kids. If you have a partner to pick up the slack, the production time on movies and shows is a little more manageable, even if it\u2019s out of town or out of state. It\u2019s not as open-ended, like a play that might run forever. And you\u2019re not frustrated being in the same city with your kids yet your evenings are spoken for.\n\nRectify was manageable. It was shot just outside of Atlanta, but it was just close enough that I could fly back and forth, and Nellie and Kenny could go down and visit. I got to do plays during the off-season. When I did Juno and the Peacock, which was one of my favorite jobs I\u2019ve ever had, Nellie was able to stay up late at night and come to the dressing room and do her homework there and listen to the show on the speakers while it was happening downstairs.\n\nDid the scheduling ever get tricky?\n\nOh, sure. My mother passed away within the last year and a half. She lived in Virginia, where my siblings live. I was going back and forth a lot while also working on Rectify. And then Kenny was shooting Manchester by the Sea at the same time that I was shooting a season of Rectify. We had to have a family friend take care of Nellie. It isn\u2019t always easy.\n\nDo you ever worry that your parenting got in the way of your career, or that your career got in the way of your parenting? I worry about that.\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes been difficult, but in the big picture, it\u2019s good that I continued to work. I\u2019m a professional who\u2019s also the mother of a daughter. I feel like if you\u2019re the mother of a girl or girls, part of the job is modeling a working person for your daughter, even if your job is something like acting. It doesn\u2019t even have to be a career per se. It could be something you regard as your career even if you\u2019re not compensated for it, but it\u2019s something you love and feel passionate about.\n\nDo you ever wish you\u2019d focused on screen acting sooner?\n\nSome people want to do more film and TV, some people don\u2019t. Some people want to go out to L.A. for pilot season. I was generally happier being back here. Occasionally I would get cast in a TV movie. I was in a wonderful show called The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd, which was shot right at one of the studios in Queens. I played John Pankow\u2019s wife. Every episode was written by a New York playwright. Albert Innaurato wrote one of the scripts. The cast was incredible \u2014 John Glover and Victor Garber and all these other really cool people.\n\nBut mostly, I was about the stage. I didn\u2019t do a lot of TV and film acting earlier because I was busy building a body of work in theater, playing really good parts. I got to play Shakespeare. I got to be in new plays. I meet people nowadays, and they assume I was not successful until Rectify or Succession. But honestly I never felt that way. From the time I was in my early 20s, I was always doing substantial parts and working with substantial people. I\u2019m proud of my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.", "description": "J.
