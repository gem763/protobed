I am old enough to remember these warnings against snacks and recall feeling puzzled by the logic. Why was it OK to eat a slice of toast as part of breakfast but not OK to eat the exact same toast during a peckish hour in the afternoon?\n\nAlmost no one lives by the \u201cno snacking\u201d rule any more, judging from the abundance of potato chips and protein bars in our lives. And yet, there\u2019s still a lingering sense of moral disapproval about snacking, which is strange given that most of us snack more often than we brush our teeth. The average American now eats nearly three commercial savory baked snacks (pretzels, popcorn, crackers, etc.) every day, and that\u2019s before we even start to factor in the cupcakes and the sodas, the energy balls and the toaster pastries.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What are your guilty pleasure snacks and your healthy snacks? Share your preferences below.\n\nBut there are snacks and snacks. Throughout history, there have been food cultures where the snack is accepted and ritualized rather than viewed with moral disapproval. In Tudor England, the day was generally broken up into two full meals\u2014a midday \u201cdinner\u201d and an evening \u201csupper\u201d\u2014with around three snacks in between. The first of the snacks was breakfast, which was unlike dinner in that it was consumed in private, without much ceremony. Between dinner and supper, Tudors enjoyed a snack called \u201cdrinking,\u201d equivalent to afternoon tea, which might be something like cakes and ale. At the very end of the day, after supper, came a snack called \u201call night,\u201d a kind of midnight feast of bread and wine.\n\nMaybe we wouldn\u2019t be so hostile to snacks if we could recognize them as a small meal in their own right, as many European cultures do. In France, children expect to be given \u201cle go\u00fbter\u201d after school, consisting of something like a small hunk of baguette and butter, or pancakes and jam with a glass of milk. A friend of mine moved to Sweden for a year and came back enamored of the tradition of \u201cfika,\u201d a sociable pause in the day to drink several cups of coffee with a cinnamon bun or wonderful homemade cakes. When enjoying their \u201cfika,\u201d the slender Swedes my friend met did not feel the need to berate themselves for their moral failings.\n\n\u201c There is no law that says a snack has to be unhealthy or factory made. \u201d\n\nSnacks are unjustly maligned as a way of eating, argues Meera Sodha, an Indian-British cookery writer whose latest book is \u201cEast: 120 Vegan and Vegetarian Recipes from Bangalore to Beijing,\u201d a collection of flavorsome and healthy Asian dishes. Ms. Sodha devotes a whole chapter in the book to \u201csnacks and small things\u201d and remarks that she would like to apply for the role of \u201cambassador for snacking.\u201d She is not talking about the mass-produced sugary snacks of the supermarket but the kind of fresh and vibrant tidbits eaten in modest quantities at any time of day in Asia.\n\n\u201cA life well lived,\u201d writes Ms. Sodha, \u201cis a life full of small edible delights: little opportunities of deliciousness that can be woven into a day.\u201d There is no law that says a snack has to be unhealthy or factory made. She points out that \u201cin Bangkok, a snack might be a freshly pounded salad: the rising smell of lemon grass, mixing with chili and garlic.\u201d Across Asia, people eat variations of stuffed dumplings such as the gyoza of Japan or the momos of Nepal, tasty morsels that are far more nutritious and interesting to eat than a muffin.\n\nMs. Sodha\u2019s book contains recipes for some truly delightful Asian-inspired savory snacks. My favorites so far are a cumin-spiked potato dosa with a refreshing pea and coconut chutney and a turmeric-yellow Vietnamese coconut pancake stuffed with a bright salad of shredded red cabbage with lime juice and mint. This is snacking as sheer joy.\n\nTo forswear snacking altogether would be to deprive ourselves of a whole world of savory tidbits, from deviled eggs to samosas. Last year in northern Italy, I ate one of the best snacks I\u2019ve ever tasted. It\u2019s called frico and is nothing but Montasio or Parmesan cheese grated and toasted in a pan until it forms a giant, lacy disk. You find yourself breaking off piece after piece of the crispy cheese, especially if you have a glass of Prosecco in your other hand.\n\nInstead of berating ourselves for eating snacks, we should allow ourselves to eat better ones and give them the attention they are due. Making yourself a snack is a good way to find out what you really crave, however eccentric, because with a snack, anything goes. At Prune restaurant in New York City, chef Gabrielle Hamilton serves a bar snack of canned sardines with triscuits, Dijon mustard, parsley and cornichons. No one would serve such a weird and salty collation for dinner, but as a snack, it is perfect. Sometimes, the best eating is the kind you do \u201cbetween meals.\u201d", "description": "Eating between meals doesn\u2019t have to be a vice, as long as we give our snacks the attention they deserve", "authors": ["Bee Wilson"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EX062_TALKTA_SOC_20190905113241.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
