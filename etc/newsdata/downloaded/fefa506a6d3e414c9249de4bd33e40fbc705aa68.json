It\u2019s no surprise, then, that major rivers all around the world carry some 1.15-2.41 million tons of plastic into our seas each year. But you can make an effort to reverse this harrowing trend by moving toward eco-conscious, reusable straws as alternatives. Here are five environmentally friendly options.\n\nThe FinalStraw 2.0, $25 on Amazon: FinalStraw raised $1.8 million on Kickstarter as the world\u2019s first collapsible straw. It\u2019s made of stainless steel, but it folds up to tuck away into a small keychain case you can put with your house or car keys. It\u2019s easy to tote with you, and it\u2019s easy to clean with the accompanying brush. Plus, it comes in a fun rainbow color.\n\nLifeStraw, $20 on Amazon: LifeStraw\u2019s original, award-winning personal straw was engineered for outdoor sports and emergency survival situations. It\u2019s unlike the other straws on this list in that it\u2019s not intended for use at a restaurant (though we don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t use it anywhere); rather it\u2019s designed so you can safely drink from rivers during multi-day treks or perhaps from buckets of tap water while traveling in developing areas. It removes bacteria, parasites, and microplastics, preventing the majority of waterborne diseases. And it weighs just two ounces but filters 1,000 gallons of drinking water, which is enough for one adventure aficionado over five years.\n\nBuhluh Bamboo Straws (8-Pack), $15 at Anthropologie: Buhluh's eco-friendly straws are a simple alternative. They\u2019re made from sustainably grown, organic bamboo, and they were carefully designed without any inks, dyes, or BPA plastics.\n\nSimply Straws Classic Single Sleeve Set, $21 on Amazon: Simply Straws\u2019 glass straws come in an array of fun colors, and this set comes with a sleeve for carrying. Each straw is dishwasher- and microwave-safe. And you can rest assured that they're BPA-free, non-porous, and hypo-allergenic.\n\nKlean Kanteen Colorful 5-Piece Straw Set, $10 on Amazon: Klean Kanteen\u2019s colorful straws are made from high-quality 18/8 stainless steel, and they\u2019re topped with safe, food-grade, removable silicone flex tips that make them comfortable to sip from. This set comes with a brush made of natural palm fiber bristles to easily clean your straws, as well.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
