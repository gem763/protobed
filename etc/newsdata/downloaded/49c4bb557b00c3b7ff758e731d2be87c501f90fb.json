They\u2019d had the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in their hands since the night before, a summary of the actual call to Ukraine, the Inspector General\u2019s letter outlining his interviews with suspect officials in the White House, and cameras trained on them for three hours.", "description": "They blew a prime opportunity to present the first coherent narrative of the remarkable revelations of the last few days.", "authors": ["Margaret Carlson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569534145/190926-Carlson-Maguire-tease_ppptzq", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
