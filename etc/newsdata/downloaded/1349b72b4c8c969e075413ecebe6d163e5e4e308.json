As well as the new races it also has a new story that involves both the Alliance and the Horde races fighting an elder god.\n\nThe update will also restore the Vale of Eternal Blossoms in Pandaria (home to the giant pandas that were previous winners of the \u2018cutest Warcraft race\u2019 award) and the N\u2019Zoth invasion of Uldum.\n\nThere\u2019s no official release date but the content will be added to the public test realm from today.\n\nWorld Of Warcraft \u2013 Mechagnomes aren\u2019t quite so cute\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "The massive new Visions of N\u2019Zoth 8.3 update will be bringing new races to World of Warcraft, as well as a brand-new story.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_2-1171_1570526848.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
