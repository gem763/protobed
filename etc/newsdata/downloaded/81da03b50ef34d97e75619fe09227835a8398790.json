The dysfunction has kept the U.S. central bank pumping money to quell a surge in short-term rates that was pushing up its policy benchmark rate. The operations also eased the pain of hedge funds and broker-dealers that need to finance their Treasury holdings.\n\nRepo glitches have cast a spotlight on how thoroughly the environment for short-term funding has changed since the 2008 credit crisis, according to bank executives, traders and observers of the market. They said that\u2019s even created a generational gap: Big banks and regulators have seen so little repo-market turmoil in recent years that they have lost some of their reflexes.\n\nMnuchin said he believes the Fed has resolved the technical issues that caused the glitch and he doesn\u2019t expect them to happen again, adding that any issues with regulations are separate.\n\nBut banks say a strict liquidity requirement instituted after the financial crisis is also a contributing factor.\n\nToo Big to Fail\n\nRegulations introduced after 2008 oblige financial institutions to hold more cash and cash-like assets as a buffer against times of stress. Systemically important banks -- JPMorgan is the largest in the U.S. -- face year-end reviews to determine how much more common equity they must carry.\n\nDimon has said his firm had the cash and willingness to calm repo markets when they went haywire in September, but regulations held it back.\n\nInstead, the Fed began daily liquidity injections, as market forces alone weren\u2019t able to calm the ructions. Even as repo rates have since returned to more normal levels, the Fed has also resumed purchases of Treasuries to bolster bank reserves.\n\nJPMorgan is building its case, with analysts warning that money-market stress is likely to get much worse despite the Fed\u2019s attempts to fix the problem. Conviction is also lacking that the central bank has resolved the issues in the funding markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable question: Have we gone too far in the other direction in requiring the banks to maintain this excess liquidity for intra-day operations?\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nWarren\u2019s Letter\n\nHowever, banks are unwilling to go negative with their accounts at the Fed, citing regulatory burdens.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to loosen the leash on Wall Street, but some of regulators\u2019 most meaningful efforts to revamp post-crisis constraints on big banks have run into problems.\n\nAny further effort to loosen the rules is also likely to face push-back. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, already waded into the debate around last month\u2019s repo turmoil, warning Mnuchin not to use the episode as a rationale for weakening post-crisis regulations.\n\nMnuchin\u2019s proposal \u201cis dangerous and it\u2019s the exact same direction that every single step taken by the Trump administration has gone, and that is make it a little easier for the banks to make a little more money with a little less oversight,\u201d Warren told reporters in Laconia, New Hampshire Tuesday.\n\n(Updates with comment from Elizabeth Warren, in last paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Liz Capo McCormick and Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Saleha Mohsin in Washington at smohsin2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, John Harney, Brendan Murray\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is open to loosening financial crisis-era regulations that have stiffened liquidity rules for big banks to relieve possible cash crunches in short-term funding markets.Mnuchin said in an interview Tuesday that he had spoken to Jamie Dimon, chief executive", "authors": ["Saleha Mohsin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gH9JWR1yE1R3Udv3nAX0gw--~B/aD0xMjQ4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/a6bd5d2ee471ecfa4a37b5d105c01705", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
