Never heard of that.\"\n\nShaun confirmed it was the correct answer, catching up with Alun and eliminating him from the game.\n\nBradley looked crestfallen on his behalf, shaking his hand and wishing the best for him and his family.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nFans headed over to Twitter to vent the frustration they felt on Alun's behalf.\n\nOne asked: \"Since when was it called butt dial? #thechase.\"\n\nAnother reckoned it was an American thing: \"It's not a butt dial. It's a bum dial. We're not American...\"\n\nA third was even more angry: \"Nobody calls it a f*****g butt dial either #TheChase.\"\n\nA fourth was less sympathetic, laughing: \"As if some guy on The Chase got beaten by the chaser because he thought the term butt dial was actually booty call.\"\n\nShaun's been stirring drama on the show recently after his chilly responses to player Kelly's blatant romantic advances.\n\nAfter he had caught up and beaten her in the game, she could be seen mouthing: \"I love you. Call me.\"\n\n\"I'm going back to the library,\" Shaun threatened after Bradley joked he could picture the two of them taking a stroll together hand-in-hand.", "description": "Even host Bradley Walsh admitted that he'd never heard the answer to a question that had fans and contestants scratching their heads", "authors": ["Rebecca Koncienzcy", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20715842.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_EHP_CHP_241019The-Chase_6754JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
