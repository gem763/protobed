Save one.\n\nThe South Bend mayor has left Joe Biden off his target list, content to see the former vice president fall on his own, after which\u2014the thinking goes\u2014his supporters will flock to a similarly mild-mannered moderate candidate; namely, Mayor Pete.\n\nThe strategy is a high-risk one for Buttigeig, even as he continues to stockpile resources that prepare him well for the final stages of the pre-voting phase of the primary; his campaign announced on Tuesday that it had raised $19.1 million in the third quarter. Indeed, the South Bend Democrat\u2019s attacks on his fellow rivals have begun to anger fellow party members, who view it all as a massive showcase of presumption from a 37-year-old mayor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to get some splash,\u201d an adviser to a top rival campaign said. \u201cHow do you get some splash? You go after the person who has the juice.\u201d\n\nA Buttigieg campaign official swears they\u2019re \u201cnot even trying to subtweet other people\u201d and only want to draw policy contrasts between more progressive rivals, which is why Biden is not currently a target. But officials in multiple 2020 campaigns contacted by The Daily Beast said they\u2019ve felt and noticed the mayor\u2019s slights in recent weeks, arguing he\u2019s taking veiled swipes to make up for a polling downturn.\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s calculation is always \u2018how can I offend the fewest voters,\u2019 so it\u2019s not surprising to see him attack candidates who dare to have an original idea,\u201d said another campaign official for a separate candidate.\n\nA third candidate\u2019s aide gave the grimmest possible explanation: \u201cIt does seem a little desperate.\u201d\n\nHovering slightly above 5 percent average in Real Clear Politics\u2019 national polling index, Buttigieg remains solidly within the top five Democratic contenders. But he\u2019s well behind Biden, who earns around 27 percent in the index, and is still a ways away from progressive rivals Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who earn 23 percent and nearly 18 percent, respectively.\n\nIn the past several weeks, Buttigieg has attempted to narrow that gap.\n\nA Harvard graduate often lauded for his bookish thoughtfulness, he was eager to draw contrasts between Warren, the former law professor from the same school, and Sanders, the self-avowed democratic socialist, over health care.\n\n\u201cShe and I are after the same goals,\u201d Buttigieg said to Bloomberg about Warren, who raised $19.1 million in the second quarter but has not yet released her third quarter haul. \u201cBut her pitch has a lot more to do with fighting\u2014she\u2019s more interested in the fighting part of it. I\u2019m more interested in outcomes.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats rushed to Warren\u2019s defense, pointing largely to her success conceiving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\u201cOutcomes? Elizabeth Warren created the CFPB and has been elected twice by millions of voters. Pete has won elections with numbers that rival student body presidents,\u201d progressive strategist Rebecca Katz tweeted.\n\n\u201cPete's posturing as more focused on outcomes than a woman who conceived of an entire federal agency, got it written into law and built is tiresome,\u201d Adam Jentleson, who previously served as a top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, wrote on Twitter. \u201cPete was on OK mayor of a small town (depending on who you ask) and could learn a lot from Warren if he had an ounce of humility.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Buttigieg jabbed Warren in recent weeks. In an appearance on The Late Show, the Massachusetts Democrat did not directly answer Stephen Colbert's question about whether middle-class taxes would increase under her health-care plan. Eyeing that, Buttiegig pounced.\n\n\u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we've seen that repeatedly,\u201d Buttigieg said in an interview on CNN shortly after. \u201cI think that if you are proud of your plan and it's the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms,\u201d he added.\n\nAn official from Buttigieg\u2019s campaign told The Daily Beast they were most interested in drawing contrasts with both Warren and Sanders on that specific policy concentration, pointing to the popularity of the mayor\u2019s plan and his more moderate credentials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about pointing out their differences on health care,\u201d the official said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to make personal attacks.\u201d\n\nStill, the progressive senators are not the only presidential contenders Buttigieg has singled out. He has also launched thinly veiled attacks on multiple candidates polling lower nationally.\n\nMore recently, Buttigieg\u2019s husband Chasten launched a slight attack at Cory Booker (D-NJ)\u2014a claim his campaign denies\u2014in a fundraising appeal before the third quarter deadline in which he touted the campaign\u2019s progress but noted, \u201cthe pressure is on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by pressure, I don\u2019t mean the campaign will shut down if we don\u2019t raise $1.5 million by 11:59 p.m. tonight,\u201d Chasten wrote in his note.\n\nThe line\u2013referencing a highly specific dollar goal by a precise time of the day\u2013appeared to be a swipe at Booker, whose campaign reported raising over $6 million in the third quarter, amassing $2.1 million in the last 10 days of September. Booker\u2019s campaign manager Addisu Demissie told reporters last month that if they didn\u2019t raise an addition $1.7 million by Sept. 30, they did not have a \u201clegitimate long-term path forward\u201d to continue competing in the 2020 contest.\n\nA separate attack came as Buttigieg sought to create a contrast with another contender who once received similar rising star status: former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX). After O\u2019Rourke earned applause during the third Democratic debate for declaring, \u201chell yes, we\u2019re going to take our AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d Buttigieg argued that the Texas Democrat was only helping the other side.\n\nTrump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are \u201cat least are pretending to be open to reforms,\u201d Buttigieg said, who received pushback from O\u2019Rourke himself. \u201cWe know we have a moment on our hands. Let\u2019s make the most of it and get these things done.\u201d\n\nAs the digs have piled up, so has the annoyance of Buttigieg\u2019s primary opponents. Making a case to voters in Iowa, the South Bend mayor once again leaned on his Washington-outsider status while launching a vague dig at up to three possible rivals, saying that politics is about more than \u201cthe daily drama of who looked good in a committee meeting.\u201d\n\nSens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Booker each sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee. But it was Harris who received disproportionate praise for her grilling of Attorney General William Barr, a clip her campaign has recently resurfaced to get her back into the national conversation.\n\nWhen presented with the possibility that Buttigieg\u2019s comment was a dig at Harris, one prominent backer of the California Democrat threw some shade back.\n\n\u201cIf it is [an attack on Harris] he is losing,\u201d the ally said.", "description": "The South Bend mayor has gone after many of his primary rivals in recent weeks, save one.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569982509/191001-trudo-buttigieg-tease_qcc1hl"}
