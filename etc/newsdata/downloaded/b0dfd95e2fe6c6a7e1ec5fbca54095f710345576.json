Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. How are you so sure that you can?\n\nFORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Because I\u2019ve watched it, I know what the job is. I\u2019ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office thing time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders, from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track\u2026. I know what has to be done. I won\u2019t need any one the job training. And I will release my medical records as I have 21-years of my tax records, which no one on this stage has done, so you can have full transparency as to my health and what I\u2019m doing.\n\nBURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?\n\nBIDEN: Before the first vote.\n\nBURNETT: Before Iowa?\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nBURNETT: Not by the end of this year?\n\nBIDEN: Well, before Iowa. I\u2019ve released them before. I\u2019ve released 55 pages. I\u2019m the only one who has released anything.", "description": "Joe Biden falsely claimed that he is the only 2020 candidate to release documents such as his tax returns or medical records.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1181329684-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
