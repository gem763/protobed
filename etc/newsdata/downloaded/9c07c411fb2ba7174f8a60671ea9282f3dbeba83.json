It\u2019s a sign that the market\u2019s downturn has begun to bottom out, analysts at Savills said.\n\n\n\nMore: The Smarter Way to Clean Your Home\n\nHome prices across London\u2019s poshest postcodes, areas like Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and the City of London, averaged \u00a34.4 million (US$5.41 million) in the third quarter, a 3% decline from the same time last year. On a square footage basis, homes traded for an average \u00a31,750 per square foot in the third quarter.\n\n\n\nThe latest figures mean homes in this area are more than 20% cheaper than they were at the market\u2019s last peak in 2014, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis broad price correction across prime central London is comparable with falls seen post-[great financial crisis] and in the downturns of the early \u201980s and early \u201990s, suggesting the market is now close to a full re-pricing,\u201d said Lucian Cook, head of Savills residential research.\n\n\n\nBut broader economic and political uncertainty surrounding Brexit, which has become even more decisive in recent weeks as the country approaches an Oct. 31 exit deadline, create the primary obstacle to improved sales and pricing, according to a majority of Savills\u2019s London agents.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Art Collection of Ron Miller and Diane Disney Miller Heads to Auction\n\n\u201cWe expect buyer and seller caution to prevail through the remainder of the year as negotiations with the EU continue. The prospect of a general election only adds to this,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the report.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, international buyers are acting as a counterweight to the drop-off in domestic demand for homes in London.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growing pool of domestic and international money waiting to exploit a perceived buying opportunity,\u201d he added.", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-112753?size=1.3333333333333333&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
