However, it has in recent months conducted 11 short-range missile tests, the latest a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) capable of hitting Japan and South Korea.\n\nWhile Trump has dismissed the recent tests as insignificant, the European members of the U.N. Security Council strongly condemned the latest tests in a statement issued Tuesday.\n\nThe foreign ministry spokesman hit out at the Security Council statement, claiming the tests were for self-defense and that Washington was behind the condemnation.\n\nThe North Korean spokesman also pointed to a U.S. Air Force test of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile this month, noting the U.N. Security Council did not condemn that test, even though it was \u201cclearly carried out in order to pressure us.\u201d\n\nREAD: 5 Reasons Trump Should Be Way More Concerned About North Korea's Submarine Missile Launch\n\nNorth Korea said it could make a response \u201con the same level\u201d but is refraining from doing so for now.\n\nAccording to Pyongyang, last weekend\u2019s talks \u2014 the first since the failed Hanoi summit in February \u2014 broke down because the U.S. had come to the table \u201cempty-handed\u201d despite the demand from Kim that Washington approach negotiations with a \u201cnew method of calculation.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. tried to paint a more optimistic picture, with the State Department describing the talks as \u201cgood discussions\u201d that would allow negotiators to make progress in the coming months.\n\nWhile Sweden did invite the two sides to return for further talks later this month, North Korea said it would not hold \u201csuch sickening negotiations\u201d until Washington takes a \u201csubstantial step\u201d to withdraw its \u201chostile policy.\u201d\n\nCover: In this Thursday, July 25, 2019, photo provided on Friday, July 26, 2019, by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watches a missile test in North Korea.
