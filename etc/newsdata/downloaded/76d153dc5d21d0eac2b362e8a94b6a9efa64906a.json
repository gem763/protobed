Anthony Rendon and Juan Soto hit back-to-back home runs off Clayton Kershaw to tie the game. Howie Kendrick hit a grand slam in the 10th. The NLCS begins tomorrow night in St. Louis. First pitch is 8:08 p.m. No, this is not a fever dream.\n\n\u2026 AND NEITHER IS THIS: FOUR-COLUMN HEADLINE on today\u2019s NYT front page: \u201cTURKEY ATTACKS U.S. ALLY IN SYRIA\u201d\n\nAP/CEYLANPINAR, Turkey: \u201cTurkish ground forces pressed their advance against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Thursday, Turkey\u2019s Defense Ministry said, launching airstrikes and unleashing artillery shelling on Syrian towns and villages the length of its border.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish invasion, now in its second day, has been widely condemned around the world. In northern Syria, residents of the border areas scrambled in panic on Wednesday as they tried to get out on foot, in cars and with rickshaws piled with mattresses and a few belongings. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Kurds, who have been America\u2019s only allies in Syria fighting the Islamic State group, stopped on Thursday all their operations against the IS extremists in order to focus on fighting advancing Turkish troops, Kurdish and U.S. officials said.\u201d AP\n\nWAPO FRONT PAGE \u2026 PHIL RUCKER and BOB COSTA: \u201cTrump\u2019s Syria decision tests the bounds of Republican support as he demands solidarity on impeachment\u201d: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria has angered evangelical Christian leaders and Republican hawks, cleaving his political coalition at the very moment he is trying to fortify his standing to survive the intensifying impeachment inquiry in Congress.\n\n\u201cInstead of enjoying uncontested GOP support as he plunges into a constitutional showdown with House Democrats and prepares for a bruising reelection campaign, Trump is now fighting on two fronts within his party.\u201d WaPo\n\nOFFICIALS IN BOTH PARTIES practically guarantee that a package sanctioning Turkey will pass Congress in the coming weeks.\n\nAS OF NOW, Turkish President RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN is coming to Washington in the coming weeks -- the administration says. It will be Erdo\u011fan and Trump vs. the rest of the town.\n\nFOR YOUR RADAR -- \u201cIntel officials say ISIS could regroup after U.S. \u2018betrayal\u2019 of Kurds in Syria,\u201d by NBC\u2019s Ken Delanian and Dan De Luce: \u201cA sustained Turkish military operation against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria \u2014 which President Donald Trump appears to have permitted \u2014 would vastly increase the threat to Americans from the Islamic State militant group, which remains intent on attacking the West, current and former intelligence officials tell NBC News.\n\n\u201cThe immediate concern, officials say, is what will happen with the 12,000 ISIS fighters currently being guarded by the American-backed Kurds. The ISIS prisoners are the world's largest concentration of terrorists. If those fighters are set free, officials fear a replay of what happened in Iraq between 2010 and 2013, when the core group who founded ISIS were released or escaped from detention after U.S. forces left the country.\u201d NBC\n\n-- @realDonaldTrump: \u201cIn case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles, out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst!\u201d\n\n-- NYT: \u201cAt the Pentagon, where more than five years of fighting alongside Kurdish troops in Iraq and Syria has now given way to standing aside as those same allies are attacked, some officials said there was more anger than they had seen at any point in Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\u201d\n\nA message from The Coalition Against Socialized Medicine: Nancy Pelosi\u2019s drug pricing proposal would put foreign bureaucrats in control of Americans\u2019 medicine cabinet, lead to access restrictions for America\u2019s patients, and stifle innovation, threatening the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow.

And as someone wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy, as an example. They mentioned the names of different battles, but they\u2019re there to help us with their land, and that\u2019s a different thing.\u201d\n\n-- THE PRESIDENT said Wednesday that since Democrats \u201chave a tiny margin in the House, they have eviscerated the rules.\u201d In fact, in our system of government, whoever is in the House majority gets to write the rules -- no matter how large the majority.\n\nAND ABOUT THESE NEW TALKING POINTS: The president and his allies have latched onto a theory that Republicans should be afforded subpoena power in the impeachment probe because it was done in the past. Minority subpoena power is a real thing. But those subpoenas are always subject to a full-committee vote -- and the committees are still controlled by Democrats.\n\n-- AND THE PRESIDENT keeps saying he wants a vote to start the impeachment probe. A few Republicans have pointed out to us that they don\u2019t want this vote at all. They have no idea where this probe is heading, and they don\u2019t want to be on the record against it -- if they don\u2019t need to be.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

In July, 42 percent favored impeachment and removal, while 5 percent said impeach but don\u2019t remove him, and 45 percent opposed impeachment.\u201d Fox News\n\n-- FIVETHIRTYEIGHT IMPEACHMENT AVERAGE: 49.2% support, 43.3% don\u2019t support. 538\n\n-- HEADS UP \u2026 HAPPENING TODAY \u2026 NYT\u2019S NICK FANDOS on A1: \u201cHouse chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry planned to issue additional subpoenas for witness testimony and records related to Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as soon as Thursday, lawmakers and aides said, after a pause for the Jewish High Holy Days.\n\n\u201cThey want to force executive branch officials to answer to their demands, generating a detailed record of refusals that could shape an impeachment article charging Mr. Trump with obstructing Congress. Democrats also still see other meaningful avenues for gathering evidence that go around the Trump administration\u2019s defiance, including questioning private citizens, former officials, career diplomats near retirement and the whistle-blowers whose revelations fueled the inquiry.\u201d NYT\n\n-- KYLE CHENEY and HEATHER CAYGLE: \u201cDemocrats confident in obstruction case against Trump \u2014 but want more\u201d: \u201cHouse Democrats are increasingly confident they have all the evidence they need to impeach President Donald Trump for obstructing their investigations. \u2026 But they\u2019re not prepared to impeach Trump on obstruction of Congress alone. As they contemplate their impeachment strategy, Democrats say they prefer any obstruction charge to play a supporting, rather than starring, role in their efforts.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NANCY COOK: \u201c\u2018There is no discernible legal strategy\u2019: Trump returns to his roots for impeachment battle\u201d\n\n-- TREY GOWDY has formally joined the president\u2019s personal legal team, per a statement Wednesday night by counsel Jay Sekulow, and will no longer be a commentator for Fox News.

They said other participants in the Oval Office were shocked by the request.\n\n\u201cTillerson immediately repeated his objections to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly in a hallway conversation just outside the Oval Office, emphasizing that the request would be illegal. Neither episode has been previously reported, and all of the people spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the conversations.\u201d Bloomberg\n\n-- BEHIND THE STRATEGERY: NYT\u2019S ELIZABETH WILLIAMSON: \u201cAs White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone Builds Case for Defiance on Impeachment\u201d: \u201cAs a lawyer in private practice, Pat A. Cipollone, now President Trump\u2019s White House counsel, told colleagues that there were two approaches to legal fights.\n\n\u201cOne, he said, was like the Department of State, when the two sides would try to work out a deal to avoid painful and expensive litigation. The other, when the first failed, was the Department of War. As of this week, Mr. Cipollone has put himself squarely in the war camp when it comes to Mr. Trump\u2019s defense against the House impeachment inquiry.\u201d NYT\n\n-- GONESVILLE! \u2026 AP\u2019S JILL COLVIN: \u201cWhite House aides try disappearing act amid impeachment talk\u201d: \u201cThey\u2019ve skipped the high-profile Sunday TV shows and avoided driveway chat sessions with reporters. Few who are typically eager to defend the president have appeared at all on television so far this month.\n\n\u201cWhite House officials close to President Donald Trump are pulling off a disappearing act, remaining largely absent from public view \u2014 in the middle of the storm over impeachment.\u201d AP\n\n-- CNN: \u201cWilliam Barr, for now, avoids Democrats\u2019 impeachment scrutiny,\u201d by Evan Perez, Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb: \u201cDemocrats \u2026 have turned their investigative targets elsewhere, mostly on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the White House and the State Department, which is the center of what Democrats say was a corrupt effort by the President to withhold congressionally approved aid for Ukraine in exchange for a Ukrainian probe to dig up dirt on the Bidens.

His Rudy Giuliani joke had the crowd roaring, as did his digs on Trump\u2019s tax secrecy.\n\n\u201cIt was just the kind of crowd energy that the Biden campaign had hoped to tap as it abruptly shifted gears on Wednesday, revealing a new intensity and an amped up response to the president\u2019s relentless attacks.\n\n\u201cFor a Biden campaign lagging in fundraising, polls and enthusiasm, the former vice president\u2019s roll-out of a swaggering, fire-breathing approach and full embrace of impeachment signaled a dramatic departure from course \u2014 a change in direction necessitated by weeks of Trump\u2019s siege warfare.\n\n\u201cFor weeks, Biden spoke cautiously about impeaching the president, even as every other major Democratic candidates called for it. As Trump repeatedly blasted unproven allegations of wrongdoing against the Bidens, Biden wasn\u2019t aggressive enough for Democrats who want the fight taken to the president.\n\n\u201cBut in speeches at two events here on Wednesday, Biden attacked the president in the sharpest and most personal terms he\u2019s used since entering the Democratic primary. For the first time, he directly called for Trump\u2019s impeachment. He accused the president of spreading lies and of attempting to extort another country. He even pivoted to ripping on Trump\u2019s lawyer, Giuliani, mocking him as a man of great \u2018integrity.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was his most aggressive posture to date, presenting a case that Trump could not be trusted, while positioning himself as the fighter that America needs at this moment to face off against a \u2018bully\u2019 and a \u2018coward.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- TRUMP IN MINNESOTA TONIGHT \u2026 NYT\u2019S ANNIE KARNI and MAGGIE HABERMAN: \u201cTrump Is Serious About Carrying Minnesota, the One That Got Away in 2016\u201d: \u201cIt is a rare rally for Mr. Trump in a state he did not win in 2016, and takes him to the heart of opposition territory: In 2018, the city helped elect to the House Ilhan Omar, a Democratic woman of color who has become one of the president\u2019s favorite foils.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s campaign manager, is planning to pour tens of millions of dollars into the campaign\u2019s Minnesota operation, compared with the $30,000 the Trump campaign spent on the state last cycle. The campaign already has 20 paid staff members in the state, and expects to expand to 100. And the campaign and the Republican National Committee are outspending Democrats by about four to one on digital advertising, according to campaign officials and local Democratic Party officials.\u201d NYT\n\n-- THE FINE PRINT \u2026 NBC\u2019S MARK MURRAY: \u201c[I]n a statement to NBC News, the Warren campaign clarified that the candidate would indeed attend high-dollar events for the party (where individuals can donate tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars) \u2014 though not for the campaign (where the maximum primary and general election donation is a combined $5,600).\u201d NBC\n\nBIG DOUGH ALERT ...

It's marked a major shift from how the outlet had previously covered the president. \u2026\n\n\u201cOne explanation for Drudge's aggressive coverage could be that he wants to play a role in a second presidential impeachment.

Whether it be the wholesale elimination and prohibition of private insurance and imposition of socialized medicine in the form of Sen. Sanders\u2019 $32 trillion Medicare for All plan, or Speaker Pelosi\u2019s glidepath toward the same goal with her prescription drug pricing plan, these misguided proposals pose grave threats to the quality and availability of every single Americans\u2019 health care, to the cutting-edge treatments and cures of tomorrow, and to our nation\u2019s economy. Single payer health care schemes and drug price controls have been tried abroad with the same results: access restrictions for patients, decisions made by bureaucrats rather than patients and doctors, stifled innovation, and crippling taxes. This is not the policy prescription for health care in America.
