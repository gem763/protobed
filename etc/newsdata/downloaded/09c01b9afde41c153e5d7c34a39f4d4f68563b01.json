Similarly, Crowdstrike\u2019s stock took a hit earlier in the month as its outlook, too, became less aggressive than in the past.\n\nZscaler also introduced its B2B product, a service that limits the attack surface of network applications that are connected to the internet.\n\n\u201cWith Zscaler B2B, external users only receive admittance to the exact resources and applications needed to do their job, helping organizations to securely collaborate while granting them fast, policy-based access to business-critical resources,\u201d said Patrick Foxhoven, Zscaler chief information officer and vice president of emerging technologies.\n\nRead: A year after Equifax, cybersecurity is still seeking its Holy Grail\n\nLastly, Zscaler announced that its platform was being distributed over 150 data centers across the globe with its latest opening in Val-du-Roi, Normandy, France. The presence of physical data centers across the globe minimizes the latency between the platform and the user.\n\n\u201cIf a threat is detected anywhere, customers are protected everywhere within seconds,\u201d said Amit Sinha, Zscaler chief technology officer and president of research and development, operations and customer service, in a statement. \u201cEvery time a new threat is identified in any of the more than 70 billion requests processed daily by the Zscaler cloud, it gets blocked for all Zscaler users, everywhere.\u201d\n\nCybersecurity has become a hot space recently, not only with IPOs from Crowdstrike and, most recently, Cloudflare Inc. NET, +0.64%, but also with a ramping up of long-overdue \u201ca buy or be bought\u201d mentality settling in as VMware Inc. VMW, -1.33% announced an acquisition of cybersecurity company Carbon Black Inc. CBLK, +0.04% Broadcom Inc. AVGO, +0.06% made a bid for Symantec Corp.\u2019s SYMC, +0.70% enterprise business, and BlackBerry Ltd.\u2019s BB, +0.13% acquisition of Cylance in February.", "description": "Zscaler Inc. shares rally Tuesday following a blitz of announcements that includes a partnership with cybersecurity company Crowdstrike Holdings Inc.", "authors": ["Wallace Witkowski"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR463_zscale_ZG_20190917135929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
