Dance was a huge part of her life.\n\nBut one morning, when she was 14, she woke up and felt so unwell, she could barely move.\n\nKate quickly deteriorated and was eventually diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nEventually, Kate started to use a wheelchair and she thought she would have to leave the world of dancing behind.\n\nBut now, age 25, Kate has built up the strength and is now teaching ballet from her wheelchair.\n\nKate, from Northumberland, says that although she has a huge amount of experience in practising and teaching ballet, the world of dance is inaccessible and she faces a lot of judgement.\n\nKate started ballet dancing when she was younger (Picture: Kate Stanforth)\n\nShe explains: \u2018It is quite a judgemental industry anyway but when you are a disabled dance teacher, people immediately judge you 10 times more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018People think that because I\u2019m in a wheelchair or because I\u2019ve got my walking stick that day that I\u2019m not capable but I know that I\u2019m a really good teacher.\u2019\n\nKate fell in love with dance as a child and she was already committed to becoming a professional before she even left primary school.\n\nShe explains: \u2018It was a huge part of my life. I would get up early and train and then do more after school and on weekends.\n\n\u2018Then basically overnight, I had to give it all up.\u2019\n\nKate also raises awareness of chronic illness (Picture: Kate Stanforth)\n\nThe first signs of M.E. appeared suddenly, and initially, Kate and her family thought that she would get better.\n\n\u2018I woke up one morning and I had to crawl up the stairs. I just didn\u2019t have the energy to walk up them. I couldn\u2019t do anything. I was so exhausted.\u2019\n\nKate and her family couldn\u2019t understand what had happened and spent years going back and forth to doctors, eventually leading to her diagnosis of M.E.\n\nAlthough she now had a name for her condition, there were few treatment options and she continued to get worse.\n\nKate is now teaching dance from her wheelchair (Picture: Hannah Todd)Photography\n\n\u2018I just seemed to deteriorate. I started using a wheelchair, then became bed-bound and at one point I had paralysis,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t even have the energy to think about dance any more. Sometimes I would bump into someone from dancing and it was extremely difficult thinking I couldn\u2019t do that anymore.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKate hoped that her condition would improve and she would one day be able to dance again but a few years after her first diagnosis, she was also told she had Ehlers-Danos Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder.\n\n\u2018At that stage, I realised it wasn\u2019t going to get better and my dance career was over. I was never going to be a professional dancer.\u2019\n\nBut over time, Kate slowly started to build her strength up and was able to walk a little.\n\nKate blogs about her condition (Picture: Kate Stanforth)\n\nShe decided once again to return to the world of dance, working as a professional teacher.\n\nShe managed to secure a teaching assistant job and completed her teachers associate exam.\n\nKate says: \u2018Just doing the exam was difficult for me because it is about an hour and a half long.\n\n\u2018I had to build my strength up to do it. It took me about a year and then I was able to start teaching. I had a health relapse and had to pause it but now I\u2019m back teaching from my wheelchair and I\u2019m also trying to do a little bit of dance myself.\u2019\n\nShe now teaches one class a week for about 45 minutes but says that she does feel like disabled people are treated differently in the dance industry.\n\nShe explains: \u2018I got most of my jobs through people who knew me and word of mouth. I\u2019ve applied for lots of dance teaching jobs and never even heard back. I have all the qualifications but I think people immediately judge you on your disability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Accessibility in dance needs to improve. There needs to be more opportunities \u2013 there are hardly any disabled dance classes and it\u2019s so hard to find wheelchair-accessible studios with accessible toilets and changing rooms.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s also not a lot of representation for disabled people in dance. I think we need to start showing disabled people in dance and representing everyone.\u2019\n\nKate wants to see more help available for disabled people who want to dance (Picture: Hannah Todd Photography)\n\nKate adds that she thinks more widespread views about disability make people frightened to get involved in dance.\n\n\u2018People are scared to dance or to show that they\u2019re doing anything physical because it might seem like because they can do a dance class, they are lying about the benefits they need.\n\n\u2018People need to be encouraged to be active though because it can really help to build strength and can have a positive impact.\u2019\n\nKate also says there isn\u2019t enough access to wheelchairs that people can use for sports and many people, including Kate, have to fund them themselves.\n\nShe says: \u2018There just isn\u2019t enough equipment available and it\u2019s a massive barrier for disabled people to be able to do sport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s such a shame because I know so many people who want to dance and be active. Every time I put something up on Twitter, I get so many messages from people wanting to dance but it is difficult.\u2019\n\nYou can follow Kate\u2019s story on her blog, on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nMORE: You Don\u2019t Look Sick: \u2018You might think I look better but I still feel horrible every day\u2019\n\nMORE: You Don\u2019t Look Sick: \u2018Having M.E. is like you\u2019ve ran a marathon with the flu and were beaten up afterwards\u2019\n\nMORE: Meet Douglas \u2013 the cat who thinks he\u2019s a dog\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Kate Stanforth has myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome) and wants to make dance more accessible.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_0660_PRINT-1389_1572188836.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
