During full and new moons, a huge tide surges in from the Atlantic Ocean and reverses the flow of the mighty river, creating an enormous wave.\n\nCalled the \u201cpororoca,\u201d this nearly endless wave is an example of a tidal bore. The strongest tidal bores occur on the biannual equinoxes in September and March when the sun, moon and earth align, bringing the tides to their highest peak. Surfers flock to Brazil to ride one of the longest waves in the world, but they must be careful to dodge trees and even jungle animals that are caught up in the rushing water.\n\nAs the moon orbits the earth, gravity pulls the Earth\u2019s oceans towards it creating tides and making our planet a little less round \u2014 more like the shape of a rugby ball instead of a sphere. At the same time, the pull slows down the earth\u2019s rotation making each day just a tiny bit longer.\n\nMORE:\n\nScientists Measure How Dramatically Our Earth Changes In A Single Day\n\nEvery day on earth the world\u2019s plants grow 300 million tonnes, the same as an oak tree 3.5 km high\n\nWatch the full story above.
