And with the third generation of its modular device, the Dutch company is living up to its promise of a truly and easily repairable device.\n\nEditor's Note: The Fairphone 3 is not currently available in Australia, so we can only gaze on with envy.\n\nOn Friday, repair outfit iFixit published its teardown of the Fairphone 3, awarding the phone a perfect score of 10 out of 10 on its scale of repairability (a high honour also bestowed on the Fairphone 2, which released in 2015).\n\nThe latest generation of Fairphone, which runs Android 9, has seven primary modules that can be easily swapped out for repair parts supplied by the company. With a focus on responsibly sourced and conflict-free materials, the company positions itself as a rare outlier in the smartphone industry by building what it calls \u201clong-lasting and sustainable phones.\u201d\n\nSee, was that so hard? (Photo: iFixIt)\n\nFrom the sound of it, the Fairphone 3 \u2014 the largest model yet at 158 x 71.8 x 9.89mm, according to its specs \u2014 lives up to its promise of easy repair.\n\nAccording to iFixIt\u2019s teardown, the back of the phone can be removed without any tools, and the phone\u2019s battery can be easily lifted out as well using a notch at its base. From there, a screwdriver that comes standard with each Fairphone 3 can be used to separate the display from the frame.\n\nInside, you\u2019ll find the top module, bottom module, speaker module, and camera module, all of which can be swapped out with replacement parts. (Though iFixit notes that modules and parts are not able to be switched out between the Fairphone 2 and its successor.)\n\nBeyond the user-friendly primary components, iFixit was able to tear down the phone\u2019s modules further and concluded that most of the parts contained within each could also be individually repaired and were removable with a Torx T5 screwdriver.\n\nAccording to iFixit, \u201cReassembling this phone won\u2019t be much of an issue, and we\u2019re very confident it\u2019ll still work.\u201d iFixit also commended the availability of user guides and OEM available on Fairphone\u2019s site.\n\nThe company says it currently only ships to European countries, but Fairphone notes on its website that it does plan to expand to \u201ca selection of countries\u201d outside of Europe.", "description": "In terms of building a more ethical smartphone that meets even the high bar set by repair nerds, Fairphone fits the bill.
