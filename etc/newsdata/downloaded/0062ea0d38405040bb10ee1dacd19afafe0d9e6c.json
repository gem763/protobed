The New Paper\n\nRemember the 2005 SARS epidemic? Or the recent ebola outbreak?\n\nAs it turns out, all of the countries in the world are not ready to deal with epidemics or pandemics, according to the inaugural Global Health Security (GHS) Index conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\n\nIn its report, the EIU found that Singapore ranks below Malaysia, and is only slightly more prepared than Indonesia, to deal with a pandemic.\n\nThe GHS Index released on Friday (Oct 25) showed that only 13 countries, including Thailand and South Korea, can be considered \u201cmost prepared\u201d \u2013 but none are fully prepared.\n\nSingapore ranked 24th out of 195 countries, with an overall index score of 58.7 \u2013 six places behind Malaysia, which had an index score of 62.2.\n\nA joint project between the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) and Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the average overall GHS Index score globally was 40.2 out of a possible score of 100. Even among the 60 high-income countries assessed, the average score was barely above the midpoint at 51.9.\n\nGlobally, the US was the most prepared with an index score of 83.5, followed by the United Kingdom at 77.9 and Netherlands at 75.6.\n\nRegionally, Thailand (73.2) took top spot as the most prepared in Asia, followed by South Korea (70.2).\n\nThe countries that were graded \u201cmore prepared\u201d included Malaysia, Japan (59.8), Singapore, Indonesia (56.6), Vietnam (49.1), China (48.2), the Phillippines (47.6) and India (46.5).\n\nSingapore better at responding, not committed to improving\n\nSingapore excelled in \u201crespond\u201d, but scored poorly for the \u201cnorms\u201d category. GHS Singapore profile\n\nThe study assesses countries\u2019 preparedness by looking at 34 indicators across six categories \u2013 prevention, detection, response, health system, adherence to global norms, and political and security risk.\n\nSingapore achieved its highest ranking of 11th for \u201crespond\u201d, which measures the ability to rapidly respond to and mitigate the spread of an epidemic.\n\nAdditionally, it scored 100 marks for the indicators of biosafety, data integration, linking health and security authorities, risk communication, trade and travel restrictions and infrastructure adequacy.\n\nHowever, it got zero marks on the indicators for exercising response plans, communication with healthcare workers during an emergency, cross-border agreements and the \u201cdual-use of research and culture of responsible science\u201d.\n\nThe Lion City was also weighed down by its low rank of 101 for the \u201cnorms\u201d category, which measures a country\u2019s adherence to global norms.\n\nMalaysia did better than Singapore in almost every category.\n\nMalaysia scored better than Singapore in all categories except response and risk. GHS Malaysia profile\n\nMalaysia did relatively well in all areas, but excelled in the category of \u201cdetection\u201d \u2013 achieving an index score of 73.2 and placing 28th in the world.\n\nSimilarly to Singapore, it scored maximum marks for the indicators of data integration, linking public health and security authorities and trade and travel restrictions.\n\nOn top of that, it also scored full marks for communication with public healthcare workers during emergencies, infection control practices and availability of equipment, and cross-border agreements.\n\nMore improvements needed globally\n\nIn order to improve preparedness, the report said that governments should test, measure, and publish health security capacities at least once every two years.\n\nThe report also said that leaders should increase commitment to address health security issues and improve coordination in \u201cinsecure environments\u201d, especially links between security and public health securities.\n\nAdditionally, new financing mechanisms should be established to fill preparedness gaps.\n\nErnest J. Moniz, co-chair and CEO of NTI said: \u201cThe bottom line is that global biological risks are growing \u2013 in many cases faster than health systems, security, science, and governments can keep up\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that all countries are prepared to respond to these risks,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - Singapore ranked 24th, six places behind Malaysia.\u00a0.
