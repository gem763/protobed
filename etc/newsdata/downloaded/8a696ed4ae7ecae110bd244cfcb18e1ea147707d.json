The Rice training staff immediately ran across to the field to the far sideline to attend to Green, who was placed on a backboard.\n\nGreen gave a thumbs-up sign as he left the field.\n\nAfter a 10-minute delay, play resumed with Tom Stewart in at quarterback. The Owls scored on the next play, a 1-yard run by Aston Walter to cut Wake Forest\u2019s lead to 14-7.
