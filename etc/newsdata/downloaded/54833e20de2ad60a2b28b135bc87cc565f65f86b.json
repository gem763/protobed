USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 This 115th World Series, already roiled by an ugly and protracted incident involving the Houston Astros that remains under investigation, will at least be spared a potential public skewering of a sitting president suffering through an impeachment inquiry.\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred said before Friday night\u2019s Game 3 that he had a conversation with President Trump regarding his attending a potential Game 5 on Sunday, and that the president opted out of a potential first pitch or other public appearance \u201cin order to make the fan experience as positive as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe actually had a conversation with him about first pitches,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cHis view was that in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible, he would arrive at Game 5 sometime after the game began so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with fans getting into the stadium.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, we were very grateful for that. We thought it was a great decision on the President\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nGame 5's first pitch will be thrown out by chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who has a long-running feud with Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating reached a new low of 37% earlier this month, according to a CNBC poll. The survey found 47% of Americans oppose impeachment, while 44% approve.\n\nTrump at the College Football Playoff championship game in January 2018.

MLB will continue to investigate both the incident and the erroneous and poorly-crafted initial statement the Astros released in response to the story.\n\nManfred also made reference to \u201caspects of this that go beyond the incident,\u201d and \u201cother things we want to talk to the Astros about.\u201d\n\nThursday, Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow refused to specify who wrote or was ultimately responsible for the statement attacking reporter Stephanie Apstein and vigorously defending Taubman. Luhnow did acknowledge he viewed the statement before it was released.\n\nLuhnow met with Apstein in the dugout prior to Game 3 on Friday.\n\nManfred refused comment on whether he had greater concerns about the Astros\u2019 organizational culture. The club has had several media-related incidents in recent years, including the barring of a reporter from the clubhouse at the request of ace Justin Verlander earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI would say that there a variety of issues; I\u2019m not going to narrow it to the statement,\u201d said Manfred, who said any action from MLB wouldn\u2019t occur until after the World Series.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to review the situation and have conversations. It\u2019s one thing to come and investigate, in 24 hours, a specific incident. This will take a little more time.\u201d", "description": "Commissioner Rob Manfred said Trump opted out of throwing the first pitch before Game 5 \u201cin order to make the fan experience as positive as possible.\u201d", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
