This was the hour officials had worried about most, when earlier forecasts had warned of a potential landfall and a near-certain massive storm surge.\n\nAnd the cyclone did rage: rough waves ravaged beaches and ocean water spilled over sand barriers; winds felled trees and power lines, leaving thousands without electricity; and heavy rains flooded roads and made driving dangerous. But this strip of coastal South Carolina, known as the Grand Strand, was expecting much worse \u2014 because residents here have been through it as recently as 2018.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be one of those storms that goes down in our history or in our record books,\u201d said Thomas Bell, the spokesman for Horry County\u2019s emergency management agency. \u201cThis was not a disaster or a catastrophe \u2014 especially compared to some of the storms we\u2019ve seen recently, like Florence last year.\u201d\n\nThe day began with the ominous strobes of a county\u2019s-worth of cellphones, all blaring emergency alert messages and warning of the potential arrival of one or more tornadoes. At least two did touch down \u2014 in North Myrtle Beach and nearby Little River \u2014 and damaged homes, forcing some to evacuate.\n\n\u201cThat was certainly a rude awakening for pretty much the entire county,\u201d Bell said.\n\nAfter those dissipated, residents turned their attention back to the eye of the storm, which was creeping slowly north. At first, the projections were ominous. But then, as Dorian passed Winyah Bay, south of Georgetown, its eye jutted east before moving farther up the coast \u2014 a redirection that likely spared the state some of its worst-case scenarios, Bell said.\n\n\u201cThis storm will probably go down as one of the weirdest ones,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a very hard one to keep your thumb on in terms of impacts. \u2026 Fortunately, it was not as they said it would be.\u201d\n\nOfficials are still worried about flooding, especially around the Waccamaw River in Conway, but even there, the projection \u2014 cresting at 14 feet \u2014 is significantly less than the 21-feet record set there last year during Florence.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t control the weather, can only control how to respond to it,\u201d Bell said. \u201cHopefully this storm was a good wake up call to everyone to prepare for what could come next.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reis Thebault\n\nCarolinas hit by winds, power outages as officials warn of potential flash floods\n\nHurricane winds began picking up, rain resumed its day-long drenching and flash flood warnings erupted in downtown Wilmington, N.C., on Thursday night.\n\nBy 8 p.m., Duke Energy reported more than 29,000 customers without power in coastal North Carolina, extending into northeastern South Carolina.\n\nThe Wilmington forecast office of the National Weather Service said several confirmed tornadoes have been reported Thursday in North and South Carolina coastal counties, seven to 12 inches of rain has drenched coastal South Carolina, and six to eight inches of rain has fallen in Wilmington\u2019s New Hanover County and the adjoining Pender County. An additional three to six inches are possible overnight.\n\n\u201cFlash flooding and power outages are the main concerns, with the tornado threat now gone,\u201d the service bulletin said. \u201cStorm surge is also still a concern through tonight\u2019s high tide, especially for North Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe high tide at Wrightsville Beach, directly east of Wilmington, is at 1:27 a.m. Friday, just as hurricane winds are expected to peak.\n\n\u2014 Patricia Sullivan\n\nBahamas death toll rises to 30\n\nThe hurricane left at least 30 people dead in the Bahamas, the country\u2019s health minister, Duane Sands, said Thursday.\n\n\u2014 Jasper Ward\n\nFlorida links six deaths to the storm, mostly people who died while preparing\n\nAuthorities in Florida linked six deaths in the state to Hurricane Dorian, which churned alongside the state\u2019s eastern coast on its way north.\n\nThe deaths officially listed as related to Dorian all appeared to involve people preparing for the storm or dying after being evacuated before its arrival.\n\nJason Mahon, a spokesman for the Florida division of emergency management, said Thursday that six deaths in the state were \u201cconfirmed by the medical examiner as related to the hurricane.\"\n\nAccording to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, medical examiners said that as of Thursday, the six deaths took place in four counties \u2014 Collier, Brevard, Orange and Osceola \u2014 in the southern and central parts of the state. They occurred between Saturday and Wednesday.\n\nThey were mostly people who died preparing for the storm, including a 38-year-old man electrocuted while trimming trees to prevent outages before the storm; a 68-year-old trying to install window shutters when he fell; a 72-year-old man who collapsed while moving luggage during the evacuation; and a 56-year-old man cutting branches before the storm when he fell. In addition, an 86-year-old man who had been evacuated and was staying in a shelter became unresponsive and later died, officials said.\n\n\u2014 Lori Rozsa\n\nNorth Carolina governor: \u2018We have a long night ahead of us'\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) pleaded with residents to remain home while the state is lashed by Hurricane Dorian.\n\n\u201cWe are feeling the storm\u2019s force, but it has only started,\u201d Cooper said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe have a long night ahead of us.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cooper\u2019s office, major river flooding was forecast in parts of the state and flash floods were a concern in the eastern part of North Carolina.\n\nIn Hanover County, his office said, some areas got 9 inches of rain Thursday, closing more than a dozen roads because of downed trees and flooding. Eight tornadoes were also reported from Wayne to New Hanover counties, his office added, saying they caused structural damage but no reported injuries or deaths.\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\nMore rain and fears of flooding in S.C.\n\nMYRTLE BEACH, S.C. \u2014 By Thursday afternoon, Dorian was 60 miles from Myrtle Beach. As it crept slowly up the coast, its rain bands and wind were already buffeting the beaches, hours after at least two tornadoes had spun off the hurricane and touched down in North Myrtle Beach.\n\nBut as of 3 p.m., emergency management officials were projecting that the storm would not make landfall on the Grand Strand, the strip of coast line stretching from the North Carolina state line to Georgetown, S.C.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a worst-case scenario, but it hasn\u2019t passed us yet,\u201d said Mark Kruea, the city of Myrtle Beach\u2019s public information officer.\n\nKruea said the area got more rain than they expected, which could lead to more flooding in Myrtle Beach and Conway \u2014 especially when paired with the storm surge, which will likely push the Waccamaw and Little Pee Dee rivers over their banks. But, Kruea said, the severity of the flooding will be \u201cnothing to compare with [Hurricane] Florence at all.\u201d\n\nOn the beach, a stranded Jeep Grand Cherokee, buried up to its wheels in sand, caught the attention of local and social media for several hours Thursday morning and afternoon. Authorities said they weren\u2019t sure how it got there and didn\u2019t have plans to move it before the storm rolled in.\n\nAs winds intensified, thousands of people in the Myrtle Beach area had lost power \u2014 including, at one point, the entire city of Georgetown.\n\n\u2014 Reis Thebault\n\n\u2018You never know\u2019 what will happen\n\nEMERALD ISLE, N.C. \u2014 Some residents surveying the tornado damage said they weren\u2019t rethinking their decision to stay put, in part because they thought Dorian would pale in comparison with Florence which hung around the Carolinas like Dorian hung around the Bahamas.\n\nSam Shipp moved back into his Emerald Isle house just eight days ago after it was ravaged by Hurricane Florence. The rental house he was staying in with his wife and two adolescent children was sold.\n\n\u201cWe thought we have to go back, no big deal, and then we get faced with this,\u201d said Shipp, who is friends with the owner of the water park where roofers were at work on a building Tuesday afternoon.\n\nBut the memories of Florence and the fresh evidence of Dorian\u2019s dangers before him wasn\u2019t enough to convince him to evacuate, he said, because it looked like the storm wouldn\u2019t linger. He said neighbors and friends decided Thursday morning to flee inland as it looked like Dorian wouldn\u2019t drift east.\n\n\u201cWe are kind of right in the bull\u2019s eye, and that\u2019s what changed people\u2019s mind,\u201d said Shipp, who is in his 50s. \u201cYou always will second-guess ourselves. You never know.\u201d\n\n[Satellite images show the destruction of Dorian in the Bahamas]\n\nHeather Palmeter, 55, lives on a hill about a mile from the tornado site and rode her bike to film the damage on her phone.\n\nA waterside hotel where she tends bar was untouched with nearby palm trees standing firm, just a block away from overturned trailers and debris.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of freaked out right now, and the storm hasn\u2019t even gotten here yet,\u201d said Palmeter, a school counselor who moved from Reston, Va. in 2017 and said she still prefers hurricanes to Beltway traffic. She planned to stay home. \u201cWe can hide in a cinder block garage, and we are up a hill and safe from the water and safe from the wind,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as no tornadoes come through, I think we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Fenit Nirappil\n\nHeavy rainfall with Hurricane Dorian. pic.twitter.com/xvucVZhZDs \u2014 NWS Wilmington NC (@NWSWilmingtonNC) September 5, 2019\n\nHeading into shelters not knowing what would be waiting at home\n\nMYRTLE BEACH, S.C. \u2014 On Monday morning, Peter McLaughlin got a knock on his door at the Blue Water Resort, where he lives feet from the beach. The hotel was shutting down ahead of the storm, and he\u2019d have to find another place to stay.\n\nMcLaughlin was one of the first to arrive at Conway High School, where the Red Cross had set up a shelter. Thursday was his fourth day there, and more people were beginning to trickle in. The 56-year-old moved to the area in the mid-1990s with the Air Force, but he said this year feels historic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than I thought it\u2019d be,\u201d he said of the hurricane. \u201cThis one is much closer to us than any I\u2019ve ever seen. It appears to be making a beeline for Myrtle Beach.\u201d\n\nLucinda Stutts, who arrived at the shelter Thursday morning, said it feels worse than Hurricane Florence in 2018. Her biggest concern, she said, is the wind and what it might do to the towering pine trees near her home in Conway.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to go back to,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014 Reis Thebault\n\nPictures from NOAA buoy 41004 located about 40 miles southeast of Charleston taken at 12:10 pm this afternoon when the buoy was in the eye of Hurricane Dorian.

Even before the eye of Dorian made its way to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, one of those tornadoes wreaked havoc on tiny Emerald Isle on Thursday morning.\n\nSeveral buildings and businesses were ripped apart as a tornado briefly slashed across a small water park and a park where people stored mobile homes, sending debris flying across the highway. No injuries were reported.\n\nCarol Hodge, 52, stood over what remained of her recreational vehicle, the smoke detector beeping from inside the rubble. She had hoped it would be the first home she could call her own after living in a parent\u2019s house and with friends. She wasn\u2019t worried at first when she heard about the tornado, figuring it must have been closer to the water.\n\nI\u2019m in Emerald Isle, N.C. where a tornado this morning struck a park where people stored mobile homes. Carol Hodge lost the RV that she hoped would be the first home she could call her own. She recognized her couch on the street from local TV footage #HurricaneDorian pic.twitter.com/wK6dklNaz1 \u2014 Fenit Nirappil (@FenitN) September 5, 2019\n\nThen she saw some footage on local television, and recognized her \u201clittle ugly\u201d green couch lying in the middle of the street. She rushed to the island.\n\n\u201cThis was going to be the first time I ever lived in my own place, but maybe it wasn\u2019t meant to be,\u201d said Hodge, a lifelong North Carolina resident who planned to ride out the storm in a mobile home community in nearby Swansboro. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be able to do now.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, she just was trying to salvage what she could before the downpours started. A bar stool. Shower curtain rods. She smiled at the overturned bath tub with a pained look.\n\n\u201cI was really looking forward to having a tub,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cNormally campers only let you have showers.\u201d\n\nShe was staid as she shared her story with others who came to survey the damage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably hit me later tonight when I sit and really think about it,\u201d Hodge told The Post.\n\n\u2014 Fenit Nirappil\n\nPolice arrest some in N.C. for not heeding evacuation orders\n\nWILMINGTON, N.C. \u2014 A \u201cfew\u201d stragglers in the small city of Wrightsville Beach were arrested early Thursday and criminally charged with failing to heed evacuation warnings, police chief Dan House announced, but he would not say how many were arrested or identify them.\n\n\u201cOvernight, some individuals who failed to heed evacuation warnings were arrested, and some were criminally charged,\u201d he said at a late morning news briefing. \u201cWe have consulted the D.A., and he has agreed to prosecute the cases.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances are unclear. He said the charges are misdemeanors, but he said he did not know how many people were charged. House said in response to questions that his force would not arrest anyone if they are trying to evacuate although police would follow them to make sure they leave.\n\nAbout 2,500 people live on the island full time, and on an average day, another 7,500 visitors and part-time residents are there. The city has been under a mandatory evacuation order since Wednesday morning.\n\n\u2014 Patricia Sullivan\n\n[The wild horses that will ride out the hurricane on the Outer Banks]\n\n\u2018This is the worst I\u00b4ve seen in the Bahamas by far\u2019\n\nMIAMI BEACH \u2014 On Thursday morning in Miami, U.S. Coast Guard sailors formed a human chain to load pallets of bottled water and boxes of woven plastic tarps to ship to the Bahamas.\n\nCoast Guard 7th District Commander Rear Admiral Eric Jones said Thursday morning in Miami Beach that the Bahamian government, with help from U.S., British and other forces, is still dispatching helicopters to assess which communities on the Grand Bahamas and Abacos islands remain cut off from aid by washed-out roads.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen both communities that are completely isolated and [with] very little sense of what\u2019s going on the ground, and others like Freeport where the community is already standing up and getting the hospital back up and running on their own,\u201d Jones said.\n\nBecause the storm surge flooded so many communities, with jagged debris submerged underneath, officials cannot easily land helicopters or navigate to local ports to deliver food and water.\n\n\u201cPhysically there\u2019s just roads that aren\u2019t there any more,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis is the worst I\u2019ve seen in the Bahamas by far.\u201d\n\nOfficials said they are still urgently searching for survivors, but operations are shifting from plucking people from flooded rooftops to ferrying more seriously injured patients to higher-level hospitals, and delivering food and water to survivors to prevent dehydration in the searing heat.\n\nJo-Ann Burdian, the Coast Guard\u2019s captain of the port of Miami, told the cutters heading out Thursday that they were facing many unknowns, even for people experienced with the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cDorian has rewritten the nautical charts for the Bahamas,\u201d in particular for Abacos and the Grand Bahama Island, she said. \u201cSo exercise caution,\u201d Burdian said Thursday morning on the Paul Clark, one of the 154-foot cutters preparing to head to the Bahamas.\n\nBesides the floodwaters, another logistical challenge for the Coast Guard is ensuring that the Bahamian government and nonprofit agencies are prepared to receive and distribute tarps, water and other goods on the ground. Many people want to help in the aftermath of a horrific storm, officials said, but the process can go awry if it isn\u2019t orderly. James Passarelli, Coast Guard chief of staff in the 7th District, said officials want to avoid \u201ca black market situation or anything like that can go bad when you just dump a bunch of supplies into a devastated area.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Maria Sacchetti\n\nDorian threatens \u2018widespread\u2019 flash flooding in eastern Carolinas\n\nHurricane Dorian\u2019s eye should be near or over the coasts of eastern South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina during the next 12 to 24 hours, the National Hurricane Center reported Thursday morning. As it moves along these coasts, the hurricane center said, Dorian is forecast to get weaker.\n\nRegardless of where the storm\u2019s center goes, \u201clife-threatening storm surge and dangerous winds are expected\u201d along parts of the Carolina coast and some parts farther north, the hurricane center said.\n\n\u201cFlash flooding will become more widespread across the eastern Carolinas and far southeast Virginia today into tonight,\u201d the hurricane center warned. \u201cThere is a high risk of flash flooding over these areas, where significant, life-threatening, flash flooding is expected.\u201d\n\nThe Capital Weather Gang reported Thursday morning that Dorian\u2019s winds have decreased slightly since the morning, but noted that there was little difference between a low-end Category 3 storm and a high-end Category 2 storm. Dorian was located 50 miles southeast of Charleston, S.C., as of around of 11 a.m., they reported.\n\n\u2014 Mark Berman\n\n\n\nTwo men board up a house before the arrival of Hurricane Dorian on Wednesday in Kure Beach, N.C..

By midmorning, large swaths of Horry County were under both tornado and flash flood warnings as Dorian moved up the coast.\n\nIn North Myrtle Beach, real estate agent Wayne White was checking on some of his properties, when he noticed what appeared to be clouds starting to swirl ahead of him. He began recording and pulled his car over.\n\nAs of 9:30 a.m., one or more tornadoes had damaged several residential buildings and mobile homes in North Myrtle Beach, a city spokesman, Patrick Dowling, told The Washington Post. No one was injured, he said, but some residents were evacuated to shelters.\n\nLocal emergency management officials said the number of potential tornadoes was surprising, and they had expected them to come more sporadically. Dowling said the hurricane\u2019s strong winds are also preventing the tide from receding entirely, blocking storm water from exiting into the ocean.\n\n\u201cThe next high tide,\u201d he said, which will be around 1:30 p.m., \u201cwill further exacerbate the problem.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reis Thebault\n\n[Hurricane Dorian is spinning up a slew of tornadoes.

C.\u2014 A triple blow of devastating hurricanes \u2014 Matthew in 2016, Florence in September 2018, and Michael weeks later \u2014 has had a profound impact on the thinking here. The debate is no longer about \u201cif\u201d another megastorm will come but \u201cwhen.\u201d\n\nAs a result, state leaders are attempting to shift their approach to extreme weather from reactive to proactive. Among the new strategies is an effort to buy out homeowners in neighborhoods that have been struck multiple times and move them to safer locations. The state recently established an Office of Recovery and Resiliency in part to halt the cycle of destruction and rebuilding, identifying less-vulnerable locations to move people such as Teresa Seal and her neighbors before they have to be rescued by boat.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Kirk Ross and Frances Stead Sellers\n\nAwaiting Dorian with memories of Hurricane Florence\u2019s flooding\n\nNEW BERN, N. C.\u2014 Residents in this storm-weary city are putting sandbags around homes and businesses, moving vehicles to high ground, and keeping a close eye on the track of Hurricane Dorian, which is expected to drive waters from Pamilco Sound up the Neuse River.\n\nThe expectations are for a storm not as dire as last year\u2019s Hurricane Florence, which delivered a devastating combination of high storm surge and heavy upstream rainfall to the confluence of the Neuse and Trent rivers next to New Bern\u2019s historic downtown.\n\nStanley Kite, director of Emergency Services for Craven County, said four shelters have been open in the county with about 65 residents checking in as of midnight Wednesday. Residents with medical needs seeking refuge were taken to a large state-run shelter farther inland, while a voluntary evacuation is in effect for anyone living in the 100-year flood plain.\n\n\u201cThis storm is still a good ways off,\u201d Kite said. \u201cIt could change in intensity, it could change in direction.\u201d\n\nThe forecast calls for a storm surge of four to six feet. That could easily rise, but likely not to levels Craven County saw during Florence when a 12-foot storm surge flooded the bottom floor of the county courthouse in New Bern, where Kite and his team are based. Kite expects a lot of debris, downed trees and limbs, as well as some storm surge flooding, and damage from wind-driven rain.\n\nMemories of Florence are still vivid here, and the damage is still evident, especially in low-lying neighborhoods where many residents are still living in RVs next to their flooded homes.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019re keeping in mind is that we still have a lot of damaged structures from Florence. We still have a lot of tarps on roofs,\u201d Kite said. \u201cI really hate it for those individuals because they\u2019re definitely going to get hit again.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Kirk Ross\n\nWind, rain and power outages in S.C.\n\nBLUFFTON, S.C.-- Residents of the Hilton Head Island area are still experiencing rain and wind after Dorian\u2019s eye passed by the coast overnight. Winds reaching a little more than 60 miles per hour were recorded in Hilton Head Island, S.C., and Tybee Island, Ga., overnight.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) lifted the mandatory evacuation orders for Chatham County, where Savannah is located, at about 10:30 Thursday morning. He also lifted evacuations for Bryan, Camden, Glynn, Liberty and McIntosh counties, encompassing the Georgia coast.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster (R) has left the evacuation in effect.\n\nResidents of Beaufort County, S.C., have reported power outages and some downed trees. Dominion Energy, formerly South Carolina Gas & Electric, reported having 153,022 customers without power in the state at 10:30 a.m. Thursday.

One street over, Laura and Bob McCantes, 66 and 67, moved into their new home Saturday from the North Carolina mountain town of Blowing Rock.\n\n\u201cWe are 50 feet above the [cape Fear] river here, so I\u2019m not too worried,\u201d said Laura McCantes. \u201cBut the last time we moved it was right before Hugo, and we moved right where it made landfall.
