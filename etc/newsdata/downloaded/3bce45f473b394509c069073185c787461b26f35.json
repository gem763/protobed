But they also share the power to inspire, and recently, they\u2019ve had the chance to overlap.\n\nThe documentary Disruptor Conductor shows Symphony Nova Scotia\u2019s journey to create the first orchestral drag show in Canada. The two main figures behind this crossover \u2014 conductor Daniel Bartholomew-Poyser and drag star Thorgy Thor \u2014 hosted two sold-out shows in Halifax.\n\nThe unprecedented event brought together multiple generations during the city\u2019s 2018 Pride celebrations \u2014 young and old, and across the rainbow.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s make this a show\u2019\n\nFor Thor, who is classically trained on the violin, viola and cello, combining drag with a professional orchestral performance was a pivotal moment. Earlier in her life, as she recounts in Disruptor Conductor, \u201cI had to choose drag or music.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery one of the orchestra players I went to conservatory with, or professionally played with, they were always very content with: You practice four hours a day, you take auditions and then when you get a spot and a seat in an orchestra \u2014 that\u2019s what your job is now,\u201d Thor explained in an interview with the documentary\u2019s producers.\n\n\u201cI was never content with that. Ever.\u201d\n\nThor considers herself a performance artist. While orchestras required unity and conformity \u2014 \u201clike we\u2019re soldiers,\u201d she said \u2014 she would find herself daydreaming amid the masterpieces.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of playing some Tchaikovsky piece, I would close my eyes and think, \u2018You know what would be great during this? This kind of prop design and the lighting should be like this, and I see one figure coming out like this with a spotlight, and the concept should be this,\u2019\u201d Thor said.\n\n\u201cMy mind always went further, rather than [just] playing the notes on a page. I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s make this a show!\u2019\u201d\n\nAn instant hit\n\nOver the years, Thor fell in love with drag, worked in the scene and eventually found fame on two seasons of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. \u201cI just love characters because it\u2019s about theatre to me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about entertainment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think drag is for everyone \u2014 drag art, or dressing up and doing ideas. It\u2019s not for everybody. I always felt like it was for me because I could never shut it off.\u201d\n\nThor\u2019s violin made occasional appearances in her performances, and her classical background became part of her persona. That information made its way to Symphony Nova Scotia, and conductor Bartholomew-Poyser \u2014 who is also the symphony\u2019s artist in residence and community ambassador \u2014 reached out to Thor about a potential collaboration.\n\nBartholomew-Poyser describes his enthusiasm for the idea.\n\nThe concept was an instant hit in the community.\n\n\u201cI [lived] with two selves, and one of them was a very strict, classical-trained, focused nerd,\u201d Thor said. \u201cAnd the other one was an outlandish clown, dressed-in-a-red-wig nerd. So [I thought,] let\u2019s bring our two nerd selves together. And I can\u2019t believe we literally sold out 1,000 seats in five hours! In one city!\u201d\n\nOpening the doors\n\nThe \u201cThorgy and the Thorchestra\u201d show has taken off since the Halifax concerts. Performances popped up in other Canadian cities and most recently landed in New York\u2019s Gramercy Theatre at the end of August.\n\nIn her interview, before the show\u2019s travelling success, Thor mused on the significance of the event for the LGBTQ community and her role in pushing boundaries \u2014 while bringing people together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that I\u2019m a revolutionary and a genius,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just having fun and doing two things that I have worked many, many years to perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I do stop to think about what I\u2019m doing, I am opening up the doors to a younger generation of artists,\u201d she said. Her advice to them? \u201cKeep going, learn another craft and then put them all together, and make a new show. I did it, and it\u2019s great!\u201d\n\nFighting for acceptance\n\nDrag is outrageous, playful and high-energy fun. But it\u2019s also a job. Thor bounces between gigs, events, shows and endorsements in a competitive world. The art of drag is evolving, and a new generation is making waves on social media.\n\nBringing the classical community \u2014 usually viewed as having an older, more traditional audience \u2014 together with the LGBTQ world was a meaningful highlight in her career.\n\n\u201cI actually have to remind myself to take a second and remind myself what I\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d Thor said. \u201cBecause I never stop working.\u201d\n\nShe realizes that each time a boundary is nudged back, there\u2019s more room for people to express who they are. The LGBTQ community has been fighting for freedom and acceptance for generations.\n\n\u201cI want to play with every orchestra across the world and just do this because I think it\u2019s really magnificent,\u201d Thor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nWatch Disruptor Conductor.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nina Dragicevic"], "top_image": ""}
