During the interview she made a rather shocking admission: Hunter Biden received permission from the Obama White House to sit on the Ukrainian oil company's board of directors. Remember: Hunter was being paid $50,000 a month even though he had no natural energy experience and his father was working on foreign relations with Ukraine at the time.\n\n\u201cThere were unfounded claims against him. For example, in this Washington Post report he writes, and we read it, he talks about \u2018He will not go after my family, he will not take down my family or destroy my family. But he doesn\u2019t get explicit about Hunter himself. Why is that, Kate?\u201d host Hallie Jackson asked.\n\n\"He has. He\u2019s been asked and he said, \u2018Look, every single independent outlet that\u2019s looked into this has said there was no issue of wrongdoing here.\u2019 And you know in 2014 the White House cleared Hunter serving on that board,\" Bedingfield said. \"So he has absolutely been asked that question and he\u2019s answered it many times.\"\n\nAccording to Bedingfield, the Biden campaign refuses to \"play by Donald Trump's rule book.\" She said she anticipates Trump trying \"to change the subject and we\u2019re not going to let them do that. We\u2019re not going to let them do that. We\u2019re going to hold them accountable and we will remind voters what kind of administration Donald Trump is running.\u201d\n\nBedingfield's statement runs contradictory to what Biden has previously said. He previously said he never spoke of business dealings with his son. If Hunter received permission to serve on the board of directors, how did this not come up in conversation between the father and son pair?\n\n\n\n", "description": "Bombshell..10/07/2019 19:30:17PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Sarah Lee"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/276/8be9d20b-6f41-4341-8dc9-4312049fbc0f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
