He can liken it to the \u201cBin Laden\u201d moment of the Obama administration, when the U.S. killed the jihadist who planned the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n\nBut killing Baghdadi is not without risk. While IS has suffered a blow, it had already decentralized some structures and proved capable of attacks as far away as Africa, Asia and Europe. His death may rally supporters. Much depends on who, if anyone, replaces him.\n\nThe Turkish offensive inside Syria has also seen Kurds abandon prisons where they held IS fighters. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many escaped, and to where.\n\nTrump may want out of what he sees as other peoples\u2019 messy wars. But it\u2019s too soon to say if Islamic State will oblige him.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nAnother extension | The European Union this morning granted the U.K. a delay to Brexit until Jan. 31. In London, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pushing for a vote in the House of Commons this afternoon to trigger an early general election, saying it\u2019s the only way to resolve the deadlock that has stopped the U.K. ratifying an exit deal.Full steam ahead | House Democrats are moving closer to impeaching Trump even after his battlefield victory. History suggests Trump may enjoy a boost in public support after the raid, but it will likely be short-lived. That gives Democrats little incentive to slow down. The inquiry resumes today with testimony from Charles Kupperman, a former deputy national security adviser.\n\nThe New York City lawmaker whose district includes much of Manhattan and Trump Tower has the inside track to take over a committee with a leading role in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPeronism returns | Alberto Fernandez won Argentina\u2019s presidential vote yesterday, defeating pro-market incumbent Mauricio Macri and tilting the nation back to left-wing populism. While voters rejected the austerity of Macri\u2019s government, the outcome was closer than expected, reflecting concern about Fernandez\u2019s ability to steer the economy out of a protracted slump.\n\nRead here how the central bank immediately tightened capital controls further. Fernandez set the stage for a first diplomatic tiff with his call for Brazil\u2019s Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva to be freed.\n\nAngry Europeans | For all the relief that populists failed to make a breakthrough in this year\u2019s European elections, mainstream parties are still under pressure. The latest reminder came yesterday when Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats slumped in a state election from first to third \u2014 behind the far-right nationalist Alternative for Germany \u2014 and the Italian coalition was hammered by the anti-immigrant League in a regional vote.\n\nPower plenum | Chinese Leader Xi Jinping looks set to use a closed-door session of the Central Committee to push his political agenda and tighten the ruling Communist Party\u2019s control over the country of some 1.4 billion people. The meeting, which runs through Thursday, could result in a new leadership beneath Xi as he battles Trump on trade.\n\nWhat to Watch This Week\n\nUruguay\u2019s presidential election will go to a Nov. 24 runoff after none of the candidates reached the 50%-plus-one threshold needed to win in a first round of voting. White House adviser Jared Kushner and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plan to attend Saudi Arabia\u2019s annual investment forum, which Mnuchin skipped last year because of the kingdom\u2019s role in the murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi won a second term by a landslide in the natural-gas-rich nation\u2019s Oct. 15 elections that the main opposition rejected as a \u201cmega fraud.\u201d Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg will testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing examining the safety and the future of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max jetliner.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for the\u00a0Balance of Power\u00a0newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for more.The U.S. killing of Islamic State\u2019s feared chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in northern Syria is a timely result for Donald Trump.He\u2019", "authors": ["Rosalind Mathieson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5HhMYQFm7CcrqB8Oipkpjg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/05190c4e69beb45dd60a589045aee69d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
