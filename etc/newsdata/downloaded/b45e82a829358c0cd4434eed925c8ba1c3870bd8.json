The author offers not a hint of irony in this lovely snapshot of the good life in Pyongyang. The reader has no idea if the author is a sincere apologist for the evil regime or if the author was not allowed \u2014 or simply feared \u2014 publishing something without a word of morally serious criticism for one of the worst police states in the history of the world. No mention whether the packed restaurants are only for the party elites who have access to hard currency \u2014 or really wealth of any kind. The only real hint that things aren\u2019t totally swell in the Democratic Peoples\u2019 Republic was this tidbit about how he can\u2019t stay in touch with his former roommate.\n\nNow that he\u2019s moved out of the dorm I\u2019m unable to contact him again \u2014 foreigners\u2019 phone numbers are on a separate network and meeting locals without an express reason is generally frowned upon. Saying goodbye was emotional.\n\nI\u2019ll bet. We\u2019ll find out later if his roommate is in a labor camp.", "description": "An Australian grad student in North Korea\u00a0pens a little travelogue\u00a0for the Guardian.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
