(Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHe is the richest man in Asia, an industrialist who built an energy giant, launched a nationwide telecom network and lives in his very own skyscraper.\n\nBut Mukesh Ambani\u2019s next gambit may be his most audacious yet \u2014 and it will put him on a collision course with Amazon and Walmart in the battle to dominate e-commerce as hundreds of millions of Indians begin shopping online.\n\nDigital purchases are growing rapidly in India and could hit $200 billion in the next seven years, according to a recent report by Deloitte. Unlike China, where homegrown players like Alibaba have cornered the e-commerce market, the future of online shopping in India remains up for grabs.\n\nEnter Ambani. His Reliance Industries is India\u2019s largest company, an oil-to-entertainment conglomerate that is evolving into a firm focused on Indian consumers. Three years ago, Ambani started a telecom network whose cut-rate, data-heavy plans revolutionized the Indian Internet.\n\nAmbani is hoping to achieve something similarly disruptive in e-commerce. Reliance aims to \u201ccompletely transform\u201d the millions of individual merchants and modest shops that still make up about 90 percent of the country\u2019s retail market, Ambani told investors last month. He pledged to turn even the smallest mom-and-pop shop into a \u201cfuture-ready digitized store.\u201d\n\n\n\nMukesh Ambani, right, appears with his wife, Nita Ambani, center, and mother, Kokilaben Ambani.

For the past three months, as part of a pilot project, he has used a Reliance-provided device that can swipe credit and debit cards, manage inventory, process rebates and accept inventory orders. The company also told him it is planning to open a large warehouse nearby that can deliver supplies to him within hours.\n\nA Reliance spokesman declined to respond to questions about the firm\u2019s e-commerce strategy, and company executives turned down interview requests. Aside from Ambani\u2019s brief remarks at the company\u2019s annual meeting, Reliance has been tight-lipped about its e-commerce plans.\n\nIn the absence of verified information, rumors have flourished, including that Reliance is planning some kind of high-profile launch around Diwali, a major festival that will take place this year in October (for Indian retailers, Diwali is the equivalent of the Christmas shopping season in the United States). Reliance declined to say if any kind of launch is planned for later this year.\n\nAmazon and Walmart are watching closely. Analysts say that India, home to more than 1.3 billion people, is a crucial market for both firms. Incomes are rising, smartphone usage is spreading and the shift toward large-scale, organized retailing has only begun.\n\nLast year, Walmart invested $16 billion \u2014 its largest purchase ever \u2014 to acquire Flipkart, a leading Indian e-commerce platform. Amazon has committed more than $5 billion to its Indian operations and recently announced a deal to buy a small indirect stake in Future Retail, one of India\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailers. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s early days for e-commerce in India with several companies pursuing different strategies, and this competition is good for customers,\u201d said an Amazon spokeswoman in response to questions about Reliance\u2019s push into online shopping.\n\nWalmart echoed the sentiment. \u201cIndia is a big market and there should be opportunity for many retailers to grow in the years to come,\u201d a company spokeswoman said.\n\nAmazon and Walmart \u201chave to take Reliance extremely seriously,\u201d said Abneesh Roy, a retail analyst at Edelweiss Securities in Mumbai. Reliance is \u201cone of the top two players wherever they have entered. They understand the Indian consumer and they understand Indian regulations.\u201d\n\nLately Ambani, 62, has struck an explicitly nationalist tone in public. He has called data \u201cthe new oil\u201d and warned that global corporations should not control Indians\u2019 information. \u201cData colonization is as bad as previous forms of colonization,\u201d he said late last year.\n\nSuch views mesh well with the outlook of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government, which dislikes the idea of foreign companies dominating Indian e-commerce. An abrupt rule change earlier this year forced Amazon to restructure the way it did business in India. A draft version of a new government policy for e-commerce sounded a cautionary note about the \u201chandful of companies\u201d that \u201cdominate the digital economy.\u201d\n\nReliance\u2019s potential competitors say there is room for multiple players. E-commerce in India is \u201clike a galaxy expanding,\u201d said an Indian executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. \u201cEveryone has a role to play, we just want to make sure it\u2019s equal treatment.\u201d\n\nReliance is doing a \u201cfabulous job of keeping everyone guessing,\u201d said another industry executive who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. The biggest concern is \u201ctheir potential to intervene in regulatory matters.\u201d\n\nReliance, which was founded by Ambani\u2019s father Dhirubhai, has a reputation for influencing policy in its favor. \u201cThe speed dial facility which they have is a unique one,\u201d said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak, referring to Reliance\u2019s ability to reach into the highest levels of Indian politics and policymaking. That still represents \u201ca big advantage.\u201d\n\nIn the near term, Reliance, Amazon and Walmart all must contend with a slowing Indian economy. But Reliance has considerable assets over the long run, Singhal said. It is already a major offline retailer, with chains of clothing stores, groceries and gas stations. It has its own telecom network with more than 340 million customers. It also owns television channels and has announced a joint venture to produce movies.\n\nThanks to the spread of smartphone usage in India, there is a \u201chuge undercurrent\u201d of young users that will translate into an explosion in online shopping for goods and services within a few years, Singhal said. \u201cThere is only one company that is completely ready for that and that is Reliance,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now at least, Reliance\u2019s ambition to transform small traders into the foot soldiers of its e-commerce empire looks more tentative than revolutionary. On a recent morning, not far from the blue and green glass towers of Reliance\u2019s corporate office park in Navi Mumbai, a bustling market street was open for business in a monsoon downpour.\n\nAt Gayatri General Stores, Bhavesh Patel, 44, and his son Yash, 23, stood at their decade-old business, a small general store selling snacks, dry goods and toiletries. Strips of plastic sachets of shampoo dangled from the ceiling.\n\n\n\nReliance Industries has promised to transform India\u2019s millions of mom-and-pop stores through the use of point-of-sale devices like this one. (Joanna Slater/The Washington Post)\n\nA few months ago, a Reliance representative offered Patel a free point-of-sale device (there was a $40 deposit, but no transaction charges). It was the first time the shop has ever accepted card payments. For now, however, the proprietors only use it for that limited purpose.\n\nNearby, several other mom-and-pop shops \u2014 a ubiquitous feature of Indian retailing known as kirana stores, which often sell rice, grains, oils and packaged foods \u2014 were also trying out the Reliance devices, which look like large cellphones mounted on a base.\n\nThe only one to use the device for anything beyond card payments was Sonu Singh, who opened his own small drugstore a little over a year ago. Singh says Reliance sends discount codes to its cellphone customers via an app, which he can then scan to complete the promotion, boosting sales and obtaining a small rebate. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s good, no?\u201d he said with a smile. Then he turned back to the counter, where the next customer was waiting.\n\nPayal Mohta contributed reporting.\n\nRead more\n\nInternational pushback disrupts Amazon\u2019s momentum to expand its empire worldwide\n\nIndia\u2019s railroads had 63,000 job openings. 19 million people applied.\n\nIndia\u2019s economic growth stumbles to 6-year low, deepening worries over future\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "A three-way race is underway to dominate one of the last major frontiers in e-commerce.", "authors": ["Joanna Slater", "Foreign Correspondent Covering South Asia", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZLdI-1DFZ2odCgTj6r08XHJV7KY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RPPZHJGKTQI6TIP6ZJDORVLTYA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
