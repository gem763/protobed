Then you can learn and build up nicely, but at a certain point it also became more difficult for him, because we were very close together the whole time.\n\n\u201cIn the end this (rivalry) is also very important for the team. You also want someone who works in the same direction in terms of set up and wants the same things from the car. Then you can also develop the car much better.\n\n\u201cThen you can put the cars on different programs on a Friday, if you can rely on both drivers to get the right information. These things are very important for me, but also for the team.\u201d\n\nThe admission does fly in the face of an interview Verstappen did with Ziggo Sport where he said of Ricciardo, \u201cI do not think Daniel would have made a large contribution\u201d as the team develops the RB15 car.\n\nThe pair appeared to have a fiery relationship in 2018, evidenced by their crash at Baku in Azerbaijan.\n\nThey have appeared to mellow this season, even combining for a hilarious double act at the Singapore Grand Prix.\n\nSimilarly, Ricciardo doesn\u2019t appear to miss his role at Red Bull, sending a pointed barb at his former team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to picture myself at Red Bull this year and look at the potential results I could have had, but I don\u2019t feel I would be feeling any different to what I felt last year,\u201d he told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I would have progressed. Max has won a couple of races, but they haven\u2019t done anything more than they did when I was there.\n\n\u201cI would have maybe stood on the podium a few times, but I\u2019ve done that before, and ultimately it\u2019s not getting everything that I want (out of F1). Knowing what Red Bull should be capable of, I don\u2019t feel it would be fulfilling for me.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the F1 website about the move to Renault, Ricciardo said his current situation with the team \u201cfeels right\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy no means was it an easy decision,\u201d he said last year of the move. \u201cI guess I got to a point where I felt I was ready for a change. I was ready for a new challenge and I think just for me personally I needed some fresh motivation.\n\n\u201cI had a few sleepless nights, for sure, trying to come up with the best conclusion for my future but once I made that decision and pulled the trigger, I felt comfortable with it and it feels right.\u201d", "description": "When Daniel Ricciardo dropped the bombshell that he was leaving Red Bull, it sent shockwaves through the F1 world.", "authors": ["Andrew Mcmurtry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ecf41dc8d11fdca13c12f5dc041ddc9b?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
