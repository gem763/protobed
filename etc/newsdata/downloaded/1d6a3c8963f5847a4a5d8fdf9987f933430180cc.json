Many of these Marines have now left the Trump White House amid numerous reports of disagreements or criticisms of Trump.\n\nThe photo above, taken in 2013, marked the first time six four-star Marines Corps generals were actively serving in the Marines.\n\nJim Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, announced his resignation on Thursday and was expected to leave by February. On Sunday, his departure was accelerated to January 1 after Trump announced his acting replacement, Patrick Shanahan, was set to take over. Mattis was a four-star general who led the US Central Command and was celebrated as a top choice to lead the world's most powerful military. He cited disagreements with Trump's policies as the reason for his decision to resign from the Defense Department.\n\nJohn Kelly , the former White House chief of staff, was a four-star Marine Corps general who once led the US Southern Command. He served as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security before being selected by Trump as his chief of staff. Kelly had been expected to bring order to a chaotic West Wing. But he faced headwinds and sometimes clashed with Trump on a number of issues.\n\n, the former White House chief of staff, was a four-star Marine Corps general who once led the US Southern Command.

Joseph Dunford , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, served as the commandant of the Marine Corps and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. His term as the top commander of the US military ends in September 2019. Trump announced US Army chief of staff Gen. Mark Milley as his replacement, despite some reported concerns from Mattis.\n\n, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, served as the commandant of the Marine Corps and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

John Allen, the former commander of the US-led coalition in Afghanistan, did not serve in the Trump administration. Instead, he was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout his campaign and presidency. During a speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2016, Allen endorsed Hillary Clinton and likened Trump's presidency to a \"business transaction\" that conducts \"illegal activities.\" Trump fired back at Allen through a tweet and said his fight against ISIS \"failed badly.\"\n\nThe circumstances of the officers' various exits may vary, but Trump's generals \u2014 service members he spoke of highly throughout his campaign and the early days of his presidency \u2014 have now left an apparent void in the White House.\n\nIn addition to the Marines who will have left the Trump administration, H.R. McMaster, a three-star Army general, was fired as Trump's national security adviser in March. His tenure was marked by numerous reports of disagreements with Trump, who once described him as \"a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience.\"\n\nMcMaster replaced another US Army three-star general as national security adviser, Gen. Michael Flynn, who was fired after it was discovered he lied to the FBI and senior White House officials about his communications with Russian officials.", "description": "President Donald Trump boasted that his administration was staffed by notable service members.", "authors": ["David Choi"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c1c543a0df1763c466ea2e4-2732-1366.jpg"}
