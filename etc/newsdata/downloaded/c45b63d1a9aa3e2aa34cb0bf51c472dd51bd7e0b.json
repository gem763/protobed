Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nJohnson engaged Todd in a heated debate over impeachment efforts and intelligence community abuses. He said former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan corrupted the intelligence agencies they once led, and that he didn't \"trust any of these guys in the Obama administration.\"\n\nSEN. RON JOHNSON: JAMES COMEY, JOHN BRENNAN HAVE CORRUPTED FBI AND CIA\n\nTodd accused the senator of avoiding his question and ignoring the facts, instead opting to attack the media.\n\n\"Senator, I don\u2019t know why you just came on here to personally attack the press and avoid answering questions about what's happened here,\" the host later said.\n\nTrump called Todd's responses \"a total meltdown.\"\n\n\"Seems that a not very bright Chuck just wasn\u2019t getting the answers he was looking for in order to make me look as bad as possible,\" Trump wrote. \"I did NOTHING wrong!\"\n\nTrump last year questioned whether Woodward was a \"Dem operative\" and criticized his book, \"Fear: Trump in the White House,\" saying quotes in the tell-all were \"made-up frauds, a con on the public.\"\n\nThe president went on to tweet about the unemployment rate on Sunday, which the White House said fell to a 50-year low this week.\n\n\"Is that an impeachable event for your President?\" Trump asked.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Nick Givas contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump issued rare compliments to award-winning\u00a0journalist\u00a0Bob Woodward\u00a0while slamming\u00a0\"Face the Nation\" and \"Meet the Press\" hosts on Sunday.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/48842904801_425c2a5fa3_o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
