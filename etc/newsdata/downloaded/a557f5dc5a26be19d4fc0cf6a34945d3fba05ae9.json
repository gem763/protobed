Redfin RDFN, +4.18% computed the downturn risk for the 50 largest cities across the country using the following metrics:\n\n\u2022 Median home sale price-to-household income ratio\n\n\u2022 Average loan-to-value ratio of homes sold in 2018\n\n\u2022 Home price volatility based on the standard deviation of home prices year-to-year\n\n\u2022 Share of home sales that are flips, i.e. sold twice within 12 months for a different price\n\n\u2022 Diversity of local employment based on the likelihood that two randomly selected workers are in the same field\n\n\u2022 Share of the local economy dependent on exports\n\n\u2022 Share of local households headed by someone age 65 or older\n\nThese factors were all weighted differently, based on how likely each attribute was to contribute to a real-estate market downturn, to produce an overall score.\n\nRochester had the lowest score of any city studied at 30.4%, followed by Buffalo, N.Y. (31.9%) and Hartford, Ct. (33.9%). Overall, the top 10 cities that were least likely to see a recession-fueled housing downturn were all located east of the Mississippi River.\n\nRank Metro area Average home loan-to-value ratio Home price volatility Flips share of sales Exports share of GDP Overall score 1 Riverside, Calif. 65.3% 17.9% 6.3% 5.6% 72.8% 2 Phoenix, Ariz. 64.8% 17.7% 8.1% 5.4% 69.8% 3 Miami, Fla. 50.4% 15.2% 7.5% 10.1% 69.5% 4 San Diego, Calif. 65.6% 16.9% 5.9% 8.0% 68.2% 5 Providence, R.I. 70.6% 16.8% 4.4% 8.6% 67.1% 6 Tampa, Fla. 59.2% 17.1% 7.5% 4.3% 66.8% 7 Las Vegas, Nev. 61.0% 16.7% 8.3% 2.4% 64.6% 8 Los Angeles, Calif. 62.6% 15.7% 7.7% 6.1% 63.7% 9 San Antonio, Texas N/A 15.7% 5.8% 7.1% 63.2% 10 Orlando, Fla. 61.2% 16.0% 6.1% 2.4% 59.1%\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Riverside, Calif., has the highest risk of a housing downturn with a score of 72.8%, followed by Phoenix (69.8%) and Miami (69.5%). Most of the high-risk cities were clustered in California and in the Sun Belt, with the exception of Providence, R.I., which ranked as the fifth riskiest city on Redfin\u2019s list.\n\nRead more: Investors could get a great deal on real estate in Opportunity Zones \u2014 and that could be a problem\n\nA number of factors separates cities like Rochester from Riverside. For starters, most of the high-risk cities are located in parts of the country that were hardest hit by the Great Recession. These areas have more volatile home prices than other regions.\n\nA few factors contribute to that volatility, according to Redfin. These markets tend to attract more home flippers looking to turn a major profit. Overall, the higher amount of investor activity in these cities drives home prices up. That forces homeowners to take out larger loans to buy property.\n\nAnd so when recessions hit the local economies of these cities and cause job cuts, the larger loan amounts can represent an even more substantial burden for households that have experienced a loss of income. Many of these home owners will then default on their debt, and the resulting foreclosures will exert downward pressure on home prices across these markets.\n\nAnother factor Redfin considered was each city\u2019s exposure to the export market. Because the upcoming recession would likely be caused by the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, Redin surmised, local economies that are more dependent on global trade could be affected more by the overall economy\u2019s downturn.\n\nThe good news for all home owners across the rest of the country is that the next recession won\u2019t be fueled by the housing market itself, unlike the last one, Redfin\u2019s report concluded.\n\n\u201cHome prices are high right now, but they\u2019re high because there\u2019s not enough supply to meet demand, which means there\u2019s not a bubble at risk of bursting,\u201d Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather said in the report. \u201cMost of today\u2019s financed homeowners have excellent credit and a cushion of home equity, making them unlikely to default on their mortgage.\u201d\n\nThe Great Recession was something of an anomaly in terms of the major impact it had on home prices. Previous recessions produced much smaller changes to home prices \u2014 in the case of the recession sparked by the dot-com bubble, home prices actually rose during that time.", "description": "If investors have flocked to your town, keep a close eye on home prices.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI770_roches_ZG_20190502211346.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
