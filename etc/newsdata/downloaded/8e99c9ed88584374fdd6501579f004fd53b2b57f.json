Ahmed Yusuf, a senior Somali military officer based in Lower Shabelle region.\n\nAl-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaida, have claimed the responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe U.S. military uses the Belidogle airstrip base to launch drones that attack al-Shabab targets and to train Somali troops.\n\n\"This attack, though ineffective, demonstrates the direct threat al-Shabaab poses to Americans, our allies, and interests in the region,\" said Maj. Gen. William Gayler, U.S. Africa Command director of operations, in a statement released later Monday.\n\nThe U.S. Africa Command carried out two airstrikes and used small arms fire to target al-Shabaab fighters fleeing the airstrip, killing an additional 10 rebels and destroying a vehicle, according to the statement.\n\nThe second attack was by a suicide car bomber targeting Italian peacekeepers in Mogadishu. The explosion missed a convoy of the European Union peacekeepers but injured Somali civilians who were nearby, according to reports.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Africa", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
