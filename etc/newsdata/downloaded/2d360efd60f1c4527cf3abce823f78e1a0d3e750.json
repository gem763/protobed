REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe event is the country\u2019s most important of the year as China looks to project its assurance in the face of mounting challenges, including nearly four months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong and a economy-sapping trade war with the United States.\n\nXi, dressed in a slate grey \u201cMao\u201d suit and accompanied by his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, said China will pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up.\n\nThe country\u2019s military should resolutely safeguard China\u2019s sovereignty, security, and development interests, and firmly uphold world peace, Xi told a handpicked crowd at Tiananmen Square, in comments carried live on state television.\n\n\u201cNo force can ever shake the status of China, or stop the Chinese people and nation from marching forward,\u201d Xi said from the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China on this day in 1949.\n\nChina must maintain lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, promote the peaceful development of relations with self-ruled Taiwan and \u201ccontinue to strive for the motherland\u2019s complete reunification\u201d, he added.\n\nXi, whose military modernisation programme has rattled nerves around the region, then descended to the street and inspected row upon row of military hardware and immaculately presented troops.\n\nRiding past in a black limousine, Xi bellowed; \u201cHello comrades, hard-working comrades!\u201d\n\nThe massed ranks of soldiers shouted back: \u201cFollow the Party! Fight to win! Forge exemplary conduct!\u201d\n\nReturning to the stage, Xi reviewed groups of service men and women marching past and lines of tanks, drones and missiles.\n\nAmong the weapons on display were DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles, the backbone of China\u2019s nuclear deterrence capability, which can carry several nuclear warheads and reach as far as the United States.\n\nCAPITAL LOCKED DOWN\n\nXi remains broadly popular in China for his aggressive campaign against corruption and for propelling what is now the world\u2019s second-biggest economy to the forefront of global politics.\n\nBut the Communist Party remains nervous about its grip on power and international standing.\n\nThe capital has been locked down for the parade. Police have told residents whose houses look onto the parade route not to look out their windows.\n\nThere will be a civilian parade too, of students, model workers, ethnic minorities and even a few foreigners, walking alongside or travelling in floats celebrating China\u2019s achievements, officials said last week.\n\nOnce the show is over, 70,000 doves will be released to symbolise peace, according to state media.\n\nIn the evening, fireworks will light up Beijing.\n\nXi faces mounting challenges, notably in Hong Kong, where more large-scale protests are expected on Tuesday. Police there have warned of \u201cvery serious violent attack\u201d.\n\nHong Kong went into lockdown on Tuesday with barricades in the city centre, shuttered stores and a heavy riot police presence. Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is in Beijing for the anniversary celebrations.\n\nAnother challenge is Chinese-claimed Taiwan, a free-wheeling democracy with little interest in being run by Beijing and which holds presidential elections in January.\n\nThere are also restive minorities in Tibet and heavily Muslim Xinjiang, where China has faced international opprobrium for detaining up to one million ethnic Uighurs in what China calls a de-radicalisation scheme.\n\nUnderscoring another problem Xi faces, the parade took place under a smoggy Beijing sky, despite region-wide efforts to curb emissions ahead of the anniversary. Industrial and transportation air pollution has been slow to disperse due to low pressure and high levels of humidity.\n\nOrdinary Chinese residents were not permitted to attend the parade, which was limited to a carefully vetted crowd.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nOn the eastern end of the main road leading into central Beijing, several kilometres (miles) from Tiananmen Square, crowds gathered craning their necks to see anything.\n\nA roadsweeper urged a bystander to go home and watch the parade on television.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t walk to Tiananmen Square. You can\u2019t go further than here,\u201d he said.", "description": "China celebrated its growing power and confidence with a massive display of military hardware and goose-stepping troops in Beijing on Tuesday, overseen by President Xi Jinping who pledged peaceful development on the 70th birthday of Communist China.", "authors": ["Ben Blanchard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435744873&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901U8", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
