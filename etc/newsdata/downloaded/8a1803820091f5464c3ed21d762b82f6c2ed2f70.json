Everyone uses the internet, and odds are that you juggle multiple email accounts on your mobile devices \u2014 one for personal messages, one for work, and possibly more. With so much email in your life, it's likely that you occasionally need to delete all the email on your iPad at once.\n\nUnfortunately, there isn't a \"delete everything\" button anywhere in your iPad's email app. There isn't even a one-tap way to select all your email.\n\nThat's okay, though \u2014 there's a simple workaround that you can use to delete everything.\n\nUnfortunately, even this workaround has its limitations. You can't select all the email on your iPad at once unless you keep everything in your inbox. If you tend to file email into different folders to keep it better organized, you'll need to delete email one folder at a time. It'll still be easy, just a bit slower.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to delete all emails on an iPad using a workaround\n\n1. Open the Mail app.\n\n2. Tap on the folder that you want to empty, such as the inbox or any other folder on your device.\n\n3. At the top of the folder, tap \"Edit.\" (If the mailboxes pane is visible, don't accidentally tap \"Edit\" in that.)\n\nTap the Edit button in the message pane to start the deletion process.

Tap and hold \"Move\" at the bottom of the screen.\n\nAfter selecting the first message, tap and hold \"Move.\" Dave Johnson/Business Insider\n\n6. Without lifting your finger off \"Move,\" tap the selected message again \u2014 this will deselect it. Then lift your finger off \"Move.\"\n\n7. The view should now change to show all the messages in the folder selected. If this takes a moment to appear, don't worry \u2014 if you have a lot of email, this could be a slow process.\n\n8. Tap the folder into which you want to move the emails \u2014 in this case, the Trash.\n\nAll the emails are now selected and ready to be discarded by tapping the \"Trash\" tab. Dave Johnson/Business Insider\n\nIf you change your mind, just tap \"Cancel\" or close the Mail app.\n\nIf you're moving hundreds or thousands of emails at once, it may take your iPad a few moments to delete everything. But if you check your inbox a few minutes later, everything should be gone. Repeat the above process for any other folders of email you may have.\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "To delete all the emails on your iPad, you can go through every email manually, or take advantage of a simple workaround.
