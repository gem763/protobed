Critics say it allowed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to overrun Kurdish fighters who helped the U.S. rout the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Erdogan has vowed to continue his operation if \u201cYPG\u201d fighters \u2014 Kurdish militants he considers to be aligned with terrorists \u2014 do not clear out of a safe zone outlined by the U.S.-negotiated cease-fire that expires Tuesday.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest allies fear he blundered with his initial withdrawal of troops.\n\nEvangelical supporters are worried that Christians and other religious minorities will lose their foothold in this corner of the Middle East, though Mr. Trump is moving to alleviate their concerns by offering financial support to relief groups.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: A previous version of this story misstated the amount authorized by President Trump.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
