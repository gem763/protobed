It\u2019s the latest of a succession of strikes on Fridays led by schoolchildren \u2013 but this time adults are invited to join in.\n\nWhat will happen?\n\nMillions are expected to take to the streets in more than 130 countries, with support on this occasion from unions, churches, and local community groups. Some are calling it the biggest mass protest in the history of the climate crisis.\n\nHow can you get involved?\n\nPossibly the best place to start is by consulting the Fridays for Future map, which details what is going on and where in more than 130 countries \u2013 and thousands of locations \u2013 worldwide. Hovering over the pin brings up basic details of where the action is happening.\n\nStriking all over the world\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that timings will vary from city to city and that some countries (notably New Zealand and Italy) have put back their protests until Friday 27th. More detailed information can be found by searching Twitter for a city or location near you and adding the hashtag #climatestrike.\n\nAnother useful global resource is the global climate strike website which offers ideas on how to organise workplace or lunchbreak action, as well as how to add banners to websites and social media pages, if digital solidarity is as much as you can manage.\n\nFriday\u2019s action is expected to be widespread in many countries with plenty of regional happenings to draw people who don\u2019t want to waste all that carbon by travelling. There will be an estimated 800 actions in the US, 400 in Germany, and scores more in the UK, Australia, France and Belgium. In all, 13 Indian cities and 12 Indonesian ones are taking part.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students protest in Mumbai, India, in May 2019.

London\u2019s event starts at 11am, but marchers are being warned that police will restrict them to Westminster, so careful as you go.\n\nThe action in Brussels will culminate outside EU headquarters, after starting at the city\u2019s North station. In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and \u201ccitizens meetings\u201d. The action group Lib\u00e9rons le Louvre (Liberate the Louvre) is planning an \u201caction\u201d at the museum in protest at its long-standing partnership with the petrol group Total.\n\nPlay Video 3:41 Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot make short film on climate crisis \u2013 video\n\nIn Berlin, typically, the day will climax with a 3pm outbreak of techno at the Potsdamer Platz under the motto \u201cNo Future, No Dancefloor\u201d. Extinction Rebellion have announced plans to block traffic at strategic points \u201cwhere it will hurt drivers\u201d around the capital.\n\nClimate strikes: are you taking part in Friday's protests?

Thousands are expected at the strike, which is being co-hosted by more than two dozen local and national groups.\n\nProtestors plan to gather at a park outside New York\u2019s City Hall at 12pm and march a mile down to Battery Park, where Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak in the afternoon along with other performers and speakers.\n\nIf you are out and about, do keep us posted on what is happening.\n\nBut of course, the strike is just the start.\n\nThe next question is: what will you DO?", "description": "Millions will take to the streets in global climate crisis protests from 20 to 27 September", "authors": ["Guardian Staff", "Kate Aronoff", "Nick Lowles"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2d88736828a8792c38813e711a2a0499abefe7d/0_202_5099_3059/master/5099.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d85b8a71a8f33f01b9c52aa49271ee4c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
