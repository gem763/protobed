I'm out tonight for a simple reason. You don't shoot a teenager at point-blank range,\" said Alex Chan, an interior designer at a protest in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay.\n\n\"These protests will continue and we won't give up.\"\n\nThousands more took to the streets on Wednesday in peaceful rallies to condemn the shooting of the 18-year-old secondary school student, who remains in hospital after being shot in the chest during disturbances on Tuesday.\n\nPolice say the officer fired in self-defence because he feared his life was in danger.\n\nThe student, who was brandishing a pipe, was shot at point-blank range during protests on Tuesday that turned violent in multiple locations across the city as demonstrators hurled petrol bombs at police who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nAn anti-government protester with a petrol bomb outside a police station in Tsuen Wan in Hong Kong overnight.
