Lindsey Graham, who attended the meeting, said he agreed with the approach.\n\n\u201cRestoring deterrence means we have to stop it now. Their ability is growing in terms of missiles. Their technology is improving even under sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it has to be a blow beyond what we are doing today. I think it has to be something other than sanctions.\u201d\n\nU.S. and Saudi officials determined that drones launched from Iran carried out missile strikes Saturday on Saudi oil facilities.\n\nMr. Graham, a hawkish South Carolina Republican, said Tehran was emboldened when President Trump called off a retaliatory action when Iran shot down a U.S. drone in June.\n\n\u201cIranians saw the president\u2019s restraint as weakness and not as space for diplomacy. So clearly they got the wrong message that inaction on the drone event, I think, has reinforced the narrative that the administration, the Western world [and] the region really isn\u2019t going to do much about provocations,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
