We will write to you before this payment is made to provide further details.'\n\nIt adds that it's not currently possible to predict when remaining assets will be sold and remaining money paid out.\n\nLink prepares investors for potential losses, saying: 'The fund\u2019s value fluctuates in line with the market values of its underlying assets.\n\n'If assets are sold for lower prices, you will receive less from the winding-up process and this also may be less than you originally invested.'\n\nWhat do investing experts say?\n\n'Although there were rumours this is truly shocking news,' said Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen.\n\n'We have seen the complete demise of the most famous fund manager the UK has seen for years. Investors knew the scenario was bad but the indication from Woodford thus far had been that the fund would reopen.\n\n'This collapse is on a par with the implosion of New Star at the height of the financial crisis, and it will shake the funds industry to its core.\n\n'Woodford will be removed as fund manager and the holdings in the fund will be sold. This means investors may have to wait until next year to firstly find out the value of their investment and then to get their money back. Sadly many people will be looking at significant losses.'\n\nDarius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, said Link appeared to have made its decision without much consultation with Woodford Investment Management.\n\n'The timing does seem a little odd and out of the blue \u2013 especially with Brexit possibly just days away.\n\n'More clarity from Link is required and the regulator needs to be on the ball today, this week, this month, to make sure that investors don\u2019t get hurt any more than they have already.\n\n'At the end of the day, the most important thing is, whether this is a better outcome for investors? Link suggests that investors will get their money back faster than waiting for the fund to reopen, but I\u2019m not convinced that is the case - December had been earmarked for a re-opening of the fund.'\n\n'This action also makes Woodford a forced seller of all stocks \u2013 stocks that the market place and short-sellers are all aware of. It may well mean that less money is returned to investors, so the jury is still out on this one.\n\n'My other concern is what happens with Woodford Income Focus and its investors. It\u2019s all a mess and, frankly, I don\u2019t think this is a good outcome for investors at all.'\n\nBen Yearsley, director of Shore Financial Planning, said: 'In my view, this just shows that unquoted holdings shouldn't be held in open ended funds.\n\n'The Financial Conduct Authority should now look at this and go further than they went recently to ensure this can't happen again and essentially outlaw unlisted holdings from the open ended fund structure.\n\n'From an investor's perspective this is an unsatisfactory end, however with the level of redemptions anticipated this feels like the only solution to treat all investors fairly.'\n\nRyan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell, says: 'Woodford has not managed to move out of his unlisted assets and into more liquid listed equities quickly enough to re-open the fund in December, meaning Link has determined it\u2019s in the best interests of investors for the fund to close entirely.\n\n'Woodford\u2019s name is also being wiped off the fund, as the assets will be handed to BlackRock and Park Hill to sell off, meaning Neil Woodford will no longer be the fund manager \u2013 instead it will be re-named the \"LF Equity Income Fund\".'\n\n'Link has waived its fee on the fund from the June suspension and investors won\u2019t be charged direct fees while the fund is being wound up.\n\n'However, investors will still be incurring high costs for the winding up of the fund, particularly selling off the illiquid assets. These costs will be taken out any proceeds from the sale, so will eat into the money investors get back.'\n\n\n\n", "description": "So what does this mean for the thousands of small investors with savings in the fund and how much of their money will they get back?", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
