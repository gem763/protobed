REUTERS/Henry Romero\n\nAfter taking office in December vowing to revive a sluggish economy and reduce violence, the veteran leftist has so far fallen short of the goals he set himself.\n\nLopez Obrador said last Tuesday that after a months-long dispute, he had saved taxpayers $4.5 billion by making companies renegotiate several natural gas pipeline contracts agreed to by the last government.\n\n\u201cThe companies accepted the principle that the national interest must be above the private interest, however legitimate (those interests) may be,\u201d Lopez Obrador said in his Sunday speech.\n\nSupporters of Lopez Obrador hailed the accord as a political victory for the president, who has spent years accusing business leaders of colluding with corrupt politicians to get rich.\n\nLopez Obrador underscored on Sunday that his economic plan would look to promote private enterprise, boost foreign trade and promote the attraction of foreign investment.\n\nIt is unclear if companies will feel encouraged to bet on Mexico as a result of the agreement and his comments.\n\nSome of the decisions made by Lopez Obrador, an exponent of economic nationalism, have shaken investor confidence in Mexico. Among them, his cancellation of a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport rattled markets.\n\nThe central bank said on Thursday the economy was facing headwinds, including stagnating private investment, which was affected by a persistent environment of uncertainty stemming from the public policy decisions made by the government and concerns over insecurity and corruption.\n\nIn his state of the union address, Lopez Obrador also said that income distribution would remain a priority over economic growth.\n\nThe administration will \u201cgradually push aside the technocratic obsession of measuring everything based simply on economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe equitable distribution of income and wealth\u201d will be his government\u2019s guiding principles.\n\nHe has argued that by redistributing wealth better, his government is able to help economic development among the poor even with lower headline growth numbers.\n\nMexico narrowly avoided entering a recession in the second quarter, prompting the central bank to cut its economic outlook for the year to forecast virtually no growth, citing slack conditions that will persist longer than expected.\n\nIn his first nine months in office, Lopez Obrador has repeated the message that the chronic inequality, gang violence and tepid growth afflicting Mexico are the product of decades of government by a corrupt political and economic elite still trying to resist his promise of change.", "description": "Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in his first state of the union address on Sunday, doubled down on his approach to managing Latin America's second-largest economy, saying the interests of private firms would be subordinated to those of the nation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425232425&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF81023"}
