New FBI digs inflame fight over Hoover and race", "language": "en", "text": "Black lawmakers want to strip J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s name from the proposed new FBI headquarters because they think he was a racist, outraging longtime agents who say America\u2019s culture of political correctness and victimhood has gone too far.\n\nThe fight is bursting into public view again as the FBI inches toward building a new headquarters, a plan that has been simmering for nearly a decade.\n\n\u201cJ. Edgar Hoover was an abomination on our history,\u201d said Rep. Karen Bass, California Democrat and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cI think they should find a name more reputable than J. Edgar Hoover. I mean, all that came out about him after his death: the way he threatened people, what he did in the African American community, what he did to Martin Luther King, what he did to the LGBT community, I could go on and on.\u201d\n\nBut former agents say the legacy of the FBI\u2019s first and longest-serving director has been unfairly demonized. They say Hoover\u2019s civil rights record is solid and cite his willingness to send FBI agents to the South to help blacks vote and his opposition to Japanese internment camps during World War II.\n\n\u201cAs a former agent, I am disappointed in the FBI for not doing more to defend Mr. Hoover\u2019s legacy,\u201d said William D. Brannon, a 30-year FBI veteran and chairman of the J. Edgar Hoover Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting the legacy of Hoover through scholarships to underprivileged college students.\n\nSince his death in 1972, Hoover\u2019s legacy has been mixed. Critics say he harassed civil rights leaders, discriminated against gay federal workers and amassed incriminating evidence to blackmail political figures. His supporters point to his extraordinary efforts to modernize law enforcement. Creating the FBI\u2019s fingerprint database and bringing forensic science into criminal investigations are among his accomplishments.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on whether the Hoover name will survive the transition to a new headquarters.\n\nDetermined to prove the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was under the influence of communists, the FBI kept the civil rights leader under constant surveillance from the mid-1950s until his 1968 assassination. Although FBI wiretaps did not uncover communist ties, the bureau did discover lurid details about King\u2019s sex life.\n\nHistorians have suggested Hoover spied on King to discredit him and derail the civil rights movement. Tens of thousands of FBI documents released years ago detail the bureau\u2019s animosity toward the civil rights leader. One memo describes King as an \u201cunprincipled opportunistic individual,\u201d and another calls him \u201cthe most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cJ. Edgar Hoover\u2019s legacy of counterintelligence programs was very disruptive to African American leadership in the black community along with other minority communities,\u201d said Rep. Andre Carson, Indiana Democrat, who said he contacted the FBI years ago about changing the name of its headquarters.\n\nIn 1964, Hoover called King \u201cthe most notorious liar in the country,\u201d which led to a meeting between the two. Andrew King, a longtime aide of King, has publicly stated that there \u201cwas not even an attitude of hostility\u201d during the meeting.\n\nMr. Brannon said Hoover got an unfair rap for spying on the civil rights leader and noted that the wiretap warrants were approved by then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nWithin the bureau, Hoover\u2019s record on race is complicated. The bureau hired its first black agent in 1919, nearly a full 20 years before the military integrated. A handful of blacks worked as agents for the FBI in the 1920s, but the bureau\u2019s illustrious academy did not accept its first black candidate until 1962.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the history of the FBI, they really didn\u2019t encourage diversity until 1972 or 1973 when we started hiring female agents,\u201d said Lew Schiliro, a former head of the FBI\u2019s New York field office. \u201cIts unfair to lay that all on Hoover because it was a reflection of the times he was in.\u201d\n\nPrevious efforts to remove Hoover\u2019s name from the FBI headquarters gained little traction. Rep. Steve Cohen, Tennessee Democrat, introduced legislation to expunge Hoover\u2019s name in 2015, but the measure didn\u2019t go anywhere. A year later, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, Vermont Democrat, wrote to the General Services Administration saying it would be a mistake to name a new building after the controversial director.\n\nFormer agents said the FBI would be turning its back on the agency\u2019s history if it abandons the Hoover name.\n\nHoover transformed a bureau tarnished by corruption and incompetence, creating a strict code of conduct and a stringent hiring process for agents.\n\n\u201cHe really is the father of modern law enforcement,\u201d said John F. McCaffrey, director of the J. Edgar Hoover Institute and a former agent. \u201cWe need to recognize that. He did things like establish an identification division, he brought science to law enforcement. He may have had his shortcomings, but his accomplishments were tremendous, and we want to see him recognized.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus who spoke with The Washington Times were largely opposed to keeping Hoover\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cHell, no,\u201d said Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, Louisiana Democrat.\n\nBut one Congressional Black Caucus member, Rep. Val Butler Demings, Florida Democrat, said it should be up to the agents to decide whether the bureau will continue to honor Hoover.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to understand how the men and women of the bureau feel about the first FBI director,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to listen to them.\u201d\n\nMr. Schiliro said most agents would oppose any name change.\n\n\u201cYou have to honor tradition and history regardless of the faults people might have,\u201d he said. \u201cAgents of my generation are just profoundly against something like this. J. Edgar Hoover was the FBI for so many years. To wipe out that sense of tradition and history would be a huge mistake.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
