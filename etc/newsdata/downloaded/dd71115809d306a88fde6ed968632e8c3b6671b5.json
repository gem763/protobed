An appearance by former First Lady Michelle Obama later in the day might be the additional buzz it\u2019s looking for.\n\nOn Wednesday it announced the evolution of its core product, Dropbox Spaces, so that various work folders are interlinked, and a new desktop app that functions as a digital hub where workers can collaborate with colleagues on projects that require access to digital files. Together, the products mark the latest metamorphosis of Dropbox DBX, -0.20% increasingly catering to businesses instead of consumers.\n\nDropbox Chief Executive Drew Houston, in a brief press conference following the announcement, said he was excited about the \u201cnew foundation\u201d for enterprise customers and upgrading their content-sharing experience. He quickly added the \u201cconsumer is where we grew up,\u201d and remains important.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see anyone doing what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Dropbox Chief Technology Officer Quentin Clark told MarketWatch in a one-on-one interview. He sees the company uniquely positioned to help large organizations coordinate and communicate content -- particularly in the fields of media, and manufacturing and construction.\n\nThe overhaul, on the heels of other new products unveiled in June, might also be the type of radical changes necessary at the unicorn, which was the darling of Wall Street when it went public in March 2018 only to see its stock tumble 30% since then.\n\nThe worst came in August, when shares nosedived, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Most of the decline occurred Aug. 9, the day after it reported weak billings that indicated slower growth, marring otherwise positive second-quarter results. Dropbox\u2019s revenue rose 18% to $401.5 million on adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $401.1 million in revenue on earnings of 9 cents per share.\n\nHowever, order billings and deferred revenue came in significantly below analyst expectations \u2014 troubling signs for near-term revenue growth. Dropbox has a consensus rating of \u201cOverweight\u201d from 15 FactSet analysts covering the stock, with a price target of $30.58 per share.\n\nDropbox shares dipped 0.2% to $19.79 in trading on Wednesday.\n\nIn June, Dropbox unveiled what was then the most significant overhaul of its software offerings, and a clear shot across the bow against rivals Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.44% and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL, +2.27% GOOG, +2.28% Google for workplace productivity sales.\n\nRead more: Dropbox unveils workspace apps to take on Google, Microsoft\n\nThe San Francisco-based company hoped then, and still does, to bolster revenue through a revamped cloud computing tool kit that lets users seamlessly access a variety of file types such as spreadsheets, text documents, and slideshows in a number of popular cloud computing frameworks. The company hopes more of its customers pay for the upgraded services rather than stick with a free but more bare-bones service.\n\nWith 600 million registered users, Dropbox has the scale to successfully pivot to the nascent market for content collaboration, 451 Research analyst Chris Marsh told MarketWatch. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart move\u201d by Dropbox as it moves from file sharing to a broader workplace, he said.\n\nHouston said it was too early to share user adoption numbers for Dropbox\u2019s new software lineup because it began rolling out in June.\n\nBut that was before its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nThis time around, Dropbox is banking that its latest products \u2014 and an hour-long conversation with Michelle Obama later this afternoon \u2014 will offset its recent stock slide. Splunk Inc. SPLK, -1.17% employed a similar strategy last week when it announced new products and hosted former President Barack Obama in a fireside chat.\n\nRead more: Obama weighs in on Big Data, privacy in Silicon Valley fireside chat\n\nThere is one major difference, however: President Obama\u2019s talk was on the record. Michelle Obama\u2019s talk late Wednesday on work-life balance is strictly off-the-record, with audio recordings and photos banned.", "description": "Dropbox Inc. is jazzing up its product lineup for the second time in three months to give its sagging stock a jolt.
