REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nThe two countries have been locked in trade disputes for months, slapping higher tariffs on each other\u2019s products and the U.S. withdrawing a key concession to India.\n\nThe collateral damage of the United States\u2019 trade wars is being felt around the world as President Donald Trump renegotiates relationships with many of Washington\u2019s top trading partners.\n\nWashington has been concerned about Indian policies that mandate foreign firms to store more data locally and restrict the way U.S. e-commerce giants such as Walmart-owned Flipkart (WMT.N) and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) operate.\n\nGoyal told a business conference that he was hoping to meet United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer soon.\n\n\u201cWe have almost resolved the broad contours of what we are going to announce. I don\u2019t see any great difficulty in closing the gap on the first announcement,\u201d Goyal said at the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).\n\nThe deal under discussion includes lowering tariffs on U.S. farm produce while giving Indian pharmaceuticals faster approval to enter the U.S. market.\n\nIndia dominates the world\u2019s generic drugs market and the United States is among its top importers.\n\n\u201cWith regards to the trade talks between India and the US, Commerce and Industry Minister said that things are on the right track and India is looking to the U.S. for technology, innovation, skills and quality education,\u201d a government statement quoted Goyal as saying.\n\nAccording to USISPF estimates, India-U.S. bilateral trade is projected to grow to $238 billon by 2025 from $142.1 billion in 2018.\n\nU.S. trade and investments are expected to grow in sectors such as defense, commercial aircrafts, oil and LNG, coal, machinery and electronics.\n\nIndia is aiming to promote automotive, pharmaceuticals, seafood, IT and travel services to the U.S. market.\n\nGoyal said India and the U.S. must look at a larger trade agreement, the government statement said.
