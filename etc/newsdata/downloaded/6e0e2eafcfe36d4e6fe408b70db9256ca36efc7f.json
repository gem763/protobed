If so, you\u2019re not alone. These attractive discounts are known in the industry as \u201cincentives,\u201d ways of driving down the cost of buying or leasing a new vehicle to entice you to buy.\n\nAutomakers typically place incentives on older models or slow-sellers; included on the list of incentive types are cash-back offers, special interest rates, and lease deals. The benefit to you is that these incentives can lead to big savings. However there are a few important details to consider.\n\nTypes of new-car incentives\n\nCustomer cash rebate\n\nThe simplest form of incentive is the cash rebate, a dollar amount that is applied to the price of a vehicle\u2014lowering its purchase, finance, or leasing costs. These rebates, sometimes referred to as \u201ccash back\u201d or \u201cbonus cash\u201d, are typically offered regionally or nationally, but also in special circumstances; for instance, to repeat buyers of a brand (\u201cloyalty cash\u201d), buyers who have left a competing brand (\u201cconquest cash\u201d), as well as first-time car buyers, military members, and recent graduates.\n\nLow-interest financing\n\nGenerally, the better your credit, the lower your auto loan interest rate will be. For those with excellent credit, automakers offer low or even zero-percent interest loans on specific vehicles, typically only those in dealer stock. How can they afford to do that? It\u2019s simple, really. The loans are offered (and subsidized) through a \u201ccaptive,\u201d an automaker-controlled financing company. While many of these offers are for 60-month loans, some of the lowest rates may require very short payment terms (12 or 24 months,) meaning high monthly payments.\n\nRead: How to save $2,000 or more on your next car\n\n\u201cThe common dilemma is, \u2018do I take the cash back offer, or the subsidized financing,\u2019\u201d explained Dale Pollak, founder of vAuto, a dealer inventory management firm. Typically these incentives can\u2019t be combined, and the better of the two deals may not be so obvious.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s dependent on your credit score,\u201d said Pollak. Those with excellent credit who have access to multiple great lending offers are likely best served by taking the cash rebate, which will also lower the total amount financed. Those with less stellar credit may be better served by taking the special financing, if they qualify, because those interest rates may beat the ones offered by banks and other lenders.\n\nTo know for sure which is the better deal, it\u2019s best to crunch both numbers. \u201cCalculate what you\u2019d pay with the cash back,\u201d said Pollak, \u201cand what you\u2019d pay with the special financing.\u201d\n\nLease deals\n\nEver been tempted by a lease that sounded too good to be true? Automakers often subsidize leases through their captive financing companies to create attractive low monthly payments. This is a method to put cars \u201con sale\u201d without altering their manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price. To subsidize these interest rate the manufacturers will sometimes take a bigger risk on the residual value of the vehicle (its value at the conclusion of the lease term) but that has no effect on you as the lessee.\n\nShoppers can obtain leases with very low monthly payments and with little to no money down. But also, be aware of deals that require large fees for excess mileage, vehicles disposition (sometimes known as balloon payments) and other hidden charges.\n\nDealer cash and rewards\n\nTo spur sales, automakers compensate dealers based on sales goals, typically on a per vehicle basis or an escalating stair-step scale. Excellent customer satisfaction and new customer acquisition can also earn dealer rewards.\n\nAlso see: 7 simple savings hacks that will make you richer in 2019\n\nDealers are more apt to negotiate a vehicle\u2019s purchase price if they know they\u2019ll be compensated from the manufacturer regardless. Usually these incentives play a larger role closer to the end of the month, quarter or model year as dealers look to hit their sales targets.\n\nBut because of the unadvertised nature of these incentives, dealers don\u2019t have to pass these spiffs onto buyers, nor do they have to disclose them. The key way to tap into them is to get two or more same-make dealers to compete for your business on very similar cars. Typically, slow-selling vehicles are most likely to be backed by dealer cash.\n\nGovernment incentives\n\nAutomakers aren\u2019t the only ones to offer car buying incentives; federal, state, and local governments do too, often in the form of tax credits. The most publicized is the federal incentive for plug-in electric vehicles, redeemable for up to a $7,500 tax credit, claimed during tax season.\n\nThese tax credits help make new electric vehicles more affordable, especially when leasing, since these savings can be factored into an EV\u2019s lease payment structure. However, remember that a tax credit is not a cash rebate; you must still pay or finance the entire purchase price. Also, not all buyers will qualify for the maximum credit depending on their total tax due.\n\nHow to get the best deal\n\nResearch\n\nLook-up incentive offers before you go to the dealership. Kelley Blue Book\u2019s New Car Incentives page provides up-to-date incentive information arranged by vehicle category and make.\n\nCompare\n\nIf multiple vehicles offer multiple incentives, calculate which combination of incentives saves the most money long-term. The showiest \u201cdeal\u201d may not be best, and you\u2019ll be led astray if you focus on monthly payments over the total cost to finance or ignore how much the vehicle will be worth over time.\n\n\u201cResidual value is the biggest single chunk of what you will \u2018pay\u2019 for a car over the first two to five years,\u201d said Karl Brauer, senior director of insights at Kelley Blue Book. \u201cFor that reason, an incentive that makes one car\u2019s transaction price lower than another\u2019s doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s the less expensive car long-term, even if it was the cheaper car to buy on that day.\u201d\n\nShop strategically\n\nThe time of year can dictate how few or many incentives are offered. Typically Memorial Day, Labor Day, and the year\u2019s end are met with the largest incentives. Toward the end of a month, dealers may also be more willing to negotiate, to meet incentivized monthly sales goals.\n\nNegotiate\n\nJust because you received a cash rebate doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t negotiate a lower purchase price. Remember, car dealers want these vehicles sold, and they\u2019re rewarded for doing so. Handle each step of the car buying process individually. This should still include price negotiation in addition to any incentives.\n\nDon\u2019t let incentives dictate your purchase\n\nThere\u2019s more to a car purchase than getting a so-called \u2018good deal\u2019 due to big discounts. \u201cKeep in mind what your \u2018needs\u2019 versus \u2018wants\u2019 are,\u201d suggests Brauer. \u201cIncentives can muddy the waters because you feel like you cut the price down, so now you can add more options and trim levels you wouldn\u2019t normally have bought.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why you should buy your leased car\n\n\u201cFigure out what car you really need, can afford, and if it\u2019s a responsible purchase for you,\u201d advised Brauer. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve got that down, then investigate what incentives are out there.\u201d", "description": "Incentives can lead to big savings, if you understand them.
