It\u2019s ending with hope from smaller successes.", "language": "en", "text": "WNBA teams generally fly commercial, a cost-saving measure that players say cuts recovery and preparation time and increases fatigue and risk of injury. Several teams have experienced lengthy travel delays, including last year when the Aces decided not to play a scheduled game against the Mystics after a 25-hour odyssey put them in Washington just a few hours before tip-off. The league later ruled the game a forfeit that counted as a loss for an Aces team that was chasing a playoff berth. Before this year\u2019s semifinals, however, the WNBA\u2019s first-year commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, greenlit private flights for both the Aces and Los Angeles Sparks, who both were both set to play on the East Coast two days after advancing out of the second round.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d said Delle Donne, who later that week won the league\u2019s MVP award. \u201cIt shows that the league is stepping up, they\u2019re caring about player health, player safety. So that\u2019s a great step forward.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe WNBA began its 2019 season with an appreciable amount of uncertainty. Its players had opted out of the collective bargaining agreement the previous November in hopes of gaining a bigger portion of league revenue, greater financial transparency and better working conditions; Engelbert\u2019s hiring wasn\u2019t announced until shortly before opening day; and the absence of several top stars because of injuries and personal reasons cast a shadow. But as the WNBA Finals begin Sunday in Washington between the Mystics and the Connecticut Sun, several players and officials expressed optimism that small measures could signal bigger changes.\n\n\u2018Chill. We\u2019re not doing Champagne right now\u2019: Mystics aren\u2019t satisfied with reaching WNBA Finals\n\nThe health of the league is often discussed in sound bites by outside observers: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, whose league is the founder and majority owner of the WNBA, told the Associated Press last year in a widely repeated statement that the WNBA has lost an average of $10 million a year every year since its inception in 1997. Pay disparity between the WNBA and NBA, a difference of millions of dollars on average per year per player, is cited often without mention that WNBA players aren\u2019t asking for NBA money, but rather a more equitable slice of their league\u2019s revenue.\n\nUltimately, the success of the WNBA is measured on a much larger scale than the number of private flights Engelbert allows. Revenue and the long-term fight for better pay for players remain the defining, overarching debate within the league. But narrow the lens, and those in the WNBA were encouraged by steps taken in 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think we did a phenomenal job of weathering the storms throughout the season and staying focused on making the season an amazing season \u2026 so that\u2019s a testament to us as players, the coaches and the organizations for holding it down while everything else was up in the air,\u201d said Mystics guard Natasha Cloud, who was featured this season in the league\u2019s new marketing campaign.\n\nBoth the league and the players\u2019 union are optimistic about reaching a new labor deal. The current CBA expires on Halloween.\n\n\u201cAm I pleased with CBA talks? Yes, I am,\u201d said Terri Jackson, the executive director of the Women\u2019s National Basketball Players Association. \u201cBut I\u2019m a cautiously optimistic person. I remain reserved until I see the done deal.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs for the rest of the shorter-term issues that led to some anxiety at the start of the season \u2014 missing players, no top executive \u2014 most within the league were pleased with their resolutions.\n\nAD\n\nThe feeling of reassurance starts with Engelbert, who previously was the first female chief executive at the accounting and consulting giant Deloitte and was brought on in large part for her experience in revenue generation. She was hired May 15, shortly before the regular season began, and started her tenure in July.\n\n\u201cWe were so excited when Cathy was able to join us \u2026 she is completely on board,\u201d said Carley Knox, vice president of business operations for the four-time WNBA champion Minnesota Lynx. \u201cWe will continue to fight for this league and fight for these players to get paid more, and hopefully one day will not have to go overseas at all.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWorries about missing players faded, too, once the season got underway. Breanna Stewart, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore, Skylar Diggins-Smith and Sue Bird all missed the season (or in Taurasi\u2019s case, the majority of the season) because of injury or personal reasons. In their absence, young players such as rookie of the year Napheesa Collier, Dallas\u2019s Arike Ogunbowale, Chicago\u2019s Diamond DeShields and Dearica Hamby of Las Vegas shined. The Mystics drew headlines with their record-breaking offense, and play overall was competitive.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy year,\u201d ESPN analyst LaChina Robinson said. \u201cWould I believe you if you had told me Chicago was going to be in the playoffs and one heave away from making a semifinal? No. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Phoenix, with a lot of talent on the roster even without Diana Taurasi, would struggle the way that they have this year. Or how Minnesota\u2019s kept things together with no Maya Moore, no Lindsay Whalen. It\u2019s been an interesting season.\u201d\n\nConnecticut Sun is relishing underdog role vs. Washington Mystics in WNBA Finals\n\nIncreased viewership, at least for the regular season, can be counted as another secondary victory. Television coverage expanded at the start of this season; ESPN networks bumped its order from 13 regular season telecasts in 2018, all of which were on ESPN2, to 16. ABC and ESPN aired five games, the most since 2008, and 40 games were broadcast on CBS Sports Network.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Sports Media Watch, the regular season averaged 246,000 viewers across the ESPN networks and ABC, a 7 percent increase from 2018. Viewership was up 31 percent at the all-star break but hasn\u2019t sustained into the playoffs. Viewership for Game 2 of the Aces-Mystics series, broadcast by ESPN2, was down 37 percent from Game 2 of the Mystics-Dream semifinal series last year. This year\u2019s game, however, was up against a Thursday night NFL game on Fox; last year\u2019s playoffs, because of a condensed season, were played almost entirely before the NFL season kicked off.\n\nAD\n\nEngelbert also said viewership for the league pass subscription service increased by 11 percent and merchandise sales were also up this season.\n\nAttendance across the league decreased by an average of 234 fans per game, as teams such as the Mystics moved into smaller arenas for the sake of better game atmosphere, among other things. As a result, Engelbert pointed out, a greater percentage of available seats were filled \u2014 81.7 percent of capacity, compared to 74.2 percent last year.\n\nAD\n\nSaid Engelbert: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about showing a down year this year. The women\u2019s professional sports league that\u2019s been around the longest, over 23 years, attracted 1.3 million spectators to its arena, pretty impressive. \u2026 And I do think the smaller arenas provide an amazing fan experience.\"\n\nThose within the Mystics organization count the home-court advantage they gained by downsizing from 20,000-seat Capital One Arena to 4,200-seat Entertainment and Sports Arena, which comes complete with a practice facility and training amenities on site, as a sign of progress. The team loved that it no longer has to face the prospect of moving its playoff games off its home court because of scheduling conflicts, as happened at Capital One Arena and still affects several other teams.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we have a victory right here in Washington: We had to prove that going to a new arena was beneficial, that it was good for our franchise, and that\u2019s the first thing,\u201d Mystics Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault said.\n\nAD\n\nThose small steps \u2014 better game atmosphere, greater TV exposure and a commissioner who\u2019s willing to charter a flight when it\u2019s called for \u2014 are all viewed as signs of progress as the league navigates through its larger battles.\n\n\u201cIs the league in a better place than when I came in? That\u2019s hard for me to say,\u201d said Asjha Jones, a Mystics assistant coach who entered the league as a player in 2002 and won a championship with the Lynx in 2015. \u201c \u2026 But at the same time, it\u2019s a big movement now, people are really focused and aware of the play. I think players right now have the most leverage they\u2019ve ever had. So in that way, sure. It\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe WNBA Finals pits Mystics vs. Sun and a bunch of Terps vs. each other\n\nIn clash of contrasting superstars, Elena Delle Donne\u2019s poise carries Mystics to WNBA Finals\n\nCourtney Williams is the heart of the Connecticut Sun\u2019s WNBA title quest\n\nThe WNBA\u2019s new commissioner has a lot on her plate, and growing the game is her priority\n\nAD", "description": "Increasing revenue and the players' fight for better remain defining and unsettled issues, but many in the league see reason for optimism.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wZMasYfEDWAT1VtgxVcCjVFmUww=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3YVNHNUPCAI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
