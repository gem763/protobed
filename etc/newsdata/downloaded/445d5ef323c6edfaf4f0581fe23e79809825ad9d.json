China hopes to do this by investing aggressively in overseas infrastructure projects, the experts said.\n\n\"Their single aspiration is to elevate their own status and capacity on a global scale,\" said Chad Sbragia, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, during a Thursday House Transportation subcommittee hearing. \"What it does mean is that they will have the global military where the US essentially may have no safe harbors.\"\n\nSbragia aired that warning amid the worry that China can use its economic leverage to lock out the US Navy from forward ports. His testimony underscored fears that Chinese President Xi Jinping's controversial Belt and Road Initiative is designed to give leverage to the Chinese military if the United States tries to deploy forces into the Indo-Pacific region in a crisis.\n\n\"It will not look like it did in the past. We will have to move across a space an entire way [that] could be contested both for ourselves and our allies from the start and in all domains,\" Sbragia testified.\n\nAn M1A2 Abram Tank belonging to the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, is raised over the pier ledge at the Port of Vlissingen, Netherlands, to be lowered onto a low-barge ship for transportation to another location within Europe, October 12, 2019.

Bob Gibbs, the top Republican on the Subcommittee for Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation. \"First, the dual commercial and military uses of these assets; second, that the debt incurred by these countries will tie them to China in ways that will facilitate China's international pursuits and potentially inhibit US overseas operations.\"\n\nMilitary officials agreed that China is trying to crowd Americans out of the ports at the chokepoints of global shipping.\n\n\"We just have to be present there \u2014 not just watching but actually present,\" said Air Force Lt. Gen. Giovanni Tuck, who oversees military logistics for the Joint Chiefs. \"And this is now a whole of government approach on how we actually make sure that we have the access that we need.\"\n\nChina has established one overseas military base in Djibouti, an East African country on the waterway that connects the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea. China sees the port in Djibouti, which also hosts an American port, as a \"test case\" for how to militarize other ports around the world, according to the Pentagon adviser.\n\n\"I've talked to the Chinese military, personally, about this issue they have aspiration to do so,\" Sbragia said. \"That is a first step, it's not the last step.\"", "description": "US military officials agreed that China is trying to crowd Americans out of the ports at the chokepoints of global shipping.", "authors": ["Joel Gehrke", "Washington Examiner"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c3df980bd77304d5900a716?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
