Both are bright women and have amassed a meaningful amount of wealth. One sold all her stocks when Barack Obama won the presidency. The other liquidated her portfolio of equities after Donald Trump\u2019s election. Both were wrong. Stocks, as measured by the S&P 500, produced a cumulative, total return of 116.5% from President Obama\u2019s election day 2008 through President Trump\u2019s election in November 2016. Stocks have risen 48.9% since then. Investing in one\u2019s politics can be a risky business. Think of the opportunity cost to my two friends.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Asset Management\u2019s 2019 Retirement Guide demonstrates the peril to investors of missing the best days in the stock market over a 20-year period. From Jan. 4, 1999, through Dec.r 31, 2018, the S&P 500 produced an annualized return of 5.62%. If an investor missed just the ten best days over that 20-year period their annualized return would have been 2.01%. Talk about opportunity cost! Missing the 20 best days? Your return would have dropped to a negative 0.33% annualized. Whatever the reason, attempting to time the market is dangerous to your net worth.\n\nThe willingness to own equities and the determination of how much to own should be based on your risk tolerance, age, income needs and other personal factors. But if you are interested in being exposed to stocks it is always wise to tune out the noise and remember what the great Peter Lynch of Magellan fame advised: \u201cThe key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.\u201d\n\nThis year amidst all the conflicting economic data and an easing Fed under siege by a tempestuous presidential tweet storm, it may all come down to trade.\n\nWhy is trade important to the average investor? Well, it may be as simple as the warning Fred Smith, CEO of FedEx Corp. gave on the company\u2019s recent and disappointing earnings call. Smith said the company was reducing capacity because the trade deal \u201chas reduced the movement of goods internationally.\u201d Reduced movement of goods slows growth and growth is mother\u2019s milk to corporate earnings.\n\nTo be sure it isn\u2019t just trade troubles with China. The administration is about to announce a new, narrow trade deal with Japan after years without a deal. NAFTA 2.0 (USMCA) is languishing in Congress and the president has threatened tariffs on European autos. Trade conflict with multiple trading partners gives corporate CEOs pause. We have seen that concern reflected in the lack of capital expense spending this year which has resulted in a slowdown in industrial activity.\n\nThe trade conflict has put stress on the economy, though not yet on the consumer. Low unemployment, rising wages, lower taxes and lower gas prices at the pump have put more money in the consumer\u2019s pocket.\n\nIt's best to buy great companies you know and understand, collect and reinvest the dividends and avoid the noise of politics and investment pundits who don\u2019t consider your personal objectives. If the trade issues resolve \u2013 all things being equal \u2013 the market may experience another leg up. And, it would be a shame to miss it.\n\nNancy Tengler is chief investment strategist at Tengler Wealth Management, ButcherJoseph Asset Management and the author of \u201cThe Women\u2019s Guide to Successful Investing.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Dow: Timing stock market can be dangerous to your 401(k)", "description": "It is always wise to tune out the noise as fear and even politics can keep investors from missing out on the best days of the stock market.", "authors": ["Nancy Tengler", "Special To Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
