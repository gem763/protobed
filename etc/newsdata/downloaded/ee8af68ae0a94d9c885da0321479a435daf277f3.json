In the municipal government\u2019s endless war against the insufficiently woke, a new weapon has been added to the social justice warriors\u2019 arsenal. The City Hall Commission on Human Rights has now issued an edict saying that it will henceforth be illegal to use the phrase \u201cillegal alien\u201d if it\u2019s directed at someone in a way that is \u201cmotivated by hate.\u201d You will also be in violation of the law if you threaten to call immigration enforcement on an illegal alien. And the fines you can be hit with are jaw dropping. (NY Post)\n\nIt\u2019s now against the law in New York City to threaten someone with a call to immigration authorities or refer to them as an \u201cillegal alien\u201d when motivated by hate. The restrictions \u2014 violations of which are punishable by fines of up to $250,000 per offense \u2014 are outlined in a 29-page directive released by City Hall\u2019s Commission on Human Rights. \u201c\u2018Alien\u2019 \u2014 used in many laws to refer to a \u2018noncitizen\u2019 person \u2014 is a term that may carry negative connotations and dehumanize immigrants, marking them as \u2018other,\u2019\u201d reads one passage of the memo. \u201cThe use of certain language, including \u2018illegal alien\u2019 and \u2018illegals,\u2019 with the intent to demean, humiliate, or offend a person or persons constitutes discrimination.\u201d\n\nSo using the same phrase that appears all through Title 8 of federal law to identify an illegal alien in New York City can now land you in hot water. And if you inform the illegal alien that you are going to report their unlawful presence in the country to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), not only will the police not assist the feds in taking the illegal into custody, but they may be dispatched to take you in if the person files a complaint.\n\nThen you may have to cough up a quarter-million dollars in fines to the city. (And given how badly the budget has been mismanaged under the de Blasio administration, they could probably use the money.) Isn\u2019t that just lovely?\n\nThe ironic thing here is that it\u2019s still technically legal (though very messed up) to use a racial epithet against a citizen, provided it\u2019s not in the workplace, it\u2019s against the law to identify a criminal based on their illegal status. And while you are encouraged to report virtually any other crime you observe to the police for investigation, suggesting that you might report this particular crime can wind up bankrupting you in municipal court.\n\nOh, and there\u2019s even more good news for illegal aliens in the Big Apple. The Mayor is going to try to order bars and restaurants to accept city ID cards (which illegal aliens in New York City can now sign up for, along with driver\u2019s licenses). And he\u2019s doing it despite the fact that it\u2019s a violation of state law to accept that ID for the sale of alcohol. (They can only accept a driver\u2019s license, a non-driver ID card issued by the DMV, a U.S. military ID, a valid passport or a visa from any country.)\n\nIn New York City the patients are now running the mental asylum. Flee while you can, folks. Somebody is eventually going to wise up and just build a huge wall around Gotham and trap you all there.", "description": "Watch your tongue", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/deBlasio.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
