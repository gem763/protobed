And other power companies warned they could follow suit.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nThough utilities have warned for months that preemptive cutoffs were a possibility, the outages appeared to be catching many consumers by surprise. While many Florida and East Coast residents have long learned to cope with power outages from hurricanes, weather-related outages could be considered a new phenomenon in the Golden State.\n\nThe website for Pacific Gas & Electric, serving Northern and Central California, was swamped by those seeking more information, and many customers complained the pages couldn't be accessed. Likewise, Southern California Edison customers were having trouble accessing the power-outage section of its website.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some answers to key questions.\n\nWhere are the outages now and where will they be?\n\nPG&E began shutting off power Wednesday morning, cutting off more than 500,000 homes and businesses in Northern California. The utility turned off electricity for another 234,000 in major cities including San Jose and Santa Cruz starting around 10:30 p.m. through midnight Pacific time after delays.\n\nAn additional 4,000 customers in Kern County may also lose power Thursday, depending on weather conditions, PG&E said.\n\n'PG&E clearly hasn't made its system safe': California lawmakers slam utility amid widespread power outage\n\nFarther south, where gusty Santa Ana winds weren't expected until early Thursday, Southern California Edison announced it may turn off power to more than 170,000 customers in its 50,000-square-mile service area. It includes at least 49,024 in the northern reaches of Los Angeles County and 20,449 in Ventura County.\n\nSan Diego Gas & Electric said it is prepared to cut power to 34,022 customers, with most of the communities affected in inland areas.\n\nBecause a single customer account can serve a household or business, the estimated number of people without power was expected to reach 2 million.\n\nIf they haven't already, when will they cut my power?\n\nThere is no set time. Utilities plan to make the calls based on conditions \u2014 wind speed is not the only factor.\n\nSouthern California Edison said it will also take into account humidity and ground observations before cutting power. It'll be a judgment call.\n\nWhy are there power outages?\n\nPower lines were blamed for sparking the Camp Fire nearly a year ago that killed 85 people, blackened 153,000 acres and destroyed 14,000 structures in Northern California. The town of Paradise, population 26,800 as of 2010, was so devastated that only 2,034 residents were left by April.\n\nPG&E filed for bankruptcy after a cascade of lawsuits arising from the fires. To avoid being blamed for another conflagration and having to shoulder massive payouts due to fires from downed lines, utilities have decided to cut power during high-wind episodes.\n\nHow long will the power be out?\n\nUnclear. It could be hours or could be days, based on conditions. Crews could begin visually inspecting Northern California power lines on Friday, said PG&E VP Sumeet Singh, and restore power quicker if the lines are not damaged.\n\nWhat should I do if my power is cut?\n\nHome Depot reports a brisk business in selling gasoline-powered generators and other supplies.\n\n\"Our stores have been busy with customers coming in to purchase emergency items like gas cans, lanterns, batteries, cell phone chargers and generators. Our merchandising and supply chain teams are working hard to replenish these important items as quickly as possible to best serve customers,\" said spokeswoman Margaret Smith.\n\nCompeting home center chain Lowe's also reported \"strong demand\" and reported to have stocked up in advance.\n\n\"We have 35 stores in the areas affected by the outage and our Emergency Command Center has shipped more than a dozen truckloads of generators, water, flashlights, lanterns, batteries and other supplies to help these communities during the outage,\" said spokesman Steve Salazar.", "description": "To prevent fires, PG&E; has started cutting electricity to more than 1 million Californians amid high wind forecasts.
