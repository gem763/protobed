It's devastating that I've gone through all of that and it's just been dropped.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bonny Turner says the CPS dropped her case even though her alleged rapist apologised to her on Facebook Messenger\n\nThe annual Violence Against Women and Girls report shows the number of reports of rape that end in a conviction is about 3%.\n\nThe figures also reveal that the number of suspects charged with rape or another offence has fallen, from 2,822 in 2017-18 to 1,758 in 2018-19.\n\nIn 2007-08, when records were first compiled in the current way, 2,220 cases resulted in a charge.\n\nOf those, 2,201 cases resulted in a conviction - although some would be for investigations started in previous years.\n\nThe conviction figure takes in the number of suspects initially investigated for rape who were later convicted of rape or other offences, such as sexual assault or indecent assault.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill says he \"would be worried\" by the figures if he were a victim of sexual violence\n\nThe CPS - whose budget has been cut by 25% since 2010 - says it has worked hard to improve how it deals with sexual offence cases.\n\nIt explains the drop by saying it is getting fewer rape referrals from police - a 23% fall from the previous year - and that cases are taking longer because of digital evidence and the demands to disclose material to the defence.\n\n'Abandoning thousands of cases'\n\nA coalition of women's organisations, represented by the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ), is looking to take legal action against the CPS over claims cases are being \"dropped\" without good reason.\n\nLawyer Harriet Wistrich, founder of the CWJ, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"compelling\" evidence the collapse in prosecutions was mainly caused by \"a deliberate change in the approach taken by the CPS dating back to late 2016\".\n\nDame Vera Bair, the victims' commissioner, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene by giving the justice system adequate resources and funding support services for survivors.\n\nShe questioned whether \"abandoning thousands of cases of potentially traumatised men and women\" was \"ineptitude\" or \"deliberate policy\" by prosecutors.\n\nMax Hill, director of public prosecutions, denied there had been a change in approach from prosecutors at the CPS, but said he shared concerns at the \"growing gap\" between reported rapes and the number of prosecutions.\n\nHe told Today: \"I am not going to point the finger in any particular direction. We - all of us working in the criminal justice system - need to come together now to discuss this.\"\n\nDeputy Chief Constable Sarah Crew, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for rape and adult sexual offences, said the decline in convictions reflects \"a justice system that is stretched and under pressure\".\n\nBut she said police were working with victims' groups to address issues that prevent people from reporting rape or from continuing to support an investigation.\n\nThe independent CPS watchdog, Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, has also launched a review of charging decisions in rape cases.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?
