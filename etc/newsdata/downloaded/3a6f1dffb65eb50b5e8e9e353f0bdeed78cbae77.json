They let a fraudster with ties to the Clintons get his hands on a smartphone that he used to falsify evidence. They even let an Islamic terrorist have access to al Qaeda propaganda \u2014 including bomb-making instructions \u2014 that he distributed to \u00adfellow inmates.\n\nThe security breaches at the MCC are so egregious that prison inspectors wonder why Epstein was ever sent there in the first place.\n\nPHOTOS SEEN IN JEFFREY EPSTEIN MANSION RAID APPARENTLY SHOWED FIDEL CASTRO, POPE JOHN PAUL II\n\n\u201cMCC has had major screw-ups in the past,\u201d said Patrick Dunleavy, a former deputy inspector general for the New York state Department of Corrections. \u201cIt\u2019s strange that they put Epstein there.\u201d\n\n\u201cMCC has had major screw-ups in the past. It\u2019s strange that they put Epstein there.\u201d \u2014 Patrick Dunleavy, former deputy inspector general, New York state Department of Corrections\n\nLast year, according to the documents, a former CIA employee allegedly responsible for \u201cthe largest unauthorized public disclosure of CIA information in the history of the agency\u201d was able to get two iPhones into his cell at the MCC. The outrageous security breach was aided by correctional officers.\n\n\u201cThe contraband cellphones were smuggled into the MCC and protected from detection through a network of visitors to the facility, inmates and correctional officers,\u201d FBI agent Jeff Donaldson wrote in an October affidavit for a search warrant that was recently unsealed and obtained by The Post.\n\nAs part of his work for the CIA, Joshua Adam Schulte specialized in hacking computers and computer networks. He reportedly put those skills to use once he obtained the smartphones, transferring data to co-conspirators outside the MCC through encrypted accounts in Switzerland. He also used them to leak sealed federal search warrants to reporters at The New York Times and Washington Post, with the CIA determining that at least one of the newspapers\u2019 articles contained classified information.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Schulte also gained access to a laptop in the prison library on which he created \u201ccovert partitions to hide data, including potentially classified information,\u201d as well as \u201cchild pornography,\u201d the \u00adaffidavit says.\n\nSchulte\u2019s cellmate at MCC happened to be Omar Amanat, a cousin of Hillary Clinton confidante Huma Abedin and a Clinton Foundation donor. A tech entrepreneur who owned stakes in a film studio behind the \u201cTwilight\u201d movies, Amanat was locked up on securities fraud charges for which a jury convicted him in 2017.\n\nLike Schulte, Amanat also reportedly obtained a smuggled cellphone, which the feds say Schulte helped him use to create a \u201cfraudulent report,\u201d including phony, backdated emails, intended to \u201cprove Amanat\u2019s alleged innocence.\u201d\n\nThe men were housed together in the 7 South Unit of the Park Row prison beginning in December 2017. Amanat was recently transferred to another federal detention facility in Brooklyn, while Schulte, who is awaiting trial, remains locked up at MCC (though he was moved in June to a \u201cspecial housing unit\u201d there).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMCC guards also failed to screen prisoners for terrorist contraband. Other Justice Department documents show that in 2017, they let the \u201cChelsea bomber,\u201d Ahmad Khan Rahimi, gain access to evidence against him that included al Qaeda literature, complete with instructions for making improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.\n\nRahimi then distributed the copies of al Qaeda\u2019s \u201cInspire\u201d magazine in the MCC\u2019s cells and the prison mosque where Muslim inmates hold Friday prayers.\n\n\u201cThe materials included speeches and lectures by Anwar al-Awlaki and Usama Bin Laden, books on Jihad, bomb-making instructions, nasheeds [Islamic chants] espousing jihadist ideology, and various issues of \u2018Inspire,\u2019 \u201d according to a 10-page letter from former acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon Kim.\n\nClearly, Epstein\u2019s death is a symptom of much deeper problems at the federal lockup.", "description": "Bombshell Justice Department documents reveal that guards at the federal prison in Manhattan where child sex fiend Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself are notorious for not watching high-risk, high-profile inmates \u2014 and even helped one\u00a0smuggle in contraband.", "authors": ["Patrick Dunleavy", "Former Deputy Inspector General", "New York State Department Of Corrections"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/23/694940094001_6076283032001_6076278111001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
