Instead, he painted it as a \u201close-lose for the fan and the artist,\u201d because the musicians aren\u2019t sharing in the profits from the marked-up tickets, either.\n\nSo YellowHeart can allow a musician, concert venue or other \u201cevent initiator\u201d to set up rules for how their tickets are resold. Katz said he\u2019s hoping that some brave artists will simply say their tickets can\u2019t be sold at a marked-up price, but he predicted that many more will set price ceilings and dictate that any resale profits are then split between the seller, the artist and/or a charity of the artist\u2019s choosing.\n\n\u201cNo matter where the tickets are sold, they have to abide by those rules,\u201d Katz added. That\u2019s because the ticket sales run on a public blockchain, and \u201call transactions go through YellowHeart, all the revenue flows through YellowHeart.\u201d\n\nThe plan is to launch the ticketing platform in the second quarter of next year. Katz said users should be able to sell their tickets on any marketplace that works with YellowHeart\u2019s smart contracts \u2014 but he acknowledged that it will take some time to bring partners on-board and for those integrations to go live.\n\nKatz argued that the blockchain approach has other benefits, like the fact that each ticket will have \u201ca unique key that is tied to a user\u2019s identity and sits in their virtual wallet,\u201d which should eliminate forgery. (The ticketing process, by the way, will be \u201cfully digital end-to-end,\u201d except that venues will have the option to print tickets at the box office.)\n\nKatz has a background in the music industry, having previously founded El Media Group, which creates custom playlists for hotels, restaurants and other clients. He founded YellowHeart with The Chainsmokers, along with their manager Adam Alpert, who\u2019s also CEO of Disruptor Records.\n\n\u201cWith The Chainsmokers, we\u2019ve been outspoken about the issue of scalpers for years, and are excited to partner with YellowHeart to provide a smart and effective solution that gives control back to artists and fans,\u201d Alpert said in a statement.\n\nAnd Katz suggested that YellowHeart\u2019s platform could eventually be used in any other kind of event ticketing.\n\n\u201cI am anticipating this being a great platform for sports and theater as well,\u201d he said. \u201cMyself and Adam and Drew [Taggart] and Alex [Pall of The Chainsmokers] come out of music, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting.\u201d", "description": "YellowHeart is trying to solve a problem that should be familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever tried to buy a ticket for a popular concert: Those tickets will often get snatched up by scalpers, who then resell them at a much higher price.
