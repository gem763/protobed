You can see where this is going.\n\n\"So the other night, when she was near home, I waited around the corner at the end of our street,\" he said.\n\n\"When she came around, I jumped out to scare her. She screamed and dropped her phone.\n\n\"When she realised it was me, she got super p***ed off and said I was an a**hole.\n\n\"I told her that I was trying to make her see what could happen if she doesn't get transport home, and she was still really angry.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\n\"Everyone she has told thinks I'm the asshole, but I really think she needed a reality check.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the man who used his girlfriend's own fears against her, scores of strangers on the internet confirmed that her evaluation of the situation was spot on.\n\nOne said: \"You're the a**hole for sure because jumping out of the bushes to scare a young woman walking home alone at night who is already worried about walking home alone at night is pretty much universally a s*** thing to do.\n\n\"Here's the kicker though - you're an asshole for doing it because you know she's already worried about it.\"\n\nAnother replied: \"Like, as women it is one of our worst nightmares to be somewhere alone in the dark and be grabbed, kidnapped, or assaulted by a stranger, which is probably exactly what his girlfriend thought was happening when he jumped out at her.\n\n\"Not to mention he could have caused her a heart attack, for real.\"\n\nA third suggested his girlfriend might have learned something after all: \"The main lesson she's going to take away from this is that her boyfriend is an inconsiderate a**hole.\"\n\nMust do better.", "description": "A boyfriend wanted to show his partner what could happen when she walks home in the dark but got it very, very wrong", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Getty Images Eyeem", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706571.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rear-View-Of-Woman-Walking-On-Illuminated-Street-At-Night.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
