Long Beach police spokeswoman Arantxa Chavarria said that the moviegoers self-evacuated the theater because of a \u201csuspicious subject inside.\u201d\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nThe official Long Beach Police Department posted a statement on their official Facebook page saying, \u201c\u202aOfficers were on scene within a minute of dispatch & discovered patrons had self-evacuated due to a suspicious male adult who was wearing a backpack and looking out at the crowd near an emergency exit inside the theater.\u201d\n\nThey added, \u201cThe suspect was detained and was not found in possession of any weapons, however he was taken into custody for an unrelated outstanding warrant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comes after the Cinemark Century Huntington Beach and XD cineplex closed on October 3 after receiving word of a \u201ccredible threat\u201d surrounding the movie.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the release of Joker, the Warner Bros. film has raised eyebrows in a year of mass shootings across the nation, along with its IP connection to the July 2012 shooting in Aurora, CO at the midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises that killed 12 and wounded 70. Last month, several of the Aurora victims\u2019 families spoke out about concerns over the film. In response, Warner Bros sought to address those concerns and promised \u201cit is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d\n\nDuring the film\u2019s premiere last week, there was heightened security but luckily there were no threats. However, police from Los Angeles to New York still remained vigilant during opening weekend. Theater chains including AMC and Landmark have issued bans on masks being worn by patrons and other concealments. The Cinemark site\u2019s Joker listings page highlights its \u201ccostume policy\u201d which states \u201cthat masks, hats, helmets that cover the face, and face painting are not allowed within the theatre or auditoriums. Additionally, simulated weapons are not permitted in the theatre or auditorium.\u201d\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
