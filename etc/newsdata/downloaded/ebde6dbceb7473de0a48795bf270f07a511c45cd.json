(Hey!) You! (You!) Stop Using Our Songs!", "language": "en", "text": "Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones. Photo: Gary Miller/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump, a man of wealth and taste, has played the Rolling Stones\u2019 music for the last time. The band has issued a statement to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, insisting that the Republican presidential nominee refrain from playing their music at his campaign rallies and to \u201ccease all use immediately.\u201d Sad day! Trump played \u201cStart Me Up\u201d at an event on Tuesday, and frequently blasted \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d on the trail \u2014 which is fitting, as those who go down to his demonstrations often get their fair share of abuse.\n\nUpdate, July 23: Trump continues to get no satisfaction. On the last day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Trump once again chose to use \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d to close out the week\u2019s festivities following his speech. And, just like in May, the Stones aren\u2019t too thrilled about it. In a now-deleted tweet from their official Twitter account on Friday, the band stated: \u201cThe Rolling Stones do not endorse Donald Trump. \u2018You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u2019 was used without the band\u2019s permission.\u201d At this rate, Trump might never stop, never stop, never stop, never stop.", "description": "Blame the RNC.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2016/05/05/05-mick-jagger.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2016-07-23"}
