They couldn't do it, I knocked it up in four months,\" he told a rally in Iowa ahead of his election in 2016.\n\nIn January 2018, while talking about building a wall on the Mexican border, Trump said the rink proved he builds \"under budget\" and \"ahead of schedule.\"\n\nThe Trump Organization, which still runs the rinks, did not respond when AFP sought comment asking why his name has been taken down from the facilities.\n\nTrump's name continues to adorn several skyscrapers in New York but has been removed from some residential buildings, by residents who disagree with his politics or some who felt his name now devalues their apartment.\n\nWith the licenses to run the rinks up for renewal in 2021, it is possible the Trump Organization wanted to avoid any criticism that could see it lose the contracts.\n\nTrump has repeatedly been criticized over his business interests since entering the White House.\n\nThis month he reversed a decision to hold the next G7 summit at one of his Florida golf clubs after his initial announcement sparked corruption allegations.", "description": "Ice skaters on the two rinks in New York's Central Park have long glided, or stumbled, past large red signs spelling \"Trump.\" Not this season, officials confirmed Wednesday.
