Nancy Pelosi teases Donald Trump after he posts picture of confrontational White House meeting", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 After a tense day between Capitol Hill lawmakers and the White House, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a little fun.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted a photo of a group in a meeting at the White House, with Pelosi standing at the table, pointing a finger at the president. In his tweet, Trump said Pelosi had an \"unhinged meltdown.\"\n\nSo, Pelosi made it the cover photo on her Twitter and Facebook pages.\n\nLawmakers and the administration met Wednesday to discuss Turkey and Syria, a meeting that resulted in congressional Democrats walking out of a meeting after they claimed the president was \u201cdemeaning\u201d toward Pelosi, and had a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\nPelosi, one of the only women in the photograph, is seen standing and addressing the room with the president and other Republicans across the table.\n\nPelosi's highlighting the photo quickly went viral.\n\nThe House of Representatives overwhelmingly backed a resolution Wednesday condemning Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a rare bipartisan rebuke at a time when the president is trying to shore up GOP support to stave off impeachment.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said Pelosi left today's meeting after Trump called her a \"third-rate politician,\" to which Pelosi said she responded: \"I wish you were a politician, Mr. President. Then you would know the art of the possible.\"\n\n\"Do you think they like me?\" Trump tweeted additionally, showing a picture of Democratic leaders.\n\nPelosi has gone viral before following things that have been seen as poking fun at the president, like when she stretched out her arms to loudly clap at Trump's last State of the Union address, or when she became a meme after confidently putting on sunglasses while leaving a contentious meeting at the White House last December.", "description": "After a tense day between Capitol Hill lawmakers and the White House, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi found a way to have a little fun.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/17/USAT/93a4e96a-1aad-4bbc-b9fb-ace1eabeb5de-AP_Trump_1.JPG?crop=5471,3078,x0,y278&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
