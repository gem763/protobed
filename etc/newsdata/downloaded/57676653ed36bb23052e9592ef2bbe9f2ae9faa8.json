Vietnam only allows one single party and does not allow any competing opposition.\u201d\n\nVoung also shared updates about the protests in Hong Kong as well as cases of land-grabbing and political prisoners at home.\n\nVietnamese police said they had repeatedly visited Vuong at home since 2017 urging him to stop but he had continued to \u201cdefame\u201d the government.\n\nThe Communist party of Vietnam has been in power since 1975 and the one-party government maintains a tight grip on the media and severe restrictions on freedom of expression and association. His arrest is the latest in an ongoing crackdown against critics and pro-democracy activists. This year 11 people have been convicted for criticising the government, and sentenced to between two and nine years in prison, including for posts on social media.\n\nHRW has called on Facebook to take a stand. \u201cFacebook, as one of the most widely used communications platforms in Vietnam, has leverage to publicly raise human rights concerns with the government,\u201d said Sifton. \u201cWhile the company is subject to pressure from Vietnam, it also has clout because of its immense popularity in the country.\u201d", "description": "Nguyen Quoc Duc Vuong is being held in conditions \u2018conducive to mistreatment or torture\u2019, says Human Rights Watch", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e79fcae907e605671b47f759496bc970ad9eab6/0_112_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ba5b353f9bc6cbbcc37eec477905a92", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
