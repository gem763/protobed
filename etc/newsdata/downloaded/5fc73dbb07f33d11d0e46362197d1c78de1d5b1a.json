Among the assets that Elliott could push AT&T to sell are its Mexican wireless-phone business and its DirecTV satellite business.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet fell slightly after attorneys general from all 50 states formally unveiled an antitrust probe of Google's operations.\n\nInterpublic promoted longtime executive Philippe Krakowsky to a newly created position of chief operating officer, putting him in line to succeed Chief Executive Michael Roth.\n\nWrite to Rob Curran at rob.curran@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 09, 2019 17:06 ET (21:06 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
