Commenting on the decision to levy sanctions, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial, Sigal Mandelker, said:\n\nTreasury is taking action against North Korean hacking groups that have been perpetrating cyber attacks to support illicit weapon and missile programs. We will continue to enforce existing U.S. and UN sanctions against North Korea and work with the international community to improve cybersecurity of financial networks.\n\nApart from the 2014 Sony hack and the WannaCry ransomware attack, these state-sponsored cybercrime groups have been implicated in numerous Bitcoin exchange hacks.\n\nAs previously reported by Bitcoinist, these attacks have resulted in the theft of more than $2 billion in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMany of these hacks target exchanges in South Korea and Japan. However, intelligence reports say platforms across Southeast Asia are also vulnerable.\n\nThese hacking syndicates also target other areas of the global finance infrastructure such as the SWIFT network and ATMs. Reports indicate the groups have seen success in attacks on banks in countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, and the Philippines among others.\n\nPyongyang Claims Innocence\n\nBack in August 2019, authorities in Pyongyang denied reports that the government was sponsoring these cybercrime syndicates.\n\nBoth U.S. and United Nations cybersecurity experts have in the past linked the country\u2019s government to these cybercrime syndicates.\n\nThese reports also say that Pyongyang is funneling the proceeds of these bitcoin exchange hacks into the development of its nuclear weapons program.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the North Korean government, the allegations are part of an international conspiracy by the West to tarnish the country\u2019s image.\n\nFor security apparatus in the U.S., the goal is to prevent North Korea from developing weapons of mass destruction. Thus, the Trump administration plans to confiscate any assets owned by the sanctioned entities in the United States.\n\nWhat do you think about OFAC levying sanctions on North Korea for allegedly hacking bitcoin exchanges?
