In the moment, it can also seem like getting back at your partner could be the easiest way to call it even and move on from the cheating.\n\nIn reality, revenge cheating could lead to the demise of a marriage, relationship therapist and psychologist Tammy Nelson told Business Insider. \"When you feel betrayed, you think, 'If I just betray my partner, we can move on,' but in reality, you don't just move on,\" Nelson said.\n\nStill, many people turn to revenge cheating. One-third of cheaters who signed up for an account on affair website IllicitEncounters.com said they did so to get back at a partner for having an affair, according to a 2018 survey from the site.\n\nHere's what can go wrong in a revenge cheating scenario.\n\nAny revenge-based action will only make existing problems worse\n\nA relationship without trust isn't really a relationship at all. Getty Images\n\nThe concept of revenge cheating implies that a relationship can be treated like a balance sheet, where if one person does something wrong, it can be \"fixed\" by the other partner doing the same wrong thing.\n\nBut relationships aren't transactional, so taking this approach will only exacerbate the distance partners feel between each other following an affair. Nelson says couples can never go back to the way things were before the cheating simply because they're \"even.\"\n\nRevenge cheating is also likely to result in the end of a relationship or marriage because it signals that the revenge cheater is thinking, \"You broke trust, so now it's my turn to break yours.\" But two people not trusting each other is worse than one not trusting the other. A trust-less relationship isn't really a relationship at all, or at least not a healthy one, Nelson said.\n\nRead more: 12 science-backed facts about cheating that all couples should know\n\nAdditionally, cheating for revenge can lead to feelings of guilt, rather than the desired effect of relief. \"People think they can just get it out of their systems, but they have to live with their own infidelity and integrity then,\" Nelson said.\n\nIt's possible to forgive your partner for cheating without seeking revenge\n\nCheating for revenge can lead to feelings of guilt.

For example, a person might feel more young, fearless, or sexy when cheating because they are exploring a new or hidden side of themselves.\n\nAfter the cheater determines how they felt while being unfaithful, they have to ask themselves why they felt they couldn't be that person with their spouse or partner. Nelson calls it a \"wake up or break up moment.\" \"If you are going to wake up and change your relationship and [yourself,] it could be an incredible moment,\" she said.", "description": "Relationships aren't like balance sheets, so cheating as revenge will likely backfire.
