The Humboldt team is also celebrating its 50th anniversary and plans to welcome various alumni.\n\nHumboldt Broncos bus crash survivor Ryan Straschnitzki, left, is now focusing on making Canada's national sledge hockey team. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)\n\nStraschnitzki said returning this weekend seemed like the right opportunity.\n\n\"I've got a lot of mixed feelings about going back. It seems like a long time ago now.\"\n\nThe driver of the semi, Jaskirat Singh Sidhu of Calgary, pleaded guilty to 29 counts of dangerous driving for causing the crash. He was sentenced earlier this year to eight years in prison.\n\nCourt heard that the rookie driver was distracted by a flapping tarp on the back of his load when he barrelled through a rural stop sign and into the path of the hockey team's bus.\n\nGraysen Cameron of Olds, Alta., fractured a vertebrae in the crash.\n\nHe took an assistant coaching role last year with the Red Deer Midget AAA Optimist Chiefs, his former team in the Alberta Midget Hockey League before he joined the Broncos. He then had surgery to remove metal rods and screws in his back in an attempt to improve his mobility.\n\nThe 20-year-old is back playing for the Broncos this season.\n\n\"I think it's great that Graysen is back with the Broncos \u2014 and he's been named the captain,\" Straschnitzki said.\n\n\"I spent some time with Graysen in Kelowna over the summer and that's when I decided to go. I want to be there for him and it will be great to see some of the guys.\"\n\nStraschnitzki said he also hopes to see fans and meet with billet families.\n\nA decision on whether he'll visit the site of the bus crash near Nipawin, Sask., is still up in the air.\n\n\"Going to Humboldt is one thing. But whether I will be able to go to the site \u2014 might be too difficult,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe if I were to go with some of the other guys.\"\n\nWhile still in hospital after the collision, Straschnitzki decided to take up sledge hockey and has kept himself busy pursuing a spot on Canada's national sledge hockey team.\n\nEarlier this year, he signed a deal with Adidas to participate in its hockey and training campaigns.", "description": "The 20-year-old's visit coincides with the Broncos hosting the Notre Dame Hounds in their season opener Saturday night.
