For instance, this past week Volkswagen created a buzz in Frankfurt by showing off its first-ever electric urban car, the ID.3.\n\nThe prices for the Volkswagen ID.3 have not yet been announced, but the German manufacturer is hinting at a base model with a 45 kWh battery providing a range of 330 km for a little under 30,000 euros. As of now, the Volkswagen e-Golf goes for a starting price of 33,950 euros, while the new compact e-Up! should soon be sold at a starting price of 23,000 euros.\n\nFor the moment, the most competitive solution is offered by Skoda with the Citigoe iV, which will be released in early 2020 for a little under 20,000 euros. Over at Renault, the ZOE sells at a starting price of 19,900 euros, without battery rental.\n\nTo make the under 10,000 EV project a reality, Renault could draw from the City K-ZE, a small model created for the Chinese market, which it first unveiled in the spring of 2019 and should officially release for a low, low price sometime in 2020. The small vehicle is directly inspired by urban SUVs, with numerous integrated technologies such as a touchscreen featuring navigation aids and online services, a rear view back-up camera, parking sensors, etc, and boasting a range of over 250 km. It is also touted as easy to charge via any type of outlet, whether public or domestic.\n\nShould the experiment prove successful, it is highly possible that a version of the car could appear on European shores in the next few years, whether as a Renault or even as a Dacia.", "description": "For instance, this past week Volkswagen created a buzz in Frankfurt by showing off its first-ever electric urban car, the ID.3.
