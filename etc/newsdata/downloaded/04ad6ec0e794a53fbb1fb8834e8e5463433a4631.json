Of course it has not,\u201d Hall wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe mother said she had just paid off the phone two days prior and also bought a new Otterbox cover for the device.\n\nHowever, although she was about to \u201cpuke and cry,\u201d Hall went inside the restaurant to see if anyone could help her.\n\n\u201cThe manager comes over to talk to me and is very friendly but unsure how to help. Just then another employee behind her says he is going to grab a grab-stick and a mirror to try and help,\u201d she recalled.\n\nSeth, the location\u2019s digital marketing director, attempted to reach the phone by lying on the ground, but he was unsuccessful. Hall\u2019s son was hungry, so the three went inside the building. Seth refunded Hall\u2019s mobile dine-in order, then proceeded to call the county to ask for assistance in getting her phone out of the storm drain.\n\nHowever, Hall said they hung up on him when he made his request.\n\nOnce the mother and her son finished eating, they went back outside to make another attempt to reach the phone.\n\nThat was when Seth realized the manhole\u2019s heavy cover was not bolted down, so he removed it and proceeded to climb inside.\n\n\u201cAfter trying to reach it with his grab-stick then dropping his stick, he tells me it\u2019s a manhole for a reason and he is going down. He then climbs down into the hole and retrieves my phone which miraculously is not broken or wet,\u201d Hall wrote.\n\nThe mom also noted that Seth had just ended his workday but was more than willing to help in her time of need.\n\n\u201cNot only did he slice his finger and was filthy from laying on the ground and climbing in the hole, I find out he had actually just gotten off shift and was still willing to help me,\u201d she commented.\n\n\u201cService with a smile. Just another day at Chick-fil-A,\u201d Hall\u2019s Facebook post concluded, accompanied by a picture of Seth smiling from inside the manhole.\n\nOn August 2, Breitbart News reported that in an annual nationwide pole, Chick-fil-A took first place as America\u2019s favorite fast-food restaurant.\n\n\u201cThis year, Chick-fil-A became the third-largest fast-food chain in the U.S., ranking only behind McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks in sales. The company\u2019s sales growth is exceptional considering that the chain is closed on Sundays,\u201d the report stated.", "description": "A Chick-fil-A employee went beyond the call of duty when a woman in Stafford, Virginia, accidentally dropped her iPhone down a storm drain.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Chick-fil-A-employee-climbs-down-manhole-for-customer-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
