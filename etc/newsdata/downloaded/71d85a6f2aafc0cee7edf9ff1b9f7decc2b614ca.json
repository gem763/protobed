The squad were informed of the manager's decision on Friday morning.\n\nXhaka was booed by the home fans when he was substituted during Arsenal's dramatic win over Aston Villa on Sunday and a number of the club's supporters were clearly unimpressed with Firday's news.\n\nGranit Xhaka has been named Arsenal captain but a number of the clubs fans aren't pleased\n\n'I like Emery but Xhaka as captain is a disgrace and that will end up getting him sacked,' one fan commented on Twitter. 'Blokes not a footballer let alone club captain of Arsenal.'\n\n'We\u2019ve really fallen off,' wrote another alongside pictures of former captains Tony Adams, Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas and Patrick Vieira.\n\nIt didn't stop there with one fan sharing a picture of his season ticket in the bin and another suggesting the only person to vote for Xhaka in the players' vote was the man himself.\n\nEmery had held a secret dressing-room poll earlier this week in his search for a new leader after a raft of senior players left the club this summer.\n\nThe Spaniard introduced a pool of five players last season to share the responsibility of leading the squad, but that became depleted following the departures of Aaron Ramsey, Koscielny and Petr Cech.\n\nRob Holding and Mesut Ozil are part of the five-man leadership group, it is believed, and the English defender revealed that system will remain in place.\n\nSpeaking after his first Arsenal appearance since December 2018 in the Carabao Cup in midweek, he said: 'He (Emery) likes his five captains. We all did a vote the other week so we'll see what happens and see who gets named.\n\n'It was just write names down and then give them to the manager and he will go through them obviously with his input and we'll see what happens.\n\n'I have no idea (when an announcement will be made), but there is a lot of leaders in that team who are helping each other out and pushing each other on.\n\n'Now that we've got these five captains that the manager has brought in it's spreading the leadership group rather than having one person to dictate it.\n\n'You're getting more input, it's generating a good environment.'", "description": "The under-fire Swiss midfielder has been given the armband following a consultation between Emery and his players with the squad being informed of the manager's decision on Friday morning.", "authors": ["Spencer Morgan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/15/19014910-0-image-a-33_1569596246593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
