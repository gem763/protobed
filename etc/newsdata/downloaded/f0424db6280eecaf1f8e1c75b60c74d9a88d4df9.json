It's not a traditional Irish music record, though it does draw heavily on tradition. But with its deep drones, from reed-based instruments such as the uilleann pipes, harmonium, concertina and more, The Livelong Day has much in common with electronic music to my ears. Artists such as Portishead and Brian Eno come to mind.\n\n\n\nIn this Guest DJ conversation, I talk with Radie Peat and Ian Lynch from the quartet Lankum about their new album and their unique brand of Irish music; they also share music they love by other artists, with a focus on contemporary Irish music by artists you likely haven't heard before.\n\n1. Lankum: \"Bear Creek\" from The Livelong Day\n\n(Note: This audio will be available when the album is released on Oct. 25)\n\n2.
