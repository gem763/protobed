But it \u2013 and suburbs like it \u2013 is also, Democrats say, \u201cground zero\u201d in the battle for the White House in 2020.\n\nWill swing voters who went from Obama to Trump stay loyal in 2020? Read more\n\n\u201cThese suburbs, even more than the rural parts of the state, were the pre-Trump base of the Republican party,\u201d said David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic party. \u201cIf all of a sudden Republicans are not able to run up the numbers in places like Westerville, that is a very real obstacle on their prior path to victory.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Democrats won the House majority in a \u201csuburban revolt\u201d led by women and powered by a disgust of Donald Trump\u2019s race-based attacks, hardline policy agenda and chaotic leadership style. From the heartland of Ronald Reagan conservatism in Orange county, California, to a coastal South Carolina district that had not elected a Democrat to the seat in 40 years, Democrats swept once reliably Republican suburban strongholds.\n\nIn Ohio, Democrats lost a fiercely contested governor\u2019s race but made gains in the state house for the first time in nearly a decade, all of which came in suburban districts, including one that covers Westerville.\n\nDemocrats see this trend moving more sharply in their direction in 2020, spurred by a confluence of the president\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior as he faces impeachment, growing economic anxiety and rising frustration over inaction on gun control after a string of mass shootings, including in Dayton, Ohio, where a gunman killed nine people in 32 seconds.\n\nThere is no way Democrats win without doing really well in suburbs Lanae Erickson\n\n\u201cThere is no way Democrats win without doing really well in suburbs,\u201d said Lanae Erickson, a senior vice-president at Third Way, a centrist Democratic thinktank.\n\nShe said suburban voters, and particularly well-educated women, are repulsed by Trump\u2019s hardline immigration agenda that separates families and his racist attacks on congresswomen of color. But neither are they looking for \u201ca far-left socialist takeover\u201d, she said, warning that Democrats risk overreaching on policy by embracing a single-payer healthcare system and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.\n\n\u201cTrump is making Democrats\u2019 job easier in the suburbs,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what really delivered these pickups in 2018 was a focus on kitchen table issues like healthcare, housing affordability and education.\u201d\n\nTrump and Republicans have made clear their 2020 strategy is to brand the Democratic field as dangerous \u201csocialists\u201d as a way of hurting their advantage with swing voters wary of the president.\n\nWhile Trump has found success by driving up support in less densely populated and rural areas, some Republicans have questioned the long-term durability of this strategy.\n\nAfter Democrats won the House in 2018, Eric Cantor, the former Republican House majority leader, called on Republicans to put forward a \u201csuburban agenda\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that some of the loss in support this year from college-educated women, for example, is a result of the negative opinion these voters have of President Trump,\u201d he wrote in the New York Times. \u201cBut it is also true that Republicans have not had much to offer suburban voters on what they consistently say are their top issues, including health care, child care, education, the environment and transportation.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, voters in the Richmond suburbs of the district Cantor once represented elected the moderate Democrat and political newcomer Abigail Spanberger.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe residents of Westerville, as in many of the suburbs where voters are turning against Republicans, are wealthier, whiter and more educated than the state as a whole.\n\nBut the suburbs are changing. They are becoming more diverse and more economically and racially stratified. The rate of poverty in the suburbs is now higher than in many urban areas, a majority of adult residents do not have a college degree and more than a third are minorities.\n\nA central feature of the ideological debate shaping the Democratic primary is over which candidate can best reconcile the economic interests of wealthy, white professionals and poorer and nonwhite liberals.\n\nThere are short-term political gains for Democrats in winning over suburban voters but that doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to progressive policies Lily Geismer\n\nLily Geismer, a historian at Claremont McKenna College and the author of Don\u2019t Blame Us: Suburban Liberals and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, argues that there is a \u201cpolicy cost\u201d to an electoral approach that prioritizes voters in well-educated, white suburban areas, and particularly women.\n\n\u201cThere are short-term political gains for Democrats in winning over suburban voters but that doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to progressive policies,\u201d she said. In her research, Geismer found that many suburban Democrats supported a national liberal agenda while opposing measures that challenged economic inequality in their own neighborhoods.\n\nIt\u2019s why, she said, two of the most liberal states in the nation \u2013 Maryland and Massachusetts \u2013 re-elected Republican governors in 2018. Similarly, voters in states such as California and Washington, which have prided themselves on leading the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda, rejected progressive ballot measures that would have respectively imposed aggressive rent controls and a tax on carbon pollution.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nDemocrats\u2019 arrival in Ohio has revived a simmering debate over Ohio\u2019s status as the nation\u2019s most reliable bellwether. No president since John F Kennedy has won without winning Ohio. But the state has not kept pace with the demographic changes transforming the country, resulting in an electorate that has grown increasingly older, whiter and less educated than the rest of the nation.\n\nIn 2016, Trump won the state by 8.5 percentage points \u2013 the widest margin of any swing state even as Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by 1.2 percentage points.\n\n\u201cOhio being selected as a debate site is a nice consolation prize. But don\u2019t mistake it as a fundamental shift in the 2020 political map,\u201d Bret Larkin, the former editorial director of the Plain Dealer, wrote in an op-ed. \u201cAnd Ohioans should not expect to see much of the party\u2019s nominee in the crucial months of next August, September and October.\u201d\n\nBut Pepper, the Ohio Democratic party chair, believes a Republican reckoning in the suburbs gives Democrats a \u201creal shot\u201d at winning Ohio in 2020.\n\nSeveral recent polls have indicated bad news for the president in the state. A recent Emerson poll of Ohio voters found that Trump\u2019s approval rating in Ohio hovered at 43% with a disapproval of 51%, mirroring his national approval rating. Meanwhile, 47% of Ohio voters said they supported impeachment, compared with 43% who said they did not. The survey also found that in a hypothetical general election matchup, Trump would lose the state to the leading Democratic candidates \u2013 former vice-president Joe Biden, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nKyle Kondik, political analyst at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics and author of The Bellwether: Why Ohio Picks the President, said the state reflects the political realignment taking place across the country: voters in the parts of the state that are highly educated and increasingly diverse are turning toward Democrats while working-class white voters continue their migration to the Republican party.\n\nBut in Ohio \u2013 as in the critical battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 many political observers believe Trump\u2019s fate might still rest in the hands of the white working-class voters who lifted him to the White House in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe state is not \u2018unwinnable\u2019 for Democrats, but improvement in the suburbs isn\u2019t sufficient to do it,\u201d Kondik wrote in an email. \u201cThe Democrats will have to cut into the Republican margins outside big urban [and] suburban areas as well.\u201d", "description": "Democrats swept the House in 2018 in a \u2018suburban revolt\u2019 \u2013 and there\u2019s \u2018no way\u2019 they could win the presidency without keeping the trend, experts say", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f41da08cf8b0a0072172204adbbad2ed68808778/0_124_4195_2518/master/4195.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa2d48bedaa2cb7d6df1dbef02f307e7", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
