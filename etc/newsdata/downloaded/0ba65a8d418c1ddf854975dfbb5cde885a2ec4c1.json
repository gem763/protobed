This is a serious missed opportunity by Facebook.\u201d\n\nThis came after Facebook said it is not the job of a tech company to \u201creferee political debate.\u201d\n\nThe comments, from former British Liberal Democrat leader and arch-Europhile Nick Clegg, now a VP at Facebook, were a rare moment of self-restraint for the company. They were published in full on Facebook\u2019s official blog.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe, however, that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,\u201d said Clegg. \u201cThat\u2019s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program. We have had this policy on the books for over a year now, posted publicly on our site under our eligibility guidelines. This means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review.\u201d\n\nHowever, Clegg added that even this voluntary policy of restraint has its limits, stating that the company would suppress posts from politicians in some circumstances.\n\n\u201cWhen a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements,\u201d said Clegg.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
