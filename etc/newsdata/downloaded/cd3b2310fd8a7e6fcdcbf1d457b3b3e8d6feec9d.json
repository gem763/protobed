In most jurisdictions it is far better equipped with tools to identify and mitigate risks arising in the banking and insurance sectors than in market based finance,\" Cunliffe said.\n\n\"This gap needs in my view to be addressed.\"\n\nCunliffe said any reworking of the relationship between the BoE and Britain's finance ministry to provide more help to the economy must be handled very cautiously.\n\nResponding to questions after his speech, he also said it was too early to say that more coordination between monetary and fiscal policy was needed.\n\nEarlier on Monday the finance ministry said rules for the budget will be reviewed and that they would \"keep control of our national debt\".\n\n\"Whether and how monetary, and perhaps fiscal, frameworks should adapt to a world of structurally low interest rates is a related but separate issue which is receiving considerable attention from academic research and, more recently, policy makers in some jurisdictions,\" Cunliffe said.\n\n\"Discussion is at a relatively early stage and these are, in my view, issues that would need a great deal of careful deliberation.\"\n\nOn Brexit, Cunliffe pushed back against the widespread view among economists outside the BoE that it would almost certainly be forced to cut interest rates in the event of a no-deal Brexit to help prop up demand.\n\n\"What we do doesn't always get reflected in what people think,\" Cunliffe said in response to a question after his speech, adding that some people had not expected the BoE would raise rates, as it has done, before any Brexit transition deal.\n\nOn Friday BoE Governor Mark Carney said it was his view that the BoE would do \"whatever we can\" to support growth in such a Brexit outcome.", "description": "BoE's Cunliffe moots more bank capital firepower for downturns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9D15B_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
