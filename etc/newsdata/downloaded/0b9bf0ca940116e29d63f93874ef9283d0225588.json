She never liked anybody. She never asked to see the children. But I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t meet her, because she would have criticised them, like she criticised me.\u201d\n\nElton added: \"She couldn\u2019t help herself.

And I just said, \u2018I love you, Mum,\u2019 and she said, \u2018I love you, too. I don\u2019t like you, but I love you. But I don\u2019t like you.\u2019\"\n\nWhen it came to regrets in life, Elton said that trying and then getting hooked on cocaine in 1974, was his main one.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n(Image: Maxppp/PA Images)\n\nHe said that after taking it for the first time, he was sick but that didn't stop him from coming back for more.\n\nElton admitted: \"It nearly destroyed my soul.\n\n\"My soul was black, like a charred piece of steak, until I said, \u2018I need help.\u2019 And suddenly a little pilot light in my soul came along going, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still here.\u2019\"\n\nIt has been 29 years since Elton 'cleaned up' and he revealed that he had written his memoir, Me, to help his sons understand the truth about his life.\n\n(Image: Getty Images for EJAF)\n\nElton continued: \"I wanted my boys to know what I was like and what happened, so that when I\u2019m not here, they can read the book and read the truth.\n\n\"I just want them to understand what I was like when I went through the journey I had before I had them. How they made my life complete.\n\n\"How they\u2019ve, you know, finished the circle. And that, you know, they were the last chapter in an incredible life.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
