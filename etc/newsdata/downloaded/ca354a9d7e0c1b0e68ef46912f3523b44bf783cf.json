Nordic Diet: Which Is Best?", "language": "en", "text": "Searching for a diet that provides not only spectacular health benefits but also delicious food? Look no further than the Mediterranean diet. But there\u2019s a \u201cnew\u201d diet in town that boasts even bigger benefits \u2013 is it the \u201creal deal\u201d? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet isn\u2019t really a \u201cdiet.\u201d It\u2019s the way Europeans have been eating for centuries. Their diets are naturally rich in fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, grains, fish, and healthy fats like avocados and olive oil. Refined carbohydrates, processed foods, and sugary foods are eaten minimally or avoided altogether.\n\nAs a result, those who follow the Mediterranean diet tend to be healthier and less prone to obesity and chronic conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. One study revealed, \u201cadherence to the Mediterranean diet seems to be a factor importantly associated with a better health-related quality of life.\u201d Research has also shown some degree of protection against cognitive decline and dementia.\n\nThe key components of the Mediterranean include:\n\nFresh, high-quality (preferably organic) vegetables and fruit\n\nWild-caught fish (salmon particularly)\n\nWhole, unrefined grains (typically wheat and farro)\n\nOlive oil\n\nNuts, beans, and legumes\n\nFermented dairy products like Greek yogurt and kefir, and cheese in moderation\n\nRed meat can be part of the Mediterranean diet, but typically only a few times a month. Eggs and poultry are also fine, about once a week.\n\nWhen it comes to flexibility, this diet is hard to beat.\n\nGetting started isn\u2019t difficult either. The easiest way to dive right in is to switch out vegetable and canola oils for healthier options like olive and avocado oils. Also replace one or two red meat-based dinners per week for cold-water fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, halibut, or trout. And if you want to indulge in a glass or two of alcohol (which is perfectly acceptable with this diet!), choose heart-healthy red wine over beer or hard liquor.\n\nBest of all, you don\u2019t even have to give up sweets, as long as you limit them to once per week (or less frequently, if you\u2019re able).\n\nThe popularity of the Mediterranean diet has spawned some \u201ccopycat\u201d diets\u2014some good, some not worth trying. There is one, though, that deserves a second look.\n\nThe Mediterranean\u2019s Diet\u2019s \u201cCold-Climate Cousin\u201d\n\nOften described as the cold-climate version of the Mediterranean diet, the Nordic diet has gained traction over the past several years. It definitely has a lot of pros\u2014and one notable con.\n\nGet My FREE Blood Sugar Report The Drug-Free Diabetes Cure\n\nThe Nordic diet was developed about 15 years ago by various medical professionals in Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, etc.), to encourage people to abandon Western eating habits and instead consume more seasonal, fresh, locally grown foods. It shares a lot of similarities to the Mediterranean diet, but with more of a focus on regional cuisine. And when it comes to health benefits, the Nordic diet, like its southern counterpart, has been shown to reduce risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and fight obesity.\n\nNutritionally speaking, the Nordic diet\u2019s main focus is plant-based foods\u2014fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes. But instead of warm-weather produce like tomatoes and eggplants, the Nordic diet serves up fruits and veggies that grow and thrive in chillier climates, like root vegetables (turnips, beets, carrots, etc.), apples, and pears.\n\nAs with the Mediterranean diet, protein-rich fish is a Nordic staple. Salmon, mackerel, and herring are abundant in the cold, clean waters that surround these countries, making them easily accessible and low in pollutants and toxins.\n\nGrains included in the Nordic diet include barley, rye, and oats. And while dairy like Greek yogurt is encouraged in the Mediterranean diet, those on the Nordic diet enjoy skyr, which is cultured and produced differently than Greek (and other) yogurts and has a thicker consistency.\n\nThe Nordic diet also limits processed foods, sweets, and red meat\u2014all boons for your health.\n\nFor all these benefits, there is one major drawback to the Nordic diet.\n\nWhile the Mediterranean diet is rich in olives and olive oil as a source of heart-healthy fats, the Nordic diet uses canola oil because the rapeseed plant (from which canola oil is made) is an abundant crop in that region.\n\nBy now, it\u2019s pretty well known that canola oil isn\u2019t the healthiest oil you can choose. It is high in omega-6 fatty acids. While omega-6s are important in moderation, most Americans consume them in excess. This is problematic because omega-6s are inflammatory in nature, and too much in the system can lead to chronic inflammation and, eventually, inflammatory conditions (i.e. diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, etc.). This is why sticking to olive oil\u2014high in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids\u2014is a much healthier way to go.\n\nWhich Diet Is Right for You?\n\nHere\u2019s the great news\u2014overall, the Mediterranean and the Nordic diets are both excellent, sustainable choices. You can adapt both by focusing on eating locally-grown, seasonal foods and changing things up with each new season. Your diet may end up being more \u201cNordic\u201d in the autumn and winter and more \u201cMediterranean\u201d in the spring and summer (or the other way around, depending on where you live). Either way, you\u2019re still following an eating plan that benefits your health in multiple ways.\n\nThe only caveat: Forgo the canola oil and choose olive or avocado oils for your cooking, baking, and marinating.\n\nReference\n\nSanchez P et al.
