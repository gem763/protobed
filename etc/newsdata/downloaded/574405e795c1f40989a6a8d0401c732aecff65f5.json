She angrily told her advisers: 'I'm the leader of the Conservative Party, not a presidential candidate. I'm not comfortable. I don't want it to be about me.'\n\nOne former aide told Sir Anthony: 'She was a terrible campaigner. She came across as grumpy, entitled and expecting to win.'\n\nThe book \u2013 May at 10 \u2013 serialised in The Times from today, describes how the former PM ignored warnings about the popularity of some of her key election pledges.\n\nA 'distraught' Mrs May banged her fist on the table and personally insisted her social care reform, dubbed the 'dementia tax', was included in the manifesto.\n\nHer advisers became 'so alarmed by May's state of mind' that one of her top aides was forced to become her 'minder' during the campaign, according to a book by Sir Anthony Seldon\n\nAnd she 'began to crumble' under the pressure of repeated attacks from her own supporters, which led to an unprecedented U-turn on a manifesto commitment. Although she wanted to ensure no one had to sell their home to pay for care, critics saw it as a way of using property values to fund social care.\n\nIt said bluntly that the elderly should not expect current and future taxpayers to pay for their care, adding: 'Many older people have built considerable property assets due to rising property prices.' Her senior aide Fiona Hill was sceptical of the policy, and 'foresaw what would happen'. Sir Anthony writes: 'It became the focus of her most bitter disagreement with [senior adviser Nick] Timothy during their time together in Number 10. May backed him.'\n\nMrs May worried she would present an 'empty manifesto' if she took out the social care reforms \u2013 and Miss Hill replied 'good'. But her two most trusted advisers being at loggerheads was too much for the prime minister.\n\nMay at 10 says the former prime minister had tears in her eyes during make-or-break decisions when her election plans began to go awry\n\nShe 'banged her fist on her desk, had tears in her eyes and was distraught', Sir Anthony writes. The author reserves special criticism for Mr Timothy, who co-wrote the manifesto behind closed doors 'with those best-equipped to communicate it not involved in its formation'.\n\nPolling guru Sir Lynton Crosby, who worked on elections with the past three Tory leaders, 'thought the entire document 'bullshit' and 'worse than useless'.'\n\nSir Anthony writes that 'the general election was the pivot of May's entire premiership' which saw the end of her ten-month 'extended honeymoon' since becoming PM in July 2016.\n\nBut her 'dithering' over calling the election, coupled with 'her fear of losing the office she craved so deeply', meant she 'froze' in the spotlight.\n\nInitial polls saw the Tories expected to win by a landslide, but a 'divided' campaign soured the mood in Conservative campaign headquarters.\n\nHer subsequent U-turn on the 'dementia tax' was also mishandled, he writes. 'It was her biggest test of leadership and character to date. She either had to hold her nerve or retrace her steps with candour and style. She did neither. She failed to step up.'", "description": "A new account of Theresa May's brief tenure at No 10 portrays a leader 'riddled with anxiety about herself' who was 'unable to find the words that speak to the nation'.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/02/20204330-0-image-a-29_1572051667620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
