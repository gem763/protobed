But there\u2019s a catch. They have to go through the company first.\n\n\u201cAny former NBC News employee who believes that they cannot disclose their experience with sexual harassment as a result of a confidentiality or non-disparagement provision in their separation agreement should contact NBCUniversal and we will release them from that perceived obligation,\u201d an NBCUniversal spokesperson told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Friday.\n\nHuffPost has reached out to NBC for further information on how that process would work, and whether it can guarantee there would be no retaliation against those seeking exceptions to their agreements.\n\nNEWS: NBCUniversal offers to release \"any former NBC News employee who believes that they cannot disclose their experience with sexual harassment\" because of an NDA \"from that perceived obligation.\" pic.twitter.com/zr2dewKDmR \u2014 Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog) October 26, 2019\n\nThe announcement came shortly before Maddow\u2019s interview with The New Yorker\u2019s Ronan Farrow, who left NBC News in 2017 to join the magazine where he reported his months-long investigation into sexual abuse allegations against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nIn Farrow\u2019s new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d he alleges that NBC had attempted to block his work on the Weinstein story \u2015 which he had started while working for the network \u2015 and covered up sexual assault allegations against former \u201cToday\u201d show anchor Matt Lauer. The book also contains explosive new details about the claims of former NBC News employee Brooke Nevils, who has accused Lauer of raping her in a hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nIn a memo obtained by several media outlets earlier this month, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim accused Farrow of engaging in an \u201ceffort to defame NBC News,\u201d arguing that the network has \u201cno secrets and nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with Maddow, Farrow gave NBC credit for its latest move, stating that the company\u2019s executives \u201cdeserve praise\u201d for offering to relax the agreements and that \u201cit should be a model for other companies.\u201d", "description": "Former employees may be released from the agreements if they have faced sexual harassment, but not before talking to the company.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db45ae2200000cc27506dc5.jpeg?cache=nidalz6xh5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
