Bickering bidders for Just Eat face a similar hazard if they fail to focus on what shareholders in the UK food delivery group care about most: a better offer.\n\nThe battle for Just Eat was always likely to turn nasty after Prosus, the 103 billion euro internet investor recently spun off from South Africa\u2019s Naspers, last week launched a 4.9 billion pound cash offer for the leaderless UK company. It trumped an all-share agreed offer from Dutch rival Takeaway.com.\n\nThe messy relationship between Europe\u2019s would-be food delivery kings \u2013 Prosus boss Bob van Dijk and his Takeaway.com counterpart Jitse Groen - has since produced a disorderly sideshow. Cat Rock Capital, which owns about 3% of Just Eat, on Monday accused van Dijk of helping drive down his rival\u2019s share price before launching his own bid. The investor pointed to last month\u2019s decision by Delivery Hero, which is part-owned by Prosus, to sell shares in Takeaway.com \u201cin a bizarre and uneconomic fashion\u201d. This had the effect of lowering the suitor\u2019s offer for Just Eat, now worth about 4.2 billion pounds.\n\nDelivery Hero and Prosus denied the accusation. Despite having 22% stakes, Prosus said it does not control its German affiliate\u2019s investment decisions. Besides, Delivery Hero had no knowledge of its shareholders\u2019 plans to bid for the UK company.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be suspicious of the timing of Delivery Hero\u2019s sale. However, the German group announced its plans to sell in April, when the shares were trading at an all-time high, and before Takeaway.com launched its bid. Besides, the market value of food delivery companies has been falling as investors fret about the heavy cost of paying for deliveries. Shares in U.S.-listed GrubHub fell by as much 40% on Tuesday morning after it warned of slowing growth.\n\nThe spat risks distracting the bidders\u2019 attention from their main priority: wooing Just Eat investors. Shareholders currently have a choice between van Dijk\u2019s cash and Groen\u2019s all-share offer. However, with Just Eat shares trading at a 6% premium to the Prosus bid, investors are clearly expecting a better price. The risk for the warring bidders is that their target slips away.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - Unattended cooking is the leading cause of house fires.
