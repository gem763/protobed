David Cicilline (D-RI), who leads the antitrust subcommittee, called the document request an \u201cimportant milestone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect stakeholders to use this opportunity to provide information to the Committee to ensure that the Internet is an engine for opportunity for everyone, not just a select few gatekeepers,\u201d said Cicilline in a statement.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said the documents will give the committee a better idea of how the tech giants are using their market power and how Congress should respond.\n\n\u201cThe open Internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online. But there is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications,\u201d Nadler said.\n\nThe logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are seen in a combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS/File Photos More\n\nRepublicans on the committee have stressed the importance of keeping an open mind, until investigators reach a conclusion.\n\n\u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,\u201d said Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe committee is asking for communications to and from top executives at each company \u2014 including Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Larry Page, Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and others. Lawmakers want to see emails, texts, and encrypted messages, on a range of topics.\n\nThey ask each company to detail the marketshare of their platforms, products and services along with their top competitors and customers. The committee also asks for documents pertaining to antitrust issues, past litigation and investigations.\n\nIn a letter to Facebook, the committee asks for documents pertaining to the acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp and Onavo. Lawmakers also want to know about the decision to integrate Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\nIn the letter to Alphabet CEO Larry Page, the lawmakers demand information concerning the acquisitions of YouTube, DoubleClick, Android and others. Lawmakers also ask Alphabet CEO Larry Page several questions about Google\u2019s advertising practices and search results.\n\nLawmakers are looking for more information about a slew of Amazon acquisitions \u2014 including Audible, Whole Foods and Zappos. They also are probing the company\u2019s pricing, advertising policies and search rankings for products sold on the site.\n\nAccording to the letter sent to CEO Tim Cook, the committee appears most interested in Apple\u2019s app store.\n\nU.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Rep.
