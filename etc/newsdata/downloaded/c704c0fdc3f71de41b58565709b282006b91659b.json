It seems to born out of memories of old music videos that used animation and featured people with teased hair. By extension, anyone who remembers the video for Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBeat It,\u201d will find a cultural echo in the game\u2019s dance-offs between jacket-clad gangs and their rivals. No wonder the epigraph at the end of its credits says, \u201cLet\u2019s Pop!\u201d\n\nMixing elements of racing, rhythm and shooting games, \u201cSayonara Wild Hearts\u201d spins a disposable story (voiced by Queen Latifah) around a heartbroken young woman whose world is literally upended after a butterfly-like creature from another universe wakes her up one night and flips her room upside down. The otherworldly emissary hails from a place that was once ruled by three benevolent aracana \u2014 i.e. divine tarot cards \u2014 until \u201ca cursed arcana\u201d crossed the trio on the \u201castral highways.\u201d Backed by its \u201cstar-crossed\u201d conspirators, the dastardly arcana plundered the harmony from that universe and cached it in their corrupt hearts.\n\nTumbling outside the window of her room like loose change spilled from an overturned pocket, the woman alights on a skateboard that fell with her. Taking it all in as one might a dream, the heroine doesn\u2019t pause to adjust to her surroundings. Instead, she skates. The nocturnal road that uncoils in front of her is made up of lanes outlined in shimmering colors. The road spirals, twists, loops, and breaks off into sections which twirl through the air as discs before joining other segments. This is not a game that\u2019s hard to get into.\n\nAs a modernized version of Debussy\u2019s \u201cClair de lune\u201d plays, the woman zooms down the road and over jumps acquiring whatever hearts she rolls over, contributing to the player\u2019s final score. Gold, silver, and bronze ranks are awarded for obtaining a certain number of hearts per stage. At the end of her initial run, the woman falls from the road through the air. Ever the symbol of metamorphosis, the butterfly turns into a tarot card and then zaps the heroine so that her clothes are replaced with a mask and costume in a scene that\u2019s pure glam.\n\n\n\nSayonara Wild Hearts (Annapurna Interactive)\n\nThe next stage introduces the first of five \u201cheartbreak\u201d stages, spread across the game. Unlike later stages that introduce different adversaries, these stages are devoid of other people. The goal here, as elsewhere, is simply to acquire as many hearts as possible \u2014 whether surfing on a tarot card down a tight heart-shaped tunnel or piloting a boat through turbulent waters. Watching the levels contort themselves into different forms to accommodate different mechanics, such as top-down or side-scrolling shooting, is hypnotically satisfying.\n\nThe first adversaries you meet are the Dancing Devils, a motorcycle gang which engages you in a dance battle before hopping onto motorcycles and speeding away. Easily timed button presses will get you through the dance-off and help you to perform some acrobatic jumps off and back onto your motorcycle when you later chase the Dancing Devils. One of my favorite stages in the game is far more tricky in terms of timed events. In Parallel Universes you go after the Stereo Lovers on your motorcycle. This androgynous pair can float through the air and, with a snap of their fingers, change the layout of the road between two different states, each with different sets of obstacles. I loved the disorienting effect of trying to hold a picture of a vanished road in my mind in preparation for when it might reappear. #GhostRider.\n\n\n\nSayonara Wild Hearts (Annapurna Interactive)\n\nNone of the stages in \u201cSayonara Wild Hearts\u201d take longer than a few minutes to complete. Indeed, the game can easily be finished in under two hours on one\u2019s first attempt. That said, I\u2019ve played through it a few times now and I\u2019m nowhere near tired of it. Obtaining a gold ranking in each of the stages is far more challenging than just completing them since many of hearts required to get a high score are nestled among obstacles that require a bit of finesse to acquire.\n\n\u201cSayonara Wild Hearts\u201d is a concentrated blast of audiovisual delight \u2014 its minimalist graphics evokes an era where wire-frame graphics and on-the-rail shooters were dazzling technology. It is a game that excels in instilling an ephemeral sense of elation. It\u2019s obvious why the developers dubbed in a \u201cvideo game pop album.\u2019 It goes down easy and begs to be played repeatedly.\n\nChristopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.
