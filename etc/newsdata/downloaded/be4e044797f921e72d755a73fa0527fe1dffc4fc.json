In unison, the twin Trump tormentors declared that partisanship has infected the Justice Department and \u201cthe rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d\n\nDespite stiff competition from two centuries of congressional hypocrisy, that is a first-rate howler. If you can\u2019t laugh at Schiff and Nad\u00adler accusing anyone else of damaging the rule of law for partisan purposes, you don\u2019t have a sense of humor.\n\nThey have violated every historic precedent, not to mention simple decency, by conducting their impeachment probe in a secret star chamber. They leak juicy fragments to the media echo chamber, which would be a federal crime for real prosecutors.\n\nThen they squeal and gnash their teeth when the worm starts to turn.
