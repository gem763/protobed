The fate of those so-called credit default swaps (CDS) was at the heart of the battle over whether Thomas Cook lived or died.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe decision to trigger payouts on Thomas Cook CDS lies with a panel of traders called the Determinations Committee. The group was due to meet on Monday to debate whether the Chapter 15 US bankruptcy filing by Thomas Cook last week is sufficient for payment. Now, it has also been asked to assess Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation.\n\nCDS are a popular way for hedge funds to bet on companies facing financial difficulties. They don\u2019t always pay out in the event of default, however.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Holders of CDS were concerned about a technicality related to plans to convert Thomas Cook debt into shares, which would have left the CDS with nothing to insure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a relief for the hedge funds that Thomas Cook has filed and they haven\u2019t had to push the company into administration,\u201d said Marc Pierron, a senior analyst at Spread Research.\n\nIf rescue talks hadn\u2019t collapsed over the weekend and the hedge funds had undermined them to ensure a payout, it would have added to criticism of the CDS market.\n\nRegulators are already keeping an eye out for so-called manufactured credit events, when funds entice companies to miss bond payments they could otherwise make.\n\nThomas Cook will be the latest of several big payouts this year for hedge funds and traders who bought CDS. The list includes retailer New Look and Rallye, parent of French supermarket chain Casino Guichard-Perrachon. More are set to follow as Europe\u2019s economy slows and a growing number of companies come under stress.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "It is hard to see any silver lining in the collapse of Thomas Cook, which has left 21,000 people facing almost certain redundancy and the government on the hook for repatriating the firm\u2019s British customers.
