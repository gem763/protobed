Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks to more than 20,000 supporters during a campaign event in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park on Monday night. (Craig Ruttle/AP)\n\nThe battle began on the first full day of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, when the newly elected president instructed his minions to publicly exaggerate the size of his inauguration crowds.\n\nThe fight raged on as Trump continued to obsess and fret over crowd size \u2014 boasting, touting and sometimes inflating his own adoring masses at campaign rallies and presidential events.\n\nThen finally this week, the Democrats \u2014 who have long tried to ignore Trump\u2019s bigger-is-better ethos \u2014 offered a tangible response of their own in the form of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Monday evening rally in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park, where the senator from Massachusetts showed that she, too, could match the spectacle of Trump, right down to the large cheering throngs.\n\n\u201cYeah, the lines keep getting longer,\u201d Warren told reporters in New York on Tuesday, when asked about the four-hour wait for photos with her that capped her Monday rally, which was attended by more than 20,000 people. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing!\u201d\n\nOnce widely regarded as an interesting but ultimately inconsequential novelty of political campaigns, crowd size is now a potentially meaningful metric of electability \u2014 one that can translate into volunteers, donors and, as Trump demonstrated in 2016, actual momentum. Ever since, Trump has consistently drawn large audiences to his rallies, many of them held in less populated parts of the country and attracting supporters who often drive hours, across multiple states, to attend.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday en route to California, Trump rejected the significance of Warren\u2019s Monday night masses \u2014 and with no evidence rebutted her crowd count \u2014 saying that \u201canybody\u201d can attract crowds \u201cstanding in the middle of Manhattan in the most densely populated area of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get these crowds in areas that nobody\u2019s ever seen crowds before,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cPretty amazing. Certainly if I went to Manhattan, if I went there \u2014 number one, she didn\u2019t have 20,000 people, and number two, I think anybody would get a good crowd there.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the multitudes who gathered after a light rain to hear Warren\u2019s plan to fix what she describes as systematic corruption \u2014 and to cheer her rebuke of Trump as \u201ccorruption in the flesh\u201d \u2014 provided clear evidence that Warren, even in a Democratic primary, can compete on the same terms as a president who revels in crowd size above almost all else.\n\n\n\nWarren takes the stage before addressing supporters at Monday\u2019s rally. (Craig Ruttle/AP)\n\n\u201cBig, structural change in Washington Square Park with @ewarren,\u201d tweeted Warren communications director Kristen Orthman, captioning a photo of the park\u2019s marble arch overflowing with Warren supporters \u2014 so many specks of frozen fervor \u2014 and glowing incandescent in the moonlight.\n\nThe missive captured Warren\u2019s pitch of major government and corporate overhaul but also seemed a clear allusion to her crowd size, which New York City\u2019s park service initially expected to number between 8,000 and 10,000 people before more than doubling those early estimates.\n\n'Hours and hours'\n\nWarren\u2019s crowds show \u201cthat not only does she have broad reach \u2014 she has broad enthusiasm,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a liberal strategist who hasn\u2019t endorsed a candidate in the presidential primary. To defeat Trump in the general election, she said, Democrats will need to nominate someone who generates the same excitement \u2014 pointing to the long line of Warren supporters who waited until nearly midnight for photos of her as one indication of her appeal.\n\n\u201cThey were staying at her events for hours and hours after she finished,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about raising money and electability, but there\u2019s nothing nearly as important to winning in 2020 as voter enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nTo Warren supporters, too, the overwhelming crowd size was meaningful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so democratizing for a major presidential candidate to stand and wait for all the people who obviously want to see her,\u201d gushed Devon Racinelli, 25, who was last in one of two lines that formed for photos with Warren on Monday night. The wait was so long that he had attended the rally, went to dinner and then returned for the picture.\n\nThe size of the crowd also inspired some to view a Warren candidacy as truly viable.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the crowds turn out, and you see the energy and what she has to say, you realize that the message can start to reverberate,\u201d said Townsend Barber, 45, a student at New York University.\n\nIn some ways, both Trump and Warren are making similar appeals to fiery populism, but with very different approaches. Warren\u2019s supporters chant \u201cTwo cents!\u201d \u2014 a shorthand for her proposed annual wealth tax on those with fortunes over $50 million \u2014 while Trump\u2019s crowds cheer \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d in reference to his promised border barrier.\n\nThose who attend Warren events also tend to file in shortly before she starts speaking and then stay hours afterward for a photo. Many of Trump\u2019s backers, meanwhile, come hours early \u2014 including some who camp out the night before \u2014 but then sometimes trickle out early as the president is still speaking.\n\nFor years the conventional wisdom among campaign strategists was that big crowds don\u2019t matter much in actually turning out voters, but the 2016 campaign cycle scrambled that assumption. Now key Democrats in Iowa, which holds the first primary contest, are keeping a careful watch.\n\n\n\nWarren supporters cheer as she arrives at the New York rally Monday. (Craig Ruttle/AP)\n\n\u201cEveryone is obsessed with finding the most \u2018electable\u2019 candidate, but no one really knows what that means,\u201d said Zach Simonson, the chair of the Wapello County Democrats in Iowa who was impressed with Warren\u2019s New York event. \u201cFor a lot of people, part of electability is seeing that a candidate can generate excitement and draw big crowds. Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t really do that last time; Trump does in a way Republicans usually don\u2019t. Taking back some of that populist momentum would be huge.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also pulled in massive crowds for his Democratic presidential run. At the time, Clinton\u2019s supporters played down his strength.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton supporters were the ones saying crowds don\u2019t matter\u201d in 2016, said Patti Solis Doyle, who ran Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cWhen you have the ability to get 20,000 at a rally, it is significant, and your opponents should be concerned.\u201d\n\nSanders continues to draw some sizable rally crowds, including about 10,000 at a recent event in Denver, and aides like to post pictures of his more impressive crowds on social media. But in other settings, his attendance has been more inconsistent. His first stop on a college tailgate tour in Iowa one Sunday afternoon this month drew an underwhelming number of attendees.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) attracted an estimated 20,000 people to Oakland for her campaign kickoff rally but nothing that big since then. Former vice president Joe Biden, who has the highest name recognition among the Democratic primary field, has so far favored smaller-scale events.\n\n'It was noticed'\n\nAlex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked as a senior adviser on the 2016 presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said it was initially difficult to know how much weight to give to Trump\u2019s massive crowds, in part because he often eschewed events in traditional early-voting states in favor of large rallies in Republican strongholds such as Alabama and Georgia. Trump also held events in solidly Democratic states, like Massachusetts.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump arrives at a rally in Rio Rancho, N.M., on Monday night. (George Etheredge/Bloomberg News)\n\n\u201cTrump would go have the greatest show in town, and it was hard to tell how many people were turning out because they supported him versus just coming for the free entertainment,\u201d Conant said. \u201cEveryone was late to appreciate the seriousness of his candidacy, but once he started winning places, it became apparent that people weren\u2019t just turning out because he put on a great show, but there was real support there.\u201d\n\nConant added that, like Trump, Warren is drawing her biggest crowds not in early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire but in Democratic strongholds like St. Paul, Minn., and Manhattan.\n\nBut, he said, \u201cit is an indication that there is widespread support and deeper enthusiasm for her than there is for some of the candidates. If you\u2019re going to go to the trouble to show up at an event, you\u2019re probably going to vote, and you\u2019re more likely to donate or talk to your neighbors about voting, too.\u201d\n\nTrump allies say that while Warren\u2019s supporters may have provided an impressive showing this week, the events by her and other Democrats still pale in comparison to the overflow crowds the president regularly addresses.\n\nOn Monday, for example, the president held a large campaign rally in Rio Rancho, N.M. \u2014 a state that Clinton, as the Democratic presidential nominee, won by more than eight percentage points.\n\n\u201cEvery venue President Trump visits reaches capacity, frequently setting individual venue attendance records, with overflow crowds remaining outside to watch on big screens,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in an email statement. \u201cThere\u2019s no movement of this magnitude in modern political history.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s no great feat for a leftist to attract people in Manhattan or Seattle and it probably took Warren\u2019s campaign weeks of planning to do even that.\u201d\n\nStill, one Republican operative in frequent touch with the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment, noted that for all the dismissiveness, Trump himself did pay attention to Warren\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIt was noticed by the fire marshal in chief,\u201d the operative quipped.\n\nLinskey reported from New York.
