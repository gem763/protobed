The fund offers education and coaching to help struggling young people build the confidence and skills necessary to escape the clutches of homelessness.\n\nEnd Youth Homelessness Employability Campaign. Courtesy of Jack\n\nThis Autumn, Walala and the EYH employability campaign have designed 120 bold billboards spanning nationwide, with 60 designated to London sites and the other 60 located in Glasgow, Cardiff, Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh and Sheffield.\n\nEYH is the first nationwide initiative tackling the crisis of homelessness in the UK. Supporting more than 30,000 young people each year, the organisation gives them support, housing and educational opportunities.\n\nNOW GALLERY WALALA X PLAY Camille Walala\n\nWalala\u2019s work is crucial to the concept. Drawing on a previous work involving a maze-like playground at NOW GALLERY, this project mirrors the obstacles faced by young people who are being let down by the system. Whilst the harsh black lines mimic the barriers excluding them from gaining good education and safe spaces, the vibrancy of colour evokes a redeeming path to safety without dead ends. What\u2019s more, the work is characterised by an optimistic message that speaks for itself, \u201chelp them find their way.\u201d\n\nWalala comments on the project, saying \u201cmy work has always been driven by my belief that colour and pattern can make a positive difference to people's lives. It\u2019s a privilege to have the opportunity to put that philosophy into practice for such an important initiative as End Youth Homelessness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be involved \u2013 it means a lot to me,\u201d she concludes.\n\nWho is Camille Walala?\n\nCamille Walala\u2019s background is not what you might expect from a prominent designer. She studied textile design at university, but found her footing when a former colleague asked if she would sell her designs in his wife\u2019s shop. This was no art and design store, it was in fact a cheesemonger, but this made no difference to the young, aspiring designer who jumped at the chance to be able to sell her own work. From there, Camille\u2019s career took off and she caught her first big break designing a \u201cWalala playground\u201d for trendy Shoreditch club, XOYO.\n\nXOYO Camille Walala\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never done anything like that before\u201d Camille says. \u201cIt gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. I did these massive slogans and patterns everywhere, huge black and white stripes. I remember going inside and seeing all these people having the best time and it looked so good. I was so happy.\u201d\n\nBETTER BANKSIDE Camille Walala\n\nFollowing XOYO, Walala was inundated with projects, brand collaborations, installations and even a zebra crossing design . Inspired by the geometric and optical illusions of the 60\u2019s movement \u2018Op art\u2019, Walala sees her art as encouraging people to not take themselves too seriously, imbuing her creations with humour and delight. Art should be enjoyed, she reflects, \u201cthe best exhibition I saw was Bridget Riley. I felt like a child again. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to create with my work \u2013 to have a really positive effect on someone.\u201d", "description": "Camille Malala is paving the way out of youth poverty with her hope inspiring design collaboration.", "authors": ["Kiltie De Cleyn"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/14/32/1000x563_cmsv2_c54bda01-b119-535d-8fd9-ebe638f316f8-4251432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
