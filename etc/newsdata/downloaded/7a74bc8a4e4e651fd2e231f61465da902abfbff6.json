It will be in the Atlanta area. Further details like the exact location and format will be announced in the future.\n\nCurrently, more than a dozen candidates are still short of the qualification thresholds, including four who will be on stage next week in Ohio: Juli\u00e1n Castro, Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O\u2019Rourke. Those four have all said they've cleared the 165,000 donor threshold required for the debate, but each needs at least three more 3-percent polls to qualify.\n\nIn the Quinnipiac poll, Warren and Biden are the two clear top-tier candidates. Warren has 29 percent to Biden's 26 percent. Sanders is the only other candidate in double-digits, coming in third at 16 percent.\n\nThe Quinnipiac University poll was conducted from Oct. 4-7 and surveyed 646 Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters. The margin of error is plus-or-minus 4.7 percentage points.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5d/02/a00444f1442ab20c460d0fa305ce/20191008-yang-debate-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
