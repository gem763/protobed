And then remember that these are among the biggest whoppers of the 2020 election. One side will do battle with the aid of a huge and savvy nonprofit political empire\u2014and it isn\u2019t the right. Though the sooner Republicans understand that, the better.\n\nA helpful tutorial arrived this week, \u201cPower Grab,\u201d a new book by Republican former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah. Mr. Chaffetz has been digging into nonprofits since his time as House Oversight Committee chairman, and the book details how powerful the liberal nonprofit sector has grown. It may surprise many Americans\u2014those who read daily stories about conservative \u201cinfluence\u201d\u2014that the likes of the NRA, Judicial Watch and the National Organization for Marriage barely rank by comparison to the assets and revenue of Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union or the Nature Conservancy.\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ: ACTIVISTS ARE WEAPONIZING CHARITABLE GIVING -- AND THAT MEANS BIG TROUBLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN\n\nThese aren\u2019t only big political players; they\u2019re the biggest political players. In 2018 the nonprofit watchdog Capital Research Center analyzed grants handed out in the 2014 election year by six big foundations on the right (including the Bradley and Charles Koch foundations) versus six on the left (including the Open Society and Tides foundations). Liberal public-policy charities, organized under chapter 501(c)(3) of the tax code, bagged $7.4 billion of this foundation money in 2014. For conservative charities, the figure was a mere $2.2 billion. That $7.4 billion also dwarfed total 2013-14 campaign receipts to federal, state and local campaigns ($4.1 billion) and spending that cycle by independent groups ($830 million).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMr. Chaffetz\u2019s contribution is to refocus attention on the way liberal charities channel their huge funds into political work that benefits the Democratic Party. We\u2019ve long known that some of them engage in nominally nonpartisan voter registration, conveniently only in places likely to yield Democratic votes. The Chaffetz book adds new data highlighting contracts between liberal charities and overt political organizations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING KIMBERLEY STRASSEL'S COLUMN IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL", "description": "It's time to look at the way liberal charities channel their huge funds into political work that benefits the Democratic Party.", "authors": ["Kimberley A.
