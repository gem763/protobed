Much of this information has major privacy implications.\"\n\nAlan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst at the consultancy TVrev, said he expects streaming ads to be less intrusive than those which follow users around the internet.\n\n\"The TV industry has learned from digital that people find that kind of advertising creepy,\" he said.\n\nWolk said streaming services are aiming for fewer ads compared with broadcast television that will be \"less painful\" for viewers because they are more relevant.\n\nAn apartment dweller, for example, might not be interested in a lawn care ad and a 24-year-old may be turned off by messages for retirement. And advertisers will pay more if they know their messages are being delivered to people interested in their products.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to be able to get fewer, better targeted ads that brands will pay more money for and consumers are happy to watch,\" Wolk said.\n\nLimits of targeting\n\nTargeting for television has limits, however. It is never really clear which member of a family is watching a specific show, or whether it is seen live or recorded.\n\nCharles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova University, said addressable TV advertising is on the rise, but that platforms are likely to be sensitive to consumer privacy concerns, and aware of new laws including a strict statute in California.\n\nThe California law, he said, \"won't allow marketers to build data management platforms where they are merging data form various sources.\"\n\nAs a result, Taylor said the targeting is likely to be \"behavioral,\" or based largely on viewing habits, without the detailed profiles that Facebook and Google use.\n\n\"Almost nobody would want health information shared; on the other hand most people don't mind more targeted ads based on their real preferences,\" Taylor said.\n\n2020 political ads\n\nAddressable TV advertising also opens up a new channel for political ads, potentially impacting spending in the 2020 US election campaign.\n\n\"I don't think there's any doubt this will play a role\" in the election campaign, Taylor said.\n\n\"The databases out there are pretty effective at knowing someone's political affiliation and a well-built data management platform should be able to give you a good idea of which voters might potentially be swayed.\"\n\nMark Jablonowski, managing partner at the digital ad consultancy DSPolitical, said these new platforms may not be able to get the kinds of details of internet services, but that they may still be useful for candidates.\n\n\"For now the platforms are well suited to geographical targeting -- which can be quite powerful in politics,\" Jablonowski said.\n\n\"Candidates running in 2020 would be smart to include these platforms in their media mix because, at the end of the day, political advertising is all about getting in front of voters wherever and whenever possible.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "In the new world of streaming television, advertising is not going away, but is evolving to become more like marketing on the internet -- targeted to specific groups or individuals.
