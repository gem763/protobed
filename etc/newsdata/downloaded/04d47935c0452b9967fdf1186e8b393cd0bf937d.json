Excluding automobile sales, the growth rate reached 9.1 percent.\n\nLocal governments are planning to gradually lift vehicle purchase restrictions and announce measures to promote the consumption of used cars and new energy vehicles, said Zhao Ping, a researcher with the Academy of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.\n\nShe noted that those policies could effectively ease the negative impact of automobile sales on consumption growth.\n\nIt is essential to remove institutional barriers and accelerate innovation in system and mechanism to transform consumption potential into tangible purchasing power, Chen said.", "description": "As consumption continued to be the main engine of China's economic growth, the country is stepping up efforts to create a favorable environment to further unleash consumption potential.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db9490da310cf3e97a390eb.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
