Instead, the firm says that Tether \u201cissued extraordinary amounts of unbacked USDT to manipulate cryptocurrency prices.\u201d The document reads:\n\n\u201cBecause the market believed the lie that one USDT equaled one U.S. dollar, Bitfinex and Tether had the power to, and did, manipulate the market on an unprecedented scale to profit from boom-and-bust cycles they created.\u201d\n\nTether and Bitfinex expected the lawsuit\n\nThe lawsuit filing comes two days after both Tether and Bitfinex published statements claiming that they had become aware of an unreleased paper \u201cfalsely positing that Tether issuances are responsible for manipulating the cryptocurrency market.\u201d Urging that the paper contained \u201cbaseless accusations,\u201d Tether and Bitfinex said that they will vigorously defend themselves if lawyers use the source to launch a lawsuit.", "description": "A New York-based legal firm filed a class-action suit against Tether and Bitfinex, accusing the firms of crypto market manipulation", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNTg1ZjllYzAxMmE3NGRjYjJmYTc0MzlmOWFkMDRiMzAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
