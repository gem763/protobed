Its absence was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nA person close to PayPal said it is concerned Facebook has not done enough to dissuade concerns the currency is susceptible to money-laundering, according to the FT. The Libra project is headed by David Marcus, who was previously PayPal president.\n\nEarlier this week, the Journal reported that Visa Inc. VISA, +2.44% , Mastercard Inc. MA, +2.15% , and other financial partners who agreed to back Libra were reconsidering their involvement.\n\nFacebook had no comment.\n\n\u201cEach organization that started this journey will have to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises,\u201d Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, told the Journal in an email.\n\nLibra Association members have each pledged to contribute $10 million to the project, which has faced blistering criticism from federal lawmakers on several fronts. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg have been asked to testify before the House Financial Services Committee about Libra, CNN and The Hill reported on Friday. A hearing with Sandberg could come as soon as this month; the committee is waiting to confirm a date with Zuckerberg to testify in a separate hearing, CNN reported, citing a congressional source.\n\nWhen Libra was unveiled in June, Facebook described it as an easy, inexpensive way for consumers to transmit money globally via digital wallets on their smartphones without the need for a bank. An independent, third-party organization, the Libra Association, would govern the currency.\n\nBut the project drew immediate blowback from regulators around the world over concerns it might undercut government-backed currencies, threaten consumer privacy, and be a boon for the financing of drugs, terrorism and other illegal activities.\n\nIn contentious testimony before the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees in July, Marcus assured lawmakers that Facebook and the Libra Association would address all regulatory concerns.\n\nRead more: Senate releases testimony of Facebook exec before Libra hearing Tuesday\n\nThey were not convinced.\n\n\u201dI think that he [Marcus] skirted some of the most significant questions,\u201d Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV following the testimony. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, I don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d\n\nWaters called on Zuckerberg to testify on the project.\n\nFB shares were marginally higher in after-hours trading Friday after closing up 0.6%. Shares are up 37% in the year to date. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.42% is up 17% in the year to date.", "description": "In what could be a lethal blow to Facebook Inc.\u2019s controversial Libra project, PayPal Holdings Inc. is reportedly on the verge of withdrawing its support for...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS725_Marcus_ZG_20191004163929.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
