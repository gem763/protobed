Mrs Morgan\u2026. I love you,\u2019 he declared: \u2018Thank you for making me the luckiest man in the world\u2019 he said, posting a photo of the couple in their wedding outfits.\u2019\n\nThe Negan star added: \u2018Ok.

All untrue.\n\n\u2018But WE knew our truth. So it felt silly to try and correct anything. Here\u2019s the God\u2019s honest fact: From the moment I met @jeffreydeanmorgan, he was my husband.\n\nJeffrey called himself the luckiest man in the world (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Rather than make vows right out of the gate, we lived them. For over ten years. The good times and the bad. Standing up there with our children at our sides \u2013 celebrating all that has been \u2013 was bliss.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018I love you Jeffrey. I love our intimate group of friends and family who joined us. I love the various circles of loved ones who have supported us over the years.\n\n\u2018It was private and magical and everything I dreamed. So yeah.
