Wochit\n\nInstagram is following in the footsteps of its parent company Facebook by launching a separate app just for messaging.\n\nOn Thursday, Instagram introduced the world to Threads, a direct messaging platform that lets users privately swap photos and videos with \"close friends.\" The new Snapchat rival is positioned to help you stay connected with your best friends all day long, according to Instagram.\n\n\"We\u2019ve heard that you want an easier way to keep up with your friends throughout the day \u2013 especially when you don\u2019t have the time to send a photo or have a conversation,\" the photo-sharing app said in a blog post. Threads is supposed to be the \"fastest\" way to \"share what you\u2019re doing in just two taps.\"\n\nForbes 400: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett remain the richest people in the US\n\nAI bias: How tech determines if you land job, get a loan or end up in jail\n\nThe standalone app is introducing two primary features for iOS and Android users.\n\nOne feature lets you create a \"status\" so your friends know if you're studying or some other task that requires your attention. The other tool called \"Auto Status\" will use your location data to automatically share \"little bits of context on where you are without giving away your coordinates.\" For example, it can tell your friends if you're driving or at the gym.\n\nThreads offers a new, dedicated home for your private conversations. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nThe app also prevents you from getting DMs from random people by only including followers who appear in your Instagram Close Friends list.\n\n\"We hope that Threads can bring you a little closer to the people you care about,\" Instagram said.\n\n\"What happened to my Likes?\" Facebook hid them\n\nFor now, messages from your close friends list will appear in both the Threads app and your regular DMs. (Photo: Instagram)\n\nHow 'Threads' works\n\nWhen you launch the \"Threads from Instagram\" app for the first time you'll get to pick the people you're open to chatting with. Once you're all set up, your phone's camera will immediately open every time you launch the app, just like on Snapchat.\n\nAfter you snap a photo or a video, you can decide whether to share it with your entire Close Friends list or with specific people. Instagram stressed that the new app was created with privacy in mind, so everything is \"completely opt-in.\"\n\nBoth Instagram and Facebook are known for copying some of Snapchat's features. One of the most notable was the Stories format which quickly became popular among Instagram users. Stories disappear after a certain amount of time.\n\nFacebook also followed in Snapchat's footsteps when it introduced QR codes and selfie masks to users.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/04/instagram-launched-threads-messaging-app-works-like-snapchat/3862689002/", "description": "Instagram says that Threads is a new way to message with close friends in a dedicated, private space.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
