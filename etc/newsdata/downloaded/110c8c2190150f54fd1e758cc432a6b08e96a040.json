It is likely to decide on a similar EU request early in 2020.\n\nBoth sides have drawn up provisional lists of products they could hit with tariffs, to be fine-tuned after the decisions.\n\nU.S. $25 BILLION LIST\n\nThe United States issued a preliminary list in April that featured EU imports worth an annual $21 billion.\n\nThat list was split in two. Section one contains civil cargo and passenger planes and helicopters from the four Airbus producing countries - Britain, France, Germany and Spain.\n\nThe longer section two lists goods to be targeted from any of the 28 EU member countries.\n\nThey include fish and shellfish, citrus fruit, olive oil, juice, wine and a range of cheeses from cheddar and stilton to edam and Roquefort.\n\nHandbags, paper, yarn, carpets, clothing including sweaters and pyjamas, bed linen, ceramics, metals, cutlery, bicycle parts, wall clocks and artists\u2019 brushes are also listed.\n\nThat initial list is here - here\n\nIn July, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office added a further $4 billion of EU products that could feature on a final list, which would be subject to tariffs of up to 100%.\n\nThis supplementary list of 89 products features frozen meat, milk, more cheese, olives, fruit, coffee, pork products including sausages, whiskies, fertilizer and copper.\n\nThis additional list is here - here\n\nEU\u2019S $20 BILLION LIST\n\nPlanes, food and handbags also feature on a provisional list of U.S. imports worth $20 billion that the European Union said in April it could hit with tariffs if it wins an award in its WTO case against Boeing subsidies, likely to be next year.\n\nThe EU\u2019s 11-page list also includes a diverse range of produce from dried fruit and nuts to coffee and ketchup, as well as wines and spirits, frozen fish, tobacco, handbags, suitcases, tractors, helicopters and video game consoles.\n\nMore obscure items include bowling alley equipment, casino tables and electric car racing sets.\n\nThe full provisional list is here - here", "description": "The World Trade Organization was set to open the door on Wednesday for the United States to impose hefty tariffs on European goods over subsidies for Airbus .", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
