He names Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa.\n\nHe does not mention that term limits would also purge longtime Democratic senators.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in charge, we can finally deliver: health care, education, clean air and water, and wages you can live on,\u201d Mr. Steyer says in the ad. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. Now, we need action.\u201d\n\nPledging to spend at least $100 million of his hedge fund fortune on the race, Mr. Steyer has blanketed early-voting states with ads that have given his run traction. His spending on a social media campaign has brought in small-dollar donors.\n\nThe effort helped him meet the Democratic National Committee\u2019s polling and donor thresholds to qualify for the party\u2019s presidential primary debate next month in Ohio.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
