The whistleblower\u2019s complaint centered on Trump\u2019s July 25 call pressing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House Intelligence Committee will question Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. The whistleblower reported that Sondland met with Zelensky to give \u201cadvice\u201d about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d Trump\u2019s demands, working behind the scenes to carry out the president\u2019s wishes in a country that\u2019s not a member of the European Union.\n\nIn text messages provided to Congress, Sondland insisted that Trump\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was not a quid pro quo \u2014 as diplomat William B. \u201cBill\u201d Taylor had feared.\n\nDemocrats on Monday subpoenaed Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Office of Management and Budget acting director Russell Vought for documents related to the withholding of U.S. military aid from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding military assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression, as well as any efforts to cover up these matters,\u201d lawmakers said in a letter.\n\nSigning the letter were Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.).\n\nTrump told his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back the military aid for Ukraine shortly before his July call. Trump has repeatedly denied that there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between the military assistance and the request to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAt the White House on Monday, Trump lashed out at Democrats over their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t impeach a president for doing a great job. \u2026 This is a scam,\u201d he said at an event on trade with Japan.\n\nTrump and other administration officials have repeatedly rejected requests for information and testimony in the Democrats\u2019 investigations. The State Department ignored a subpoena for documents last Friday, and an attorney for two Giuliani\u2019s associates who work on the Ukraine matter, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, rebuffed another request on Monday.\n\n\u201c... Overly broad and unduly burdensome,\u201d John D. Dowd, who is representing Parnas and Fruman, wrote to House investigators. \u201cThis, in combination with requiring immediate responses, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the Democratic Committee members\u2019 intent is to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.\u201d\n\nThe highly unusual arrangement for the whistleblower\u2019s testimony underscores the toxicity between Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, which was once considered among the most bipartisan but is now spearheading the divisive impeachment investigation. One individual familiar with the discussions said this is the first time the panel has had to take such extraordinary measures to protect a witness \u2014 including from their own GOP colleagues.\n\nIn a further sign of the breakdown of comity, the committee majority restricted access to the visitor logbook after GOP staffers leaked names of individuals signing in for job interviews when the majority was hiring new staff in early 2019, according to a committee aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe the situation.\n\nOf the whistleblower, Trump has said that he wants to meet his \u201caccuser\u201d and has warned of \u201cBig Consequences.\u201d Trump even alluded to the death penalty for individuals who gave information to the whistleblower, likening them to spies and outraging longtime whistleblower advocates who called his comments chilling.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u2018Whistleblower,\u2019 \u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWas this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d\n\nDemocrats are concerned that without such rare precautions for the whistleblower, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee could learn and then leak the name of the individual, who has agreed to answer questions before the intelligence committees in the House and Senate.\n\n[Live updates: House committees subpoena Pentagon chief and acting director of OMB for documents]\n\nAndrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer representing the whistleblower, sent a letter to acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire expressing fears for his client\u2019s safety. Bakaj also noted that \u201ccertain individuals\u201d have issued a $50,000 \u201cbounty\u201d for \u201cany information\u201d relating to his client\u2019s identity.\n\nHouse Democratic chairmen, meanwhile, immediately cried foul and accused Trump of \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d \u2014 even as some of Trump\u2019s staunchest Capitol Hill allies also began pushing for the disclosure of the whistleblower\u2019s identity. On Sunday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said that if the House impeaches Trump, \u201cI will make sure\u201d the whistleblower faces public questioning.\n\n\u201cIf the whistleblower\u2019s allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it\u2019s imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public, under oath, and cross-examined,\u201d Graham said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nIn the House, Democrats overseeing the logistics of the testimony for the House impeachment inquiry are leaning toward a staff-only session that would prevent lawmakers from attending and asking questions, according to officials familiar with the conversations. Aides have even considered having the whistleblower testify from a separate location via a video hookup in which the camera would obscure the whistleblower\u2019s image and alter his voice, possibly with modification technology.\n\n[Mounting evidence buttresses claims in whistleblower complaint]\n\nTwo other possibilities include having the whistleblower sit behind a screen or partition, or conducting audio-only testimony.\n\n\u201cSchiff does not want to burn his identity,\u201d a senior congressional official said.\n\nDetails for the whistleblower\u2019s testimony are still being worked out, the officials cautioned. Little can be finalized until security clearances for the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers are resolved so they can begin more substantive discussions about logistics, they said.\n\nMark Zaid, one of three lawyers for the whistleblower, said that as of Monday, two have their clearances; the third needs only to sign the paperwork.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a logistics issue,\u201d Zaid said. \u201cIt will happen over the next couple of days.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s legal team is also in discussions with the Senate Intelligence Committee about testifying, according to one individual familiar with the talks. The Senate panel, headed by Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), is known for a more bipartisan approach; its staffers are not considering the extraordinary measures being discussed by the House.\n\nThe House and Senate committees are expected to meet separately with the whistleblower \u2014 both likely away from the Capitol.\n\nThe off-campus meetings probably will be in a secure room provided by the executive branch, according to officials. The meetings could take place \u201cwithin the next couple of weeks,\u201d but no date has been set, one official said.\n\nShould the whistleblower testify from another location, the House panel could ask Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson to confirm the identity of the whistleblower. Atkinson, who adjudicated the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in August, determined that the whistleblower\u2019s allegations were credible and constituted an \u201curgent\u201d concern to national security.\n\n[Trump lashes out again at whistleblower, questions whether Schiff should be arrested for \u2018treason\u2019]\n\nCongressional aides have been discussing the possibility of a transcript from the testimony, but whether the whistleblower\u2019s legal team agrees to that depends on whether the individual\u2019s identity can be protected. The lawyers would not want information shared that could identify the whistleblower.\n\nThe legal team has been hired by a second witness, one who had firsthand knowledge of the events in the complaint. So far, there has been no discussion with Capitol Hill about that person speaking with Congress. That would require permission from the director of national intelligence, but that\u2019s \u201cpro forma\u201d at this point, an official said.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "House Democrats are considering obscuring the individual\u2019s appearance and altering the voice, according to officials.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter", "Greg Miller", "National Security", "Intelligence", "Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eIAjBaLDQWbs7NSdk21yN1VFTbA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LTRWWIHJG4I6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
