Mr. Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill have shown they are most comfortable criticizing the president on matters of international affairs, and have previously joined Democrats to denounce his administration\u2019s unflagging support of Saudi Arabia after the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist. And they declared their disapproval earlier this year of attempts to withdraw American forces from Syria in a bipartisan effort led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s decision last week to essentially clear the way for a Turkish military operation against America\u2019s Kurdish allies in northern Syria has provoked the strongest response yet from Republicans, including many of the president\u2019s most reliable allies.\n\nMr. McConnell opened his weekly news conference on Wednesday by expressing his \u201cgratitude to the Kurds,\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that we are where we are.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Trump said Wednesday that Turkey\u2019s invasion into Syria has \u201cnothing to do with us\u201d and that the Kurds \u201care no angels,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called it \u201can astonishing statement which I completely and totally reject.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, wrote on Twitter that it is \u201cImpossible to understand why @realDonaldTrump is leaving America\u2019s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.\u201d\n\nHawkish lawmakers like Ms. Cheney and Mr. Graham, as well as Democratic leaders in the House, are preparing additional legislative action to punish the Turks\u2019 incursion. Mr. Graham introduced a sanctions package with Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, last week, that would impose harsher sanctions on Turkey than the White House has levied, including the prohibition of American military assistance and the freezing of the American assets of Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish leaders.", "description": "Republicans and Democrats delivered a rebuke to the president over his decision to pull back American troops inside Syria, an order many viewed as acquiescing to Turkey\u2019s incursion against a United States ally.", "authors": ["Catie Edmondson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/us/politics/16dc-syria-vid/16dc-syria-vid-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
