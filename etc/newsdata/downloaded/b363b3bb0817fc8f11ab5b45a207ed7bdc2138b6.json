I really think he could fight until he was 75 if he wanted to, and I\u2019m serious.\n\n\u201cHe lives really clean. His 37 is not the average 37.\u201d\n\nGolovkin, who brings a record of 39-1-1 with 35 knockouts to the bout at Madison Square Garden, says he has been re-energized by the tutelage of Banks as he seeks to regain a belt he first won in 2015.\n\nGolovkin defended the title with wins against Dominic Wade, Kell Brook and Daniel Jacobs and with a draw against Mexico\u2019s Canelo Alvarez.\n\nGolovkin was stripped of the IBF title last year when he failed to make a mandatory defense against Ukraine\u2019s Derevyanchenko, opting instead for a rematch with Alvarez \u2014 who handed Golovkin the first defeat of his career.\n\nDerevyanchenko says he believes he can upset Golovkin to seize the belt and perhaps dim the prospects for a third Golovkin-Alvarez bout in 2020.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care that I\u2019m underdog,\u201d said Derevyanchenko, who owns a record of 13-1 with 10 knockouts. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in the ring, it\u2019s just me and GGG.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. No matter if it\u2019s an underdog or no. It\u2019s just between these guys.\u201d\n\nBut the shadow of Alvarez has loomed large over the bout, even as the Mexican star prepares to make a two-division jump in weight to take on Russia\u2019s World Boxing Organization light heavyweight champion Sergey Kovalev on November 2 in Las Vegas.\n\nGolovkin, who contends that Alvarez \u201cran away\u201d from a rematch, was clearly wearied by repeated questions about Alvarez in the build up to Saturday\u2019s bout.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of different things to talk about, we have a lot of interesting subjects, topics,\u201d he said, chiding reporters for constantly bringing up Alvarez.\n\n\u201cYou asking about Canelo says something about you as journalists. Explore better options. Ask more interesting questions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s your problem, not mine.\u201d", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 Gennady Golovkin takes on Sergiy Derevyanchenko for the vacant International Boxing Federation middleweight title on Saturday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/c05395_gennady-golovkin-kazakhstan-on-way-victory-canadian-steve-rolls-madison-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
