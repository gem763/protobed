But that\u2019s what I did Monday morning. Perhaps we ruined your commute. For that, I am truly sorry. But it was for a higher cause, part of the #ShutdownDC initiative to combat climate change.\n\nI\u2019ll just be blunt: Global warming has radicalized me. It\u2019s radicalizing young people all around us, too. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has millions of climate devotees worldwide under the age of 25. And now, I submit, it\u2019s your turn to become radical, whoever you are, wherever you live. That\u2019s because the climate threat is now truly radical, and time is almost up.\n\nI joined 40 other people on Monday morning. Retired teachers, a Unitarian minister, environmental activists, a waitress. We sat down and blocked all eight lanes of Independence Avenue where it crosses 12th Street, south of the Mall. For three hours, we sat there, surrounded by D.C. police officers who ultimately did not arrest us. Across the city, at 21 additional intersections, more than 1,000 people did the same with a total of 32 peaceful arrests. Many downtown institutions, including the World Bank, told their employees to stay home Monday. Workers who did commute by car were almost certainly affected in ways big or small.\n\nWriter Bill McKibben reminds us that we have pushed our planet far outside its comfort zone. Fossil-fuel combustion, now amplified by pro-coal zealots in the Trump administration, is melting the poles, swelling our oceans, drying out our rainforests and scorching our farmland. We\u2019re seeing historic rainfalls and more 90-degree days than ever.\n\nTo have any chance of blunting these extreme-weather trends, concerned citizens everywhere must push themselves outside of their own personal comfort zones. We have to challenge ourselves to engage in bolder and bolder political action. Watch Thunberg for five minutes, and you see she\u2019s pushed herself completely beyond what is normal and comfortable in her life. She traveled for two weeks to get to the United States on a small sailboat with primitive accommodations, avoiding carbon emissions. She has spent three additional weeks here addressing Congress and the United Nations in her almost painfully shy but profoundly inspiring way.\n\nHer message is simple: Our planet is on fire, and the politicians worldwide \u2014 of all parties \u2014 have not done enough to put it out. These leaders will remain timid until more people, young and old, take direct action, one that leaves no mistake that we are alarmed. We. Are. Alarmed!\n\nThrough creative civil disobedience, we have to create a social crisis that focuses leaders\u2019 attention on the climate crisis. We have to go on strike. We have to leave our classrooms and job sites. We have to march and speak out. We have to shut down streets.\n\nAnd we have to do it now. The world\u2019s top scientists say we have to cut global carbon emissions in half by 2030. That will happen only if we make our elected officials enact radical clean-energy laws that defy the money and political power of ExxonMobil and Peabody Energy. Can\u2019t be done? New York just vowed to get to 70 percent clean electricity by 2030.\n\nI will peacefully shut down more streets. And you should, too. Or do whatever your version of \u201cmuch more\u201d is. Call your elected officials \u2014 a lot. Donate more money to clean-energy candidates. Whatever constitutes more \u2014 do it.\n\nAnd for our leaders, the message is the same. I saw it on a placard at Monday\u2019s protest, held up by a college freshman: \u201cMake policy like your children will live here.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nKate Cohen: Most of us are hypocrites on climate change.
