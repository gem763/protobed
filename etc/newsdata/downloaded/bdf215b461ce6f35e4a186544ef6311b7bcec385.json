If they are being respectful, they aren't causing any harm. (Photo: Elva Etienne, Getty Images)\n\nLast Halloween, one Virginia city went viral for banning anyone 13 years and older from trick-or-treating.\n\nNo, it wasn't a story on The Onion. It was real.\n\nThe city of Chesapeake drew national scrutiny \u2013 and social media uproar \u2013 for its decades-old ordinance that could fine or jail teens caught in costume with a sack full of candy.\n\nIt got so much attention, in fact, the city quickly conducted a review of the ordinance and made changes, the city\u2019s director of public communications Health Covey told USA TODAY.\n\nThe ordinance now enacts a maximum trick-or-treating age of 14 years old and does not allow for possible jail time.\n\nTeens in the city could still face a Class 4 misdemeanor and a fine under the law. But Covey assures the public that police have never actually fined or jailed a teen for trick-or-treating and the law is in place only to prevent issues like teens stealing and smashing pumpkins.\n\n\"The ordinance was, and is, intended to provide police with the authority to take action to keep order and protect public safety,\" Covey said, noting that the law was originally made in 1970 in response to \"incidents of mischief\" on Halloween night.\n\n\"Chesapeake Police officers do not spend Halloween night checking the ages of those out enjoying trick-or-treating in a safe manner,\" Covey added.\n\nGood.\n\nFamilies should have the freedom to decide when the fun-loving era of trick-or-treating is over, not city laws.\n\nThe city of Chesapeake, Virginia has clarified that they won't bother trick-or-treating teens as long as they aren't causing issues.

When asked, \u201cHow old is too old to trick-or-treat?\u201d 73 percent of people said between 12 and 17. But those five years between early and late teens mark a huge difference in adolescent development.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? How else can we crush teen spirit? Footloose-style bans on dancing? 14-year-olds filing tax returns?\n\nTeens trick-or-treating, provided they\u2019re respectful to the people around them, are not doing any harm\u2014and it seems the city of Chesapeake agrees.\n\nAnd we all know what teens could be doing instead: Going to parties with alcohol or illicit drugs. Heck, an already moody teenager sitting sadly at home feeling like they missed out is a bummer enough reason to let them get dressed up and get some candy.\n\n'Let the teens be'\n\nBut the biggest reason teens should be allowed to trick or treat in peace?\n\nTeens don\u2019t need to grow up any faster than they already are.\n\nJudging by the social media during last year's controversy, many people agree.\n\n\"I would rather have teens trick or treat then cause trouble,\" one commented on a news story about the city's ban, adding that sometimes older kids are out helping a younger sibling.\n\nAnother chimed in vowing to personally greet anyone who shows up to her with candy because she would rather see them at her house then committing crimes.\n\n\"We must remember that sometimes teens may not get to be kids when they are kids because of different situations,\" she said.\n\nFinally, a man shared that his wife is 36 years old and has Asperger's and \"a very childlike nature about her.\" She likes to dress up to hand out candy but she also likes to go around to close friends and neighbors to Trick or Treat. Let the teens be.\"\n\nA good reminder that we don't always know everyone's story, so we should always be kind.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/16/halloween-2019-trick-treat-bans-age-limits-absurd/3942119002/", "description": "A Virginia city went viral last Halloween for banning teens from trick-or-treating.
