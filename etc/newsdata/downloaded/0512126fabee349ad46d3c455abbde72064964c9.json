If you look at the possibilities, we have to go and win our next three games to finish third in the group \u2013 that\u2019s still in front of us.\n\n\u201cIf we win those three games we\u2019ll get the positivity back around the place that we\u2019re all striving to get.\n\n\u201cAnd if we do that we\u2019re going into the play-off games in March, hopefully with two matches to secure qualification for Euro 2020.\n\n\u201cSo everything is still in front of us, no matter how bad it\u2019s been or how disappointed we are \u2013 we still have everything to play for.\u201d\n\nFULL TIME | Russia 4 - 0 Scotland\n\n\n\nIt is all over in Moscow.
