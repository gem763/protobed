(Library of Congress)\n\nIt poured rain at the Georgia racetrack that Wednesday and Thursday, and the wind blew water into the covered grandstand where the merchandise was gathered for auction.\n\nMany of the offerings were \u201cprime,\u201d the catalogue said. \u201cLondon\u2019s Kit\u201d was for sale, and \u201cSmith\u2019s Bill,\u201d and \u201cHector\u2019s Bess.\u201d Some were lame or unsound and might not fetch much. But the wealthy Philadelphia owner had squandered huge amounts of his money and needed cash.\n\nSo on March 2 and 3, 1859, Pierce Mease Butler, whose grandfather had signed the U.S. Constitution, sold off 429 human beings he \u201cowned\u201d in what historians say was the largest recorded auction of enslaved people in U.S. history. The incident became known as \u201cthe weeping time\u201d or \u201cthe weeping days.\u201d\n\nNow, two prominent scholars, the award-winning Harvard historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the best-selling Washington author James Swanson, have embarked on a new study of the notorious event and an effort to find possible descendants of those sold.\n\n\u201cThe auction \u2026 was horrible,\u201d Gates, host of the popular PBS show \u201cFinding Your Roots,\u201d said in a recent interview at the National Book Festival in Washington. \u201cThey did filthy things to people. Women, stripped them, poked them. Horrible.\u201d\n\nFamilies were broken up. Stricken loved ones were separated. And, often, those who had been sold were shipped to plantations far away from where they had been born.\n\n['My mother was sold from me': After slavery, the desperate search for loved ones in 'last seen ads']\n\nWhen it was over, buyers and auctioneers celebrated with champagne. The sale had netted over $300,000 \u2014 roughly $9 million today, according to Internet inflation calculators.\n\nSwanson, a collector and author of top-selling books on the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, said the project \u201cis about not just the past. It\u2019s about the present day, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nHistorians Henry Louis Gates Jr., left, and James Swanson, shown here at the National Book Festival in August, are working on a book about \"the weeping time.\" (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cSlavery and race are not at the periphery of American experience,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThey\u2019re at the very core of what America is.\u201d\n\n[As plantations talk more honestly about slavery, some visitors are pushing back]\n\nHe said their researchers have already found some descendants and are seeking others. \u201cSome of them won\u2019t know that they\u2019re part of this story,\u201d he said. He said people who think they may be descendants can email TheWeepingDays@gmail.com.\n\nThe auction \u201cmarks the beginning of the end\u201d of slavery, said Gates, author of this year\u2019s \u201cStony the Road: Reconstruction, White Supremacy, and the Rise of Jim Crow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe [Civil War] breaks out in April of \u201961,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a huge transitional time \u2026 You see the collapse of this wealthy plantation family \u2026 And the humiliation of having to sell these slaves. Unfortunately for them, it\u2019s a year and a half\u201d before the war that would end American slavery.\n\nThe 1859 sale was the climax of the 150-year American tradition of buying and selling people at auction.\n\nThis one was chronicled by an intrepid New York newspaper reporter who attended at great risk, pretending to be a buyer.\n\nButler, then about 49, was a fabulously rich Philadelphian who had only limited interaction with his family plantations near Darien, Ga., on the state\u2019s coast.\n\n\n\nPierce Mease Butler sold 429 enslaved men, women and children at auction in 1859 to pay his debts.

He had lost enormous sums of money in the financial crash of 1857-1858. And he had reputations for dueling, gambling and infidelity, according to historian Malcolm Bell Jr.'s 1987 book about the Butlers.\n\nButler had wooed and married the superstar Shakespearean actress Fanny Kemble in 1834. But their marriage foundered, in part, over her hostility toward slavery and his dependence on it.\n\n\n\nFrances Anne \"Fanny\" Kemble, the ex-wife of Pierce Mease Butler, became an abolitionist. (Courtesy of Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library/University of Georgia)\n\nAfter they parted, she published in 1863 a graphic anti-slavery memoir based on a visit to her husband\u2019s plantations.\n\n\u201cMy heart is full almost to bursting as I walk among these most poor creatures,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTheir nakedness clothes me, and their heavy toil maintains me in luxurious idleness.\u201d\n\nThe auction was held at Savannah\u2019s Ten Broeck racetrack, named for Richard Ten Broeck, the wealthy owner, breeder and rider of thoroughbred racehorses.\n\nThe reporter was Mortimer Thomson, a popular newspaper satirist and later war correspondent who worked for the anti-slavery New York Tribune under the pen name \u201cDoesticks.\u201d\n\nHe had traveled to Savannah, mingled with the buyers, and even placed a low bid here and there to maintain his cover and avoid the \u201ctouching welcome\u201d he would have received as a Yankee journalist. (A Savannah newspaper later called him a spy.)\n\nHis account in the Tribune six days later was a national sensation.\n\nThose up for auction were the field hands, carpenters, wheelwrights, plowmen, rice and cotton pickers, cooks, women, children, infants, lame, blind, aged, unsound, parents, lovers, and siblings.\n\nFive were named Sukey \u2014 one a 50-year-old cotton hand, another an 8-year-old.\n\nThere were three named Pompey. One was an 11-year-old boy. Another was a rice hand with a lame foot.\n\nThere were five Brams. One, age 47, was described in the auction catalogue as a prime cotton driver of high character. Another Bram was 17. Another 9, another 7.\n\nAccording to an original auction catalogue, most of which survives in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, four or five had what might be called last names. The rest, like most of the enslaved, did not.\n\n\n\nAuction catalogue for the sale of enslaved people sold on March 2 and 3 in 1859 to settle the debts of Pierce Mease Butler. (Historical Society of Pennsylvania)\n\nCarrying bundles, tin dishes and drinking gourds, they had been transported during the prior week about 60 miles from the family\u2019s plantations to the racetrack outside Savannah. There, for purposes of inspection, they were placed in sheds used for the horses and carriages of gentlemen race-goers, Thomson reported.\n\nMany of the enslaved had lived their entire lives on the remote Butler land. \u201cHow many aching hearts have been divorced by this summary proceeding no man can ever know,\u201d Thomson wrote.\n\n\u201cOn the faces of all was an expression of heavy grief,\u201d he recorded. \u201cSome sat brooding moodily over their sorrows, their chins resting on their hands, their eyes staring vacantly \u2026 their bodies rocking to and fro with a restless motion that was never stilled.\u201d\n\nDuring the inspections, \u201cthe Negroes were examined with as little consideration as if they had been brutes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe buyers pulling their mouths open to see their teeth, pinching their limbs to find how muscular they were.\u201d\n\nThe auction had been heavily advertised, and the Savannah hotels were jammed with buyers and speculators. The event was handled by the local slave broker Joseph Bryan. One-third of the sale price was required upon purchase, the remainder to be paid in two equal annual installments that included interest.\n\n\n\nThe catalogue of those sold. (Historical Society of Pennsylvania)\n\nAs the auction began, \u201cthe wind howled outside, and through the open side of the building the driving rain came pouring in,\u201d Thomson wrote.\n\nAmong the first to be offered were Elisha, 39, a prime rice planter, his wife, Molly, 35, a rice hand, their son, Israel, 12, and daughter, Sevanda, 3.\n\n['Barbaric': America's cruel history of separating children from their parents]\n\nThomson recounted how Elisha had spotted a \u201cbenevolent-looking\u201d buyer and begged the man to purchase his family. Elisha said that he and his wife were good workers, that his wife was strong and had good teeth. She curtsied for the buyer.\n\nIsrael was \u201cspry,\u201d Elisha said. And Sevanda would make a good hand one day.\n\nThey were a first-rate bargain, Elisha pleaded.\n\nBut the buyer declined and bought someone else, Thomson noted. The family\u2019s fate was not recorded.\n\nAt the conclusion, a crowd gathered around Butler, who had two canvas bags filled with coins.\n\n\u201cTo every negro he had sold \u2026 he gave the munificent stipend of one whole dollar,\u201d Thomson wrote. The coins were fresh from the mint, \u201cto give an additional glitter to his generosity.\u201d\n\n\n\nA sketch depicts an enslaved father being sold away from his family.
