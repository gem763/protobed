Recently, Sir Antony Sher needed a cart to carry the body of his beloved daughter Cordelia. Not Sir Ian McKellen.\n\nA decade ago he was magnificent in Sir Trevor Nunn\u2019s gorgeously extravagant if over-embellished Royal Shakespeare Company production. Now aged 78, he\u2019s an older if no wiser Lear in Jonathan Munby\u2019s clear, thoughtful, terrifically well-paced revival. Hair thinner and greyer, he\u2019s plumper but still every inch the king, and then some.\n\nHis physical strength \u2013 essential in this role \u2013 seems undiminished as he hauls the body of Cordelia on his back. But what makes this production special is the intimate scale of the space, which allows McKellen\u2019s Lear to be more conversational, nuanced, profoundly felt and utterly compelling.\n\nIt\u2019s often said that by the time you are old enough to play Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear, you\u2019re past it. Not Sir Ian McKellen (above, left)\n\nMoreover, with his clothes on \u2013 much was made of him dropping his trousers in Nunn\u2019s storm scene \u2013 he movingly portrays the metaphorical stripping down of a man who had believed he was superhuman and now, oh so agonisingly, discovers his mortality and realises he is just a \u2018poor bare forked animal\u2019. In a very moving moment he puts his own coat around the shoulders of the trembling, naked wretch, Edgar.\n\nThe court is deftly conjured by a circular red carpet, on to which Lear marches in military dress, his medals flashing. His invitation to his daughters to bid for their portion of his kingdom when he announces his retirement is staged like a vulgar after-dinner game, with each on display behind a microphone as he chops up a map of Britain with scissors. One can see why his daughters are less than thrilled to host his household of hooray-Henry knights and squires, all singing drinking songs and leaving dirty footprints everywhere.\n\nKirsty Bushell\u2019s Regan (above with Danny Webb) gets stuck on one note, though her whoop of sexual ecstasy at the brutal blinding of Gloucester suggests that she finds violence a turn-on\n\nWhile the jauntiness of Phil Daniels\u2019s banjo-playing Fool with Eric Morecambe specs stifles some of the pathos of the part, it highlights his bitter irony\n\nFollowing the storm, the circle is a blanched white, the stage bare but for a lone tree, a Beckettian nod to the nihilism that has taken over. Indeed, most of Munby\u2019s ideas make perfect sense, such as the excellent Sin\u00e9ad Cusack playing Lear\u2019s loyal Kent as a countess instead of a count (why not?). And while the jauntiness of Phil Daniels\u2019s banjo-playing Fool with Eric Morecambe specs stifles some of the pathos of the part, it highlights his bitter irony.\n\nKirsty Bushell\u2019s raunchy Regan gets stuck on one note, though her whoop of sexual ecstasy at the brutal blinding of Gloucester (in an abattoir, using a meat hook) horribly suggests that she finds violence a huge turn-on. Tamara Lawrance\u2019s Cordelia struggles to look anything but tough in army camouflage kit. And if there\u2019s no obvious reason why Edmund decides to bump off the Fool, it underlines his casual cruelty.\n\nDervla Kirwan\u2019s sometimes glowing, sometimes glacial, always grand Goneril makes her evil more interesting than her sister Regan\u2019s, and the decency and personal integrity of Dominic Mafham\u2019s Duke of Albany shines with a revelatory light in this dark world.\n\nImpressive.\n\n\n\nJane Eyre\n\nLyttelton, National Theatre, London Until Oct 21, 3hrs\n\nRating:\n\nSally Cookson\u2019s production of Jane Eyre first came to the National Theatre two years ago, and its second run in London proves it is still as inventive as ever \u2013 although it offers a fraction less fizz than the fiery first stint.\n\nThis is largely down to a cast change: Tim Delap doesn\u2019t explode in the role of Rochester quite like his predecessor, and Nadia Clifford is a more pensive, less passionate Jane. The latter isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, though, emphasizing as it does Jane\u2019s cleverness, and her consequent barely suppressed frustration with the repetition of life as a governess.\n\nElsewhere, there\u2019s much still to love. Despite the cast playing many roles, they offer vivid portrayals of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s characters. Hannah Bristow switches seamlessly from a sickly-but-serene Helen Burns to Rochester\u2019s boisterous francophone daughter Adele. Paul Mundell wins the hearts of the audience with his tail-thumping stint as Pilot the dog.\n\nIn the sparse set, simple props make a powerful impact. The candles lighting Thornfield Hall hint both at the flames that will eventually engulf the building, and at the warmth of human connection Jane will discover there with Rochester.\n\nBertha Mason, Rochester's first wife, haunts the stage from the off, echoing the interpretation that reads Bront\u00eb\u2019s madwoman in the attic as Jane\u2019s devilish double. When she sings Noel Coward\u2019s Mad About The Boy (a luscious rendition by Melanie Marshall) it is clear she is referring to Jane\u2019s inner emotional turmoil as much as her own relationship with her husband.\n\nAn innovative and richly musical production that, despite flagging slightly on the energy front, will set your imagination ablaze.\n\nGwendolyn Smith\n\nLabour Of Love\n\nNoel Coward Theatre, London Until Dec 2 2hrs 50mins\n\nRating:\n\nWith James Graham\u2019s super-soaraway hit Ink, about the rise of The Sun, playing to full houses down the street from the theatre where his new play has just opened, this young playwright\u2019s star couldn\u2019t be higher.\n\nBut Labour Of Love, while capturing a world with great success, is not in the same satirical class as the indelible Ink.\n\nSet in the tatty constituency office of Yorkshire-born, Oxford-educated David Lyons (Martin Freeman), Labour MP for a post-industrial Nottinghamshire seat, it charts the slow death of a Labour Party stronghold in the late Eighties, the ascent and fall of Blairism and the love affair between an MP and his prickly agent.\n\nSet in the tatty constituency office of Yorkshire-born, Oxford-educated David Lyons (Martin Freeman), it charts the slow death of a Labour Party stronghold in the late Eighties\n\nThe superb Tamsin Greig snaps and crackles to perfection as Jean \u2013 his idealistic agent \u2013 who knows, as usual, more than he does\n\nIt opens on Election night 2017, with the result of a recount expected at any minute. The superb Tamsin Greig snaps and crackles to perfection as Jean \u2013 his idealistic agent \u2013 who knows, as usual, more than he does. From there the action goes back to 1990, when Lyons won a by-election, and every subsequent change of government is richly illustrated with video footage.\n\nThere are good jokes aplenty: \u2018Do you know why we chose a rose for Labour?\u2019 \u2018Because it looks pretty but it\u2019s full of pricks?\u2019 But too many are, well, laborious, such as the ancient one about Peter Mandelson\u2019s \u2019tache: \u2018What\u2019s he hiding?\u2019 \u2018His top lip?\u2019\n\nGreig\u2019s Jean is the only character with real depth and texture. A lightweight Freeman fails to suggest the gravitas of a man who once held a Cabinet post. Lyons\u2019s posh lawyer wife Elizabeth (Rachael Stirling), wearing jodhpurs and stilettos for a march against job losses, is as crassly implausible as the Chinese businessman interested in building a new factory.\n\nNot at all a labour in vain \u2013 given a trim, it could become a much safer seat in the West End.\n\nDido, Queen Of Carthage\n\nSwan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon Until Oct 28, 2hrs 50mins\n\nRating:\n\nChristopher Marlowe\u2019s first play \u2013 rarely staged \u2013 tells of Aeneas, a refugee from burning Troy. He finds himself washed up on the shores of North Africa, where Dido, Queen of Carthage, falls for him, thanks to Cupid, a cheery little chap with a hypodermic.\n\nAeneas is torn by his destiny in Italy and his lust for Dido. Staged on black sand, this often comic play of gods and mortals is shot through with vistas of Marlowe\u2019s genius. Sandy Grierson\u2019s quivering Scots voice does full justice to Aeneas\u2019s harrowing speech about the Trojan slaughter. Chipo Chung, as Dido, gives a right royal performance as the heartbroken queen who throws herself on a burning pyre.\n\nChipo Chung, as Dido, gives a right royal performance as the heartbroken queen who throws herself on a burning pyre\n\nShakespeare-lovers will marvel at how much of this play he pinched, with its tempests, disguises and love potions. And in Dido you find the sultry prototype for Cleopatra. With haunting music, this Elizabethan rarity is a real revelation.\n\nLess successful from the Royal Shakespeare Company is the last play in its \u2018Rome\u2019 season, Coriolanus (Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until Saturday) \u2605\u2605. Having single-handedly crushed the Volsci, the mighty warrior Coriolanus should be a hero. But his arrogant contempt for the voters gets him banished. So he swaps sides and turns on Rome.\n\nSope Dirisu\u2019s fearsome Coriolanus is dripping in gore. But while he\u2019s terrific to look at, his verse-speaking is drab, a major setback in such a huge part. His scheming rival, Aufidius, is well played by James Corrigan. But the two tribunes \u2013 substantial parts \u2013 have been gender-reassigned as women, wrongly diluting the play\u2019s strident machismo.\n\nThis update has occasional flashes of emotion but does little to cast new light on this timely, austere masterpiece about power and the people.\n\nRobert Gore-Langton\n\nFor Love Or Money\n\nWest Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds On tour until December 2 2hrs\n\nRating:\n\nThis, sadly, is Barrie Rutter\u2019s last touring show for Northern Broadsides, the Halifax-based company he founded 25 years ago. A satire about greed, lust and money, it\u2019s based on a 300-year-old French satire called Turcaret, by Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage. Blake Morrison has devised a ribald script relocated to the Twenties and chock-full of lost Yorkshire-isms (tea is \u2018chatter-watter\u2019).\n\nRutter plays a corrupt provincial bank manager, Algy, who\u2019s courting a broke widow (Sarah-Jane Potts). She is milking him for jewels and cheques.\n\nThere\u2019s a spivvy doctor\u2019s son who\u2019s using her to get at the manager\u2019s money, and a scheming servant who\u2019s \u2018out for himsen\u2019. Algy\u2019s fake-French wife (Sarah Parks, glorious) arrives late in the day to queer the pitch further.\n\nIt\u2019s funny and also rather touching to watch Rutter, surrounded by his company, saying farewell in a really good comic part, delivered with his own brand of ever-audible gusto.\n\nRobert Gore-Langton\n\nnorthern-broadsides.co.uk", "description": "It\u2019s often said that by the time you are old enough to play Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear, you\u2019re past it.
