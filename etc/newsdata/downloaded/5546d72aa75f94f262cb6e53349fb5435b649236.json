This is just what we do. Our teams do this with regularity and professionalism and dedication to children. When we made the phone call saying, \u2018We need your support,\u2019 the caregivers didn\u2019t bat an eye. They\u2019re really the hero of the situation.\u201d\n\nAs of Friday, Hurricane Dorian had weakened but was still dangerous, its winds battering North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. It had slammed the Bahamas with 185 mph winds earlier this week, leaving at least 30 deaths and a massive path of destruction. It then headed toward Florida and Georgia but largely stayed off the coast.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRoberts told PEOPLE that the hospitals from which the babies were moved did not completely evacuate, and teams relied on trucks instead of a helicopter due to the weather concerns. The babies were expected to head back to Savannah on Friday.", "description": "The staff members headed out as forecasters warned that the hurricane was headed for Georgia\u2019s coast, prompting concern about safety.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/transport-team-Childrens-Healthcare-of-Atlanta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
