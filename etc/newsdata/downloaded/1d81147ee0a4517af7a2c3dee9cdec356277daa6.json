At first, college seemed like the last thing Orry might want to consider. But Crystal showed Orry the website for Catawba Valley Community College in nearby Hickory, and he saw that the school offered an associate\u2019s degree in welding. He had done a little welding in high school and liked it, and that made the notion of college a lot easier to imagine. \u201cIt dawned on me that by firing me, they had given me an opportunity,\u201d Orry told me, talking about his former employer. \u201cI could go to college to better myself, and I could find a different job, something that was away from all this.\u201d\n\nWhen I met Orry on that November night in Taylorsville, he was just a couple of months into his first semester at CVCC. To his surprise, he had come to see college as his route to a better life, not just for himself but for his young family. \u201cI want my kids to have stuff I didn\u2019t have growing up,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to have to wonder where their next meal is coming from. I want them to have the chances I never had.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nOne of the many odd things about the rhetoric that posits welding as the antithesis of college is that in order to become a welder, you actually have to go to college. You can learn the basics in a high-school shop class, as Orry did, but to do it well, you not only have to master multiple precise manual skills; you also need a pretty deep scientific understanding of the metal you\u2019re working with and the electrical and chemical processes you\u2019re using to manipulate that metal. To earn an associate\u2019s degree, Orry would need to pass 12 separate welding courses, plus basic courses in math and English, as well as more conceptual courses in welding metallurgy.\n\nHis first year at CVCC went well, mostly. It wasn\u2019t completely smooth\u2014he failed his required English course, which was offered only online. But in his welding classes, he earned nothing but A\u2019s and B\u2019s. After that first year ended, he ran into some bureaucratic trouble with his financial aid, he told me, and he took both the summer and the fall of 2017 off from school. For a while, I wondered whether he might just be finished with college. But then he started up again as a full-time student in January 2018.\n\nWhen I visited him that winter, Orry said he was glad to be back in school, but otherwise, life was not going well. He and Crystal were broke. They had been evicted from their house, and their car was stolen. There was a moment that semester, Orry told me, when he wanted to give up on school, leave his family behind, and start over in a new town. But he kept thinking of his children and the example he was setting for them, and he decided to get back to class, even if he had to take the bus many miles to get there.", "description": "Is a lucrative college-free job too good to be true?", "authors": ["Paul Tough"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/WealthyWelder/facebook.jpg?1568066125", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
