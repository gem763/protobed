This was back in 2015, and Stacey had recently been made redundant from a job as a graphic designer.\n\nFour years later and her firm, named LoveLayla , has grown to the point that it is now a multi-million pound operation, having won a legion of celebrity fans.\n\nYou won\u2019t get very far with greetings cards\n\nStacey says that she initially started the firm as a freelance graphic design business, but turned to cards for special occasions after that disappointing shopping experience.\n\nStarting with just \u00a330 from her kitchen table, she admits: \u201cWe were totally skint\u2026 I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing.\u201d\n\nAnd while family and friends were very supportive, one comment was made that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to get very far with greetings cards\u201d.\n\nKeeping up with orders\n\nThankfully for Stacey and her family, that didn\u2019t turn out to be the most accurate of predictions, with interest in the firm\u2019s range of cheeky cards quickly taking off.\n\nStacey admits that the big challenge initially was getting the orders out as professionally as possible, often with little sleep.\n\n\u201cIt was about keeping on top of the business and not letting it run away.\u201d\n\nA big factor in those early sleepless nights was the fact that Stacey and husband Jay also had one-year-old Layla to worry about, their daughter and inspiration for the business\u2019s name.\n\nStacey suggests that these long nights were actually something of a blessing in disguise, allowing her to come up with card ideas from a parenting angle.\n\nShe adds: \u201cLots of card ideas come from the frustrating and tiring times,\u201d particularly when it comes to creative use of swear words.\n\nA network of support\n\nLoveLayla was clearly built on a team effort, with Stacey\u2019s parents looking after Layla a few times a week before she started school so that Stacey could devote her time to the burgeoning business.\n\nHer friend Vikki also helped with childcare and now works in the business.\n\n\u201cIn the early days, my family and friends all helped us to pack the cards and stick stamps and address labels.\n\n\"In the evenings, food parcels were brought for us when we were dead on our feet and my husband and business partner Jay used to stay up every night to manage all the paperwork and orders while I fed Layla.\u201d\n\nWinning celebrity fans\n\nStacey quickly turned her attentions to social media as a way to expand the business\u2019s reach, which she says has proved \u201ceffective\u201d, particularly as it has also led to LoveLayla winning over a horde of well-known fans.\n\nThese include the likes of Dragon\u2019s Den\u2019s Theo Paphitis, Katie Price, and a host of reality show regulars like Georgia Toffolo, Vicky Pattison and Abbie Holborn.\n\nStacey says: \u201cCelebrity fans have helped gain exposure but also grow trust behind our brand - if a celeb backs us, then we must be good!\u201d\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nGiven the business started with such small sums, Stacey is understandably delighted at having built a successful venture which has now expanded into similarly non-PC gifts like stationery, calendars and wrapping paper.\n\n\u201cWe have never had any investment or had to remortgage the house. Our growth is financed by reinvesting back into the business.\u201d\n\nThat latest reinvestment is in the form of a new digital printing machinery in its West Yorkshire factory, which will enable the firm to launch next-day delivery of its personalised cards and gifts.\n\nLoveLayla has also set up an established franchise in Australia, with other markets around the world being considered.\n\nUnsurprisingly the card business is a seasonal beast, so Stacey is optimistic that its best-ever Christmas period lies ahead, with a new range of 178 original festive cards available.\n\nShe explains: \"Customer loyalty is essential to us, and we see lots of repeat business from customers who like our product range, so it's key to keep innovating and give them fresh, new ranges to look at.\"\n\nAnd she encourages other would-be entrepreneurs to take the leap and follow their business dreams.\n\n\u201cGo with your gut and trust your instincts. Just give it a whirl - we launched cards because we had \u00a330 in the bank and we needed to pay our next month\u2019s bills, four years later we have a thriving business.\u201d", "description": "Stacey Dennis was down to \u00a330 in the bank having been made redundant, but that didn't stop her starting her greetings card business LoveLayla - named after hey young daughter", "authors": ["John Fitzsimons"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20378134.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_StaceyDennis.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
