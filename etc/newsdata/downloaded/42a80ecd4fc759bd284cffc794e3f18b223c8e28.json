Prior to this career change, I had been investing in CEFs for several years but not full time, more long-term investing than trading. I had not figured out the whole strategy when I started and it evolved as I learned. I continue to learn. This is just a summary, not a \"how to.\"\n\nGoals\n\nMy goal is high absolute risk adjusted returns. Maybe 10% annually, on average. I try to minimize taxes but not at the expense of returns. Aside from taxes, I don't care how my returns are broken down into income and capital gains. My investing returns must cover all of my personal expenses but my portfolio turnover is high enough that sales proceeds easily cover those expenses so I am indifferent towards dividends and yield.\n\nI don't care about the volatility of individual investments, only the volatility of my portfolio as a whole. The reason I care about volatility is because I view volatility as opportunity cost. When markets swoon, if one's portfolio swoons as much as the market, much of the opportunity to take advantage is lost. That's why I pay so much attention to risk adjusted returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, etc.\n\n\n\nAsset Allocation\n\nDiversification is the bread and butter of increasing risk adjusted returns.\n\nI invest more in fixed income funds than stock funds. I think a small allocation to stocks is a good diversifier for fixed income.\n\nAfter accounting for leverage, both CEF leverage and any personal margin debt, my asset allocation might be about 30-50% stocks and 60%-100% fixed income. I sometimes sell ETFs short or purchase put options to adjust my asset allocation. When you see those in my portfolio, they're hedges; I'm not using them to bet against the market.\n\nMy asset allocation is tactical and contrarian. I watch VIX throughout the day. When VIX goes up I decrease allocation to CEFs and when VIX goes down I increase allocation to CEFs. It's contrarian because I do the opposite of what most CEF investors do; I trade before changes in implied volatility are incorporated in CEF prices rather than after.\n\nI don't use any technical indicators, just a chart of VIX, 2 days with 1-minute bars, updated in real-time.\n\nIf VIX is trending up strongly, decreasing allocation to CEFs might mean selling. If it's a weak signal, I might just cancel all my buy orders. Vice-versa when VIX is trending down. Most days, I have 10-30 orders open at a time. I will open and cancel orders amd adjust the limit prices throughout the day as market conditions change.\n\nDiscount Mean Reversion Strategy\n\nMost of my investments follow this strategy. I buy CEFs when they have a discount z-score below -2. My only goal is to sell them when they have a z-score of +1 or more. I don't care about value, fundamentals or dividends unless I think they will impact the z-score. I do this systematically and that is where most of the portfolio turnover comes from. I use 1-month z-scores most of the time but increase the lookback period to 3-months or sometimes even 6-months when markets swoon.\n\nThere are some CEFs I either don't invest in or limit exposure to with this strategy, including funds that are likely to announce rights offerings, single sector stock funds (like MLP funds), funds with governance issues, funds that have recently cut distribution, etc.\n\nEvent-driven Strategy\n\nThis mostly involves anticipating news that is not yet incorporated in market prices. Primarily I'm looking for hints about future market moving events like changes in distribution or investment policy, activist investors, large institutional trades, corporate actions, etc. I try to position my portfolio to take advantage of these events.\n\nThroughout the day, as they are published, I skim or read every press release and SEC filing relating to CEFs. One doesn't have to anticipate news; sometimes one just needs to be able to react to announcements before they are priced in. The CEF market is slow to react to news and this is still something that humans can do. Experience is key; one must be able to make a gut call about how news will impact prices within a few minutes of the news going public.\n\nOption Strategy\n\nThis strategy complements asset allocation. The options concerned are always SPY put options. The total notional value of SPY put options will be less than my total allocation to large cap stocks and stock funds, i.e. they're a hedge rather than a bet against the stock market.\n\nI don't buy CEF put options because generally none are listed, though there are exceptions like DSL, which has options, or used to.\n\nThis is sort of a value investing strategy with put options. When VIX is below 12, I start to buy SPY put options, increasing allocation again at VIX 11.5, 11, and maximum allocation at 10.5. I start to sell those put options when VIX increases above 20 to 25. This is a frustrating strategy because one bleeds money rolling put options waiting for market volatility. It's also pretty scary when one sells because one is likely selling one's hedge during a market swoon.\n\n\n\nTax Strategy\n\nIn order to reduce tax expenses, I try to realize a good portion of gains as long-term gains rather than short-term gains. As a general rule, all of my investments are available for sale if the price is right. I have an exception for investments that have risen to 5% or more above cost basis. I don't sell tax lots with 5% or higher gains until they are at least 12 months from purchase. There are exceptions. For example, in some cases a corporate action might force a sale or I might anticipate news where the tax expenses of selling short-term outway the anticipated investment losses from holding.\n\nOther Strategies\n\nThis isn't a complete list but I'll stop here because I think I've covered everything that might be of interest to this audience.\n\n@SteddyEddy, 2018 portfolio return was 2%.", "description": "The purpose of this post is to answer two questions on the September Holdings thread.
