Gavin Newsom on Friday made his state the first to require public universities to offer abortion medication at campus health centers, beginning in 2023.\n\nNewsom contrasted the progressive goals of his new law with restrictions recently enacted in other states.\n\n\u201cAs other states and the federal government go backward, restricting reproductive freedom, in California we are moving forward, expanding access and reaffirming a woman\u2019s right [to] choose,\u201d Newsom said, according to The Sacramento Bee. \u201cWe\u2019re removing barriers to reproductive health \u2013 increasing access on college campuses and using technology to modernize how patients interact with providers.\u201d\n\nA number of states -- including Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Mississippi and Georgia -- have in recent months enacted such abortion restrictions as banning the procedure after six weeks, when a heartbeat has been detected. A number of the restrictions have been challenged in court.\n\nNewsom\u2019s predecessor, fellow Democrat Jerry Brown, vetoed similar legislation last year, arguing such a requirement wasn\u2019t necessary since abortion services were readily available off-campus.\n\nTERMINALLY ILL GROOM'S BUCKET LIST WEDDING TURNS OUT 'ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE'\n\nDemocratic State Sen. Connie Leyva first crafted the legislation three years ago.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled that Governor Newsom rejected the misguided paths that other states have taken in limiting access to abortion care,\u201d Leyva said in a statement. \u201cAbortion is a protected right, and it is important that everyone \u2014 including college students \u2014 have access to that right if they so choose.\u201d\n\nThe law will rely on private donations, not state dollars, to pay for the services. The state hopes to raise more than $10 million.\n\nAPPEALS COURT BLOCKS OHIO BAN ON DOWN SYNDROME ABORTIONS\n\nAbortion medication is available to women who are less than 10 weeks' pregnant and requires taking two pills. The first pill blocks the hormone progesterone. The second, taken days later at home, causes an effect similar to a miscarriage.\n\nAll 34 of California\u2019s public colleges would be required to provide the services.\n\nReligious and conservative groups objected to the legislation. \u201cWe oppose any effort to make it easier to abort a baby before he or she is born,\u201d Rudra Reddy, external vice president for the Berkeley College Republicans, told The Sacramento Bee. \u201cNewsom is opposed to the moratorium on the death penalty in California but he\u2019s perfectly fine executing unborn children.\u201d\n\n\"Governor Newsom\u2019s reckless support for a new abortion pill distribution scheme on California college and university campuses will put students\u2019 lives at risk and put schools at risk of lawsuits as conscience rights are violated,\" Students for Life of America president Kristan Hawkins said in a statement. \"The Pro-Life Generation will not sit back and watch their college and university campuses be turned into Planned Parenthood\u2019s new money-making machine.\"\n\nRepublicans voted against the measure in committee hearings. A handful of Assembly Democrats abstained during floor debates.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Department of Finance, under Newsom\u2019s office, also opposed the bill, citing a lack of resources, personnel expertise and private funds to support a program of such \u201csize, scope or content.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "California Gov.
