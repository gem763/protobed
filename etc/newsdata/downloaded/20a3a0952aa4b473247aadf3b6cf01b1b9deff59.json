(The 2017 motion did cause controversy).\n\nAs with anything related to language in Quebec, \"bonjour/hi\" is a thorny issue.\n\nChristine St-Pierre, the Liberal MNA for Acadie and the opposition critic on the French language portfolio, says the greeting is \"always, always, always going to be a sensitive topic in Quebec, because the French language is so fragile.\"\n\n\"We're just two per cent of North America,\" she said.\n\nGeoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network, said he opposes the government's plan to scrap 'bonjour/hi.' (CBC)\n\nIn Montreal, some view the double-edged greeting as emblematic of the city's bilingual identity. But for other Quebecers, the notion of bilingualism can be problematic, and the addition of the English \"hi\" is a warning sign.\n\n\"It starts with that, and eventually you speak only in English,\" Fran\u00e7ois Legault said in reference to \"bonjour/hi\" on CBC's Daybreak in 2017, around a year before he became premier.\n\nGeoffrey Chambers, president of the Quebec Community Groups Network, a non-profit advocacy group for English-speaking Quebecers, said that by taking aim at the bilingual greeting, the government is trying to pick at an old scab.\n\n\"It's not a bad thing. It shouldn't be prohibited. It won't be able to be prohibited. It just seems to me to be looking for a fight where we really don't need one.\"\n\nAwaiting a plan\n\nWhen pressed for specifics about his plans, Jolin-Barrette said repeatedly he was reflecting on the issue and would return with a plan in the coming weeks or months.\n\nSt-Pierre said the Quebec Liberal Party was in favour of policies to protect French in the province.\n\n\"I'm ready to look at whatever the minister puts on the table,\" she said. \"I'm ready to discuss with him, to work in concert with him, to make sure French is well protected in Quebec.\n\n\"But you can also be certain that we support individual freedoms. And this government has a bad habit of suspending individual freedoms. We'll see what the government is going to do.\"\n\nSt-Pierre resisted condemnation of Jolin-Barrette's plans, noting that he had yet to deliver any specific policies or bills.\n\n\"I don't know what he has in mind,\" she said. \"We will see what he wants to do. If he tables a bill, we will look at the bill.\"\n\nLayton Audio owner Sheldon Cohen says his employees usually start by greeting customers in French. (CBC)\n\n'It's a polite greeting'\n\nIn practical terms, each business seems to go their own way when it comes to determining how staff greet customers.\n\nWhen people walk into Layton Audio in downtown Montreal, employees usually start with \"bonjour,\" said owner Sheldon Cohen, who is an anglophone.\n\n\"We see which language they're most comfortable with, whether it's English or French,\" he said. \"It's a habit that we do. We're in Quebec, so we assume French first.\"\n\nHe said he doesn't see why some people blow the issue out of proportion.\n\n\"You shouldn't get offended if someone says 'hello, bonjour' or whatever. There's no offence to it. It's a polite greeting.\"", "description": "A month after taking on\u00a0the French language portfolio, Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette says he hopes to ensure \"bonjour\" is the default greeting in the province's stores and businesses\u00a0\u2014 not \"bonjour/hi.\"", "authors": ["John Macfarlane Is A Journalist At Cbc Montreal.
