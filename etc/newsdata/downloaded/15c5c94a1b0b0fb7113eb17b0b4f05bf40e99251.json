REUTERS/Jessica Lutz/Files\n\nPrices climbed for a fourth day and were also supported by comments from the United Arab Emirates\u2019 energy minister that OPEC and its allies are committed to balancing the crude market.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent was up 61 cents, or 1%, at $62.15 a barrel by 0649 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate was up 65 cents, or 1.2%, at $57.17 a barrel.\n\nSalman, a long-time member of the Saudi delegation to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, was named minister on Sunday, replacing Khalid al-Falih. He is the son of Saudi King Salman. It is the first time the energy portfolio has been handed to a member of the royal family.\n\nHe helped to negotiate the current global agreement on supply cuts between OPEC and non-OPEC countries including Russia, a group known as OPEC+.\n\nA Saudi official said on Sunday there would be no shift in Saudi and OPEC policy.\n\n\u201cThe change at the top doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a shift in policy as much as it\u2019s being viewed as a move to improve relations within OPEC and with non-OPEC producers in the wake of the latest Russian compliance fissures,\u201d said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at Axi Trader.\n\nRussia\u2019s oil output in August exceeded its quota under the OPEC+ agreements.\n\nUAE Energy and Industry Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Sunday that members of OPEC and non-OPEC producers were \u201ccommitted\u201d to achieving oil market balance.\n\nTrade and geopolitical tensions are affecting the market more than demand and supply, Mazrouei said, but he was quick to rule out hasty steps influenced by the trade war between the United States and China.\n\n\u201cThe fear of slower (oil) demand is only going to happen if that tension is escalating and I am personally hopeful that is not the case,\u201d Mazrouei told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nPrices on Monday were also supported by a rise in oil imports in China in August, with shipments to the world\u2019s biggest importer up 3% from July and nearly 10% higher in the first eight months of 2019 from a year earlier.\n\nIn the United States, drilling companies cut the number of operating oil rigs for a third week in a row last week.", "description": "Oil rose on Monday on expectations that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to support output cuts by OPEC and other producers to prop up prices under new Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman.", "authors": ["Aaron Sheldrick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427830345&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF880DR", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
