The Drive reported last week that several videos of Tesla owners using the feature in public parking lots \u2014 you know, the ones that tend to be rife with other cars driving around \u2014 showed near misses or actual collisions.\n\nThe NHTSA told Reuters in a statement that it \u201cis aware of reports related to Tesla\u2019s Summon feature. We are in ongoing contact with the company and we continue to gather information. Safety is NHTSA\u2019s top priority and the agency will not hesitate to act if it finds evidence of a safety-related defect.\u201d The company didn\u2019t respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe NHTSA also directed the American public to report potential issues with the vehicles using its vehicle safety complaint page, according to CNBC.\n\n(Perhaps Tesla should not have described the feature as \u201cperfect\u201d for users to have their car \u201cnavigate a parking lot and come to them or their destination of choice, as long as their car is within their line of sight,\u201d especially if they have an \u201coverflowing shopping cart, are dealing with a fussy child, or simply don\u2019t want to walk to your car through the rain.\u201d)\n\nOther party thinks that I was actually driving because I ran to my car before he got out. Please give me some advise. @LikeTeslaKim @TesLatino @Model3Owners @teslaownersSV @teslamodel3fan pic.twitter.com/ScE12wHqA9 \u2014 David F Guajardo (@DavidFe83802184) September 28, 2019\n\nReuters described some of the incidents:\n\nThe poster, Dallas-based solutions architect Roddie Hasan, commented that his \u201cfirst test of Smart Summon didn\u2019t go so well.\u201d \u201c...A car pulled in from the road and around the corner into the lot, and I expected the Tesla to \u2018see\u2019 it and stop, however I had to take my finger off the (app) button when I saw that my Tesla wasn\u2019t slowing down,\u201d Hasan told Reuters. Another Twitter user, Mark Solomon, also posted a video that showed his car was not able to park itself properly using the feature. \u201cNot sure what the problem was but I think an older map of the parking lot was being used,\u201d he said.\n\nMusk has previously described parking lots as a \u201cremarkably hard problem\u201d to solve, which tracks.\n\nParking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 13, 2019\n\nGiven Smart Summon hasn\u2019t been out that long and Tesla is planning on rolling out more self-driving functions to its cars over time, the relatively low-stakes incidents reported so far are probably a sign of things to come. As CNBC noted, two prior fatal crashes involving Tesla Autopilot features remain under investigation by the NHTSA and U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).", "description": "The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) isn\u2019t so thrilled with Tesla\u2019s rollout of a feature that automatically summons the company\u2019s vehicles in parking lots, telling Reuters they are investigating resulting crashes....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Sam Rutherford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ilt9lht5fvbmfynveukc.jpg"}
