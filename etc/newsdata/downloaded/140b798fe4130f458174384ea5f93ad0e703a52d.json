According to Shaye, that\u2019s not by accident.\n\nIn an interview with Gizmodo for The Grudge, Shaye took some time to chat about the upcoming Penny Dreadful: City of Angels, which shifts the scene from Victorian-era London to Los Angeles in 1938 \u2014 with more of a focus on Mexican-American folklore instead of English literature.\n\nThe series, which also features Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer, dives into everything from suburban sprawl to the rise of radio evangelism. Then, there\u2019s the growing threat of the Third Reich. According to Shaye, there\u2019s a very specific reason these were the stories Logan chose to tell.\n\n\u201cThey wanted him to do a fourth season because it was very successful, people loved the show, and he said he just didn\u2019t have anything further to say about that \u2014 until Donald Trump became president,\u201d Shaye said. \u201cAnd then, he had some things he wanted to express.\u201d\n\nShaye also shared some information about her character, Dottie Minter, an older woman \u2014 or, as she put it, \u201can old-old lady\u201d who is \u201cdressed to the nines\u201d \u2014 who\u2019s teamed up with Detective Lewis Michener (Lane) to help hunt a bunch of Nazis doing espionage work in the City of Angels.\n\nThey\u2019re currently in the middle of filming the first season, with a massive and impressive set that\u2019s recreated Los Angeles in the 1930s. But Shaye has no idea what\u2019s in store. She said it\u2019s been kind of a wild ride, because she has no clue where her character\u2019s story arc is going next. Why\u2019s that? \u201cJohn won\u2019t tell us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just like a pig in doodoo,\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about it.\u201d\n\nPenny Dreadful: City of Angels is currently in production and no release date has been announced.", "description": "There\u2019s nothing cooler than hearing Insidious star Lin Shaye share what she and Nathan Lane are up to in Penny Dreadful: City of Angels: \u201cWe\u2019re Nazi hunters!\u201d Showrunner John Logan\u2019s follow-up to Penny Dreadful feels like it\u2019s less about the monsters in fantasy books and more about the ones in real life....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/g/2016/03/Donald-Trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
