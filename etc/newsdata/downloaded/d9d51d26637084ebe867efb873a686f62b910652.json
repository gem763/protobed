We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong. Many concerned customers in Hong Kong have contacted us about this app and we immediately began investigating it,\u201d a spokesperson told Fox News.\n\nThe spokesperson continued: \u201cThe app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement. This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, an article in the state-owned media China Daily accused the tech giant of \"helping [Hong Kong] rioters engage in more violence\" after it reversed a decision to ban the app and reallow it, following a wave of public criticism.\n\nAPPLE WILL BUILD NEW MAC PROS IN TEXAS AMID TARIFFS\n\n\"As a company with international influence, Apple has always enjoyed a high reputation,\" the article reads. \"A company has its own standards of conduct, but should also have its social responsibilities. If Apple abandons its responsibilities and let violent acts get worse, it puts more users at risk.\"\n\nThe article continues: \"Business is business, and politics is politics. Nobody wants to drag Apple into the lingering unrest in Hong Kong. But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts. Apple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision.\"\n\nChina is an extremely important market for the iPhone maker, as the tech giant looks to offset slowing sales in its home market. In its most recent quarter, Greater China, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounted for $9.15 billion of its $53.8 billion quarterly revenue, or approximately 17 percent of quarterly revenue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Less than 24 hours after Apple received criticism from a state-run media company in China for reinstating the HKMap app in the App Store the tech giant has pulled the app again.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AppleiPhone11Getty2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
