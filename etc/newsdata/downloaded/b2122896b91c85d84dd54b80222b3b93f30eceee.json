Bush, who was the managing partner of the club when the ballpark opened in 1994.\n\nAfter a 6-1 victory over the New York Yankees, a parade long enough to make a ring around the field took home plate across the street to Globe Life Field. The retractable-roof stadium, which officially opens with a March 31 game against the Los Angeles Angels, will have the option of air conditioning once the Texas heat kicks in next spring and summer.\n\n\u201cI do think there is a need for it,\u201d former Texas outfielder Rusty Greer said. \u201cAt some point, if they\u2019re ever going to build a new stadium, then obviously it\u2019s got to be covered with AC. Because if not, then there would be no reason to build one.\u201d\n\nGreer was among 15 former Rangers introduced as part of the all-time Globe Life Park team. Hall of Fame catcher Pudge Rodriquez also made the finale, as did Adrian Beltre, a little more than two years after getting his 3,000th hit in the park he called home for his final eight seasons.\n\nThe former Rangers hopped in pickups for the short ride across the street along with hundreds of fans headed by a police escort and a firetruck.\n\nRichard Greene, who was mayor for the city\u2019s vote to approve the stadium\u2019s funding and during the building and opening of what was then known as The Ballpark in Arlington, was part of the ceremonial transfer of home plate.\n\nThe Rangers called on a little history to close the old place, beginning with the national anthem played by the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra , just as it was 25 years earlier when the pianist Van Cliburn also was part of the rendition.\n\nThe crowd of 44,144 - bringing the park\u2019s final total to 66,744,029 - went wild when strikeout king Nolan Ryan emerged from the dugout to throw out the ceremonial first pitch to Kenny Rogers, who threw Globe Life\u2019s only perfect game in its debut season.\n\nThe fans didn\u2019t seem to care that Ryan, who had the last two of his record seven no-hitters with the Rangers, bounced the pitch. They were just happy to see the tall Texan six years after he resigned as team president - he later became a consultant for rival Houston.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely sad,\u201d said Will Clark, who hit the first regular-season homer by a Ranger at the new park. \u201cWhen you played in the first game, 25 years for the most part is a fairly young ballpark. To see it go, yeah, it\u2019s pretty emotional.\u201d\n\nSame for the fans, including a woman who was among those who stayed in their seats long after the parade had wound out of the stadium. She was seen crying on television, with her husband\u2019s arm draped over her shoulder.\n\nThose emotions weren\u2019t saved for the last day. Shirley Kost, who has been going to games since moving to the Dallas area 40 years ago, said she and her friends were crying the day before they said goodbye to Globe Life - and she said they probably would be again Sunday.\n\nWhat the 80-year-old Kost will miss the most is what so many others say is their favorite thing about the park: the curb appeal. The granite and red brick facade, lined with high-arched openings for a view of the concourse and steel support beams, has always been a favorite.\n\n\u201cI wish we could take it with us,\u201d Kost said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to love the new one, too. It\u2019s just going to take a little time.\u201d\n\nBush sat a few rows above the Texas on-deck circle next to former first lady Laura Bush and Deedie Rose, the widow of Bush\u2019s co-owner, Rusty Rose. Tom Schieffer, who was the club president and threw out the ceremonial first pitch 25 years ago, also was in the group.\n\n\u201cIt really is a reminder of this wonderful partnership we had,\u201d said Bush, who had to give up ownership of the Rangers after he was elected Texas governor in 1994. \u201cAnd sitting in this cathedral we built, it means a lot.\u201d\n\nYankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton made the last out, on a check-swing strikeout against Jos\u00e9 Leclerc.\n\nAfter all the former Rangers were introduced, club hits leader Michael Young tossed a ceremonial final pitch to Rodriguez. The catcher known for his defensive skills threw to Andrus at second base, and raised his arms with a big smile when the throw made it without a bounce.\n\nThe only downer for the former players was the sense that perhaps their old home was closing too soon.\n\n\u201cI drove up today and I was walking out, told my wife, I said, \u2018There is absolutely nothing wrong with this ballpark. I love it,\u2019\u201d Greer said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I feel, felt in 1994, the way I feel today about it.\u201d\n\nAndrus won\u2019t really miss the heat, though.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Elvis Andrus wasn't going to sit out the season finale of the long-eliminated Texas Rangers, not even on a scorching afternoon that illustrated why Globe Life Park is getting replaced after just 26 seasons.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/yankees_rangers_baseball_76727_c0-160-3830-2393_s1770x1032.jpg?8e649b8735ff723711aa8e39d1aaa22cb57b1c0c", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
