She was meant to be a miniature pig, but she\u2019s not that miniature at all (Picture: Dave Evitts / SWNS)\n\nA warning to all those who see pictures of little teacup pigs snuffling around and think \u2018those are cute, I\u2019ll get one\u2019.\n\nA lot of animals sold as \u2018micro pigs\u2019 end up, well, not so micro.\n\nNigel Graham, 57, bought a cute little piglet as a birthday present for his wife Sam, 48, who is allergic to cats and dogs.\n\nThey were told it was a miniature pig that would grow no larger than 70lbs when they brought it home in 2014.\n\nGuess what? The pig grew quite a bit larger than that.\n\nGrace the pig now weighs in at 28 stone. She munches through \u00a320 of food each week and has taken over the bottom floor of the family\u2019s three-bedroom cottage after refusing to sleep in an outside sty.\n\nThe family has had to make quite a few adjustments to make having an unexpectedly massive pig in their house work for them.\n\nGrace in 2014, when the family brought her home (Picture: Dave Evitts / SWNS)\n\nNigel cut Grace her own pig-flap in a side door to allow Grace to come and go as she pleases, installed a step from the patio door to make it easier for the pig to leave the house, and bought Grace her own orthopedic mattress to lounge on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigel and Sam have also given up bacon, out of respect.\n\nDad-of-two Nigel, from Malvern, said: \u2018I got Grace as a birthday present for my Sam four years ago because she is allergic to cats and dogs.\n\n\u2018The place actually invite you down there to see mother and father and I met Grace who was two weeks old at the time and had to do a course on how to look after her.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a very legitimate business. I went down there, I picked her up and held her and decided to get her.\n\n\u2018Her parents were about knee high, which is the actual size of a fully grown micro pig.\u2019\n\nWeighin in at 28-stone, Grace is quite a bit larger than expected (Picture: Dave Evitts / SWNS)\n\nAs you\u2019d expect for an animal that big, Grace needs a lot of food. Grace eats three full meals a day as well as pig pellets, fruit and leftovers from the family, with her food costing around \u00a320 a week. She\u2019s quite a picky eater, too.\n\n\u2018She is quite spoilt and for dinner she will have rice pudding with jelly or tinned peaches or pineapple,\u2019 Nigel explains.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s particular though, if it has a bruise or a grub in it or something like that, she won\u2019t have it and will turn her nose up at it.\n\n\u2018She is not interested in carrots anymore, it\u2019s just too boring for her. She is very very selective in what she does eat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Most pigs are just thankful for whatever they are given but she\u2019s been so spoilt with us.\n\nShe\u2019s a real homebody and loves all the comforts of her life with Nigel and Sam (Picture: Dave Evitts / SWNS)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a bit like a kid, you want to eat stuff that you like, but things you don\u2019t like you don\u2019t want to eat.\u2019\n\nGrace also doesn\u2019t particularly like going outdoors, preferring all the comforts of staying home with her family and watching TV.\n\nYes, we do relate.\n\nNigel says: \u2018She will go outside but not if it\u2019s raining or it\u2019s windy. She\u2019s got quite used to her creature comforts and likes to stay cosy.\n\n\u2018If it\u2019s a nice day she will follow me out of the house and obviously when she needs to go to the toilet to do a wee or poo.\n\n\u2018She will hold it in for 19 hours if it\u2019s raining.\n\nThankfully her family love her whatever size she is (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018I built her a pen called Grace Land which has an insulated floor, insulated ceiling to make her nice and warm in the winter and cool in the summer.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s only been in there for two nights, so turfing her out there never came about.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, while Grace\u2019s size has been a bit of a shock, that hasn\u2019t stopped Nigel and Sam from adoring her. They think of her as a member of the family.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s our pet and we love her and I class her as a third daughter, to be honest,\u2019 says Nigel. \u2018She\u2019s part of the family.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great. She\u2019s not like a pig. It\u2019s no different than a dog or a cat, in fact she is cleaner than one of my daughters and shows me more love.\u2019\n\nMORE: Bodhi the adventure cat joins his owner for cross-country skiing and paddleboarding\n\nMORE: Jealous partners can easily sleuth through Google\u2019s new Pixel 4 phone\n\nMORE: Woman wears her wedding dress for adventures every weekend for a year\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Nigel and Sam adopted a miniature pig as a pet.
