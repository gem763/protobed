The letter, addressed to the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and signed by Representatives Elijah Cummings, Adam Schiff and Eliot Engel, accuses the president of \u201cstonewalling\u201d and says they were left \u201cwith no choice\u201d but to subpoena.\n\n\u201cIt appears clear that the president has chosen the path of defiance, obstruction, and cover-up,\u201d the letter reads, warning that failure to comply \u2013 even at the direction of the president \u2013 \u201cshall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry\u201d.\n\nUkraine texts show how Trump has warped the state department Read more\n\nThe House investigators also want Pence to give them documents that could shed light on whether he helped Trump pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the former vice-president and leading Democratic candidate for the 2020 nomination.\n\nAnother letter sent earlier by Schiff, Cummings and Engel \u2013 the chairs, respectively, of the House intelligence, oversight and foreign affairs committees \u2013 cites reports that a Pence aide may have listened to the 25 July phone call in which Trump pushed Ukraine\u2019s new president \u2013 who was waiting for hundreds of millions of dollars of US military aid that had been withheld \u2013 to investigate unfounded charges that Biden was involved in corrupt activities there.\n\nThe chairmen say they also want to learn more about a meeting Pence had on 1 September with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe letter says there are \u201cquestions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian president\u201d.\n\nThe development came as Trump said the White House was also preparing a letter \u2013 this one to House speaker Nancy Pelosi. Its intention is to formally object to the Democrats commencing their impeachment inquiry without an official vote on it in Congress \u2013 but admits that if a vote were held he believes it would pass.\n\nThe letter is expected to say the administration will not cooperate with the inquiry without that vote. Trump acknowledged that Democrats in the House \u201chave the votes\u201d to begin a formal impeachment inquiry, but said he is confident they do not have the votes to convict in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be issuing a letter. As everybody knows, we\u2019ve been treated very unfairly, very different from anybody else,\u201d he said.\n\nThe move appears to represent a fresh attempt to undermine and frustrate the impeachment inquiry, and comes after the explosive release of text messages between US diplomats and an assistant to Zelenskiy. The exchanges discuss Zelenskiy being told that a prestigious White House visit to meet Trump was dependent on him making a public statement vowing to investigate Hunter Biden, Joe\u2019s son, and lending credence to a Trump conspiracy theory about a Ukrainian role in the 2016 elections.\n\nTrump openly called on China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens this week, but he continued to deny wrongdoing on Friday, repeating his refrain there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d attached to the requests. The text messages reveal that this was not the understanding of US diplomats dealing with Ukraine.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump said the presidency gave him \u201can absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d\n\nIn response, Schiff, the intelligence committee chair, tweeted: \u201cIt comes down to this. We\u2019ve cut through the denials. The deflections. The nonsense. Donald Trump believes he can pressure a foreign nation to help him politically. It\u2019s his \u201cright.\u201d Every Republican in Congress has to decide: is he right?\u201d\n\nTrump, senior Republicans, and prominent conservative media figures are either counter-attacking or remaining silent.\n\nMost Republican senators remained quiet on Friday, but the 2012 presidential candidate and current Utah senator Mitt Romney issued a statement that said \u201cthe president\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling\u201d.\n\nAs the impeachment scandal continues to escalate, the House intelligence committee, one of six that are holding impeachment hearings into Trump\u2019s conduct, questioned the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, behind closed doors.\n\nAs Trump's lies reach new heights, has the media reached a tipping point? Read more\n\nRepublicans are aggressively questioning the absence of an official vote on impeachment prior to the inquiry formally beginning.\n\nIn announcing that the House was beginning the investigation, Pelosi did not seek the consent of the full chamber, as was done for impeachment investigations into former presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nPelosi swatted it back as unnecessary, saying the House is well within its rules to pursue the inquiry without taking a vote.\n\n\u201cThe existing rules of the House provide House committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations,\u201d Pelosi wrote Thursday in a letter to House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy after he, too, pressed for a floor vote.\n\nPelosi has sought to avoid a vote on the impeachment inquiry for the same reason she resisted, for months, liberal calls to try to remove the president: it would force moderate House Democrats to make a politically risky vote.\n\nAgencies contributed reporting", "description": "Top Democrats also request records from Mike Pence as Trump objects to impeachment inquiry being launched without House vote", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy", "Julia Carrie Wong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6be78bd1d6f39af47a1cccb859fbf8755345cc/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e2e65a2e153dbe2646cbd70046dfe203", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
