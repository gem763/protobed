This would be an \u201cadditional pressure\u201d on softening domestic demand, particularly exported-related manufacturing and services, it said.\n\nThe committee \u201csaw the need to closely monitor developments of exchange rates, capital flows, and impacts on the economy through various channels, as well as consider implementing additional measures at an appropriate timing if necessary,\u201d the central bank said.\n\nThe monetary authority took steps in July to curb short-term inflows, worried that a strengthening baht will add further pain to an export-reliant economy already being hit by the U.S.-China trade war. The currency has gained more than 7% against the dollar this year, making it the best performer in Asia.\n\nMore Steps\n\nAdditional currency measures could include continued relaxation of capital outflow regulations to encourage Thai residents to increase their portfolio investment abroad, the central bank said. It could also consider measures in collaboration with other organizations, \u201cincluding efforts to stimulate investment to reduce the elevated current-account surplus.\u201d\n\nThe comments came on the same day the baht rose to as high as 30.334 per dollar, the strongest level since June 2013. It was up 0.3% at 30.345 as of 10:33 a.m. in Bangkok.\n\nThe central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in September after reducing it to 1.5% in August.\n\nThe MPC \u201csaw the need to preserve policy space in order to cushion against possible risks in the future and deemed it necessary to monitor the impacts of the policy rate cut and fiscal stimulus measures on the economy,\u201d according to the minutes. The panel will be \u201cdata-dependent\u201d going forward, and will monitor growth, inflation and financial stability risks, it said.", "description": "Thailand Looks to Rein in Baht as It Hits 6-Year High", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic947705bc060eed81a31413db0062b4e8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
