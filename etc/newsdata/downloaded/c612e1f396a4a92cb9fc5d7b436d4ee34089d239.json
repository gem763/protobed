Roberts, Jr., right, and Rabbi Mark Lipson speak onstage at Temple Emanu-El in New York on Tuesday. (Cindy Ord/Getty Images/The Temple Emanu-El Streicker Center)\n\nInterviewing Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. during an event at Manhattan\u2019s Temple Emanu-El on Monday night, Rabbi Mark Lipson offered a critique of the legislative and executive branches that counterbalance Roberts\u2019s court.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re right,\u201d Roberts replied, to laughter. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment \u2014 that Congress and the executive branch weren\u2019t fulfilling their obligations \u2014nonetheless ran as an undercurrent to Roberts\u2019s remarks during the hour-and-a-half long discussion. He explicitly lamented that the court\u2019s decisions had come to be seen as inherently political, a function of the \u201cpolitically polarized environment\u201d in which we live, but also a function of the legislative and executive branches leaving a broad range of decisions to the justices.\n\nHe offered the example of Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, a 2006 decision in which the court determined that the EPA could regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act of 1970.\n\n\u201cYou would have hoped that some time between 1970 and 2010, the politics branches had addressed that very important question,\u201d Roberts said. Because they had not, the decision was left up to the court.\n\n\u201cWhen we come out with the opinion that said, yes, greenhouse gases can be regulated as a pollutant, it would be very reasonable for the man on the street to say the Supreme Court decided to regulate greenhouse gases,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWhen all we were doing is saying, \u2018This is what \u201cair pollutant\u201d meant when Congress passed the statute.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWe do seem to be getting more and more involved in every aspect of society in a way that would have been surprising to the framers of the Constitution,\u201d Roberts said at another point.\n\nAsked about his comments last year rejecting the idea that the court operated on partisan lines, Roberts again suggested that such misconceptions were a function of the same partisan politics that gridlock the legislative branch.\n\n\u201cWhen you live in a politically polarized environment, people tend to see everything in those terms,\u201d he said of assumptions that votes would break down along Republican appointee-Democratic appointee lines. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we at the court function and the results in our cases do not suggest otherwise.\u201d\n\nHe compared their work to the overtly political decision-making on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to think that our role is similar to the role of the political branches. That, for example, when we issue a decision coming out a particular way, it\u2019s because we like what we are upholding,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThat we particularly like the result and that we\u2019re voting for that. There isn\u2019t a lot of basic understanding that we\u2019re interpreting law. And on a regular basis we\u2019re upholding policies with which we don\u2019t agree.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 frustrations, though obvious, were layered with an insistence on the separation of the branches of government. At the outset, he explained the three layers of humility he applied to his work: awareness of his peers, awareness of history and awareness of the other branches of government.\n\n\u201cI am extremely conscious as I go about my job assessing acts of Congress for constitutionality, reviewing executive actions for the same, that the political figures in our government have been elected by hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 by millions of people \u2014 and they earn by that charter the authority to shape policy for the government,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI have been elected by nobody.\u201d\n\nAt one point, the audience seemed to anticipate that Roberts would make an even more pointed reference to the executive branch.\n\n\u201cBefore I sit down with Rabbi Lipson, I\u2019d like to reflect for just a moment on the calendar,\u201d he said, as he began his comments. \u201cI do not think that those responsible for inviting me here tonight knew that today \u2014 \u201d\n\nThe audience interrupted with applause and laughter, apparently expecting Roberts to refer to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s own exercising of Congress\u2019s constitutional powers.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t Roberts\u2019s point, though. Apparently Sept. 24 is a day on which a number of other justices were nominated to their positions.", "description": "Based on his comments at an event in Manhattan, Roberts also dislikes how the Court is dragged into politics at all.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PzXw3Tek95vCHrgU4g1XXfnp5B0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RDG75WG7F4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
