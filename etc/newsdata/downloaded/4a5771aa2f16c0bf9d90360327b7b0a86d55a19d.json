Except I\u2019m not really alone.\n\nOnce every few minutes, my TV beams out a report about what\u2019s on my screen to Samsung, the company that made it. Chances are, your TV is watching you, too, through a few nosy pixels on the screen.\n\nEver wondered why TV sets are getting so cheap? Manufacturing efficiency plays a role. But to paraphrase James Carville, it\u2019s the data, stupid. TVs have joined the ranks of websites, apps and credit cards in the lucrative business of harvesting and sharing your information. Americans spend an average of 3\u00bd hours in front of a TV each day, according to eMarketer. Your TV records may not contain sensitive search queries or financial data, but that history is a window to your interests, personality, joys and embarrassments.\n\nAnd they\u2019re grabbing it because, legally speaking, tens of millions of us gave our permission.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been on the hunt for what happens to my data behind the cloak of computer code and privacy policies. So I ran an experiment on my own Internet-connected Samsung, as well as new \u201csmart TV\u201d models from four of the best-selling brands: Samsung, TCL Roku TV, Vizio and LG.\n\n[Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question]\n\nI set up each smart TV as most people do: by tapping \u201cOK\u201d with the remote to each on-screen prompt. Then using software from Princeton University called the IoT Inspector, I watched how each model transmitted data. Lots went flying from streaming apps and their advertising partners. But even when I switched to a live broadcast signal, I could see each TV sending out reports as often as once per second.\n\nMany TV makers say tracking what we watch helps them provide helpful personalized recommendations. Right, and people read Playboy for the articles. TV tracking is mostly about filling in a missing chunk of data about our lives for advertisers and media companies. I tracked down some of the firms that buy it from TV makers. They told me it makes TVs more like Facebook, where content can be measured and ads can be better targeted and tracked for performance.\n\nAnd just as on Facebook, things can turn creepy. Data firms use your TV history to link up what you watch with what you do on your phone, tablet and laptop \u2014 even what you buy in stores. It\u2019s as if your TV can unhook itself from the wall and follow you around.\n\n\n\nTwo years after the Federal Trade Commission fined a TV maker for privacy violations, tens of millions of Americans are still using TVs that track what we watch. (Matt Chinworth/For The Washington Post)\n\nHere\u2019s the truly vexing part: Since 1988, watching TV has been one of the few private activities specifically protected under U.S. law. (Congress passed the Video Privacy Protection Act after reporters published Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork\u2019s video rental records.) In 2017, the Federal Trade Commission rebuked TV maker Vizio for being deceptive and unfair in tracking customer screens. The FTC told Vizio \u2014 and the entire TV industry \u2014 to be upfront and make it totally opt in.\n\nDon\u2019t recall opting in to TV tracking? Me, neither. Two-and-a-half years after the FTC took action, new TVs include more small print requiring you to click \u201cagree\u201d when you set them up. But the majority of American smart TVs still have tracking turned on, according to the TV companies.\n\nTVs were supposed to be a privacy regulation success story. Now they\u2019re looking more like a cautionary tale.\n\nA fingerprint for your big screen\n\nHow does a TV watch you back? Think of it less as a dumb box and more like a 65-inch computer.\n\nTrying to measure TV habits has long challenged the industry. Market research firm Nielsen famously signs up people to panels, but they\u2019re just a sample. Streaming services such as Netflix keep meticulous records about what we watch but are limited to their own product.\n\nA decade ago, the arrival of smart TVs with Internet connections and apps gave an engineer named Zeev Neumeier a new idea: have the TV itself report on everything that crosses its screen. \u201cWe built a better mousetrap,\u201d says Neumeier, now the senior vice president of technology at Inscape, the data division of Vizio. It\u2019s called \u201cautomatic content recognition,\u201d or ACR.\n\nNeumeier, whose company is under orders from the FTC to be transparent, was the only industry leader willing to sit down in front of a TV and explain how his company tracks me. (Others, including LG\u2019s ACR provider Nielsen and Sony partner Samba TV, wouldn\u2019t even answer questions on email.)\n\nOnce per second, Neumeier told me, Vizio TVs capture a fingerprint of what\u2019s on the screen. It looks like two dozen square bundles of pixels scattered around the screen, which the TV converts into a string of numbers. That string is what the TV beams back to Vizio, along with identifiers for your TV.\n\nVizio compares the fingerprint with a database of known content \u2014 like Shazam for video. The result is a second-by-second log of your TV time, which the firm sells to about 30 different companies.\n\n(Not everything you watch gets included. Vizio doesn\u2019t keep track when you\u2019re using the Netflix app, at the request of the streaming giant.)\n\nSamsung said its ACR technology also uses fingerprints but declined to be more specific. In my test lab, TVs including the Roku-branded TCL model asked to be logged in with my email address and transmitted snapshots of my entire screen. Good thing I wasn\u2019t watching anything more embarrassing than Betty White reruns.\n\nMany of the TV companies say they aren\u2019t violating our privacy, because ACR data technically isn\u2019t \u201cpersonally identifiable information.\u201d TVs, they say, are shared by an entire household.\n\nBut the firms do collect, use and share one other important piece of identifying information: your TV\u2019s Internet Protocol address. An IP address is your home\u2019s identity on the Internet, shared across all the gadgets you own (which are also gathering data about you). It\u2019s how they link up what you see on TV with the rest of your life.\n\n\n\nIn The Post's gadget lab, we tested the tracking built into TVs from LG, Samsung, TCL Roku and Vizio. (Jonathan Baran/The Washington Post)\n\nThe data trail\n\nACR data reveals a lot more than what\u2019s trending or popular. It\u2019s a tool for marketers to build a trail from what you binge to what you buy.\n\nWith so much more detail about who\u2019s watching what, advertisers can use ACR to better target messages. Samsung and Roku TVs comb the data to identify household interests, and then insert ads based on them right on your TV screen. (That\u2019s why those two firms say they don\u2019t \u201csell\u201d our personal information \u2014 they just make use of it, instead.) Who knows what judgments they\u2019ll make if they see you watch a lot of reality TV, CNBC or both.\n\n\n\nOur test Samsung TV reported TV data to a site called Samsungacr.com once every few minutes, according to data we collected using the Princeton IoT Inspector. (Geoffrey Fowler/The Washington Post)\n\nOther ACR firms, like Sony\u2019s partner Samba TV, use the data to re-target ads you see on TV across your computer and phone. (Smart advertisers also use the data to avoid annoying you by repeating the same ad.)\n\nACR data also lets marketers match what people watch with other data sources \u2014 apps, loyalty cards, you name it \u2014 to help measure the effectiveness of ads. They want to know exactly how many Ford ads people saw before they bought one.\n\nIt\u2019s not always \u201cyou\u201d they\u2019re after; sometimes it\u2019s aggregated, statistical models of people who act or watch TV like you. And placing personalized ads on the TV is still in its early days, ad execs warn.\n\nBut just imagine the possibilities in elections. While it\u2019s not common yet, using ACR and voter databases, campaigns could know which shows persuadable voters watch most \u2014 even when the programs have nothing to do with politics.\n\nHow does any of this benefit us? \u201cIf you want great TV, then the TV industry needs to monetize itself,\u201d says Vizio\u2019s Neumeier. \u201cAnd ACR data allows them to do that in a way that is privacy-compliant and respectful of the user.\u201d\n\nWith better data, he says, we\u2019ll get more-relevant ads, and networks will get paid more for their ads \u2014 which could lead to better shows and maybe even fewer commercial breaks.\n\nBut I\u2019m still not convinced that tracking is a good deal for us. Making network ads work more like online ads also could make TV terrible. And it puts one more trove of data about our lives in the hands of companies that could misuse it \u2014 or manipulate us.\n\n\n\nThe ACR opt-in menu for Vizio TVs describes how the technology works in short chunks. (Jonathan Baran/The Washington Post)\n\nDark patterns\n\nHow many people would consent to that? According to these companies, the vast majority of us. And unfortunately, that\u2019s good enough for the government, too.\n\nWhen the FTC settled with Vizio in 2017, it said the TV maker had to clearly and conspicuously disclose how it captured TV data.\n\nNeumeier, only partly in jest, calls the opt-in menu for Vizio TVs the achievement he\u2019ll tell his grandchildren about. The menu, developed through lengthy negotiation with the FTC, is titled \u201cViewing Data\u201d and explains how ACR works in a hundred words, packaged into four chunks.\n\nThe \u201cAccept\u201d button is preselected, but you do have to press it to continue setup. Declining doesn\u2019t deactivate any of the useful functions of the TV.\n\nToday, nearly 90 percent of Vizio TV owners opt in. Neumeier calls that a \u201cgood number.\u201d Enough people are saying no to show they understand it, he says \u2014 but not enough to indicate people really find the idea distasteful. \u201cYou opt in because you generally don\u2019t mind, or are in fact happy that your data is helping the TV industry,\u201d Neumeier says.\n\nI suspect Vizio owners aren\u2019t putting that much thought into it. The implications of ACR took me weeks to unravel, and this is my job. More to the point: Why would so many people say yes when we get so little immediately in return?\n\nIndustry consultant Alan Wolk says when his firm TVRev surveyed consumers about ACR in 2017, it didn\u2019t find much concern. \u201cThe basic attitude was, \u2018Google tracks everything I do,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201c\u2018If Samsung or Vizio know that I watch \u2018Blackish\u2019 and \u2018The Tonight Show,\u2019 who cares?\u2019 If anything, the attitude was, \u2018Good, maybe my favorite show won\u2019t get canceled if they know I am watching.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNeumeier and I agree on one thing: Vizio\u2019s post-FTC disclosures are clearer than the other TVs I tested, which make you feel as if you don\u2019t even have a choice \u2014 not unlike the terrible default settings on Facebook.\n\nRoku TVs make it impossible to separate ad-tracking from smart-TV functions like show recommendations. Its ACR opt-in menu is titled \u201cA Better Smart TV Experience from Roku,\u201d and has \u201cUse this info to enhance TV viewing\u201d pre-checked for you.\n\n\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve been thoughtful in our implementation,\u201d spokeswoman Diane Carlini says.\n\n\n\nThe ACR opt-in on Samsung TVs buries information about the technology in \"Terms & Conditions.\" (Jonathan Baran/The Washington Post)\n\nSamsung buries ACR permission under the heading \u201cTerms & Conditions\u201d \u2014 a giant red flag for DO NOT READ. \u201cI agree to all\u201d is also preselected. When I set up my own Samsung TV, I didn\u2019t even realize I could say \u201cno\u201d to any of this.\n\nTwo-and-a-half years after the FTC took action, I can\u2019t imagine this is the result that regulators were hoping for. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a real meeting of the minds here where people are saying let my TV habits be collected,\u201d says Justin Brookman, a former FTC official who now directs privacy and technology policy for Consumer Reports.\n\nCompanies know we\u2019re easily bamboozled by what are called \u201cdark pattern\u201d designs that make you choose things that aren\u2019t in your best interest.\n\nYou can change your TV\u2019s settings after the fact. Many makers bury the settings in out-of-the-way menus such as \u201cTerms and Policy\u201d on Samsung TVs. Consumer Reports offers a detailed model-by-model guide.\n\nShould we really have to read the fine print on an entertainment device? Drawing the privacy line at \u201cconsent\u201d puts a lot more power in the hands of companies than consumers. Why not limit some kinds of data collection altogether?\n\n\u201cWe enforce the laws that we have,\u201d says Kevin Moriarty, who was the FTC\u2019s lead attorney on the Vizio case. \u201cThe law as we have it is focused on allowing consumers to make decisions about how their data is used.\u201d\n\nThe FTC hasn\u2019t announced any additional actions against TV makers. But it has recommended that Congress enact legislation to give it more tools to protect consumer privacy.\n\nWaiting on Congress to figure out how to protect our privacy feels like a bad rerun.\n\nRead more from our Secret Life of Your Data series:\n\nAlexa has been eavesdropping on you this whole time\n\nIt\u2019s the middle of the night.
