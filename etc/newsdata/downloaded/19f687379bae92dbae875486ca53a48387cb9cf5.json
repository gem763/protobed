McLaurin became the first wideout to have at least five catches and a touchdown in his first three games.\n\nThe 2018 third-rounder caught six passes for 70 yards and a touchdown. Through three games, he leads the Redskins in receptions (16), targets (24), receiving yards (257) and touchdowns (3).\n\nMcLaurin, though, shrugged off his accomplishments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a win-loss kind of guy,\u201d McLaurin said. \u201cSo when I scored, we lost. At the end of the day, what I want to do is come out here and be productive for my team. I\u2019m trying to do that to the best of my ability. At the end of the day, I want to win and we all want to win. In the box score, it doesn\u2019t say \u2018Terry had a great game, it says \u2018the Redskins lost.\u2019 I feel like that. Our team feels like that. That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d\n\nAgainst the Bears, the 24-year-old hauled in a 15-yard touchdown between two defenders, displaying an impressive set of hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcLaurin showing how strong his hands are on the TD.
