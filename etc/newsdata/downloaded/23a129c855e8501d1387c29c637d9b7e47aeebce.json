despite footage of him having sex on a yacht being leaked online just days earlier.\n\nZsolt Borkai, who won a gold medal in gymnastics at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and is married with two children, has apologised for actions he called a 'mistake' after an explicit video of him having sex with a young woman appeared online last week.\n\nThe disgraced politician, 54, however, said he would continue as mayor of Gyor in northern Hungary after he was re-elected on Sunday.\n\nBorkai then revealed on Tuesday he had quit the ruling Fidesz party - led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban - in order to limit the political fallout from the video.\n\nZsolt Borka, 54, said he would continue as mayor of Gyor in northern Hungary after being re-elected on Sunday despite footage of him having sex on a yacht leaking online (pictured)\n\n'The events around me should not put Fidesz at a moral disadvantage,' Borkai told a news conference in Gyor.\n\nHe added in a video message released last week that the footage on the yacht was 'in part manipulated and in part genuine', but did not deny having sex with the young woman.\n\nIt is unclear who shot the video or why it was taken during what Borkai described as a private trip on the yacht in the Adriatic Sea.\n\nThough Borkai was re-elected in Gyor, Fidesz suffered its first election setback in a decade on Sunday when a coalition of opposition parties ousted the mayor of Budapest in a municipal election and Fidesz lost ground in big cities.\n\nBorkai, who won a gold medal in gymnastics at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and is married with two children, has apologised for actions he called a 'mistake'\n\nViktor Orban's (left) eight-year rule over Hungary has come under threat since the release of Borkai's (right) orgy\n\n'The scandal was one of the factors that contributed to the opposition gaining ground in the election, as it dealt a blow to Fidesz's campaign on Christian family values,' the Political Capital think-tank said.\n\nViktor Orban's chief of staff last week dubbed the release of the sex video the 'low point of Hungarian political life'.\n\nAnother explicit video was also leaked online featuring an opposing politician, Tamas Wittinghoff, who is the mayor of a town near Budapest.\n\nBoth men said they had apologised to their families but confirmed they had no plans to abandon their candidacies at the time.\n\nOrban's chief of staff called the release of the sex videos the 'low point of Hungarian political life'\n\nBorkai was allegedly accompanied by a male friend, Zoltan Rakosfalvy, and a number of prostitutes on a yacht trip around the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Dubrovnik.\n\nReports also said that two videos, which reportedly appeared on the world's largest adult site, Pornhub, have since been taken down.\n\nHowever, the footage has since leaked onto other pornographic sites.\n\nBorkai initially denied his involvement and accused the opposition of planting the footage but has since issued an apology and admitted to taking part in the orgy.\n\nAt first the right-wing politician said: 'I consider the lies published about me to be part of an opposition campaign aimed to divert attention away from their own incompetence.'\n\nBorkai was allegedly accompanied by a male friend, Zoltan Rakosfalvy, and a number of prostitutes on a yacht trip around the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Dubrovnik\n\nIt is unclear who shot the video or why it was taken during what Borkai described as a private trip on the yacht in the Adriatic Sea\n\nHungarians chose between over 3,100 mayors and 16,000 councillors nationwide in Monday's vote, which was expected to have serious consequences ahead of a parliamentary election in 2022.\n\nThe opposition party, Momentum, seized the opportunity to win voters over by putting up posters saying 'public funds, cocaine, whores', to contrast with the ruling party's slogan of 'God, nation, family'.\n\nHungary's ruling elite usually manage to drown scandals involving the ruling party but the sex tape slipped through the net.\n\nEven if the opposition party manages to make big gains in the election, it will still be an uphill battle to overtake Orban.\n\nOrban, who has been in power for eight years, counts on the EU's economic growth, surging wages and propaganda to keep him in power.\n\nHe has pledged to financially punish cities if they switch political allegiances.", "description": "Zsolt Borkai, who won a gold medal in gymnastics at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and is married with two children, was re-elected as mayor of Gyor in northern Hungary on Sunday.", "authors": ["Faith Ridler", "Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/19/19633364-0-image-a-25_1570906041182.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
