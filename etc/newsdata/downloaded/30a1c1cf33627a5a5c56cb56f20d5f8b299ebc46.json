The drama, starring Jason Momoa and the inimitable Alfre Woodard, is set 600 years in the future after a virus has decimated humankind and rendered the remaining population blind. From what we can tell, the show looks like The 100 meets Bird Box, and will probably feature Jason Momoa doing his own stunts, so that\u2019s fun. Other than that, it is difficult to decipher what exactly is happening in this trailer. But perhaps that\u2019s the point? Perhaps\u2026 we are not meant to see this trailer at all?", "description": "See Trailer featuring Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard is part of Apple TV\u2019s new slate of original programming.", "authors": ["Charu Sinha"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/momoa_10.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
