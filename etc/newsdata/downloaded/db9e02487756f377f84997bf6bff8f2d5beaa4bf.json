There was some meaningless positive news about progress on China trade negotiations, but nothing else on the agenda that was likely to cause any significant movement.\n\nAction under the surface started off quite mixed. The indexes were driving the action, but small caps were struggling, breadth was weak and there was some rotation out of momentum names once again. Pockets of weakness were more pronounced, but the indexes were holding up.\n\nA little additional weakness crept into the action when President Donald Trump didn't sound particularly optimistic about quick and easy trade deals when he spoke at the United Nations, but the selling was accelerating as stops triggered at the lows of the day.\n\nWhen news hit that Nancy Pelosi would be formally looking at starting impeachment proceedings, the selling picked up steam and the indexes caught up with the weak action to the downside. This news isn't a huge surprise, but it creates chaos and uncertainty and foreshadows a nasty political war.\n\nPresident Trump announced he would be releasing a full transcript of his Ukraine phone conversation, which caused the indexes to spike back up, but they faded again as it became clear that was not going to be enough to stop the Democrats' inquiries.\n\nMuch political drama lies ahead and it will be interesting and entertaining to see how it develops. There are likely to be some market repercussions down the road, but there is no benefit in trying to guess how they will unfold.\n\nWhat is most interesting about the action Tuesday is that the market has been hinting that it wants to correct, but can't find a good reason. As I commented on Monday, the bears are going to need a new excuse, and it turned out that impeachment was the winner.\n\nThe S&P 500 pulled back close to its 50-day simple moving average and partially filled the gap on the chart created back on Sept. 5. There is still some support there, but this is the lowest close in 14 trading days and the potential for more downside is high.\n\nI suspect that the bears may overplay their hand as they contemplate the political issues, but there isn't any good reason to believe the market is suddenly going to reverse. There is going to be some news flow to jerk things around, but the wrangling will drag out and then the negotiations with China will move into the forefront again.\n\nIt has been a lousy market for stock pickers for a while, but the sell-off Tuesday will help to advance us to better opportunities. Patience is required, but the chaos will help provide better trading very soon.\n\nHave a great evening. I'll see you tomorrow.", "description": "When news hit that Nancy Pelosi would formally look at impeachment proceedings, selling picked up, but it's unclear how this will play out.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Impeachment Talk Shakes Up Market", "When News Hit That Nancy Pelosi Would Formally Look At Impeachment Proceedings", "Selling Picked Up", "But It'S Unclear How This Will Play Out.", "Bruce Kamich", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Chris Versace"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c50635da-d65a-11e9-822b-d397dcb79b74.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
