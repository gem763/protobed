People under retirement age suffer a 10% cut to their pensions, subject to a cap which ensures they receive at least 50% of their entitlements.", "description": "Britain's Pension Protection Fund (PPF) said on Monday it would assess the funding levels of Thomas Cook's retirement schemes, following the collapse of the world's oldest travel firm.", "authors": ["Carolyn Cohn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
