Ogwumike started for her sister Nneka, who was out with an illness that sidelined her for the second half of the team\u2019s last game against Las Vegas.\n\nChelsea Gray added 15 points.\n\nAfter trailing by 11 after one quarter, the Sparks rallied in the second quarter, took the lead in the third and held off Atlanta to move a full game ahead of fifth-place Chicago with two games to play.\n\nThe Sparks (20-12) have won 12 straight at home, where they play their last two games. Los Angeles coach Derek Fisher became the ninth WNBA head coach to get to 20 wins in their first season. The record is 29 by the Sparks\u2019 Michael Cooper in 2000.\n\nAtlanta shot 55% in the first quarter to 33% for the Sparks but a 7-0 run helped Los Angeles take a brief lead before the Dream took a 35-34 lead into the break. It was 51-45 for the Sparks after three quarters. The teams combined to go 7 of 40 from 3-point range.\n\nAlex Bentley, who did not score in the second half, and Elizabeth Williams each had 15 points for Atlanta (7-25). The Dream are having their worst season since their inaugural season of 2008 (four wins).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Candace Parker and Chiney Ogwumike each had double-doubles and Los Angeles overcame a slow start to beat the last-place Atlanta Dream 70-60 on Tuesday night in a game that put the Sparks in position to earn a first-round bye in the playoffs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
