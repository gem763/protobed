The industry average is $2.89, so we gave $635 million back to our customers,\" Murphy claimed.\n\nFidelity's decision on Thursday to drop trading commissions put it in the same boat as Charles Schwab, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade and Interactive Brokers, all which recently announced similar moves. While Fidelity isn't public, the other companies have seen their shares fall as the revenue drivers for the brokerages became even less clear.\n\nWhile it is not the biggest income source for online brokers, payment-for-order-flow is an increasing revenue stream. Schwab made $139 million from selling its customers' orders in 2018, up 22% from the previous year, according to regulatory filings analyzed by Reuters. TD Ameritrade was paid $458 million for customer orders in its last fiscal year, up from $320 million the year before.\n\nBoston-based Fidelity, which manages $2.8 trillion in assets, used to charge $4.95 for online stock trades. The zero commissions took effect Thursday for individual investors. They'll be available Nov. 4 for registered advisors.\n\nMurphy said she's not worried about Fidelity's margins taking a huge hit. \"We are a private company, so we make sure our margins never get too high frankly because we're always trying to give back value back to the customers.\"\n\nBrokers generally make most of their money through interest income on their clients' deposits.\n\n\u2014 Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this article.", "description": "\"Many competitors do to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars,\" says Fidelity's Kathleen Murphy.", "authors": ["Kevin Stankiewicz", "Jessica Bursztynsky"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105044121-GettyImages-143639486.jpg?v=1532563675", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
