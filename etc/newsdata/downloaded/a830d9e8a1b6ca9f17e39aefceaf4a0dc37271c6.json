When you do the maths, it's actually impossible for us to feed the planet,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the assumption that \"fake meat\" is healthier than the real thing, is warned against by Curtin University nutrition and public health researcher Christina Pollard.\n\n\"The problem is that often these products are not healthier than the meat-based original, because they are still heavily processed and high in fat and salt,\" Pollard said.", "description": "Australia's national science agency has teamed up with a fast food restaurant to develop a plant-based alternative to beef hamburgers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d867ba310cf3e97a04e93.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
