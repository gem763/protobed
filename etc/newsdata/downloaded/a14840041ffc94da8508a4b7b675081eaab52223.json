Each MP has been assigned a score between 0% and 100% based on their voting record, represented as a dot on the graphic below.\n\nThe lower the score, the worse the record. Where multiple MPs have the same score, the dots are clustered together.\n\nThe scores are accompanied, if applicable, by their declared interests related to fossil fuel companies, climate sceptics and airports.\n\nThis analysis is meant to be a starting point, rather than the final word. Due to the party whip system and arcane parliamentary rules, it cannot be a definitive guide to an MP\u2019s climate credentials. But it is a tool for voters to question whether their MPs are representing their climate concerns.\n\nThe votes and a list of relevant interests were chosen by the Guardian and DeSmog, in consultation with other experts, who also determined whether votes were pro-climate or not. Full methodology here.\n\nDespite parliament\u2019s support for ever greater long-term emissions-cutting goals, politicians have consistently shot down practical short-term measures. There have been occasional rebellions against the party whip \u2013 most dramatically during the 2018 Heathrow expansion vote. But nothing on the scale of Brexit, suggesting most MPs consider the climate a lesser priority.\n\nNote on methodology\n\nAnalysis: The approach used has certain limitations. Earlier this year parliament endorsed the Conservative administration\u2019s proposal to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050 and also approved a Labour party motion to declare a climate emergency. However, because these votes were passed by general assent, no voting record is available for either and they could not be incorporated into the scores.\n\nVotes: The 16 votes chosen for the analysis took place between 28 October 2008 (the third reading of the climate change bill) and 3 July 2019 (Heathrow north-west runway). MPs must have voted at least three times to receive a score.\n\nGraphic: When multiple MPs have the same score their respective dots stack up vertically on the graph. In cases where the number of MPs with the same score do not fit in the space available, an algorithm has rearranged them in clusters. The precise score can be seen by clicking on a dot, hovering the cursor over it, or searching for the MP\u2019s scorecard in the search box.\n\nParty affiliation: MPs are listed as belonging to the party they are affiliated with at the time of publication.\n\nFull methodology here.", "description": "Use our interactive tool to explore MPs\u2019 records on 16 climate votes", "authors": ["Pamela Duncan", "Antonio Voce", "Lydia Smears", "Jonathan Watts"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de6afe9a43f7ba2b28d81696d2a83190dd2b7ac8/0_0_833_500/master/833.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54cf2802994cc34dbdf1287d5fed81d1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
