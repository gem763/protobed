To commemorate the film, the folks at Vans (VFC) and Disney (DIS) collaborated on a 10-piece footwear and apparel collection.\n\nThe entire collection is as colorful and vibrant as the 1993 classic. Fans of Jack Skellington can wear a pair of Vans Sk8-Hi Jack\u2019s Lament, which retails for $75 and depicts the Pumpkin King cliffside, in a nod to one of the film\u2019s most iconic scenes.\n\nThe spooky seamstress Sally also gets a shoe of her own in what is perhaps the most unique offering in the collection. Priced at $85, the Vans Era Stacked gets the Sally Patchwork treatment. The ComfyCush Authentic comes in a neutral black-and-white tone and features many of the film\u2019s iconic characters layered on a checkerboard backdrop.\n\nVans 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' collection \u2014 VANS More\n\nIf depictions of ghouls, ghosts, and goblins were not enough to tickle kids\u2019 funny bones, the glow-in-the-dark elements featured on many of the shoes and clothing in the collection might.
