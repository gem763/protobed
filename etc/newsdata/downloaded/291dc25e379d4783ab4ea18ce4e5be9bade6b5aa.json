Kavanaugh, who now sits on the Supreme Court, was an undergraduate in the 1980s,\u201d the Times said. It also accused him of another sexual assault.\n\nBut alas \u2014 facts were wrong or scarce, corroboration of the accusation was faulty, and a very public blame game erupted in-house. The Times issued a lengthy rationale and response after readers questioned the reporting behind an accusation of sexual misconduct and \u201chow The Times presented the information.\u201d\n\nYes, well.\n\nTalk radio host Rush Limbaugh summarized his own reaction for 14 million listeners Tuesday by declaring that the venerable newspaper had simply devolved into a \u201cDemocratic Party political action committee\u201d and had been absent from journalism for quite some time.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. A simple review of a few headlines from the last 24 hours tells all, with \u201cbotch\u201d as the favorite operative term:\n\n\u201cHow did the New York Times botch the Brett Kavanaugh Story?\u201d (Reason); \u201cTimes reporters blame editors for omission in Kavanaugh story\u201d (Politico); \u201cCould Kavanaugh sue New York Times over allegation report?\u201d (Fox News); \u201cNew York Times reporters grilled about botched Kavanaugh story\u201d (CNN); \u201cNew York Times\u2019 political activism ignores fundamental ethics of journalism\u201d (National Review); \u201cTimes\u2019 latest smear is just another ugly warning to Kavanaugh\u201d (The New York Post); \u201cLindsey Graham, start fighting for justice for Brett Kavanaugh\u201d (The Federalist); \u201cWith stunning efficiency, The NYT is making an ironclad case that they\u2019re the enemy of the people\u201d (Townhall); \u201cJoe Scarborough blasts Kamala Harris for believing \u2018botched\u2019 and \u2018baffling\u2019 NY Times Kavanaugh essay\u201d (Mediaite).\n\n\u201cFrankly, \u2018botch\u2019 seems excessively kind for what happened here,\u201d notes Glenn Reynolds, the InstaPundit columnist for PJ Media.\n\nFOR THE LEXICON\n\n\u201cVamos to Victory.\u201d\n\nThat is the current motto of Latinos for Trump, a voter group very much in evidence during President Trump\u2019s rally in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, on Monday night. Campaign manager Brad Parscale, in fact, reveals that 40% of the rally registrants for the event were Hispanic \u2014 mirroring roughly the state\u2019s overall ethnic makeup.\n\n\u201cDemocrats take the Latino vote for granted, but the Trump campaign is determined to earn it,\u201d says Hannah Castillo, coalitions director for Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nTHE TEA PARTY: STILL BREWING\n\nAn event of note just outside the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon: Lawmakers and one of the nation\u2019s original tea party organizations will have a say on gun control. C-SPAN will cover this gathering at 3:30 p.m. EDT.\n\nWho\u2019s on hand for the event? Participants include Jenny Beth Martin, chairman of Tea Party Patriots Action; House Minority Whip Steve Scalise; Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and Andy Biggs of Arizona; and Patrick Neville, Republican leader in the Colorado General Assembly. They will respond to ongoing congressional attempts to limit Second Amendment rights.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s roster also includes Alek Skarlatos, a combat vet who helped foil a mass shooting by a terrorist on a Paris-bound train in 2015; Max Eden, co-author of \u201cWhy Meadow Died: The people and policies that created the Parkland shooter and endanger America\u2019s students\u201d; J.T. Lewis, brother of a Sandy Hook shooting victim; and Sheriff Frank Reynolds, a Colorado lawman and longtime personal security officer for high-ranking U.S. diplomats and military leaders.\n\n\u201cCall Congress, tweet, and post on other social media platforms about protecting our God-given rights to keep and bear arms,\u201d the Tea Party Patriots advises its 3 million motivated members.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Rifle Association advises that its 2019 World Shooting Championship begins Wednesday at the Peacemaker National Training Center in Glengary, West Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis competition is the all-encompassing test of shooting prowess,\u201d said Joe DeBergalis, executive director of NRA General Operations. \u201cThis event attracts some of the biggest names in the industry while remaining fully open to amateurs.\u201d\n\nCompetitors participate in \u201c3-Gun, High-Power Silhouette and Cowboy Action\u201d matches, among many other things during the three-day event.\n\n\u201cAt the end, one competitor will be crowned the undisputed world shooting champion,\u201d the NRA advises.\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nAnother victory in the ratings race for Fox News Channel: The network\u2019s audience throughout the day was more than both MSNBC and CNN combined last week, according to Nielsen.\n\nFox News also remains the most watched cable network for the 36th consecutive week, trumping non-news competition such as ESPN and HGTV. In prime-time, Fox News garnered 2.3 million viewers while MSNBC drew 1.4 million and CNN 745,000.\n\nSean Hannity remains the ratings dynamo with 3.4 million viewers for his show. Presentations of \u201cHannity,\u201d \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d and \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d delivered nine of the Top 20 cable telecasts in total viewers for the week.\n\n\u2018HOGAN\u2019S HEROES\u2019 GETS A REBOOT\n\nAnd now a word from Hollywood. The followers of the classic \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes\u201d TV sitcom are many and devoted. Now they must mull the fact that the iconic 1960s comedy will be resurrected. The good news is that the reboot will be ushered in by Al Ruddy, the original series co-creator.\n\n\u201cThe reimagined version will be a single-camera action adventure comedy series set in present day focusing on the descendants of the original heroes, now scattered around the world, who team up for a global treasure hunt,\u201d reports Deadline Hollywood.\n\nMr. Ruddy and the late Bernard Fein were the creative minds behind the original \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes,\u201d which lasted for 168 episodes on CBS from 1965 to 1971. The series followed Allied POWs imprisoned in a German prisoner-of-war camp who secretly used the camp to as a base for their own espionage missions.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 32% of U.S. adults say they own a gun \u2014 or about 81 million people.\n\n\u2022 61% of that group say their gun is for personal protection; 36% say it is for hunting.\n\n\u2022 13% use their gun for recreation; 8% for target shooting.\n\n\u2022 5% simply \u201clike guns\u201d; 5% say their gun is a \u201cSecond Amendment right.\u201d\n\n\u2022 5% say their gun is a family heirloom; 4% say owning a gun is a \u201cfamily tradition.\u201d\n\n\u2022 3% say their gun is related to their work in law enforcement or the military.\n\nSource: A Gallup poll of 840 U.S. adult gun owners conducted Aug. 15-30 and released Monday.
