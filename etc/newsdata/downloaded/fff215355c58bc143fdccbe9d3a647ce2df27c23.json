REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nGabriella Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her father Richard, who has led a campaign to try and get Nazanin released from prison.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very happy day,\u201d Richard Ratcliffe told a press conference held on Friday at the UK parliament, as Gabriella sat in his lap. \u201cIt has been a while in the making. We have obviously been toying with the idea of bringing Gabriella home for a while.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said it was very tough on his wife.\n\nIranian officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit.\n\nShe was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran\u2019s clerical establishment.\n\nHer family and the Foundation, a charity organisation that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and Reuters News, deny the charge.\n\nRichard set up the \u201cFree Nazanin\u201d campaign group and has lobbied the UK government to secure his wife\u2019s release from prison, but those calls have so far been dismissed by Tehran.\n\nIn June, Nazanin staged a hunger strike in prison and her husband staged his own hunger strike in London to highlight her plight and push for her release.\n\nGabriella has been living with family in Tehran.", "description": "The five-year-old daughter of jailed British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has arrived back in Britain to attend school after living in Tehran since her mother's arrest there in 2016.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439725804&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A1GI", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
