Leading up to that, it had stumbled for the better part of a year. On the same weekend one year ago, just 43.8% of 608 Sydney auctions sold.\n\nIt also gives some credence to the thesis that even as the number of auctions grows going into spring, high clearance rates can remain.\n\nREAD MORE: Sydney and Melbourne house prices are set to bounce despite low sales numbers. These two charts show why.\n\nMeanwhile in Melbourne, the AFL grand final weekend is a notoriously quiet one. Just 103 homes went under the hammer, with a preliminary clearance rate of 82.5% recorded. Last year those figures were 70 and 57.7% respectively.\n\nElsewhere, other capital city markets are trailing behind. Just over half of Brisbane\u2019s 85 auctions managed to sell, beaten by Adelaide\u2019s 69 at 62.2%. Canberra\u2019s wasn\u2019t too far off, with 55 auctions going ahead over the weekend, while only 10 faced the market in Perth.\n\nThose cities, unlike Melbourne, don\u2019t have footy fever to blame.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
