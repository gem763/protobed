I just felt he had ruined my life,\" she recalled.\n\nAt that point, Ms Hanzak had been diagnosed with post-natal depression and although she was receiving medication and support, she was still putting a \"mask on\" and pretending everything was fine.\n\nShe described how a \"slither of rational thought\" kicked in and she put her baby safely back in his cot before walking away and seeking help.\n\nMs Hanzak said her traumatic childbirth, sleep deprivation and the guilt she felt at being depressed led her to the brink of despair.\n\n\"I was used to life with ticks in the boxes,\" she said. \"I had everything. A nice house, a nice husband, a good career.\n\n\"It was a real wake up call for me that the biggest thing I ever wanted in life, which was to be a mum, was ultimately appearing to be what could be my biggest downfall.\"\n\nCampaigner Dr Smith said: \"We have a really good health service but that bit about crying often passes parents by and isn't focused on by professionals.\n\n\"In America and Canada they have programmes that reduce the (level) of abusive head trauma, but here we weren't doing anything and for me that needed to change.\n\n\"Our message is really simple. It's about saying infant crying is normal, it will stop and it's OK to walk away as long as your baby is safe.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with issues raised by this story, support can be found through BBC Action Line.\n\nInside Out (Yorkshire and Lincolnshire) examines the issue of shaken baby syndrome on BBC One at 19:30 BST on Monday 7 October and can also be seen afterwards on the iPlayer.", "description": "Hundreds of infants die from being shaken but experts say the full scale of the problem is unknown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/133CE/production/_109089787_mediaitem109089786.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
