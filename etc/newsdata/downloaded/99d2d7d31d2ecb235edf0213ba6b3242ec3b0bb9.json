This thing does practically everything you need for the perfect meal besides eating it for you. It\u2019s a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, saut\u00e9, yogurt maker, and warmer. And the family-sized 8Qt version is on sale for $80.\n\nThe Instant Pot DUO80 comes with 14 different one-touch presets to make your cooking even quicker. It\u2019s got a soup/broth button, a steam button, a pressure cook button, even a poultry button (no overcooked chicken here!). There\u2019s so much you can do with your Instant Pot. I made an Instant Pot French onion soup recipe and it lasted me through the week, taking it for lunch and eating leftovers for dinner. It was delicious and took practically a quarter of the time a traditional French onion soup takes.
