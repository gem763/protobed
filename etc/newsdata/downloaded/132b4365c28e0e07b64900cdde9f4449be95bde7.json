Where should I start?", "language": "en", "text": "Dear Rachel,\n\nI've been following your fitness journey on social media and would love to get into weight training like yourself! I do regular cardio and also enjoy yoga and pilates classes but I don't have a clue where to start with weights. My upper body strength is laughable and I'd love to get a bit stronger through using weights in my gym session. My gym also has a ladies section which is great for a beginner like me to get started without being intimidated, but I'm worried about using weights incorrectly or looking stupid \u2014 where did you get your ideas for weight training from? I don't want to have to fork out for a PT to show me as I really enjoy being independent in the gym and going at my own pace. Any help is much appreciated! Thanks.\n\n\u2014 Nervous Lifting Novice\n\nDear Nervous Novice,\n\nYAY! I can't tell you how happy it makes me to hear you want to get into weight training. So many women (and I'm presuming you are a woman based on your mention of the ladies section in your gym) are still afraid of lifting because they think it's only for men who want to build muscle, and won't help them lose fat, but in reality this couldn't be further from the truth.\n\n\"There's a myth that weight training leads to massive muscles, however as women we simply don't have the genetic makeup for this to happen,\" DW Fitness First Personal Trainer Hannah Bright told Insider.\n\n\"We lack the testosterone levels that men have and therefore weight training should not be feared by women as there as so many great benefits.\"\n\nResistance training won't make you bulky, but on the contrary it'll help create a lean, toned physique most people desire. If you want to lose fat, lifting weights is also essential because the more muscle mass you have, the higher your basal metabolic rate will be, meaning the more calories you burn at rest. This is scientifically proven.\n\nEqually, when you're in a calorie deficit, you really want to hold on to your muscle to ensure you're changing your body composition and reducing your body fat percentage in relation to your lean muscle mass.\n\nEndless studies have shown how beneficial strength training is for your overall health too (for example, reduced risk of osteoporosis, increased life expectancy, and improved mental health). And that's not even mentioning how practical it is in everyday life and how awesome it feels to be strong!\n\nBut hey, I don't need to convince you, do I? You've already decided you want to get into lifting. What a wise human you are.\n\nFirstly, please know that you are so not alone in feeling how you do \u2014 perhaps one of the most common questions I get asked by women is how to get into weights. I get it, a dark room full of grunting men pumping iron can be pretty intimidating, and the weights sections often aren't very welcoming to beginners.\n\nAlso, if you've been doing pilates, cardio, and yoga for some time, you're probably stronger than you think! Incorporating some lifting into your routine will improve your other activities drastically.\n\nRead more: 4 personal trainers warn that too much HIIT could be damaging to your health \u2014 here's what you should be doing instead\n\nYou're right to have reached out for help, though, as when it comes to lifting, you really need to make sure you learn the correct technique so you don't injure yourself.\n\nAs much as you might not want to pay for a PT, I genuinely believe it would be so worth it. At the very least, have one session with a trainer and ask them to teach you the basic compound moves: deadlifts, squats, shoulder press etc. Once you've learned those, you can expand your repertoire somewhat and teach yourself from books and online tutorials (make sure they're by someone legit, though), but it's honestly so worth having a pro show you the moves. A lot of gyms offer a taster PT session free, too.\n\nNot only will being taught the correct technique ensure you perform the moves correctly you don't get hurt, but it'll also massively boost your confidence.\n\nLaura Hoggins is a London-based strength coach. Laura Hoggins\n\nAny fitness professional will stress the importance of having someone qualified show you the ropes to get started.\n\n\"It's great to invest a bit of time and money into laying the foundations of confidence in the gym, get someone qualified and reputable to show you the ropes, and spend some time assessing your movement,\" Laura Hoggins, level 3 qualified strength coach and author of \"Lift Yourself,\" told Insider.\n\n\"They could highlight some things to be cautious of, refer you to a physical therapist, or guide you in the right direction when it comes to your chosen gym environment.\"\n\nWhen you feel like you know what you're doing, I promise you won't feel even remotely intimidated by those guys dominating the weight room. You'll be like, \"Excuse me but are you done with the squat rack? And no don't worry about taking any of the load off, that'll be my warm-up.\" [Insert sassy girl and bicep emojis here].\n\nRich Tidmarsh, owner and lead trainer of Reach Fitness in Clapham and Earlsfield, London, also stresses the value of learning the fundamentals from a professional.\n\n\"I think it's important that everybody realizes that weight training and getting strong, and the benefits associated with it, that all comes from acquiring skills. You cannot just go from zero to hero on this,\" he told Insider.\n\n\"If you don't want to fork out on personal training, does that mean you don't want to invest in yourself?\" Tidmarsh asks.\n\n\"You could upskill yourself quickly with the help of an expert ot reap the rewards over a period of time.\"\n\nRich Tidmarsh is the owner of Reach Fitness. Rich Tidmarsh\n\nTidmarsh points out that you could pay for one personal training session by skipping one night out, and doing so could equip you with skills and knowledge for the rest of your life.\n\nDividing the cost of a few sessions over multiple years, it's not much at all.\n\n\"Trying to learn how to do weights off Instagram is not the way to go \u2014 there are hundreds of trainers on Instagram who are all rubbish and all have poor technique, and you're not going to get anywhere with them,\" Tidmarsh cautions.\n\nIf you don't know how to move your body correctly, you're also less likely to see the results that you should, and so you're less likely to stick with it.\n\nI myself learned to lift by having a few sessions with Tidmarsh a couple of years ago, and the technique I learned with him has given me an excellent grounding for everything I've done in fitness since.\n\nIt was also useful for me to find starting weights, because otherwise, how do you know which dumbbells, kettlebell, or weight of any kind to pick up?\n\nSince then, I've had occasional PT sessions here or there to learn new moves (I'm not afraid to take those free introductory sessions when they offer on the gym floor!) and check my form is still on point, and I also go to strength-based group fitness classes where the instructors give pointers.\n\nIf you're on a budget and can't afford to go to a boutique studio, I'm sure your gym will have some classes that incorporate some strength and resistance training. These are increasingly being held on the gym floor, too, the thinking being that it'll help people familiarize themselves with the equipment and build confidence.\n\nWhile classes such as these shouldn't be considered a substitute for heavy lifting with proper rest periods, they can certainly complement your solo training and help boost confidence.\n\nThe basic moves to master come down to simple concepts: pushing, pulling, hinging. To start with, Tidmarsh recommends learning how to deadlift, squat, shoulder press, kettlebell swing, and do a bent-over row.\n\nHow many reps and sets you should do slightly depends on your goals, but as a beginner, all you really need to worry about is perfecting the technique.\n\nThe right number of reps in a set is where the final one is hard, but you're not working to failure. Then you need to take a rest period before doing another set.\n\nYou then get stronger by applying the principle of progressive overload, which essentially means gradually increasing either the weight or the number of reps.\n\nRead more: 5 crucial exercise lessons I learned when I cut my body fat nearly in half in 6 months without losing my muscle\n\n\"In order to meet the training goal of strength development, we must challenge the muscles in new and different ways,\" Hoggins explained.\n\n\"The basics work, and in time you can start to add a little bit of intensity as the weeks and months go, but remember this doesn't have to be huge progress every week!\n\n\"You may find you experience large improvement quickly, and that's OK, but just make sure you focus on quality over quantity and you are recovering well from each session.\"\n\nTrack your workouts, and it'll be incredibly satisfying to see yourself achieving more and more.\n\n\"We were all once a beginner,\" Hoggins said, and even she says she was \"pretty terrified of the barbell\" when she first began weight-training.\n\n\"Find where you are starting and go from there, safely and comfortably!\"\n\nWishing you well,\n\nRachel\n\nAs INSIDER's Senior Lifestyle Reporter and a self-confessed fitness fanatic, Rachel Hosie is fully immersed in the wellness scene and is here to answer all your burning questions.
