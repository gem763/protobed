The community was excited to greet the royal couple, and Meghan received a lovely welcome from one of the children, who gave her a big hug just after the Sussexes arrived at the Nyanga Methodist Church.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Chris Jackson - Getty Images More\n\nThe Duke and Duchess touched down on a scheduled British Airways flight late this morning before making their way to their undisclosed residence with members of their 13-strong entourage.\n\nAfter dropping off baby Archie, they visited the Nyanga township to see the work of an initiative that teaches children about their rights and safety. The township has been labeled the \"murder capital of South Africa\" for its high crime rates.\n\nLooking refreshed despite their overnight flight, Harry and Meghan were greeted by Jessica Dewhurst who founded human rights organization Justice Desk as well as community leader Theodora Luthuli.\n\nPhoto credit: Chris Jackson - Getty Images More\n\nThe organization provides young people with information about their rights, self-awareness, and safety, and provides self-defense classes and female empowerment training to young girls in the community. The Justice Desk is supported by the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Trust of which Harry is president and Meghan is vice president.\n\nFocusing on women\u2019s empowerment is a priority for Meghan on this tour, and the couple wasted no time highlighting the cause straight away. They are scheduled to observe the Mbokodo Girls\u2019 empowerment program which provides support to young women who have suffered major trauma. The project\u2019s motto is 'Wathint' Abafazi, Wathint' Imbokodo' (when you strike a women; you strike a rock).\n\nThe session will begin with the students reciting \u2018Our Deepest Fear,\u2019 the club\u2019s anthem. The girls will then break off into four training groups and Harry and Meghan will circulate and meet them. Later on, Harry and Meghan will both make speeches.\n\nTheir first day will conclude with a visit to District 6, where 60,000 residents were forcibly removed and relocated during apartheid. The couple will view the exhibition and hear about how the Cape Malay community lived in harmony until the forced separation.\n\nHarry and Meghan will meet the public on a short walkabout to the Homecoming Centre next door. There, they will join in with food preparations before sitting down to sample some of the cuisines that demonstrate the cultural diversity of District 6. During the meal, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will have an opportunity to hear from the residents, and their experiences of living in, and leaving the area.\n\nMeghan will then exchange a copy of Together, the Hubb Community Kitchen cookbook, with some of the contributors to the District 6 Cookery book.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The Sussexes' royal tour of South Africa kicked off this morning.", "authors": ["Victoria Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ErIDn9uNWo5ircA1_SVXOw--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9Mjg3MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/5eb7deb15a53c05c79489676b943913e", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
