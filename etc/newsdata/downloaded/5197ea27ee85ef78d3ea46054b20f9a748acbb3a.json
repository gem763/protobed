The husbands on older series such as Married ... With Children, The King of Queens, and even Everybody Loves Raymond seemed to crackle with one-sided resentment toward their beautiful but annoying wives. Those on more recent shows, such as Black-ish and even Modern Family, rarely pull their weight in their households. (And some of the most compelling family-oriented series of recent years, such as One Day at a Time and Better Things, are anchored by single mothers.)\n\nBut Schitt\u2019s Creek\u2019s Johnny Rose showers Moira in adoration. He gathers their children around the telephone to wish her well on her first day of shooting; he admonishes them not to touch her wigs because he knows the hairpieces matter to her. Even in moments of suspicion, Moira regards him with nearly unwavering amusement and affection. They laugh loudly and often. They are far more committed to each other than to their (adult) children, far more content to luxuriate in their romance than to see themselves as parents first. (In this, they diverge markedly from Catastrophe\u2019s Rob and Sharon, who were consumed by the task of raising young children for much of the show\u2019s four seasons.) Johnny and Moira\u2019s refreshing dynamic pays off for viewers, especially given how rare it is for shows to depict an older couple facing life troubles that aren\u2019t, as O\u2019Hara recently noted to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cjust about death, divorce, and disease.\u201d\n\nMuch of the actors\u2019 onscreen rapport can be traced to their long history of collaboration. O\u2019Hara and Levy first performed together in 1974, and they credit their shared artistic sensibility to Second City, the comedy theater where they first met. (O\u2019Hara, then a waitress, later went on to replace Gilda Radner.) Though their own brief romance didn\u2019t last, the pair played a couple in the 2000 comedy Best in Show, and ex-lovers in the 2003 mockumentary A Mighty Wind. When Levy and his son, Dan (who plays David, one of Moira and Johnny\u2019s children), initially conceived of Schitt\u2019s Creek, they knew O\u2019Hara was their Moira. \u201cShe was our first choice, yes. She\u2019s always our first choice,\u201d Eugene Levy told Vulture in 2015.\n\nThe Levys\u2019 trust in O\u2019Hara\u2014and the latter\u2019s admiration for Eugene\u2014shaped the process of writing and fine-tuning Moira both before and during filming. In a 2014 joint conversation with BuzzFeed News ahead of the show\u2019s release, O\u2019Hara spoke glowingly about \u201cworking with a friend who you love and respect.\u201d This sense of trust also animates the characters\u2019 marriage: Moira and Johnny are clearly a team who choose each day to face down their struggles together\u2014even when the place where they\u2019ve woken up that morning is itself the struggle. To the extent that they express frustration toward each other, the root cause is usually one partner\u2019s failure to inform the other of new burdens so that they can be shared.", "description": "One of the Emmy-nominated sitcom\u2019s secret strengths is its portrayal of long-term partnership\u2014as a bond that is as eccentric as it is affectionate.", "authors": ["Hannah Giorgis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/1247931659_SC5_Ep502_D3_IW_0085_R/facebook.jpg?1569074400", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
