Fed's Kashkari Says Not Clear How Many Rate Cuts Economy Needs\n\n(Bloomberg) -- One of the Federal Reserve\u2019s most outspoken policy doves said the U.S. central bank should be supporting the economy given downside risks to the outlook, and it\u2019s not clear yet how many more interest-rate cuts will be required to do so.\n\n\u201cAs the economy appears to be showing more risks, business investment is slowing, the global economy is slowing, and inflation continues to come in below our target, my message is clear: We should be supporting the economy, not tapping the brakes,\" Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that we\u2019re cutting interest rates. I don\u2019t think we should have been raising them,\" Kashkari, who in recent years has been a dissenting voice against Fed tightening, told an audience in Prior Lake, Minnesota. \u201cHow much more do we have to cut? I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nThe once-red hot U.S. labor market is losing steam and data show weak activity in the services and manufacturing industries, as businesses become more cautious amid uncertainty over U.S. trade policy and weaker global growth. That\u2019s led investors to boost bets the Fed will cut interest rates again later this month following reductions in September and July.\n\nThe Minneapolis Fed chief doesn\u2019t have a vote this year on rate decisions made by the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, but he will in 2020. Two of Kashkari\u2019s more hawkish FOMC colleagues, who are voters this year, took a different stance.\n\nSpeaking over the weekend, both Kansas City Fed President Esther George and the Boston Fed\u2019s Eric Rosengren singled out consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of the economy, as a key variable. They said that so long as it remained vibrant there was no need to add additional accommodation, even as the manufacturing sector suffers and the trade war weighs on sentiment. They both dissented against the Fed cuts in July and September.\n\n\u201cIf the economy grows at 1.7%, consumption continues to be strong, inflation is gradually going up and the unemployment rate is at 3.5%, I would not see a need for additional accommodation\u201d at the Fed\u2019s October or December policy meetings, Rosengren said on Saturday. He downgraded his growth forecast from 2% but said that overall, \u201cthe economy is right where we want it to be.\u201d\n\nChairman Jerome Powell has been under relentless public pressure from President Donald Trump to reduce rates. On Friday, Powell gave no clear signal as to whether he favors the FOMC delivering another cut this year, saying that the economy was in a \u201cgood place\u201d but faced risks.\n\nHe did not discuss the economy in brief remarks that he made on Monday, but is expected to do so in a speech Tuesday at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics in Denver scheduled for 2:30 p.m. New York time.\n\nAt the September FOMC meeting, just seven of the 17 participants projected another rate cut following reductions at the prior two meetings.\n\nRosengren, who spoke on the sidelines of a Boston Fed conference, said the one factor that may change his outlook is the American consumer, who could pull back on spending if the stock market were to drop sharply, or if gloomy headlines over trade and geopolitical tensions mount.\n\nGeorge suggested she\u2019d be flexible if data look worse than she expects.\n\nThe Kansas City Fed chief also said she didn\u2019t believe falling short of the 2% inflation target over much of the past seven years was a concern, partly because conversations with people across her district suggest slight misses aren\u2019t an issue for ordinary Americans.\n\n\u201cThe unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, inflation is low and stable, and the economy is growing near potential,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the midst of the longest business cycle expansion in history, inflation running a few tenths of a percent below 2% is, in itself, not a compelling justification for providing additional monetary policy accommodation.\u201d", "description": "Fed's Kashkari Says Not Clear How Many Rate Cuts Economy Needs", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC341CJ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
