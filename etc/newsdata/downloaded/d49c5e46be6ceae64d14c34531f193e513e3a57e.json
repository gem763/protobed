We who admired him for so long expected much more from Rudy Giuliani and his legacy.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full interview above and the Times op-ed here.", "description": "\u201cThere was an old Rudy and a new Rudy,\" said former Giuliani campaign press secretary Ken Frydman.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9c3ebc2000008a054f2b23.jpeg?cache=gff0j9d4hi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
