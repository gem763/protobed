Those were the salad days for the titans of tech: Digital billionaires were superheroes feted on magazine covers and in the White House, not super villains hauled before Congress for fixing elections, sowing genocide, undermining truth and monopolizing all the globe\u2019s commerce.\n\nAt the time, Theranos was a promising medical start-up and Uber looked like a slightly rough-around-the-edges solution to urban traffic. Bill Gates was the world\u2019s greatest philanthropist, and you\u2019d have been laughed out of town for suggesting \u2014 as presidential candidates and billionaires themselves now routinely do \u2014 that people as rich as him should not even be allowed to exist. This month both The New Yorker and the Atlantic published lengthy investigations into Jeff Bezos\u2019 designs on owning basically everything. In 2014, the Amazon founder was hardly so existentially menacing; he seemed happily married, most decidedly not jacked, and he wasn\u2019t even close to being the richest man in the world. LOL, he was poorer than Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe stakes were smaller then, is what I\u2019m saying. Over five seasons, \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has been viciously precise in lambasting techies\u2019 antisocial foibles, but as to the industry\u2019s fundamental contribution to the world, the series has mostly aped the zeitgeist, handling tech with loving, kid gloves. The gang of awkward bros who are trying to make it big with Pied Piper, the show\u2019s heroic central start-up, have always been mostly good dudes, at least compared to their real-life start-up bro analogues. They weren\u2019t abetting Nazis. They weren\u2019t breaking democracies, or taking money from murderous petromonarchs. Compared to pop cultural portrayals of the nation\u2019s other power centers \u2014 to Wall Street, Hollywood or D.C. \u2014 \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d long found in Silicon Valley some capacity for inspiration, wonder and awe.\n\nBut in much the same way that later seasons of \u201cVeep\u201d had to amp up an atmosphere of dystopian peril to match the real-life descent of American politics, HBO\u2019s tech satire has also had to adjust. Society is now drowning in tech, and as we\u2019ve all curdled in the glare of our phones , \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d got more sour, too. This works well as a story arc for a show set in the tech industry: Though Pied Piper has always been an idealistic company (fake idealism is the whole joke about this place), each season brought new avenues to abandon its ideals \u2014 the time they signed up thousands of fake users, or when their software caused phone explosions that injured their customers\u2019 genitals.", "description": "In its final season, the HBO satire asks the big questions: Can good coexist with greed? Does money ruin everything \u2014 and how much does that matter, if we\u2019re talking billions?", "authors": ["Farhad Manjoo"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/arts/27silicon-valley1/27silicon-valley1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
