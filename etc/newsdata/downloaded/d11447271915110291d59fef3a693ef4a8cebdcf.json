The scene was similar, though: a wild celebration on the Navy sideline.\n\nNichols wound up perched on his teammates\u2019 shoulders, his kick securing Navy\u2019s bowl eligibility for the 15th time in 17 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him make that kick a lot in practice. You know, at the end of practice everybody\u2019s screaming, everybody\u2019s trying to get in his head, trying to emulate that situation on the field,\u201d quarterback Malcolm Perry said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him do it before, and I was really confident in him, but, um \u2014 my eyes were closed.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing left for Perry to do at that point. The quarterback had done his job and gotten Navy into field goal range with under a minute left on the clock with a seven-play, 44-yard drive that hinged on his 21-yard scramble. In what was a breakout game from sophomore fullback Jamale Carothers, the scramble was one of Perry\u2019s few big runs of the night.\n\n\u201cI had a really good feeling our offense was going to get me in range if not score, so I knew to be ready,\u201d Nichols said. \u201c . . . It\u2019s just so much fun to be a part of the brotherhood, be at the academy, and \u2014 I did not expect this when I showed up for [Induction Day].\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNavy Coach Ken Niumatalolo usually centers the ball for field goals but kept it at the left hash, Nichols\u2019s preferred spot, for the game-winning kick.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as talented a kicker as we\u2019ve ever had \u2014 he\u2019s a cool-for-school kid, though,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cThe way he talks, his monotone voice, that\u2019s him. He\u2019s easygoing. Nothing little rattles him. . . . You need a kicker like that, who doesn\u2019t get rattled and has some ice in his veins. I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\n\nNiumatalolo also praised the resolve of the rest of his team, which withstood a furious Green Wave rally to improve to 6-1, 4-1 in the American Athletic Conference.\n\nPerry and Carothers led an offense that controlled the first half, building a 24-0 lead and taking a 31-14 margin into intermission.\n\nAD\n\nThe offense screeched to a halt in the second half, however, and Tulane quarterback Justin McMillan\u2019s one-yard run with 61 seconds left tied the score at 38, setting the stage for Perry and Nichols in the game\u2019s dying moments.\n\nAD\n\nCarothers rushed for a career-high 154 yards and three touchdowns on 14 carries. Perry rushed for 142 yards on 22 carries and completed 2 of 7 passes for 68 yards and a touchdown. He also threw an interception.\n\nNavy gained 453 total yards to 477 for Tulane (5-3, 2-2).\n\nThe first half began as a virtual clinic for the Midshipmen, who scored touchdowns on their first three drives (a 52-yard run from Carothers, a 35-yard run from Carothers and a 31-yard catch by \u2014 who else? \u2014 Carothers, from Perry). Tulane went three-and-out on each of its first three drives.\n\nAD\n\nTulane\u2019s defense found its footing in the third quarter, and the Green Wave trimmed its margin to 31-28 by the start of the final quarter.\n\nMcMillan, a graduate transfer from LSU, completed 20 of 29 passes for 290 yards and three touchdowns. He threw two interceptions, including one that sophomore linebacker Diego Fagot returned for a touchdown in the second quarter, and was sacked four times. Tulane was without top rushers Corey Dauphine (wrist injury) and Darius Bradwell (leg injury) for the second week in a row.\n\nAD\n\nThe Green Wave stormed back without them, and Navy\u2019s defense blamed the poor second half on too many missed assignments and too many missed tackles.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHopefully we don\u2019t have too many more of these games. I don\u2019t know if I can handle more of these,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cJust proud of our kids, their resilience and their fight. That\u2019s a great win, and after last year, it\u2019s great to be bowl eligible. I\u2019m never going to take that for granted again.\u201d\n\nRead more on college football:\n\nAD", "description": "Freshman kicker delivers, capping off a late drive fueled by Malcolm Perry\u2019s key scramble.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0ohJq5ogxfPkhF4raxbxP3KFZGk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SQTY5JXYLUI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
