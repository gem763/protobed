But the climate crisis has increasingly turned some days into a special kind of hell. For the county\u2019s 10 million residents, the month of October, when blistering heat and dangerous winds combine to make the threat of catastrophic fires a daily reality, has become particularly worrisome.\n\nAcross southern California this week, residents were coping with what scientists and government officials say is the \u201cnew normal\u201d in autumn: debilitating heat, an endless fire season, mandatory mass evacuations and forced power shutdowns to prevent new blazes.\n\nA heatwave this week turned the city of Anaheim, home to Disneyland, into the hottest place in the United States. The Tick fire forced 50,000 people to flee their homes, many in the middle of the night. And with strong winds and temperatures nearing 100F (38C), authorities are bracing for continued fire hazards heading into the weekend. The utility company Southern California Edison proactively shut off power to more than 24,000 customers in five counties on Thursday and could cut power to more over the weekend.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A helicopter makes a water drop to help fight the Saddleridge fire north of Los Angeles.

The Saddleridge fire north of the city burned nearly 9,000 acres (3,642 hectares), forced 100,000 people to evacuate, destroyed dozens of homes, and blanketed the city with dirty and dangerous levels of smoke. And a separate brush fire in Pacific Palisades threatened multimillion-dollar homes near the beach.\n\n\u201cMy dad has a horrible cough, my mom has eye problems, we all have damage to our respiratory systems,\u201d said Maddhi Jayagoda, whose family survived the Holy fire in southern California last year. The extreme conditions of the past weeks have given the 25-year-old flashbacks to fleeing flames. But her typical remedy to anxiety is often not an option \u2013 she can\u2019t go on a run when air is so toxic, it hurts to breathe.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anywhere else we can go,\u201d said Jayagoda, who works at an ad agency in West Hollywood. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re just stuck having to deal with this.\u201d\n\nThe hazards are on track to get much worse.\n\nLA has long been notorious as one of the worst cities for pollution, smog, and traffic, though the state as a whole has made progress in recent years in reducing emissions. But the crisis of wildfires, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, has dramatically derailed that progress.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Palm trees burn in a fire burned about 40 acres in Los Angeles.

The climate crisis has created conditions across the American west more favorable for wildfires, including drier and warmer forests.\n\n\u201cNow we can have wildfires anytime of year,\u201d said Ed Avol, clinical medicine professor and air pollution expert at the University of Southern California. \u201cThey seem to be longer, more serious and more persistent \u2026 This is becoming a regular way of life for us.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the expansion of housing in and around high-risk areas in southern California has escalated the risks of fires and put more people potentially in harm\u2019s way.\n\nThe long-term health effects of fire exposure are uncertain, Avol said.\n\nBut it is clear that this new norm of heat and bad air looks dramatically different for different populations, in a region plagued by extreme income inequality, poverty, and health disparities.\n\nWhile wealthier neighborhoods and coastal areas tend to enjoy more shade, air conditioning and breezes, inland suburbs regularly overheat and expose lower-income residents to extreme temperatures indoors and outside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Smoky air spreads through much of Los Angeles from a wildfire.

Rita Dunn, a 39-year-old woman who has been homeless and living outside for about two years, is currently sleeping in a makeshift structure by train tracks in the San Fernando Valley, not far from the Saddleridge fire.\n\n\u201cI wore these goggles, but it\u2019s impossible to do anything, and you can\u2019t get away from it,\u201d she said, recounting the peak of the fire, which sent hot embers in her direction. She put bandanas on her three dogs to try to protect them from the toxins, but she wasn\u2019t sure it made much of a difference. \u201cWe just laid there, with ash raining down.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t evacuate: \u201cWhere would I evacuate to?\u201d This week, she\u2019s dealing with the aftereffects of the toxic air combined with heat nearing 100F (38C).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sitting here for the last three hours with my brain melting,\u201d she said on Tuesday, adding that one of her dogs lays next to her water tank to try to stay cool, while another digs a hole in the dirt. \u201cEvery second feels like a million years when you\u2019re having trouble breathing.\u201d\n\nAt Skid Row, the epicenter of the region\u2019s homelessness crisis in downtown LA, advocates said the heat was making public health emergencies even worse.\n\n\u201cPeople are accessing fire hydrants, because there\u2019s not enough water stations available,\u201d said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row. The heat exacerbates hygiene problems for people living in encampments, he said. \u201cWe are just leaving too many people too long on the street, and their health is fading.\u201d\n\nInside the URM, Kat Doherty, who has been homeless for several months, said she didn\u2019t know how people were staying alive in tents: \u201cI try to go quickly from one air-conditioned spot to another. It\u2019s really, really treacherous out there \u2013 the dehydration, the sun damage on their skin. And it definitely affects their mental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re breathing in ash. It\u2019s like you\u2019re smoking,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hikers in LA\u2019s Griffith Park look west where a layer of smoke from the Saddleridge Fire hangs in the sky.

It does something to your brain.\u201d\n\nWhen the temperatures get above 90F (32C), Joe Nicchi, who runs a popular ice-cream truck in the region, says his business suffers a noticeable drop. \u201cYou would think ice cream does well [in the heat], but people don\u2019t go outside. They go from an air conditioned car to an air conditioned house. We struggle.\u201d\n\nWorkers at Disneyland adjust their outfits \u2013 removing bowties, vests and other layers \u2013 when it gets this hot, said Chris Duarte, president of the union that represents the employees.\n\nFor day laborers and domestic workers, many of whom are undocumented and don\u2019t have health insurance, the fires can mean lost work, untreated illness, or hazardous jobs, said Maegan Ortiz, director of a not-for-profit that has assisted immigrant workers affected by the fires. Some workers tend to houses in wealthy neighborhoods after their employers have evacuated, she said: \u201cWe hear about these persistent coughs that won\u2019t go away, tightness in the chest, not feeling like you can breathe deeply.\u201d\n\nAt Griffith Park, a popular LA destination for Hollywood sign selfies, Tony Garcea said the bad air quality would not stop him from getting exercise: \u201cI almost passed out, but then I found some shade,\u201d he said as he stretched on a park bench. Asked about air pollution, he shrugged: \u201cIn ten, 20, 30 years from now, I might have some respiratory infection or disease. Who knows what we are breathing in and out.\u201d\n\nEven with the threat of fires, the 32-year-old said he\u2019d still prefer LA to any other region that gets colder than 50F (10C).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Naraji Moral stands on Hollywood Boulevard in LA\u2019s 90F (32C) heat. Photograph: Sam Levin/The Guardian\n\nA few miles away on Hollywood Boulevard by the Walk of Fame, Naraji Moral, 27, was sweating in the hot sun on a corner where she and other rappers perform for passersby.\n\n\u201cI feel like the government is fucking with our planet,\u201d she said, standing in 90F (32C) heat. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for fall. This is not fall.\u201d\n\nAisha Nyo, who works long days at an outdoor T-mobile kiosk on Hollywood Boulevard, gestured to her row of empty water bottles when asked how she was coping with the heat. Next to her, a man ran through a fountain in the plaza, soaking his clothes.\n\n\u201cCertain times you just can\u2019t breathe,\u201d Nyo said, adding, \u201cBut I see what\u2019s going on around the world and I try not to complain. It could be worse.\u201d", "description": "California\u2019s \u2018new normal\u2019 is a season of forced power shutdowns, mandatory evacuations and breathing problems", "authors": ["Sam Levin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/257d545abba3cfd4cdd4a910f9d0acf81d50f8fc/0_298_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=69631887e4f9befda5479ed13cb71599", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
