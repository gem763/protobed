Which young person can show the greatest arrogance toward those with decades of experience under their belts? Which intelligent person can best reduce a complicated topic to pabulum for the masses?\"\n\nShe sarcastically accused the candidates of enlisting the \"brilliant\" strategy of engaging the public \"by showing them the worst of who we are.\"\n\nThe wellness author and spiritual guru acknowledged that she wasn't on stage last night, and she pointed a finger at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for narrowing the field of candidates \"at the very moment when it should be opening up.\"\n\n\"Placing a political straitjacket on our primary system, controlling the process via money and ridiculous rules, the party is risking disaster,\" Williamson wrote, and that \"making sure [the debate contains] only its preordained category of people, discussing its preordained category of topics, [and] is placed before the American people for consideration as contenders for the nomination to run against President Trump -- has created a false, inauthentic piece of high school theater posing as the Democratic debates.\"\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON: 'THE SYSTEM IS EVEN MORE CORRUPT THAN I KNEW'\n\n\"This,\" she wrote,\"would all be funny if it weren\u2019t so dangerous.\"\n\n\"For reasons not easy to detect, the Democrats are held to a higher standard by the American people -- who, despite a bad rap and a few spectacular failures, are usually good at smelling a rat. Try as they might to throw people off the scent, the DNC and its media pals are creating the stench of inauthenticity at exactly the moment when some blazing truths should be shining through.\"\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON: I'M NOT SOME 'CRYSTAL WOO-WOO LADY' PEOPLE ON THE 'LEFT' SAY I AM\n\nWilliamson said political insiders are parading around a \"repackaged\" democratic process that she called a \"faux democracy.\"\n\nWhen she asked herself a question in the third person about whether or not it's time for her to drop out, Williamson wrote: \"After that debate Tuesday night, are you kidding?\"\n\n\"Let me get this right. You think a sanitized wish list of Democratic proposals, focused just enough on appealing to people\u2019s self-interest but not going anywhere near a serious discussion of what ails us, is going to defeat the Republicans? You think your 2016 redux, containing no hint of self-reflection on what created the disaster last time, is going to fight off the specter of neo-fascism? Well, I don't,\" she wrote.\n\n\"If our political gatekeepers keep locking the gate, then the people ourselves will unlock it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Democratic presidential hopeful Marianne\u00a0Williamson said \"everyone had a bad night\" at Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, and the candidates' lackluster performances in front of the American people\u00a0are\u00a0why she isn't dropping out of the race.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon", "Melissa Leon Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
