We will be revealing 20 players per day, starting with the players who ranked 100-81. 2/21 100. Yaya Toure A brilliant midfielder who had everything: skill, tenacity, power, goals, energy. His defensive capabilities brought him to the fore at Barcelona before his attacking prowess made him such a weapon for Manchester City. He won two Ligas, three Premier Leagues, one Champions League, captained Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations and was African Player of the Year four times. LO Getty Images 3/21 99. Harry Kane His raw statistics are simply phenomenal. 130 Premier League goals for Tottenham Hotspur, in just 186 appearances. 27 in 42 for England. Twice a Premier League Golden Boot winner. A World Cup Golden Boot winner. Tottenham\u2019s talisman. England\u2019s captain. And still just 26 years old. In 10 years\u2019 time, expect to see Kane in the top 20 of a similar list. LB Getty Images 4/21 98. Daniele De Rossi A ferociously competitive and combative midfield hard man, who made over 600 appearances for his beloved Roma and over 100 for his national team. A complete midfielder, who could in one passage of play win the ball, race forward and either release a team-mate with a pinpoint pass or score himself. And do not be fooled by his combustible reputation: in 2016, he placed his treasured World Cup winner's medal in the coffin of Pietro Lombardi, Italy\u2019s kit man at the tournament. LB AFP/Getty Images 5/21 97. Bastian Schweinsteiger The meticulous German orchestrated Bayern Munich's midfield to eight Bundesliga titles and a Champions League, making over 500 appearances for the club. He was also one of the leaders in Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning campaign and carried an aura in the centre of the pitch few players can claim to have replicated. TK Bongarts/Getty Images 6/21 96. Vincent Kompany It\u2019s difficult to define his importance to both Manchester City and Belgium but it\u2019s safe to say he was one of the most important players of a generation. There may well be a handful of technically better centre-backs but his intangibles were vital to the culture at club and country where there was not a legacy of winning previously. JR Getty Images 7/21 95. Karim Benzema One of the few strikers on this list who can truly claim to be the complete forward, able to play wide or central, deep linking play or on the shoulder of the last defender, with the ability to sniff out scrappy goals and score beauties too. His medal haul speaks for itself, and he is approaching 300 career goals. But for his strained relationship with the French national team, he would have scored even more. LO Getty Images 8/21 94. Sol Campbell The heartbeat of Arsenal's defence in the Invincibles season, a double-winner in 2002 and a mainstay of the England team for almost a decade, Campbell is one of the defining defensive figures of the Premier League era. TK AFP/Getty Images 9/21 93. Pepe One of the great villains of the game but a nasty, hard centre-back that would be very high on any great striker\u2019s list of defenders he least wanted to play against. While his grit and determination stand out, nobody lasts a decade at the Bernabeu without possessing exceptional quality, with three La Liga titles (which has eluded the club since his departure) and as many Champions Leagues, Zinedine Zidane would be wise to acquire a similar player now. JR Getty Images 10/21 92. Edwin van der Sar The four-time Premier League winner made over 300 appearances in England and made an enduring habit of thriving under pressure, winning the man-of-the-match award in Manchester United's Champions League final victory in 2008. TK Getty Images 11/21 91. Arturo Vidal Only the finest players in the world enjoy long and fruitful stints at clubs such as Juventus, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Il Guerriero has matured into a splendid holding midfielder, aggressive and dominant in the middle of the pitch but equally as effective arriving late into the box to complete attacks. A hero in his native Chile, for his role in the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica victory. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 12/21 90. Angel di Maria A key player in the glorious Real Madrid side that won La Liga in 2011/12 and the Champions League two seasons later. Widely considered a flop when he left Manchester United after only one miserable season, but the Argentine completely reinvented himself at Paris Saint-Germain, the starring attraction in one of the most expensive squads ever assembled, containing the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Edinson Cavani. LB AFP/Getty Images 13/21 89. Diego Forlan A figure of fun in his early Premier League days at Manchester United, Forlan went on to have the last laugh with a stellar career both internationally with Uruguay and in Spain, where he racked up goals for Villarreal and Atletico Madrid, twice winning the European Golden Shoe. LO AFP/Getty Images 14/21 88. Radamel Falcao In his pomp Falcao was probably the best striker on the planet. In a prolific four-year spell playing for Porto and Atletico Madrid he scored 142 goals in 178 games, and had injuries not hindered his career there is little doubt that Colombia's record scorer would be much higher up this list. LO Getty Images 15/21 87. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Has excelled in a thoroughly mediocre Arsenal side for two seasons now, scoring at a rate better than a goal every other game in a side that has struggled since the departure of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. But it is primarily for his achievements at Borussia Dortmund that he makes this list. He scored close to 150 Bundesliga goals for that wonderfully attacking team \u2013 including 31 in one season \u2013 winning the Bundesliga Player of the Year and Top Goalscorer awards. There have been few strikers as rapid or as decisive in front of goal in the last two decades. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 16/21 86. Robin Van Persie One of the best left foots in Premier League history graced two of its most revered clubs, becoming a star at both Arsenal and Manchester United. The Dutchman had a penchant for the spectacular but suffered with injuries, and it is a sign of what could have been that in the two Premier League seasons he played more than 30 games, he won the Golden Boot in both. LO Getty Images 17/21 85. Carlos Tevez A real pest of a striker who thrived in the hottest atmospheres and regularly overcame adversity. He scored plenty too, 116 league goals in eight seasons with United, City and Juventus (who probably all enjoyed prime Tevez), but it was the way he would trigger his teammates by forcing the first mistake or sparking counterattacks that really made him such an invaluable player. JR Getty Images 18/21 84. Gaizka Mendieta The midfield maestro could control games and decide them too, and was at the heart of the brilliant Valencia team which reached back-to-back Champions League finals in 2000 and 2001. He became one of the most expensive players of all time when he switched to Lazio, but he would never again reach the heights that made him a legend at the Mestalla. LO Getty Images 19/21 83. Virgil van Dijk The defensive talisman cast a spell of leadership over Liverpool's 2019 Champions League-winning side and went the entire campaign without being dribbled past. Few defenders have carried such an overarching influence on any side in recent memory. TK Getty Images 20/21 82. Hernan Crespo One of the finest finishers of a generation but perhaps his best quality was his movement; particularly in the box, where nobody was more lethal at finding a yard of space and punishing opponents. Strong and an aerial threat, he was perhaps unfortunate to follow Gabriel Batistuta with Argentina, otherwise he would have been appreciated even more. Certainly as talented as Sergio Aguero and with perhaps more composure in the biggest occasions - an underrated player. JR AFP/Getty Images 21/21 81. Rio Ferdinand A gem of a centre-back, who was perhaps ahead of his time, right now he would be even more valuable due to his versatility to thrive under any manager, no matter the philosophy or style of play. Became a real winner and leader at United and formed one of the greatest partnerships in international football history alongside John Terry with England - who should have obviously achieved much more with such an outstanding foundation to their team.

Became a real winner and leader at United and formed one of the greatest partnerships in international football history alongside John Terry with England - who should have obviously achieved much more with such an outstanding foundation to their team. JR Getty Images\n\nGennaro Gattuso\n\nBritish football never saw the best of Gennaro Gattuso. Signed by Rangers from Perugia in 1997, the teenager was initially prevented from playing in Scotland as the Italian FA refused to release his registration. When he did get on the pitch, he was frequently played out of position. He struggled with the language and, according to legend, once arrived at training to find that a certain Mr P Gascogine had defected in his socks.\n\nBut he soon got to grips with playing so far from home and, one season later, earned himself a move to AC Milan. That is where his career truly took off, and where he became one of the best players in the world. He would go on to make over 450 appearances as Milan\u2019s snarling heart: winning two Serie A titles and two Champions Leagues.\n\nIn 2006, he also played a starring role in Italy\u2019s World Cup triumph in Germany. Deep into extra-time in the final against France, as the game began to lurch wildly from one end of the pitch to the other, it was Gattuso who saved his beloved nation: twice haring back downfield to dispossess Florent Malouda and scupper French counter-attacks. Italy would not have won that World Cup without him.\n\nGattuso may not have been the most technically astute midfielder of the past twenty years, but he was one of the most passionate and vital: a born winner who dragged his teams through their most difficult moments, often by sheer force of will alone. He deserves a place in our list. Luke Brown\n\nJavier Mascherano\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain why Javier Mascherano doesn\u2019t feature in this list. Five La Liga titles, two Champions Leagues and a swamp of other baubles certainly feels like it passes the invisible threshold that separates success and greatness. He played with a rugged tactical nous that translated fluently from San Lorenzo to London, Liverpool and then into a finer art at Barcelona and his enduring leadership saw him become the highest-capped player in Argentina\u2019s history.\n\nPerhaps, then, it is because Mascherano was always one of the unsung cogs in a team. The man who filled the voids others didn\u2019t want to step into. Within Barcelona\u2019s beauty, he was the brash disruptor wading through with his hands covered in oil. The cynical foul to disrupt a counter-attack, the clattering tackle that others shied away from, the petulance and permanent whisper in the referee\u2019s ear.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s why he isn\u2019t necessarily remembered with such gleam, but even on of the greatest Barcelona teams relied on such a figure to prop up the canvas, and Mascherano was one of the best to play that villain over the past two decades. Tom Kershaw\n\nMaicon\n\nMaicon was the epitome of the traditional buccaneering Brazilian full-back and his peak might be as close to Cafu as we have seen. Dani Alves had the longevity, but Maicon in his prime was more destructive and lifted his teams by starting \u2013 and finishing \u2013 moves. It was less picking the lock and more smashing the door down when Maicon had picked up top speed.\n\nIntegral to Jose Mourinho\u2019s treble-winning Inter Milan, his goal in perhaps the greatest Champions League tie against Barcelona defined him. Lionel Messi was hurried off the ball down Barcelona\u2019s right, which acted as a trigger for Maicon, who swiftly stormed down the vacant corridor of space on the opposite side of the pitch. A perfectly-timed run into the box, collecting Diego Milito\u2019s cutback, combined with a calm finish perfectly illustrated how devastating Maicon could be. Jack Rathborn\n\nMesut Ozil\n\nIt would be easy to look at Mesut Ozil today, those sad eyes peering out under the hood of his rain jacket on the Arsenal bench, and forget what came before. It would be understandable if we\u2019d lost sight of the irrepressible Ozil of 2011-12, who made 19 goals as Real Madrid won La Liga with a record 100 points, flitting up the right wing and bending unethical throughballs with the outside of his left foot; or the player who buzzed at the heart of Germany\u2019s 2014 World Cup triumph; or the player who made 15+ assists in six different seasons in the Bundesliga, La Liga and the Premier League.\n\nHe still has those gifts \u2013 Philipp Lahm once said Ozil has the best vision of any player he\u2019s played with, and that vision will never fade \u2013 but perhaps football has moved on too quickly. If Ozil briefly felt like a player ahead of his time, he now seems like one from an age gone by. Someone like Wesley Sneijder, for example, had a similar magical touch without great mobility, but he got out before the Guardiola press and the Klopp counter-press consumed the game. Now 30, Ozil is left looking like a weak link rather than a secret weapon, but that fact should only strengthen our resolve not to blur the memory of one of the most relentlessly creative footballers of the 21st century. Lawrence Ostlere\n\nRicardo Carvalho\n\nRicardo Carvalho established himself as one of the most majestic centre-backs of his era, while also having the craft to bend the rules in his favour. The Portuguese thrived under Jose Mourinho, both at Porto, where he won the Champions League, and then at Chelsea, where he formed one of the finest partnerships of the decade alongside John Terry.\n\nCarvalho would pick up possession with a swagger, sweeping the ball to any target he desired, while also daring the opposition to offer him a channel of space that he would regularly penetrate with his regular forrays out from the back. A stint at Real Madrid yielded a La Liga title, while he was also part of the Portuguese side who won the European Championship in 2016.\n\nCarvalho\u2019s speciality was the interception; often lurking, ready to jump out from the back and pinch possession in midfield to join the subsequent counter-attack. While his slide tackling was usually exquisite; timed perfectly due to his useful pace and reliable reading of the game, Carvalho was truly outstanding.
