(Salvatore Romano/NurPhoto/Getty Images)\n\nThe Swiss tourist had planned the trip of a lifetime: taking LSD while on vacation at Disneyland Paris. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nPlenty, as the 32-year-old engineer discovered this past weekend. He wound up in jail on narcotics charges after disappearing into a pond and launching a 130-person search with helicopters and dogs, only to turn up hours later, naked and confused, on a quiet residential street about a mile away.\n\nThe misadventure began Friday evening, when the man\u2019s 30-year-old girlfriend slipped him the hallucinogenic drug, according to Le Parisien. Almost immediately, he fell into a man-made lake in Adventureland, near Captain Hook\u2019s Pirate Ship and the menacing grimace of Skull Rock from \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d\n\nWhen he didn\u2019t resurface, his girlfriend grew nervous. At around 8:30 p.m. Friday, the park began to close up for the night, and she alerted staff that he was still missing. The French newspaper didn\u2019t indicate whether the woman had also taken LSD but did note that she \u201cdid not seem to be in possession of all her means.\u201d (The couple have not been named in French media accounts, in accordance with European privacy laws.)\n\nFor hours, worried Disneyland employees combed the park, but there was no sign of the Swiss engineer. He hadn\u2019t climbed onto the pirate ship, or hopped on the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril ride, or hauled himself onto Pirates\u2019 Beach. The search party came to include 10 divers, 10 policemen, 30 firefighters and 80 Disneyland Paris employees, Le Parisien reported. By then, it had grown dark, making it harder for them to peer into the lagoon circling Adventureland, and dogs and a police helicopter with a thermal camera were brought in for backup.\n\nEarly the next morning, as the search continued, a 44-year-old man driving home from work came across an odd sight in the town of Chessy, a little more than a mile from Disneyland Paris.\n\n\u201cI came face to face with a naked man,\u201d the driver, who asked only to be identified as Benoit, told Le Parisien. \u201cHe was walking in the middle of the road. He did not have a centimeter of clothes on him and he was barefoot.\u201d\n\nThe man was calmly making his way down Chemin de Foss\u00e9s Rouges, a tranquil tree-lined street where cottages and large villas sit behind hedges and imposing gates. \u201cI stopped, got out of the car and went to meet him,\u201d Benoit told the paper. \u201cI wanted to know what a naked man was doing 300 meters from my home.\u201d\n\nThe nude man, who by then was completely dry, had scratches all over his arms and legs. \u201cHe didn\u2019t remember anything,\u201d Benoit said. Somewhat problematically, he also didn\u2019t speak French.\n\nEventually, the two realized they could communicate in English, and the mysterious naked man explained that he had taken LSD as part of a bet that he made with friends, and that his girlfriend was probably worried. Benoit offered to call her, but the man was also unable to remember the number.\n\nWith his initial apprehension dissipating, Benoit realized that the man was harmless and also horribly lost. He put the stranger in his car and ran inside his house to get a pair of rugby shorts and a T-shirt \u201cso that he could cover himself up,\u201d he told Le Parisien. Then, he dropped his baffled passenger off at the park\u2019s edge, having somehow gathered that the man\u2019s strange journey had begun at Disneyland Paris.\n\nRescuers found the man there at around 1:15 a.m., and he and his girlfriend were arrested for narcotics use, according to Le Parisien, and taken to the police station in Chessy.\n\nBut authorities evidently felt the couple had been through enough, because they were released Saturday afternoon after spending less than a day in jail. Le Parisien reported that both received a \u201crappel a la loi\u201d for drug use, which roughly translates to \u201creminder of the law.\u201d The citation, which doesn\u2019t get added to a person\u2019s official criminal record, is typically handed out when a prosecutor chooses not to press charges.\n\nDisneyland Paris, likewise, was unfazed by the incident. Park officials told Le Parisien that the hours-long search didn\u2019t disrupt their regular operations or a 5K race that took place the same evening. \u201cThe visitors did not even realize that there was a problem,\u201d a source told the paper.\n\nIt remains unclear how the man surfaced from the Adventureland lake and left the park without his girlfriend noticing, what happened to all his clothes, and where he went for several hours while rescuers were frantically searching for him.\n\nBut initial news reports about the disappearance at least solved one mystery for Benoit, who had been wondering about the chain of events that led a severely confused naked man to materialize in front of his car.\n\n\u201cIt was my wife who, seeing the article, explained to me what had happened!\u201d he told Le Parisien.", "description": "The Swiss tourist's girlfriend told park staff that he had fallen into a man-made lake.
