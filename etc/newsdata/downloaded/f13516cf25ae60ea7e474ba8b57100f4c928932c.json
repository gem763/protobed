Now that everyone sees it, they want me to conform to that same system that has failed me all those years. 'I'm not mad at anyone. I'm just asking for the freedom to prove them all wrong.' Release me @raiders.\"\n\nRead more: Antonio Brown asks for 'release' in Instagram post after Raiders reportedly void $30 million in guaranteed money\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Brown was fined $215,073.53 Friday evening for \"conduct detrimental to the team\" September 4. According to Schefter, the fine would void nearly $30 million owed to Brown in his contract.\n\nBrown reportedly wrote in an email, \"No way I play after they took that,\" according to ESPN's Jeff Darlington.\n\nBrown was a blockbuster acquistition for the Raiders during the offseason, with the team signing him to a three-year, $54 million deal after trading a third- and fifth-round pick to the Steelers to bring the superstar receiver to Oakland.\n\nBut instead of jump-starting the Raiders offense, Brown will end his time in Oakland without ever playing a snap for the Silver and Black.\n\nAgent Drew Rosenhaus told Ian Rapaport of the NFL Network that Brown is already looking towards the future and hoping to sign with a new team soon.\n\nIt's unclear what the market will be like for Brown after he seemed to cause nothing but frustration for the Oakland front office, but as one of the most undeniably talented receivers in the league, it's easy to understand why some teams would be willing to take a chance on him and hope that things go differently with a fresh start.", "description": "The Raiders tweeted Saturday that Antonio Brown had been released from the team following a bizarre Instagram post.", "authors": ["Benjamin Goggin", "Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d73ddb12e22af52cc419344-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
