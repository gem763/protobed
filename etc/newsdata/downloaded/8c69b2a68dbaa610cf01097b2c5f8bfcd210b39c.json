The results in your poll won\u2019t match the real-world opinion you\u2019re trying to measure \u2014 instead, the poll will be skewed by how willing some people are to respond to a survey.\n\nSome folks see potential for nonresponse to wreak havoc on nearly every poll, but actual evidence of nonresponse bias is hard to come by. There are known patterns in the way people respond to surveys \u2014 Americans with more education are more likely to take a poll, for example. But pollsters study these patterns and try to correct for them, which usually allows them to avoid error, though sometimes not.\n\nFor the most part, pollsters\u2019 adjustments do a pretty good job of accounting for nonresponse problems, especially in big national polls.\n\nThe exception, however, comes with the highest of high-profile news events. We have evidence of several brief episodes of nonresponse error, and all three came in the wake of big news stories near the conclusion of an election \u2014 in 2012, 2016 and 2018.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mark Blumenthal", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features How-A-Big-Enough-News-Story-Like-Impeachment-Could-Warp-The-Polls"], "top_image": ""}
