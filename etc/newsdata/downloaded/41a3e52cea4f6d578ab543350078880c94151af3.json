Alyssa Milano and Ted Cruz agree to discuss gun policy in person", "language": "en", "text": "Actress Alyssa Milano and Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz are going to meet in person to discuss gun policy in the United States after a tense back-and-forth on Twitter.\n\n\"I\u2019d love to come in and meet with you on the gun issue and many other issues that include life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, @tedcruz and also, 1 Peter 4:8. I\u2019ll be in DC next week,\" Milano, 46, said, referencing a Bible verse that suggests everyone \"love each other deeply.\" \"We can live-stream the meeting so the American people can hear your bullshit 1st hand,\" she also said.\n\nCruz, 48, replied positively to the challenge, gesturing that the meetup could be a healing moment for the country. \"I\u2019d be happy to sit down & visit next week about uniting to stop gun violence & about the Constitution,\" the senator tweeted. \"If we can have a civil & positive conversation\u2014in the spirit of 1 Peter 4:8 as you suggest\u2014despite our political differences, that might help resolve the discord in our Nation.\"\n\nI\u2019d be happy to sit down & visit next week about uniting to stop gun violence & about the Constitution.

It is of course not the right to a modern-day firearm that is God-give but rather the right to Life & the right to Liberty. Essential to that right to life is the right to DEFEND your life & your family,\" he tweeted to Milano.\n\nAn excellent Q, worth considering carefully w/o the snark of Twitter.
