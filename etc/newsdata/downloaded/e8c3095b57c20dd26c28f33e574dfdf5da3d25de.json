Yet such episodes have a profound effect on what is regarded as acceptable or even normal.\n\nThe trashing of institutions, and the existing order, are seen as almost accidental fallout when in fact they lie at the heart of what these political outsiders pursue. And it is a trashing without any coherent order or philosophy behind it, or even any links to the traditional positions of the political parties these leaders purport to represent.\n\nAustralia not immune\n\nIn Australia we have our own version of this phenomenon of relentlessness and incremental shifting of the goal posts, most notably in the way leadership challenges play out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a seemingly relentless deterioration in our politicians\u2019 belief in the need to be accountable seems to have only accelerated as more and more voters switch off from politics.\n\nEnergy Minister Angus Taylor has always been regarded as an MP to watch. Smart. A powerful advocate. Not exactly lacking in self-belief.\n\nMinister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor has had a very bad week. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nBut we now seem to be watching him, all the time, for all the wrong reasons.\n\nTaylor came under intense pressure over The Guardian\u2019s story about his attack on City of Sydney mayor Clover Moore.\n\nThe minister wrote a very political letter to Moore after she had written to the federal government criticising its climate policy.\n\n\u201cYou might be interested to know that there are many practical ways local councils can take real and meaningful action to reduce their carbon emissions,\" he parried.\n\n\u201cOne way is to limit unnecessary air travel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe crucial bits of this story relate to what came next. Taylor claimed in the letter that the council\u2019s annual report showed an astronomical $15 million travel budget in just one year.\n\nHis letter was then leaked to The Daily Telegraph even before it had been received by Moore.\n\nFinally, Taylor obstinately refused to explain what had happened, or even apologise if it was a mistake that he had accidentally got the numbers wrong. He went even further, attacking Moore for perpetrating a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d.\n\nHe insisted the figures had come straight from the council\u2019s website, even though documents that subsequently emerged clearly suggest that someone had doctored documents sent to The Daily Telegraph by the minister\u2019s office in support of his claims in the letter.\n\nWhen challenged repeatedly about this latest controversy on Thursday, he rather bizarrely said he didn\u2019t \u201caccept the premise\u201d of the question.\n\nThere is no evidence that Taylor himself doctored the document.\n\n'Cavalier disregard' for accountability\n\nBut Labor is pointing out that the use of such forged documents raises questions about a possible breach of the criminal law in NSW.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was not until late on Friday that Taylor accepted that the numbers were wrong and apologised, though he pointed out that there were different versions of the document on the City of Sydney's website and only the council could prove which documents had existed. He continued to deny any forgery was involved.\n\nThe point of all this isn\u2019t just about who did what and when, but about the utter contempt Taylor has shown for any accountability for his actions.\n\nIt was not until much later that there was even the slightest suggestion of concern that he may have falsely accused a public figure, using incorrect information, or that he might investigate how that had happened.\n\nAnd there were no public signals from the Prime Minister that he would pursue the matter with his minister.\n\nScott Morrison has a history of a cavalier lack of regard for accountability, variously dismissing questions about policy areas for which he is responsible as \"on water matters\", as things only of interest to the \"Canberra bubble\" or \"rumours\". They are positions only marginally different from Trump\u2019s \"fake news'.\n\nLabor is pointing to similarities with the Utegate episode in 2009, when Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s leadership of the opposition became terminal after he seized on what turned out to be forged emails concerning then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.\n\nThe comparison highlights how the goal posts of accountability have moved even just in the past 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in an another, almost eerie parallel with an earlier political scandal \u2013 the so-called \"whiteboard\" or \"sports rorts\" affair that cost Labor minister Ros Kelly her job \u2013 it emerged late on Thursday that hundreds of applications for sports facilities were recommended for funding by Sport Australia but rejected by then-sports minister Bridget McKenzie in the lead-up to this year\u2019s election.\n\nMcKenzie used her ministerial power to choose the clubs and councils she felt deserved a slice of more than $100 million in funding, including more than $25 million for her home state.\n\nSenator McKenzie, the deputy Nationals leader and now Agriculture Minister, was approached by ABC reporter Jack Snape for comment.\n\nHer office said they were not in a position to comment because they did not keep records, and directed the ABC to the new Sport Minister, Richard Colbeck.\n\nPart of the new cavalier approach to accountability must be based on the view that the public isn\u2019t watching, and isn\u2019t interested, a self-perpetuating position thanks to the depressing spectre of politics.\n\nThe media, or at least parts of it, might be watching. But that apparently holds no concerns for the government either, as Scott Morrison made clear in his response to the media \"right to know\" campaign earlier this week.\n\nIt may be depressing. But no one can afford to look away.", "description": "The trashing of norms and rules without accountability might be the mark of Trump and Brexit, but it is playing out here as well.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/064976a7ee2e30e8d7e3df74a1327e75d91b2fd3", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
