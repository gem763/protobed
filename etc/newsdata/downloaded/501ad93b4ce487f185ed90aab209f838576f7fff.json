Stock futures and global equities are deep in the red for Wednesday.\n\nExpect lots of attention to fall on private-sector payroll data later ahead of Friday\u2019s bigger jobs data. Some may be looking further out to U.S.- China trade talks and a Federal Reserve decision later this month \u2014 bets on a rate cut are growing \u2014 to cheer up stocks.\n\nAs stocks fell Tuesday, investors seeking a haven from economic concerns flocked to bonds, which drove yields down and prices higher. Our call of the day, from the president of Bianco Research, James Bianco says investors shouldn\u2019t wish for higher yields \u2014a potential disaster for stocks.\n\nThe 30-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.05% is yielding around 2.19%, making it the only interest rate left among G-20 developed countries above 2%, he says.\n\n\u201cThat is a high yield, that\u2019s what you dream for,\u201d Bianco tells MarketWatch in an interview. \u201cThe 30-year bond is up 22% this year, it\u2019s well ahead of the S&P. Especially if you look at negative yields in Europe, this has been one of the best years in history to own fixed-income securities, especially investment grade from a return perspective.\u201d\n\nBianco is convinced rates could go ever lower for several reasons, such as the absence of inflation as Amazon AMZN, -0.01% and others in that retail space drive down prices of goods, central banks push interest rates further into negative territory and the global economy slows.\n\nBut he thinks lots of investors haven\u2019t come to grips with that notion. \u201cA lot of people still think that safe, risk-free investment should still yield them 4% or 5%. \u201cBut your reward for getting a 4% or 5% yield again is going to probably be a 30% or 50% decline in the stock market.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the world can handle high rates anymore,\u201d Bianco said, recalling how a year ago, the yield on the U.S. 10-year bond TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.21% hit 3.25%, and the S&P 500 fell nearly 20%. When the Fed backed off interest rates and promised to be patient in early January, the market rebounded.\n\n\u201cWhat we showed was we went to 3.25% for a couple of weeks and the U.S. stock market broke,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way we can get to 4% or 5%, without this creating a lot of damage.\u201d\n\nRead: Here\u2019s how the rest of the year goes after an ugly October start for stocks\n\nThe market\n\nDow YM00, -0.47%, S&P ES00, -0.47% and Nasdaq NQ00, -0.57% futures are down by more than 0.5% each. Oil CLX19, +0.41% and gold GCZ19, +0.36% are flat and the dollar DXY, +0.10% is up.\n\nEuropean stocks SXXP, -1.52% are tanking, while Asian equities ADOW, -0.84% also pulled back. Korea\u2019s KOSPI 180721, -1.95% slid 1.5% after North Korean fired a missile into the sea.\n\nThe chart\n\nOne reason to worry about the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Index that dropped to a more-than-decade low in September? Close correlation with year-over-year growth of the S&P 500, notes Robeco portfolio manager Jeroen Blokland in a post.\n\nWhile these two have diverged in the past, he said the S&P would need to fall by 13% to reach where the ISM currently sits.\n\nThe buzz\n\nFacebook FB, -1.27% is reportedly struggling to keep its cryptocurrency-based payments network, Libra, on track after backers such as Visa V, +1.33% and Mastercard MA, -0.23% appear to be getting cold feet.\n\nReal estate group Lennar LEN, -0.23% and retailer Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY, -3.01% will report results.\n\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.47% has settled two Ohio opioid lawsuits for $20 million, to avoid the first federal trial over the crisis. The company said the deal was not an admission of liability .\n\nADP employment is due out ahead of the market open. New York and Philadelphia Fed Presidents John Williams and Patrick Harker will each make appearances.\n\nThe stat\n\n$3.5 million \u2014 That\u2019s how much a Houston businessman has bet on the Astros winning Major League Baseball World Series. And he\u2019s got a lot to lose.\n\nRandom reads\n\nHurricane Lorenzo lashes small Portugal islands, heads toward Ireland, U.K.\n\nInvoking the memory of his mother, Prince Harry backs wife\u2019s lawsuit of British tabloid\n\nNew poll points to CNN, Fox News as most polarizing brands in the U.S.\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
