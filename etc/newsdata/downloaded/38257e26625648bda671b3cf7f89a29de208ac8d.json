USA TODAY\n\nShocking disappointments and better-than-expected performances are anticipated each weekend in the wild world of college football. Even if everyone knows they are coming, guessing when and where they will happen is difficult.\n\nThe USA TODAY Sports college football staff \u2014 Jace Evans, Paul Myerberg, George Schroeder, Erick Smith, Eddie Timanus and Dan Wolken \u2014 weigh in with some bold predictions for Week 7 of the college football season:\n\nJace Evans\n\nOklahoma is going to blow out Texas in the Red River Rivalry. Neither team has won by more than 16 points in this game since OU hammered the Longhorns in both 2011 (55-17 win) and 2012 (63-21 win). But that could change Saturday as a Texas defense that sits 126th in FBS in passing yards allowed per game goes up against the high-flying Sooners, piloted this year by top Heisman Trophy contender Jalen Hurts. Add in that this is the most competent Oklahoma has looked on defense in years \u2013 against admittedly not the strongest competition out there \u2013 it could be a long day for the Longhorns if Sam Ehlinger is not able to go score-for-score with Hurts and Co.\n\nOklahoma running back Trey Sermon avoids a tackle against Texas during their 2018 game at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.

And what is that statement? That the Nittany Lions are ready for a tough rest of October \u2013 Michigan and Michigan State come next \u2013 and ready to give Ohio State a challenge in Columbus in November. Through five games, Penn State has scored 235 points and allowed just 37 and has outscored its two Big Ten opponents 94-7.\n\nIMPACT GAMES: Five Week 7 matchups that will influence the playoff\n\nSTAFF PICKS: LSU-Florida, Oklahoma-Texas highlight weekend\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nGeorge Schroeder\n\nJalen Hurts took some flak this week for seemingly downplaying the magnitude of the Red River rivalry. In reality, he was simply noting that he is familiar with pressure-packed moments (see the Iron Bowl, as he noted, or SEC and national championship games, too).\n\nThe atmosphere in the Cotton Bowl for Oklahoma-Texas is unique and unmatched. The intensity is jacked regardless of external stakes \u2013 and this time around, those are huge. But Hurts\u2019 premise was correct: Pressure? The senior graduate transfer has been there, done that. On Saturday, he\u2019ll deliver another superlative performance for his new team, propelling the Sooners to victory.\n\nErick Smith\n\nWisconsin has easily dispatched one talented team from the state of Michigan. Now comes a different test into Madison. Michigan State won't be confused with an offensive powerhouse, but the Spartans can do the one thing that will frustrate the Badgers: Stop the run.\n\nExpect a traditional Big Ten slugfest with lots of punts and the quarterbacks pressed into making plays. Jack Coan hasn't had to carry the Wisconsin offense this season, but he'll need to deliver in tight windows. Brian Lewerke of the Spartans has the edge in experience. He needs to be more consistent.\n\nThis one goes four quarters before the Badgers survive. Don't be surprised if Michigan State can pull the upset, though.\n\nEddie Timanus\n\nClemson will look like Clemson again.\n\nThe Tigers\u2019 most recent outing, a one-point escape from North Carolina two weeks ago, convinced a lot of poll voters that they shouldn\u2019t be the No. 1 team. It might have also prompted some to wonder if Florida State, which was showing signs of improvement after struggling early, might actually be able to challenge Clemson this week.\n\nIn a word, no.\n\nThe Tigers have heard all the speculation and criticism for the last two weeks. Trevor Lawrence hasn\u2019t been sharp, the offense isn\u2019t putting up big points like those other top-five teams, etc. Well, this time they will. There will be at least one long scoring pass and one big run broken off by Travis Etienne before the first quarter is over.\n\nMeanwhile, the Clemson defense is still nasty. The Seminoles have issues along the offensive line, which has given up 19 sacks and 48 tackles for loss through five games. James Blackman will be back at quarterback, but it won\u2019t matter since his friends can\u2019t protect him. Clemson wins this one, and wins it big.\n\nDan Wolken\n\nThis game is way off the radar but I think Arkansas will get Chad Morris\u2019 first SEC win at Kentucky\u2019s expense on Saturday. The Wildcats haven\u2019t been good at all on offense since their meltdown against Florida, which of course encompasses quarterback Terry Wilson getting hurt. With Sawyer Smith starting, Kentucky scored just 13 against Mississippi State and 7 against South Carolina, neither of which are very impressive defensively. Smith completed just 26-of-73 passes in those two games, which just isn\u2019t good at all. Arkansas showed some signs of life in a close loss to Texas A&M and may be smelling opportunity coming off a bye week.", "description": "Expect the unexpected in college football each weekend.
