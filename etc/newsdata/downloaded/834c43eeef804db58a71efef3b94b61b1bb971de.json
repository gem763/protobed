(Yahoo News Singapore file photo)\n\nSINGAPORE \u2014 A man who was released from the Reformative Training Centre went on to cut the prison tag attached to his ankle and then molested a teen inside a lift at a HDB block.\n\nAt the State Courts on Thursday (24 October), the perpetrator Irfan Ridhwan Irwan, 20, pleaded guilty to three charges - mischief, failing to comply with a legal order from a public servant, and using criminal force to outrage the modesty of a person.\n\nHe is expected to be sentenced next month, pending an assessment of his suitability for a second stint of reformative training.\n\nOn 20 July, the Singapore Prison Service\u2019s command control centre was alerted that Irfan had cut his prison tag. He had been released from RTC on a supervision scheme, under which he was to remain at home between 8pm and 8am daily.\n\nIrfan threw the prison tag which cost $341. No restitution has been made to date.\n\nThe next day, he saw an 18-year-old walking home and tailed her into the lift of her HDB block. The teen was running errands with her mother and heading home.\n\nThe victim was walking slowly while using her handphone and her mother walked back home first ahead of her.\n\nIrfan saw the victim walking alone from a distance as he was crossing an overhead bridge near Jalan Bukit Merah. He tailed her into the lift at her block and stood behind her.\n\nAs the lift went up, he suddenly hugged her from behind and said \u201cshh\u201d, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Joshua Foo.\n\nIrfan then touched the victim\u2019s right breast with his left hand and her stomach area with his right hand.\n\nThe victim immediately turned around and pushed Irfan away. She also told him \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d. He tried to get closer to her but she moved further away from him.\n\nWhen the lift doors opened on another floor, Irfan left and took the stairs before fleeing.\n\nThe victim continued to take the lift up to her floor and went home crying. Her father tried to look for the perpetrator to no avail before calling the police.\n\nIrfan was tracked down and arrested a few days later.\n\nOn 20 July, the prison service had also issued a recall order to Irfan, instructing him to report to the Llyod Leas Community Supervision Centre at 1 Cosford Road in Changi on 22 July, between 9am and 1pm.\n\nBut he failed to present himself.\n\nThe maximum punishment for molestation is up to two years\u2019 jail, along with a fine and caning.\n\nThe maximum penalty for mischief is up to one year in jail and a fine.\n\nFor failing to respond to the prison recall order, Irfan can be jailed for up to one month and fined up to $1,500.\n\nReformative training is a rehabilitative sentencing option for offenders under 21 who are found to be unsuitable for probation. Inmates under the programme undergo a strict regime and can be detained for up to three years. Unlike probation, reformative training results in a criminal record.\n\nOther Singapore stories:\n\nMan fined for masturbating and urinating in female residents' shoes\n\n1.4M Singaporeans to receive Bicentennial Bonus\n\nLotte Duty Free awarded deal to run liquor and tobacco stores in Changi Airport, launch in June 2020\n\nFruitful stint for Garie Tang, who earned scholarship to train at UFC performance institute in Shanghai\n\nExtended operating hours for SMRT trains, buses on Deepavali eve", "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 A man who was released from the Reformative Training Centre went on to cut the prison tag attached to his ankle and then molested a teen inside a lift at a HDB block.", "authors": ["Amir Hussain", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4g4lEC0P3QjMcWfYXMw4sg--~B/aD05MzQ7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-06/9e4a2480-9650-11e9-b7dd-f525c748081c", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
