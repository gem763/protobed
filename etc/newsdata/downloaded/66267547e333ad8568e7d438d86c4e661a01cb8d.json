It was then that County Commissioner Warren Hurst leaned toward the microphone and began a diatribe so hateful it caused Thompson to storm out of the meeting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLook what we got running for president in the Democratic Party. We can go over here to [the county jail] and get better people out of there than those running for Democratic, to be president of the United States,\u201d Hurst said, according to CBS affiliate WVLT, which captured some of his comments on video. \u201cWe got a queer running for president, if that ain\u2019t about as ugly as you can get.\u201d\n\nHis comment \u2014 an apparent reference to Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay \u2014 drew laughter and applause from many in the room, Thompson said. Hurst then decried the plight of white men in the United States.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced, but by golly, a white male in this country has very few rights, and they\u2019re getting took more every day,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear \u2019em stand on the stage and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m for the poor and the black.\u2019 You never heard one of them say \u2018I believe white people have rights, too.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThompson\u2019s exit was captured on video, too. The woman recalled standing up during Hurst\u2019s remarks to comment on his lack of professionalism. But no one was supporting her sentiment, she said, so she left.\n\n\u201cI found it totally unprofessional, demeaning, bullying; I could not stay there any longer,\u201d she said. \u201cThink about how many people were in that room. I\u2019m the only one who stood up and objected to it.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats in Sevier County keep their political affiliation private out of fear, Thompson said. But as Hurst\u2019s rant has drawn national attention, leaders in Sevier and its surrounding jurisdictions have insisted that the commissioner\u2019s views do not align with those of other officials in local government.\n\nAD\n\nHurst\u2019s statements \u201cdo not reflect the opinion or position of Sevier county administration,\u201d according to the Sevier County Twitter account. The city of Sevierville, the county\u2019s seat, was more explicit in its condemnation, writing that its administration rejects \u201cbigotry and prejudice toward any and all persons.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn his own statement, Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said he disapproved of Hurst\u2019s comments, which were \u201chis and his alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have lived in Sevier County my whole life and know it as a place that is welcoming to everyone, as evidenced by the more than 12 million people who visit annually,\u201d Waters said in a statement. \u201cGenerations of families have enjoyed our beautiful county and know that our citizens are caring and compassionate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSevier County\u2019s nearly 100,000 residents are more than 95 percent white, according to census data, and that racial majority is reflected in its leadership. Assistant Mayor Perrin Anderson told The Washington Post that the county\u2019s 25 commissioners are all white. The commission consists of 24 men and one woman. The primary focus of Monday\u2019s monthly meeting was the resolution to make Sevier a Second Amendment sanctuary \u2014 which means legislators will refuse to enforce laws they believe will infringe on the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. It passed in a unanimous vote.\n\nAD\n\nAnderson stressed that Hurst\u2019s comments were not related to anything on the meeting agenda. Hurst, who was elected as chairman of the commission in 1982, could not be reached for comment Tuesday but told WVLT he stands by his words. He also said some of his best friends were African American.\n\nState Rep. Gloria Johnson (D), whose Knox County district is 30 miles west of Sevier County, said Hurst should resign from the commission. Johnson underscored the importance of tourism in Sevier, which lies near the popular Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The county also contains the mountain towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, both known for their tourist attractions.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson lamented the dozens of social media posts she\u2019s seen from tourists to the area, some of whom have vowed not to return as long as Hurst remains on the commission.\n\nAD\n\nPigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster in a statement to WVLT said her city \u201cin no way condone[s] Sevier County Commissioner Hurst\u2019s disturbing comments\u201d and \u201cwelcomes everyone with open arms. We do not discriminate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating because they rely a lot on tourists. It\u2019s such a welcoming, wonderful place,\u201d Johnson said in an interview. \u201cBut then you\u2019ve got those elected officials there that are making statements like that, and the reality is, they represent everyone in the county \u2014 including the LGBTQ community. To lash out at their constituents like that is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJohnson called Hurst \u201cwrong and ignorant\u201d and said she was perturbed to see others laughing and clapping when he spoke.\n\n\u201cThat should not be who we are; it\u2019s frightening,\u201d she added. \u201cSomeone said \u2018Amen\u2019 as if he was preaching a sermon. It\u2019s all unacceptable, and we\u2019ve got to do better.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, which advocates for LGBTQ rights in the state, echoed Johnson\u2019s call for Hurst to resign. The other option, he said, would be for the commission to introduce inclusive ordinances for Sevier County to bolster protections against discrimination on the basis of race, gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere may be ways for him to make up for what he said, but they have to be concrete. We\u2019re beyond an apology at this point,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe need to see some real change backed up by public policy in that county.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cWe got a queer running for president, if that ain\u2019t about as ugly as you can get,\u201d said Warren Hurst, a Tennessee county commissioner.", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/74USKUEGXFxz0z1xzGb7vJjaEjw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HCMXHJXLZZGQTJUJSN7N3NEPYA.PNG", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
