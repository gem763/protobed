Lowe\u2019s last year said it would invest $500 million annually in technology through 2021, hiring as many as 2,000 software engineers, infrastructure engineers and data analysts to beef up its tech workforce of about 4,800. A spokeswoman said Wednesday that \u201cexecutives have shared that we have historically underinvested in talent and technology,\u201d without giving details.\n\nLowe\u2019s earlier this year bought a retail-analytics platform from Boomerang Commerce in a move that will help automate price changes of products across multiple sales platforms.\n\nIn August, Lowe\u2019s Chief Executive Marvin Ellison announced plans to complete moving the Lowe\u2019s website to the cloud in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think technology has had as much seat at the table as it has now, which is really front and center,\u201d said Ms. Godbole, who joined Lowe\u2019s from Target Corp. in November.\n\nLowe\u2019s expects 80% of its application portfolio to be built internally by 2021. Applications for common tasks like payroll processing will be purchased off the shelf.\n\nMore companies\u2014particularly in retail\u2014are hiring data scientists, business analysts and domain experts to take advantage of nuanced data integral to the business, said Mark Driver, a research vice president at Gartner Inc.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an age where people have their clothes custom fit. The same thing goes with software; it\u2019s about gaining that advantage,\u201d Mr. Driver said.\n\nMuch of Ms. Godbole\u2019s effort has been directed at Lowe\u2019s e-commerce platform. Over the past nine months, the company has deployed custom e-commerce features related to inventory, pricing and reviews.\n\n\u201cIf 100% of e-commerce is going to be brought in house, I would say we are absolutely 40% of the way,\u201d Ms. Godbole said. She expects the in-house version of key features such as online checkout to be deployed by the middle of next year.\n\nThe company is now developing and evaluating personalization features, where the online experience is geared around the type of shopper. Professional customers typically know what they want, and their product description page might include items they buy regularly. A do-it-yourself buyer will get a different experience with more details on features, functionality, and price comparisons as well as videos. The company will use internally developed machine-learning algorithms to personalize experiences, the Lowe\u2019s spokeswoman said.\n\nThe nature of personalization for a home-improvement chain is different than on a site like Amazon.com Inc. as there is a connection between in-store and online shopping experiences, said Jeriad Zoghby, global lead of digital marketplace services at Accenture Interactive, the marketing unit of Accenture PLC.\n\nA bathroom installation project could involve an in-store visit plus value-added services like installation, which calls for a different technology platform.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that\u2019s where [Ms. Godbole is] headed, she\u2019s realizing that they have to truly own the experience\u2014and to really create a more cohesive experience, one that\u2019s fully orchestrated,\u201d Mr. Zoghby said.\n\nLowe\u2019s effort to personalize online shopping comes as the company tweaks its operations. In August, the company cut jobs as it outsourced tasks such as assembling barbecue grills and janitorial services.\n\nIn recent years, the retailer\u2019s sales growth has lagged behind rival Home Depot Inc. In the latest quarter, Lowe\u2019s profit grew 10% to $1.68 billion, helped by a 7.7% drop in expenses.\n\nWrite to Agam Shah at agam.shah@wsj.com", "description": "Lowe\u2019s is taking more of a do-it-yourself approach to software development, retooling its e-commerce platform to boost sales.", "authors": ["Agam Shah", "Agam.Shah Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-110970/social", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
