Messi helped fire Barcelona to the 2018-19 league title and a staggering 54 goals in 58 games no doubt helped swing the vote in his favour.\n\nLeeds United and Marcelo Bielsa win Fifa fair play award for Aston Villa game Read more\n\nOn presenting the award, the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, condemned the latest incident of racism in Italy. \u201cWe have to say no to racism in any form. No to racism in society and no to racism in football,\u201d he said.\n\nAlisson collected the men\u2019s goalkeeper of the year award and was named in the Best men\u2019s XI, while J\u00fcrgen Klopp collected The Best men\u2019s coach award, beating Mauricio Pochettino and Pep Guardiola.\n\nOn accepting his award the German announced he has joined the Common Goal campaign launched by Juan Mata, where stars donate 1% of their wages to sporting charities. \u201cI don\u2019t 100% understand individual prizes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate, we\u2019ve had a very fortunate past and present and hopefully we will have a very fortunate future. But there are people out there that aren\u2019t in the same place and that is why tonight I want to announce that I\u2019ve joined the Common Goal campaign.\u201d\n\nQuick guide The Best: Fifa award winners Show Hide Men's player: Lionel Messi (Barcelona and Argentina)\n\nWomen's player: Megan Rapinoe (Reign FC and USA)\n\nMen's coach: J\u00fcrgen Klopp (Liverpool)\n\nWomen's coach - Jill Ellis (USA)\n\nMen's goalkeeper: Alisson Becker (Liverpool and Brazil)\n\nWomen's GK: Sari Van Veenendaal (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid/Netherlands)\n\nPuskas award for best goal - Daniel Zsori (Debrecen v Ferencvaros)\n\nFan award - Silvia Grecco (Palmeiras)\n\nFair play award - Marcelo Bielsa and Leeds United\n\nFIFPro men's world XI - Alisson; Matthijs De Ligt, Marcelo, Sergio Ramos, Virgil Van Dijk; Frenkie De Jong, Eden Hazard, Luka Modric; Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Lionel Messi.\n\nFIFPro women's world XI - Van Veenendaal; Lucy Bronze, Nilla Fischer, Kelley O'Hara, Wendie Renard; Julie Ertz, Amandine Henry, Rose Lavelle; Marta, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe.\n\nOf Van Dijk he said: \u201cIt\u2019s really nice that Virgil has got his reward now.

That\u2019s already crazy and I\u2019m really happy for him and the other boys.\u201d\n\nRapinoe, who stole the show on and off the pitch at the World Cup, finishing with the golden ball, golden boot and World Cup trophy, while using her platform to challenge Donald Trump and push Fifa on investment, was, for once, \u201ca little at a loss for words\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat very rarely happens to me, she said before thanking her teammates \u201cwho let me be a little bit wild at times but reel me in when needed\u201d. She then, characteristically, used her platform as a call to arms.\n\n\u201cStories that have inspired me most; Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly, the young Iran woman who burnt to death, the one out MLS player, the out NWSL players,\u201d she said.\n\nThe stars come out for the 2019 Fifa football awards in Milan \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\n\u201cIf we really want to have meaningful change everyone needs to be outraged.

I know Kelly Smith has been to these kind of events before and in the future we\u2019re going to have more and more England players, I hope so anyway.\u201d\n\nThe England manager, Phil Neville, agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cJill Scott, Steph Houghton, Ellen White, they deserve to be at awards of this type after a fantastic World Cup and we\u2019ve got players at the top of the game.\u201d\n\nOn her manager\u2019s belief that she should lift the trophy, Bronze said: \u201cI can imagine. I know what he\u2019s like, I\u2019m happy to be here and I\u2019m happy to be in the top three after such an up-and-down season. A good season with Lyon, we won a lot, and then the World Cup was heartbreaking but I think that\u2019s why the other two had more of a chance.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nJill Ellis collected the women\u2019s coach of the year award following her second successive World Cup-winning campaign with the US women\u2019s national team. The 53-year-old has announced she is stepping aside to take an ambassador role with US Soccer and Neville was full of praise for his semi-final opponent: \u201cWhen you win a World Cup, I think you should win the top award and I\u2019m glad everyone has voted for her like I did.\u201d\n\nEllis said, on collecting her award: \u201cWhat a ride. I want to thank Phil Neville and Sarina Wiegman for making my job hard. The World Cup really was a showcase. I think the world fell in love with our game.\u201d\n\nThe former Arsenal goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal, who joined the Spanish champions, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, after her World Cup heroics for the Netherlands, collected the inaugural women\u2019s goalkeeper of the year award.", "description": "Lionel Messi, Megan Rapinoe, J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Jill Ellis were the main winners at Fifa\u2019s The Best awards", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe9d8dfb7be197886072fe99130937a1a5828ee/9_0_2542_1525/master/2542.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8656fb2b8161a9355ab5dfd367d15e0c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
