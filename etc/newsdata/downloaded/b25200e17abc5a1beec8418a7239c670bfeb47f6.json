He owns the Fleece Inn, near Worcestershire, so he organized \"Nigel Night\" at the pub.\n\n\"We're going to die out soon, so it's important to sort of celebrate our Nigel-ness before we all pop off the planet.\"\n\nSmith says 434 Nigels \u2014 including himself \u2014 joined in the festivities on Saturday to enjoy some music, food and celebrating their mutual \"Nigel-ness.\"\n\nIt's believed to be the biggest gathering of Nigels in the world \u2014 though it's unclear who's keeping track of this unusual statistic.\n\nNigel Smith, owner of the Fleece Inn and organizer of Nigel Night. (@TheFleeceInn/Twitter)\n\nAll attending Nigels, ranging in age from seven months to 80 years old, were verified with an ID check, and handed a badge with their name on it. Other attendees were issued badges that read \"Not Nigel\" on them.\n\nAccording to the U.K. Office for National Statistics, no boys born in 2016 were named Nigel. The name enjoyed a slight uptick with 11 new Nigels in 2017, and eight in 2018.\n\nThat number pales in comparison to the most popular name, Oliver, which saw 5,390 new additions in 2018. Other top boys' names over the last decade included George, Harry, Noah and Jack.\n\nCongratulations Nigel Smith landlord of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheFleeceInn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TheFleeceInn</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bretforton?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Bretforton</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Worcestershire?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Worcestershire</a> for organising the record breaking gathering of Nigels at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NigelNight?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NigelNight</a> this evening. People came from all over the UK and as far as Australia! <a href=\"https://t.co/M6JvTqg7uF\">pic.twitter.com/M6JvTqg7uF</a> \u2014@HuddlestonNigel\n\nSmith said no women named Nigella attended the event. But he hopes to hold another gathering next year, and says Nigellas will be featured guests alongside the Nigels.\n\nHe admitted to hoping celebrity chef Nigella Lawson would have expressed interest in his event, but no such luck \u2014 this time, anyway.\n\n\"The whole thing was a ruse to get her here,\" he quipped.\n\n'A name you need to grow into'\n\nWhile the event attracted Nigels from all across the U.K. and beyond, Smith speculated that most of the attendees who shared the name are \"pretty stoical about life,\" partly because they were likely teased as children for their name.\n\n\"Nigel's a name you need to grow into, I think,\" he said.\n\nBut he offered that they often have \"quiet leadership skills,\" and cited numerous famous Nigels, such as boxer Nigel Benn, Formula One driver Nigel Mansell and actor Nigel Planer.\n\nNigel-themed beers were on tap during Nigel Night. (Submitted by Nigel Smith)\n\nFarage a no-show\n\nAmong the visiting Nigels was local MP Nigel Huddleston. But Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party and arguably one of the most well-known Nigels, didn't show.\n\nIt's unclear whether Farage was aware of Nigel Night; Smith speculated that his absence may have been for the best.\n\n\"He's obviously a very divisive political figure and I think one of the things that made our Nigel Night work so well was that it was not about the politics,\" he said.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage was not among the attendees at Nigel Night. (Vincent Kessler/Reuters)\n\nSmith didn't rule out the possibility that Farage's role in the 2016 Brexit referendum may have even played a part in the dearth of newborn Nigels that year.\n\n\"Despite the man, we are fighting back.\"\n\nWritten by Jonathan Ore.
