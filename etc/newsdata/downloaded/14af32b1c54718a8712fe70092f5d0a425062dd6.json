He is executive director at the Center for Thoracic Oncology in the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai, in New York City. \u201cThere needs to be much more substantial data.\u201d\n\nAnd animal research doesn\u2019t always pan out in humans.\n\nFor the study, Tang and his colleagues exposed 45 laboratory mice to nicotine-containing vapor four hours a day for five days a week, over a period of 54 weeks.\n\nA second group of 20 mice were exposed to e-cigarette vapor that did not contain nicotine, and a third group of 20 mice were exposed only to the filtered air of the laboratory.\n\nBy the end, about 23 percent of mice breathing nicotine-laced vapor developed lung tumors, compared with only about 6 percent of mice breathing filtered air. None of the mice breathing simple vapor developed tumors.\n\nAdditionally, 58 percent of mice breathing nicotine-laced vapor developed bladder urothelial hyperplasia \u2014 lesions in the bladder that frequently turn cancerous, Tang said. By comparison, about 6 percent of mice breathing simple vapor and none of the mice breathing filtered air developed these lesions, the findings showed.\n\nGregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, scoffed at the results. The AVA is a nonprofit group that advocates for sensible regulation of vaping products.\n\nConley called the study and its results \u201claughable,\u201d saying that the mice were \u201cexposed to massive levels of vaping aerosol.\u201d He added that, \u201canyone who uses notoriously unreliable mice studies to discourage adult smokers from switching to nicotine vaping products should be embarrassed.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tang said this and other studies actually demonstrate that nicotine can be converted into a carcinogenic substance in the body \u2014 called nitrosamine \u2014 through a chemical process called nitrosation.\n\nThis means that nicotine, which is not considered cancer-causing, is \u201conly one step away from becoming carcinogenic,\u201d Tang said.\n\nPrevious lab studies in mouse and human cells found that nicotine can indeed convert into nitrosamine while inside the body, Tang said.\n\nThis study carries those findings forward, showing that exposure to nicotine-laced vapor increases cancer risk in mice.\n\nDr. Wasif Saif, deputy physician-in-chief and medical director of the Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Lake Success, N.Y., said that nitrosamine is a reasonable suspect for the cancer found in these mice.\n\n\u201cWe know all these products from nicotine and nicotine derivatives are carcinogens. They can cause inhibition of DNA repair in the tissues,\u201d Saif said.\n\nWhile this shows that nicotine-containing e-cigarette products probably are promoting cancer, Tang added that the proof will only come in another decade or so.\n\nThat\u2019s when e-cigarettes will have been on the market for two decades, which is about the time it takes for tobacco smokers to develop lung cancer, Tang said.\n\n\u201cThe jury is still out,\u201d Tang said. \u201cIn 10 years, we should know.\u201d\n\nHirsch agreed.\n\n\u201cThe full effect of this cannot be clinically evaluated in human beings until a longer period of time has passed,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cWe need to see much more substantial data, and of course at the end of the day it is clinical data that can tell us the real truth.\u201d\n\nThe new study was published online Oct. 7 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more about e-cigarettes.\n\nCopyright 2019 HealthDay.
