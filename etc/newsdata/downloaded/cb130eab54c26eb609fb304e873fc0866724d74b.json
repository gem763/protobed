She just has too much energy. And she\u2019s constantly bringing that for us and giving that to us.\u201d\n\nIf Delle Donne\u2019s return played a vital role in Washington\u2019s victory that put the Mystics up two games to one in the best-of-five WNBA Finals, Cloud\u2019s performance on both sides of the court altered the game in the eyes of her teammates and Coach Mike Thibault.\n\nEntering Sunday, Sun combo guard Courtney Williams had been averaging 21 points, shooting 46.7 percent from the field, including half of her 24 three-point attempts.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s Game 3, Cloud limited Williams to 2-for-9 shooting and just six points. Williams missed her lone three-point attempt and was replaced for an extended stretch late in the game by Rachel Banham.\n\n\u201cShe understands angles,\u201d Thibault said of Cloud. \u201cI think the one thing you have to do is, I thought Courtney got a little comfortable the first couple of games where she caught the ball. Tash, with all people she plays, makes them have to catch it a little bit more under duress. You don\u2019t get a clean look when you catch it.\u201d\n\nAn example came late in the third quarter, with the Mystics leading 65-55, Cloud forced Williams into a rare misstep, jarred the ball loose, and hit the floor to grab it first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bigger, stronger, so muscling her off before she comes off the screens,\u201d Cloud described her assignment as she saw it. \u201cPushing her catches out a little bit further to make her uncomfortable. Making sure that I try to stay as much attached off the ball screens and just contesting her shots.\u201d\n\n[Mystics take 2-1 lead in WNBA Finals, sparked by return of Elena Delle Donne]\n\nCloud, who does not shrink from proclaiming her superiority, added: \u201cI think I should\u2019ve been guarding her from the jump.\u201d\n\nIf the concern was that added defensive responsibilities would slow down Cloud\u2019s effectiveness as a playmaker, those proved unwarranted Sunday. Cloud finished with 19 points and four assists, did not commit a turnover, and looked for her shot early and often, ultimately hitting half of her 10 three-point attempts.\n\nCloud noticed right away that the Sun was guarding her with a less mobile defender, Shekinna Stricklen, and that Stricklen was going under screens, meaning that if Cloud got the ball on the perimeter, she would have a clean look at a three-point attempt.\n\n\u201cPlaying my role for the team, hitting open shots when they go to double, but I\u2019m prepared for this,\u201d Cloud said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for this and I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nThat work showed up in the numbers. Cloud was a 23.5-percent three-point shooter in 2017. Over the past two seasons, she\u2019s at 34.8 percent, and in the 2019 playoffs, that\u2019s jumped to 41.7 percent.\n\n\u201cTash, when she makes some threes early, that puts a lot of pressure on teams,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cShe\u2019s worked so hard on that part of her game this year. She\u2019s gone from being a high 20s, low 30s percent shooter from three, to the mid-30s which is now like shooting 50-some percent from two. And that\u2019s a big part of it. And when she makes those shots, now you\u2019re kind of in trouble as a defensive team.\u201d\n\n[No one has more WNBA wins than Mike Thibault. But his first title has been elusive.]\n\nBeyond the raw numbers, though, Cloud never stopped leading her team. In a huddle with Delle Donne and the championship-pedigreed Kristi Toliver, Cloud was giving instructions.\n\nEven her time on the bench was active: She stood throughout, edging closer and closer to the court, at one point an official gently motioning to her to move back when she\u2019d actually crossed the line.\n\nHer body language suited every situation. When Emma Meesseman hit three three-pointers early in the fourth quarter, Cloud celebrated with two hands, each with three fingers outstretched, while stomping, getting into a celebratory crouch.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. You see how low I got?\u201d Cloud said, crediting the training staff for helping her flexibility.\n\nShe seemed to soak in every moment, even playing peek-a-boo with a towel she\u2019d wrapped around her neck with a former college teammate in the crowd.\n\nWhen it was over, Cloud dribbled out the last few seconds, and as the buzzer sounded, had one final message for her team as they lined up for the postgame handshake line: two fingers in the air.", "description": "\u2018She\u2019s our energy\u2019: With a complete performance, guard has Washington one victory away from its first championship.", "authors": ["Howard Megdal", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rPK3T1FHqsY3ORTbySz0kRH1xnQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RS4H5CHDYEI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
