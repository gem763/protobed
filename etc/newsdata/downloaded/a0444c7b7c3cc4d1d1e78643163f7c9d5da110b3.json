Major cities also have large numbers of accessible taxis in service.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are still many barriers to overcome including: lack of information about what is available and possible; lack of training so that front line staff do not always understand the needs of a disabled person; a general lack of understanding still about the needs of people with hidden disabilities including mental health conditions, autism and dementia who can be very challenged by the transport environment.\u201d\n\n10 cities with highest number of accessible taxis\n\nLiverpool (2.9)\n\nCoventry (2.3)\n\nLondon (2.3)\n\nWorcester (2.0)\n\nManchester (2.0)\n\nNorwich (1.5)\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne (1.5)\n\nSheffield (1.4)\n\nPlymouth (1.3)\n\nPreston (1.3)\n\n10 cities with lowest number accessible taxis\n\nLincoln (0.3)\n\nSouthampton (0.3)\n\nCanterbury (0.2)\n\nYork (0.2)\n\nGloucester (0.1)\n\nCounty Durham (0.1)\n\nLancaster (0.1)\n\nBath (and North East Somerset) (0.1)\n\nLichfield (0.1)\n\nWakefield (0.1)", "description": "More than four fifths of all local authorities in England have fewer than one wheelchair accessible taxi per 1,000 people, according to new research.
