A pauper\u2019s burial or whatever is suitable. I have assured the commissioner of CS of NSW of my wishes.\u201d\n\nHis brother, who is in line to inherit all of Milat's possessions, agreed with the idea that the Corrective Services should \"foot the bill\", because they had \"had him all his time\".\n\nHe added: \"(The taxpayer) can be outraged. It was the taxpayer that put him in there, it\u2019s the taxpayer that has to pay, and remember I\u2019m one of them too.\u201d\n\nMr Milat maintains that his brother was not responsible for the killings.\n\n\"He was an all-round nice bloke. We don't believe for one second that he did it,\" he told The Daily Telegraph.\n\n(Image: Fairfax Media via Getty)\n\n(Image: 10 News)\n\nDespite his conviction that Milat was innocent, his brother has decided to hold a private crematorium and not to erect a gravestone - fearing irate members of the public would disrupt or vandalise them.\n\nThe convicted murderer signed off the letter with a small stick figure with a halo and the word 'innocent'.\n\nHe died two days later at the end of a six month struggle with throat and stomach cancer.\n\nThe families of the dead feared the killer would go to his deathbed without ever confessing to the crimes that shocked Australia and the world.\n\nHe had been moved to the city's Prince of Wales Hospital on October 11 from Goulbourn Supermax jail, where he had been serving his life sentence in solitary confinement.\n\nMilat was arrested in 1994 following one of the biggest police investigations in Australian history.\n\n(Image: 10 News)\n\nIt was triggered by the discovery of seven bodies in shallow graves in the Belanglo State Forest, southwest of Sydney, during 1992 and 1993.\n\nMilat is also suspected of being involved in at least three other missing persons cases.\n\nThe disappearances of three women in the Newcastle region of NSW, near where Milat was roadworking in the 1970s, remain unsolved.\n\nThe dead bodies were uncovered by a group of orienteers which stumbled upon two decaying corpses partially buried in the woodland.\n\nThey were British nannies Joanne Walters, 22, and Caroline Clarke, 21.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nCaroline had gone to Australia in 1991 on a dream working holiday, having spent months saving up to pay for her trip by working at Pizza Hut.\n\nShe and Mid Glamorgan nanny Joanne were hitching from Sydney down the Hume Highway when they accepted a lift from Milat.\n\nWhen the missing persons alarm was raised Caroline\u2019s parents flew out to Australia in August, 1992, to help in the search.\n\nThe following month the bodies of both backpackers were found in shallow graves.\n\nCaroline had been stabbed and shot 10 times in the head.\n\nIn an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald Caroline's dad Ian expressed hopes the serial killer would admit to all the crimes he was suspected of before dying.\n\n(Image: Chronicle Live WS)\n\n\"It's a horrible way for anybody to end their life but then it was even more horrible the way our daughter and so many others lost theirs, so sympathy isn't high on the list, I'm afraid,\" he said.\n\n\"If he was to finally face up to the fact and admit to any others that he has done, if indeed he has, then I think that would be a wonderful thing for those parents, because for the short time that we didn't know, I know just how they must be feeling.\n\n\"It was in its way a form of closure, that we'd found her and we were able to lay her to rest properly. It's these other parents who don't have the luxury of being able to do that.\"\n\nOver the course of the next year the remains of five more victims were discovered - including the body of decapitated traveller Anja Habschied, whose head has never been found.\n\nMilat's other victims included Deborah Everist and James Gibson, both 19, from Victoria, Simone Schmidl, 21, from Germany, and Gabor Neugebauer, 21, from Germany\n\nMilat had been a road worker at the time of his crimes, giving the weapons-obsessed ex-convict opportunity to scope out the forest alongside the remote highway as his hitchhiker hunting ground.\n\nIt was noted during his trial many victims were shot multiple times, as if he had been using them for target practice.\n\nCourt documents showed sexual interference with the corpses, either before or after the victims' deaths, in all but one case.\n\nMilat was convicted in 1996 and jailed for life.\n\nThe serial killer had previously spent time in hospital before his final trip to his deathbed.\n\nIn 2009 Milat cut off his pinky finger with a plastic knife - reportedly with the intent to send it to the High Court.\n\nThe finger could not be surgically reattached.\n\nIn 2001 he injured himself swallowing razors and staples, before losing 25kg in a hunger strike he hoped would convince prison staff to get him a Playstation.", "description": "The notorious serial killer died in Long Bay prison in Sydney, Australia", "authors": ["Milo Boyd", "Image", "News", "Reuters", "Fairfax Media Via Getty", "Chronicle Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12928526.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_160718SLUG_713JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
