It maintains a naval blockade of the enclave and along with Egypt imposes tight restrictions at land borders, citing security concerns.\n\nHamas and Israel have fought three wars in the past decade.", "description": "Israeli aircraft struck in Gaza on Wednesday hours after rockets from the Palestinian enclave triggered sirens that forced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu off the stage at an election rally in Israel.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428659540&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A00N", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
