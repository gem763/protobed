'I was trying to get the referee's attention, and then the elbow came in.\n\nFrance were leading at the point Sebastien Vahaamahina elbowed Aaron Wainwright\n\nVahaamahina was sent off after the 47th minute leaving France with 33 minutes to hang on\n\nVahaamahina's mistake proved costly as Wales would go on to win 20-19 after a late try\n\n'I was a bit surprised the referee didn't see it to start off with, but thankfully the television match official pulled it up and it was dealt with. We put the pressure on afterwards and saw the game through.\n\n'I am fine at the moment. It wasn't that nice at the time.'\n\nWainwright scored a first-half try - his first for Wales - as the Six Nations champions ultimately fought back and prevailed through Ross Moriarty's late touchdown that Dan Biggar converted.\n\n'The ball popped up and I can't really remember what happened apart from sprinting towards the line,' Wainwright added.\n\n'We have been building for the past 18 months and the belief has always been there. Coming in at half- time behind, we still had belief we could get the job done.\n\n'It is a massive achievement for the team. It's great to come away with the win and look forward to the semi-final and eyes on the final as well. To hopefully come away with a trophy at the end of it would be nice.\n\nAaron Wainwright had a big part to play in Wales' victory also scoring their first try of the game\n\n'Today showed we can grit it out and get the job done, even if it wasn't the prettiest.'\n\nWainwright, supporting a fully-grown moustache, explained his stag-impression celebration.\n\n'I've got a sevens team back home called The Stags, so that was what the celebration was about,' he said.\n\n'With the moustache, all my mates went to Prague on a boys' holiday and said they were going to grow moustaches. They said if I grew one they would crop me into the photographs just so I didn't feel like I was missing out.\n\n'I certainly don't feel like I am missing out now, being here.'", "description": "Wales qualified for the World Cup semi-finals after a late 20-19 win against France.
