The air quality near the wedding venue got so bad that many of the wedding events had to be moved indoors. But the wedding went forward, and the couple held the ceremony itself outside despite the hazards.\n\nWhile taking a few photos in the vineyard, the couple thought they might as well capture some images with the protective masks, which people across the region have been wearing due to the toxic air.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and I thought, is this the new normal for wine country in October?\u201d said Roa, who lives in Castro Valley, south of Sonoma county, and regularly shoots wine country weddings. The moment the couple put the masks on, it reminded Roa of the 1930 painting American Gothic, she said.\n\nRelated: California wildfires leave destruction across the state \u2013 in pictures\n\nThis is Roa\u2019s fourth wedding in the last three years that has been evacuated or disrupted by wildfires. The 43-year-old\u2019s parents, who live in nearby Sebastopol, were evacuated as the Kincade fire spread and are now staying at her Castro Valley home, which has no power due to the Pacific Gas and Electric shutoffs.\n\nRoa said the wedding was a success but that it was a surreal experience while the fires were raging in the region: \u201cThe joy won out, it was a happy wedding \u2026 But all of us were caught in that dichotomy of joy and sorrow. As a photographer, it\u2019s easy for me to get lost in the moment and feel the joy of the couple.\u201d\n\nShe said she hoped the viral image would help people outside California understand the suffering in the region: \u201cIt\u2019s helping to bring light to the crisis and destruction going on here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people who are still having major life events, and it\u2019s happening right in the middle of a firestorm,\u201d she added.", "description": "Image shows Katie and Curtis Ferland in burning wine country as photographer wonders: \u2018Is this the new normal?\u2019Katie and Curtis Ferland\u2019s wedding photo in Sonoma county.
