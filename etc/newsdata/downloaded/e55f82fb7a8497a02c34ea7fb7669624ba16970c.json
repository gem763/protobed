A \u00a330 contactless spending limit is imposed by the banks for each purchase to protect customers if their card is stolen.\n\nA security loophole is allowing fraudsters to break the \u00a330 spending limit for contactless bank cards (stock photo)\n\nBut a shopping exercise by the Daily Mail discovered just how easy it is to break this limit.\n\nA reporter used a Royal Bank of Scotland debit card to buy a \u00a349.99 dress and a \u00a319.99 skirt from the clothing chain Zara with two tap-and-go payments of \u00a330 and another for \u00a39.98.\n\nWaitrose took two contactless payments of \u00a330 and \u00a310 for a \u00a340 electric toothbrush.\n\nAnother reporter used his Santander debit card to pay for a \u00a360.98 meal from a high street Indian restaurant chain in three taps of \u00a320.34, \u00a320.32 and \u00a320.32.\n\nA \u00a340.10 shopping bill at Whole Foods supermarket was allowed in two payments of \u00a330 and \u00a310.10. And the Mail also used a Tesco credit card to pay for a \u00a350.63 restaurant meal in two payments of \u00a325.62 and \u00a325.01.\n\nIn contrast, attempts to make multiple tap-and-go payments for a purchase at Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury's were refused by staff or the second payment declined by the card machine.\n\nWaitrose took two contactless payments of \u00a330 and \u00a310 for a \u00a340 electric toothbrush (stock photo)\n\nDavid Emm, of the internet security consultancy Kaspersky Lab, said: 'The whole point of the limit is it reduces the scope of any loss if there is any criminal activity.\n\n'This loophole makes a mockery of the limit and gives criminals more scope to go on a spending spree with a stolen card before the customer gets the chance to report it.\n\n'It sounds as if [banks] are exploiting this loophole that is there by accident or design but retailers should be enforcing the limit too.'\n\nWes Streeting, a Labour member of the Treasury committee, said: 'This is ludicrous. The \u00a330 limit is there because the banks recognise these cards make it easier for criminals to steal our money. If people can tap their card multiple times for the same purchase the limit is clearly rendered meaningless.'\n\nBanks are obliged to refund customers for money fraudulently taken from their account unless they are deemed to have been careless with their card, PIN or account details.\n\nA reporter used a Royal Bank of Scotland debit card to buy a \u00a349.99 dress and a \u00a319.99 skirt from the clothing chain Zara with two tap-and-go payments of \u00a330 and another for \u00a39.98 (stock photo)\n\nGuy Anker, of the consumer website Moneysavingexpert, said: 'Limits are there for people's protection. The industry needs to get its act together.'\n\nUK Finance, which represents banks, said contactless cards have an inbuilt security feature that means account holders are required from time to time to enter their PIN.\n\nIt added tougher rules are being introduced to require customers to enter their PIN after every five contactless payments or once they have spent \u00a3130.\n\nIt said fraud on contactless cards was 'low' with \u00a310.2million of losses on \u00a338billion of spending in the first half of the year.\n\nA shopping exercise by the Daily Mail discovered just how easy it is to break this limit (stock photo)\n\nSantander said: 'We use a very sophisticated model to detect unusual transactions based on each customer's regular spending patterns and a number of other factors.\n\n'In this instance [the Mail reporter's transaction] there was not enough to trigger additional checks.'\n\nResponding to the toothbrush purchase, a Waitrose spokesman said: 'This should not have happened and was clearly an error by one individual.\n\n'We will be reminding our partners that they shouldn't accept more than one contactless payment on the same card within a single transaction.'\n\nZara declined to comment.
