After telling Zelensky that \u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d Trump said, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.\u201d As the whistle-blower complaint explained, Trump was repeating a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers, in 2016, perhaps with the assistance of CrowdStrike, an American cybersecurity firm that investigated the D.N.C. breach. \u201cI do not know why the President associates these servers with Ukraine,\u201d the whistle-blower wrote. (No credible evidence of such a conspiracy has emerged\u2014nor has an explanation for why Democrats would release private e-mails that damaged Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and aided Trump.)\n\nOn Sunday, Tom Bossert, a former senior White House aide, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he had informed Trump that the theory was false, and blamed Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, for feeding it to him. \u201cI am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing, and repeating that debunked theory to the President,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again.\u201d (Bossert later said, \u201cIn fairness, I don\u2019t know that it was Rudy Giuliani that put that conspiracy theory into the President\u2019s head,\u201d but \u201cI know somebody did.\u201d)\n\nBossert\u2019s frustration echoes the concerns of several current and former Trump aides. All American Presidents are the focus of myriad disinformation campaigns designed to influence their thinking. Domestic political rivals use public statements and private flattery to attempt to sway the President\u2019s world view. Aides jostle to be seen as the most effective, resolute, and loyal lieutenant. But, under Trump, the amount of disinformation circulating in the White House has reached a new level, former Trump Administration officials told me. Trump is barraged with information from aides, political rivals, Fox News, and Twitter, much of it clearly designed to play to his long-held beliefs and biases. The former officials added that internecine battles among Trump\u2019s White House advisers sometimes exacerbate the amount of faulty information being presented to the President.\n\nSome aides also genuinely believe the conspiracy theories. This summer, a senior intelligence official told me that Trump\u2019s Attorney General, William Barr, is convinced that there is something nefarious in how the F.B.I. started its investigation, in 2016, of possible ties between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials. This spring, Trump authorized Barr to carry out sweeping reviews of the investigation\u2019s origins and of an Intelligence Community assessment that found that Russia intervened in 2016 to benefit Trump. In May, Barr appointed the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the review, but Trump and Barr have contributed to the investigation. This week, Justice Department officials confirmed that Barr had asked Trump to personally request that the leader of Australia aid Barr\u2019s inquiry, and also that Barr and Durham travelled to Italy last week to ask intelligence officials there to assist the probe. Former Justice Department officials expressed surprise about Barr\u2019s involvement. A senior intelligence official called the claims of an international plot\u2014such as the Obama Administration asking British intelligence to surveil Trump Tower\u2014\u201cpreposterous.\u201d The official pointed out that the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee has already investigated the origins of the F.B.I.\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation and found no wrongdoing.\n\nSome former Trump Administration officials agreed that the President and some of his aides trafficked in conspiracy theories, but they also defended his policies. Although they recognized his personal flaws, they expressed support of his efforts to confront China, to force American allies to pay more for their own defense, and to prevent the U.S. from being drawn into another war in the Middle East. When presented with good information, they contended, the President makes good decisions. Others said that they had lost faith in the President and his policies after observing his decision-making. A former senior national-security official told me that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both did a better job of weighing information. \u201cThat\u2019s why the President gets the big bucks,\u201d he told me. \u201cTo discern where the preponderance of the evidence lies, to discern where the more persuasive argument lies.\u201d\n\nThe former national-security official noted that disinformation had complicated Trump\u2019s decision-making regarding policy in Afghanistan, in 2017. Some aides were telling Trump that he should adopt a proposal from Erik Prince, the brother of the Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, to use private contractors rather than American soldiers to secure Afghanistan. The official said that the option was presented in an appealing but unrealistic way. \u201cAn American company will do this cheaper and better without young Americans in uniform dying,\u201d he said, paraphrasing the argument made by backers of the plan. Trump was also told that China was making large amounts of money in Afghanistan, while the U.S. provided the country\u2019s security, which played to Trump\u2019s sense that America was being taken advantage of by the Chinese. In fact, both claims were highly misleading. Guards from Prince\u2019s former private-security company, Blackwater, had been convicted of killing more than a dozen civilians in a 2007 shooting in Baghdad; deploying a large number of Blackwater-like security contractors likely would have fuelled a surge in anti-American sentiment among Afghans and aided the Taliban insurgency. The scale of Chinese profits was exaggerated. American defense contracts had, in fact, made far larger profits in Afghanistan than had Chinese firms. In the end, the proposal to use private contractors was rejected, and Trump kept thousands of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nLast year, conspiracy theories from outside the White House nearly derailed the passage of a major piece of legislation. On January 10, 2018, the White House issued a statement supporting the renewal of Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, a post-9/11 program that allows U.S. intelligence agencies to collect the communications of foreigners overseas without a warrant\u2014including when they are speaking with Americans. The next morning, on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Andrew Napolitano, the network\u2019s top judicial analyst, directly appealed to Trump to change his position on the bill. \u201cMr. President, this is not the way to go,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cSpying is valid to find the foreign agents among us. But it\u2019s got to be based on suspicion and not an area code.\u201d Napolitano went on to invoke the debunked conspiracy theory that British intelligence agencies had spied on Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. Napolitano had first floated the theory a year earlier; it was repeated by Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary. Stunned British intelligence officials, in a rare public rebuke, dismissed the claim as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cutterly ridiculous.\u201d The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee also investigated the claim and found it to be false.\n\nForty-five minutes after Napolitano asked Trump to oppose the law, the President tweeted, \u201cThis is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\u201d Fearing that the legislation would fail to pass without Trump\u2019s support, aides convened an Oval Office meeting. John Kelly, then the White House chief of staff; H. R. McMaster, then the national-security adviser; Dan Coats, then the director of National Intelligence; Mike Pompeo, then the C.I.A. director; and Paul Ryan, then the Speaker of the House, who joined by phone, convinced Trump to reverse his reversal. \u201cToday\u2019s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe need it! Get smart!\u201d\n\nFormer officials said that they came to the conclusion that the character flaws they saw while working for Trump prevent the President from delivering on his agenda. They said that the President makes false statements, distrusts his own staff at times, and looks to outsiders for guidance. Now the pursuit of a conspiracy theory could lead to Trump\u2019s impeachment. Under attack, Trump is defending himself in the way he knows how\u2014by claiming that the whistle-blower complaint is itself a conspiracy. On Wednesday, he said that he believed Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee, \u201chelped write\u201d the complaint, and dismissed it as a \u201cscam.\u201d Schiff flatly denied Trump\u2019s claims.", "description": "David Rohde writes on how disinformation and conspiracy theories circulate in the Trump White House, with the President receiving, from myriad sources, information designed to play to his existing beliefs and biases.", "authors": ["David Rohde", "Ronan Farrow", "Anna Shechtman", "Rachel Aviv", "John Seabrook", "Isaac Chotiner", "John Cassidy"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d9533f427c9b4000888d1db/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Rohde-ConspiraciesTrump-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
