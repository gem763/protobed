U.S. officials said the two were captured in western Iraq.\n\nUsing names and locations that the wife and courier gave up, two U.S. officials said on Sunday, the CIA and Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officers began recruiting agents along the routes that al-Baghdadi traveled in the desert astride the Syrian-Iraqi border. Officials began surveilling routes he used, places he stopped, and looking for patterns to his travel, including his brief stays in small villages such as the one where he died.\n\nThe U.S. Special Operations Command, based in Tampa, Florida, had standing plans for targeting al-Baghdadi and his small inner circle, said a third official. Some called for the use of drones, which the CIA and the military have employed in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere, this official said. Others relied more heavily on inserting Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs on the ground, as the U.S. did in targeting al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.\n\nThe official described the plans as \u201cbasic blueprints\u201d and said they were rehearsed and updated constantly as ISIS lost its grip on cities such as Mosul, where the group\u2019s leaders hid among thousands of civilians.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we could have done this without the help we got from the Syrian and Iraqi Kurds, which continued after we began the troop pullout,\u201d one of the officials said, quickly adding that Iraq military and intelligence officers \u201ckicked the whole thing off.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave approval for the operation, codenamed Kayla Mueller after an American woman taken hostage, raped repeatedly and murdered, to begin on Friday (5 p.m. EDT), the first two officials said, and the raid began at roughly midnight local time at the airfield in Erbil, Iraq with a mix of eight Apache attack and CH-47 Chinook helicopters carrying Delta Force special operators and at least one dog.\n\nThe attackers flew low to avoid detection for about 70 miles from Erbil to Barisha, a village just north of Idlib where al-Baghdadi, his bodyguards, and some of his children were spending the night.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announces the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a raid by American special operations forces in Syria, in remarks at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 27, 2019. | Gabriella Demczuk for TIME More\n\nAs the attackers approached their landing zone outside the building that housed al-Baghdadi, which spies had described and which unmanned U.S. surveillance planes and satellites had photographed, the Apache helicopters and fixed-wing warplanes laid down a barrage of covering fire, the officials said, heavily damaging the compound.\n\nFollowing standard procedure, the force first tried to persuade the inhabitants to leave the compound, but without success, then blew holes in the walls rather than using the doors or windows.", "description": "In the end, officials say two people captured in western Iraq gave up information that led to the ISIS leader", "authors": ["John Walcott"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3tDEaHSQbQvWctsHqDGmhQ--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/a97020dd6bb834051744a7bd0ddaf649", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
