Kamala Harris endorsed banning plastic straws during CNN's climate change town hall forum on Wednesday but conceded that their paper counterparts leave much to be desired.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate was asked what she would do as president to drastically curb the use of single-use plastics.\n\nHarris pointed to how the state of California had banned plastic bags and said there should be incentives against single-use plastics.\n\n\"Plastic straws a big thing. Do you ban plastic straws?\" CNN moderator Erin Burnett asked.\n\n\"I think we should, yes. I\u2019m going to be honest. It is difficult on drink out of a paper straw. Like if you don\u2019t gulp it down immediately, it starts to bends and then the little thing catches it. We have to kind of perfect that one a little bit more,\" Harris said.\n\n\"Innovation is a process ... But you know, let\u2019s encourage innovation. I think we can do a little better than some of those flimsy plastic straws, but we do need to ban the plastic straws,\" she added.\n\nHarris also said she would support ending the Senate filibuster in order to pass the Green New Deal.", "description": "California Sen.
