REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo REUTERS\n\n\u201cThey were the deciding factor here \u2013 not the MCAS, not the Max.\u201d\n\nLangewiesche describes the performance of the Lion Air captain, Bhavye Suneja, as \u201cabysmal\u201d, as he struggled to control the jet with 189 people onboard after take-off from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.\n\n\u201cIn my own flying life, each of the four trim runaways I have experienced has been at most a 10-second problem \u2013 eight seconds to be surprised, and two seconds to flip the electric trim off.\u201d\n\nHe says: \u201cThe 737 features two prominent toggle switches on the centre pedestal whose sole purpose is to deal with such an event \u2013 a pilot simply switches them off to disengage the electric trim.\n\n\u201cThey are known as trim cutout switches. They are big and fat and right behind the throttles. There is not a 737 pilot in the world who is unaware of them.\n\n\u201cBoeing assumed that if necessary, 737 Max pilots would flip them much as previous generations of 737 pilots had. It would be at most a 30-second event. This turned out to be an obsolete assumption.\u201d\n\nHe describes the Lion Air first officer, known simply as Harvino, as \u201cweak in an essential quality known as airmanship\u201d, and is disparaging of safety standards in Indonesia.\n\nLangewiesche claims that in Indonesian flight simulators, used for training, that the usual complement of two pilots flying and one instructing is augmented: \u201cThere are sometimes seven in there: two pilots flying, one instructing and four others standing up and logging the time.\u201d\n\nIndonesia\u2019s chaotic aviation industry is characterised, says Langewiesche, by: \u201cAn onrush of inexperienced pilots willing to work long hours for low pay; discouragement among mechanics, ramp workers and dispatchers; pressure to keep aeroplanes flying despite component failures that should have grounded them; the falsification of cargo and passenger manifests; dual maintenance and flight logs; and corruption permeating the entire system, including even air-traffic control.\u201d\n\nThe writer criticises the air-traffic controller in Jakarta for failing to identify there was something seriously wrong with the Lion Air flight, saying: \u201cIt is hard to imagine what the controller was thinking.\n\n\u201cOne of his headings steered the flight away from conflicting traffic, when instead it was the traffic that should have been steered away from the flight.\n\n\u201cEqually unfortunate was the acquiescence of Suneja and Harvino, who dutifully complied with every air-traffic control request.\u201d\n\nIn both the crashes, the MCAS activated in response to a single faulty angle-of-attack sensor, which measures the angle of the wing to the airflow.\n\n\u201cOne of Boeing\u2019s bewildering failures in the MCAS design is that despite the existence of two independent angle-of-attack sensors,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe system did not require agreement between them to conclude that a stall had occurred.\u201d\n\nLangewiesche believes the faulty instrument involved in the Lion Air crash was obtained from a supplier in a district of Miami that is known as \u201cCockroach Corner\u201d because of the number of aircraft parts of dubious origin and quality.\n\nHe writes: \u201cThe angle-of-attack sensor on the captain\u2019s side was a slapped-on unit from \u2018Cockroach Corner\u2019 that was 20 degrees out of whack.\u201d\n\nAfter the Lion Air crash, the American safety regulator, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive about the MCAS problem: \u201cThis condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the aeroplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain.\u201d\n\nCaptain Yared Getachew and first officer Ahmed Nur Mohammod Nur, who were on the flight deck of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, were aware of the possible problem.\n\nBut their attempts to overcome the MCAS were in vain because their Boeing 737 Max was flying much too fast.\n\nLangewiesche writes: \u201cThe excessive speed was amply clear in the cockpit, where an overspeed clacker was sounding off, but neither pilot thought to reduce the thrust and slow down.\u201d\n\nAfter the first accident report into flight 302, the airline issued a statement saying: \u201cThe preliminary report clearly showed that the Ethiopian Airlines pilots who were commanding Flight ET302 followed Boeing's recommended and FAA's approved emergency procedures to handle the most difficult emergency situation created on the aeroplane.\n\n\u201cDespite their hard work and full compliance with the emergency procedures, it was very unfortunate that they could not recover the aeroplane from the persistence of nose diving.\u201d\n\nWhile Langewiesche is critical of the aircraft manufacturer, he does not think that corners were cut on safety in order to make money: \u201cAlthough Boeing\u2019s designers were aware of timetables and competitive pressures, the mistakes they made were honest ones, or stupid ones, or maybe careless ones, but not a result of an intentional sacrifice of safety for gain.\u201d\n\nThe planemaker\u2019s chairman, president and chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said: \u201dThe tragic loss of life in both accidents continues to weigh heavily on all of us at Boeing, and we have the utmost sympathy for the loved ones of those onboard.\u201d\n\nBoeing has been working relentlessly on fixes to allow the plane to return to commercial service, and still believes the Max could be flying passengers as early as October. But Langewiesche writes: \u201cThe reintroduction of the 737 Max will be exceedingly difficult because of political and bureaucratic obstacles that are formidable and widespread.\u201d\n\nThe acting head of the FAA, Steve Dickson, is a pilot and has said that he will not sign off the Boeing 737 Max until he has flown it himself.\n\nIn the UK, Norwegian and TUI Airways are waiting to bring their 737 Max jets back into service.\n\nRyanair, which has ordered 210 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in a unique, high-density configuration, has yet to operate the plane.", "description": "Six months after the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, a writer who has forensically investigated two fatal crashes has blamed the poor performance of pilots.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/20/10/ethiopian-airlines-crash.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
