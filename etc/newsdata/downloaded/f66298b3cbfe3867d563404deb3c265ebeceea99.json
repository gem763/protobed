We\u2019re down to the short straws. Even so, there\u2019s still time for each party to commit to a policy innovation that would please a large majority of Canadians, certainly among those who watched Tuesday\u2019s English-language leaders\u2019 debate: abolish the federal Leaders\u2019 Debates Commission. The reviews were all but unanimous. The Phoenix pay system aside, have we had a clearer recent example of government failure?\n\nThe debate failed at the most basic level. The transcript shows that \u201cRt. Hon. Justin Trudeau\u201d made or attempted to make 135 interventions. \u201cHon. Andrew Scheer\u201d was second with 128. In third place came \u201cCrosstalk,\u201d a designation that appears 114 times, a number that in fact strikes me as admirable restraint on the part of whoever the heroic transcriber was. (For the record, the rest of the candidates intervened, or tried to, as follows: Singh 111 times, Bernier 105, Blanchet 104 and May 101.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve been watching the Democratic presidential debates this election season, you\u2019ll have noted how, with characteristic ingenuity, the Americans have come up with a clever technology for dealing with this problem of crosstalk, one that all but eliminates the phenomenon even in debates featuring 10 candidates, let alone six. What they do is \u2014 you won\u2019t believe how smart this is \u2014 they require any debater who wants to say something to raise his, her or their hand. Then only when the moderator gives permission, do they talk. How simple! How elegant! How imaginative!\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to be the polite North Americans. Yet our leaders barge ahead and do what none of us, probably none of them either, would do in ordinary conversation and klaxon away like barroom bullies. By contrast, the (we often think) loudmouthed sometimes even boorish Americans are models of good behaviour. Watch next time. Even a former vice-president of the United States politely holds up his hand, waiting to be called.\n\nThe Americans aren\u2019t doing it out of politeness, of course. They\u2019re submitting to regulation by the moderator \u2014 whereas in our usually regulation-loving country the one place we indulge in laissez-faire is where it creates a tragedy of the commons: i.e., systematic overlapping claims on a scarce resource, in this case the audience\u2019s ability to hear.\n\nTo be sure, if you\u2019re going to submit to a moderator, you need a moderator willing to do the job. I remember a federal leaders\u2019 debate in which moderator Ann Medina of the CBC began by saying she hated to interrupt other people when they were talking. That should have disqualified her. The moderator\u2019s only real duty is to be a traffic cop and cut people off. But if you do assert yourself, even if you have to be a bit of an ass to do so, debaters will start behaving themselves. To this end, though I hate to say it, it\u2019s better not to have print journalists be moderator. You need people who are used to thinking quickly under lights in front of cameras.\n\nAnd there really is technology that can help. In their presidential debates, the French superimpose a clock under the candidates that shows how much each has spoken. When candidates fall behind in time used, the moderator can take this into account in deciding how long to let people run on. Time-tracking of this sort is standard in curling and chess. Why not in debates, too?\n\nTime-tracking also affords the possibility of differing time allocations. In 10 federal elections since 1984 the Green party has contested 2,294 ridings. It has won precisely twice. Why does its leader get equal time with candidates whose parties have over the same period won hundreds and hundreds more seats? To be fair, Green did win a byelection in May, thus doubling its current parliamentary representation to two, its all-time high. On the other hand, Maxime Bernier has been elected four times, so all on his own he\u2019s still ahead of the Greens.\n\nIn the post-debate coverage, CBC\u2019s Vassy Kapelos said dismissively of Bernier\u2019s presence that he had no chance of becoming prime minister. But neither does Elizabeth May, Jagmeet Singh or Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet. Using an on-screen clock, we could allocate debate time in proportion to where candidates are in the polls. Or, like U.S. Republicans in 2016, we could have two-tier debates, one for possible prime ministers and a second for possible kingmakers.\n\nWith a running clock for each candidate you also wouldn\u2019t need to chop up the debate into dozens of 40-second debate-lets. That only encourages sound-bite responses, which are a problem with our culture, not one of its shining points. You\u2019ve got two hours (though you should have more). You could have six 20-minute discussions on different topics, if you want. Since the debaters seldom are constrained by the subject you could also do away with high-technology attempts to make Canadians feel as if we\u2019re participating. I don\u2019t actually want to hear what a carefully selected person in Yukon or B.C. or Nova Scotia thinks. I want to hear what the candidates think. And part of what they think is what they believe is important to discuss.\n\nIn 40-second bites you\u2019re testing candidates\u2019 ability to memorize one-liners. Force them to talk for minutes in a row without a tele-prompter and you\u2019ll get some idea of how well, if at all, they think.", "description": "Our leaders barge ahead and do what none of us, probably none of them either, would do in ordinary conversation and klaxon away like barroom bullies", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/debate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
