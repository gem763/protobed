But a corruption scandal involving UAW leadership, the spread of right-to-work laws across the Midwest, and the pain of participating in this week\u2019s strike have some auto workers wondering if union membership still has its privileges.\n\nThe UAW represents more than auto workers, but they\u2019re still the core of the union\u2019s membership, with the bulk residing in five Midwestern states: Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. Since 2011, all but Ohio have become right-to-work states, meaning workers can no longer be forced to pay dues or fees to the UAW.\n\nAt the turn of the century the total number of \u201ctransportation equipment manufacturing\u201d employees in those five Midwestern states and total UAW members were roughly the same\u2014715,200 and 701,800, respectively\u2014according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and federal filings by the union. That held true until 2009, when both numbers plummeted. During the worst of the Great Recession in 2009, Chrysler and General Motors declared bankruptcy. More than 100,000 jobs were lost at GM alone.\n\nNot long after, things began to change. In 2012, Indiana became a right-to-work state. Michigan followed the same year, Wisconsin in 2015, and Kentucky in 2017. Since 2011, the number of auto workers in those five states has grown by nearly 160,000, or 36.4%, according to the BLS. Yet in 2018 the union saw its first annual decline in membership in a decade, losing 35,000 members, or 8.1%. That reduced the net membership increase since 2011 to 15,000.\n\nThere are many reasons UAW members choose to quit the union, and despite the solidarity on display in the current strike, the rank-and-file have serious issues with the way the union has been run. In pushing for a strike at GM, UAW leadership insisted that employees skip work and forgo their full wages and benefits to pressure management to reach a deal. As the strike continues, UAW members may wonder whether their dues are worth paying when union negotiation requires them to sacrifice part of their livelihoods.\n\nThey also should wonder whether union leaders are looking out for the membership\u2019s interests or their own. Many high-ranking UAW officials are embroiled in a corruption scandal. The Justice Department has charged 10 defendants with crimes ranging from embezzlement and money laundering to mail and wire fraud. Earlier this week the Detroit News reported that federal agents have searched the California home of recently retired UAW chief Dennis Williams. UAW leaders allegedly spent more than $1 million in union money on fancy resorts, rounds of golf, clothing, expensive alcohol and cigars, and more. Perhaps worse in the eyes of some members, the UAW used nonunion labor to build a retirement home for its recent president.\n\nThe UAW also has a political problem. Nearly 40% of all union members voted for President Trump in 2016, including an estimated 28% of UAW members, according to the union\u2019s own survey. But the UAW heavily supports the Democratic Party, nearly unanimously endorsing and supporting Democrats at the local, state and national levels.\n\nPolitics could fray the relationship with workers. Progressive elements have pulled the Democratic Party left on issues like fracking and pipelines, which are important to the automotive industry. Democrats are also increasingly pushing for electric and smaller vehicles\u2014part of the party\u2019s larger shift toward weighing environmental interests over traditional blue-collar concerns.\n\nWorkers have options these days. The UAW can no longer rely on their compelled support, and it would do well to listen more closely to the concerns of its members and represent those interests above all else.\n\nMr. Skorup is director of marketing and communications at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, based in Midland, Mich.
