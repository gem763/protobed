Truth is, it\u2019s not.\n\nEndometriosis affects 1 in 10 women but it can go undiagnosed for up to 20 years. The disease itself is not very well understood and diagnosing it can be hit and miss, but it is a really serious illness that can have a devastating impact.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s only now in my mid 30s that the disease has really started to impact my daily life,\u2019 says Nicky.\n\n\u2018I have had two surgeries in an attempt to slow the disease down\u2019 (Picture: Nicky Affleck)\n\nSadly, two years ago, Nicky was told that her endometriosis had advanced significantly, it was a real blow to her confidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have had two surgeries in an attempt to slow the disease down but ultimately, as of today there is no cure for the disease and the treatment of it is not 100% effective,\u2019 says Nicky.\n\n\u2018And going under the knife every year is also not the answer. More research needs to be done to really understand how it can be managed and treated.\u2019\n\nThe pain of endometriosis can be severe. Flair ups can happen at any time from debilitating abdominal pains to chronic fatigue.\n\nNicky says she is often completely reliant on painkillers, but the mental and physical boost she gets from playing sport is a real help too.\n\n\u2018Sport is a fundamental part of my life and who I am,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t survive without it, but equally on bad days, I couldn\u2019t survive without Ibuprofen. I am certain there are many women who really struggle to stay active when living in constant pain.\n\n\u2018My surgeon is pretty amazed that I\u2019m able to play a sport like hockey at all.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s genuinely tough as the disease can be so unpredictable. But through playing hockey and building a strong network of friendships around me, I am able to ask for help and seek support from friends and family around me.\n\n\u2018I also choose to keep myself as active as possible by playing hockey twice a week, going to spin classes two or three times a week and sometimes a gentle long Sunday walk with my friend and her two dogs,\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicky is lucky. She found sport at a young age and had a really positive experience of physical activity throughout her school life.\n\n\u2018Sport was the one thing that never let me down\u2019 (Picture: Nicky Affleck)\n\n\u2018Sport gave me a place to escape and a place to go where I could thrive doing something I love,\u2019 says Nicky.\n\n\u2018At the age of seven I found myself breaking records in the swimming pool, I have built a career working in the youth sport sector and today, at the age of 38 I am back playing hockey for a local London club.\n\n\u2018Sport was the one thing that never let me down and the one thing that when I committed to it, it gave me so much back.\u2019\n\nNicky rediscovered her love of sport in her mid 30s, but taking the leap back on to the hockey pitch wasn\u2019t an easy decision.\n\n\u2018It was probably one of the most daunting things I\u2019ve ever done. I wasn\u2019t a teenager anymore and my body and fitness levels had obviously changed the older I got,\u2019 says Nicky.\n\n\u2018But what did motivate me to get back into playing was a welcoming club filled with wonderful and different women.\n\n\u2018They were there because hockey gave them a place where they felt like they belonged, where they could build new friendships, and it gave them a sense of family whilst playing a game we all loved.\u2019\n\nNicky knows she isn\u2019t alone in feeling scared about jumping into a new social situation like this \u2013 she thinks it\u2019s vital that women support each other and make fitness spaces as accessible and welcoming as possible.\n\n\u2018Because people can\u2019t see it, they don\u2019t understand it and they don\u2019t know it\u2019s there\u2019 (Picture: Nicky Affleck)\n\n\u2018Often we think it\u2019s only teenager girls who fear judgement in a group setting, hence the drop off in female participation levels from the age of 11,\u2019 says Nicky. \u2018But I am living proof that it isn\u2019t just teenagers who struggle with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Most women have an intrinsic fear of not being good enough, or of others judging them.\n\n\u2018I convinced a friend to join the club with me four years ago because I was nervous to give it a go on my own. This \u201cbuddy system\u201d, for want of a better phrase, is hugely importing to women. It\u2019s a safety net. It\u2019s a common purpose. It has meaning.\n\n\u2018Today, I interact with these women on most days. More so off the hockey pitch than on. Not only do we celebrate birthdays, weddings and the arrival of babies together. We too, share each other\u2019s grief, sorrow and sadness.\n\n\u2018I call these women my friends. My family. My tribe!\u2019\n\nLiving with a chronic illness is relentless. Nicky finds that one of the hardest aspects is dealing with people\u2019s limited understanding about the female body.\n\n\u2018The most challenging thing for me is people\u2019s perception of the disease. There is this archaic idea that your time of the month is something that should be painful and cause discomfort. It isn\u2019t!\n\n\u2018Talking about it and raising awareness of the disease is the first step,\u2019 Nicky adds. \u2018This normalises the subject and gives others the opportunity and space to open up and talk.\n\n\u2018One of the hardest things for me is the fact that because people can\u2019t see it, they don\u2019t understand it and they don\u2019t know it\u2019s there. This often leads to ignorance and judgement of a person\u2019s ability or character.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicky is all about breaking down barriers and stigma \u2013 she wants there to be a wider understanding of just how common endometriosis is, and how it can affect women\u2019s lives.\n\n\u2018We need to talk more about it and we need to raise awareness. For some women, they may never know they have it, but for others it will affect them every day, making the simplest of tasks a chore.\u2019\n\nNicky knows that her commitment to staying active is a sign of strength \u2013 and she\u2019s not about to give up what she loves any time soon.\n\n\u2018Strong women are everywhere. We shine in different ways,\u2019 says Nicky. \u2018A sister. A daughter. A mother. An aunt. A partner. A friend. A teammate.\n\n\u2018Women who challenge stereotypes, who fight for equal rights, who empower others around them and who lead the way. They are everywhere.\u2019\n\nStrong Women Strong Women is a weekly series that champions diversity in the world of sport and fitness. A Sport England study found that 40% of women were avoiding physical activity due to a fear of judgement. But, contrary to the limited images we so often see, women of any age, size, race or ability can be active and enjoy sport and fitness. We hope that by normalising diverse depictions of women who are fit, strong and love their bodies, we will empower all women to shed their self-consciousness when it comes to getting active. Each week we talk to women who are redefining what it means to be strong and achieving incredible things.\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018I lost all my hair in my 30s \u2013 running without my wig gave me my power back\u2019\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018Female jockeys are just as good as men\u2019\n\nMORE: Strong Women: \u2018My rugby team fought for equality in Japan \u2013 but the fight against prejudice isn\u2019t over\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Nicky has always loved sport, and after multiple surgeries and chronic pain with endometriosis, staying active is more important than ever.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris", "Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/strong-women-2-1de6_1572084505.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
