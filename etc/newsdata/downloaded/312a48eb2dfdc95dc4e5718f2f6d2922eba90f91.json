REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nShares of the package delivery company tumbled almost 10% in extended trading after profit in its latest quarter fell short of Wall Street\u2019s goal.\n\nExecutives called out economic woes in Asia and Europe as well as the loss of Amazon, a \u201clarge customer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur performance continues to be negatively impacted by a weakening global macro environment driven by increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty,\u201d said Chief Executive Frederick Smith, who for the first time on a company conference call, acknowledged that Amazon had emerged as a shipping rival.\n\n\u201cWe basically compete in an ecosphere that\u2019s got five entities in it. There\u2019s UPS. There\u2019s DHL. There\u2019s the U.S. Postal Service. And now increasingly, there\u2019s Amazon,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe comments from Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx came as global retailers are gearing up for the all-important holiday shopping season.\n\n\u201cThis is very disappointing for all shareholders,\u201d said Trip Miller, managing director at Memphis-based hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners.\n\nWhile FedEx has been grappling with its own challenges - particularly the costly and lengthy integration of its European TNT business - it is broadly seen as a bellwether for the global economy and the broader logistics sector. Shares of rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) fell 2.4% after the report.\n\nFedEx now expects adjusted earnings of $11 to $13 per share for full-year 2020 ending May 31. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $14.69 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates.\n\nAdjusted net income fell more than 14% to $800 million, or $3.05 per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31. Revenue was flat at $17.05 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of $3.15 per share.\n\nWhile global trade is down, \u201cI think a lot of it is a FedEx problem,\u201d Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights, said of the disappointing results.\n\nFedEx is responding with a new round of cost cuts - including reducing services in its global FedEx Express air network after the holiday season. The shipping also will retire and ground dozens of planes, executives said.\n\n\u201cWe think their legacy Express Air segment is a bit pudgy right now,\u201d said Miller, who added he would like to see FedEx redeploy resources to bolster delivery for the growing e-commerce segment.\n\nShares of Fedex fell $16.46 to $156.84 in extended trading.", "description": "FedEx Corp warned on Tuesday that full-year earnings would miss analysts' estimates, as the U.S.-China trade war exacerbates a global economic cooling and the company manages fallout from its split with customer-turned-competitor Amazon.com Inc .", "authors": ["Lisa Baertlein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430972317&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1RQ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
