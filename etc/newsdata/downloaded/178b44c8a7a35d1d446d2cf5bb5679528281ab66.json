I\u2019m in this fun moment where I\u2019m rediscovering myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs they grow up, I find my children are strong individuals but still open-minded,\u201d Jolie continued. \u201cI try to lead by example and be kind and gracious, as my mother was \u2014 and loving and tolerant. But when there\u2019s a fight that needs to be had, get in there. We need to prepare the next generation because there\u2019s so much happening in the world \u2014 they\u2019re up against it.\u201d\n\nJames Devaney/Getty Images More\n\nAngelina Jolie and her kids | Monica Schipper/Getty More\n\nRELATED: Angelina Jolie Says Her Kids Are \u201cHappy\u201d She\u2019s in a Marvel Movie: \u201cThey Want to See Me Strong\u201d\n\nAnd her children still always prioritize their mother, even as they grow older.
