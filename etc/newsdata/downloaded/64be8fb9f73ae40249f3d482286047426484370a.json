He said:\n\nIn the case of the key and very beneficial nuclear science \u2026 when it was paired with a thirst for more power, it resulted in the creation of the nuclear weapon and turned into a major threat to the world and humanity. Although we have always had the ability to tread this path, we declared it haram [forbidden by religion] according to the verdict of the beloved Islam, and therefore there is no reason for us to expend our resources on developing and stockpiling a weapon that is absolutely prohibited [by Islam] to use.\n\nIran vehemently denies having ever sought an atomic bomb and says its nuclear program is for peaceful energy production and medical purposes only.\n\nIn May last year, President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from an Obama-negotiated 2015 deal that gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program.\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the product of protracted negotiations led by then-Secretary of State John Kerry, was widely viewed as the Obama administration\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement.\n\nWithdrawal from the same was a Donald Trump campaign promise.\n\nAnd we\u2019re out. Another promise fulfilled \u2714\ufe0f \u201cWhen I make promises I keep them\u201d @realDonaldTrump \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) May 8, 2018\n\nKhamenei said last week that Tehran will continue abandoning commitments to the deal as long as the U.S. keeps hitting Iran with sanctions.\n\nKhamenei also told the crowd of academics they should focus on their religion and nationality while rejecting any notion of copying the U.S. in any manner.\n\n\u201cWe want science but we don\u2019t want our universities to be a reproduction of some U.S. university,\u201d Khamenei said.\n\nHe hailed Iranian achievements in medical science, engineering, nanotechnology and peaceful nuclear energy.\n\n\u201cWe live in a different situation than others,\u201d Khamenei said. \u201cWe need to think Iranian, act Iranian and live Iranian and this trend can be accelerated by adopting the Islamic-Iranian Blueprint for Progress.\u201d\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe path we are taking is neither one of socialism, nor of liberal democracy. We have suggested a third path to save nations from the decadent Western culture.\u201d\n\nAlthough Khamenei works hard to build the case for a peace-loving Iran that would never embrace nuclear weapons, his words directly contradict what he said previously.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, there is a letter from Khameini that calls for the development of nuclear weapons. Regardless of what Khamenei says, in Iran, it is still Khameini\u2019s order that is deemed supreme.\n\nThe letter was written by Khameini in 1988 and released by former President Hashemi Rafsanjani 18 years later, in September of 2006.\n\nThe missive is at direct odds with Tehran and the Obama administration\u2019s statements Iran is not seeking a nuclear bomb because it goes against Islam.\n\nIn his \u201988 letter, Khameini called for the Islamic Republic to have \u201cthe ability to make a substantial number of laser and atomic weapons which will be the necessity of the war at that time.\u201d A link to the translation of the original letter was published by the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn closing his letter, Khameini wrote, \u201cBe aware of God and whatever happens, it is His decision. Peace be upon pious people.
