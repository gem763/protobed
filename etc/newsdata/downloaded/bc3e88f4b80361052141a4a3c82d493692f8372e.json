Only NGINX servers with PHP-FPM enabled are vulnerable. PHP-FPM, or FastCGI Process Manager, is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation with some additional features.\n\nHowever, while PHP-FPM is not a standard component of Nginx installs, some web hosting providers include it as part of their standard PHP hosting environments.\n\nOne such case is web hosting provider Nextcloud, who issued a security advisory to its clients on Thursday, October 24, urging customers to update PHP to the latest release, versions 7.3.11 and 7.2.24, which had been released on the same day and included fixes for CVE-2019-11043. Many other web hosting providers are also suspected of running the vulnerable Nginx+PHP-FPM combo.\n\nBut there are also website owners who cannot update PHP or can't switch from PHP-FPM to another CGI processor due to technical constraints.\n\nThis blog post from Wallarm, the company that found the PHP7 RCE, includes instructions on how webmasters can use the standard mod_security firewall utility to block %0a (newline) bytes in website URLs, and prevent any incoming attacks.\n\nWallarm credited its security researcher Andrew Danau for discovering the bug during a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition last month.\n\nDue to the availability of public PoC code and the simplicity of exploiting this bug, website owners are advised to check server settings and update PHP as soon as possible if they run the vulnerable configuration.", "description": "New PHP7 bug CVE-2019-11043 can allow even non-technical attackers to take over servers.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/14/8cb090a5-da9d-47c8-b769-e1a9692a5c62/thumbnail/770x578/849c80cda3b52bf3fbbaec0c39f0c8db/php.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
