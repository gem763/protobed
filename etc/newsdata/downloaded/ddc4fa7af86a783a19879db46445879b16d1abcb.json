Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) and Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.).\n\n9 questions about the Trump whistleblower complaint, answered\n\nLegal protections for government employees seeking to report wrongdoing date back more than 240 years to the Continental Congress, and they\u2019ve been rewritten many times since. But these reforms still don\u2019t go far enough to protect an employee\u2019s right, said David Colapinto, general counsel at the nonprofit National Whistleblower Center.\n\nToday, the Whistleblower Protection Act and the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act are the primary statutes outlining officials\u2019 rights to speak out about misconduct.\n\nAll government employees can safely disclose violations of laws or regulations, waste or mismanagement, abuse of authority and dangers to public health and safety, but how you can report that differs based on where you work.\n\nIf you work in the intelligence community, where the information at hand is usually sensitive or secret, your rights are more limited, Colapinto said. You can blow the whistle up the chain of command and to your agency\u2019s inspector general, but you\u2019re rarely permitted to go beyond that.\n\nThe only exception is if an official lodges a complaint and the Intelligence Community Inspector General determines it\u2019s credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of \u201curgent concern\u201d \u2014 which happened with the grievance about Trump\u2019s communication with a foreign leader believed to be the new president of Ukraine. That ruling is supposed to trigger notification of congressional oversight committees.\n\nBut in this case, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to share details about Trump\u2019s alleged transgression with lawmakers, a move Colapinto called unprecedented and said could further erode trust in the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cThe system of whistleblowing will fail in the intelligence community if that complaint is not transmitted to Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have a whistleblower complaint verified as credible and urgent and not end up where it\u2019s supposed to go would be the worst possible outcome. There would be a crisis in confidence in the intelligence community.\u201d\n\nBut regular civil service employees have more options, Zuckerman said.\n\nThey can report wrongdoing directly to congressional oversight committees and to the news media \u2014 as long as they\u2019re not leaking classified documents \u2014 in addition to blowing the whistle within their own agency, to their inspector general or to the Office of Special Counsel.\n\nRepublicans echo Trump in suggesting whistleblower complaint is politically motivated\n\nIn the case of the complaint against Trump, outrage has fallen along party lines, but protections for whistleblowers have traditionally received bipartisan support. Even so, retaliation for reports of wrongdoing remains common. In a 2010 government survey, more than a third of respondents who were identified as the source of a complaint said they faced threats or acts of reprisal \u2014 or both.\n\nOne reason for this lingering problem is the Merit Systems Protection Board, said Mandy Smithberger, director of the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight\u2019s Center for Defense Information. The agency adjudicates alleged reprisals against whistleblowers, but the Senate has yet to fill its three seats. It\u2019s been empty for a half-year, and its backlog of cases is piling up.\n\nBut even when it was handling disputes, it rarely sided with whistleblowers, Smithberger said, and intelligence officials don\u2019t have access to the court. Advocates have instead pushed for jury trials, which they say will lead to more equitable and just verdicts.\n\nInstead of relying on a legal framework for protection against retaliation, Smithberger said potential whistleblowers should proceed carefully: Gather as much documentation as possible, consult a lawyer and try to stay anonymous.\n\n\u201cOne has to go in with the assumption that it\u2019s career suicide,\u201d she said. \u201cTalk to your family before you blow the whistle because you\u2019re making a big decision you can\u2019t take back. You\u2019re doing it at a great personal risk.\u201d\n\nSmithberger\u2019s organization even offers an online manual, \u201cCaught Between Conscience and Career: Expose abuse without exposing your identity.\u201d (\u201cIf you are a government whistleblower,\u201d she advised, \u201cI would recommend you don\u2019t download it from your government computer.\u201d)\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric is dangerous, she said, but the climate for whistleblowers is already one of intense fear.\n\n\u201cI think it will have a chilling effect,\u201d Smithberger said, \u201cbut it\u2019s already Siberia.\u201d\n\nHowever, the legal and political dispute does provide lawmakers an opportunity to change that \u2014 to show whistleblowers that their complaints are valued.\n\n\u201cThis is really a moment when the spotlight is on Congress to show government employees they\u2019re going to take their concerns seriously and act on them responsibly, and not just play politics,\u201d Smithberger added. \u201cIf this person gets fired, are they going to fight to get them reinstated when this story isn\u2019t on the front page anymore?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nWhistleblower complaint about President Trump involves Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter\n\nHow Trump and Giuliani pressured Ukraine to investigate the president\u2019s rivals\n\nCongress doesn\u2019t have a lot of options to get this whistleblower complaint", "description": "The White House's knee-jerk reaction casting the unnamed whistleblower as politically motivated may discourage others from coming forward.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-19-2019/t_7b06d76247024497881d5299bda0dc8c_name_c2ce8434_d8c9_11e9_a1a5_162b8a9c9ca2_1080.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
