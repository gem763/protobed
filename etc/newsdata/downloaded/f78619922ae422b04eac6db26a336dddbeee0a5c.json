By 3.30pm it was at $1.286.\n\nSebastien Clements, currency analyst at OFX, said: 'As has been the case with the UK for the past 18 months, nothing good lasts forever.\n\n'In this case, nothing good lasts for 24 hours. The Brexit agreement dream has been shattered by the DUP, after reports have surfaced claiming they are still unwilling to back Johnson and his EU divorce agreement.\n\n'As we know, the markets are extremely fickle at the best of times, and a great surge is typically accompanied by a minor retrace. However, this was more than a minor retrace as GBP/USD has moved from $1.27 at UK market open to $1.29 at midday.\n\nThis six-month graph shows how the pound has risen over the past week to a five-month high\n\n'For now, the pound has stabilised around $1.28 and it seems as though the extreme volatility from earlier has subdued. However, all it takes is a leak from Westminster to restart the market chaos.'\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce warned there was 'still a long way to go' before business could feel confident of a deal being struck.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson leaves the back of Downing St today on his way to Brussels\n\nThe comments come as businesses have been forced to shelve investment plans amid the Brexit uncertainty, which has taken its toll on the UK economy.\n\nThe falls came after the Democratic Unionist Party said it would not support the deal in its current form.\n\nAnalysts have revised up expectations of Brexit happening at the end of this month while traders have cut back their short positions on the British currency.\n\nArtur Baluszynski, head of research at Henderson Rowe, said: 'Big win for Boris. If he manages to get it through Parliament, we should see a wave of 'risk-on' trades coming into UK market.\n\n'However, let us wait and see all the details and then let the markets decide how likely it is for the UK parliament to accept it. For now, expect some positive momentum in sterling and domestically focused asset classes.'\n\nMichael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton, added: 'Sterling has gained over 1 per cent this morning on news that the UK and EU have reached a deal on Brexit.\n\n'However, some of the wind has been taken out of the pound's sails after reports that the DUP are not yet onboard to back a deal. Therefore, the Parliamentary arithmetic for passing a deal looks challenging.\n\n'Attention will continue to focus on whether the new agreement will pass in the Commons on Saturday, while sterling traders will continue to pay close attention to developing headlines from this afternoon's EU summit.'\n\nAnti-Brexit demonstrators continue to protest outside the Houses of Parliament this morning\n\nThe announcement by Mr Johnson followed days of intense negotiations, but he is expected to face a tough task getting the agreement through Parliament.\n\nWith the Commons expected to sit on Saturday to discuss it - the first weekend session for 37 years - the DUP insisted it still could not yet back the Government's Brexit plans.\n\nThe stance of the DUP is important because the party wields influence over some Tory Brexiteers.\n\nIn Mr Johnson's announcement today, he tweeted: 'We've got a great new deal that takes back control.\n\n'Now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.'\n\nEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted: 'Where there is a will, there is a deal - we have one!\n\n'It's a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that EUCO endorses this deal.'", "description": "Sterling rose above $1.29 this morning which marked a five-month high, but it later plunged when it dawned on investors that there was no guarantee of the UK Parliament backing the Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19842632-0-image-a-46_1571322991136.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
