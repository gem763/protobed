But then he promised to wait for Saudi Arabia to tell him \u201cunder what terms we would proceed.\u201d\n\nHis message on Twitter offered a remarkable insight into the deference Mr. Trump gives to the Saudi royal family and touched off a torrent of criticism from those who have long accused him of doing Riyadh\u2019s bidding while sweeping Saudi violations of human rights and international norms under the rug.\n\nIt was hard to imagine him allowing NATO, or a European ally, such latitude to determine how the United States should respond. But for Mr. Trump, the Saudis have always been a special case, their economic import having often overwhelmed other considerations in his mind.\n\nWhether, and how, to commit forces is one of the most critical decisions any American president can make, but Mr. Trump\u2019s comment gave the impression that he was outsourcing the decision.", "description": "After oil installations were blown up, President Trump seemed to suggest he was ready to strike back.
