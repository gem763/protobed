Take the beautiful silver Saint Laurent bowling bag I was too scared to use in case I scratched its perfect metallic surface. Or the far too grown-up Prada deerskin tote I thought would make me feel like I had my shit together but that I lived in fear might get soaked in a sudden London downpour.\n\nIt turned out that I was not someone who could own a bag that just looked nice \u2014 I needed one that I could wear without having heart palpitations every time someone brushed past me on the tube. I needed the kind of bag busy women have been relying on for decades. I needed a Prada Vela backpack.\n\nA quick history lesson: In 1984, Miuccia Prada (who had pivoted from feminist organiser within the Italian Communist Party to working at her family\u2019s leather-goods company) created a black, leather-trimmed nylon backpack. Unadorned with logos \u2014 save a small triangular nameplate \u2014 the bag was the antithesis of \u201980s excess but prophesied the sporty minimalism of the coming decade. By 1990, adopted by both editors watching shows in Paris and busy young New Yorkers (as photographed by Bill Cunningham), Prada\u2019s first \u2018It\u2019 bag had been well and truly born, ushering in a new era for the house and setting it on a path towards megabrandom.\n\nAlmost 40 years later, and the Prada backpack\u2019s cult status shows no sign of dimming \u2014 it\u2019s been immortalised in teen movies (\u201cI like my Skechers, but I love my Prada backpack\u201d, 10 Things I Hate About You) and institutions (it was featured in MoMA\u2019s \u2018Is Fashion Modern?\u2019 exhibition in 2017). As of today, there are over 27,000 posts on Instagram tagged #pradabackpack.\n\nPrada\u2019s nylon \u2014 which the brand has recently committed to making more sustainable \u2014 is made of industrial-grade fabric used for army tents, meaning I can blithely hurl my backpack onto airport conveyors, stuff it with gym clothes, and wear it in the rain like it\u2019s no big deal. The classic size is deceptively spacious (easily accommodating a small laptop, book, pair of Birkenstocks), and when it gets dirty, I simply wipe the surface, occasionally sticking a hoover in to suck out whatever has gathered in the lining.\n\nThey retail for between \u00a3820 and \u00a31,220, which, I know, feels like kind of an obscene amount to spend on a backpack. If your budget doesn\u2019t stretch, consider looking to Herschel. To me, though, you can\u2019t beat Prada. These bags can last decades \u2014 check out Vestiaire Collective (where you can swipe a vintage or used bag for considerably less than the RRP) for proof.\n\nPrada Nylon Backpack Vestiaire Collective are offering Strategist UK readers \u00a315 off \u00a3120 with the code: StratUK19. \u00a3744 at Vestiaire Collective Buy with code: StratUK19\n\nThe Strategist UK is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape.
