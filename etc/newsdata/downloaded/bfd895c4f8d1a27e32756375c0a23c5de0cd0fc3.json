Other groups also joined to form the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., which claimed control over the land it liberated from ISIS.\n\nSince then, a small contingent of American troops, now numbering about 1,000, have backed the S.D.F. in holding the area.", "description": "Analysts said the redeployment would betray America\u2019s Syrian Kurdish allies, decrease American leverage in Syria and open a void that could benefit Iran, Russia and the Islamic State.", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/07/world/07syria/07syria-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
