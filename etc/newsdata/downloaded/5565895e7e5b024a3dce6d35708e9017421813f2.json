Building a new factory in the district, with a capacity to manufacture 200,000 vehicles a year, would be part of the deal, the report said.\n\nAccording to 36Kr.com, as translated by Google Translate, Nio Chief Executive Bin Li said Tuesday there was not much to disclose, but that Weilai, the Chinese name for Nio that means Blue Sky Coming, was in contact with many local governments.\n\nThe reports helped send the stock NIO, -5.81% up 1.3% on Tuesday.\n\nBut on Wednesday, NBD reported that the talks had been called off, given the \u201cheavy risks,\u201d with no agreement of intent having been reached.\n\nThat sent the stock tumbling 8.1% in afternoon trading toward the second-lowest ever close, only above the record closing low of $1.32 on Oct. 1.\n\nNio\u2019s stock has now plunged 78% year to date, while U.S.-based rival Tesla Inc. shares TSLA, +0.72% have shed 23% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.20% has climbed 19%.\n\nAlso read: Nio shares gain after delivery numbers top outlook.\n\nSee related: Nio\u2019s stock slips in volatile trading after Goldman cuts rating, slashes price target by 85%.\n\nThe selloff has brought the stock down into a key support zone on the charts, forged by a textbook, technical reversal pattern known to candlestick chart watchers as a \u201cbullish engulfing.\u201d\n\nThe bullish engulfing is a two-day pattern, in which a stock falls from the opening price to a record low close on the first day. On the second day, the stock opens below the first-day\u2019s closing price, then rallies to close above the previous session\u2019s opening price.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: 7 key candlestick reversal patterns.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nThe idea is that the pattern depicts a situation in which bears hit bulls with their best shot, and bulls survived to launch a successful counterattack that helped swing momentum to the upside.\n\nOpening below the previous day\u2019s intraday low, then closing above the previous intraday high suggests an even stronger counterattack.\n\nAccording to candlestick charting guru Steve Nison, founder and chief executive of Candlecharts.com, support provided by the bullish engulfing remains intact until the stock closes below the lower boundary of the pattern, which for Nio\u2019s stock is $1.19. Read more about Steve Nison.\n\nWhile that still allows for a 17% drop from current levels, key resistance starts about 57% higher, for a risk-versus-reward ratio of about 3.4-to-1.\n\nKey resistance should start at the big gap in the chart created by the 20% plunge on Sept. 24, in which the intraday high of $2.24 is well below the Sept. 23 intraday low of $2.71. That fact this gap took the stock below previous support at the June 14 and June 17 identical intraday lows of $2.35, made it a \u201cbreakaway gap,\u201d or break-down gap, which increased its bearish message to some chart watchers.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nThe idea of gap resistance is that those who bought Nio above the gap, and were left stunned by the gap down, would likely be happy to abandon those positions as the stock price approaches the break-down point.\n\nThe same goes for why previous support, once surpassed, morphs into resistance. Nison calls this phenomenon a \u201cchange of polarity,\u201d as those who had bought as the stock declined, then watch the stock keep falling to new lows, may be happy to get out at breakeven. Read more about change of polarity.\n\nThe change also reflects that bears are likely willing to fight to maintain their new position of dominance.\n\nThat resistance area starts at the stop of the gap and the June lows, or 57% to 64% above current levels.", "description": "Shares of Nio Inc. dropped more than 8% Wednesday, after a report that discussions over a potential large new funding deal had been halted, with investors...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT434_Nio_10_ZG_20191016144416.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
