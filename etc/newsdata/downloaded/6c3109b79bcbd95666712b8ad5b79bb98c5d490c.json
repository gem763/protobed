Rebekah Vardy's account\" statement as she tweeted about her husband.\n\nAfter he scored a hat-trick for his team Leicester City, she tweeted: \"It's...... Jamie Vardy #9\"\n\nNow, she's taken to her Instagram story to share a post about mental health.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nIt said: \"For anyone that is struggling...\n\n\"It's okay to feel unstable. It's okay to dissociate. It's okay to hide from the world. It's okay to need help.\n\n\"It's okay not to be okay. Your mental illness is not a personal failure.\"\n\nColeen, who has been nicknamed Wagatha Christie in the scandal, planted false stories on her private Instagram account and revealed in an epic statement that she'd blocked every account but Rebekah's from viewing her Stories to test whether or not the information would leak.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAnd when they did, she told the world what had happened in a bombshell statement that went viral.\n\nRebekah has vehemently denied leaking stories about Coleen and said in her own statement that it was \"disgusting\" that she even had to deny it, especially when she's heavily pregnant.\n\nShe was so upset that she cut her Dubai holiday short and flew back home.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBecky claimed she has hired a forensic IT expert to prove her innocence and is considering legal action.\n\nBut representatives for Coleen say she has irrefutable evidence that the leaks came from Rebekah's account.\n\n* Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.
