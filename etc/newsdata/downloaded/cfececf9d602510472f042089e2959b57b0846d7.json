Since Thursday, the Chicago Public School District, the third-largest school district in the nation, has been forced to cancel classes for more than 300,000 kids, sidelining their education and sending parents into a scramble to cover the unexpected home time.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration has indicated both sides are far from ratifying a contract.\n\nIn a contract proposal that the union rejected, the mayor offered a 16 percent pay raise over five years. But the CTU demands a 15 percent raise over three years.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t bargain with ourselves,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters last week.\n\nPicketing teachers told reporters last week that the walkout was about getting more resources for students, and not about getting a raise.\n\nBut, despite the fact that Illinois law prohibits union strikes over \u201cnon-economic\u201d issues, those are also sticking points in negotiations: class-size and a demand that the school district agree to hire more support staff like nurses, social workers and librarians.\n\nAs the Chicago Tribune reported, Mayor Lightfoot already agreed to \u201cspend $3 million to reduce class sizes in fourth through 12th grade classrooms. And, the city has offered to double the number of social workers and nurses.\u201d\n\nBut the real question is whether the taxpayers of Chicago can even afford such lavish concessions from the mayor. They\u2019re already paying quite a bit in taxes.\n\nAn Illinois Policy Institute analysis of 24 different taxes and fees finds that Chicago ranked No. 1 on 10 of the tax and fee rates. Of those 24 different taxes, Chicago ranked no lower than No. 14 in any category, ranking No. 1 in sales tax rates, No. 6 in property tax and No. 9 in gas tax.\n\nCompounding the problem, the state of Illinois fails at spending education funds effectively. On average, Illinois school districts spent $20,826 per student for 2016-17, according to the Illinois State Board of Education.\n\nOther large school districts spend considerably less. For example, according to 2017 Census data, Fairfax County, Virginia -- the 13th largest school system in the U.S., according to World Atlas -- only spends $14,498 per student and Montgomery County, Maryland -- the 14th largest school system in the U.S. -- spends $16,109 per pupil.\n\nInstead of just adding to the tab via teacher raises and new hires, Illinois and the City of Chicago need to examine how they spend tax dollars and reallocate more resources to actually educating students.\n\nAnd Illinois leads the nation in school administration spending, at more than $1 billion, a report from the Metropolitan Planning Council finds. Instead of just adding to the tab via teacher raises and new hires, Illinois and the City of Chicago need to examine how they spend tax dollars and reallocate more resources to actually educating students.\n\nThe public conversation and debate should focus more on what contract provisions solely benefit the union versus what benefits teachers and students.\n\nFor example, part of the mayor\u2019s contract offer would require the Chicago Board of Education to provide the union with all current employees\u2019 private information.\n\nThe list is exhaustive, including employees\u2019 name, job title, department, work location, home address, all telephone numbers, personal and work email, salary, date of birth, identification number, status as a member or non-union member and whether they pay union dues and payments to the union\u2019s political arm. Worse, workers have no right to opt out of that information sharing.\n\nCTU obviously demands this information so it can know which employees are full-fledged union members or not, and then use the non-members personal information to press them into joining the union and paying dues. Information on teachers who are non-members is of the utmost importance to government unions now that the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that non-union members can no longer be forced to pay dues as a condition of employment.\n\nUnion demands with respect to class size should also get more scrutiny. One contract provision grants all CTU delegates \u2014 a variety of teachers, nurses and other Chicago public school employees \u2014 a free period every month to conduct union business paid by the taxpayer. On the CTU website, it appears there is upwards of 800 such delegates.\n\nIn addition, teachers and other employees elected to senior positions at the CTU can be granted \u201cleaves of absence for union business\u201d for the school year. Chicago public schools do not pay their salaries while on union business leave, but there\u2019s a real taxpayer cost: those workers continue to accrue seniority, health and pension benefits, and may return to their original public employment after their term.\n\nNeedless to say, taxpayers should not be on the hook for public employees conducting union business. As the city of Chicago and the CTU continue to negotiate, hopefully someone from the city calls for scrapping provisions that endanger workers\u2019 privacy and exclusively benefit the union.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAfter all, labor unions are formed to promote the interests of their members, not agree to contracts that serve the interests of its leaders.\n\nTrey Kovacs is a labor policy analyst for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free market public policy organization based in Washington, D.C.", "description": "As the city of Chicago and the CTU continue to negotiate, hopefully someone from the city calls for scrapping provisions that endanger workers\u2019 privacy and exclusively benefit the union.", "authors": ["Trey Kovacs"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/chicago-teacher-strike-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
