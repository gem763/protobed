At least 2,000 of those items were toys and medications that did not include warnings about health risks to children.\n\nThe items were listed by the millions of third-party sellers that flock to Amazon\u2019s site. In 2018, 2.5 million merchants sold items on Amazon, according to Marketplace Pulse.\n\n\u201cWhen you shop on Amazon, you are looking at millions of products that are being sourced by hundreds of thousands of either sellers or things of that nature,\u201d D.A. Davidson senior analyst Tom Forte told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move. \u201cSo the way I think about it is buyer beware.\u201d\n\nIn legal disputes, Amazon argues that it is not the seller and therefore cannot be responsible for any liabilities from third-party sellers. In response to the WSJ report, Amazon said it invested more than $400 million just last year to \u201cto ensure products offered are safe, compliant, and authentic.\u201d\n\nForte argues that policing the site has been a struggle for Amazon from the beginning.\n\nView of the Amazon homepage (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cAmazon never had control of its business,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of the structural challenge for Amazon and offering a product and not probably policing them as carefully as possible on an individual basis is that you don't have control \u2014 it's difficult to monitor such a large ecosystem but with so many products. \u201d\n\nA lucrative business for Amazon\n\nThe company\u2019s third-party sellers business dates back to 1999 and has been lucrative and profitable for the company. In 2018 alone, Amazon made $42.7 billion from fees that third-party sellers pay to reach their customers.\n\n\u201cThe upside for Amazon is it offers consumers millions of products,\u201d Forte said. \u201cThe downside is a small portion of this product are not great product. \u201c\n\nAmazon responded to the investigation by taking down 83% of the products that the WSJ identified as unsafe or banned.\n\n\u201cI do think to that point, if you look at what's happening on a global basis for the four big horsemen of \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google \u2014 you're seeing governments looking at it and saying, do these companies have too much influence on consumers?\u201d Forte added. \u201cAnd are they perhaps in some instances, abusing this influence.\u201d\n\nValentina Caval is a producer for Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "A senior analyst says Amazon never had control of its online retail business.", "authors": ["Valentina Caval"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9BKzpaAji96IwmdpOAiong--~B/aD0zMzkwO3c9NTYwNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/df78b990-c8a9-11e9-8bb9-eed9c171512b", "published_at": "2019-08-27"}
