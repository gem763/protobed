It still hasn\u2019t sunk in,\u201d Betts said in his first visit to Ikon Park as a Blue.\n\n\u201cI knew we were talking about it for a little while, but for it to finally happen \u2026 I\u2019m really emotional walking back onto this ground. I almost started crying.\u201d\n\nBetts said it was also a big wrench to leave his Adelaide teammates and the Crows\u2019 fans.\n\nBut his return to Carlton will complete the circle on his journey that started in 2005.\n\nSigning a one year deal, Betts also reportedly turned down a three-year deal from the Gold Coast Suns to return to the Blues.\n\nBetts joined the Crows in 2014 and had six packed seasons at Adelaide.\n\nHe noted the Crows had been through a lot in his time there, with the death of coach Phil Walsh and their tumultuous 2017 grand-final loss to Richmond.\n\n\u201cThe emotions are still running through my system. The love and support I\u2019ve been shown by Adelaide and the players, in particular \u2014 we\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still really connected to those players and we\u2019re going to be friends for life.\n\n\u201cJust speaking about it now is making me emotional, because we were so tight- knit and to leave that group is really sad.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Trade Radio, former Port Adelaide star Kane Cornes said Betts is \u201ca sporting god in Adelaide\u201d and compare the impact he\u2019d had on the Crows to Tony Modra.\n\n.@kanecornes: \"I\u2019m not sure since Tony Modra there\u2019s been a player that has had as big an impact on Adelaide as Eddie Betts.\n\n\n\n\"He is a sporting god in Adelaide.\"\n\n\n\nThe Late Trade, for AEG PowerTools#AFLTrade pic.twitter.com/4PuabvueLw \u2014 Telstra AFL Trade Radio (@traderadio) October 14, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a feeling that many people shared.\n\nIf Eddie Betts ends up playing a game against @Adelaide_FC, you can absolutely guarantee there will not be a single boo in the stadium. He might actually be the first former player to ever be cheered by his old club for getting a possession against them. \u2014 Adam Liaw (@adamliaw) October 14, 2019\n\nYou brought more to this club than you will ever know. You are an inspiration, the ultimate role model and just a ripping bloke. Thank you Eddie for donning the \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc99 Good luck at the Blues @CarltonFC, love ya bro. #weflyasone pic.twitter.com/7P3jOkA3zS \u2014 Ryan Fitzgerald (@FitzySA) October 14, 2019\n\nEddie Betts is the most exciting thing to happen to Carlton since everyone woofed when Ang Christou kicked the ball \u2014 Darren Levin (@darren_levin) October 14, 2019\n\nI\u2019m really happy Betts is back.\n\nReally happy. \u2014 Tegan Higginbotham (@TeganMH) October 14, 2019\n\nEddie Betts will finish his career at Carlton. Carlton have been good at finishing people\u2019s careers. \u2014 Titus O'Reily (@TitusOReily) October 14, 2019\n\nBut the most emotional tribute was from former skipper Taylor Walker, who said \u201c\u2018good things do come to an end\u2019 BUT our friendship will last forever\u201d.\n\nCrows general manager of list management and strategy Justin Reid also gave Betts a fitting send off in a statement on the Adelaide website.\n\n\u201cHe has given our Members and supporters so much to cheer about and produced some moments of absolute brilliance and no one will ever forget \u2018Eddie\u2019s Pocket\u2019 at Adelaide Oval,\u201d Reid said.\n\n\u201cEddie has been such an important part of our forward line in recent years, and has consistently hit the scoreboard and brought teammates into the game with a selfless approach.\n\n\u201cHe has also opened up his home and helped encourage and guide the next generation of indigenous players, while his work in the wider community has ensured he is a role model for all ages.\n\n\u201cEddie, Anna and their children Lewis, Billy, Alice and Maggie will always be part of the Crows family and we wish them the very best with their move back to Victoria and for the years ahead.\u201d\n\nThe freakish small forward, a three-time All Australian, has kicked 600 goals and has won the goal-of-the-year award four times.\n\nNew Carlton coach David Teague was an assistant at Adelaide and Betts said he played his best football when Teague was in charge of the forward line.\n\nHe added Teague was a \u201creally big pull\u201d for the return to the Blues and that he still had plenty to show as a player.\n\n\u201cMy leadership really stood up when I was over there and I believe I can still play some good footy \u2026 I believe I still have a lot to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy body is fine \u2014 I will play until my body says I can\u2019t play any more. I have no injuries \u2026 my agility is there; my speed is there.\n\n\u201cSo it will be exciting \u2014 a different game plan, a different style.\u201d\n\n\u2014 with AAP", "description": "It\u2019s finally happened \u2014 Eddie Betts is going home.", "authors": ["Andrew Mcmurtry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6cb2ecf8f2dc66563b074e4163e93879?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
