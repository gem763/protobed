I\u2019ve just loved this whole thing.'\n\nSmile: Lady Emma Weymouth, 33, and Aljaz Skorjanec, 29, will Jive to Kids In America by Kim Wilde\n\nSensational: Presenter Karim Zeroual, 25, and Amy Dowden, 28, will perform the Tango to Paradise by George Ezra\n\n'I\u2019ve not one negative about the whole experience,' she continued as she stood beside her dance partner. 'We\u2019ve worked really hard, I\u2019m covered in bruises.'\n\nFurther acknowledging Kevin, she said: 'I love this man; it\u2019s been a joy to have that honour, that privilege of learning to dance. It\u2019s a whole new world to me, Tess. I love all that gang up there! Now I\u2019ve got 11 and a half [dance] moves!\n\n'My son is getting married next year, I\u2019m determined to be able to shuffle onto the dance floor and not do my usual thing of handing out the canapes.'\n\nKevin had equally glowing words for the TV star. as he told her: 'You\u2019ve put in so much commitment and so much effort.\n\nDance: Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley, 36, and Johannes Radebe, 32, will perform the Charleston to Single Ladies by Beyonce\n\nWow: Michelle Visage, 51, and Giovanni Pernice will be dancing the Salsa to Quimbara by Johnny Pacheco and Celia Cruz\n\n'We worked about four hours on one step on that Charleston and you delivered that waltz last week\u2026 then to come out and deliver that Charleston - the improvement you\u2019ve made, I\u2019m so proud of you, it\u2019s been an absolute joy.'\n\nThe pair's early exit was particularly notable, as Kevin is currently Strictly's reigning champ, having secured the coveted Glitterball with his now-girlfriend Stacey Dooley.\n\nThis weekend, the stars competing on Strictly were tasked with giving their best Hollywood-inspired performances as they rook to the dancefloor for Movie Week.\n\nHowever, Anneka and David found themselves facing off on the dancefloor during Sunday's episode, after failing to overly impress judges and placing at the bottom of the leaderboard with scores of 11 and 16, respectively.\n\nDance dance: Actress Emma Barton, 42, and Anton Du Beke, 53, will dance the Viennese Waltz to Send In The Clowns by Barbra Streisand\n\nNext performance: Chris Ramsey, 33, and Karen Clifton, 36, performing the jive to Saturday Night\u2019s Alright (For Fighting) by Taron Egerton\n\nComeback: Last week's dance-off survivors, sportsman David James , 49, and Nadiya Bychkova, 30, will do the Quickstep to From Now On by Hugh Jackman\n\nTheir scores from judges Shirley Ballas, Motsi Mabuse, Bruno Tonioli, and Craig Revel Horwood were combined with the viewers' votes to decide the bottom two.\n\nWith both couples required to perform their routines again, Anneka and Kevin hit the dancefloor once again for their Charleston to Woo Hoo by The 5.6.7.8\u2019s from the Quentin Tarantino movie Kill Bill.\n\nDavid and Nadiya performed their American Smooth to Kiss From A Rose by Seal, taken from the movie Batman Forever, in a bid to remain in the competition.\n\nHowever, Anneka's efforts in the ballroom proved futile as she was sent home with a unanimous vote\n\nReigining supreme at the top of the leaderboard once again was actor Kelvin Fletcher and partner Oti Mabuse, who clocked up an impressive 38 points with their Charleston routine to Trip A Little Light Fantastic from Mary Poppins Returns.", "description": "The dances for week four of Strictly Come Dancing have been revealed.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/16/19450160-0-image-a-14_1570550112047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
