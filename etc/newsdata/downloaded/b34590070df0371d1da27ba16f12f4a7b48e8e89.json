Shoppers lined up for hours to get into the store upon opening, ducking under the roller door as it inched up from the ground.\n\nThey fought over Birkin bags and Moutai liquor. They wrestled for detergent and grabbed at a piece of pork with their bare hands, even as the butcher was trying to cut it. There was a three-hour wait for a space in the parking lot \u2014 and sometimes longer in checkout lines.\n\nBy the afternoon, the discount retail store was in such chaos that it had to close early. \u201cPlease don\u2019t come,\u201d Costco said in an alert sent to members, who paid $28 to join for a year.\n\n\n\nPeople try to get a roast chicken at the first Costco outlet in China on the store\u2019s opening day.

(Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nEven for veterans of Black Friday in the United States, the scenes would have been extraordinary.\n\nBeyond the chaos, they illustrated an important political point. The Chinese and American economies are inextricably intertwined. Chinese shoppers want American products, especially at bargain prices, and American companies want Chinese shoppers.\n\nPresident Trump a week ago ordered \u2014 without the authority or the ability to do so \u2014 American companies to leave China.\n\nChinese state media outlets responded by gleefully pointing out some of the big-name American companies, including Costco, that are doing just the opposite.\n\nThe Global Times, a nationalist newspaper that often reflects the foreign policy thinking of the ruling Communist Party, noted that Starbucks and Walmart were expanding, Tesla was set to produce Model 3 cars at its Shanghai factory by the end of the year, and the local head of Coca-Cola said it \u201cmust not give up\u201d on China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one beautiful daydream of U.S. President Donald Trump that U.S. companies will give up China,\u201d Liang Ming, a research fellow of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the paper.\n\n\n\nCrowds of shoppers wait to enter the first Costco outlet in China on its opening day. By the afternoon, the store was in such chaos that it had to close early. \u201cPlease don\u2019t come,\u201d Costco said in an alert sent to members. (Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIf the American retail landscape has created winners and losers, the rifts are even more stark between companies that make it in China \u2014 and those that don\u2019t.\n\nHome Depot closed its last stores in 2012. Best Buy bought a majority stake in a Chinese electronics chain in 2006 and then withdrew from China altogether eight years later.\n\nWalmart has been in China since 1996 and made steady progress through brick-and-mortar stores and a partnership with the Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com\n\nRetail analysts pointed to Costco as a retail darling that has bested the competition, when it comes to international expansion, as a result of the company\u2019s measured and thoughtful approach to every country it enters \u2014 and the long-game it plays before officially opening a new store.\n\n[Will millennials kill Costco?]\n\nFive years ago, Costco partnered with Alibaba \u2014 China\u2019s dominant e-commerce platform \u2014 which helped the big-box store gain legitimacy among Chinese shoppers, said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. And even after Alibaba gave Costco a platform, Costco took its time, he said, waiting years to prepare for its \u201cgrand opening day, where thousands of people showed up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve built a link \u2014 a very powerful link \u2014 between who they are and what they do, and Chinese consumers who gleefully signed up as subscribers and showed up,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nIn a statement, Costco said that when its doors opened in Shanghai, the store \u201cencountered a record-breaking volume of members who wanted to shop with us. We are working closely with local authorities to control traffic flows, and provide smooth transitions to and from our new warehouse.\u201d\n\n\n\nA woman uses her cellphone while visiting the first Costco outlet in China.

It has 100 locations in Canada, 39 in Mexico, 29 in the United Kingdom, plus a slew in Taiwan, Japan, Australia and elsewhere. The company has 163,000 full- and part-time employees in the United States and 243,000 worldwide.\n\nBut that success isn\u2019t enough to secure a Chinese audience, experts say. Walmart, for example, learned that its model wasn\u2019t replicable everywhere when it had to pull out of Germany 13 years ago. For Costco to maintain such high interest in China, it will have to tailor its selection specifically for this new market.\n\n\u201cTarget went to Canada, and it didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Moody\u2019s Vice President Charlie O\u2019Shea. \u201cCanada is literally over the border. Going from the U.S. to China is not going from the U.S. to Canada. There are huge differences over there.\u201d\n\nUnlike retailers that are barely hanging on, O\u2019Shea said that Costco can afford to test a Chinese expansion. Growing slowly doesn\u2019t carry much risk, but there can be a huge payoff from \u201cthrowing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone in there and picked that site [in Shanghai] with a lot of thought, and look what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were mobbed. If anyone can make this a go in that market, it\u2019s Costco.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeople pack the first Costco outlet in China on its opening day in Shanghai.
