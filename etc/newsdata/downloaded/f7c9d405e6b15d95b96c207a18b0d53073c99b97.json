A chess board, a police constable\u2019s badge and a pile of colourful clothes. Ordinary, everyday things, mostly.\n\nBut to 16 people from more than a dozen countries around the world they have special significance, embodying what was lost \u2013 and in some cases what was found \u2013 in the baffling swirl of mental illness.\n\nWe are in the midst of a mental health crisis \u2013 advice about jogging and self-care is not enough | Suzanne Moore Read more\n\nThe Museum of Lost and Found Potential launches in London this week, marking World Mental Health Day with an exhibition that hopes to encourage empathy, action and even anger by showing what mental illness takes away \u2013 but also what can be retrieved if it is treated properly.\n\n\u201cI hope it will create some urgency,\u201d says Jazz Thornton, one of the subjects, a New Zealander who has tried to kill herself a dozen times. Thornton is represented by a tree branch that saved her life during one of those attempts \u2013 and by a note she wrote to her future self during recovery on a psychiatric ward, entitled Dear Suicidal Me.\n\n\u201cThese are tangible lives being lost,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cThis will put a face to the statistics.\u201d\n\nElisha London who, as chief executive of the group United for Global Mental Health, is the force behind the initiative, said: \u201cThis is the health issue that is killing our young people. Suicide is still illegal in 45 countries. Sierra Leone has one psychiatrist (for 7 million people).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cecilia Ashaley seeks solace in a pedicure when she is depressed.

We will take this to places where leaders are gathering, so that they touch it and feel it.\u201d\n\nThere is much to touch and feel in some more interactive pieces, realised by the artist Nestor Pestana. A ticker tape display with heartbreaking vignettes from Timiebi, a Nigerian woman; a reconstructed shack that was home to a Nepalese victim of human trafficking; a bank of speakers that relate the compelling stories of all participants. \u201cThe whole exhibition is about empathy,\u201d Pestana said.\n\nEncouragingly, some of the subjects appear well on the road to recovery or at least to some acceptance and accommodation of what has happened to them.\n\nDeeksha Chowdhury, a student from Delhi, endured years of bullying and torment because of her weight and a skin condition. A display of colourful garments represents her journey from an isolated teenager who always wore baggy black clothing to someone more self confident and outgoing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artefact at the Museum of Lost and Found Potential.

Cecilia Ashaley, a Ghanaian teacher, is represented by a wall of nail varnish in colours to mimic the west African sky, because whenever she is struggling, she seeks solace in a manicure or pedicure.\n\n\u201cIt represents me in my most depressed mood, when I think of things like killing myself,\u201d she said by telephone from Accra (she says the UK Home Office denied her a visa to attend the opening of the museum). \u201cI feel hopeless and not worth it. So I go to the nail bar to improve my mood.\n\n\u201cI love to share my experience to inspire other people not just in my country but people around the world. Having a mental condition does not mean you are ineffective, but with medication and therapy you can contribute to society.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Graeme Moffatt pictured here as a child. Photograph: Handout\n\nGraeme Moffat, who lives in Glasgow, has a similar fall-and-rise story that dates back more than 25 years to the day he broke his back when he fell from a tree as a teenager.\n\nHe said: \u201cI suffered in silence for so long because I thought I was alone. That\u2019s how your mind works. I never want anyone to feel the way I felt when I thought it was just me. So I started being open about the journey I was going through.\u201d\n\nA grocery bag represents the lowest ebb for Moffatt when he collapsed in a supermarket. For him, the exhibition is about normalising mental illness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to have tough times,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can get through it. You can even gain from going through these challenges \u2013 you have more empathy, more understanding, you can end up so much stronger and more capable.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the saddest story belongs to Stuart and Annette Baker, whose daughter Mary killed herself after a three-year struggle with an eating disorder. The couple have been tireless advocates for suicide prevention and openness about mental illness in the eight years since.\n\nRiding boots and an annotated book are the physical reminders of Mary\u2019s life \u2013 a girl who loved to ride horses, play water polo, write poetry, dive. Remarkably, eight years after her death, her parents are still able to see beyond what was lost to glimpse what they have discovered.\n\n\u201cMary\u2019s potential was lost,\u201d said Stuart, \u201cbut possibly there is purpose in what we have been doing. I\u2019m hopeful that maybe we are about to see an improvement in what we are doing with our mentally ill.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mary Baker, with brothers Henri and Jack, a year before she took her life.
