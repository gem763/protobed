That was faster than the 23.2% gain reported for the first half.\n\nThe announcement followed U.S.-Chinese trade talks in Washington that ended Friday with no word of progress on resolving Huawei\u2019s status.\n\nThe Trump administration, which accuses Huawei of being a security risk, imposed curbs in May on its access to U.S. technology and components including Google\u2019s music, maps and other smartphone services.\n\nWashington has delayed enforcement and suggested it might allow sales of some U.S. technology. But Huawei\u2019s chairman, Liang Hua, warned in July it would \u201cface difficulties\u201d in the second half.\n\nHuawei says it is removing U.S. components from its smartphones and network gear and has announced its own phone operating system to replace Google\u2019s Android if necessary.\n\nBut no non-U.S. supplier can fully replace Google music, maps and other services. Industry analysts say that might threaten Huawei\u2019s status as the No. 2 global smartphone brand behind Samsung by sales volume.\n\nHuawei said smartphone shipments rose 26% in the first nine months of 2019 over a year earlier, to 185 million units.\n\nU.S. security warnings focus on Huawei\u2019s status as the biggest supplier of network gear that forms the heart of telecom networks. Huawei denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying or might install \u201cbackdoors\u201d in its equipment for eavesdropping.\n\nThe company, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is a leader in next-generation network technology meant to support self-driving cars and other new applications. Its increased reach makes 5G technology more politically sensitive.\n\nWashington is lobbying European and other allies to ban Huawei from plans to upgrade networks to 5G. Germany, France and Ireland say they have no plans to ban any supplier.\n\nA U.S. official on Tuesday warned that Washington would reconsider sharing intelligence with allies that use Huawei network equipment.", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Chinese tech giant Huawei on Wednesday reported a double-digit gain in sales despite U.S. sanctions that threaten to disrupt its smartphone", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/16/9bf3da_china-huawei-13600-in-2019-file-photo-logo-huawei-is-displayed-shop-in-shenzhen-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
