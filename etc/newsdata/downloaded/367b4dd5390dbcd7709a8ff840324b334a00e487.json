Rescuers were working late Monday to extract a fourth crew member trapped behind glass on a separate deck.\n\nThe rescue followed nearly 36 hours of work after the Golden Ray, a giant ship that carries automobiles, rolled onto its side early Sunday as it was leaving Brunswick, Ga., bound for Baltimore.\n\nIn the hours immediately after the accident, the Coast Guard lifted 20 crew members into helicopters before determining that smoke and flames and unstable cargo made it too risky to venture further inside the vessel. Officials were also concerned about the stability of the ship, which was carrying 4,000 vehicles, some of which may have broken loose.\n\nThat left responders looking for the remaining four crew members. But by dawn Monday, they had grown confident that taps they were hearing from the vessel were responses to their own taps, indicating someone was alive inside and leading rescuers to the right place on the 656-foot vessel.\n\nA crew member of the Golden Ray is helped off the ship Monday, in an image released by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Lloyd Heflin, who was coordinating the search, said they found three men in a room close to the propeller shaft, near the bottom of the stern. Responders began drilling, starting with a 3-inch hole, and eventually making an opening large enough to insert a ladder and help the men climb out.\n\nThe Golden Ray is now stuck in the shipping channel, closing one of the busiest U.S. seaports for shipping automobiles. One ship is unable to leave port and four more are lined up outside waiting to come in, according to ship-tracking website Marine Traffic.\n\nThe South Korea foreign ministry said 10 South Koreans and 13 Filipinos had been on board, along with a U.S. harbor pilot, when the ship began tilting.\n\nThe cause of the capsizing remains under investigation. Marine Traffic shows the Golden Ray overturned as it was passed by another car carrier entering St. Simons Sound.\n\nThe vessel is owned by Hyundai Glovis , which carries cars for auto makers Hyundai and Kia as well as others.\n\nNearly 614,000 vehicles and heavy machinery units moved across Brunswick\u2019s docks in the year that ended June 30, according to the Georgia Ports Authority.\n\n\u2014Copyright 2019 the Associated Press", "description": "Coast Guard rescuers began pulling trapped crew members from a capsized cargo ship, finding them alive more than a day after the vessel overturned while leaving a port on the Georgia coast.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105509/social", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
