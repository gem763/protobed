This is not America. The Democratic party doesn\u2019t represent America anymore,\u201d the Academy Award-winner told the entertainment magazine.\n\nFurther, Voight condemned Hollywood leftists for attacking \u201canybody who is for Trump or who is for the Republican party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democratic party has been undermined and overtaken, and I wish it could recoup itself and that there could be people who would stand up for the Democratic party that we have known and we have counted on and there are not anybody in that group who is standing up and protecting it. They are falling in,\u201d he said.\n\nVoight also predicted President Trump will win back the White House in 2020 irrespective of the House Democrats\u2019 formal impeachment inquiry, who he previously branded a \u201cwar against truths.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is going to win the presidency once again and this is going to be proven to be nonsense just as the two years with [the Mueller Report] and millions of dollars wasted and has taken those people in the House who are Democrats away from doing the business of the people,\u201d he stated.", "description": "Legendary\u00a0Hollywood actor\u00a0Jon Voight ripped the Democrat Party in an interview published Wednesday, saying its lawmakers no longer represent the interests of the United States and the American people.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/jonvoight1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
