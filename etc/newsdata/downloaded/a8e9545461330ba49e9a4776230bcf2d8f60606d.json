Kenneth Gallagher.\n\nShe alleges police escalated the situation and lied to a grand jury about what happened on the beach over Memorial Day weekend last year when Weinman repeatedly refused to give officers her name when they questioned her about the presence of alcohol on the beach.\n\nA video shot by a nearby beachgoer showed an officer punching her twice in the head as she lies on the sand, her legs flailing.\n\nShe pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in February.\n\nEmily Weinman was indicted last year on two counts of aggravated assault of police, resisting arrest, throwing bodily fluids, and obstruction. She's now filing a federal lawsuit against Wildwood and three police officers\n\nThis shocking video shows the moment a New Jersey officer repeatedly punched Emily Weinman in the head during an arrest on Memorial Day weekend 2018\n\nMayor Ernie Troiano Jr. told NJ.com the lawsuit was 'frivolous' and 'a money grab.'\n\nThe officers were cleared of wrongdoing after previously being under an non-criminal but internal investigation..\n\nBody cam footage and bystander video from the incident on Wildwood Beach where the she celebrated Memorial Day with her 18-month-old daughter, shows the scuffle with Thomas Cannon and Robert Jordan.\n\nWeinman's attorney Stephen Dicht was furious about the outcome from the Cape May Grand Jury, telling the Post: 'We welcome the chance to vindicate Emily and show that police are the culprit in this case, not her.'\n\nIt started when officers came up to the Philadelphia woman and questioned her about unopened bottles of Twisted Tea.\n\nTo prove she hadn't been drinking, Weinman took and passed two breathalyzer tests, but refused to cooperate with the cops further when they demanded that she give them her last name.\n\nWitnesses recorded the officers then tackling Weinman to the ground, Cannon hitting her twice in the head, as they struggled to put her into handcuffs.\n\nWhen the video started going viral online, the officers received more attention as Weinman appeared on TV shows.\n\nIn an interview on CBS at the time, she said it was unfair how she was treated and claimed the officers thought they were above the law which, she says, they have proven to be.\n\n'They think that because they're cops they can get away with it and that's not the case, that's not right at all.\n\n'In my eyes, I\u2019m not a criminal. I\u2019m not a bad person,' she said.\n\nShe's now filing a federal lawsuit against Wildwood and three police officers (pictured in court with her lawyers)\n\nIn an earlier interview on GMA, Weinman said the experience had been 'emotionally exhausting' for her.\n\nWeinman said she 'didn't really see the point' in giving the officers her name.\n\n'Something in my gut was just telling me something wasn't right with the situation and I just knew in my rights I didn't have to give them my name due to everything that they did. I cooperated and, like I said, I did everything that they asked to,' she said.\n\nWhen asked if the reason she didn't want to give her name was because she was on probation for another 2016 arrest, Weinman responded: 'No, not mainly, no.'\n\nShe was also questioned about the officers' allegation that she was the first to strike.\n\n'No, I didn't,' Weinman said.\n\nThe officers said she also kicked and spit at them. While Weinman said she may have kicked after they started being forceful with her, she never intended to spit at them.\n\nHer lawyer said there's no video supporting she threw bodily fluids at them according to NBC News.\n\n'When he smashed my head into the ground I got sand in my mouth, so when they got me to the point where they got me on my stomach, you know, after I was like done struggling, trying to defend myself, I spit the sand in my mouth which makes me look like I was spitting at the officer, but that wasn't the case and it definitely wasn't my intention at all,' she said.", "description": "Emily Weinman was indicted\u00a0last year on two counts of aggravated assault of police, resisting arrest, throwing bodily fluidsin Wildwood, New Jersey.
