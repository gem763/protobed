I would expect us to support that.\u201d\n\nPressed on why Labour would support a second referendum, keeping Johnson in power for months to come, rather than an election, Chapman said: \u201cI would rather have a general election but we are not in control on this. So should that opportunity come on Saturday, to have that referendum on a deal \u2026 the pragmatic, sensible thing for the Labour party to do, given we\u2019ve been asking this, would be to take that opportunity.\u201d\n\nHer remarks indicate a shift in position since Corbyn suggested he would only support a referendum on a deal that accorded with Labour\u2019s \u201cfive pillars\u201d including a customs union and more protections for workers\u2019 rights. The Labour leader also cautioned MPs as recently as this weekend against the idea of a referendum on a Johnson-backed deal.\n\nAsked whether Corbyn had been told of the position, Chapman said: \u201cHe\u2019s told me this \u2026 I\u2019m telling you today what the situation is. I think on Saturday if there is that opportunity that the Labour party will take it.\u201d Asked if Labour would go for a general election if it cannot get a referendum, she said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nLabour MPs pushing for a second referendum said they believed the numbers would now be pretty close as many pro-deal backbenchers on both the Labour and former Tory/independent side are balking at the hardness of the Brexit being proposed by Johnson.\n\nLabour sources said the party\u2019s position would depend on the amendment but there could be a motion that allowed it to support a referendum while making clear MPs rejected Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.", "description": "Jenny Chapman, shadow Brexit minister, indicates shift in position by party", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dee23094b90fad12964996b44749b724980d37d/16_201_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b6a03cf59eef170c918ae65f9d62b6c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
