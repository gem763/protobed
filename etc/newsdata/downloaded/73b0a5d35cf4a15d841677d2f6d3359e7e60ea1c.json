The trade will be made official after the players involved pass a physical exam.\n\nPRO BOWLER JADEVEON CLOWNEY TRADED TO SEAHAWKS IN MULTIPLAYER DEAL: REPORTS\n\nTunsil, the 13th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, immediately improves a Houston line which allowed Deshaun Watson to be sacked an NFL-leading 62 times last season.\n\nThe move leaves the Dolphins without arguably their best player and comes on the heels of a Miami Herald report that stated the team's locker room would \"revolt\" if Tunsil was traded.\n\n\u201cThe backlash would be amazing,\u201d a source told the paper. \u201cGuys would legit revolt.\u201d\n\nStills, 27, who spent the last four seasons with Miami, recently criticized Dolphins' owner Stephen Ross for putting on a fundraiser for President Donald Trump, and looked askance at rapper Jay-Z's recent partnership with the NFL.\n\nIn response, Dolphins head coach Brian Flores played eight straight Jay-Z songs during a training camp practice, calling it a challenge to the receiver to improve his performance.\n\nMIAMI DOLPHINS PLAYERS VOW 'REVOLT' IF TOP OFFENSIVE LINEMAN GETS TRADED: REPORT\n\n\"I would say, and I said this to him, he hasn't performed up to that level over the course of training camp, or as I've seen. So that was the challenge, to get open, catch the football and make plays for this team, regardless of what's going on outside of this building,\" Flores said.\n\nNow it appears instead of cutting the wide receiver, the Dolphins are letting the Texans pick up his $7,975,000 base salary for 2019.\n\nTunsil's salary is a manageable $2.15 million for this season before jumping to $10.35 million in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollowing the trade, Miami looks to be in full rebuilding mode and the team now has a myriad of picks in the 2020 and 2021 NFL drafts. They now have four first-rounders and four second-rounders in the next two NFL drafts.\n\nThe Dolphins have repeatedly denied they're tanking in 2019. But they're widely expected to be among the NFL's worst teams, and the trade increases the likelihood they'll secure a high draft pick and take a franchise quarterback in the first round next April.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The Miami Dolphins are trading\u00a0left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Kenny Stills to the Houston Texans for two first-round picks, a second-round pick, offensive tackle Juli\u00e9n Davenport and cornerback Johnson Bademosi, according to multiple reports.", "authors": ["David Aaro", "David Aaro Is A Freelance Reporter At Fox News Digital Based In New York City."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/050716-fsf-nfl-miami-dolphins-tunsi-34c5d9e5ceb84510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg"}
