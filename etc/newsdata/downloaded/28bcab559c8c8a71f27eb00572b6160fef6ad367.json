REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nDemocrats hoping to thwart his bid for a second term say, however, that Trump\u2019s economy has only benefited the rich while leaving behind the working class. Many are proposing broad changes such as a rollback of Trump\u2019s tax cuts and free college tuition.\n\nOne sign of how broad the appetite for change is among Democrats: All but one of the dozen candidates who qualified for the Oct. 15 Democratic debate want to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25.\n\nThe one who did not support such an increase, businessman Andrew Yang, instead wants to pay every American adult $1,000 per month.\n\nHere are some of the views of the top 2020 presidential candidates on jobs, taxes and government assistance.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump\n\nTrump credits his administration\u2019s efforts to deregulate industries and cut taxes for a bullish stock market and a historically low unemployment rate.\n\n\u201cDo you think it was luck that got us to the best Stock Market and Economy in our history,\u201d the president asked on Twitter last month. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nYet economic growth rates have slowed this year as the benefits of the 2017 tax cut fade and tariffs imposed on Chinese imports hurt American farmers and manufacturers.\n\nTrump is now considering additional tax cuts for the middle class, and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in September that such a plan would be announced in mid-2020.\n\nTrump also wants to make new investments in infrastructure, from roads to airports, and negotiate new trade deals, particularly with China.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\n\nBiden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, would roll back some of the 2017 tax cuts. Doing so would help pay for his plans to improve and expand the Affordable Care Act, formally known as Obamacare, which was passed in 2010 but which Trump has sought to replace.\n\nBiden wants to roll back some of Trump\u2019s tax cuts by raising the marginal tax rate on the highest income earners back to 39.6%, from 37%, and would also raise some taxes on investment profit.\n\nLike many of the Democratic candidates, he also supports expanding some tax credits for lower-income workers and raising the federal minimum wage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to reward work, not just wealth,\u201d Biden says regularly in campaign events. Yet Biden has stopped short of endorsing some of the more aggressive economic proposals of his rivals, from universal income guarantees to imposing federal taxes on wealth.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana\n\nHailing from a city ravaged by the loss of automobile manufacturing, Buttigieg has emphasized efforts to renew a U.S. economy he sees as tilted to the wealthy.\n\n\u201cOur country is in trouble,\u201d he said in a debate in July. \u201cGDP is going up and life expectancy is going down. Think about what that means. And it\u2019s only getting tougher.\u201d\n\nButtigieg proposes plans to pour billions of dollars of investment into the African-American community and into rural areas. He has also proposed legislation requiring companies to disclose gender pay disparities and boosting paid sick leave and family-leave policies.\n\nU.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California\n\nThe former prosecutor supports reversing Trump\u2019s tax cut on corporations and high-paid workers and using the extra revenue to expand tax rebates for the middle class.\n\nHarris also wants to expand support for college tuition and paid family leave and provide tax credits to people who spend at least 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities.\n\nShe proposes paying for a proposed expansion of government-provided healthcare benefits by raising taxes on companies and the top 1% of income earners, as well as new levies on stock and bond transactions.\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont\n\nSanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont and a self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d won a devoted following with a message during the 2016 Democratic nominating race about income and wealth inequality.\n\nIn his second run for the party\u2019s nomination, Sanders has rolled out aggressive proposals, including guaranteeing all Americans a job, canceling student loan and medical debt, paying for tuition-free public colleges and raising taxes on the wealthy.\n\nSanders and a fellow progressive presidential candidate, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also support a wealth tax.\n\nSanders said his proposed \u201ctax on extreme wealth\u201d would begin at 1% for those with a net worth above $32 million and rise in increments to 8% on wealth over $10 billion, hitting the wealthiest 180,000 Americans.\n\nMany of Sanders\u2019 proposals, however, are controversial and seem unlikely to garner the necessary support from Congress if the Senate stays in Republican hands after next year\u2019s elections.\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\n\nBefore joining Congress, Warren rose to prominence for pushing to strengthen consumer protection after the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, she has become known for a sweeping series of plans for economic reforms, including a wealth tax. That plan would tax 2% of people\u2019s net worth above $50 million and 3% for wealth over $1 billion.\n\nWarren also supports hiking Social Security benefits for older Americans, canceling some student-loan debt, making tuition free at public colleges and breaking up technology companies, such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Apple Inc, which she regards as monopolies.\n\nU.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey\n\nBooker has focused his campaign on the \u201ccommon pain\u201d felt by Americans because of racial and wealth inequality.\n\n\u201cThe dream of this country is under threat right now,\u201d he said at a Democratic debate in July, noting that young people now may end up in worse shape financially than their parents.\n\nThe former Newark, New Jersey, mayor proposes giving American newborns $1,000 each and making additional annual contributions to the savings accounts of children from lower-income households.\n\nThe proposal is intended to give more people a chance at homeownership by giving them some cash that they could use to buy a house, but Booker would also propose giving renters a tax credit so they would not have to pay more than 30 percent of their income on shelter.\n\nBooker also supports expanding tax credits and creating \u201ca path to debt-free college.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas\n\nO\u2019Rourke, a native of the U.S.-Mexican border town El Paso, has blasted Trump\u2019s use of tariffs as a \u201chuge mistake\u201d and has vowed to suspend them on his first day in office.\n\nTariffs \u201cconstitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer, hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard, and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said at a July Democratic debate. \u201cWhen have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without allies, friends and partners?\u201d\n\nThe former U.S. congressman proposes imposing new taxes on financial transactions, raising Social Security benefits as well as directing government contracts to small businesses and those owned by women and ethnic minorities.\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang\n\nThe former tech executive is focusing his campaign on what he calls the \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d - Yang wants to give all Americans over the age of 18 a $1,000 check every month.\n\nHe has pitched the idea to support the economy, lift people out of poverty and help workers displaced by increasing automation.\n\nYang has proposed paying for the new benefit partly by levying a 10% value-added tax, a fee attached to purchases made by businesses and consumers.\n\nHe would also propose lifting taxes on capital gains and carried interest, two types of profit earned on investments, as well as introducing a new tax on financial transactions.\n\nFormer U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro\n\nCastro, who was housing secretary under former President Barack Obama, wants to provide new tax rebates to low-income renters and developers of affordable housing. He also supports increasing tax rebates available to some parents and expanding childcare benefits.\n\nHe would pay for the benefits by imposing a new tax on inheritances over $2 million and repeal Republicans\u2019 2017 tax cuts within his first 100 days as president.\n\nU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota\n\nKlobuchar, who has sponsored or co-sponsored more than 100 bills that became law, has proposed a list of more than 100 actions she wants to take in her first 100 days as president.\n\nThey include directing her attorney general to review mergers that have already taken place to prevent monopolies from forming, allowing students to refinance loans at lower interest rates and repealing part of the Trump tax cuts.\n\nFormer hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer\n\nTom Steyer, a former investor who is the only billionaire among the Democratic candidates, has said he supports a tax that would cut his own wealth.\n\nHe has proposed charging people with a net worth over $32 million a new 1% tax.\n\nFor middle-income workers, he wants to increase tax rebates and retirement benefits. He also plans to guarantee two years of free college, refinance student loans at lower interest rates and increase investment in infrastructure.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nU.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii\n\nThe Iraq war veteran and congresswoman from Hawaii has centered her campaign on her anti-war stance, not the economy. But she has also said she would serve \u201cthe interests of all Americans, not just the rich and powerful\u201d as president and said that many Americans had struggled financially since the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nShe has advocated taking money currently spent on the military and \u201ctax giveaways\u201d to wealthy people and corporations and using that to expand Social Security programs for the old and disabled.", "description": "Republican Donald Trump is touting tax cuts and economic gains during his presidency as a reason why he should get re-elected in November 2020.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439217781&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990SR", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
