Malaak Jamal is the policy officer at the Human Rights Foundation.\n\nOn Friday, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for his democratic reforms and peacemaking efforts with Eritrea. Under Abiy, Ethiopia\u2019s government has released thousands of political prisoners, ended restrictions on previously banned opposition groups and committed to having free elections in 2020.\n\nIn this context, the opportunity to reconcile Ethiopia\u2019s ethnic tensions has rarely been this attainable. But the battle for peace and democratic change is not over yet: Abiy is facing a number of complex challenges, and this opportunity could still slip away if he decides to pursue authoritarian measures.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s political terrain has been difficult for Abiy to navigate since his 2018 appointment. His rise has further exposed deep historical divisions within Ethiopia\u2019s nine constitutionally mandated ethnic federal states. These divisions have been marked by violent conflict among ethnic groups, insurgents and the military; some groups have even made demands for secession. As of 2019, 2.9 million people had been displaced by ethnic violence, with deadly clashes over territorial disputes and political representation.\n\nTo defuse ethnic tensions and take steps toward lasting peace, Abiy and Ethiopia should invest in the country\u2019s newly established national reconciliation commission, similar to that set up after the end of apartheid in South Africa. In February, prominent figures, including politicians, faith leaders and intellectuals, were appointed to this commission, accountable to Abiy and tasked with determining the root causes of Ethiopia\u2019s conflict. The power of a truth and reconciliation commission lies in its opportunity for restorative \u2014 versus solely retributive \u2014 justice. Allowing Ethiopians to take part in the creation of a historical account of harms could play a key role in placing the country on the path toward democracy.\n\nBut while a commission would mitigate the anger and resentment that plague Ethiopian society, very few local community leaders \u2014 those most directly affected \u2014 were actually appointed. And, some members of Parliament who doubt the existence of any ethnic conflict have questioned who the commission would reconcile, highlighting an ever-present naivete.\n\nIn fact, some Ethiopians openly express nostalgia for the era of former dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was responsible for thousands of deaths at the hands of the military junta, the Derg. They call Mengistu a champion of nationalism, saying that during his reign, there was no such thing as \u201cethnicity.\u201d\n\nOne need only look south to Rwanda to see how such misguided ethnic sentiments can play out. Following Rwanda\u2019s 1994 genocide, positive steps were first taken by local communities to address the atrocities and facilitate the process of reconciliation. Importantly, through grass-roots gacaca (genocide) courts, victims and perpetrators gathered in towns to work through how they could go on living side by side and forgive one another.\n\nBut this is only part of the story. The other, less discussed reality for Rwanda \u2014 beyond this semblance of collective healing \u2014 is that because Rwanda is not a free society, authoritarian tactics have thwarted local communities\u2019 progress in their bottom-up approach to healing. President Paul Kagame\u2019s authoritarian policies insist on a \u201cpost-ethnic\u201d narrative, in which ethnicity \u2014 when acknowledged \u2014 is simply called a \u201cconstruct\u201d and not fact.\n\nIn Rwanda, authoritarian efforts to conceal human rights abuses went hand in hand with the creation of a homogeneous national identity that completely erased decades of ethnic identities. Kagame and his regime have taken extreme measures \u2014 masked as reducing deadly ethnic tensions \u2014 to eliminate individual freedoms and silence opposing views; many Rwandans are afraid to even say the word \u201cHutu\u201d or \u201cTutsi.\u201d The state employs propaganda campaigns, arrests and assassinates opposition members, and quashes independent media.\n\nAnd in Ethiopia, despite Abiy\u2019s reforms, some of these authoritarian tactics have been replicated. Following the alleged coup attempt in June, the government shut down the Internet for 10 days and detained journalists on bogus charges under Ethiopia\u2019s anti-terrorism law. Alarmingly, Abiy cautioned that the Internet is \u201cneither water nor air\u201d and could be blocked at any time.\n\nIn this critical moment, Ethiopia must learn from Rwanda\u2019s mistakes. Abiy\u2019s experiences position him to avoid the \u201cpost-ethnic\u201d authoritarian model: He joined the liberation struggle against the Derg in 1990 and even served as a United Nations peacekeeper in Rwanda. But healing and forgiveness cannot be driven by one person alone.\n\nAbiy must empower actual victims to become a fundamental part of the truth and reconciliation process and ensure that an authoritarian top-down approach does not undermine the process of reconciliation and the progress made by local community efforts. The suffering of every ethnic group needs to be equally addressed by Ethiopia\u2019s commission, and all perpetrators held accountable for their wrongs.\n\nTwenty-five years after the genocide in Rwanda, with a Nobel Peace Prize to honor and propel a promising start \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 Ethiopia and Abiy must take heed not to follow in Kagame\u2019s footsteps, and unambiguously reject the slippery slope into authoritarianism.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Abiy Ahmed\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize is deserved, but he still has work to do in his country\n\nPaul Barrett: A new industry in Ethiopia is creating jobs.
