Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) told Breitbart News Daily that despite former Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s (R-AZ) contention, there are not 30 Republican senators who would back impeachment of President Donald Trump.\n\nBlackburn spoke with Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and other Democrats have marched towards impeaching Trump over his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nBlackburn said that by having the Democrats focus on impeachment, they do not have to fulfill their promises to the American people by lowering the cost of health care.\n\n\u201cAs long as they can keep the attention on impeachment, the Democrats in the House don\u2019t have to do anything. They don\u2019t have to move anything forward. They don\u2019t have to take actions on things,\u201d she said.\n\nBlackburn also said that Democrats want to bring the Senate Republican majority to a \u201chalt,\u201d preventing them from confirming more conservative justices to the federal courts.\n\nShe said that they have confirmed 155 judges under Trump, and that they have 40 more to confirm and are \u201ctrying to do anything to stop it.\u201d\n\nMarlow noted that not only does the media want to \u201cdivide the country,\u201d but they also want to create \u201cfissures\u201d within the Republican Party. Establishment media have tried to find any Republican willing to back impeachment of Trump.\n\nBlackburn also rebuked Flake\u2019s narrative that \u201cat least 35\u201d Republican senators would vote in favor of impeaching Trump if the vote were in private.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there are 20 or 30\u201d Republican senators who would vote in favor of impeachment, Blackburn charged.\n\nBlackburn said that Flake \u201cdoesn\u2019t like President Trump.\u201d She added that Republicans will be \u201cloyal to their party and loyal to their president.\u201d\n\nThe Tennessee conservative said that Pelosi \u201ccannot get by\u201d with just committee investigations on impeachment. She contended that House Democrats that won their seats in Trump districts do not want to take that vote for fear of losing their reelection in 2020.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Susan Wild (D-PA), a freshman congresswoman in a swing Pennsylvania district, said that moderate Democrats need to ensure that impeachment does not \u201covershadow\u201d their legislative agenda.\n\n\u201cAt some point, she\u2019s going to have to call the vote, and we know that those Democrats that won in Trump districts, they do not want to take that vote,\u201d she said.\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M.
