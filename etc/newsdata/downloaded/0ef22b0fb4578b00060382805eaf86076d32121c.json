It is time to recognise the humanity of drug users...the medical community must stand up for the rights of people with drug use disorders to receive evidence-based care.\u201d\n\nThe Lancet\u2019s move to publish a drugs issue exemplifies its history of taking a strong stance on public health and harm reduction, said Pamela Das, co-editor of the series. \"Many of the recommendations in the series are not new, but they continue to be dismissed despite the huge amount of scientific evidence of what works.\"\n\nThe authors of the paper on opioids said that although opioid dependence is the third-most damaging substance-use disorder after tobacco and alcohol, \u201ccoverage of interventions to prevention of opioid\u00ad related harms to health is woefully inadequate in most countries.\u201d It said the best way to combat this was by moving away from criminalization and expanding treatment using methadone and buprenorphine.\n\nAn analysis of legalized cannabis in the U.S. found that while it had reduced the illicit market and allowed governments to regulate and tax cannabis, potency had increased, adult use had risen and prices had fallen. It said claims that medical use of cannabis for pain relief has reduced deaths from opioid overdose is based on weak evidence.\n\nIt warned that by the time the true costs and benefits of legalization become available, \u201clegalisation might be difficult to reverse because a profitable commercial cannabis industry will have been created that contributes substantial revenue to governments.\u201d\n\nOn stimulants, the paper in The Lancet said that little had been done to tackle the rising problems around cocaine and amphetamines such as meth. \u201cNo effective pharmacotherapies are available that reduce stimulant use. The absence of an effective policy response to the scale and severity of harms related to stimulant use, combined with the fear and stigmatisation of so-\u00adcalled problem users, has restricted the allocation of resources to reduce stimulant \u00adrelated harms.\u201d\n\nIt said the world had instead relied on law enforcement to deal with the stimulant problem, most notably in Asia. \u201cGlobally, and particularly in the Asia\u00adPacific region, policy has been dominated by incarceration, with an estimated 235000 people detained in compulsory drug detention centres in which major infringements of human rights occur.\u201d\n\nFinally, in an impressive moment of prophecy, a paper looking at the expansion of new psychoactive substances quoted from a previous study, way back in 1988, which predicted with chilling accuracy our current state of affairs concerning fentanyl: \u201cThe future drugs of abuse will be synthetics rather than plant products. They will be synthesized from readily available chemicals. A single gram of any very potent drug...could be synthesized in one location, transported to distribution sites worldwide, and then formulated into many thousand, perhaps a million, doses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis editorial demonstrates frustration with the international policy paralysis that continues to cause harm to people when there is sufficient evidence to support the need for policy that sees these problems for what they are: human suffering borne out of social inequality,\u201d said Ian Hamilton, senior lecturer in addiction and health at the University of York in the U.K. \u201cThe Lancet\u2019s audience\u2014doctors, researchers, and policy makers\u2014will pay attention to this editorial position and the accompanying report. That matters, as these groups shape the health experience that people who have problems with drugs encounter.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.", "description": "A special drugs issue of The Lancet says doctors need to protect drug users from politicians who take a punitive approach.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db0b376961d150092a01e6c/lede/1571863498609-GettyImages-517239068.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8265004380841121xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
