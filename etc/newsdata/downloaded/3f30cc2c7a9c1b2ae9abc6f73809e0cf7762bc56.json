But many Republicans hadn\u2019t read the proposal, and don\u2019t plan to take it seriously unless Trump personally weighs in.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about what\u2019s floating around,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to do anything that the president isn\u2019t going to sign anyway.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the proposal, Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) first inquired if Trump publicly endorsed it as his own.\n\n\u201cOnce the president does, I\u2019ll look forward to reviewing it,\u201d Young said.\n\nBarr and White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland spent a second day Wednesday meeting with Republican senators to discuss expanding background checks, but no one is taking ownership of the document discussed at some of these meetings. The proposal would expand background checks to all commercial sales and create a new entity to perform them.\n\nRepublicans discussed the mixed messages in their lunch and how most of them needed to hear from the president before weighing in on anything on Wednesday, according to attendees.\n\nBarr wouldn\u2019t directly say whether the document came from the Justice Department, but Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said after meeting with Barr that the document \"there's no question that the heart of the attorney general's idea is a mechanism for expanding background checks beyond what we have today.\"\n\nA senator who met with Barr said that the attorney general made clear he had authorization from the White House.\n\nYet the White House seemed to brush off the proposal, creating confusion and echoing a consistent theme of the Trump presidency: when it comes to the president, only Trump speaks for Trump.\n\n\u201cThe president has not signed off on anything yet but has been clear he wants meaningful solutions that actually protect the American people and could potentially prevent these tragedies from ever happening again,\" said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman.\n\nAs far as the document circulating on the Hill, he added: \u201cThat is not a White House document, and any suggestion to the contrary is completely false.\u201d\n\nThe NRA is also not on board, with Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, calling it \u201ca non-starter with the NRA and our 5 million members because it burdens law-abiding gun owners while ignoring what actually matters: fixing the broken mental health system and the prosecution of violent criminals.\u201d\n\nThe release of actual paper documentation of discussions between senators and the White House rapidly accelerates the political debate over background checks. And the NRA\u2019s swift denouncement of the plan highlighted how much more difficult sensitive discussions become once they spill into the open.\n\n\u201cYou know what happens when people have a target,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who met with Barr this week. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know who leaked it, but obviously that wasn\u2019t the idea.\u201d\n\nIndeed, just hours after being first reported by the Daily Caller and obtained by POLITICO, the proposal was already taking on heavy water. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) said the proposal wasn\u2019t from the White House, was \u201cmaybe\u201d from the Justice Department and \u201cwouldn\u2019t support that\u201d regardless of where the proposal originated.\n\nBarr met this week with Cornyn and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), John Kennedy (R-La.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) this week and on Wednesday evening met with Toomey and Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who have been negotiating with the White House on expanding background checks. They said the 45-minute meeting was positive but there were no breakthroughs.\n\n\"The attorney general's bringing back the opinions of Republicans to the president,\" Murphy said. \"This is a complicated issue and it probably needs a creative solution to get to 60 votes. I can understand why the attorney general would want to spend some time up here surveying opinion before the White House firmly lands on a proposal.\"", "description": "Senators say they're unwilling to support any gun proposal until Trump endorses it.", "authors": ["Marianne Levine", "Burgess Everett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aGn3Fd6858tazT_ZUenpTw--~B/aD0yNjY2O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/769e39e36127bda1de9b28fadde38b55", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
