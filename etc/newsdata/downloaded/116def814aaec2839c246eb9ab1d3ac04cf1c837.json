(Oct. 7) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Longtime televangelist and ally to the president Pat Robertson said Trump is \u201cin danger of losing the mandate of heaven\u201d over his announcement that American forces will pull out of a region of Syria.\n\nCalling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan a dictator and a thug, Robertson said that he is \u201cabsolutely appalled that the United States is going to betray those democratic forces in northern Syria, that we are possibly going to allow the Turkish to come in against the Kurds.\u201d\n\nPat Robertson is \"appalled\" by Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria: \"The President of the United States is in great danger of losing the mandate of Heaven if he permits this to happen.\" pic.twitter.com/YGeNYpbGrF \u2014 Right Wing Watch (@RightWingWatch) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cTo say that (Erdo\u011fan) is an ally of America is nonsense. He is in it for himself,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nThe White House announced late Sunday that \"Turkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria. The United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation.\" Erdo\u011fan considers the Kurdish forces terrorists allied with insurgents inside his country.\n\nRobertson, who created the Christian Broadcast Network and is host of the 700 Club, made the comments during Monday's show.\n\nThough Robertson has been a consistent Trump defender, he continued to rip the decision, saying that \u201cthe president, who allowed (Washington Post journalist Jamal) Khashoggi to be cut in pieces without any repercussions whatsoever, is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I believe \u2014 and I want to say this with great solemnity \u2014 the President of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen,\u201d he concluded.\n\nRobertson\u2019s comment joins a flurry of criticism around the Syria decision from GOP lawmakers and commentators. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said \u201ca precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham who labeled the President\u2019s move as \u201cirresponsible\u201d and a \"stain on America's honor.\u201d Both have been stalwart allies to the president.\n\nFox and Friends Host Brian Kilmeade was visibly upset with the decision on Monday's show and called Trump\u2019s decision \u201cdisastrous.\" He questioned why any future ally would want to side with the U.S, exclaiming, \"What kind of message is that?\"\n\nBrian Kilmeade fights with his co-hosts over Trump throwing Syrian Kurds under the bus: \"What kind of message is that to the next ally that wants to side with us? ... All we did is arm them, and they did all the work. And now we say 'good luck. Good luck surviving.' Disaster.\" pic.twitter.com/ktyDqsM4lS \u2014 Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) October 7, 2019\n\nThe president has defended the plan, telling reporters in the Roosevelt Room Monday that \"It's time to come back home.\"\n\n\"We're 7,000 miles away,\" Trump said. \"I campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home.\"\n\nRobertson once declared that Trump was \"God's man for this job.\" Trump typically receives high praise from the Christian-right, and evangelicals strongly support him.\n\nA recent survey showed 77% of white evangelical Protestants approve of Trump\u2019s performance while those who report attending church weekly were more likely to approve than those who attend less often, 81% versus 73%.\n\nContributing: David Jackson, John Fritze, William Cummings, Deirdre Shesgreen, Ben Tobin\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/07/pat-robertson-trump-losing-mandate-heaven-over-syria-decision/3903941002/", "description": "The longtime televangelist and ally to the President said he was 'appalled', and continued to blast \u201cthe president who allowed Khashoggi to be cut in pieces\"", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
