The software giant is opening applications in the US, UK, and Korea today, and you can sign up right here. Microsoft hasn\u2019t put a specific date on xCloud public trials other than October, and the company is planning to \u201csend invites in the coming weeks\u201d to a \u201csmall number of participants.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft is keeping this initial preview small and select, even down to the number of games that xCloud testers will be able to play. \u201cIn the first phase of the Project xCloud public preview, featured games will be Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Killer Instinct and Sea of Thieves,\u201d explains a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. \u201cFor initial testing purposes, we aim to gather insights from engaged and active players from those communities. We\u2019ll continue to expand our content catalog over the course of the preview and will share more details in the near future.\u201d\n\nIf you want to test xCloud, you\u2019ll need an Android phone or tablet running Android 6.0 or above with Bluetooth 4.0 support, a Microsoft account, and a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One controller. Microsoft is launching a new Game Streaming app that will be available on the Google Play Store, but only beta participants will be able to sign into the app.\n\nMicrosoft is also working with some carriers to test xCloud on mobile networks. A 5G partnership with SK Telecom in South Korea will begin in the coming weeks, and Microsoft is also forming technical partnerships with T-Mobile in the US and Vodafone in the UK to better learn about how to optimize xCloud for mobile networks.\n\nMicrosoft still isn\u2019t disclosing any launch plans or even a business model for xCloud yet. The company appears to be taking things slowly, and the trial will continue until it hits Microsoft\u2019s standards for quality. A separate Game Streaming feature for Xbox One is still being worked on, which allows you to stream all of your own games to your phone. Microsoft promised at E3 that this would also be made available in preview in October.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s xCloud game streaming service is about to enter preview.
