I don\u2019t blame you. It used to feel a little risque stepping out in those spots; leopards were exotic. But then the High Street started intensively farming the look, and now school drop-off looks like a Bet Lynch convention. So it\u2019s the tiger\u2019s turn to earn his stripes. If you want to give a nod to fashion, rather than slavishly follow trends, this is the print for you.\n\nCAT WALK ON THE WILD SIDE\n\nCarolina Herrera has an incredible print box jacket with beautiful bell sleeves which costs thousands. Copenhagen-based Ganni has a more affordable tiger collection. From a green silk-blend maxi dress, \u00a3390, to a practical plastic raincoat, \u00a3230. Well, as practical as you can get for \u00a3230.\n\nDinah Van Tulleken advises on embracing this season's tiger print trend, pictured: Dress, \u00a3169, whistles.com; shoes, \u00a365, marksand spencer.com\n\nON THE PROWL FOR SOMETHING CHEAPER ?\n\nThe versatile dress I\u2019m wearing here (\u00a3169, whistles.com) can be worn day or night. The abstract nature of this print may prove more of a long-term investment than traditional tiger, but if it\u2019s trad you\u2019re after, All Saints has a fabulous brown and black shirt, \u00a3128. And, if Theresa May hasn\u2019t killed the animal print kitten heel for you, John Lewis has a wearable one (below).\n\nHOW TO DO IT\n\nIt\u2019s a fresh alternative to leopard, but can be worn in the same way \u2014 on midi dresses, pencil skirts, coats and accessories. Keep the rest of your outfit simple and accessories to a minimum. Wear with black court shoes or dress down with a pair of white trainers. It\u2019s the perfect way to combat that leopard-print fatigue.\n\nNOW SHOP THE TREND", "description": "Dinah Van Tulleken  advises on embracing this season's tiger print trend.
