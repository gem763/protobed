Dave Stull, 51, wanted to learn more about his biological parents after his adoptive mother and father died.\n\nHe said the possibility of brothers or sisters did not cross his mind but when he opened the link on the 23andMe website, the name topping the list of 1,200-plus potential relatives was that of a half brother, along with his photo.\n\nEric Reynolds had the same chin, different color eyes. 'He's wearing a police jacket, and it says Florida,' Stull said.\n\nEric Reynolds, left, and Dave Stull, right, both police officers, pose for a picture in Orlando. They recently found out they were half brothers though a DNA test\n\nThe moment the two half brothers met for the first time. Stull, a sergeant in the Orange County Sheriff's Office, took a DNA test and the results turned up Reynolds as his half brother\n\nThe first email David Stull sent his half brother Eric Reynolds. The two texted all day, talking about everything from their shared obsession with Tito's vodka and dental floss picks to the daily struggles and quiet fears they both experience as police officers\n\nStull, who has been married for 20 years helping to raise two children, then messaged Reynolds to tell him he thought they may be half-brothers.\n\nDad-of-two Reynolds was having breakfast with his police partner when he first found out about the sibling from Florida.\n\n'Good morning, my name is David Stull. We are half-brothers,' the email read. 'I don't know the validity of this but apparently we both live in Florida and we're both cops.'\n\nReynolds' first thought was, 'I'm being scammed,' but he ended up texting back.\n\n'I'm 49 I've got two boys and I live in Boynton,' he wrote.\n\n'I'm 50. That makes me the big brother. LOL,' Stull texted back.\n\nThe two texted all day, talking about everything from their shared obsession with Tito's vodka and dental floss picks to the daily struggles and quiet fears they both experience as police officers.\n\nStull currently runs a tactical unit at an Orlando area courthouse. His newly discovered half-brother Eric was an evidence expert with Boynton Beach Police.\n\nReynold's mother had been an officer with Miami-Dade Police in the 1980s and he followed her footsteps. He retired this month and wants to take his family across the country in an RV.\n\nReynolds said he had always known his dad, an Air Force man, was a bit of a womanizer and had been married five times.\n\nHe has three half-siblings, but he is at least 14 years older and grew up in a different state than they did, so he often felt like an only child.\n\nThe two, pictured hugging, texted all day before meeting for the first time at Stull's house. They have since been away together and are planning more RV trips next year\n\nStull, right, currently runs a tactical unit at an Orlando area courthouse. His newly discovered half-brother Eric, left was an evidence expert with Boynton Beach Police\n\nBoth men discovered they each started in retail security but later joined the police force because they were drawn to the idea of 'catching bad guys,' Reynolds said. They share the feeling that they are 'warrior spirits' and protectors of the flock.\n\n'Of course, there were questions in my whole life about, 'Who am I?' and 'Where did I come from?' and all that, but they weren't burning questions,' said Stull who was adopted as a baby by a Navy pilot and his wife.\n\nBut after losing his mother to Alzheimer's 20 years ago and watching his adoptive father die of heart disease just last year, he felt less guilty about tracing his biological roots.\n\nDNA kits such as Ancestry and 23andMe have exploded in popularity in recent years, with more than 26 million people taking an at-home test, according to MIT Technology Review.\n\nWhile the trend has populated the news with heartwarming stories of reunited family members, it also has posed ethical questions about situations that were supposed to remain private, such as anonymous sperm donors, adoptions, and children born out of wedlock or as the result of affairs.\n\nThe two men have their differences, too. They don't see eye to eye on religion. Stull said he's more compulsive about having things a certain way.\n\nAnd when the half brothers finally video chatted, it was awkward and hard to focus.\n\n'We're trying to talk but we're just staring at each other,' said Reynolds. 'I'm looking at his ears, his nose. He's looking at me the same way.'\n\nBut after meeting for the first time at Stull's house near Orlando the pair found themselves talking late into the night.\n\nThey then had a brother-bonding RV weekend, just the two of them, to talk about 'the good stuff,' Reynolds said.\n\n''Who was the first girl you hooked up with?'' and ''Who was your first crush?''\n\n'He got caught forging a report card just like I did,' Reynolds said of Stull.\n\nReynolds said it feels a bit like elementary school, like having a new best friend. The brothers text all day long. Reynolds' wife jokes that it's like they're having an affair.\n\nStull retires next summer, and the brothers are already planning their RV trips together. 'We've got 50 years to make up for,' Stull said.", "description": "Dave Stull, main right, adopted as a baby, wanted to learn more about his biological parents.
