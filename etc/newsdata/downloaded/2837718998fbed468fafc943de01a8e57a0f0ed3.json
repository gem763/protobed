Pictured, an artist's impression showing T. rex's ferocious bite, with the researcher's muscle model superimposed on top\n\nWHAT WAS T. REX? Tyrannosaurs rex was a species of bird-like, meat-eating dinosaur. It lived between 68\u201366 million years ago in what is now the western side of North America. They could reach up to 40 feet (12 metres) long and 12 feet (4 metres) tall. More than 50 fossilised specimens of T. rex have been collected to date. The monstrous animal had one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom. An artist's impression of T. rex\n\n'The T. rex had a skull that's 6 feet long, 5 feet wide and 4 feet high \u2014 and bit with the force of about 6 tons,' said Kaleb Sellers, an anatomist at the University of Missouri.\n\n'Previous researchers looked at this from a bone-only perspective without taking into account all of the connections \u2014 ligaments and cartilage \u2014 that really mediate the interactions between the bones.'\n\nTo address this, Mr Sellers and colleagues created the first ever 3D model of a T. rex that shows how the dinosaur's skull ligaments and joints work.\n\nThis allowed them to explore how the roof of a T. rex's mouth would have reacted to the stresses and strains of chewing.\n\nThe team built their model using analysis of fossil T. rex skulls, as well as models of two of the dinosaur's modern-day relatives \u2014 a gecko and a parrot.\n\n'Dinosaurs are like modern-day birds, crocodiles and lizards in that they inherited particular joints in their skulls from fish \u2014 ball and socket joints, much like people's hip joints,' said paper author and anatomist Casey Holliday.\n\nThese, he added, typically lend themselves to 'movement like in snakes.'\n\n'When you put a lot of force on things, there's a trade-off between movement and stability. Birds and lizards have more movement but less stability.'\n\n'When we applied their individual movements to the T. rex skull, we saw it did not like being wiggled in ways that the lizard and bird skulls do \u2014 which suggests more stiffness.'\n\nA 3D model of the famous dinosaur's head joints and ligaments showed that it had skull that were similar to those found in modern-day crocodiles and hyenas\n\nThe ability to model how joints and ligaments interact may have applications beyond the study of fossilised prehistoric animals, the researchers say.\n\nIn addition to helping palaeontologists with a detailed study of the anatomy of fossilised animals, researchers believe their findings can help advance human and animal medicine.\n\n'In humans this can also be applied to how people's jaws work, such as studying how the jaw joint is loaded by stresses and strains during chewing,' said paper author Ian Cost, a biologist at Pennsylvania's Albright College.\n\n'Understanding how those movements occur and joints are loaded will, for instance, help veterinarians better understand how to treat exotic animals such as parrots, which suffer from arthritis in their faces.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal The Anatomical Record.", "description": "Anatomists led from the  University of Missouri created the first ever 3D model of a T. rex that shows how the dinosaur's skull ligaments and joints work.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/26/13/18962768-0-image-a-5_1569500312794.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
